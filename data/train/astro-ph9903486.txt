    "characterization of the initial distribution of density perturbations and understanding their subsequent evolution into present - day structures are among the central aims of cosmology .",
    "particular attention has been focused on the low - redshift distribution of matter over large scales , which can probe the linear physics of the early universe and therefore test models for the origin of large - scale structure , such as inflation .",
    "the @xmath3-point correlation functions - point cfs are valid statistics only if the universe is homogeneous on large scales .",
    "we invoke the assumptions of large - scale homogeneity and isotropy , so that the cfs depend only relative distances and are independent of orientation . ]",
    "( cfs ) have become the most widely used statistical tools to quantify the observed distribution of matter , in part because they can be easily related to the predictions of such models and thus discriminate between them . in principle , recovering the current distribution of density perturbations is straightforward ; one simply maps the three - dimensional distribution of mass with a sufficiently large redshift survey .",
    "existing redshift surveys , however , typically contain relatively small numbers of objects , have inconvenient shapes , and necessarily suffer from redshift - space distortions , all of which make it difficult to obtain precise cf measurements , particularly for the higher - order functions .",
    "another possibility is to map the angular distribution of galaxies as projected onto the surface of the sky .",
    "angular surveys can sample larger volumes of space and contain greater numbers of objects .",
    "furthermore , the effects of redshift distortions need not be considered in an angular survey .",
    "thus , if the redshift distribution is well constrained , as is often the case for large angular surveys , angular cfs can in practice provide far greater statistical power and more insight into the evolution of clustering , than sparser , redshift - survey data ( groth & peebles 1977 ; fry & seldner 1982 ; jing , mo , & brner 1991 ; baugh & efstathiou 1993 ; cappi & maurogordato 1995 ; cress 1996 ; maddox , efstathiou & sutherland 1996 ; gaztaaga & baugh 1998 ; cress & kamionkowski 1998 ) .    to date , angular - clustering studies have focussed primarily on the angular two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) , @xmath4 , but with advent of new , deep surveys at various wavelengths ( radio , optical , ir , x - ray ) and more powerful computing resources , increasing attention is being focused on higher - order cfs .",
    "these are particularly important in assessing primordial gaussianity ( fry 1984 ; goroff 1986 ; bernardeau 1994 ; fry & scherrer 1994 ; gaztaaga & bernardeau 1998 ; white 1998 ; scoccimarro 1998 ; scoccimarro , couchman , & frieman 1998 ) , since to leading order they , unlike the 2pcf , reflect the inherently nonlinear gravitational amplification of the initial fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , they contain information about the cosmological parameters ( bouchet 1992 ; juszkiewicz , bouchet , & colombi 1993 ; gaztaaga , croft , & dalton 1995 ; bouchet 1995 ; catelan 1995 ; martel 1995 ; jing & brner 1997 ; szapudi 1998 ; kamionkowski & buchalter 1998 ) and about the nonlinear bias between the observed and underlying density distributions ( jensen & szalay 1986 ; szalay 1988 ; fry & gaztaaga 1993 ; frieman & gaztaaga 1994 ; fry 1994 ; jing 1997 ; matarrese , verde , & heavens 1997 ) , which can not be obtained from @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , the angular three - point correlation function ( 3pcf ) , @xmath5 , and relatedly , the normalized angular skewness , @xmath6 ( proportional to @xmath7 evaluated at zero lag , for a distribution smoothed over angular scale @xmath8 ) , are the lowest - order intrinsically nonlinear statistics and can therefore yield important constraints on models of structure formation .",
    "moreover , if different populations are differently biased relative to the underlying mass distribution then measuring the angular 3pcfs of these populations can provide multiple , complementary constraints .",
    "measurements of @xmath1 , as well as the normalized angular 3pcf , @xmath9 $ ] , over quasilinear ( ql ) scales have yielded results which appear to agree loosely with the predictions of the so - called hierarchical model ( peebles 1975 ; peebles 1980 ) for gravitational evolution of gaussian initial conditions ( peebles & groth 1975 ; fry & seldner 1982 ; jing & zhang 1989 ; tth , hollsi , & szalay 1989 ; borgani , jing , & plionis 1992 ; gaztaaga 1994 ; bernardeau 1995 ; cappi & maurogordato 1995 ; gaztaaga , croft , & dalton 1995 ; gaztaaga & bernardeau 1998 ; jing & brner 1998 ; magliocchetti 1998 ) .",
    "it is obvious , however , that improved measurements [ from surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; loveday 1998 ) ] and more sophisticated theoretical modeling of angular cfs are required . in particular , there has been little theoretical work to date on the detailed behavior of angular cfs beyond the two - point function , despite the practical advantages they can offer .    in this paper , we present a calculation of the full angular 3pcf .",
    "we have compared our results with theirs and find that they agree for some of the models we have considered .",
    "] , @xmath7 , as well as @xmath1 , for an arbitrary , biased , tracer - mass distribution in flat and open cold - dark - matter ( cdm ) models , assuming gaussian initial conditions .",
    "the calculation , based on leading - order pt results , is restricted to the ql regime , where @xmath10 , and further invokes the small - angle approximation .",
    "we take into account such factors as the explicit dependence on the cosmological parameters , the shape and linear evolution of the cdm power spectrum , and the form of redshift distribution function .",
    "we consider both the redshift distribution of the apm galaxy survey , as well as that of a survey with a mean redshift of @xmath2 .",
    "we also examine the effect of linear and nonlinear bias , which , through an extension of the fry ( 1996 ) bias - evolution model to the case of an arbitrary expansion history , are allowed to evolve in time .",
    "following bkj , we define the bias parameters , @xmath11 , by an expansion of the unsmoothed tracer - mass field in terms of the unsmoothed dark - matter field , rather than by relating the smoothed fields , as is often done ( e.g. , fry & gaztaaga 1993 ) . while many of the results we obtain are similar to those found in a related paper ( buchalter & kamionkowski 1999 , hereafter bk99 ) dealing with the spatial 3pcf and skewness , understanding the detailed behavior of angular statistics in practice can be equally , if not more , illuminating .",
    "we extend previous derivations of @xmath1 ( bernardeau 1995 ) to include a scale - dependent , leading - order correction which arises in the case of nonlinear bias , as defined for the unsmoothed fields , and which becomes large for positive effective power - spectrum indices .",
    "this behavior , in principle , may allow better constraints on the linear- and nonlinear - bias parameters on the basis of large - scale skewness measurements alone , or at least differentiate between the smoothed and unsmoothed biasing scenarios .",
    "for plausible models , we find that @xmath1 is relatively insensitive to the adopted cosmology , as compared with its stronger dependence on the biasing scheme . in general , the presence of linear bias tends to flatten and reduce the scale dependence of @xmath1 , while a nonlinear bias tends to produce a relative increase .",
    "the full angular 3pcf , @xmath7 , shows similar sensitivities to the bias parameters , but can also depend significantly on the cosmological model , and in particular on the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "we find that the configuration dependence of @xmath7 is in general more complex than the simple hierarchical model suggests , and , since angular statistics probe clustering over a range of redshifts , is also sensitive to evolutionary effects .",
    "these properties can be used to discriminate between various models which can yield nearly degenerate predictions for @xmath1 , or for the spatial 3pcf at @xmath12 , such as evolving versus non - evolving bias models , or open versus flat cosmological models .",
    "neglecting the full geometric and evolutionary variation of @xmath7 throws away valuable information which might , in practice , be harder to obtain from three - dimensional data .",
    "in several instances , we illustrate how accounting for time dependences in , e.g. , the power spectrum or the bias , can impact the resulting calculations , especially in the case of high - redshift surveys . our theoretical results , in general , should be comparable to current and future measurements of angular clustering .",
    "in  2 we outline the calculations used and present results for the normalized angular skewness . in ",
    "3 we derive predictions for the full angular 3pcf and in  4 we summarize our conclusions . since the calculations are greatly simplified by working initially in fourier space ,",
    "we first obtain the angular bispectrum  the two - dimensional projection of the spatial bispectrum  and then derive the angular 3pcf from this .",
    "a derivation of the equation that relates the spatial and angular bispectra is presented in the appendix .",
    "this result is essentially a fourier - space generalization of limber s equation for the 3pcf .",
    "since angular cfs involve projections of their full spatial counterparts , our derivations must involve integrals over the line of sight , which will in general depend on the adopted cosmological model .",
    "we shall consider open and flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmologies with a possible cosmological constant , so that the scale factor , @xmath13 , satisfies the friedmann equations , @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the present nonrelativistic matter density in units of the critical density , @xmath16 is the contribution of the cosmological constant to the total present energy density , @xmath17 is the present value of the hubble parameter , and a dot denotes a derivative with respect to time .",
    "the scale factor is chosen such that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 @xmath20 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 .",
    "if we take our position as the origin , @xmath22 , then the angular - diameter distance to an object at redshift @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , respectively , for open , flat , and closed geometries .",
    "for an einstein - de sitter universe , @xmath28 .",
    "the distance to the horizon is given by @xmath29 .",
    "we wish ultimately to derive an expression for the angular 3pcf of a distribution of tracer masses ( e.g. , galaxies , quasars , clusters , radio sources , etc . ) , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 represents two - dimensional coordinates on the sky , @xmath32/ \\overline{\\sigma}$ ] is the fractional perturbation to the unsmoothed tracer - mass density field , @xmath33 , and angular brackets denote an average over direction in the sky , with fixed values for the distances @xmath34 .",
    "though statistical homogeneity and isotropoy ensure that the 3pcf will only depend on the relative angular separations between the three points , measuring @xmath7 for all possible geometric configurations can nonetheless be a daunting task . for this reason",
    ", many studies have focussed instead on the normalized angular skewness , @xmath35 , obtained from the moments of counts in cells smoothed with an effective angular scale half - width @xmath8 ( it is implicitly assumed that @xmath36 , where @xmath3 is the number of discrete counts ) .",
    "this one - point statistic is more readily calculable than the full angular 3pcf , while still preserving information about the overall scale - dependence of @xmath7 .    in deriving the following results , we implicitly make use of the small - angle approximation in assuming that a small patch of sky can be treated using a fourier expansion ( peebles 1980 ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the component of the three - dimensional wave vector along the line of sight is taken to be negligible compared to the orthogonal components , so that the angular cfs depend only on the latter .",
    "we later comment on this assumption .",

    "we can then obtain the angular 2pcf , as measured using counts in cells , @xmath43 we define @xmath44 where the angular , or projected , power spectrum of the tracer mass , @xmath45 ( usually written in terms of @xmath46 s in papers on the cosmic microwave background ) , can be related to the full tracer - mass power spectrum , @xmath47 , by a fourier - space analog of limber s equation ( kaiser 1992 ) , @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is a @xmath50-space selection function for the tracer mass , normalized such that @xmath51 .    we assume the fractional perturbation to the _ unsmoothed _ three - dimensional tracer mass density field , @xmath52 ,",

    "the bracketed @xmath3-dependent terms in equation  ( [ s3 ] ) arise from the effects of smoothing the contiguous field , @xmath52 , defined in equation  ( [ dexp ] ) . in particular , since smoothing at a fixed physical mixes different mass scales , the higher - order moments for smoothed fields will generally contain additional terms reflecting the scale dependence of the rms fluctuation ( bernardeau 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "the @xmath113 case thus recovers the no - smoothing result for @xmath1 ( bernardeau 1995 ) , since the rms fluctuation in this case is independent of scale [ see equation  ( [ varpizero ] ) ] . though the filter is designed to separate out the nonlinear , small - scale fluctuations , an unbounded scale - free power spectrum with @xmath112 produces so much small - scale power that the fluctuations induced by smoothing over nonlinear scales become comparable to or greater than the large - scale linear perturbations , leading to the divergence in @xmath109 seen in the figure .",
    "equation  ( [ s3 ] ) differs from the known result for @xmath1 assuming constant , nonlinear bias ( bernardeau 1995 ) only in that it contains the @xmath109 term .",
    "the difference is attributable to the fact that previous authors usually define the bias parameters using the form of equation  ( [ dexp ] ) , but relating the _ smoothed _ , rather than the unsmoothed , observed and underlying density fields .",
    "such a definition is technically nonlocal , only fixing the linear- and nonlinear - bias parameters at the chosen smoothing scale . while it can be shown that the `` smoothed '' and `` unsmoothed '' linear - bias parameters are identical",

    "the two parameters are identical , as expected , but can differ dramatically on large scales ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "similar correction terms , arising from nonlinear bias , are expected for higher - order angular moments as well .",
    "such terms might be used to discriminate between the smoothed and unsmoothed bias pictures , and possibly distinguish between linear and nonlinear bias based on the skewness alone , as discussed in  2.2 and in bk99 . unless stated otherwise , it will be hereafter understood that `` bias '' shall refer to the unsmoothed bias prescription defined by equation  ( [ dexp ] ) .",
    "while the power spectrum for any viable cosmological model will not be given by a simple power law , it can be shown , using the results of bernardeau ( 1995 ) and gaztaaga & bernardeau ( 1998 ) , that an exact result for @xmath1 can be obtained for arbitrary power spectra , using a properly redefined _ effective _ index ( scoccimarro 1998 ) .",
    "this result , analogous to that in the spatial case ( bernardeau 1994 ) , is strictly valid , however , only for linear biasing , since it fails to account for the above - mentioned large - scale variation associated with @xmath56 . since we wish to consider nonlinear biasing , and because , unlike @xmath1 , no corresponding exact result can be obtained for the full angular 3pcf in the case of arbitrary power spectra , even for linear biasing , the results of this paper are based entirely on numerical integration of the appropriate equations .",

    "the scale - dependent cdm transfer function naturally induces a dependence on the smoothing scale , @xmath8 , and compared to equation  ( [ s3 ] ) , a more substantial dependence on the combination of cosmological parameters @xmath145 . yet , although the five cosmological models shown in the figure span a broad range of parameter values , @xmath146 , they yield fairly similar results , and are certainly all consistent within the limits of current observations ( see figure [ fig : s3_apm ] ) .",
    "the slight variation seen is mostly due to the dependence on @xmath147 ; there is little difference between the scdm and tcdm models , which differ only in the value of @xmath3 , and virtually no difference between the ocdm and @xmath141cdm models .",
    "if the analysis is restricted to the range @xmath148 , as suggested by current data ( bartlett 1998 ) , one can infer from the figure that the predicted values for @xmath1 for a survey such as the apm are relatively insensitive to the adopted cosmological model .",
    "figure [ fig : s3_k ] shows the results for @xmath6 for the same five cosmological models , assuming the high-@xmath23 sf .",
    "the primary dependence is again seen to be with @xmath147 , and while there is a somewhat greater spread between the different models , the differences between realistically viable models are still relatively small compared to those induced by the bias dependences which we explore in the next section .",
    "overall , we find that the high-@xmath23 sf curves for these models show greater variation of @xmath1 with @xmath8 than their apm sf counterparts . this is simply due to the fact that in a deeper angular survey , a fixed angle probes clustering over a broader range of physical scales , including very large scales , while conversely , in a shallower survey , a fixed angle is sensitive to clustering only over a relatively narrow range of smaller physical scales .",
    "thus , at larger values of @xmath8 , the high-@xmath23 result incorporates physically large scales and tends toward smaller values for @xmath1 .",
    "these can be roughly approximated using equation  ( [ s3 ] ) by @xmath149 \\approx   r_3(n_{k } ) \\times ( 9/14)$ ] , where @xmath150 , the value of the effective spectral index of the ( untilted ) linear - theory cdm power spectrum , tends towards unity at large scales ( recall that @xmath151 is of order unity and independent of @xmath8 ) .",
    "for the apm case , however , @xmath1 remains higher at larger @xmath8 , since even large angular scales in a shallower survey still correspond only to smaller physical scales , where the effective power - spectrum index is negative . at smaller @xmath8 ,",
    "both sets of curves tend toward the expected larger values of @xmath152 obtained with @xmath153the effective power - spectrum index at small scales ; for tilted models , @xmath1 tends toward a value @xmath154 smaller . note that in both figures , the semi - analytic results for a scale - free power spectrum with a canonical index value of @xmath144 ( thin , horizontal lines ) provide poor fits to the cdm predictions .",
    "other authors have investigated ql results for the normalized angular skewness using cdm models ( gaztaaga & frieman 1994 ; frieman & gaztaaga 1994 ; gaztaaga & baugh 1998 ; gaztaaga & bernardeau 1998 ) , and find similar results .",
    "the results of the previous section already allow for the existence of a constant , nonlinear bias between the tracer - mass and the underlying matter distributions , but can be generalized by allowing the bias parameters to evolve with time , as is suggested both by theory and observations ( fry 1996 ; peacock 1997 ; matarrese 1997 ; steidel 1998 ; cress & kamionkowski 1998 ; catelan 1998 ; taruya , koyama , & soda 1998 ; tegmark & peebles 1998 ; coln 1998 ; baugh 1998 ; magliocchetti & maddox 1998 ) . fry ( 1996 )",

    "we note that this model fails to account for merging , and can not produce an anti - bias ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "bk99 discuss a generalization of the fry model to the case of arbitrary expansion history .",
    "other , more general models have been proposed ( e.g. , tegmark & peebles 1998 ) , but we employ the generalized fry model as a first approximation to investigate the effects of bias evolution , and merely quote the relevant results below .",

    "note that we have now ignored the very weak dependence of the bispectrum on @xmath82 ; the dependence on the expansion history , i.e. , on the species contributing to the total energy density , is contained in the growth factor , @xmath63 .",
    "the result for @xmath1 can then be extended to the case of evolving bias by using the bispectrum of equation  ( [ bfe ] ) in equation  ( [ askewness ] ) , which amounts to making the substitutions @xmath160 inside the brackets in equation  ( [ askewness2 ] ) , and replacing @xmath55 by @xmath161 .    for the apm and high-@xmath23 sfs , respectively , figures [ fig : s3_a12_bias ] and [ fig : s3_k_bias ] display the results for @xmath6 in five different bias scenarios , each employing the scdm , @xmath141cdm , and ocdm models above : an unbiased scenario ( @xmath162 , @xmath163 , taken from figures [ fig : s3_a12 ] and [ fig : s3_k ] ) , a non - evolving , linear bias ( @xmath164 , @xmath163 ) , a non - evolving , nonlinear bias ( @xmath164 , @xmath165 ) , an evolving , linear bias ( @xmath166 , @xmath167 ) , and an evolving , nonlinear bias ( @xmath166 , @xmath168 ) . for the non - evolving bias scenarios , the @xmath141cdm and ocdm models are taken to be identical , as suggested by figures [ fig : s3_a12 ] and [ fig : s3_k ] , and therefore only the @xmath141cdm models are plotted in these cases .",
    "these two models do , however , differ slightly more in evolving bias scenarios , due to the different time dependences of their linear growth factors , and the differences between them would increase with decreasing @xmath15 . for",
    "the evolving cases we hereafter assume a formation redshift of @xmath169 .",
    "the qualitative dependences of @xmath1 on the bias scenario are similar to those of its spatial counterpart ( bk99 ) .",
    "specifically , it is clear from these figures that the dependence of the angular skewness on the biasing scheme can potentially be far more significant than that upon the cosmological parameters within a given scheme .",
    "for example , adding a very small linear bias to the low-@xmath147 models would yield a result very similar to the unbiased scdm predictions .",
    "generally , the presence of any significant linear bias , @xmath170 , tends to reduce the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath8 , as compared with the unbiased cases ( solid lines ) .",
    "furthermore , an observed @xmath1 curve which is far below the predicted unbiased result can only be achieved by a large linear bias term ( assuming @xmath171 ) , while one well above this value can only arise from the existence of a non - zero @xmath56 term or from anti - biasing ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "the curves for an evolving bias can produce less drastic shifts than their non - evolving counterparts , despite the fact that the respective bias terms are initially larger .",
    "this is because the evolution towards an unbiased state can effectively mimic a smaller ( especially at late times ) , constant bias , as demonstrated by bk99 .",
    "again we find that the apm curves in figure [ fig : s3_a12_bias ] are flatter than their high-@xmath23 counterparts in figure [ fig : s3_k_bias ] , for reasons explained in  2.1 .",
    "note also that models with nonlinear bias exhibit an upturn at large @xmath8 .",
    "the upturn arises from the contribution of the higher - order terms in the sum in equation  ( [ askewness2 ] ) , which , in the presence of a non - zero @xmath56 term , can become significant on large scales , where the effective power - spectrum index becomes positive ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "bk99 perform the analogous three - dimensional calculation and find similar large - scale behavior of the normalized spatial skewness , @xmath173 .",
    "depending on the cosmological model , this transition here occurs at angular scales of about a few degrees for the apm sf , and slightly higher values in the case of the high-@xmath23 sf .",
    "thus , the scdm model , whose power spectrum peaks at larger wavenumber than those of the low-@xmath147 models , will exhibit the upturn at smaller values of @xmath8 , while the low-@xmath147 models with nonlinear bias are expected to show an upturn only at larger angular scales , where they begin to sample positively - sloped regions of the power spectrum .",
    "however , unlike the case for @xmath173 ( bk99 ) , the exact location and severity of this upturn in @xmath1 for the different cosmological models is influenced not only by the shape of the power spectrum , but also by the weightings arising from the sf ( see figure [ fig : dndz ] ) and from the terms proportional to powers of @xmath50 in equations  ( [ askewness2 ] ) and ( [ varpizero ] ) .",
    "for example , the apm sf , which resembles a low-@xmath50 spike , exacerbates the upturn by effectively sampling the @xmath50 integrals only around the low peak value of @xmath174 , where the @xmath175 factor is extremely large . in the case of the high-@xmath23",
    "sf , while large values of @xmath8 still sample a positively - sloped region of @xmath176 , the sf itself , which is everywhere much shallower than in the apm case , is effectively zero where the @xmath175 factor is large , and peaks at a high value of @xmath50 , where this factor is very small .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : s3_k_bias ] , this behavior tends to lend less support to the divergence of the sum in equation  ( [ askewness2 ] ) at these scales , even in the case of a large , constant value of @xmath56 .",
    "note that for both sfs , the non - evolving , nonlinear cases exhibit more of an upturn , since in these cases the large value of @xmath56 is maintained for all time , whereas in the evolving cases , the divergence is less severe due to the fact that the tracer population evolves towards an unbiased state with time .",
    "the upturn in @xmath1 at large @xmath8 in nonlinear - bias models differs from the decreasing behavior expected if the higher - order terms in the sum in equation  ( [ askewness2 ] ) are neglected , i.e. , if the bias parameters , as defined for _ smoothed _ density fields in equation  ( [ dexp ] ) , are are assumed to be constant , as in peak - biasing or halo - biasing models ( mo & white 1996 ) .",
    "bk99 show in the case of the normalized spatial skewness that this different large - scale behavior might be used to obtain better constraints on @xmath55 and @xmath56 on the basis of skewness measurements alone , since combinations of linear and nonlinear bias which yield effectively degenerate results for @xmath173 on smaller smoothing scales , can , at least in principle , be distinguished by considering smoothing scales where the relevant _ effective _ index ( bernardeau 1994 ) is positive , i.e. , scales greater than @xmath177 @xmath178 mpc in typical cdm models ( see figures 2 and 5 in bk99 and related discussions ) . similarly , we can infer from figures [ fig : s3_a12_bias ] and [ fig : s3_k_bias ] that combinations of these parameters which are degenerate at small @xmath8 become more distinct at large @xmath8 ( due to the upturn ) , and that comparing ql pt predictions with large - scale measurements ( @xmath179 ) of @xmath1 might also resolve this degeneracy . if this large - scale behavior is not seen , this would argue in favor of smoothed - bias prescriptions , rather than the unsmoothed formulation we employ . at such scales , however , one might be limited by the variance induced from the smaller number of independently sampled cells ( seto & yokoyama 1998 ) , and may require a more accurate derivation which does not assume the small - angle approximation , but instead employs a full spherical harmonic decomposition ( verde 1999 ) .    figures [ fig : s3_a12_bias ] and [ fig : s3_k_bias ] also provide illustrations of one of the potential degeneracies that can arise when considering the normalized skewness .",
    "it is known that the one - point statistics @xmath173 and @xmath1 can be nearly degenerate with respect to combinations of cosmological and biasing models , with respect to constant @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( barring large - scale measurements , as mentioned above ) , and also with respect to evolving vs. non - evolving bias models ( bk99 ) .",
    "this latter degeneracy is illustrated in figure [ fig : s3_a12_bias ] by the almost identical predictions of the ocdm model with evolving , linear bias and the ocdm/@xmath141cdm model with constant , linear bias , and in figure [ fig : s3_k_bias ] by the similarity between the scdm models with constant , linear bias and with evolving , linear bias .",
    "it would clearly be impossible to distinguish between such similar predictions given present data of the type shown in figure [ fig : s3_apm ] .",
    "as an example of what can be learned from current measurements , we compare in figure [ fig : s3_apm ] our predictions for @xmath1 using the apm sf with data from the apm galaxy survey , containing over @xmath180 galaxies ( see gaztaaga 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "the data points ( gaztaaga 1997 ) are not corrected for the effects of source fragmentation , and the error bars shown are derived from the scatter in four sub - zones , plus shot - noise corrections , and are thus extremely conservative , especially at large @xmath8 .",
    "the curves plotted are for the scdm and @xmath141cdm models , with `` best - fit '' values for @xmath55 of 1.14 and 1.22 , respectively ( assuming only constant , linear biasing ) .",
    "it should be noted that discrepancies between the data and our ql pt predictions are expected at small scales , due to : 1 ) shot - noise fluctuations arising from the discreteness of the observed distribution [ i.e. , the @xmath181 are no longer reliable estimators of the area - averaged cfs ( peebles 1980 ; gaztaaga 1994 , 1997 ) ] , 2 ) estimation biases arising from the fact that the ratio of two unbiased estimators is not itself an unbiased estimator ( hui & gaztaaga 1998 ) , and 3 ) nonlinear effects not accounted for in our models ( boucher , schaeffer , & davis 1991 ; jain & bertschinger 1994 ; scoccimarro 1998 ; scoccimarro & frieman 1998 ; munshi & melott 1998 ) . at large scales",
    "we expect discrepancies to arise from the breakdown of the small - angle approximation and the large scatter in the data induced by the smaller number of independently sampled cells .",
    "if we therefore exclude the data points at both the lower and upper ends of the range of @xmath8 , and restrict the comparison to ql scales of @xmath182 , where our predictions are expected to be valid , we find reasonable agreement with plausible cdm models having a small amount of linear bias .",
    "of course , this conclusion is merely qualitative , as these data are clearly unable to place tight constraints on the models .",
    "the 2-@xmath183 error on @xmath55 in both models is roughly @xmath184 , depending on exactly which points are excluded , in agreement with previous determinations of @xmath185 for the apm survey ( baugh & efstathiou 1993 ; gaztaaga 1994 ; bernardeau 1995 ) .",
    "that the data for optically selected galaxies are roughly fit in the ql regime by the predicted values of @xmath1 in cdm models , requiring little or no bias ( gaztaaga 1994 ; bernardeau 1995 ; cappi & maurogordato 1995 ; roche & eales 1998 ; magliocchetti 1998 ) , lends some support to the scenario of gravitational evolution ensuing from gaussian initial conditions , but better data are clearly needed . note that the thin solid line , derived from equation  ( [ s3 ] ) with the apm sf , no bias , and a constant power - law index of @xmath144 , yields a poorer fit in the ql range",
    "the normalized angular skewness , while containing some information about the overall dependence of clustering strength with scale , discards detailed and valuable information about the configuration dependence which is contained in the full angular 3pcf .",
    "it is known that the shape dependence of the spatial bispectrum and 3pcf , in leading order pt , can be used to distinguish between the effects of gravitational clustering and bias , as well as to obtain independent constraints on the linear- and nonlinear - bias parameters and on cosmological parameters ( jing & zhang 1989 ; fry 1994 ; fry 1996 ; jing & brner 1997 ; matarrese , verde , & heavens 1997 ; bk99 ) .",
    "it stands to reason that the full angular 3pcf should also break these degeneracies and yield similar constraints . with this in mind , many authors have investigated the normalized angular 3pcf , @xmath186 where the angular distances @xmath187 form a triangle on the sky .",
    "this quantity , which like @xmath1 is independent of the amplitude of the power spectrum , was introduced based on empirical arguments for the so - called hierarchical model ( peebles 1975 ; peebles & groth 1975 ; peebles 1980 ) , and motivated by data which appeared to indicate that @xmath0 was simply a constant .",
    "while equation  ( [ qdef ] ) may be taken as a definition , the result for @xmath0 in ql pt is , in general , _ not _ merely a constant ; we demonstrate that the apparent constancy of @xmath0 , as measured from past data , may simply be an artifact of coarse averaging over configuration shapes ( peebles & groth 1975 ; fry & seldner 1982 ) , combined with the effects of the shallow sfs which have characterized past surveys .",
    "there are , however , other problems associated with the definition of the normalized angular 3pcf in equation  ( [ qdef ] ) . in particular , @xmath0 is apt to exhibit rapid variation and divergence where the denominator in equation  ( [ qdef ] ) happens to acquire values of or near zero .",
    "this behavior is artificial in the sense that it does not reflect the true behavior of the 3pcf itself . bk99",
    "demonstrate the analogous problems associated with the definition of the normalized spatial 3pcf , @xmath188 , and speculate that practical limitations in measuring this behavior may , in part , be responsible for observed discrepancies between ql pt predictions and those of @xmath95-body simulations .",
    "the skewness is less susceptible to this problem since it is scaled by the square of the variance , a positive - definite quantity . in places where @xmath0 exhibits this rapidly - varying or divergent behavior ,",
    "we will instead consider @xmath189 , defined as @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the rms angular fluctuation on a smoothing scale of @xmath98 , obtained for each model using equation  ( [ varpizero ] ) .",

    "even once their different normalizations have been accounted for , we find that the high-@xmath23 curves have significantly lower amplitudes than their apm - sf counterparts in the left panels .",
    "this is simply because projected triangles in a deeper survey can correspond to much larger physical triangles , for which the clustering amplitude will be significantly smaller .",
    "since @xmath189 is normalized by the square of the variance at a fixed scale , these plots now reveal clearly the expected decrease in clustering strength with increasing scale ; this behavior , however , is not described simply by the @xmath245 prediction of the hierarchical model . unlike the apm case , we now find that _ all _ models show a significant variation with shape , as well as scale , with the low-@xmath147 models in some cases now showing the strongest shape dependence .",
    "the scdm and tcdm models appear less differentiated than in the apm case , but we find that the @xmath141cdm and ocdm models can now differ somewhat more substantially , particularly on larger scales , since deeper surveys are more sensitive to cosmological effects .",
    "most importantly , however , we still find overall that the high-@xmath147 and low-@xmath147 models can be fairly well resolved on @xmath246 scales , and the distinction increases for larger scales .",
    "naturally , a thorough comparison with measurements spanning the full configuration space in a more complete fashion would allow for better discrimination among models .",
    "the results for the different bias scenarios investigated in  2.2 are demonstrated in figure [ fig : z_bias ] , which shows @xmath189 , assuming @xmath247 and @xmath222 , for the @xmath141cdm ( thick lines ) and ocdm ( thin lines ) models , for the high-@xmath23 sf . though this is only one slice of the parameter space we are exploring , we use it to illustrate the similar dependences of the full angular 3pcf on the bias scheme as were seen for @xmath1 . in particular , we see a general flattening and reduction of @xmath189 with increasing linear bias , and a relative increase with increasing nonlinear bias , as compared with the corresponding linear scheme .",
    "note the slightly different predictions between these two models , arising from their different expansion histories ; these differences would be greater for lower values of @xmath15 . as with @xmath1 ( see figures [ fig : s3_a12_bias ] and [ fig : s3_k_bias ] ) , it is clear that measurements of @xmath189 should be able distinguish between the effects of a significant bias and those arising simply from unbiased gravitational evolution .",
    "consideration of the full configuration dependence of the angular 3pcf , however , allows for much better discrimination between different cosmological and biasing schemes than could be obtained from the skewness alone .",
    "it is known that measurements of the bispectrum and 3pcf can be used to obtain independent constraints on the constant - valued linear- and nonlinear - bias parameters ( fry & gaztaaga 1993 ; fry 1994 , 1996 ; jing 1997 ; matarrese , verde , & heavens 1997 , bk99 ) .",
    "this can be inferred here from the different manners in which @xmath55 and @xmath56 appear in equation  ( [ z ] ) ; the different weightings of these two parameters is sampled for every triangular configuration , producing a graph such as figure [ fig : z_bias ] for every pair of values @xmath248 [ as opposed to @xmath1 , which yields only one constraint on the combination of @xmath249 and @xmath250 . as another example of the added information which can be gleaned from the full geometric dependence of the full 3pcf , we plot in figure [ fig:2dfull_bias_deg ] @xmath251 , assuming the high-@xmath23 sf , for two of our bias scenarios : the scdm constant , linear - bias model ( with @xmath164 and @xmath252 ) , and the scdm evolving linear - bias model ( with @xmath166 and @xmath253 ) .",
    "these two cases yielded nearly identical results for @xmath1 in figure [ fig : s3_k_bias ] ( where evolving , linear bias effectively approximated a smaller , constant , linear bias ) , particularly on scales near @xmath98 . here , we see that by considering the variation of @xmath189 with triangle geometry , the degeneracy between constant and evolving bias can be alleviated , to a degree , because the angular 3pcf probes a broad range of redshifts and allows us to see the effects of evolution in projection . bk99 show that these evolving and non - evolving bias models might also be distinguished using measurements of @xmath254 as a function of redshift in a deep ( @xmath255 ) survey , or , to a lesser extent , by large - scale ( @xmath256 mpc ) measurements of @xmath254 at @xmath12 . in practice , however , measuring the angular 3pcf over scales of @xmath257 in a deep optical survey , or a radio survey such as the vla first survey , may be more feasible and would likely yield stronger statistical constraints .",
    "the parameter values we have investigated here are only intended as illustrations . the full statistical power which could be gained by exploring both the configuration and evolutionary dependences of @xmath7 in a complete fashion could be useful in distinguishing between the signatures of gravitational evolution versus bias , independently measuring the linear- and nonlinear - bias parameters , and constraining the shape of the power spectrum . with better data , as might be obtained from emerging surveys , one could further determine the linear evolution of the power spectrum and of the bias , which in turn provide direct constraints on @xmath15 , @xmath258 , and possibly the epoch of galaxy formation",
    ". however , it is already clear from figures [ fig:2d][fig:2dfull_bias_deg ] that the behavior of the angular 3pcf is not simply that of the hierarchical model which assumes @xmath0 to be a shape - independent constant , and further that , in addition to the full geometric dependence , one must consider the detailed dependences on the forms and evolutionary behaviors of the power spectrum , the biasing mechanism , and the selection function , as these can have a substantial impact on the results , particularly for high - redshift surveys .",
    "we have calculated the leading - order results for the normalized angular skewness and 3pcf , assuming gaussian initial conditions , for an arbitrary , biased tracer - mass distribution in flat and open universes .",
    "we have considered two selection functions , intended to represent low - redshift ( @xmath121 ) and high - redshift ( @xmath259 ) surveys .",
    "our derivations incorporate such features as the scale dependence and linear evolution of the cdm power spectrum and the presence of a possibly evolving linear or nonlinear bias .",
    "our results for @xmath1 for the case of an unbiased tracer mass are in agreement with previous work ( fry & gaztaaga 1993 ; bernardeau 1995 ) and we confirm that pt predictions for @xmath1 in typical cdm models , with a small amount of linear biasing ( @xmath260 ) , agree in the ql regime with data from the apm galaxy survey .",
    "similar to bk99 , we extend the result for @xmath1 in the case of nonlinear bias , to include a scale - dependent , leading - order correction which becomes significant for positive effective spectral indices , corresponding to scales @xmath179 for cdm models .",
    "this correction term can be used to relate the unsmoothed nonlinear - bias parameter defined in the limit of continuous fields , with the traditionally - used , scale - dependent , nonlinear - bias parameter defined for smoothed density fields . for a given cdm model , this large - scale behavior of @xmath1 might alone allow a more accurate determination of the linear- and nonlinear - bias parameters ( or at least discriminate between the smoothed and unsmoothed bias formulations ) , if other factors , such as sampling variance and the breakdown of the small - angle approximation , can be addressed .",
    "we also derive predictions for the normalized angular 3pcf , considering @xmath189 rather than @xmath0 in cases where the latter is ill - behaved .",
    "we show that @xmath7 , as predicted by ql pt , is not given simply by the form of the `` empirical '' hierarchical model , i.e. , with @xmath0 simply a constant of order unity , but has a more complex dependence on scale , shape , and expansion history . while for shallow sfs the weak shape dependence of @xmath0 , combined with measurements coarsely averaged over configuration shapes , can yield results consistent with this hierarchical model , ignoring the detailed geometric and evolutionary variations of the angular 3pcf in general can destroy much valuable information . in several cases ,",
    "we illustrate explicitly the importance of the various evolutionary dependences which factor into our calculations of angular statistics , such as the linear evolution of the power spectrum , the evolution of the bias parameters , and the @xmath15 dependence of the sfs .",
    "the proper treatment of these detailed dependences will be important in interpreting data from the emerging generation of deep , high - precision surveys , particularly when considering the high - redshift universe .",
    "we find that biasing plays a major role in predictions for @xmath1 and @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , the scale dependence of @xmath1 and the configuration dependence of @xmath0 ( or @xmath189 ) bear characteristic imprints of bias , such as a relative flattening and decrease with increasing @xmath55 and a relative increase with increasing @xmath56 . compared with the dependence on the biasing scenario ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath1 on the cosmological model is fairly weak .",
    "this is not the case , however , for @xmath0 , which can vary appreciably with the values of @xmath147 and @xmath3 . though @xmath1 preserves information about the overall scale dependence of the 3pcf , it provides only one constraint on the combination of the cosmological parameters , @xmath249 , and @xmath261 , leaving various possible degeneracies between these quantities , including the degeneracy between constant- and evolving - bias models .",
    "these can be partially alleviated by considering the dependence of the normalized angular 3pcf on the projected - triangle geometry .",
    "in particular , the variation of @xmath0 can be used to distinguish between the effects of gravitational evolution and bias , place constraints on the value of @xmath147 and the shape of the power spectrum , measure the bias terms @xmath55 and @xmath56 and their time evolution , and perhaps constrain @xmath15 directly . comparing predictions for @xmath1 and @xmath0 with several data sets characterizing different tracer populations could allow multiple , complementary constraints on these important quantities .    while many of the results obtained here for @xmath1 and @xmath7 are qualitatively similar to the corresponding results obtained by bk99 for their spatial counterparts , @xmath173 and @xmath254 , the use of angular statistics offers many practical advantages , such as greater statistical power and the absence of redshift distortions , which warrant their separate consideration .",
    "our derivations have also relied on specific assumptions , such as the chosen bias - evolution model and the validity of both the small - angle approximation and the assumption of quasilinearity .",
    "based on analogous results from three - dimensional calculations , we expect that qualitative features such as the upturn in @xmath1 at large smoothing angles in the case of nonlinear bias , the reduced configuration ( scale ) dependence of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) with increasing linear bias of any form , and the sensitivity of @xmath0 to the shape of the power spectrum will be retained in more general calculations .",
    "the utility of the predictions for @xmath1 and @xmath0 will of course rely on the precision with which these statistics can be measured .",
    "while current data , of the type shown in figure [ fig : s3_apm ] , is clearly insufficient to obtain strong constraints on the shape of the power spectrum or on the bias parameters , it is hoped that future surveys , such as the sdss , will greatly improve upon this situation .",
    "in particular , if we optimistically assume the relevant uncertainties to be predominantly statistical , we can infer that the errors in measurements of @xmath1 from the sdss will be roughly a factor of ten smaller than those in figure [ fig : s3_apm ] .",
    "of course , the comparison of predictions with two - dimensional survey data will require the additional consideration of systematic effects . among these",
    "are finite - volume and boundary effects , which can have a significant impact on degree scales and above ( baugh , gaztaaga , & efstathiou 1995 ; szapudi & colombi 1996 ; colombi , szapudi , & szalay 1998 ; gaztaaga & bernardeau 1998 ; munshi & melott 1998 ) , estimation biases ( hui & gaztaaga 1998 ; kerscher 1998 ) , poisson noise ( peebles 1980 ; gaztaaga 1994 ) , and sampling variance ( seto & yokoyama 1998 ) .",
    "gaztaaga & bernardeau ( 1998 ) also find that ql pt predictions for angular statistics may underestimate projection effects , particularly for apm - type surveys .",
    "in addition , the above calculations can be extended in several ways .",
    "for example , one might consider stochastic - biasing models which may yield different results , particularly on smaller scales ( fry & gaztaaga 1993 ; catelan 1998 ; catelan , matarrese , & porciani 1998 ; taruya , koyama & soda 1998 ; blanton 1998 ; coln 1998 ; taruya & soda 1998 ; narayanan , berlind , & weinberg 1998 ) .",
    "several authors have also investigated the impact of higher - order nonlinear terms in pt calculations ( jain & bertschinger 1994 ; scoccimarro & frieman 1996a , b ; scoccimarro 1998 ; heavens , matarrese , & verde 1998 ; scoccimarro & frieman 1998 ) , also expected to become important on smaller scales , where @xmath262 .",
    "similar calculations can also be performed for higher - order angular moments and @xmath3-point cfs , such as the kurtosis and four - point correlation function , and so on ( suto & matsubara 1994 ; bernardeau 1994 ; lokas 1995 ; gaztaaga & bernardeau 1998 ) , which , in principle , provide additional , independent constraints .",
    "the formalism can also be applied to structure - formation models with non - gaussian initial conditions , such as topological - defect or isocurvature models , to investigate how these might be distinguished from inflationary models ( luo & schramm 1993 ; jaffe 1994 ; fry & scherrer 1994 ; chodorowski & bouchet 1996 ; white 1998 ) .",
    "we are indebted to j. frieman and e. gaztaaga for helpful discussions and suggestions , and in particular for their help in clarifying an earlier problem in the calculation .",
    "we also wish to thank r. scoccimarro , as well as licia verde , for numerous helpful comments and discussions .",

    "in this appendix , we derive a simple fourier - space analogue of limber s equation for the bispectrum of the two - dimensional projection of a three - dimensional scalar field .",
    "our derivation is similar to that of kaiser ( 1992 ) , who calculated the projected ( two - point ) power spectrum .",

    "we consider only small patches , and thus can perform a two - dimensional fourier transform on essentially flat areas of sky , giving @xmath269 , where @xmath270 denotes two - dimensional fourier - space vectors . as in kaiser",
    "( 1992 ) , the contribution from a thin shell of width @xmath271 centered at @xmath272 to @xmath269 is @xmath273 where the @xmath274 factor arises from the integral of @xmath275 over the shell .",
    "we define the three - dimensional bispectrum , the fourier - space analogue of the three - point function , by @xmath276 the two - dimensional analogue is @xmath277 where the dimensionality of the dirac delta function is obvious from its arguments .",

    "thus , we can sum up the contributions from different shells , and convert the sum to an integral : @xmath287 with the full definition of the bispectrum , this just gives the desired formula , @xmath288 ( allowing the three - dimensional bispectrum to vary with lookback time , @xmath50 ) .",
    "note that the integrand in the formula is weighted by @xmath289 ; this is in contrast to the ( two - point ) power spectrum version of the calculation which weights by @xmath290 [ see equation  ( [ pp2 ] ) ] .",
    "hence , the bispectrum is weighted considerably more heavily to late times ( small @xmath50 ) .    to generalize to an open or closed universe",
    ", we must replace the distances @xmath50 in the derivation above with the angular - diameter distance .",
