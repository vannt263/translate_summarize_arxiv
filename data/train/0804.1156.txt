    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been confirmed to a great accuracy in many experiments . despite the fact that the higgs particle remains experimentally elusive , few scientists doubt that there will be major surprises in this direction .",
    "the whole scientific community , however , knows that the sm needs to be improved .",
    "first of all , neutrino oscillation experiments have exhibited the evidence for ( tiny ) neutrino masses , that have to be incorporated in ( an extension of ) the sm .",
    "many ideas exist on how this can be achieved and more experimental precision tests will indicate which models are viable .",
    "second , there are also several theoretical issues that make physicists believe that the sm is only an effective manifestation of a more fundamental theory .    in approximately one year",
    ", the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will start to operate at energies of order of 14 tev in the center of mass .",
    "apart from the search for the higgs boson , it will probably give us some answers about the parameter space of the physics beyond the sm . among the many issues that will be addressed",
    ", it is worth to mention : the search for supersymmetry , heavy quarks and the quark - gluon plasma , the existence of extra dimensions and the possible creation of tiny black holes .",
    "one of the most attractive scenario for physics beyond the sm is the existence of additional massive neutral gauge bosons @xcite-@xcite .",
    "they could be one of the first discoveries at lhc if their mass is in the range of a few tev .",
    "many different models have been developed in the past in order to investigate this possibility .",
    "the mass could be acquired in a variety of ways : from kaluza - klein modes to a standard higgs mechanism or even by adding an axionic field , @xmath4 , which couples to the abelian factors ( stckelberg mechanism ) @xcite .",
    "the latter is common to low energy effective field theories which appear anomalous .",
    "the anomaly cancellation is achieved by the green - schwarz mechanism with stckelberg terms accompanied by axion like couplings , @xmath5 , which ensure the consistency of these models @xcite .",
    "for example , in string theory anomalous @xmath0 s are very common .",
    "d - brane models contain several abelian factors , living on each stack of branes , and they are typically anomalous @xcite-@xcite . in the presence of these anomalous @xmath0",
    "s , the stckelberg mixing with the axions cancels mixed anomalies @xcite , and renders the  anomalous \" gauge fields massive .",
    "the masses depend non - trivially on the internal volumes and on other moduli , allowing the physical masses of the anomalous @xmath0 gauge bosons to be much smaller than the string scale ( even at a few tev range ) @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that axionic terms alone are not sufficient to cancel all anomalies .",
    "an important role is played by the so - called generalized chern - simons terms ( gcs ) which are local gauge non - invariant terms . indeed",
    ", these trilinear gauge bosons anomalous couplings are responsible for the cancellation of mixed anomalies between anomalous @xmath6s and non anomalous factors ensuring the consistency of the theory @xcite-@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in _ anomaly related _ @xmath7 bosons in a non - renormalizable effective field theory . more precisely , we study an extension of the mssm ( see @xcite for a review ) by the addition of an abelian vector multiplet @xmath8 and we assume that generically all mssm particles are charged with respect to the new @xmath0 . in order to gain in flexibility , our model is only string inspired : we do not commit to a specific brane model and this is why the charges are not fixed , even if the effective cut - off is related to the mass of the @xmath7 .",
    "the extra vector multiplet generically is anomalous and consistency of the model requires an additional stckelberg multiplet @xmath9 with the proper couplings as well as gcs terms . as a consequence ,",
    "the anomalous abelian boson becomes massive and behaves like a @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , in order to break supersymmetry , we add the usual soft breaking terms and the new terms coming from the fermionic sectors of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "our model contains many new features : new d and f terms ( which are coming from the axionic terms and not from the gcs , in accordance with @xcite , due to the fact that the gcs s contain only vector multiplets in antisymmetric form ) , new couplings and new mass contributions in comparison with the mssm . explicit formulae are provide for all these terms in component fields .",
    "since the higgs fields might be charged under the anomalous @xmath0 , a combination of the stckelberg and the higgs mechanism makes the anomalous @xmath0 massive .",
    "an axi - goldstone combination is eaten by the neutral gauge bosons and no physical axi - higgs is left contrary to other studies on anomaly related @xmath7 @xcite and similarly to the case of a non - anomalous related @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we explicitly show how the anomaly cancellation mechanism works in our model before and after breaking the gauge symmetry . before gauge symmetry breaking , only sm fermions contribute to the triangle diagrams .",
    "after gauge symmetry breaking , all fermions that become massive still contribute to the anomalous triangle diagrams .",
    "their contribution is cancelled by new diagrams which involve the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson exchange .    in order to explore some phenomenological implications of our setting",
    ", we then analyze the decays @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we numerically compute the decay rates as functions of the arbitrary @xmath0 charges and the mass of the anomalous @xmath0 gauge boson .",
    "we find a non - trivial dependence on all these parameters , estimating that the region that gives the largest values is for @xmath12 tev , where the decay rate @xmath10 is of the order of @xmath13 gev .",
    "these decays are part of the processes in which two colliding protons lead to a four lepton final state @xcite .",
    "the final state is very clean and possibly measurable at lhc . assuming a degenerate mass spectrum for the sfermions of about 500 gev we also estimate @xmath14 , the expected number of @xmath7 produced per year .",
    "we find that @xmath14 falls off exponentially with @xmath15 , so we shall focus on the case @xmath16 tev and the most favorite decay @xmath2 .",
    "we also estimate the number of decays for 1 year of integrated luminosity which turns out to be @xmath17 in the most favourite region of parameters . in a future work",
    "we will push our program forward and study this signal with the aid of monte carlo methods @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ setup ] , we introduce the vector multiplet , @xmath8 , the stckelberg multiplet and we provide the axionic and gcs lagrangians in superfields and in components .",
    "we then discuss the anomaly cancellation both in the unbroken and in the broken phase . at the end of the section",
    ", we add all possible soft - breaking terms . in section",
    "[ consequences ] , we describe the model set up . in particular , we discuss the kinetic mixing terms which are coming from the axionic lagrangian and the d and f terms , pointing out explicitly the new contributions .",
    "we comment on the superpotential and we compute the mass terms for all the particles , pointing out the differences from the canonical mssm setup .",
    "finally , in section [ decays ] , we study some phenomenomogical implications of our model .",
    "we consider the case in which the higgs fields are uncharged with respect to the @xmath6 and compute the decay rates for the two processes @xmath18 and @xmath19 which should be relevant for the computation of hadron annihilations into four leptons . in the appendices we report the technical details and discuss the general case in which also the higgs fields transform under the anomalous @xmath6 .",
    "in this section , we discuss how to extend the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) to accommodate an additional abelian vector multiplet @xmath8 and how to cancel the anomalies with the green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "we assume that all the mssm fields are charged under the additional vector multiplet @xmath8 , with charges that are given in table  [ qtable ] , where @xmath20 are the left handed quarks and leptons respectively while @xmath21 are the right handed up and down quarks and the electrically charged leptons .",

    "we compute all the relevant diagrams in the @xmath32 gauge , thus removing the interaction vertex @xmath33 that involves the massive gauge bosons and the stckelberg or ng boson .",

    "<S> the advantage of this choice over the standard one is that it allows for arbitrary values of the quantum numbers of the extra @xmath0 . as a first step towards the study of hadron annihilations producing four leptons in the final state ( a clean signal which might be studied at lhc ) </S>",
    "<S> we then compute the decays @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the largest values of the decay rate is @xmath3 gev , while the expected number of events per year at lhc is at most of the order of 10 .    </S>",
