    "today there are no doubts left that the dynamical mechanisms of quark confinement [ 1 ] and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) [ 2 , 3 ] are closely related to the complicated topological structure of the qcd nonperturbative vacuum . for this reason any correct nonperturbative model of quark confinement and dcsb necessary becomes a model of a true qcd vacuum and vice versa .",
    "also , it becomes clear that nonperturbative infrared ( ir ) divergenses are closely related to the above mentioned nontrivial vacuum structure , play an important role in the large scale behaviour of qcd [ 4 - 6 ] .",
    "if it is true that qcd is an ir unstable theory ( i.e. , if has no ir stable fixed point ) then the low - frequency modes of the yang - mills fields should be enhanced due to nonperturbative ir divergences .",
    "so the full gluon propagator can diverge faster than the free one at small momentum , in accordance with [ 7 - 10 ] @xmath0 which describes the zero modes enhancement ( zme ) effect in qcd . if , indeed the low - frequency components of the virtual fields in the true vacuum have a larger amplitude than those of the bare ( perturbative ) vacuum [ 5 ] , then the green s function for a single quark should be reconstructed on the basis of this effect .",
    "it is important to understand that a possible effect of the zme ( 1.1 ) is our primary dynamical assumption .",
    "we will consider this effect as a rather realistic confining ansatz for the full gluon propagator in order to use it as input information for the quark sd equation .",
    "let us consider the exact , unrenormalized sd equation for the quark propagator in momentum space ( fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the eigenvalue of the quadratic casimir operator in the fundamental representation .",
    "since the notions are obvious , let us only note that our parametrization of the full quark propagator is as follows @xmath3 the full gluon propagator in the arbitrary covariant gauge is @xmath4 { 1\\over { q^2 } } d(-q^2 ,   a ) + a { { q_\\mu q_\\nu}\\over { q^4 } } \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a gauge fixing parameter ( @xmath6 for landau gauge ) .",
    "assuming that in the ir region @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the appropriate mass scale parameter , we obtain the above mentioned generally accepted form of the ir singular asymptotics for the full gluon propagator ( 1.1 ) [ 4 , 5 , 7 - 10 ] ( enhancement of the zero modes ) .    in order to actually define an initial sd equation ( 1.2 ) in the ir region ( at small momenta )",
    "let us apply the gauge - invariant dimensional regularization method of t hooft and veltman [ 11 ] in the limit @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a small ir regulation parameter , which is to be set to zero at the end of the computation @xmath11 .",
    "because of this the quark propagator and other green s functions become dependent , in general , on this ir regulation parameter @xmath10 .",
    "we consider the sd equations and the corresponding quark - gluon st identity in euclidean space ( @xmath12 but for simplicity the euclidean subscript will be omitted ) .",
    "let us use , in the sense of the distribution theory , the relation [ 12 ] @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a functional acting on the main ( test ) functions according to the so - called `` plus prescription '' standard formulae [ 12 ] .",
    "substituting ( 1.4 - 1.6 ) into the quark sd equation ( 1.2 ) on account of the above mentioned `` plus prescription '' formulae and expanding in powers of @xmath15 and keeping the terms of order @xmath16 ( the coulomb order terms ) , in agreement with ( 1.5 ) , one finally arrives at the quark propagator expansion in the ir region for unrenormalized quantities [ 13 ] ( in four - dimensional euclidean space ) .    as mentioned above ,",
    "all green s functions become dependent generally on the ir regularization parameter @xmath10 . in order to extract the finite green s functions in the ir region ,",
    "we introduce the renormalized ( ir finite ) quark - gluon vertex function at zero momentum transfer and the quark propagator as follows @xmath17 and @xmath18 at @xmath19 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath20 are the corresponding ir renormalization constants .",
    "the @xmath10-parameter dependence is indicated explicitly to distinguish them from the usual uv renormalization constants . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the renormalized ( ir finite ) green s functions and therefore do not depend on @xmath10 in the @xmath23 limit , i.e. they exist as @xmath23 .",
    "the correct treatment of such strong singularity ( 1.6 ) within distribution theory [ 12 ] enabled us to extract the required class of test functions in the renormalized quark sd equation .",
    "the test functions do consist of the quark propagator and the corresponding quark - gluon vertex function . by the renormalization program we have found the regular ( at zero point ) solutions for the quark propagator ( see below ) .",
    "for that very reason relation ( 1.6 ) is justified , it is multiplied by the appropriate smooth test functions . due to a quark convergence condition",
    ", a cancellation of nonperturbative ir divergences takes place .",
    "because of this condition the explicitly gauge - dependent terms ( the so - called next - to - leading terms ) in the above mentioned quark propagator expansion become @xmath10 - order terms . for this reason these noninvariant terms vanish in the @xmath24 limit [ 13 ] .    absolutely in the same way",
    "should be reconstructed the ghost self - energy and the corresponding st identity for the quark - gluon vertex [ 13 ] .",
    "we develop a method for the extraction of the ir - finite green s functions in qcd which means that they do not depend on the ir regulation parameter @xmath10 as @xmath11 . for this purpose",
    "we have worked out a renormalization program in order to cancel all the ir nonperturbative divergences which makes it possible to obtain a close set of the sd equations and the corresponding st identity in the quark sector . by completing our renormalization program ,",
    "we explicitly show that only multiplication by the quark ir renormalization constant will remove all nonperturbative ir divergences from the theory on a general ground .",
    "we have shown [ 13 ] that for the covariant gauges the complications due to ghost contributions can be considerable in our approach .",
    "the closed set of equations , obtained in our paper [ 13 ] , which will be used for numerical calculation of basic chiral qcd parameters as well as the vacuum energy density , should read @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the free quark propagator .",
    "the finite at zero point the ghost self - energy is denoted by @xmath28 and @xmath29 includes the mass scale parameter @xmath30 , determining the validity of the above mentioned deep ir singular asymptotic behaviour of the full gluon propagator ( 1.5 ) .",
    "let us mention that the ir finite quark renormalization constant , explicitly not shown here , which should multiply the free quark propagator in eq .",
    "( 1.7 ) is to be set to unity without losing generality ( multiplicative renormalizability ) [ 13 ] .",
    "it is worth noting also that eq .",
    "( 1.7 ) and eq . ( 1.8 ) describe the leading terms of the corresponding expansions of the quark sd equation and st identity in the ir region , respectively [ 13 ] .    in order to solve the system ( 1.7 - 1.8 ) , it is convenient to represent the quark - gluon vertex function at zero momentum transfer as follows @xmath31 substituting this representation into the st identity ( 1.8 ) , one obtains @xmath32 here the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the euclidean momentum variable @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 with @xmath36 . for the sake of convenience , the ghost self - energy at zero point @xmath37 is included into the definition of a new coupling constant @xmath38^{-1}(2\\pi)^{-2}$ ] .",
    "proceeding now to the dimensionless variables by @xmath39 and parameters @xmath40 , and introducing then the following notations @xmath41 and doing some algebra , the initial system ( 1.7 - 1.8 ) can be rewritten as follows ( normal form ) @xmath42 g(z ) + { 1 \\over z } + \\tilde{m_0}b(z)\\ ] ] @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 .",
    "it is easy to check that solutions to this system in the chiral limit @xmath45 are : @xmath46\\ ] ] and @xmath47    the exact solutions ( 1.14 ) for @xmath48 and ( 1.15 ) for the dynamically generated quark mass function @xmath49 are not entire functions .",
    "the functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 have removable singularities at zero .",
    "in addition , the dynamically generated quark mass function @xmath49 also has algebraic branch points at @xmath50 and at infinity . apparently , these unphysical singularities are due to ghost contributions .",
    "the quark propagator may or may not be an entire function but in either cases the pole - type singularities should disappear .",
    "this is a general feature of quark confinement and holds in any gauge .    in order to reproduce automatically the correct behaviour of the dynamically generated quark mass function at infinity , it is necessary to put @xmath51 in ( 1.15 ) from the very beginning",
    "obviously , in this case solution ( 1.15 ) can not be accepted at zero @xmath52 , so one needs to keep the constant of integration @xmath53 arbitrary but finite in order to obtain a regular , finite solution at zero point .",
    "the region @xmath54 can be considered as nonperturbative , whereas the region @xmath55 can be considered as perturbative . by approximating the full gluon propagator by its deep ir asymptotics such as @xmath56 in the whole range @xmath57",
    ", we nevertheless obtain that our solution for the dynamical quark mass function @xmath49 manifests the existence of the boundary value momentum ( dimensionless ) @xmath53 which separates the ir ( nonperturbative ) region from the intermediate and uv ( perturbative ) regions .",
    "if qcd confines then a characteristic scale , at which confinement and other nonperturbative effects become essential , must exist . on the other hand , because of this one can eliminate the influence of the above mentioned unphysical singularities , coming from the solutions to the quark sd equations ( due to necessary ghost contributions ) , on the @xmath58-matrix elements reproducing physical quantities .",
    "thus , within our approach to qcd at large distances [ 13 ] in order to obtain numerical values of any physical quantity , e.g. the pion decay constant ( see below ) , the integration over the whole range @xmath59 $ ] reduces to the integration over the nonperturbative region @xmath60 , $ ] which determines the range of validity of the deep ir asymptotics ( 1.1 ) of the full gluon propagator and consequently the range of validity of the corresponding solutions ( 1.14 ) and ( 1.15 ) for the ir piece of the full quark propagator .",
    "let us make the main conclusions now .",
    "first , if the enhancement of the zero modes of the vacuum fluctuations ( 1.1 ) takes place indeed then the quark green s function , reconstructed on the basis of this effect , has no poles .",
    "in other words , the enhancement of the zero modes at the expense of the virtual gluons alone removes single quark from the mass - shell ( quark confinement theorem of ref .",
    "second , a chiral symmetry violating part of the quark propagator in this case is automatically generated . from the obtained system ( 1.12 - 1.13 ) it explicitly follows that a chiral symmetry preserving solution ( @xmath61 ) @xmath62 .",
    "so a chiral symmetry violating solution ( @xmath63 ) for the quark sd equation @xmath64 .",
    "thus the enhancement of the zero modes automatically leads to quark confinement and dcsb at the fundamental quark level and they are in close connection with each other .",
    "the effective potential method for composite operators [ 14 ] enables us to investigate the vacuum of qcd since , in the absence of the external sources , the effective potential is nothing but the vacuum energy density , the main characteristic of the vacuum .",
    "the effective potential at one - loop level is [ 14 ] @xmath65 where @xmath66 ( 1.3 ) , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( 1.4 ) , @xmath69 are the full , free quark and gluon propagators , respectively . here and everywhere below the trace over space - time and color group indices",
    "is assumed but they are suppressed .",
    "let us recall that the free gluon propagator can be obtained from ( 1.4 ) by setting simply @xmath70 .",
    "evidently the effective potential is normalized as follows @xmath71 .",
    "because of this normalization the vacuum energy density now should be defined as follows @xmath72 .",
    "this means that the perturbative vacuum is normalized to zero and @xmath73 with @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are given by ( 2.1 ) .",
    "going over to euclidean space ( @xmath77 ) and dimensionless variables and parameters ( 1.11 ) , we finally obtain after some algebra ( @xmath78 ) @xmath79 - 2z g(z ) + 2\\},\\ ] ] where we introduced the uv cutoff which should be identified with the arbitrary constant of integration @xmath53 as was discussed in previous section .",
    "the explicit expressions for @xmath48 and @xmath80 are given by ( 1.14 ) and ( 1.15 ) respectively .",
    "the expression ( 2.2 ) describes the comtributions to the vacuum energy density of the light confining quarks wuth dynamically generated masses .",
    "the vacuum energy density due to the nonperturbative gluon contributions in the same variables is @xmath81 here one important remark is in order .",
    "in fact , vacuum energy density @xmath82 does not vanish at @xmath83 as it should because of the above mentioned normalization .",
    "thus it needs an additional regularization at this limit . from ( 2.3 ) , it follows that the term containing the constant @xmath84 should be substracted from this expression .",
    "so regularized vacuum energy density should be calculated through the relation ( 2.3 ) which becomes @xmath85.\\ ] ]",
    "the vacuum energy density due to confining quarks ( 2.2 ) automatically disappears at @xmath83 , so it does not requires any additional regularization .",
    "the vacuum energy density is important on its own right as the main characteristics of the nonperturbative vacuum of qcd . on the other hand , it makes possible to estimate such important phenomenogical parameter as the gluon condensate introduced within the qcd sum rules approach to resonance physics [ 15 ] .",
    "indeed , through the vacuum energy density @xmath10 it can be expressed as follows @xmath86 the weakness of this derivation [ 15 ] is , of course , that it was obtained on the basis of the perturbative calculation of the @xmath87-function . in any case , it would be instructive to estimate the gluon condensate with the help of ( 2.5 ) .",
    "because of its especially small mass , the pion is the most striking example of the goldstone realization of chiral symmetry @xmath88 . beside the quark condensate and the dynamically generated quark mass it is one of the three important chiral qcd parameters that determine the scale of chiral dynamics .",
    "i. the pion decay constant @xmath89 is defined in the current algebra ( ca ) as @xmath90 ( the normalization @xmath91 is used [ 16 ] ) .",
    "clearly , this matrix element can be written in terms of the pion- quark - antiquark proper vertex and quark propagators as @xmath92 to get expression for @xmath89 one has to differentiate eq .",
    "( 3.2 ) with respect to the external momentum @xmath93 and then set @xmath94 ( fig .",
    "2 ) .    information on the bs pion wave function up to terms of order @xmath15 can be obtained from the corresponding axial - vector vertex .",
    "indeed , in our paper [ 17 ] it has been found that this vertex can be decomposed in a self - consistent way into pole ( dynamical ) and regular parts as follows @xmath95 where the bs bound - state amplitude is @xmath96 with @xmath97 and arbitrary form factors are the residues of the corresponding form factors , entering the vertex from the very beginning [ 17 ] .",
    "the regular part at zero momentum transfer @xmath94 is determined as @xmath98 where in the euclidean space @xmath99 this system is nothing else but the conditions for the cancellation of the dynamical singularities at @xmath94 for the corresponding form factors [ 17 ] .",
    "the regular part at @xmath94 also depends on the same form factors @xmath100 and @xmath101 as the bs bound - state amplitude up to terms of order @xmath15 .    then by taking into account the bs pion wave function up to terms of order @xmath15 , as given by ( 3.4 - 3.5 ) , and ( 1.3 ) with the substitution @xmath102 and expanding in powers of @xmath15 , the expression ( 3.2 )",
    "can easily be evaluated .",
    "going over to euclidean space @xmath103 and using dimensional variables ( 1.11 ) , one finally obtains @xmath104 \\nonumber\\\\     - { 3\\over 4}tabr_{11}(t ) + { 1\\over 4}r_6(t)(e-3b^2 ) \\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the primes denote differentiation with respect to the dimensionless euclidean momentum variable @xmath105 , @xmath106 and quantities with overline are shown after eqs .",
    "( 1.10 ) . here and in what follows",
    "we denote the pion decay constant @xmath89 in the chiral limit of the ca representation by @xmath107 .",
    "the main problem now is to find a good nonperturbative ansatz for both arbitrary form factors @xmath108 in the ir region , which determine the contributions to the pion decay constant from the second diagram in fig .",
    "2 . in the nonperturbative calculations these terms can not be ignored by saying formally they are of order @xmath109 in the coupling constant , as it was done in the perturbative treatments [ 3 , 18 - 19 ] . in connection with this",
    "let us point out that the difference between the vector and axial - vector currents disappears in the chiral limit .",
    "for this reason let us assume [ 20 ] that the ir finite quark - gluon vector vertex function at zero momentum transfer ( 1.9 - 1.10 ) is a good approximation to the regular piece of the axial - vector vertex at zero momentum transfer in the chiral limit ( 3.6 - 3.7 ) .",
    "a fortunate feature that admits to exploit partial analogy between vector and axial - vector currents in the chiral limit for the flavor non - singlet channel is that the contribution to the pion decay constant in the ca representation ( 3.8 ) does not depend on the form factor @xmath110 at all . in this case",
    "the analogy between ( 1.10 ) and ( 3.7 ) becomes complete , and one obtains @xmath111 of course , we can not prove these relations but it will be shown later ( part ii ) that this dynamical assumption ( nonperturbative ansatz ) leads to very good numerical results for all chiral qcd parameters thereby justifying it once more .    in terms of the new parameters and variables ( 1.11 ) and on account of ( 3.9 ) we finally recast ( 3.8 ) as follows @xmath112 this expression will be used for numerical calculation of the pion decay constant in the ca representation .",
    "the other important chiral qcd parameter is the dynamically generated quark mass @xmath113 , defined as the inverse of the full quark propagator ( 1.3 ) in the chiral limit at zero point [ 13 , 17 , 21 ] @xmath114^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath115 denotes the full quark propagator in the chiral limit @xmath116 .",
    "obviously , this definition assumes also regularity at the zero point .",
    "though the dynamical quark mass @xmath113 is not an experimentally observable quantity , by all means , it is desirable to find such kind of solutions to the quark sd equations in which dependence on a gauge - fixing parameter disappears . in this sense @xmath113 defined by ( 3.11 )",
    "becomes gauge - invariant .",
    "as it was briefly discussed in section 1 , exactly such a nonperturbative quark propagator has been found within our approach to qcd at large distances [ 13 ] .    using the standard decomposition of the quark propagator ( 1.3 ) and its inverse , dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) at the fundamental ( microscopic ) quark level can be implemented by the following condition @xmath117 so that the @xmath118 invariance of the quark propagator is broken and the measure of this breakdown is the double of the dynamically generated quark mass function @xmath119 .",
    "precisely this quantity at zero @xmath120 can be defined as a scale of dcsb at the fundamental quark level [ 17 ] . in accordance with ( 3.11 )",
    ", let us denote it by @xmath121 the definitions @xmath113 and @xmath122 have now direct physical sense within the above mentioned solutions to the quark sd equation .",
    "let us write down the final result for the dynamically generated nonperturbative quark mass ( 3.11 ) too , expressed in terms of the new parameters and variables ( 1.11 ) @xmath123 where @xmath124 is given by ( 1.15 ) at zero point .",
    "as it is well known , the order parameter of dcsb - quark condensate can also be expressed in terms of the quark propagator scalar function @xmath125 ( 1.3 ) .",
    "its definition is @xmath126 the final result expressed in terms of new variables and parameters ( 1.11 ) is as follows @xmath127 wher the superscript @xmath128 denotes the chiral limit . as a function of @xmath113 the quark condensate can be expressed on account of ( 3.14 ) .",
    "thus there are only two independent ( free ) quantities by means of which all calculations should be done in our approach .",
    "the first one is the constant of integration @xmath53 of the above mentioned quark sd equation of motion .",
    "the second quantity is a scale @xmath129 at which nonperturbative effects begin to play a dominant role .",
    "the zme model of a true qcd vacuum enables us to describe quark confinement and dcsb on a general ground .",
    "we begin part ii with numerical investigation of the low energy qcd structure at the chiral limit . at low energies qcd is under control of @xmath130 chiral symmetry ( @xmath131 is the number of different flavors ) and its dynamical breakdown in the vacuum to the corresponding vectorial subgroup .",
    "so to correctly calculate basic low energy qcd parameters in the chiral limit means to corectly understand the dynamical structure of qcd at low energies .",
    "that is why it is important to start from the chiral limit .",
