    "the observation of neutrino oscillations  @xcite has revealed that neutrinos have small but non - zero masses , which can not be accommodated in the standard model ( sm ) without introducing extra components . besides , the sm does not provide any candidate for the non - baryonic cold dark matter ( dm ) , which has been confirmed by precisely cosmological observations  @xcite @xmath2 there are also some possible dm events from direct search setting upper - limit on the dm - nucleon scattering cross - section  @xcite , although they still can not be interpreted as significant evidence . to accommodate these observations ,",
    "the minimal sm must be extended .",
    "as so , the dark matter and neutrino physics offer an ideal window to search for physics beyond sm .",
    "it is well known that neutrinos can be dirac or majorana fermions . up to now , the most attractive mechanism responsible for the origin of small neutrino masses",
    "is the so - called seesaw mechanism , by which one can generate majorana masses of three active neutrinos with renormalizable operators at the tree level .",
    "there are three different ways to realize the tree level seesaw mechanism , categorized as type i  @xcite , type ii  @xcite and type iii  @xcite seesaw mechanisms , which can all be naturally embedded into more fundamental frameworks such as the grand unified theories ( guts ) or string theory .",
    "the simplest and well - studied mechanism for generating neutrino masses is the type i seesaw , in which at least two right - handed neutrinos are introduced . in this model ,",
    "experimental light neutrino masses are explained by the ratio of electroweak scale to large majorana mass term @xmath3 which is a suppression factor , given by @xmath4 . the non - ambiguous test of the nature of majorana neutrinos , and thus a possible test of the seesaw mechanism , will be the observation of the lepton number violating ( lnv ) processes .",
    "since the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is going to lead us to a new energy frontier , searching for the heavy majorana neutrinos at the lhc appears to be very appealing .",
    "the ideal production channel to study the lnv processes of heavy majorana neutrino at hadron collider is the drell - yan process via sm gauge boson , @xmath5 .",
    "however , due to the rather small mixing between the heavy neutrinos and the sm leptons in minimal type i seesaw , to the order @xmath6 , the predicted effects of lepton number violation are unlikely to be observable .    the possibility of testing the heavy majorana neutrino at the lhc beyond the minimal type i seesaw has been considered by several groups .",
    "recently one group ( including one of us ) explored the @xmath7 extension of sm  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 is an accidental global symmetry in the sm and its origin is unknown . in order to understand the origin of majorana neutrino masses it is crucial to look for new scenarios where @xmath0 is a local symmetry and can be spontaneously broken . the inclusion of three right - handed neutrinos provides an anomaly - free formulation for the gauged @xmath7",
    ". the new gauge boson @xmath8 can be produced at the lhc via its gauge interactions with the quarks .",
    "its subsequent decay into a pair of heavy majorana neutrinos leads to a large sample of events without involving the small mixing suppression .",
    "the @xmath9 signal @xmath10 with two @xmath11 bosons hadronic decay will directly test the nature of heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "however , because no stringent experiments constrain the mass of heavy majorana neutrino up to now , a pessimistic case with heavy majorana neutrino mass larger than half of @xmath8 boson mass @xmath12 may likely happen in the reality . consequently one can not see any lepton number violating signatures at hadron collider because they are kinematically forbidden .",
    "this dangerous situation motivates us to figure out other neutrino mass generation mechanisms which provide observable signatures in the @xmath7 extension framework .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one introduces only two types of fields , scalar @xmath13 and/or fermion @xmath14 , neutrino masses can be generated at loop level  @xcite .",
    "a salient feature of such radiative seesaw mechanisms is that all the new particles can lie below several tevs naturally and their interactions with sm particles are not heavily constrained by electroweak precision measurements so that they can be directly tested at the lhc .",
    "other discrete symmetries , for instance @xmath15 symmetry , can be imposed by hand to forbid tree level neutrino mass term if new scalar @xmath13 and fermion @xmath14 stay in the same representation as the scalar doublet in sm or the scalar triplet @xmath16 in type ii seesaw , fermionic singlets @xmath17 in type i seesaw or fermionic triplets @xmath18 in type iii seesaw respectively .",
    "consequently the new particles inside the loop only self - interact and couple to sm leptons , and the lightest one is stable which can serve as cold dark matter candidate .",
    "this feature makes it possible to relate the dark matter with neutrino physics .",
    "if we restrict our attention to radiative seesaw extended by an extra abelian gauge symmetry or new representation of other non - abelian gauge groups , for instance @xmath7 extension or adjoint representation of @xmath19  @xcite , such feature can also be achieved .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a particular realization of a radiative seesaw model in the @xmath7 extension of sm . in the exact @xmath7 extension of sm ,",
    "three right - handed neutrinos @xmath20 are introduced and a new scalar field @xmath21 is added to break the local @xmath0 symmetry . besides this framework , we add an extra scalar doublet @xmath22 and two fermions @xmath23 in which @xmath13 has no vacuum expectation value .",
    "the @xmath0 charges of @xmath13 , @xmath23 and @xmath21 are @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . in this model , there are two terms contributing to neutrino masses : tree level term coming from the modified type i seesaw mechanism with right - handed neutrino masses generated after @xmath7 symmetry breaking , and one - loop level term mediated by the new scalar @xmath13 and fermion @xmath23 .",
    "the constraints from lepton flavor violating processes are also studied .",
    "we focus on @xmath27 scenario in which the lighter @xmath14 could serve as the cold dark matter candidate .",
    "relevant cosmological constraints are investigated . due to",
    "the existence of @xmath7 gauge symmetry , charged scalar @xmath28 and dark matter @xmath14 have clear signatures associated with sm charged leptons at the lhc : @xmath29 , even if heavy majorana neutrinos are forbidden to be produced .",
    "we find encouraging results for the lhc signatures of this model to learn about the light neutrino properties and to well - determine the masses of dark matter @xmath14 and its parent particle @xmath13 in such a production topology .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section ii , we describe our model for neutrino masses and dark matter . in section iii , we discuss the constraints on the neutrino mass and mixing parameters from the current neutrino oscillation data , lepton flavor violating processes and cosmological observation .",
    "section iv is devoted to discuss the possibility of detecting the model at the lhc .",
    "we summarize our findings in section v. feynman rules for new particles are presented in the appendix .",
    "in our model the sm is extended with three right - handed majorana neutrinos @xmath30 , one scalar singlet @xmath31 , one scalar doublet @xmath32 and two right - handed majorana fermions @xmath33 , as well as @xmath7 gauge symmetry .",
