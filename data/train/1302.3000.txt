    "finally , section [ secconditioning ] shows that conditioning on the @xmath0-diversity process to be constant , that is , @xmath45 , in a pre - limit version of the particle construction yields , in the limit , the two - parameter model ( [ operatortheta - sigma ] ) with @xmath46 .",
    "the poisson  dirichlet distribution and its two parameter extension belong to the class of random discrete distributions induced by infinite partitions of gibbs type , introduced by @xcite .",

    "we conclude the section with a brief discussion of the interpretation of @xmath0 in the context of species sampling with gibbs - type partitions .",
    "suppose @xmath39 different species have been observed in the first @xmath95 samples from ( [ pitman - urn ] ) .",
    "the probability that a further sample is an already observed species is @xmath96 , but this mass is not allocated proportionally to the current frequencies .",
    "the ratio of probabilities assigned to any pair of species @xmath97 is @xmath98 when @xmath93 , the probability of sampling species @xmath99 is proportional to the absolute frequency @xmath100 .",

    "see @xcite for a more detailed treatment of this aspect .",
    "in this section we investigate some properties of generalized gamma random measures which will be used in the subsequent constructions .",
    "in particular , these regard the convergence of the number of species represented only once in the observed sample , and the second order approximation of the weights of the generalized plya - urn scheme associated with normalized inverse - gaussian processes .",
    "let @xmath63 be an @xmath95-sized sample drawn from a generalized gamma process with parameters @xmath109 , let @xmath39 denote the number of distinct species observed in the sample , and let @xmath110 denote the vector of absolute frequencies associated with each observed species .",
    "the probability distribution of the random variable @xmath111 , for any @xmath112 , @xmath113 and frequencies @xmath48 such that @xmath114 , is provided by @xcite and coincides with @xmath115\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\qquad = \\frac{\\alpha^{k-1}e^{\\beta}\\prod_{j=1}^{k}(1-\\alpha ) _ { ( n_{j}-1)}}{\\gamma(n)}\\sum_{s=0}^{n-1}\\pmatrix{n-1\\cr s}(-1)^{s}\\beta ^{s/\\alpha}\\gamma\\biggl(k-\\frac{s}{\\alpha};\\beta\\biggr),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are as in ( [ pochhammer ] ) and ( [ incomplete - gamma ] ) , respectively .",
