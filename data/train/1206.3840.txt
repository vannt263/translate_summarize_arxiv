    "single dish submm telescopes equipped with wide bandwidth bolometer cameras have discovered a large population of galaxies in the distant universe that are extremely bright in mm / submm wavelengths ( submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the bright ( @xmath6  mjy ) smg population typically shows evidence of enhanced massive star formation activity ( sfr @xmath7  m@xmath2  yr@xmath5 ) with rapid gas consumption timescales ( @xmath8  myr : @xcite ) and complex kinematics @xcite , which are all consistent with the properties expected for gas - rich major mergers at high redshifts . results from these early observations are also consistent with the scenario where present - day massive galaxies acquire the bulk of their stellar mass at early epochs .",
    "smgs contribute 10 - 20% to the cosmic star formation at @xmath9 @xcite , but the lack of precise redshifts have been the significant source of uncertainty .",
    "the redshift determination has been further hampered by the faintness of the optical counterparts even for those that are identified through direct submm interferometric imaging ( e.g. ; @xcite ) .",
    "uncertainties in the redshifts also affect the derivation of the clustering strength ( hatsukade et al . , in prep ) and the dark halo mass , which are both important parameters in the framework of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology .",
    "the most direct way to determine the redshifts of smgs is to conduct wide - band spectroscopic observations in the radio / mm / submm wavelengths through detections of the carbon monoxide ( co ) emission .",
    "recent observations using single dish telescopes have shown this to be effective ( i.e. gbt - zpectrometer , iram  30m - emir , cso - zspec , lmt - rsr ; @xcite ) .",
    "significant detection of two consecutive co rotational transitions is needed for a secure determination of the redshift .",
    "in addition , these observations will allow us to quantify the molecular gas mass and its dynamical status through the co line width .",
    "this will further allow us to derive the gas mass fraction , star formation efficiencies , and the gas - to - dust mass ratio , all of which are important quantities related to their physical conditions and possibly their future evolution .",
    "the 45 m telescope at nobeyama has undergone a major upgrade , with an installation of a new two - beam receiver , an intermediate frequency ( if ) transmission system , an analogue - to - digital converter ( adc ) with a sampling rate of 4  ghz , and a new 32  ghz wide spectrometer .",
    "the final goal of this project is to obtain redshifts of the bright submm sources blindly from co observations that are near or beyond the peak of the cosmic star formation . in order to assess the capabilities of the newly upgraded 45 m telescope , we have targeted five sources that are bright in submm continuum and have spectroscopic redshifts , determined either via conventional optical / infrared observations , or via co. the sources we select in this pilot study are , sxdf  1100.001 ( orochi ) @xcite , sdp9 , and sdp17 @xcite , sdss  j160705 + 533558 @xcite , and cosmos - aztec1 @xcite .",
    "these sources have apparent infrared luminosities of @xmath10  l@xmath2 , and are promising sources for co detection .",
    "we adopt h@xmath11 = 71  km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 , @xmath12 = 0.27 , @xmath13 = 0.73 for all of the analysis throughout this paper .",
    "the radio signal collected by the 45 m telescope dish is received by the new two - beam , two - polarization , sideband separating receiver ( tz receiver ) @xcite .",
    "the two beams are separated by @xmath14 in the sky .",
    "the sky signal is separated into two linear polarizations by a waveguide - type ortho - mode transducer , and an if quadrature hybrid is then used to separate the two sidebands .",
    "the local oscillator frequency tuning rage is 80  115  ghz , with an if bandwidth of 4  8  ghz . a future expansion to 4  12  ghz is planned .",
    "the if signal is amplified and down - converted to 2  4  ghz where the signal is digitized to 3-bits at the adc . the digital signal is then transferred through optical fiber cables to the digital back - end .",
    "the digital back - end is an exact copy of the atacama compact array ( aca ) @xcite fx - type correlator @xcite .",
    "the 32  ghz total bandwidth is divided into 16 arrays , each with 2  ghz of bandwidth . when used at its maximum capability",
    ", it will accommodate the full 4  8  ghz if signal from the tz receiver .",
    "observations were carried out during the 2011/2012 winter observing season .",
    "the single sideband system temperature varied from 170 - 250  k , and we have tuned the orthogonal polarizations of each beam to the same sky frequency to gain @xmath15 in sensitivity .",
    "the sideband rejection ratio is typically @xmath16 8db at the center of the if .",
    "since the source is always observed in one of the beams ( 16 to @xmath17 at the observed frequencies ) of the tz receiver , the dominant observing overhead is the telescope slewing time during switching , and it is @xmath18  seconds per cycle .",
    "we have adopted a 5  10 second switching cycle to optimize the observing overhead and the bandpass stability .",
    "the chopper - wheel method was used for absolute temperature calibration with an accuracy of 20% .",
    "the output auto - correlation spectrum , which contains 4096  channels with a frequency resolution of 488  khz , is then calibrated on - line and stored in the database .",
    "data reduction was carried out using the facility data reduction software package newstar .",
    "since the 45 m pointing accuracy is significantly affected by wind , only the data taken with wind velocity less than 5  m  s@xmath5 were used .",
    "the pointing accuracy under these conditions is typically 2@xmath19 in rms .",
    "in addition , we flagged scans with visually poor baselines by inspecting each spectrum by eye .",
    "the final spectra are generated by integrating all of the good scans in the data , and a zeroth order baseline is subtracted from each spectrum .",
    "the average on - source time ranged from 5  11 hours .",
    "the antenna temperature is then converted to main - beam temperature by adopting a main - beam efficiency of 0.4 , which is the average value obtained using the t100 receiver near the observing frequencies .",
    "nro45mrt @xmath20 prop @xmath20 status @xmath20 status_r11.html ] a typical 1@xmath21 sensitivity after one hour integration is @xmath2258  mjy under these observing conditions and instrumental setup .",
    "the co spectra are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] and the derived properties are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "( 150mm,100mm)figure1.eps      sdp  17b was originally discovered in the herschel - astrophysical terahertz large area survey ( h - atlas ) @xcite in the science demonstration phase ( sdp ) as a population of submillimeter - bright strongly lensed galaxies @xcite .",
    "this source was subsequently followed up with z - spec on board the caltech submillimeter observatory , detecteding co  ( 87 ) , co  ( 76 ) , co  ( 65 ) emission in the 200  300 ghz band @xcite .",
    "the derived redshift is @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , @xcite have used the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) to detect significant h@xmath24o emission .",
    "the co  ( 32 ) emission from sdp17b is the brightest among all lines detected in this pilot study .",
    "the 45 m telescope observes a lower rotational transition of co than those detected using z - spec , allowing us to investigate the co excitation conditions .",
    "while the uncertainties in the high - j co line fluxes are relatively high , the co excitation ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) appears low and may peak near the mid - j lines detected at z - spec .",
    "this evidence for relatively low co excitation is consistent with other smgs studied in multi - line co @xcite .",
    "sdp9 is another source detected in the h - atlas .",
    "the co  ( 65 ) and co  ( 54 ) emission have been detected with z - spec @xcite , yielding a redshift of @xmath25 .",
    "we detected the co  ( 21 ) line from sdp9 with 8-sigma confidence .",
    "the derived redshift is 0.003 smaller than the z - spec redshift .",
    "in contrast to sdp17b , the co excitation appears high and does not show significant signs of decrement at mid - j co lines .",

    "its 1.1  mm flux density is 37  mjy , making this the brightest smg found in the subaru / xmm - newton deep field ( sxdf ) and may be gravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy @xcite .",
    "this source is detected by herschel multi - tiered extragalactic survey ( hermes ) , also known as hxmm02 , and found to be very bright in herschel / spire bands @xcite .",
    "the photometric redshift was estimated to be @xmath52 using submm to radio continuum fluxes from sma , z - spec , carma , and vla @xcite .",
    "subsequent co  ( 32 ) , ( 43 ) , and ( 54 ) detections with carma and pdbi confirm that hxmm02 is at @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the co  ( 10 ) is also measured using gbt ( inoue et al .",
    "2012 , in prep . ) .",
    "the co  ( 43 ) line of orochi is best fit with a two component gaussian .",
    "the double peak spectrum may suggest a merging galaxy , or a presence of systematic rotation of a large gas concentration .",

    "sdss  j160705 + 533558  ( sdss  j1607 ) is a submm bright quasar at @xmath54 with an infrared luminosity exceeding @xmath55  l@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "followup @xmath56 sma observation has found a resolved dust component with the peak located @xmath57 north of the optical quasar .",
    "the large submm flux is equivalent to a dusty sfr of 3000  8000 m@xmath2  yr@xmath5 .",
    "the submm emission appears to be resolved in the north - south direction , and @xcite suggest either a merging galaxy or an interaction with an agn jet for the unusual submm morphology .",
    "we tentatively detect the co  ( 43 ) line in sdss  j1607 .",
    "the linewidth and molecular gas mass are both consistent with other high redshift quasars detected in co @xcite , but the gas depletion time scale ( m@xmath58sfr ) of 14  37  myr is slightly smaller than the average of quasars @xcite .",
    "this suggests a short and vigorous burst of star formation in sdss  j1607 .",
    "cosmos - aztec1 is a source discovered by the aztec survey on jcmt @xcite , followed up by the submillimeter array @xcite .",
    "subsequent keck deimos spectroscopy has derived a redshift of @xmath59 but the co  ( 54 ) emission was not detected in the redshift range 4.56  4.76 and 4.94  5.02 @xcite .",
    "we searched for the co emission in the redshift range 4.38  4.56 , but did not detect any significant emission with a 3-sigma mass upper limit of @xmath60  m@xmath2 , assuming a line width of 400  km  s@xmath5 and co  ( 54 ) to co  ( 10 ) ratio of 0.32 @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , these non - detections could imply a low co excitation or an incorrect redshift .",
    "we present new co observations toward five submm bright high redshift sources from the upgraded nobeyama 45 m telescope .",
    "all of the detected sources have large molecular gas mass ( m@xmath61  m@xmath2 ) and line - widths ( 430  530  km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "one source ( orochi ) shows a double peak spectrum .",
    "we plan to expand this project by tuning the two different polarizations to different frequencies , allowing us to instantaneously observe 16  ghz bandwidth in a single beam .",
    "further , a new dual - color tes bolometer camera ( oshima et al .",
