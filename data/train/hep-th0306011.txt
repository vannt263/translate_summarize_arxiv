    "in 1948 casimir predicted an unexpected quantum field theory ( qft ) effect : as a consequence of distorting the vacuum of the quantized electromagnetic field , two conducting and neutral parallel plates should attract each other with a force proportional to the inverse of the fourth power of their separation @xcite ( for general reviews on the casimir effect , see refs .",
    "@xcite ; for an introductory guide , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the first attempt to observe this phenomenon",
    "was made only in 1958 by sparnaay @xcite .",
    "however , the accuracy achieved by sparnaay allowed him only to conclude that the experimental data was compatible with casimir s theoretical predictions . for different reasons ,",
    "new experiments involving directly metal bodies were performed only very recently @xcite , but this time the high accuracy obtained and the excellent agreement between the experimental data and theory permit us to state safely that the casimir effect is well established nowadays .",
    "the casimir effect is not a peculiarity of the quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "in fact , the vacuum state ( and its energy ) of any relativistic quantum field , bosonic or fermionic , depends on the boundary conditions ( bc ) imposed on the fields or , more generally , on the classical background with which the fields interact .",
    "this makes the casimir effect an important topic of research , with applications in many branches of physics ( see bordag _",
    "et al . _  in @xcite ) .",
    "even though qft is mainly concerned with interacting fields , most papers on the casimir effect deals with non - interacting fields .",
    "the computation of radiative corrections to the casimir energy of interacting fields has been performed in relatively few papers .",
    "( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite in the context of qed , and refs .",
    "@xcite for scalar fields . )    for non - interacting fields , the casimir energy is given by the sum , properly regularized and renormalized , of the zero - point energy of the normal modes of the fields , which behave as a collection of independent harmonic oscillators .",
    "hence , at the one - loop level the casimir energy is sensitive only to the fields eigenfrequencies , but not to their eigenmodes .",
    "this is the reason why , for instance , the casimir energy of a scalar field confined between two parallel plates is the same for dirichlet or neumann bc on both plates . in the case of interacting fields",
    "the situation is more complicated : the independent harmonic oscillators become anharmonic and coupled when the interaction is turned on .",
    "therefore , one has to take into account not only the oscillators zero - point energy  which are modified by the interaction , as in the lamb shift  , but also the interaction energy among the oscillators @xcite .",
    "this should made the radiative corrections to the casimir energy sensitive to the form of the eigenmodes ; in particular , it should depend on the bc imposed on the fields . in spite of this ,",
    "krech and dietrich @xcite showed that the @xmath1 correction to the casimir energy of the massless @xmath0 theory is the same for dirichlet and neumann bc on a pair of plates .",
    "our purpose here is to report the results of our investigation @xcite on whether that equality is also true for a massive field .",
    "we computed the @xmath1 radiative correction to the casimir energy of the massive @xmath0 theory subject to dirichlet and neumann bc on a pair of parallel plates .",
    "our results show that the mentioned equality is valid only in the massless cases .",
    "we also extend our calculations to the case in which the field is subject to dirichlet bc on one of the plates and to neumann bc on the other one .",
    "in order to introduce some notation and basic ideas , we briefly sketch in this section some results for the casimir energy of a non - interacting massive scalar field submitted to bc at @xmath2 and @xmath3 . , @xmath4 .",
    "] we shall consider three distinct bc , denoted by dd , nn and dn , and given , respectively , by : ( i ) @xmath5 ; ( ii ) @xmath6 , and ( iii ) @xmath7 .",
    "the casimir energy per unit area when dirichlet or neumann bc are used on the two planes is given by @xmath8 for the mixed bc ( dirichlet - neumann ) , we get @xmath9.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the small mass limit ( @xmath10 ) of these expressions is given by @xmath11 @xmath12 on the other hand , in the large mass limit ( @xmath13 ) eqs .",
    "( [ e0 ] ) and ( [ e0dn ] ) yield @xmath14 @xmath15 it is worth noting that the first term on the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ ddmassanula ] ) is precisely half the casimir energy per unit area for the electromagnetic field between two perfectly conducting ( or infinitely permeable ) parallel plates @xcite , while the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ dnmassanula ] ) is half the casimir energy per unit area for the electromagnetic field between a perfectly conducting plate and an infinitely permeable one @xcite .",
    "now we shall consider the @xmath0 model , defined by the euclidean lagrangian density @xmath16 where @xmath17 contains the usual renormalization counterterms . the interacting field is submitted to one of the three bc",
    "already considered before .",
    "( however , we shall present the calculations only for the dn case , as the other two bc were considered in detail in @xcite . ) using perturbation theory , the @xmath1 correction to the previous results can be written as @xmath18 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the green function of the non - interacting theory , but obeying the bc , @xmath20 is the radiatively induced shift in the mass parameter , and @xmath21 is the shift in the cosmological constant ( i.e. , the change in the vacuum energy which is due solely to the interaction , and not to the confinement ) .    the spectral representation of the euclidean green function in @xmath22-dimensions is given by @xmath23 where , in the dn case , @xmath24 @xmath25    note that @xmath19 diverges when @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , a regularization prescription is needed . using dimensional regularization we obtain @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "now we need to compute the terms appearing in eq .",

    "the structure of poles of @xmath34 is dictated by the @xmath40 function : there are simple poles at @xmath41 .",
    "let us now choose the renormalization conditions for @xmath20 and @xmath21 . with this goal , recall that up to first order in @xmath42 the self - energy is given by @xmath43 .",
    "we shall fix @xmath44 by imposing the following conditions on @xmath45 : ( i ) @xmath46 ( except possibly at some special points ) ; ( ii ) @xmath45 vanishes away from the plates when @xmath47 : @xmath48 for @xmath49 , and ( iii ) @xmath20 must be independent of @xmath50 .",
    "these conditions are fulfilled by taking @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the non - interacting green function _ without boundary conditions _ evaluated at the point @xmath53 .",
    "computing @xmath54 within dimensional regularization , we get @xmath55    for the shift in the cosmological constant we shall take @xmath56 . with this choice one eliminates the term proportional to @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ e4passo ] ) , which does not contribute to the force between the plates ( the linear dependence on @xmath50 is canceled by similar terms when one adds the energy of the regions @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",

    "it follows from eqs .",

    "equals our @xmath70 plus one . ]    in the large mass limit ( @xmath13 ) we have @xmath71 @xmath72 two aspects of the results above are worth of mention : ( i ) while for @xmath73 @xmath65 is positive for all @xmath50 , for @xmath74 it eventually becomes negative for sufficiently large @xmath50 ( more precisely , for @xmath75 ) ; ( ii ) while @xmath76 decays with distance ( or mass ) as fast as @xmath77 for dd or nn boundary conditions [ cf .",
    "( [ edd0 m ] ) and ( [ edd1 m ] ) ] , the former decays faster than the latter in the dn case [ cf .",
    "( [ edn0 m ] ) and ( [ edn1 m ] ) ] .",
    "we have computed the first radiative correction to the casimir energy of the massive @xmath0 model subject to three distinct bc on a pair of parallel plates .",
    "we showed that while for a massless field dd and nn boundary conditions lead to the same @xmath1 radiative correction ( an unexpected result ) , this is not true for a massive field . in addition , that correction presents very distinct behavior as a function of the distance @xmath50 between the plates : while @xmath78 first increases and then decreases with @xmath50 , @xmath79 first decreases and then increases with @xmath50 ( see fig .  [ 3graficos ] ) .",
    "as a consequence , a pair of dd plates is more attracted to each other than a pair of nn plates when the distance between the plates is sufficiently small ; the opposite occurs when the plates are far apart .",
    "we also computed for the first time the @xmath1 radiative correction to the casimir energy for that model subject to dn boundary conditions ( i.e. , dirichlet bc on one plate and neumann bc on the other ) .",
    "our results show that in this case the correction to the one - loop result is much smaller than in the dd or nn cases for large separations between the plates ( i.e. , for @xmath80 ) .",
