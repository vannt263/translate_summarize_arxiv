    "previously , the authors theoretically and numerically demonstrated that chaotic oscillation occurs in a nanoscale system consisting of a pair of quantum dots ( qds ) , between which energy transfers via optical near - field interactions  @xcite .",
    "the chaotic oscillation occurs at the values of the existence probability of an exciton in one of the qds when the qds are connected with an external time delay .",
    "it is scientifically and technologically important to elucidate the exact nature of this new oscillatory phenomenon , which we call `` nanochaos , '' since it implies that ultrafast random number generators  @xcite , problem solvers  @xcite , and decision makers  @xcite can be constructed by the nanoscale elements . for simplicity in modeling the oscillation in the probability of random selection operations ,",
    "we consider a one - dimensional random - walk model in this study , in which the flight probability to one of the two directions , which is called `` bias , '' fluctuates .",
    "our random - walk model with a fluctuating bias is different from the previously studied langevin equation model that has a fluctuating diffusion coefficient , which was proposed to investigate the diffusion phenomena of a particle with inner degrees of freedom , e.g. , a cell , the center - of - mass motion in the reptation model , and diffusion in a heterogeneous environment  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the diffusivity in our model does not change , even while the bias fluctuates . on the other hand ,",
    "sinai s random - walk model uses a bias that fluctuates depending on the position of a particle  @xcite .",
    "our model is used to evaluate how the chaotic dynamics in the time - dependent bias fluctuation contribute to diffusion phenomena , whereas the sinai model having the position - dependent bias is not useful for our purposes .    in section",
    "ii , we will define our random - walk model with a fluctuating bias by introducing some time series data taken from numerical simulations of the quantum - dot network model . in section iii",
    ", we will present simulation results obtained by our model , including a new accelerated diffusion phenomenon . to clarify the mechanism of accelerated diffusion , we will introduce a simplified model of our random walk and will present theoretical explanations of the mechanism in section iv .",

    "random walks can be generated by chaotic time series . in previous studies ,",
    "we usually obtain coarse - grained ( binary ) time series of the chaotic times series by using a fixed threshold of @xmath1  @xcite . in other words",
    ", we use chaotic time series instead of a random number generator ( rng ) , where a right flight is generated ( @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 ) if a random number @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath1 or a left flight ( @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath7 ) otherwise . the trajectory @xmath8",

    "in other words , we treat chaotic time series as the `` probabilities '' for a left flight , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "therefore , the bias fluctuates in this random walk .",
    "first , we prepare a good rng that generates real values between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we used the mersenne twister ( mt )  @xcite in this study . using the rng",
    ", we treat each value of the time series as a threshold at the time . in other words , if the value of the rng at time @xmath12 is larger than the threshold ( the value of the time series ) , @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 ( right flight ) ; otherwise , @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath7 ( left flight ) . to construct a normalized threshold time series within @xmath15 $ ] , we executed the following preprocessing for the time series we use , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , @xmath11 , @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mean and standard deviation of @xmath16 , respectively .",

    "diffusion can be characterized by the mean square displacement ( msd ) .",
    "there are two procedures for obtaining the average of the msd , i.e. , the ensemble average and time average . although one can use different realizations of the fluctuating bias in the random walk to calculate the msd , we take the average for a single time series of the bias generated by the previous study  @xcite .",
    "it follows that the msd crucially depends on the time series . to extract overall diffusion property ,",
    "we take both averages , i.e. , the ensemble average of the time - averaged mean square displacement ( etmsd ) , defined as @xmath33 where @xmath8 is the position at time @xmath12 with the initial condition @xmath34 , @xmath35 denotes the ensemble average with respect to the noise ( the seed of the rng ) , and @xmath18 is the total measurement time length ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we note that the ensemble average is taken under one realization of the fluctuating bias ( the threshold time series is fixed ) .",
    "when there is no bias , i.e. , @xmath36 , the etmsd exhibits normal diffusion , i.e. , etmsd(@xmath37 ) @xmath38 .    ( a ) plotted with logarithmic scales.,width=453 ]    figures  [ fig:3](a ) and ( b ) show the etmsds of the time series shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "we can confirm that the etmsds do not monotonically increase , except in the ordinary one ( the case with a fixed probability of @xmath1 ) .",
    "in particular , the etmsd for the chaotic time series undergoes many large changes in a short time interval owing to the transient nonstationarity of its biases , although the overall time dependence of the etmsd is proportional to the time , which indicates normal diffusion , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) .",
    "we confirmed that the etmsd at @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath11 increases linearly with the time when we periodically generate @xmath22 with a period of @xmath41 ( not shown ) .",

    "the power law distribution means that there is no characteristic sojourn - time length .",
    "this is one of the properties of superdiffusion shown in the lvy walk  @xcite .",
    "however , the power law distribution is not perfect in the case of no . 180 .",
    "the @xmath0-run distribution does not follow a power law , whereas the @xmath42-run distribution follows a short power law . as a result ,",
    "the overall property is classified as normal diffusion .    among the nanochaos data sets , we can observe superdiffusion in our model if we find a time series of chaotic probability , such as the modified bernoulli map ( aizawa map  @xcite ) , that generates power law distributions .",

    "in this section , we consider a simple stochastic model related to a random walk with a fluctuating bias , which can generate a variety of diffusion types , as shown in fig .  [ fig : t ] .",
    "the model is a simple generalization of a lvy walk , in which a random walker performs a two - state biased random walk with a random persistence time .",

    "the msds can be analytically calculated for several persistence time distributions .",
    "using the analytical results of the stochastic model , we can understand that the overall properties in nanochaos data we treat in this paper are all classified as normal diffusion ( see eq .",
    "( [ t1.0 ] ) ) .      in a lvy walk , a random walker moves to the right or left with a constant velocity for a continuous random persistence time . after the persistence time , the random walker can change direction . instead , a random walker in our model performs a biased random walk with a probability of going to the left of @xmath58 ( the probability of going to the right is @xmath61 ) for a continuous random persistence time . in what follows",
