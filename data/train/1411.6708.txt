    "the obtained binding energies are scattered in a broad range : 1020  mev for shallow potential cases and 50100  mev for deep cases .",
    "the width would be as wide as 70  mev because of the strong @xmath12-@xmath14 coupling .",
    "in addition there could be non - mesonic absorption contributions of @xmath15 .",
