    "[ tab : efficienciesstokes ] [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in our setup we were able to manipulate the gate duration and thus check how the values of the effective gains depend on the time of interaction .",
    "we measured the effective gains for two different gate durations covering @xmath156s write pulse and a part of @xmath157s read pulse selected by a gate duration @xmath158s or @xmath159s , as we depicted in fig .",

    "we checked that the anti - stokes effective gain @xmath161 remained independent of the interaction time which indicates that light that has been correlated with the stored spin - waves is always retrieved in the beginning stage of the readout . on the other hand ,",
    "the efficiency of the stokes scattering varies , as we summarized in table [ tab : efficienciesstokes ] .",
    "as we can see , longer interaction time increases the effective gain @xmath144 and in particular we can obtain more correlated light than we did at the write - in stage @xmath162 .",
    "this corresponds to the case where the integrated gain @xmath69 significantly exceeded unity and overcompensated for the losses , albeit bringing a large amount of accompanying noise * @xmath70 .",
    "* such a high gain of the obtained signal can find an application in various operations with quantum memories .",
    "for instance the dominant stokes scattering process can be utilized for testing if the memory is empty**. * * no photons retrieved from the memory at the readout may suggest that memory was initially empty with a certain probability .",
    "this probability is much higher for amplified readout with stokes interaction dominant as opposed to conventional pure anti - stokes readout process of limited efficiency .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented an experimental demonstration of manipulation of the hamiltonian in the readout from raman - type atomic memory .",
    "we measured the temporal evolution of the readout light and the spatial correlations between the raman scattering in the write - in and the readout .",
    "our measurements confirm the adjustability of coupling parameters corresponding to the anti - stokes and stokes scattering .",
    "the results match our simple theoretical model of a full four - wave mixing process .",
    "we resolved the anti - stokes and the stokes scattering contributions to the readout thanks to the phase matching in the atomic vapor which dictated directional correlations with the stokes photons during write - in .",
    "our results provide a very simple framework for interpretation of extra noise in experiments on storing light in atomic vapor . when anti - stokes scattering is used to map the spin - wave states onto the states of light , the accompanying stokes scattering creates unwanted random photons and atomic excitations .",
    "our results show that , though inevitable , this contribution can be estimated by our model and perhaps suppressed by adjusting the coupling light frequency to the other side of the atomic resonance .",
    "there is also an optimal duration for the anti - stokes interaction .",
    "beyond the optimum , the spontaneous noise contribution increases",
    ". it may be favorable to switch to noncollinear configuration where control and quantum fields enter the atomic medium at a small angle .",
    "then the stokes scattering photons will become directionally distinguishable from the anti - stokes , which may lower the noise in some experiments .",
    "the design of the hamiltonian we demonstrated can be implemented in many types of quantum memories at little or no extra cost .",
    "the amplification of readout signal by stokes scattering may be very useful in some applications especially if extra noise is not crucial .",
    "this is the case when we use detectors of small quantum efficiency or we are focused on other properties of retrieved light e.g. in retrieval of stored images @xcite .",
    "for instance the amplification in the readout can be utilized as a robust single - shot projective test to see whether the atomic memory is in the ground ( empty ) state .",
    "a complete absence of stokes signal on an inefficient detector is a relatively rare occurrence if the extra stokes gain overcompensates for the losses at the detection stage .",
    "notably then , complete absence of signal ensures us that the memory was in the ground state",
    ".    our results can be useful for suppressing unconditional noise floor in readout of raman - type quantum memories at the single photon level @xcite .",
    "we provide evidence for a possibility of engineering a wide range of atom - light interfaces which can be described theoretically as simultaneous readout and parametric amplification e.g. quantum non - demolition interaction while coupling coefficients are equal .",
