    "financial data have attracted a lot of attention from physicists as informative material to investigate the macroscopic behavior of markets @xcite .",
    "some of these studies are restricted to the stochastic variables of the price changes ( returns ) and most of them concern a key - word : _ fat tails _ of the distributions @xcite .",
    "however , also the distribution of time intervals can deliver useful information on the markets and it is worth while to investigate these properties extensively @xcite and if possible , to apply the gained knowledge to financial engineering .",
    "fluctuations in time intervals between events are not only peculiar to financial markets , but also very common in science .",
    "for instance , the spike train of a single neuron is characterized by a time series in which the time difference between consecutive spikes is not constant but fluctuates .",
    "this stochastic process , specified by the so - called inter - spike intervals ( isi ) , is one of such examples @xcite .",
    "the average of the isi is about a few milli - seconds and the distribution of the durations ( intervals ) is well - described by the _ gamma distribution _",
    "@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in financial markets , for instance , the time intervals of two consecutive transactions of bund futures ( bund is the german word for bond ) and btp futures ( btp is the middle and long term italian government bonds with fixed interest rates ) traded at liffe ( liffe stands for london international financial futures and options exchange ) are @xmath0 seconds and are well - fitted by the so - called _ mittag - leffler distribution _ @xcite .",
    "the mittag - leffler distribution behaves as a stretched exponential distribution in the short interval regime , whereas for the long interval regime , the function has a power - law tail .",
    "therefore , the behavior of the distribution described by the mittag - leffler function varies from stretched exponential to power - law at some intermediate critical interval @xcite .    the sony bank usd / jpy exchange rate @xcite , ( i.e. the rate for individual customers of the sony bank in their on - line foreign exchange trading service ) is a good example to be checked against the mittag - leffler distribution . actually , our results implied that the mittag - leffler distribution does not well fit the sony bank rate @xcite .",
    "the sony bank rate has @xmath1 minutes @xcite as the average time interval which is much longer than other market time intervals such as those for the bund future .",
    "this is due to the fact that the the sony back rate can be regarded as a so - called _ first - passage process _",
    "@xcite for raw market data .",
    ".[tab : table0 ] three typical examples with fluctuation between events . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is a non - trivial problem to ask what kind of distribution is suitable to explain the distribution of the first - passage time . for this problem",
    ", we attempted to check several statistics from both the analytical and the empirical points of view under the assumption that the first - passage time might obey a weibull distribution @xcite .",
    "we found that the data are well fitted by a weibull distribution .",
    "this fact means that the difference between successive rate changes in sony bank fluctuates and has some memory .",
    "in this section , we derive the distribution of the waiting time for the customers .",
    "our approach enables us to evaluate not only the first moment of the waiting time but also moments of any order .",
    "we first derive the probability distribution function of the waiting time @xmath2 .",
    "let us suppose that the difference between two consecutive points of the sony bank rate change , namely , the first - passage time @xmath3 follows the distribution with probability density function @xmath4 .",
    "then , the customers observe the rate at time @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) that should be measured from the point at which the rate previously changed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg9b ] , we show the relation among these variables @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath2 in the time axis .     and @xmath2 in time axis .",
    "the first - passage time @xmath3 is given by @xmath7 .",
    "the observation time is measured from the point @xmath8 . , width=321 ]    the waiting time for the customers is naturally defined as @xmath9 .",
    "now , notice that the distribution @xmath10 can be written in terms of the first - passage time distribution ( with density @xmath4 ) and the observation time distribution ( with density @xmath11 ) of the customers as a convolution @xmath12 in this equation , the conditional probability density @xmath13 that the waiting time takes the value @xmath2 provided that the observation time and the first - passage time were given as @xmath5 and @xmath3 , respectively , is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is dirac s delta function .",
    "taking into account the normalization constant of @xmath10 , we have @xmath16 where , again , @xmath5 denotes the observation time for the customers .",
    "the result of the renewal - reward theorem : @xmath17 ( see for example @xcite ) is recovered by inserting a uniformly distributed observation time distribution @xmath18 into the above expression .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath19 where we defined the @xmath20-th moment of the first - passage time @xmath21 by @xmath22 more generally , we may choose a non - uniform @xmath11 .",
    "for this general form of the observation time distribution , the probability distribution of the waiting time @xmath2 is given as follows .",
    "@xmath23 where we defined @xmath24 by @xmath25 by using the same method as in the derivation of the distribution @xmath10 , we easily obtain the first two moments of the waiting time distribution as @xmath26 and the study of the standard deviation leads to @xmath27 @xmath28 where we defined @xmath29 thus , this probability distribution @xmath10 enables us to evaluate moments of any order for the waiting time .",
    "we consider the case of @xmath30 as an example .",
    "this case corresponds to the result obtained by the renewal - reward theorem @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath31 holds for arbitrary integer @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the waiting time distribution @xmath10 leads to @xmath32 then , the average waiting time and the deviation around the value lead to @xmath33 for a weibull distribution having the parameters @xmath34 , the above results can be re - written as @xmath35 where we defined the gamma function as @xmath36 it is important for us to notice that for an exponential distribution @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 by taking into account the fact that @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , the average waiting time @xmath40 is identical to the average time interval @xmath41 since @xmath42 holds if and only if @xmath37 ( the rate change follows a poisson arrival process ) .",
    "these results are obtained by using a different method in our previous studies @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg9c ] , we plot the distribution @xmath10 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .     with @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    ", width=321 ]      it is time to compare the analytical result with that of the empirical data analysis . for uniform observation time distribution @xmath48 , we obtained @xmath49 minutes . on the other hand , from empirical data analysis",
    ", we evaluate the quantity ( [ eq : def_dev ] ) by sampling the moment as @xmath50 directly from sony bank rate data @xcite and find @xmath51 minutes .",
    "there exists a finite gap between the theoretical prediction and the result by the empirical data analysis , however , both results are of the same order of magnitude",
    ". the gap might become small if we take into account the power - law tail of the first - passage time distribution .",
    "in fact , we showed that for the average waiting time , the power - law tail makes the gap between the theoretical prediction and empirical observation smaller @xcite .",
    "here we encounter the situation which is known as `` inspection paradox '' . for the weibull distribution ,",
    "the paradox occurs for @xmath52 .",
    "namely , for this regime , we have @xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : inspect ] ) . in general , it means that the average of durations ( first - passage times ) is shorter than the average waiting time .     and",
    "average waiting time @xmath54 as a function of @xmath55 for a weibull duration distribution with @xmath45 .",
    "the inspection paradox occurs for @xmath52.,width=321 ]    this fact is quite counter - intuitive because the customer checks the rate at a time between arbitrary consecutive rate changes .",
    "this fact is intuitively understood as follows .",
    "when the parameter @xmath55 is smaller than @xmath56 , the bias of the duration is larger than that of the exponential distribution . as a result ,",
    "the chance for customers to check the rate within large intervals between consecutive price changes is more frequent than the chance they check the rate within shorter intervals .",
    "then , the average waiting time can become longer than the average duration .",
    "as we showed in this paper , our queueing theoretical approach might be useful to build artificial markets such as the on - line trading service so as to have a suitable waiting time for the individual customers by controlling the width of the rate window .",
    "moreover , the theoretical framework we provided here could predict the average waiting time including the deviation from empirical results .",
