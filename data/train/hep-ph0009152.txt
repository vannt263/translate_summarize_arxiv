    "the widely accepted interpretation of the phenomenology of grbs , bursts of 0.1 mev1 mev photons lasting for a few seconds @xcite , is that the observable effects are due to the dissipation of the kinetic energy of a relativistically expanding wind , a `` fireball , '' whose primal cause is not yet known ( see @xcite for review ) . during the past three years , delayed low energy emission ( afterglow ) of grbs has been discovered in x - ray , optical , and radio wave bands ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "afterglow observations confirmed the cosmological origin of the bursts , through the redshift determination of several grb host - galaxies , and confirmed standard model predictions of afterglows that result from the collision of an expanding fireball with its surrounding medium ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "the physical conditions in the fireball dissipation region allow fermi shock acceleration of protons to energy @xmath10 @xcite . the average rate at which energy is emitted as @xmath0-rays by grbs is comparable to the energy generation rate of @xmath11  ev cosmic - rays in a model where such ultra - high energy cosmic - rays ( uhecrs ) are produced by a cosmological distribution of sources @xcite .",
    "these two facts suggest that grbs and uhecrs have a common origin ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "emission of high energy neutrinos is expected to accompany the observed grb photons , due to photomeson interactions of high energy protons with fireball photons @xcite , and due to proton - neutron inelastic collisions @xcite . in this review , recent work on the production of high energy neutrinos by grb fireballs is summarized , and the implications for planned @xmath12 neutrino telescopes ( the icecube extension of amanda , antares , nestor ; see @xcite for review ) are discussed .",
    "the fireball model is briefly described in  2 .",
    "proton acceleration in grb fireballs is discussed in  3 .",
    "high energy neutrino production in fireballs and its implications for future high energy neutrino detectors are discussed in  4 .",
    "in the fireball model of grbs @xcite , a compact source , of linear scale @xmath13  cm , produces a wind characterized by an average luminosity @xmath14 and mass loss rate @xmath15 . at small radius ,",
    "the wind bulk lorentz factor , @xmath16 , grows linearly with radius , until most of the wind energy is converted to kinetic energy and @xmath16 saturates at @xmath17 .",
    "variability of the source on time scale @xmath18 , resulting in fluctuations in the wind bulk lorentz factor @xmath16 on similar time scale , then leads to internal shocks @xcite in the expanding fireball at a radius @xmath19 .",
    "if the lorentz factor variability within the wind is significant , internal shocks reconvert a substantial part of the kinetic energy to internal energy .",
    "it is assumed that this energy is then radiated as @xmath0-rays by synchrotron and inverse - compton emission of shock - accelerated electrons .    in this model ,",
    "the observed @xmath0-ray variability time , @xmath20 , reflects the variability time of the underlying source , and the grb duration , @xmath21s , reflects the duration over which energy is emitted from the source .",
    "a large fraction of bursts detected by batse show variability on the shortest resolved time scale , @xmath5  ms @xcite , and some show variability on shorter time scales , @xmath22  ms @xcite .",
    "this sets the constraint on underlying source size , @xmath23  cm .",
    "the wind must be expanding relativistically , with a lorentz factor @xmath24 , in order that the fireball pair - production optical depth be small for observed high energy , @xmath1  mev , grb photons @xcite .",
    "as the fireball expands , it drives a relativistic shock ( blast - wave ) into the surrounding gas . at early time , @xmath25 , the fireball is little affected by this external interaction . at late time , @xmath26 , most of the fireball energy is transferred to the surrounding gas , and the flow approaches the blandford - mckee self - similar flow @xcite .",
    "the shock driven into the ambient medium continuously heats fresh gas , and accelerates relativistic electrons which produce through synchrotron emission the delayed radiation , `` afterglow , '' observed on time scales of days to months . as the shock - wave decelerates , due to accumulation of ambient gas mass , the emission shifts with time to lower frequencies . for expansion into uniform density gas ,",
    "the shock lorentz factor decreases with time according to @xmath27 .    during the transition to self - similar expansion , which takes place on ( observed ) time scale comparable to @xmath28 , reverse shocks propagate into the fireball ejecta and decelerate it . at this stage",
    "the shocked plasma expands with the self - similar lorentz factor , which for expansion into uniform density gas is given by ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath29 while the unshocked fireball ejecta propagate with the original expansion lorentz factor , @xmath30 . here",
    ", @xmath31  erg is the total fireball energy , @xmath32  s , and @xmath33 is the ambient gas density .",
    "@xmath34 is typical to the interstellar medium .",
    "internal shocks are expected to be `` mildly '' relativistic in the fireball comoving frame , i.e. characterized by lorentz factor @xmath35 in the wind rest frame , since adjacent shells within the wind are expected to expand with lorentz factors which do not differ by more than an order of magnitude . moreover ,",
    "the reverse shocks are also expected to be mildly relativistic , since the ratio @xmath36 is not far from unity .",
    "in the fireball model , the observed grb and afterglow radiation is produced by synchrotron emission of shock accelerated electrons . in the region where electrons are accelerated , protons are also expected to be shock accelerated .",
    "this is similar to what is thought to occur in supernovae remnant shocks @xcite .",
    "we consider below proton acceleration in internal and reverse fireball shocks .",
    "since these shocks are mildly relativistic , we expect results related to particle acceleration in sub - relativistic shocks ( see , e.g. , @xcite for review ) to be valid for the present scenario .",
    "in particular , the predicted energy distribution of accelerated protons is @xmath37 .",
    "two constraints must be satisfied by fireball wind parameters in order to allow proton acceleration to @xmath38  ev in internal shocks @xcite : @xmath39 and @xmath40 here , @xmath41  ev , @xmath42  s , @xmath43 is the plasma expansion lorentz factor , @xmath44 is the @xmath0-ray luminosity , @xmath45 is the fraction of the wind energy density which is carried by magnetic field , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the fraction of wind energy carried by shock accelerated electrons . to obtain the constraints for acceleration in reverse shocks ,",
    "@xmath18 should be replaced by @xmath28 . since the electron energy is lost radiatively , @xmath48 .",
    "the first constraint must be satisfied in order for the proton acceleration time @xmath49 to be smaller than the wind expansion time .",
    "the second constraint must be satisfied in order for the synchrotron energy loss time of the proton to be larger than @xmath49 .",
    "the constraints that must be satisfied to allow acceleration of protons to energy @xmath50  ev are remarkably similar to those inferred from @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "@xmath51 is implied by observed @xmath0-ray spectra , and magnetic field close to equipartition , @xmath52 , is required in order for electron synchrotron emission to account for the observed radiation .",
    "we have assumed in the discussion so far that the fireball is spherically symmetric .",
    "however , since a jet - like fireball behaves as if it were a conical section of a spherical fireball as long as the jet opening angle is larger than @xmath53 , our results apply also for a jet - like fireball ( we are interested only in processes that occur when the wind is ultra - relativistic , @xmath24 , prior to significant fireball deceleration ) . for a jet - like wind , @xmath54 in our equations should be understood as the luminosity the fireball would have carried had it been spherically symmetric .",
    "the observed grb redshift distribution implies a typical grb @xmath0-ray energy of @xmath55  erg , and a grb rate of @xmath56 at @xmath57 .",
    "the present , @xmath58 , rate is less well constrained , since most observed grbs originate at redshifts @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "present data are consistent with both no evolution of grb rate with redshift , and with strong evolution ( following , e.g. , star formation rate ) , in which @xmath60 @xcite . the energy observed in @xmath0-rays reflect the fireball energy in accelerated electrons .",
    "if accelerated electrons and protons carry similar energy ( as indicated by afterglow observations @xcite ) then the grb cosmic - ray production rate is     as predicted in the grb model [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : cr_rate ] ) ] , compared to the fly s eye , yakutsk and agasa data . @xmath61",
    "flux error bars are shown .",
    "the highest energy points are derived assuming the detected events ( 1 for fly s eye and yakutsk , 4 for agasa ) represent a uniform flux over the energy range @xmath62  ev@xmath63  ev.,width=288 ]    @xmath64    with @xmath65 in the range of @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "this result is consistent with more detailed analyses @xcite , where @xmath68 in the range of 0.2 to 2 times @xmath69 is obtained ( under the assumption that @xmath70 is proportional to star formation rate ) for different models of star formation rate evolution .    in fig .",
    "1 we compare the uhecr spectrum , reported by the fly s eye @xcite , the yakutsk @xcite , and the agasa @xcite experiments , with that predicted by the grb model ( assuming grb rate follows star formation rate ) .",
    "the generation rate ( [ eq : cr_rate ] ) of high energy protons is remarkably similar to that required to account for the flux of @xmath11  ev cosmic - rays ( the flux at lower energies is most likely dominated by heavy nuclei of galactic origin @xcite , as indicated by the flattening of the spectrum at @xmath71  ev and by the evidence for a change in composition at this energy @xcite ) .",
    "the suppression of model flux above @xmath72  ev is due to energy loss of high energy protons in interaction with the microwave background , i.e. to the `` gzk cutoff '' @xcite .",
    "the available data do not allow to determine the existence ( or absence ) of the `` cutoff '' with high confidence .",
    "the agasa results show an excess ( at a @xmath73 confidence level ) of events compared to model predictions above @xmath74 .",
    "this excess is not confirmed , however , by the other experiments . moreover , since the @xmath74 flux is dominated by sources at distances @xmath75 , over which the distribution of known astrophysical systems ( e.g. galaxies , clusters of galaxies ) is inhomogeneous , significant deviations from model predictions presented in fig .",
    "1 for a uniform source distribution are expected at this energy @xcite .",
    "clustering of cosmic - ray sources leads to a standard deviation , @xmath76 , in the expected number , @xmath77 , of events above @xmath62 ev , given by @xmath78 @xcite , where @xmath79 is the unknown scale length of the source correlation function and @xmath80 mpc for field galaxies .",
    "although the rate of grbs out to a distance of 100  mpc from earth , the maximum distance traveled by @xmath50  ev protons , is in the range of @xmath81 to @xmath82 , the number of different grbs contributing to the flux of @xmath50  ev protons at any given time may be large .",
    "this is due to the dispersion @xmath9 in proton arrival time , which is expected due to deflection by inter - galactic magnetic fields and may be as large as @xmath83  yr , implying that the number of sources contributing to the flux at any given time may be as large as @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the decay of charged pions , @xmath86 , created in interactions between fireball photons and accelerated protons , results in the production of high energy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the key relation is between the observed photon energy , @xmath87 , and the accelerated proton s energy , @xmath88 , at the photomeson threshold of the @xmath89-resonance . in the observer frame , @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92  mev , the typical observed energy of photons emitted in internal shocks",

    "the synchrotron loss time is determined by the energy density of the magnetic field in the wind rest frame . for the characteristic parameters of a grb wind , synchrotron losses are the dominant effect , leading to strong suppression of @xmath117 flux above @xmath118  ev .      during the transition to self - similarity",

    "the predicted neutrino emission depends , however , upon parameters of the surrounding medium that can only be estimated once more observations of the prompt optical afterglow emission are available .",
    "if the density of gas surrounding the fireball is @xmath122 , a value typical to the inter - stellar medium and consistent with grb 990123 observations , then the synchrotron emission of reverse shock electrons is expected to peak in the x - ray band , @xmath100  kev , with luminosity @xmath123 @xcite . using these parameters in eq .",

    "the transition to self - similar behavior takes place at a radius where the wind density is @xmath135 .",

    "the acceleration , @xmath139 , of fireball plasma emitted from the source of radius @xmath140 ( see  2 ) is driven by radiation pressure .",

    "<S> photomeson interactions produce a burst of @xmath1  tev neutrinos in coincidence with the grb , and a burst of @xmath2  ev neutrinos following the grb on a time scale of 10  s. inelastic @xmath3@xmath4 nuclear collisions result in the production of a burst of @xmath5  gev neutrinos in coincidence with the grb . </S>",

    "<S> a suitably densely spaced detector may allow the detection of several 10  gev events per year . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of high - energy neutrino events correlated with grbs will allow to constrain grb progenitor models and to test the suggestion that grbs accelerate protons to @xmath8  ev . moreover , such detection will allow to test for neutrino properties , e.g. flavor oscillations ( for which upward moving @xmath9 s would be a unique signature ) and coupling to gravity , with an accuracy many orders of magnitude better than is currently possible . </S>"
