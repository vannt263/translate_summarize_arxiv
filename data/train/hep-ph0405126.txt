    "the s - d mixing for @xmath11 and @xmath12 is of great interest in charmonium physics .",
    "if we neglect the charmed meson pair component which is due to coupling to decay channels , @xmath13 and @xmath14 may be approximately expressed as @xmath15 a rough estimate of the s - d mixing angle may be obtained by using the ratio of the observed leptonic decay widths @xcite of @xmath13 and @xmath14 and neglecting the d - wave component contribution to these leptonic decay widths @xmath16 , which results in @xmath17 . however ,",
    "if the d - wave contribution to leptonic decay widths is further included , potential model calculations e.g. in @xcite give two solutions : @xmath18 to @xmath19 or @xmath20 to @xmath21 ( @xmath18 and @xmath22 in @xcite , @xmath23 and @xmath21 in @xcite , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 in @xcite ) .",
    "the small mixing solution ( i.e. @xmath18 ) is compatible with the results obtained in models with coupled decay channels @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath18 is favored by the @xmath26 data whereas @xmath27 would lead to @xmath28135 kev due to a large positive s - d interference @xcite , which is higher than its observed value by a factor of 6 and is therefore disfavored .",
    "the s - d mixing may have many interesting phenomenological consequences .",
    "it might slightly @xcite or substantially @xcite affect the @xmath29 decay , which has been recently observed by bes @xcite .",
    "it would also have effects on the @xmath30 search via the @xmath31 decay @xcite .",
    "the s - d mixing could even provide an explanation for the notorious @xmath32 puzzle that the suppression of @xmath33 is due to a destructive interference between the s and d wave states @xcite , and it might also be useful in explaining @xcite the recent observed enhancement of @xmath34 by bes @xcite . moreover , the ratio of @xmath35 may sensitively change from 0.04 ( for @xmath9 ) to 0.22 ( for @xmath18 ) and to 0.06 ( for @xmath20 ) @xcite ) . the experimental examination of these radiative transitions for @xmath4 at bes and cleo - c in the near future will be an interesting test for the s - d mixing .",
    "recently belle collaboration @xcite has observed @xmath4 for the first time in the b meson decay @xmath0 with a branching ratio of @xmath36 , which is comparable to @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "this is quite surprising , since conventionally @xmath4 and @xmath38 are regarded as mainly the @xmath39 and @xmath40 color - singlet @xmath41 states respectively , and the coupling of @xmath39 to the @xmath42 vector current in the weak decay effective hamiltonian is much weaker than that of @xmath40 .",
    "one possible explanation is that the s - d mixing for @xmath4 and @xmath38 is very large , much larger than previously expected .",
    "if in the @xmath3 meson decay we neglect the @xmath39 contribution , which is expected to be much smaller than the @xmath40 contribution , we would get the s - d mixing angle @xmath43 from the observed decay rate ratio @xmath44 although this large mixing angle seems to be not compatible with all our previous knowledge about the s - d mixing , it is still worthwhile to test it with new experiments .",
    "another possible explanation is that the color - octet mechanism in nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) may play the leading role in the d - wave charmonium production in b meson decays , and it was predicted @xcite that for a pure d - wave state the branching ratio @xmath45 , which is comparable to @xmath46 @xcite ( see also @xcite for similar discussions ) . in a series of papers @xcite it was pointed out that based on the fock state expansion and velocity scaling rules of nrqcd @xcite the production rates of d - wave charmonium states including the @xmath47 , which would predominantly decay to the @xmath48 meson pair , and an expected narrow @xmath49 state , which could have some decay fraction to @xmath50 , would be comparable to that of @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the @xmath53 decay @xcite , the @xmath54 collision at the tevatron @xcite , the b meson decay @xcite , and the fixed target experiments @xcite , whereas in the conventional color - singlet model the d - wave production rates , which are proportional to the squared second derivative of the @xmath41 wave function at the origin , should be greatly suppressed . despite of certain uncertainties associated with the values of color - octet matrix elements ,",
    "the color - octet contributions are expected to be dominant , which are larger than the color - singlet contributions by more than one order of magnitude in those processes .",
    "for instance , in the large @xmath55 charmonium production at the tevatron , the @xmath56 states could have large rates , comparable to @xmath52 , because in both cases the dominant production mechanism is expected to be gluon fragmentation into the color - octet @xmath57 @xmath41 intermediate state which then evolves respectively into the physical color - singlet @xmath56 and @xmath52 states by emitting two soft gluons via double e1 transitions with the same order transition probabilities @xcite .",
    "similarly , the @xmath4 production in the b meson decay could provide another interesting test for the color - octet mechanism in nrqcd .    in order to distinguish between the large s - d mixing and the nrqcd color - octet mechanism in the @xmath4 production in the b meson decay , we suggest measuring the @xmath4 production in continuum @xmath5 annihilation at the belle and babar energy @xmath6 gev , and we will give calculations of the production cross sections in the following sections .",
    "we will show that the @xmath4 production in @xmath5 annihilation via double @xmath41 does not receive large contributions from the color - octet mechanism but is very sensitive to the s - d mixing .",
    "@xmath51 inclusive production in @xmath5 annihilation has been investigated within the color - singlet model @xcite and the color - octet model @xcite .",
    "babar @xcite and belle @xcite have measured @xmath51 production rate in continuum @xmath5 annihilations at @xmath58 , which is found to be much larger than the color - singlet prediction .",
    "more interestingly , belle further finds @xmath51 production to be dominated by the double @xmath41 production @xcite .",
    "the measured exclusive cross section for @xmath59 is an order of magnitude larger than the theoretical values@xcite , and the measured inclusive cross section for @xmath60 is more than five times larger than nrqcd predictions .",
    "therefore the inclusive charmonium production via double @xmath41 is particularly interesting and worth investigating . as in the case of inclusive production of @xmath51 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62(j=0 , 1 , 2)@xcite , here",
    "we will also concentrate on the double @xmath63 production for the d - wave charmonium states @xmath64 .",
    "in nrqcd the fock state expansion for the d - wave ( without s - d mixing ) charmonium @xmath68 is @xmath69 following the nrqcd factorization formalism , the scattering amplitude of the process @xmath70 in fig .  [ feynman ] is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the @xmath67 pair produced at short distances , which subsequently evolve into a specific charmonium state at long distances , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the derivatives of the amplitude with respect to the relative momentum between the quark and anti - quark in the bound state .",
    "for the case of color - singlet state , the coefficient @xmath75 can be related to the origin of the radial wave function ( or its derivatives ) of the bound state as @xmath76 the spin projection operators and their derivatives with respect to the relative momentum are @xmath77 @xmath78.\\ ] ] @xmath79.\\ ] ]    the calculation of cross sections for @xmath80 charmonium @xmath81 is straightforward . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we write the differential cross section as @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "the expressions of s(z ) and @xmath84 for @xmath85 are lengthy and will be given in the appendix for @xmath86 . with eq .",
    "( [ cross ] ) we can evaluate the inclusive cross sections for @xmath85 .",
    "the input parameters used in the numerical calculations are @xmath87 and the obtained cross section for the @xmath65 at @xmath6 gev is @xmath88 here we also give the calculated cross section for the @xmath89 at @xmath6 gev @xmath90 we also find that as in the case of other charmonium states @xcite the calculated cross sections for @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ dt1 ] ) and @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ dt2 ] ) are substantially smaller than those obtained in the fragmentation approximation at @xmath6 gev which would cause a enhancement factor of 1.5 and 2.3 respectively .    comparing eq.([dt1 ] ) with @xmath91 calculated for the @xmath51 in @xcite , we see that the inclusive double @xmath41 cross section for the d - wave @xmath92 state is smaller than that for the s - wave @xmath92 states by a factor of 60 .",
    "this illustrates the expectation that within the color - singlet model the suppression of d - wave state production relative to the s - wave state production is usually about two orders of magnitude .",
    "the color - octet contributions to @xmath65 production via double @xmath67 in @xmath5 annihilation come from the feynman diagrams in fig  [ feynman ] and fig  [ fey2 ] . according to the nrqcd factorization and velocity scaling rules@xcite , the contributions of the second term and third term in the fock state expansion of @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ expandfock ] ) are of the same order in the quark relative velocity @xmath93 as the corresponding terms in the fock state expansion of @xmath51 or @xmath52 . as a rough estimate for the nonperturbative matrix elements we may choose    @xmath94    @xmath95    @xmath96    @xmath97    here",
    "the color - octet matrix elements for @xmath51 were extracted from the @xmath51 data at the tevatron ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed discussions ) .",
    "there are large uncertainties with @xmath98 and @xmath99 and their combinations , and here we have assumed that they are equal and take the largest fitted values from @xcite to avoid underestimates of the color - octet contributions .",

    "the contribution of the color - octet @xmath108 is negligible .",
    "the total color - octet contribution to the cross section from fig .",
    "[ fey2 ] is 8.3fb , and the sum of the color - octet contributions from fig .",
    "[ feynman ] and fig .",
    "[ fey2 ] is 9.9fb .",
    "this number could become substantially smaller if we use the matrix element values given in @xcite . in any case , the color - octet contribution to the d - wave states production cross sections should be of the same order as the color - singlet contribution , because from the @xmath85 fock state expansion in eq.([expandfock ] ) and from fig .",
    "[ feynman ] and fig .",
    "[ fey2 ] it is easy to see that the color - octet and color - singlet contributions are of the same order in both short distance ( @xmath118 ) and long distance ( @xmath119 ) parts .",
    "based on the above calculations including both the color - singlet and color - octet contributions , we think @xmath120 should be a reasonable estimate in nrqcd for the @xmath4 production rate when the s - d mixing is neglected .",
    "the calculated @xmath121 production rate could be significantly enhanced by the s - d mixing if the mixing angle is large . with the calculated @xmath51 production cross section @xmath91 @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath52 production cross section can be approximately obtained by the scale factor @xmath122 , and then we have @xmath123 ( the color - octet contributions to the s - wave charmonia are small and negligible ) . if this estimate for the @xmath52 makes sense , with the large s - d mixing angle @xmath124 we would have @xmath125 this value is much larger than 10  fb , the value in eq.([dt ] ) obtained without s - d mixing in nrqcd .    however , as we already mentioned , the belle observed double charm production cross section for the @xmath51 has a much higher value@xcite @xmath126 which is larger than the theoretical expectation in nrqcd by a factor of 6 ( as a rough estimate we neglect the feed down contribution from the @xmath52 and @xmath62 states in the @xmath51 production cross section ) .",
    "if this also happens for the @xmath52 , which is very likely , we would expect @xmath127 to be the observed double charm production cross section for the @xmath52 . then with the large",
    "s - d mixing angle @xmath128 we would have @xmath129 this is more than an order of magnitude larger than the value in eq.([dt ] ) obtained without s - d mixing in nrqcd .    in any case",
    ", we see that the large s - d mixing angle @xmath128 would result in a much higher cross section for the @xmath4 double charm production than that without s - d mixing or with small s - d mixing angle like @xmath18 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the double charm production rate for a pure @xmath40 state is much higher than that for a pure @xmath39 state in nrqcd .",
    "we therefore suggest measuring the production cross sections of @xmath130 and @xmath131 in the continuum @xmath5 annihilation at @xmath6 gev by belle and babar .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath3 inclusive decay to @xmath4 , the decay rate is expected to be insensitive to the s - d mixing in nrqcd , because both the @xmath40 and @xmath39 final states produced in @xmath3 decay are dominated by the color - octet intermediate states with the same quantum numbers in the two cases and thus they may have comparable production rates .",
    "the color - octet dominance in @xmath3 decay relies on two observations .",
    "the first is that in the effective weak interactions the squared short distance coefficient at the @xmath132 quark mass scale for the color - octet part is larger than that for the color - singlet part by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the second is that the color - singlet s - wave contribution is further suppressed by qcd radiative corrections and therefore negligible ( see @xcite@xcite@xcite for detailed discussions ) .",
    "therefore , despite of certain uncertainties related to the values of color - octet matrix elements and other parameters , the qualitative features for the d - wave charmonium production in @xmath5 annihilation and @xmath3 decay should hold and be tested .",
    "as mentioned already , the small s - d mixing angle like @xmath18 is favored by the observed e1 transition rates of @xmath38 . however , as another independent check for the mixing angle , measurements on the @xmath4 e1 transitions will be also very useful . in ref.@xcite",
    "the e1 transition rates of @xmath4 were calculated for @xmath133 , and the s - d interference effects were found to be significant . based on the same potential model we now estimate the e1 transition widths for @xmath134 and find @xmath135 for j=0,1,2 with @xmath136 ;   and @xmath137 for j=0,1,2 with @xmath138 .",
    "we see that the s - d interference effects in the @xmath4 e1 transitions are essential . in particular , the ratio @xmath139 will dramatically change from @xmath8 0.04 ( for @xmath140 ) to @xmath8 200 ( for @xmath10 ) due to the large s - d interference effect .",
    "similar discussions for @xmath141 and @xmath25 can also be found in @xcite .",
    "we hope these measurements can be performed at bes and cleo - c in the near future",
    ". they will be very helpful in clarifying the s - d mixing problem for @xmath4 and @xmath38 .",
    "we first discuss about the uncertainties associated with the color - octet matrix elements with different choices from eqs.(13)-(15 ) . according to the nrqcd velocity scaling rules",
    ", we may have @xmath142 if we use @xmath143 as the input parameter , @xmath144 , we would have the following matrix elements @xmath145 then the color - octet contributions to the cross section @xmath146 can be estimated to be 0.36  fb ,  1.1  fb ,  0.28  fb ,  0.12  fb for @xmath147 color - octet intermediate states respectively from fig .  1 ; and 13.5  fb ,  0.17  fb ,  2.6  fb ,  0.83  fb respectively from fig .  2 .",
    "the total contribution to the cross section @xmath148 is about  20  fb , a factor of 2 larger than 10  fb , the value given in eq.(25 ) obtained by using eqs.(13)-(15 ) .",
    "the above results may demonstrate the possible uncertainties associated with the color - octet matrix elements , which are estimated according to the nrqcd velocity scaling rules but with different choices for the input parameters .",
    "we expect that these uncertainties do not change our main analysis that the @xmath4 production in @xmath5 annihilation receives much smaller contributions from the color - octet channels than from the large s - d mixing .",
    "we suggest performing the measurements on the @xmath52 and @xmath4 production in the continuum @xmath5 annihilation by belle and babar in order to check ( i ) if the @xmath149 cross section is as large as about 0.5pb , which would confirm the s - wave ( not only for 1s but also for 2s ) charmonium production enhancement via double @xmath41 ; ( ii ) if the cross section of @xmath130 is comparable to that of @xmath149 , which would confirm the large s - d mixing angle ; ( iii ) if the cross section of @xmath130 is as small as say 10  fb , which would favor the prediction in nrqcd .",
    "it is very likely that belle and babar will find a strong signal for @xmath149 , because experimentally belle has found a large cross section for the inclusive @xmath150 cross section , which is comparable to that for @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "if a large @xmath149 cross section turned to be the case , then one can easily distinguish between the large s - d mixing and the nrqcd prediction ( together with the small s - d mixing ) by simultaneously measuring the @xmath130 cross section .    in conclusion ,",
    "we notice that the large decay rate observed by belle for @xmath0 , which is comparable to @xmath1 , might indicate either an unexpectedly large s - d mixing angle @xmath2 or the leading role of the color - octet mechanism in d - wave charmonium production in @xmath3 decay . by calculating the production rate of @xmath4 in the continuum @xmath5 annihilation at @xmath6 gev with these two possible approaches ( i.e. the large s - d mixing and the color - octet mechanism )",
    ", we show that the measurement for this process at belle and babar may provide a clear cut clarification for the two approaches .",
    "in addition , the radiative e1 transition ratio @xmath7 may dramatically change from @xmath8 0.04 ( for @xmath9 ) to @xmath8 200 ( for @xmath10 ) due to the large s - d interference effect , thus the e1 transition measurement of @xmath4 at bes and cleo - c will also be very useful in clarifying this issue .",
