    "after experimental observation and the study of bright solitons in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite , recent observations @xcite and experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies of a degenerate fermi gas ( dfg ) by sympathetic cooling in the presence of a second boson or fermion component suggest the possibility of soliton formation @xcite in a degenerate fermion - fermion mixture ( dffm ) . apart from the observation of a dfg in the degenerate boson - fermion mixtures ( dbfm ) @xmath0li @xcite , @xmath1na-@xmath2li @xcite and @xmath3rb-@xmath4k @xcite , there have been studies of the following spin - polarized dffm @xmath4k-@xmath4k @xcite and @xmath2li-@xmath2li @xcite .    the dimensionless one - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation in the attractive ( self - focussing ) case @xcite @xmath5 sustains the following bright soliton @xcite : @xmath6 e^{ivy -i(v^2 -a^2)t/2+i\\sigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath7 represents the amplitude as well as pulse width , @xmath8 the velocity , and @xmath9 is a phase constant .",
    "these bright solitons are possible only in one dimension . in two and three dimensions",
    "they are allowed in the presence of a transverse trap @xcite , or in the presence of an oscillating nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "apart from bright solitons in the attractive case , gap solitons are possible in the repulsive ( self - defocussing ) case in the presence of a periodic potential @xcite .",
    "bright solitons in a bec are formed due to a nonlinear atomic attraction @xcite .",
    "as the interaction in a pure dfg at short distances is repulsive due to strong pauli blocking , there can not be bright solitons in a dfg .",
    "however , bright solitons can be formed @xcite in a dbfm in the presence of a sufficiently strong boson - fermion attraction which can overcome the pauli repulsion among identical fermions .",
    "bright solitons can also be formed in a binary mixture of repulsive bosons supported by interspecies attraction @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate the formation of stable fermionic bright solitons in a dffm for a sufficiently attractive interspecies interaction . in a dffm",
    ", the coupled system can lower its energy by forming high density regions , the bright solitons , when the attraction between the two types of fermions is large enough to overcome the pauli repulsion .",
    "we use a coupled time - dependent mean - field - hydrodynamic model for a dffm and consider the formation of axially - free localized bright solitons in a quasi - one - dimensional cigar - shaped geometry using numerical and variational solutions .",
    "the present model is inspired by the success of a similar model used recently in the investigation of collapse @xcite and bright @xcite and dark @xcite solitons in a dbfm , and black solitons @xcite and mixing - demixing @xcite in a dffm .",
    "we study the condition of modulational instability of a constant - amplitude solution of the present model under a plane - wave perturbation and demonstrate the possibility of the formation of bright solitons by a linear stability analysis .",
    "we find that for a sufficiently strong interspecies interaction , under the plane - wave perturbation the constant - amplitude solution becomes unstable and localized solitonic solutions may appear .",
    "we present a numerical stability analysis of these bright solitons by introducing different small perturbations when the solitons undergo stable and sustained breathing oscillation .",
    "we also consider and study the formation of a soliton train in a dffm by a large sudden jump in the interspecies fermion - fermion scattering length realized by manipulating a background magnetic field near a feshbach resonance , experimentally observed in two hyperfine states of the following spin - polarized dffms : @xmath2li-@xmath2li and @xmath4k-@xmath4k @xcite .",
    "this procedure effectively and rapidly turns a repulsive dffm to a highly attractive one and generates bright solitons .",
    "an experimental realization of bright solitons in a dffm could be tried in two hyperfine states in samples such as @xmath2li-@xmath2li or @xmath4k-@xmath4k using a feshbach resonance",
    ". however , there is already experimental evidence @xcite and theoretical conjecture @xcite that the maximum attractive force , that can be created by a feshbach resonance in fermionic atoms in two hyperfine states is limited by quantum mechanical constraints of unitarity .",
    "although there is a limit to the creation of attraction in a two - component spin - polarized dffm in two hyperfine states , there is no such limit in a multi - component spin - polarized dffm @xcite or a dffm composed of atoms of distinct mass @xcite .",
    "so , if bright solitons and soliton trains can not be efficiently created in a two - component dffm in two hyperfine states , a better and more efficient dffm for the creation of solitons could be the mixture of fermionic atoms of distinct mass , where one can avoid the problem of a possible suppression of interspecies attraction .",
    "one such system , among many others , could be the mixture of spin - polarized @xmath2li-@xmath4k mixture : both @xmath2li @xcite and @xmath4k @xcite have been trapped and studied in laboratory .",
    "the formation of bright solitons in a dffm by turning the effective interspecies interaction among spin - polarized fermions from repulsion to strong attraction seems within the reach of present experimental possibilities .",
    "here we shall be interested in the formation of bright solitons in a spin - polarized dffm of different fermionic atoms in the presence of strong interspices attraction and we shall ignore the possibility of the formation of a bardeen - cooper - schreiffer ( bcs ) condensate @xcite through cooper pairing . a bcs condensate is usually formed in the presence of a weak attraction among identical fermions with fermion pairs in the singlet ( spin parallel ) state .",
    "the formation of a bcs condensate should not be favored in a spin - polarized ( spin antiparallel ) two - component dffm with strong attraction among the different types of atoms , as a strong interspecies attraction is not the domain of bcs condensation . by choosing a strong interspecies attraction",
    "our study stays in the bec region of the bcs - bose crossover problem @xcite strongly favoring molecule formation .",
    "the solitons once formed will decay via molecule formation of two different types of fermionic atoms @xcite as in the case of bosonic solitons .",
    "nevertheless , such molecule formation is a slow process and can be accounted for by a three - body recombination term as introduced in a previous study of collapse in a dffm @xcite .",
    "the molecule formation will eventually destroy the solitons in the dffm , albeit , at a slow rate .",
    "the same is true in the formation of soliton and soliton train in an attractive bec , where the essential features of the dynamics have been well explained within the mean - field gross - pitaevskii model by neglecting molecule formation @xcite .",
    "a subsequent study including the effect of molecule formation @xcite has not essentially changed the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "hence this pioneering study on the formation of soliton and soliton trains in a dffm of different atoms using mean - field hydrodynamic equations with the neglect of molecule formation is expected to explain the essential features of the dynamics . however , it would be of interest to include the effect of molecule formation on the dffm solitons in a future study .",
    "in section 2 we present our mean - field - hydrodynamic model and its reduction to a quasi - one - dimensional form in a cigar - shaped geometry . in section 3",
    "we show that bright solitons can appear in this model through modulational instability of a constant amplitude solution . in section 4",
    "we perform a variational analysis of the mean - field equations .",
    "numerical results for isolated bright solitons are presented in section 5 and are compared with variational results .",
    "then we study the generation of a train of solitons by modulational instability .",
    "finally , we present a summary in section 6 .",
    "we use a simplified mean - field - hydrodynamic lagrangian for a dfg used successfully to study a dbfm @xcite . to develop a set of time - dependent mean - field - hydrodynamic equations for the interacting dffm , we use the following lagrangian density @xcite @xmath10+\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the two components , @xmath13 the probability amplitude , @xmath14 the probability density",

    "the trap potential with axial symmetry is taken as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the angular frequencies in the radial ( @xmath26 ) and axial ( @xmath27 ) directions with @xmath28 the anisotropy .",
    "the @xmath29 limit corresponds to a cigar - shaped geometry and allows a reduction of the three - dimensional equations to a quasi - one - dimensional form appropriate for freely moving solitons .",
    "the interaction between identical intra - species fermions in spin - polarized state is highly suppressed due to pauli blocking terms @xmath30 and has been neglected in ( [ yy ] ) .",
    "the kinetic energy terms @xmath31 @xmath32 in ( [ yy ] ) contribute little to this problem compared to the dominating pauli - blocking terms .",
    "however , its inclusion leads to an analytic solution for the probability density everywhere @xcite .    with the lagrangian density ( [ yy ] ) , the following euler - lagrange equations : @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the three space components ,",

    "however , in this paper we shall consider only the pauli - blocking nonlinearity with the 4/3 power as in ( [ m ] ) .",

    "to illustrate the formation of soliton train in a fermion - fermion mixture in numerical simulation , we consider the solution of ( [ m ] ) for @xmath215 and @xmath179 nm with an added axial harmonic trap @xmath161 corresponding to nonlinearities @xmath216 and @xmath217 . after the formation of the solitons in the axial trap we suddenly jump the scattering length to @xmath212 nm , corresponding to off - diagonal nonlinearities @xmath218 , and also switch off the harmonic trap at time @xmath207 . although the initial value of scattering length ( @xmath179 nm ) in this case corresponds to an interatomic attraction , because of strong pauli - blocking repulsion the effective fermion - fermion interaction is repulsive in this case .",
    "however , the final value of scattering length ( @xmath219 nm ) corresponds to a stronger interatomic attraction which can overcome the pauli repulsion so that an effective fermion - fermion attraction emerges in this case which might allow the formation of soliton(s ) . in our numerical simulation",
    "we find that this is indeed the case . upon a jump of the scattering length to @xmath219 nm , we find that after some initial noise and dissipation the time evolution of ( [ m ] ) generates a single stable bright soliton as shown in figure 4a",
    ".    however , more solitons in the form of a soliton train can be formed for a larger jump in the scattering length . in figure 4b , from the same initial state in figure 4a we consider a larger jump of @xmath64 to @xmath220 nm corresponding to off - diagonal nonlinearities @xmath221 .",
    "the final value of scattering length ( @xmath222 nm ) in this case corresponds to a stronger interatomic attraction than considered in figure 4a which might allow the formation of soliton trains .",
    "this is verified in numerical simulation . upon a jump of the scattering length to @xmath222 nm , from @xmath179 nm",
    ", we find that after some initial noise and dissipation the time evolution of ( [ m ] ) generates three slowly receding bright solitons as shown in figure 4b .",
    "more solitons can be generated when the jump in the scattering length @xmath64 or off - diagonal nonlinearities is larger .    in figure 4c",
    "we show the generation of five receding solitons of each component upon a sudden jump of the scattering length @xmath64 to @xmath214 nm from the initial state of figure 4a .",
    "this corresponds to a jump of the off - diagonal nonlinearities to @xmath223 .",
    "the formation of soliton trains from a stable initial state is due to modulational instability @xcite .",
    "the sudden jump in the off - diagonal nonlinearities could be effected by a jump in the interspecies scattering length @xmath64 obtained by manipulating a background magnetic field near a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "we used a coupled mean - field - hydrodynamic model for a dffm to study the formation of bright solitons and soliton trains in a quasi - one - dimensional geometry by numerical and variational methods .",
    "we find that an attractive interspecies interaction can overcome the pauli repulsion and form fermionic bright solitons in a dffm .",
    "this is similar to the formation of bright solitons in a coupled boson - boson @xcite and boson - fermion @xcite mixtures supported by interspecies interaction .",
    "we show by a linear stability analysis that when the interspecies attraction is larger than a threshold value , bright solitons can be formed due to modulational instability of a constant - amplitude solution of the nonlinear equations describing the dffm .    the stability of these solitons is demonstrated numerically through their sustained breathing oscillation initiated by a sudden small perturbation .",
    "we also illustrate the creation of soliton trains upon a sudden large jump in interspecies attraction by manipulating a background magnetic field near a feshbach resonance @xcite resulting in a sudden jump in the off - diagonal nonlinearities .",
    "this jump transforms an effectively repulsive dffm into an effectively attractive one , responsible for the formation of a soliton train due to modulational instability .",
    "bright solitons and soliton trains have been created experimentally in attractive becs in the presence of a radial trap only without any axial trap @xcite in a similar fashion by transforming a repulsive bec into an attractive one . in view of this",
    ", fermionic bright solitons and trains could be created in laboratory in a dffm in a quasi - one - dimensional configuration .",
    "here we used a set of mean - field equations for the dffm .",
    "a proper treatment of a dfg or dffm should be done using a fully antisymmetrized many - body slater determinant wave function @xcite as in the case of scattering involving many electrons @xcite . however , in view of the success of a fermionic mean - field model in studies of collapse @xcite , bright @xcite and dark @xcite soliton in a dbfm and of mixing and demixing in a dffm @xcite , we do not believe that the present study on bright solitons in a dffm to be so peculiar as to have no general validity .",
