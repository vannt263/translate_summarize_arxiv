    "in quantum theory , a measurement that provides information about a system inevitably disturbs the state of the system , unless the original state is a classical mixture of the eigenstates of an observable .",
    "this feature is not only of great interest in the foundations of quantum mechanics but also plays an important role in quantum information processing and communication  @xcite , such as in quantum cryptography  @xcite . as a result",
    ", the relationship between information and disturbance has been a subject of numerous studies  @xcite over many years .",
    "most studies have only discussed disturbance in terms of the size of the state change . however , disturbance can also be discussed in terms of the reversibility of the state change  @xcite based on the fact that state change can be recovered with a nonzero probability of success if the measurement is physically reversible  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , as a measurement provides more information about a system , it changes the state of the system by a greater degree and the change becomes more irreversible . to show this trade - off",
    ", various inequalities have been derived by using different formulations .",
    "for example , banaszek  @xcite derived an inequality between the amount of information gain and the size of the state change by using two fidelities , and cheong and lee  @xcite derived an inequality between the amount of information gain and the reversibility of the state change by using a fidelity and a reversal probability .",
    "these inequalities have been verified  @xcite by single - photon experiments .    in this paper , we present graphs of information versus disturbance for general quantum measurements of a @xmath0-level system in a completely unknown state . the information is quantified by the shannon entropy  @xcite and estimation fidelity  @xcite , whereas the disturbance is quantified by operation fidelity  @xcite and physical reversibility  @xcite .",
    "these metrics are calculated for a single outcome by using the general formulas derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and are plotted on four types of information  disturbance planes to show the allowed regions .",
    "moreover , we show the allowed regions for these metrics averaged over all possible outcomes by making an analogy with center of mass .",
    "the allowed regions clarify the whole structure of the relationship between information and disturbance including both the upper and lower bounds on information for a given disturbance , whereas the inequalities shown by banaszek  @xcite and cheong and lee  @xcite give only the upper bounds about two types of information  disturbance pairs .",
    "in particular , the optimal measurements saturating the upper bounds are shown to be different among the four types of information  disturbance pairs .",
    "therefore , our results broaden our understanding of the effects of quantum measurements and provide a useful tool for quantum information processing and communication .",
    "to begin , the amount of information provided by a measurement is quantified .",
    "suppose that the @xmath0-level system to be measured is known to be in one of a set of predefined pure states @xmath1 .",
    "the probability for @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 , but which @xmath2 is actually assigned to the system is unknown .",
    "here we focus on the case where no prior information about the system is available , assuming that @xmath1 is all of the possible pure states and that @xmath3 is uniform according to the normalized invariant measure over the pure states .",
    "since @xmath1 in this case is a continuous set of states , the index @xmath4 actually represents a set of continuous parameters such as the hyperspherical coordinates in @xmath5 dimensions as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the summation over @xmath4 is replaced with the integral over the angular coordinates using the hyperspherical volume element .    to obtain information about the state of the system",
    ", it is measured .",
    "an ideal quantum measurement can be described by a set of measurement operators @xmath6  @xcite that satisfy @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the outcome of the measurement and @xmath9 is the identity operator .",
    "when the system is in a state @xmath2 , the measurement @xmath6 yields an outcome @xmath8 with probability @xmath10 , changing the state into @xmath11 each measurement operator can be decomposed by a singular - value decomposition , such as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are unitary operators , and @xmath15 is a diagonal operator in an orthonormal basis @xmath16 with @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath19 are called the singular values of @xmath20 and satisfy @xmath21 .    from the outcome @xmath8 , the state of the system can be partially deduced .",
    "for example , bayes s rule states that , given an outcome @xmath8 , the probability that the state was @xmath2 is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the total probability of outcome @xmath8 , @xmath24 .",
    "that is , the outcome @xmath8 changes the probability distribution for the states from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "this change decreases the shannon entropy known as a measure of the lack of information : @xmath27 therefore , @xmath28 , which we define as information gain , quantifies the amount of information provided by the outcome @xmath8 of the measurement @xmath6  @xcite .",

    "this situation can be viewed as a set of particles , each with mass @xmath23 and located at point @xmath127 .",

    "conversely , for an arbitrary set of particles located in the allowed region pertaining to single outcome , an equivalent measurement satisfying condition ( [ eq : completeness ] ) can be constructed by rescaling and duplicating measurement operators as shown in appendix [ sec : construction ] .",

    "<S> we present graphs of information versus disturbance for general quantum measurements of completely unknown states . each piece of information and disturbance is quantified by two measures : ( i ) shannon entropy and estimation fidelity for information , and ( ii ) operation fidelity and physical reversibility for disturbance . </S>",
    "<S> they are calculated for a single outcome and are plotted on four types of information  disturbance planes to show their allowed regions . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the graphs of these metrics averaged over all possible outcomes and the optimal measurements saturating the upper bounds on information for a give disturbance . </S>",
    "<S> the results considerably broaden the perspective on trade - offs between information and disturbance in quantum measurement .    </S>",
