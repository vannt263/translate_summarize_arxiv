    "fermions are the fundamental building blocks of the observable universe , which , at certain level , is supposed to be understoodable in terms of quantum field theories ( qfts ) like qcd , standard model of electroweak interacting , etc .. they are , however , less familiar to us theoretically compared to bosons partly due to their lack of classical correspondences .",
    "an understanding of nature therefore requires a more direct understanding of the behavior of fermions .",
    "represented by anticommuting grassmann numbers in the path integration formulation of a qft , fermions are harder to handle in numerical simulations ( like the lattice ones ) than bosons .",
    "it is therefore desirable to integrate the fermionic degrees of freedom out ( in the path integration sense ) analytically .",
    "this turns out to be an easy task , at least formally , in most of the cases which deals with a lagrangian density that is only quadratic in the fermion fields .",
    "the result is usually a much more complicated effective action for the bosonic fields of the system to be functionally integrated by various means like a numerical calculation or simulation , an approximated analytic computation , modeling and possibly the mixture of all of them .",
    "the fermion loop effects in numerical simulations are in some sense less well understood than their bosonic counterparts in a theory at present .",
    "the problems become more sever in the presence of a finite chemical potential in lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "this situation calls for more analytic efforts to understand the effects of fermionic quantum fluctuations in an interacting system since it indicates that our understanding of the problem is still insufficient .    the traditional treatment of the finite density problems ( at finite temperature ) in statistical mechanics",
    "is based upon the grand canonic ensemble in which the partition function is @xmath0 with @xmath1 the inversed temperature , @xmath2 the hamiltonian and @xmath3 the particle number of the system .",
    "a global chemical potential @xmath4 is introduced to select , among all possible particle numbers , the corresponding set of particle numbers that are different from each other by a finite quantity in the thermodynamic limit . since only those extensive quantities that are proportional to the ( infinite ) volume of the system",
    "are relevant , the above - mentioned differences are irrelevant to bulk thermodynamic quantities .",
    "this makes the grand canonic ensemble equivalent to the canonic ensemble @xcite in which the number of particles are kept fixed .",
    "the usually calculated quantities , called the _ apparent particle number _ here , are expressed as @xmath5 is formally identical to what is called the _ absolute particle number _ @xmath6 .",
    "it can be realized that the identification between @xmath7 and @xmath8 is not mathematically warranted in the thermodynamic limit since the particle number @xmath3 is a macroscopic operator with eigenvalues proportional to the volume of the system .",
    "we thus expect that the formal equivalence between @xmath9 and @xmath8 and many other physical observables so computed to be broken down under certain conditions especially when the quantum fluctuation effects are taken into account . in order to characterize the deviation of the quantity @xmath9 from @xmath8 , a",
    "_ dark component _ for each physical local observables in a relativistic qft is introduced .",
    "for example , the dark component of the fermion number density operator is defined as @xmath10 with @xmath11 the volume of the system .",
    "the questions to be assessed are whether or not @xmath12 and what is the origin of the dark component when @xmath13 .",
    "such a possibility is important to study because some of the questions posted for the vacuum state of a relativistic system governed by certain qft are different from the ones asked for the condensed matter system in which the quantities under study like the average particle number density is finite with its _ absolute _ values playing no direct physical role in physical processes and in which the spacetime resolution ( energy ) of the observation is usually low .",
    "the vacuum state of a relativistic system , especially the trivial one , is characterized by its nothingness nature , namely , all physical observables in the trivial vacuum state are by definition zero . in the non - trivial vacua of the system ,",
    "certain physical quantities develop finite values which need to be evaluated correctly .",
    "those quantities like the fermion ( baryon ) number density and associated energy density should in principle manifest themselves in gravitational process at the macroscopic level .",
    "in addition , global quantities have no direct physical meaning in a classical relativistic system according to principle of relativity .",
    "it is expected that the apparent quantities like @xmath14 are not sufficient ones in the study of the vacuum state of a relativistic system .",
    "rather , one should go back to the absolute quantities like @xmath15 defined above .",
    "therefore , for a better marriage between relativity and quantum mechanics , instead of a global chemical potential @xmath4 , a localized quantity called the _ primary statistical gauge field _",
    "@xmath16 seems to be necessary , which leads to a local theory for the finite density problem .",
    "the functional derivative of the logarithm of the new partition functional with respect to @xmath16 at certain spacetime location does give the absolute particle number density since it is a finite number .",
    "the principle of _ locality _ has far reaching consequences in the development of modern physics . implied in maxwell s equations for electrodynamics , it motivated the birth of relativity in which it is raised to a principle that governs all physical laws in classical physics .",
    "localities in quantum field theories are implemented in most of the theories regarded as fundamental like the quantum electrodynamics and quantized non - abelian yang - mills gauge theories of the standard model .",
    "locality in the quantum field theories , including the fundamental ones , for non - vanishing matter and energy density is not , as a matter of fact , fully implemented .",
    "such theories contain inconsistencies , at least at the conceptual level , that have to be removed .",
    "locality of a symmetry generates a gauge one . for the @xmath17 invarince corresponding to the conservations of fermion number",
    ", a new local symmetry called the _ statistical gauge invariance _ with the gauge field @xmath16 is induced after its localization .",
    "the introduction of a primary statistical gauge field is expected to produce a series of new problems and opportunities .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to solve these problems and to explore such opportunities so that to develop a consistent framework beyond the quasiparticle picture using which the problems related to the vacuum state of a relativistic fermion system can be systematically tackled .",
    "one of the most important problems in understanding a system governed by a qft that contains interaction is to determine the phase structure of its vacuum .",
    "the vacuum is a state of the system that has the lowest energy that can be different from the trivial one for interacting systems .",
    "the non - trivial vacuum of an interacting system covered by this study are the ones that contain macroscopic condensation of particles in various form .",
    "it has zero overlap with the corresponding trivial one when the thermodynamic limit is taken .",
    "such a state can not be reached by a perturbative computation , which is local in nature and can only change finite number of particles .",
    "a large set of non - trivial vacua of interest are expected to be describable in terms of a set of parameters that characterize the macroscopic condensation of bare particles .",
    "some of such parameters are called the order parameters since they are indicators of a spontaneous breaking down of certain global symmetries of the system .",
    "they are accompanied by massless goldstone bosons that generate long range orders which stabilizes the symmetry breaking states .",
    "others , together with the order parameters , specify the macroscopic condensation of bare particles in the non - trivial vacuum in a more detailed way . for example , the vacuum of the light quark system ( up and down quarks ) is known to be condensed with quark ",
    "antiquark pairs .",
    "this phenomenon , which induces the spontaneous breaking down of a chiral symmetry , is shown to happen in the lattice qcd simulation @xcite and is supported by experimental facts due to the success of the partial conservation of axial vector current ( pcac ) relationship and resulting current algebra @xcite .",
    "for a system with a large mass gap ( compared to the typical excitation mass scale of the system ) , the condensation of bare particles is unlikely to occur in its vacuum state .",
    "so , for the purpose of this paper , i consider light ( compared to the typical excitation mass scale of the system ) fermion systems .",
    "they can be approximately represented by a massless fermion system .",
    "an interaction amongst massless fermions and antifermions of the right sign and magnitude is expected to generate a non - vanishing number of fermion  antifermion pairs from the bare vacuum . under certain conditions ,",
    "the number of such pairs can become macroscopic ( or proportional to the volume of the system ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in such a case , it is expected to has a phase transition .",
    "such a phase transition was show to happen to the nambu jona ",
    "lasinio ( njl ) model in the quasiparticle approximation ( the meaning of which is going to be specified in the following sections ) .",
    "it is also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that fermion pairs ( and antifermion pairs ) can condense to lead to a different phase ( @xmath1 phase ) that belongs to the same chiral symmetry breaking chain , namely @xmath18 .",
    "in general , the condensation of fermion pairs in the vacuum of an interacting fermionic system belongs to one of three categories : 1 ) condensation of correlated _ fermion and antifermion _ pairs 2 ) condensation of correlated _ fermion pairs _ ( and possibly some correlated _ antifermion pairs _",
    "3 ) condensation of correlated _ antifermion pairs _ ( and possibly some correlated _ fermion pairs _ ) .",
    "the spin , flavor and color combination of the condensed pairs determines the nature of the symmetry breaking channel of the non - trivial vacuum on a finer basis . since a macroscopic number of fermions and antifermions are pumped out of the bare vacuum in the non - trivial vacuum , it is natural to ask what are the effects on the its energy density by considering not only the contributions from the long distance or / and time interval correlated quasiparticle excitations , but also , at least partially , the contributions from some of the transient and short distance quantum fluctuations within the system . to investigate the later effects within a consistent qft , certain new theoretical concepts and tools in describing and interpreting the related physics , to which this work put its emphasis on , is proven necessary .",
    "the paper is divided into three major parts .",
    "the first part consists of sections [ sec : intro ] and [ sec : summ ] , which gives an introduction and a summary . in the second part , which consists of sections [ sec : general ] , [ sec : instab ] and [ sec : fdth ] , a consistent general approach to the relativistic fermionic system at both zero and",
    "finite density is developed .",
    "the third part includes sections [ sec : models ] and [ sec : vacua ] , in which two 4fermion interaction models for the strong interaction are introduced and studied using the method developed in part two ; some novel properties of these models are revealed using the new tools .",
    "the more detailed arrangement of the paper is given in the following . in section",
    "[ sec : general ] , the general framework used to handle the fermionic system is discussed . an 8component `` real '' representation for the fermion fields",
    "is adopted .",
    "the distinction between the minkowski and euclidean spacetime formulation of the problem is emphasized .",
    "it is pointed out that in the euclidean spacetime formulation of the problem , additional contributions due to certain quantum penetration of field configurations to classically forbidden region , to which quasiparticle approximation in minkowski spacetime can not access , can be included in the effective action .",
    "i also motivate the need for a distinction between local and global observables in a relativistic qft . the existence of the dark component is demonstrated .",
    "section [ sec : instab ] is devoted a tentative local approach to the finite density problem for a lagrangian density that conserves the fermion number .",
    "such a formalism is used to study the question of whether or not a state with non - vanishing fermion number density can has a lower energy ( density ) when the vacuum of the system is in a phase different from the trivial one .",
    "spontaneous cp violating stationary points in the euclidean spacetime is shown to exist in a phase , called the @xmath19 phase of a massless fermion system , with non - vanishing @xmath20 vacuum expectation value .",
    "it is argued that such a result is at least physically not acceptable .",
    "based on these findings , a consistent theory is developed in section [ sec : fdth ] for a relativistic fermion system in which a phase transition with particle condensation has occurred .",
    "a statistical blocking parameter @xmath21 is introduced .",
    "the question of the statistical gauge invariance of the system due to the original global @xmath17 symmetry related to fermion number conservation is addressed . to demonstrate the relevance of the theory , two models for strong interaction are introduced in section [ sec : models ] .",
    "their phase structures are then studied .",
    "the vacuum of both of them has three different phases .",
    "one is the trivial ( bare ) vacuum , which is called the @xmath22 phase ; the second is the above mentioned @xmath19 phase with fermion and anti - fermion pairs condensation ; the third kind of phases , called the @xmath1 phase and @xmath23 phase respectively , are phases that spontaneously break the global @xmath17 symmetry related to the fermion number because of a condensation of fermion pairs and antifermion pairs .",
    "these phases are further analyzed in section [ sec : vacua ] by using the formalism developed in section [ sec : fdth ] .",
    "a spontaneous cp violation is found to be present in the @xmath1 and @xmath23 phases .",

    "this agrees also with our observations since no corresponding long range force and large cp violation are observed at the present - time condition .",
    "due to the presence of a finite @xmath21 , the response of the system to external ( or internal ) excitations is different from the familiar one we have learned from the conventional approaches .",
    "when dirac s view for the bare vacuum of fermions is taken , namely , the bare vacuum corresponds to a state in which the negative energy states are filled and the positive states empty , the vacuum where @xmath292 is the state in which all single particle states with energy @xmath389 and @xmath390 are filled whereas other single particle states empty .",
    "since for an uniform system , the value of the mass @xmath158 for the quasiparticle is always larger than @xmath21 in the models considered , the presence of a finite @xmath21 in the vacuum of the @xmath19 phase appears to has no effects if the quasiparticle can propagate long enough without suffering from further scattering .",
    "the presence of @xmath21 only provides a virtual possibility for an uniform system that the local fluctuations of the fields can feel .",
    "so , it has genuine physical effects on local observables even in uniform systems according to the discussion in appendix [ app : thedark ] .    for a non - uniform system in which the energy of the operator in eq .",
    "[ eigeneq2 ] could be smaller than @xmath21 , the presence of @xmath21 may has a real effect on the dynamical processes .",
    "for example , in a chiral soliton in which the energy of the lowest orbits for the valence fermions moves with the size of the soliton , the presence of @xmath21 will limit the range of change of the soliton s possible size which gives an extra stability of such solitons .    to put the above argumentation in a more concrete context ,",
    "let us consider a situation in which the lowest energy valence fermion state lies within the region @xmath391 for one size and shape , then a change in its size or shape that moves @xmath95 upward can be continued freely only until @xmath392 since the @xmath393 states are filled and the next available state is the one with energy @xmath394 , which can only be reached by a discontinuous change in the size and shape of the soliton .",

    "the question of whether or not there is a condensation of statistical mono - poles in these two phases , which is discussed in a general term in subsection [ subsec : more ] should be studied in future more detailed works .      in the above discussion",
    "it can be seen that in the @xmath19 , @xmath1 and @xmath23 phases , either @xmath21 or @xmath130 ( it is equivalent to @xmath404 ) is nonvanishing . from the discussion presented in the subsection [ subsec : more ] , it can be concluded that there is no long range order for the time component of the primary statistical gauge field @xmath136 at long distances or @xmath179 corresponds to at most a massive excitation in the non - trivial vacuum discussed in this paper .",
    "the situation for the spatial component of @xmath136 is different between the @xmath19 and @xmath1 or @xmath23 phases . in the @xmath19 phase ,",
    "the excitation related to @xmath136 is short ranged . in the @xmath1 and @xmath23 phases , the excitations related to are long ranged .",
    "these excitations can therefore generate a statistical `` magnetic force '' between different particles within the @xmath1 or @xmath23 phases of the vacuum .",
    "the consequences of such a statistical `` magnetic force '' on the evolution of the system is worthy of studying .",
    "it is found that at least three interwinding new theoretical elements are necessary to be brought into a consistent treatment of the problem .",
    "the first one is the general existence of the so called _ dark component _ in an interacting system originated from the transient and short distance quantum fluctuations of the system , which is measured by the difference between the absolute value and the apparent value of some conserved quantities like the baryon number density , energy density , etc . of the system .",
    "the second one is related to the recognition of the existence of the so called _ blocking effects _ in the non - trivial phases of a system .",
    "the third one is related to the necessity of introducing a _ primary statistical gauge field _ coupled to the fermion ( baryon ) number current density of the system . by introducing these three elements into the formulation of the problem , the door to go beyond the physical pictures limited by the approximated concept of quasiparticles is open , which allows us to explore new physical possibilities .",
    "a systematic path integration formalism for the investigation of the quantum aspects of an interacting fermion system ( or sector ) sampled by euclidean spacetime stationary configurations in which a condensation of fermion pairs ( fermion pairs , antifermion pairs , and fermion  antifermion pairs ) is present is developed based upon the asymptotic grand canonic ensemble .",
    "two statistical parameters , namely the primary statistical gauge field @xmath136 and the statistical blocking parameter @xmath21 are introduced to allow a finer characterization of the vacuum structure of the system .",
    "in addition , it is shown that the asymptotic grand canonic ensemble reduces to the grand canonic ensemble as the spacetime resolution of observation is sufficiently lowered .",
    "such a behavior is a necessary condition for the usefulness of describing the macroscopic properties of an interacting system in terms of particles in certain domain of energy and for the smooth approach to the well established results in non - relativistic condensed matter systems at low energies .",
    "combined with the euclidean approach to the effective action , some of the quantum effects that survive the thermodynamic limit can be included .",
    "the present approach , which uses quantum field theoretical language , is consistent with thermodynamics and can be extended to finite temperature case @xcite .",
    "firstly , the dark component for local observables like the fermion number density does exist in interacting theories in which the direct association of the field theoretic definition of fermion number density with the number of `` free particles '' per unit volume becomes obscure especially when a phase transition inside the system has occurred .",
    "this conclusion is also applicable to other local observables like the energy density , which may have implications on the dark matter problem in cosmology since it implies that the apparent matterless space at the macroscopic level is capable of revealing itself of matter effects in low energy gravitational processes when @xmath130 is below the baryonic particle production threshold even after the energy density for the @xmath164 state is subtracted .",
    "this is because gravitational fields couple _ locally _ to the source matter fields which contain the random quantum fluctuation generated dark component .",
    "further researches in that direction in the context of understanding the cosmological baryogenesis and dark matter problem is an interesting direction to be explored .",
    "in addition , the picture that a nucleon is made of three valence quarks ( quasiparticles ) need to be modified when there is additional close - by virtual phases for the hadronic vacuum state that has slightly higher energy density than the actual one",
    ". the implications of such a finding can be explored in observables related to a nucleon . some of them are studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , other related problems concerning a nucleon , like the understanding of the origin of the gottfried sum rule violation in deep inelastic scattering confirmed in a recent measurement @xcite , the small - x behavior of nucleon structure functions in deep inelastic scattering @xcite , etc ..    secondly , it is important to take into account the fermionic blocking effects due to the presence of a macroscopic population of bare particles in the nontrivial vacuum phases of a system .",
    "the blocking effects are generally included in the theory by introducing the statistical blacking parameter @xmath21 , which is non - zero for a system s certain vacuum phases .",
    "the effects of the blocking can not be progressively generated using perturbative expansion starting from a field configuration with @xmath215 . in the @xmath19 phase of the strong interaction vacuum discussed here , @xmath215 configurations are inconsistent ones since it is known that the @xmath19 phase of the strong interaction vacuum is macroscopically populated with the current quarks and antiquarks , which changes the available states for an current quark due to pauli principle .",
    "the discovery of the blocking effects has hitherto unnoticed implications related to , e.g. , the stability of a nucleon in a nucleus and nuclear matter , the mechanism for particle production in a heavy ion collision , new ways of ( quasi)particle dissipation in a strong interacting system , etc ..    thirdly , the statistical gauge degrees of freedom of the system represents certain collective mode of the system that has a dynamics of its own .",
    "there are two components for the primary statistical gauge field : the first one is the classical configurations which serves as a background field ; the second one is the local fluctuations of it around the classical configurations .",
    "the classical configurations , which is a spacetime independent background @xmath136 in the case studied here , play the role of the chemical potential in the the conventional non - relativistic approach .",
    "it determines the asymptotic grand canonic ensemble of the system .",
    "it can also has non - trivial topological configurations corresponding to different quantized statistical `` magnetic flux '' which can determine the phase structure of the system on a finer basis .",
    "once present , the statistical `` magnetic field '' affects the dynamical evolution of the system that can result in 1 ) material pattern formation and 2 ) providing the seed for the galactic magnetic field in the early universe . whether or not such an idea is actually relevant to comprehend",
    "what happened in the the early universe can be studied in further works .",
    "the local fluctuations of it around the background extended configuration represent the corresponding dynamical excitations of the system .",
    "the necessary condition for the existence of long range statistical gauge correlation in various possible phases of the system is discussed .",
    "the statistical gauge degrees of freedom are also introduced in condensed matter physics in the context of the half filled hubbard model , which serves as one of the prefered models that is expected to describe the phenomena of `` high temperature superconductivity '' in certain matterials @xcite .",
    "the motiviation for introducing the statistical gauge degrees of freedom there is quite different from the ones in this work . here",
    ", the statistical gauge degrees of freedom are introduced _ a priori _ based upon locality and lorentz invariance with the intention of describing the relativistic fermionic systems . since the approach in this paper is applicable to all fermionic system , it is quite interesting to see whether the non - relativistic reduction of the problem can lead to some form of statistical gauge degrees of freedom for condensed matter systems at low energies , including the ones that hubbard model describes .",
    "nevertheless , many techniques in treating the statistical gauge degrees of freedom in condensed matter physics are expected to be applicable or a least adaptable here .",
    "one of the differences at formal level between the approach here and the ones used in condensed matter physics manifests in the different criterion for the selection of physical states within the full representing hilbert space of the problem .",
    "the physical states in the statistical gauge theories developed so far in condensed matter physics is invariant under infinitesimal local gauge transformations , which is realized by the requirement that the operator form of the `` gauss law '' annihilates all physical states in the superselection sector of the hilbert space @xcite .",
    "such a strict enforcement of the statistical gauge invariance on the physical state vector of the system is neither necessary nor desirable for the statistical gauge invariant systems since it would exclude all finite density state from the physical sector of the system if one requires that the statistical `` electric field '' ( denoted by @xmath398 here ) is finite .",
    "such a situations is certainly unacceptable .",
    "albeit this embarrassment can be circumvented in the 2 + 1 dimension @xcite , it is not expected to be easily implemented in higher dimensions . for the statistical gauge transformations , the statistical gauge invariance can be implemented by a imposing a less restrictive conditions on the physical superselection sector of the hilbert space . instead of requiring that the physical states are invariant under the gauge transformation , the gauge invariance on observables can be implemented by requiring that all states in a physical superselection sector of the hilbert space change a ( coordinate dependent ) _ common phase_. the mathematical form for such a requirement is represented by eq .",
    "[ q - eigenstate ] .",
    "the physical superselection sectors are then a functional determined by the common function @xmath253 . with such a generalization of the `` gauss law '' for the theory , both the requirements of the finiteness of the statistical `` electric field '' @xmath398 and of the fact that finite density states are actually physical states can be met consistently .    the formalism",
    "is then applied to two half bosonized model lagrangian densities .",
    "four possible phases for the vacuum state of the interacting relativistic chiral symmetric systems are found .",
    "the first phase , called the @xmath22 phase , correspond to the bare vacuum state of the system .",
    "antifermion pairs condense in the second phase , named the @xmath19 phase , of its vacuum .",
    "the @xmath19 phase has the following properties : 1 ) the chiral @xmath305 symmetry of the lagrangian density of the system is spontaneously broken down to a @xmath349 symmetry 2 ) the baryon number density is zero 3 ) statistical blocking effects exists 4 ) the statistical gauge correlation is short ranged due to the presence of the statistical blocking effects .",
    "the third and fourth possible phases of the vacuum are called the @xmath23 phase and @xmath1 phase respectively .",
    "fermion pairs and antifermion pairs condense in the @xmath23 and @xmath1 phases .",
    "it is found that in these two phases of the vacuum : 1 ) the original chiral @xmath305 symmetry of the lagrangian density of the system remains unbroken in the @xmath23 phase and is spontaneously broken down to a @xmath349 symmetry in the @xmath1 phase 2 ) the baryon number density is different from zero or can be locally generated by separating fermion and antifermion rich region spontaneously 3 ) the @xmath17 symmetry corresponding to electromagnetism is spontaneously broken down to generate `` massive photon '' excitations ( see @xcite ) 4 ) no statistical blocking effects in these two phases 5 ) the spatial components of the statistical gauge excitation is long ranged ; the quantum fluctuation in the time component of the primary statistical gauge field is gaussian damped 6 ) off diagonal long range order exists in these two phases to give rise to macroscopic quantum behavior for the system , which is suppressed in the normal phase of the system .",
    "the implication of the finding presented in this paper on physical processes of strong interaction phenomena that are currently being or going to be observed or are in need to be explained theoretically remains to be investigated in the future .",
