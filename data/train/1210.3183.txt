    "in this paper , we consider the problem of computing reliable approximations of a given set @xmath2 . the set @xmath0 is assumed to have a complicated shape ( e.g.  nonconvex , non - connected ) , expressed in terms of semialgebraic conditions , and we seek for approximations which should i )",
    "be easy computable and ii ) have a simple description .",
    "the problem of deriving reliable approximations of overly complicated sets by means of simpler geometrical shapes has a long history , and it arises in many research fields related to optimization , system identification and control .    in particular , _ outer bounding sets _ , i.e.  approximations that are guaranteed to contain the set @xmath3 , are widespread in the technical literature , and they find several applications in robust control and filtering . for instance , set - theoretic state estimators for uncertain discrete - time nonlinear dynamic systems have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "these strategies adopt a set - membership approach @xcite , and construct compact sets that are guaranteed to bound the systems states which are consistent with the measured output and the norm - bounded uncertainty . outer approximation",
    "also arise in the context of robust fault detection problems ( e.g. , see @xcite ) and of reachability analysis of nonlinear and/or hybrid systems @xcite .    similarly ,",
    "approximations are employed in nonlinear programming @xcite , in the solution of design centering problems @xcite and for fixed - order controller design @xcite .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite have proposed an approach based on randomization , which constructs convex approximations of generic nonconvex sets which are neither inner nor outer , but they enjoy some specific probabilistic properties . in this context",
    ", an approximation is considered to be reliable if it contains `` most '' of the points in @xmath0 with prescribed high probability .",
    "the key tool in this framework is the generation of random samples inside @xmath0 , and the construction of a convex set containing these samples .    in all the approaches listed above ,",
    "several geometric figures have been adopted as approximating sets .",
    "the application of ellipsoidal sets to the state estimation problem has been introduced in the pioneering work @xcite and used by many different authors from then on ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the use of polyhedrons was proposed in @xcite to obtain an increased estimation accuracy , while zonotopes have been also recently studied in @xcite .",
    "more recent works , like for instance @xcite , employ sets defined by semialgebraic conditions .",
    "in particular , in @xcite the authors use polynomial sum - of - squares ( sos ) programming , a particular class of sdp , to address the problem of fitting given data with a convex polynomial , seen as a natural extension of quadratic polynomials and ellipsoids .",
    "convexity of the polynomial is ensured by enforcing that its hessian is matrix sos , and volume minimisation is indirectly enforced by increasing the curvature of the polynomial . in @xcite",
    "the authors propose moment relaxations for the separation and covering problems with semialgebraic sets , thereby also extending the classical ellipsoidal sets used in data fitting problems .",
    "our contribution is to extend further these works to cope with volume minimization of arbitrary ( e.g. non - convex , non - connected , higher degree ) semialgebraic sets containing a given semialgebraic set ( e.g. a union of points ) .",
    "since there is no analytic formula for the volume of a semialgebraic set , in terms of the coefficients of the polynomials defining the set , we have no hope to solve this optimization problem globally .",
    "instead , we describe and justify analytically and geometrically a computationally tractable heuristic based on @xmath1-norm or trace minimization .",
    "given a compact basic semialgebraic set @xmath4 where @xmath5 are real multivariate polynomials , we want to compute a polynomial sublevel set @xmath6 of minimum volume that contains @xmath0 .",
    "set @xmath7 is modeled by a polynomial @xmath8 belonging to @xmath9 , the vector space of multivariate real polynomials of degree less than or equal to @xmath10 . in other words , we want to solve the following optimization problem : @xmath11 in the above problem @xmath12 is the volume or lebesgue measure of set @xmath7 and @xmath13 is the indicator function , equal to one when @xmath14 and zero otherwise .    note that , typically , the set @xmath0 has a complicated description in terms of polynomials @xmath15 ( e.g. coming from physical measurements and/or estimations ) and set @xmath7 has a simple description ( in the sense that the degree of @xmath8 is small , say less than 10 ) .",
    "minimization of the volume of @xmath7 means that we want @xmath7 to capture most of the geometric features of @xmath0 .    if @xmath0 is convex and @xmath8 is quadratic , then the infimum of problem ( [ opt ] ) is attained , and there is a unique ( convex ) ellipsoid @xmath7 of minimum volume that contains @xmath0 , called lwner - john ellipsoid .",
    "it can be computed by convex optimization , see e.g. @xcite .    in general , without convexity assumptions on @xmath0 , a solution to problem ( [ opt ] )",
    "is not unique .",
    "there is also no guarantee that the computed set @xmath7 is convex .",
    "optimization problem ( [ opt ] ) is nonlinear and semi - infinite , in the sense that we optimize over the finite - dimensional vector space @xmath9 but subject to an infinite number of constraints ( to cope with set inclusions ) .",
    "if we denote by @xmath16 a ( column vector ) basis of monomials of degree up to @xmath10 , we can write @xmath17 where @xmath8 is a vector of coefficients of given size . in vector space @xmath9 ,",
    "the set @xmath18 is by definition the polar of the bounded set @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a constant chosen sufficiently large so that all vectors @xmath21 have norm less than @xmath22 . as the polar of a",
    "compact set whose interior contains the origin , set @xmath23 is compact , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it follows that the feasible set of problem ( [ opt ] ) is compact , and since the objective function is continuous , the infimum in problem ( [ opt ] ) is attained .",
    "in this section it is assumed that @xmath8 is a nonnegative homogeneous polynomial , or form , of even degree @xmath24 in @xmath25 variables . under this restriction , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.4 ) it is proved that the volume function @xmath26 is convex in @xmath8 .",
    "the proof of this statement relies on the striking observation @xcite that @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a constant depending only on @xmath10 .",
    "note also that boundedness of @xmath7 implies that @xmath8 is nonnegative , since if there is a point @xmath29 such that @xmath30 , and hence @xmath31 , then by homogeneity of @xmath8 it follows that @xmath32 for all @xmath33 and hence @xmath34 for all @xmath33 which contradicts boundedness of @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that problem ( [ opt ] ) , once restricted to nonnegative forms , is a convex optimization problem .    in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.4 ) explicit expressions are given for the first and second order derivatives of the volume function , in terms of the moments @xmath35 for @xmath36 , @xmath37 . in an iterative algorithm solving convex problem ( [ opt ] )",
    ", one should then be able to compute repeatedly and quickly integrals of this kind , arguably a difficult task .",
    "when @xmath8 is not homogeneous , we do not know under which conditions on @xmath8 the volume function @xmath7 is convex in @xmath8 .",
    "motivated by these considerations , in the remainder of the paper we propose a simpler approach to solving problem ( [ opt ] ) which is not restricted to forms , and which does not require the potentially intricate numerical computation of moments ( [ mom ] ) .",
    "our approach is however only a heuristic , in the sense that we do not provide guarantees of solving problem ( [ opt ] ) globally .",
    "let us write @xmath7 as a polynomial superlevel set @xmath38 with polynomial @xmath39 expressed as a quadratic form in a given ( column vector ) basis @xmath40 of monomials of degree up to @xmath41 , with symmetric gram matrix @xmath42 .",
    "then , optimization problem ( [ opt ] ) reads @xmath43 note that in problem ( [ optp ] ) we can indifferently optimize over coefficients of @xmath44 or coefficients of matrix @xmath42 , since they are related linearly via constraint ( [ gram ] ) .",
    "since @xmath0 is compact by assumption and @xmath45 is compact for problem ( [ optp ] ) to have a finite minimum , we suppose that we are given a compact semialgebraic set @xmath46 such that @xmath47 and hence @xmath48 the particular choice of polynomials @xmath49 will be specified later on .",
    "now , observe that by definition @xmath50 and hence , integrating both sides we get @xmath51 an inequality known as chebyshev s inequality , widely used in probability , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "if polynomial @xmath44 is nonnegative on @xmath52 then the above left - hand side is the @xmath1-norm of @xmath44 , and the inequality becomes @xmath53    now consider the following @xmath1-norm minimization problem : @xmath54    [ cvg ] the minimum of problem ( [ l1 ] ) monotonically converges from above to the minimum of problem ( [ optp ] ) , i.e. @xmath55 for all @xmath10 , and @xmath56 .",
    "the graph of polynomial @xmath44 lies above @xmath57 , the indicator function of set @xmath0 , while being nonnegative on @xmath52 , so minimizing the @xmath1-norm of @xmath44 on @xmath52 yields an upper approximation of @xmath57 .",
    "monotonicity of the sequence @xmath58 follows immediately since polynomials of degree @xmath59 include polynomials of degree @xmath10 .",
    "when its degree increases , @xmath44 converges in @xmath1-norm to @xmath57 , hence @xmath60 converges to @xmath61 .",
    "the convergence is pointwise almost everywhere , and almost uniform , but not uniform since @xmath57 is discontinuous on @xmath52 .",
    "note that this @xmath1-norm minimization approach was originally proposed in @xcite to compute numerically the volume and moments of a semialgebraic set .",
    "in this section we give a geometric interpretation of problem ( [ l1 ] ) .",
    "first note that the objective function reads @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the matrix of moments of the lebesgue measure on @xmath52 in basis @xmath64 . in equation ( [ gram ] ) if the basis is chosen such that its entries are orthonormal w.r.t .",
    "the ( scalar product induced by the ) lebesgue measure on @xmath52 , then @xmath65 is the identity matrix and inequality ( [ cheb ] ) becomes @xmath66 which indicates that , under the above constraints , minimizing the trace of the gram matrix @xmath42 entails minimizing the volume of @xmath45 .",

    "this is the case e.g. if @xmath70 is a box .",
    ".1 in    note that , in the case of quadratic polynomials , i.e. @xmath71 , we retrieve the classical trace heuristic used for volume minimization , see e.g. @xcite . if @xmath72^n$ ] then the basis @xmath73 is orthonormal w.r.t .",
    "the lebesgue measure on @xmath70 and @xmath74 .",
    "the constraint that @xmath44 is nonnegative on @xmath75 implies that the curvature of the boundary of @xmath45 is nonnegative , hence that @xmath45 is convex .",
    ".1 in    in @xcite , the authors restricted the search to convex polynomial sublevels @xmath76 by enforcing positive semidefiniteness of the gram matrix of the quadratic hessian form of @xmath8 .",
    "they proposed to maximize ( the logarithm of ) the determinant of the gram matrix , justifying this choice by explaining that this increases the curvature of the polynomial sublevel set along all directions , and hence minimizes the volume . supported by lemma [ cvg ] and the above discussion , we came to the consistent conclusion that minimizing the trace of the gram matrix of @xmath44 , that is , maximizing the trace of the gram matrix of @xmath8 , is a relevant heuristic for volume minimization .",
    "note however that in our approach _ we do not enforce convexity _ of @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath77 is a general semialgebraic set then we must ensure that polynomial @xmath78 is nonegative on @xmath0 , and for this we can use putinar s positivstellensatz and a hierarchy of finite - dimensional convex lmi relaxations which are linear in the coefficients of @xmath44 . more specifically , we write @xmath79 where @xmath80 are polynomial sum - of - squares of given degree , to be found . for each fixed degree",
    ", the problem of finding such polynomials is an lmi , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.2 ) . the constraint that @xmath44 is nonnegative on @xmath52 can be ensured similarly .",
    "a particularly interesting case is when @xmath0 is a discrete set , i.e. a union of points @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "indeed , in this case the inclusion constraint @xmath83 is equivalent to a finite number of inequalities @xmath84 , @xmath82 which are _ linear _ in the coefficients of @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , the constraint that @xmath44 is nonnegative on @xmath52 can be handled by linear inequalities @xmath85 enforced at a dense grid of points @xmath86 , @xmath87 , for @xmath65 sufficiently large . note",
    "that , with this pure linear programming ( lp ) approach , it is not guaranteed that @xmath44 is nonnegative on @xmath52 , but what matters primarily is that @xmath83 , which is indeed guaranteed . this purely lp formulation allows to deal with problems with rather large @xmath88 .",
