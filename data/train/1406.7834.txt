    "this picture was , however , never verified by a first - principle calculation and was questioned @xcite .",
    "it was shown that charges lifted from the star by the rotation - induced electric field form the `` electrosphere ''  a corotating dome+torus structure , with a huge gap between them and no electric current @xcite . although the electrosphere is prone to diocotron instability @xcite , it was unclear if it could relax to the gj state .",

    "besides testing the ff approximation , the self - consistent model would show how the pulsar radiation is produced , how the plasma flows in the magnetosphere and gets ejected .",
    "this problem was posed soon after the discovery of pulsars and proved to be difficult .",
    "three types of gaps were proposed : polar - cap gap @xcite , slot gap @xcite , and outer gap @xcite .    the only reliable way to solve the problem is a first - principle calculation of the self - consistent dynamics of the electromagnetic field and pair discharge in the magnetosphere .",
