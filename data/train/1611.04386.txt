    "the appearance of graphene in the first decade of this century may now be seen as presaging the emergence of a new class of materials : the low dimensional van der waals heterostructures@xcite . amongst such systems the few layer graphenes play a key role as both the most studied example , as well as a group of materials possessing structural simplicity yet unusually rich electronic properties . in this respect one of",
    "the most interesting of the few layer graphenes is the graphene twist bilayer , a system that exhibits a remarkably diverse electronic structure as a function of the rotation of the layers .",
    "twist graphene stacks , and as a prototype the graphene twist bilayer , have thus attracted sustained theoretical and experimental attention@xcite .    from the band theory point of view",
    "the twist bilayer is a material both technically as well as conceptually challenging .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "firstly , the size of unit cell diverges in the small angle limit @xmath3 , and thus a numerical solution of the band structure problem is of increasing technical difficulty as the twist angle is reduced . secondly , while all physical properties of the bilayer must be determined by the mutual rotation of the two layers , this angle does not uniquely determine the lattice structure .",
    "thus the usual paradigm of back - folding bands to a superstructure brillouin zone ( bz ) can not be applied : the twist bilayer does _ not have a well defined brillouin zone_. instead the system is endowed with an emergent momentum scale , a `` moir momentum '' , which depends only on the twist angle and determines an _ effective _ brillouin zone , in general different from the _ geometric _ brillouin zone@xcite .",
    "once the existence of an effective bz is established , the usual band physics of superstructures follows : single layer states of the constituent layers are back - folded to this effective bz , leading to a hybridization of these states and the concomitant creation of an angle dependent series of van hove singularities ( vhs ) , observed both in many theory calculations as well as experiments@xcite . in the small angle limit a multitude of these vhs",
    "accumulate at the dirac point , leading to a profoundly complex band structure consisting of a plethora of very high effective mass bands near the dirac point .",
    "the fermiology of the small angle limit exhibits a corresponding richness , with multiple lifshitz transitions found in a very small energy window near the dirac point@xcite .",
    "this electronic structure is suggestive of correspondingly rich transport properties .",
    "a fermi surface topology that changes dramatically as a function of energy @xcite , in combination with the fact that the fermi energy is a parameter that , experimentally , can be controlled via doping , implies that the twist bilayer is a material for which the transport properties are of great interest .",
    "however , thus far experiments have been performed only for the large angle limit@xcite , and theoretical calculations restricted to the case of interlayer transport@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper , therefore , is to present a systematic investigation of the in - plane transport of the twist bilayer for the complete range of twist angles @xmath4 .",
    "a fundamentally important point of interest is the electron momentum transfer due to scattering from , for example , phonons or defects .",
    "this is related to the key role of interlayer momentum conservation for the electronic properties of the ground state : electron states from the constituent layers with momentum @xmath5 ( the subscript labels the layer index ) scatter only if the condition @xmath6 is met ( @xmath7 are reciprocal space vectors from each layer ) .",
    "the fact that the reciprocal lattice vectors of the two layers are mutually rotated with respect to each other renders this condition non - trivial , and leads to the emergence of a selection rule for single layer states governed by the `` moir momentum '' @xmath8 \\sin\\theta/2 $ ] .",
    "however , with the presence of phonons that provide a momentum @xmath9 , the interlayer momentum conservation condition now becomes @xmath10 , evidently allowing for many scattering processes that , without the phonon momentum , would be forbidden .",
    "in fact , the importance of phonons for understanding the transport properties of the twist bilayer has already been observed in the case of interlayer transport where , based on an effective hamiltonian theory , it was predicted that the interlayer conductivity should depend sensitively on rotation angle , taking substantial values only near commensurate rotation angles @xcite .",
    "however , once phonons are included into the transport calculation , this dramatic angle dependence of the conductivity is removed@xcite .    we will explore the conductivity properties of the twist bilayer within the boltzmann approach where the electron - phonon scattering is very naturally included .",
    "the diverging _ minimum _ unit cell size in the small angle limit @xmath11 with @xmath12 $ ] , @xmath13 necessitates the use of an effective hamiltonian approach , in which the interaction of the twisted layers is represented by a continuous `` moir field''@xcite , an approach that , in the small angle limit , has been shown to yield excellent agreement with tight - binding calculations@xcite .",
    "we find that , similar to the ground state electronic structure of the bilayer , the transport properties are qualitatively different in three distinct angle regimes . at large angles @xmath0 the transport may be characterized by an interlayer bloch - grneisen temperature , below which the phonon bath does not possess momenta sufficient to scatter between the cones of the two mutually rotated layers that are separated by a momentum @xmath14 in reciprocal space . above this temperature , which is rather low at",
    "@xmath1  k , the two layers , even though decoupled in the ground state , are re - coupled by electron - phonon scattering leading to an in - plane transport different from both of that of single layer graphene as well as any `` simple stacking '' of the bilayer , such as the bernal stacked bilayer . at intermediate angles",
    "we find the energy dependence of the conductivity shows two sharp transitions that may be linked to underlying topological changes in the fermi surface of the bilayer .",
    "one of these is the well known low energy van hove singularity of the twist bilayer , that leads to a pronounced drop in conductivity associated with the low band velocity saddle point of the van hove singularity , while the second is driven by the creation of low energy electron pockets decorating the trigonally warped dirac cones of the twist bilayer .",
    "finally , the small angle regime is associated with a pronounced ( almost two orders of magnitude ) reduction in conductivity as compared to the large angle ( @xmath15 ) regime with an energy dependence that exhibits a very complex structure driven by the multiple topological changes in fermi surface that characterize the bilayer fermiology at low twist angles .",
    "in this section we summarize the geometry of the pristine graphene twist bilayer and describe how we calculate its electronic eigenstates @xmath16 . the method we use",
    "is described in ref .",
    "and we recall it here to introduce our notation in a transparent way , and also because we will refer to the undistorted case repeatedly when solving the more general case of a distorted twist bilayer .",

    "further increase of the perpendicular field to @xmath392 leads to a further increase in the average band velocity , however the additional significant change in the shape of the fermi surface alters the allowed scattering processes such that that the conductivity does not change .",
    "these results suggest that the bilayer may indeed form an interesting system for manipulation of transport properties by external perturbation , although it should be stressed that the results presented here are smeared out upon increasing the temperature above 50  k.",
    "we have surveyed the in - plane electric conductivity of the graphene twist bilayer in a wide range of twist angles @xmath393 and fermi energies @xmath394mev .",
    "the calculations have been performed on the basis of an effective hamiltonian for the twist bilayer band structure , first introduced in ref .  .",
    "the transport problem has been treated by ( i ) employing the model of an isotropic elastic bilayer for the phonon dispersion and ( ii ) using the linear boltzmann equation for elastic electron - phonon scattering to calculate scattering probabilities and the conductivity .",
    "similar to the ground state of the twist bilayer we find that the in - plane transport properties are qualitatively different in three distinct angle regimes . at large twist angles @xmath296 the conductivity may be characterized by an _",
    "interlayer bloch - grneisen temperature _ : below this temperature phonons of sufficient momentum to scatter between the dirac cones of the mutually rotated layers do not exist , and the bilayer is decoupled ( with the total conductivity simply a sum of the conductivities of the two layers ) . above this temperature , even though in the ground state the bilayer is decoupled , the transport problem re - couples the bilayer .",
    "in particular the conductivity , in striking contrast to single layer graphene , does not possess particle - hole symmetry .",
    "this arises from the fact that the effective moir potential that describes the coupling between the two layers of the twist bilayer ( a complex valued @xmath395-dependent field ) does not possess particle - hole symmetry .    at intermediate angles @xmath396 two sharp transitions are seen in the energy dependence of the conductivity , which otherwise presents a smooth function .",
    "the first of these transitions is related to the well known van hove singularity that occurs at the energy for which the cones from each layer first intersect , and results in a pronounced drop in the fermi velocity and hence conductivity .",
    "the second sharp transition in the conductivity arises due to a topological change in the fermi surface  a lifshitz transition  that occurs at the energy at which back - folded bands to the effective moir brillouin zone create new electron pockets that trigonally decorate the strongly warped dirac cone .",
    "the increased scattering to these low velocity sheets causes a rapid reduction of the conductivity .    at very small angles of @xmath397",
    "the conductivity is suppressed by almost two orders of magnitude compared to the large angle case and , furthermore , develops a richly structured energy dependence .",
    "in contrast to the large and intermediate angle conductivity , where features of the conductivity can be clearly related to corresponding features of the fermi surface averaged band velocity , we find this is not the case in the small angle regime .",
    "the reason for this difference is that at large and intermediate angles the twist bilayer wavefunctions are very close to those of single layer graphene , and therefore the changes in conductivity are dominated by band structure changes that the interlayer interaction induces .",
    "however , the significantly stronger interlayer interaction in the small angle regime results both in renormalization of the band structure , as well as in wavefunctions that differ qualitatively from those of single layer graphene , and indeed show pronounced features of charge localization@xcite .",
    "the scattering of such twist bilayer states by phonons will evidently be very different to the phonon scattering of states that can be well approximated as single layer graphene states , and it is this effect that is responsible for the loss of a clear correspondence between the fermi surface averaged band velocity and the conductivity .    finally , we have addressed the issue of how the conductivity of the bilayer may be manipulated by an external layer perpendicular field , finding that it is possible to do so , but that at room temperature such effects will be largely washed out by fermi smearing .",
    "future work on this interesting system should address the role that impurities play in both the electronic structure and transport of the twist bilayer .",
    "in particular , in the small angle regime in which the bilayer wavefunctions differ qualitatively from those of single layer graphene , the physics of impurity scattering may be very different from that of either graphene or bernal stacked bilayer graphene .",
