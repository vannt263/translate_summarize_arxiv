    "in 1963 dyson and mehta in the paper on the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of random matrices @xcite put forward the following conjecture @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a gaussian measure and @xmath2 is the classical gamma - function ( see conjecture d in @xcite ) .",
    "it became known as mehta conjecture , probably because of its later appearance in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "soon after bombieri observed that it can be proved using the selberg integral ( see the nice review @xcite for a history of this discovery ) .    in 1982",
    "macdonald published his famous list of conjectures @xcite , where he generalised mehta conjecture to any finite coxeter group @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the normal vectors to the reflection hyperplanes normalised by @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the degrees of the generators in @xmath3-invariant polynomials .",
    "macdonald checked this for dihedral groups and some other special cases .",
    "opdam @xcite computed the integrals corresponding to a weyl group using so - called shift operators .",
    "the remaining exceptional cases @xmath8 and @xmath9 were handled by opdam @xcite using a computer calculation due to garvan .",
    "a uniform proof , valid for all finite coxeter groups , was later provided by etingof @xcite . in the case when the action of the coxeter group @xmath3 on its reflection hyperplanes is not transitive there are two - parameter generalisations of these formulas ( see @xcite and section 4 below ) .    in this paper",
    "we present an extension of these results to some special arrangements of hyperplanes with multiplicities , which we call baker - akhiezer arrangements .",
    "these arrangements appeared in the theory of rational multidimensional baker - akhiezer functions @xcite and include coxeter arrangements as a particular case ( see the next section for the details ) .",
    "our motivation came from this theory and related theory of quasi - invariants and @xmath10-harmonic polynomials , see @xcite .",
    "one of our results is an integral representation for the canonical form @xcite on the space of quasi - invariants @xmath11 ( cf .",
    "macdonald @xcite ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the product of the defining forms of the arrangement with multiplicities , @xmath14 is the value of the corresponding baker - akhiezer function at zero and @xmath15 because of the zeroes in the denominator we need a shift of the integration contour to the complex domain ( cf . etingof and varchenko @xcite , grinevich and novikov @xcite , chalykh and etingof @xcite ) . since @xmath16 we see that ( the inverse of ) this value itself can be given by the integral of macdonald - mehta type : @xmath17 we explicitly compute this value for all known baker - akhiezer arrangements . in the two - dimensional case we use recent results by berest et al @xcite and by johnston and one of the authors @xcite . for the multidimensional non - coxeter baker - akhiezer arrangements we follow bombieri s calculation using a version of the selberg integral found by dotsenko and fateev @xcite .",
    "in fact , we use the dotsenko - fateev integral to evaluate generalised macdonald - mehta integrals for all deformed root systems , corresponding to the non - exceptional basic classical lie superalgebras @xcite . the corresponding deformed calogero - moser operator @xmath18 has a `` pseudo - ground state '' of the form @xmath19 which is always singular since the multiplicities of the isotropic roots are 1 .",
    "one can define its `` norm '' by the integral @xmath20 in particular , in the deformed @xmath21 case , corresponding to orthosymplectic lie superalgebras , we have the following generalised macdonald - mehta integral defined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . using dotsenko - fateev formula",
    "we show ( see section 6 below ) that @xmath26 with @xmath27    another result of this paper is an integral identity for the baker - akhiezer function , which may be viewed as a generalisation of the self - duality property of the usual gaussian with respect to the fourier transformation : @xmath28 in the crystallographic case the difference version of this identity was recently established by chalykh and etingof @xcite .",
    "the notion of rational baker - akiezer function related to an arrangement of hyperplanes with multiplicities was introduced by chalykh and one of the authors in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) as a multidimensional version of krichever s axiomatic @xcite .",
    "we recall that there are two different axiomatics for rational baker - akhiezer functions : the original axiomatics , proposed in @xcite , was later revised in @xcite to cover more cases . for our purposes",
    "it is important to make use of the original , and more restrictive , axiomatics .",
    "in addition , we shall restrict our attention to hyperplanes in a real ( rather than complex ) euclidean space @xmath29 equipped with the standard inner product @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be a finite collection of noncolinear vectors @xmath32 with multiplicities @xmath33 . to each vector @xmath34",
    "there corresponds a hyperplane @xmath35 these hyperplanes partition @xmath29 into a finite number of regions .",
    "we shall refer to the connected components of @xmath36 as the ( open ) chambers of @xmath29 .",
    "since any two vectors @xmath5 and @xmath37 determine the same hyperplane , we may and will assume that there exists a vector @xmath38 such that @xmath39 for all @xmath34 .",

    "in order for @xmath43 to be symmetric under the interchange of @xmath47 and @xmath51 ( see below ) , we have chosen the normalisation of @xmath52 somewhat differently from that in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the definition above was revised as follows : a function of the form @xmath53 was considered , where , as above , @xmath46 is a polynomial in @xmath47 with highest degree term @xmath48 , and with the property that @xmath54 moreover , it was shown that if there exists a baker - akhiezer function @xmath52 , satisfying  , then @xmath55 satisfies conditions  , see corollary 2.7 in @xcite . however , the converse statement does not hold true , i.e. , there are collections of vectors @xmath31 such that @xmath56 exists but @xmath52 does not .",
    "the existence of @xmath52 puts a strong restriction on the arrangement .",
    "the known cases besides coxeter arrangements include their deformed versions @xmath57 and @xmath58 as well as some special 2-dimensional configurations , see section [ mmsec]-[sectdeform ] below .",
    "it is known that if a baker - akhiezer function @xmath52 exists , then it is unique and symmetric with respect to interchange of @xmath47 and @xmath51 : @xmath59 see theorem 2.3 in @xcite and note the difference in gauge .",
    "moreover , it satisfies the algebraically integrable differential equation @xmath60 with @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the ordinary laplace operator . in terms of the operator @xmath63 the baker - akhiezer function is given by berest s formula @xmath64 where @xmath65 , see theorem 3.1 in @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to proceed to state the integral identity announced above , which forms the main result of this section .",

    "it is clear that @xmath81 is well - defined for any choice of @xmath71 .",

    "it is thus sufficient to show that for any two adjacent chambers @xmath82 and @xmath83 we have @xmath84 for some @xmath85 .",

    "it follows from the residue theorem that the difference between the two inner integrals is proportional to @xmath100 with @xmath101 , this residue takes the form @xmath102 we note that each factor in the above expression satisfies the condition . for @xmath103",
