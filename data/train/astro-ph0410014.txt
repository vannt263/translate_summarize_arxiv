    "one of the most important problems in cosmology concerns the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "sixty per cent of galaxies are found in groups @xcite .",
    "this fact alone indicates that the group environment is of utmost importance for galaxy evolution .",
    "the most recent views of hierarchical structure formation in the universe involve galaxy groups as building blocks of clusters and as places where interactions pre - process galaxies , which eventually become part of the cluster population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "due to the high densities and low velocity dispersions ( with respect to clusters ) that characterize them , compact groups ( cgs ) of galaxies offer the most favorable environmental conditions for interaction and merging processes to take place and lead to profound galaxy transformations .",
    "the evolution of cgs is believed to end in bright elliptical galaxy formation through subsequent mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , groups can be regarded as putative factories of field elliptical galaxies .",
    "this evolutionary scenario is supported by the recent identification of `` fossil groups '' or `` over - luminous elliptical galaxies '' in the x - ray domain .",
    "more than 10 fossil groups are known to date , although only a few of them have been studied in detail ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". the most likely interpretation of these fossil systems is that they are the end - results of galaxy merging within normal groups @xcite .",
    "however , despite considerable efforts , details of the processes leading from cgs to elliptical galaxies are still uncertain and , particularly , the latest stages of evolution of cgs are profoundly unknown .",
    "in fact only very few high density ( i.e. evolved ) cgs have been found to date .",
    "the most well studied sample of cgs is that compiled by @xcite which encompasses groups in differing evolutionary stages .",
    "however , none of these systems can be said to be close to final merging , with the possible exception of hcg 31 @xcite and hcg 79 which is estimated to achieve final coalescence in less than 1 gyr @xcite .",
    "the rarity of highly evolved cgs suggests that , once triggered , the coalescence phase must be relatively short . on the other hand",
    ", the fraction of fossil groups with respect to normal groups would point to a relatively slow rate of formation of fossil groups , consistent with the long dynamical friction time - scale of l@xmath5 galaxies @xcite .",
    "hence , apart from the importance of understanding the physical processes prevailing in transition objects , it is of great significance to find and study galaxy groups that show characteristics of a very advanced phase of evolution such as extremely high density and low velocity dispersion .    in recent work @xcite",
    ", we have presented a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the ultra - compact galaxy group cg j1720 - 67.8 @xcite .",
    "the group , characterized by a very high density and the presence of an outstanding tidal tail hosting a number of tidal dwarf galaxy ( tdg ) candidates , reveals properties indicative of an advanced evolutionary stage . interpreting its properties in the framework of hierarchical clustering theories would suggest that the group is close to evolving into to a single merged galaxy , although the evolutionary history of this interesting galaxy group is not yet established .",
    "in this paper we present new observations of cg j1720 - 67.4 both in the optical and radio domain and use them in combination with previously obtained data to advance our understanding of the evolutionary state of the group . in particular , a mosaic of integral field spectra covering virtually the whole extent of the group is used to investigate the group kinematics .",
    "new long - slit spectra of the central / southern part of the tidal tail , obtained at the 6.5-m magellan telescope , serves to further investigate the kinematics of some tidal dwarf galaxy ( tdg ) candidates .",
    "the star formation activity of the group is studied using new h@xmath0 and radio - continuum data .",
    "hi observations are used to obtain information on the mass of neutral gas in the group , an additional clue to the evolutionary state of the system .",
    "finally , we investigate the properties of the tidal features by means of @xmath6 photometry .    for a description of data obtained at the eso 3.6 m telescope with efosc2 in the @xmath6 bands and their reduction and photometric calibration , we refer the reader to @xcite . our observations and analysis of integral field data , long - slit spectra and",
    "radio data are described in sections 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively , where results from the individual observations are also reported .",
    "our observational results are used to discuss the star formation activity ( section 5 ) , the structure of the diffuse light and tidal features ( section 6 ) and the group s kinematics and dynamics in the framework of its interaction history ( section 6 ) .",
    "our main results are summarised in section 7 .",
    "cg j1720 - 67.8 was observed in the wavelength range @xmath7 6500 - 7120  centered on the redshifted h@xmath0 line and including [ n ii]@xmath8 6548,6583  , and [ sii]@xmath8 6716,6731    emission lines . a mosaic of fields was made by combining observations carried out in 2002 june and 2003 june at the anglo - australian telescope equipped with the integral field unit spiral ( segmented pupil / image reformatting array lens ) and a 600 lines mm@xmath3 grating .",
    "the instrument was used in nod - and - shuffle mode to obtain optimal subtraction of the sky - background from the target spectra , especially important for the faintest components such as the clumps along the tidal tail .",
    "the useful part of the array encompassed 14@xmath915 micro - lenses , giving a field of view of 9.8@xmath910.5 arcsec with a spatial scale of 0.7 arcsec per micro - lens per pixel .",
    "spectra were imaged on to the 2048@xmath94096 13.5 @xmath10m - size pixel eev chip , used in 2 by 2 binning mode , giving a dispersion of 0.6   pixel@xmath3 .",
    "the spectral resolution , evaluated from the fwhm of comparison lines was @xmath11 80 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the seeing varied between 1.0 and 2.2 arcsec during the observations .",
    "nearly the whole extent of cg j1720 - 67.8 was covered with 6 pointings of the array ( fig .",
    "[ array_pos ] ) , allowing for sufficient overlapping between adjacent pointings in order to ensure the reconstruction of the mosaic and the consistency of flux calibration .",
    "two series of exposures , alternating sky and target , were taken in each pointing for a total exposure time of 30 min on target and an equal amount on sky . in one of the array pointings , along the tidal tail of the group ,",
    "an additional series of exposures was taken in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "observations of the spectrophotometric standard stars ltt4364 and ltt9239 were made for flux calibration purposes .",
    "the basic reduction steps , involving the fibre - tracing using flat - field spectra , the extraction of the spectra , dark correction , wavelength linearization , and throughput calibration of the fibres , were done using the 2dfdr software , provided by the anglo - australian observatory .",
    "repeated exposures were combined using iraf after correction for atmospheric extinction , flux calibration , and the application of a correction for atmospheric telluric absorption bands , particularly affecting the [ nii ] @xmath7 6583 emission - line .",
    "a correction for galactic extinction ( a@xmath12 = 0.29 mag ) was also applied .",
    "the exact position of the micro - lens arrays on the target ( see fig .",
    "[ array_pos ] ) was verified by reconstructing a continuum image for each array position and measuring the position of stars and/or galaxy nuclei falling within the field of view .",
    "spectra in the overlapping regions of the arrays were checked for flux calibration consistency .",
    "flux calibration of all arrays were found to be mutually consistent and an average of the spectra from overlapping fibres was used for the mosaic reconstruction .",
    "an idl procedure was written to combine the 6 arrays into a final mosaic and iraf scripts for handling of integral field spectra developed and kindly provided by m. radovich and s. ciroi were modified to reconstruct images of the whole mosaic at the desired wavelengths .",
    "the calibrated and reconstructed images at each wavelength step were combined with the miriad package into a data cube to facilitate the identification of group substructures at different radial velocities ( see fig .  [ moments ] ) .    for an easier identification of the structures",
    ", we projected our reconstructed maps on to a finer pixel grid ( each pixel was projected on to 4@xmath94 pixels ) and smoothed the resulting maps .",
    "such maps were used only for visualization purposes , while measurements were performed on the original data .",
    "a portion of galaxy 4 including the nucleus was observed in the blue wavelength range ( @xmath7 4850 - 5470  ) , although under worse seeing conditions ( the seeing varied from 2.3 to 2.7 arcsec during the exposures ) .",
    "the total exposure time on target was 1800 s. unfortunately , mapping of the rest of the group in this spectral range was prevented by unfavourable weather conditions . the reduction steps described above were applied to the blue range as well .",
    "the flux calibration was based on the immediately preceding exposure of the spectrophotometric standard star ltt9239 .",
    "however the sky conditions during the observations were not photometric . therefore , a check of the flux calibration was necessary . since the position of the array was slightly offset from the corresponding position in the red wavelength range , the reconstructed maps in the h@xmath13 line and the adjacent continuum were compared to the h@xmath0 line and continuum maps to match the individual spectra in the two ranges .",
    "a comparison of the continuum level in the two wavelength ranges showed a considerable discrepancy . since fluxes in the red part of the spectrum",
    "are fully consistent with fluxes of previously obtained long - slit spectra , the discrepancy was attributed to non - photometric sky conditions during the observations in the blue range .",
    "a correction was applied to the blue spectra to match the average continuum level in the red part .",
    "the spectra so rescaled have h@xmath13 fluxes consistent with those measured from long - slit spectra .",
    "emission - line positions and fluxes were determined through gaussian fitting of the lines in the individual spectra .",
    "while [ nii]@xmath8 6548,6583 and [ sii]@xmath8 6716,6731 were detected only in the spectra with best s / n ratio , h@xmath0 was detected in most of the spectra .",

    "[ sn_ratio ] . for some portions of the group  namely the region occupied by tdg3 + 9 , galaxy 4 , and the southern part of galaxy 2  it was possible to obtain a ( very incomplete ) map of the emission - line ratio [ nii]/h@xmath0 . in some cases we found [ nii]/h@xmath0 slightly higher than expected for hii regions , in the range 0.6 - 1.0 , which might indicate the presence of shocked gas .",
    "the highest values of the emission - line ratio are found in a few positions across tdg3 + 9 , while moderately high values are found mainly in the outer parts of galaxy 4 , at the departure of the small tail on its western side and toward galaxy 2 .",
    "h@xmath0 measurements were used to obtain a map of the group in the emission - line ( fig .",
    "[ ha_mosaic ] ) and a radial velocity field of the ionized gas .",
    "the intrinsic width of the line varied across the objects from instrumental values up to @xmath14 10  .",
    "a map of the velocity dispersion @xmath15 of the gas ( fig .",

    "interestingly , the highest values of velocity dispersion are found in the central / southern part of galaxy 2 and in the northern part of galaxy 4 , where the two galaxies partly overlap .",
    "the broadening of the emission - line in this region might indicate the presence of an unresolved second component at slightly different radial velocity , originating in galaxy 2 .",
    "additional regions showing particularly high gaseous velocity dispersion are the western side of galaxy 1 , the central part of the tdg candidate 3 + 9 , and a region south of the nucleus of galaxy 4 , where the presence of a clump was evident from previous optical photometry ( fig .  5 in * ? ? ?",
    "the positions of 6 night - sky emission - lines were measured in every spectrum of the six different arrays and compared with predicted wavelengths .",
    "no systematic dependences of the error on the position within an individual array were detected .",
    "the median error in radial velocity ranges from 2.3 to 5.1 km s@xmath3 depending on the array considered .",
    "errors in radial velocities are known to depend on the s / n ratio of the lines used for the measurements .",
    "we verified that measured position of low - s / n night - sky lines yielded to errors @xmath16 20 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we adopt this value as an estimate of our error in radial velocity for regions where the s / n ratio of the h@xmath0 emission - line was particularly low ( see fig .  [ sn_ratio ] ) . a mosaic of the group s velocity field ( fig .",
    "[ mosaic_hevel ] ) was reconstructed after application of the relevant heliocentric correction for each array .",
    "for the portion of galaxy 4 observed both in the blue and red wavelength range , we were able to obtain a map of the internal extinction in terms of h@xmath0/h@xmath13 ratio ( fig .",
    "[ ha_hbratio ] ) .",
    "the observed ratio has values between @xmath11 3.5 and 8.5 around the center of the galaxy and is particularly high in regions north - east and south - west of the center , where it varies between @xmath11 7.0 and 10.5 . assuming a case b photoionized nebula and a @xcite extinction law , this translates into a color excess e(@xmath17 ) in the range",
    "@xmath11 0.2 to 1.3 mag across the galaxy .",

    "interestingly , as visible in fig .",
    "[ ha_hbratio ] , the position of highly extinguished regions is roughly coincident with the residual structures observed in broad - band images after subtraction of the best - fitting bi - dimensional galaxy model and interpreted in our earlier work as regions of enhanced star formation .      as visible in fig.[mosaic_hevel ] ,",
    "the entire group appears dominated by the kinematics of galaxy 4 , although , at first glance , the kinematic center seems to be displaced from the photometric center of the galaxy .",
    "galaxy 1 shows the same systemic velocity as galaxy 4 , while the systemic velocity of galaxy 2 is roughly 200 km s@xmath3 higher . to investigate the kinematics of the three main galaxies , we attempted a fitting of iso - velocity tilted rings to the bi - dimensional velocity field by applying the gipsy task rotcur , following the procedure described by @xcite .",
    "the velocity field of galaxy 1 shows little gradient and appears significantly distorted .",
    "the orientation of the kinematic axis is not clear , although the small velocity gradient observed might indicate a p.a . @xmath14 160 . by fixing the centre position and disc inclination to photometrically determined values , the fitting procedure gave a rather stable value of the systemic velocity v@xmath18 = 13422 @xmath19 2 km s@xmath3 .",
    "however the attempting to fit rotational velocities at differing radii produced randomly varying values and hence was not successful .",
    "no velocity curve could be derived for this galaxy .",
    "galaxy 2 shows some velocity gradient , but the ionized gas was detected in too small a region to allow a fitting of the velocity field and the extraction of a velocity curve .",
    "the procedure was successfully applied to galaxy 4 , allowing us to obtain its rotation curve .",
    "the fitting was performed in several steps . to limit the number of free parameters we adopted as inclination value for the galaxy @xmath20 = 50  based on our photometric analysis .",
    "the systemic velocity was determined as average of the v@xmath18 of individual concentric tilted rings with fixed inclination , centred on the photometric centre of the galaxy .",
    "this value , v@xmath18 = 13433.5 @xmath19 13.7 km s@xmath3 , was adopted for all rings during the subsequent iterations of the fitting . in the second step we allowed the position of the centre to vary during the fitting , to determine the kinematic centre .",
    "the fitted centre position changes for different rings and tends to move away from the photometric centre in a north - west direction along the kinematic minor axis , thus confirming the impression that the kinematic centre is considerably offset with respect to the photometric centre of galaxy 4 .",
    "we adopted as the kinematic centre the fitted position for the iso - velocity ring with radius 2.1 arcsec .",
    "the offset between the photometric centre and the adopted kinematic centre is @xmath11 5.9 arcsec .",
    "finally we fitted separately the approaching and receding side of the galaxies maintaining v@xmath18 , @xmath20 , and the centre position fixed .",
    "the fitting procedure was performed once with respect to the photometric centre and once with respect to the kinematic centre , only including points within @xmath1925of the kinematic major axis .",
    "this choice made it possible to include a sufficient number of points and , at the same time , minimise the contamination by adjacent galaxies .",
    "the resulting ( de - projected ) rotation curve is shown in fig .  [ g4rotcurve ] for both choices of centre position .",
    "the fitting of the approaching side succeeded only up to a radius @xmath21 @xmath11 4.2 arcsec , beyond which not enough points are available and the contamination by the nearby tidal tail becomes strong .",
    "the fitting of the receding side could be extended to a radius of 8.4 arcsec , however for @xmath21 @xmath22 5 arcsec the curve becomes irregular because of contamination by galaxy 2 , which lies north of galaxy 4 and partly overlaps to it .",
    "the curves obtained with the two different centres are very similar .",
    "however the one referred to the kinematic centre is better behaved .",
    "the rotation curve is symmetric out to a radius of 2 to 3 arcsec , beyond which the two halves tend to diverge .    in order to estimate the mass of the galaxy we attempted to fit the rotation curve ( for radii @xmath21 @xmath23 5 arcsec ) assuming pure circular motion of the gas .",
    "following @xcite we used as a fitting law for the circular velocity v@xmath24 @xmath25 where the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 were allowed to vary .",
    "the fitting was performed with a least - squares levenberg - marquardt algorithm and gave as a result @xmath26 = 265 km s@xmath3 , @xmath27 = 2.7 arcsec , and @xmath28 = 1.26 with an rms = 28 km s@xmath3 and a reduced @xmath29 = 1.9 . the fitted rotational velocity at @xmath21 = 5 arcsec , where the curve tends to flatten , is v@xmath24(5 ) = 148 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the mass within this radius can be estimated through the expression @xmath30 which yields m(5 ) = ( 2.2 @xmath19 0.8)@xmath910@xmath31 m@xmath2 .",
    "this estimate of the mass of galaxy 4 is in good agreement with the value obtained through a comparison of the observations with spectrophotometric evolutionary synthesis models @xcite .",
    "since the length of the tail , measured along its spine on the optical images , is @xmath11 28.8 kpc , a rough estimate of its age is given by t@xmath32 @xmath14 28.8 kpc/148 km s@xmath3 @xmath14 200 myr , under the assumption that the tidal tail has been launched by galaxy 4 .",
    "we note that , since v@xmath24(5 ) is only a lower limit to the maximum rotational velocity , the above estimate is an upper limit to the age of the tail .",
    "the age of the tail , therefore , suggests a relatively recent interaction . for comparison , the estimated ages of the tidal tails in a sample of merging systems along the toomre sequence @xcite range between 400 and 770 myr , the highest value being found for ngc 7252 , the system located at the end of the sequence @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the age of the interaction - induced burst of star formation of galaxy 4 , as estimated from comparison of the observations with spectrophotometric evolutionary synthesis models , is @xmath11 40 ",
    "180 myr @xcite , the oldest age offering a better match to the observations , consistent with the above estimate of t@xmath32 .",
    "fibre - spectra belonging to each individual object were identified on the continuum map ( fig .",
    "[ cont_map ] ) , and added together to obtain the relevant total spectra .",
    "these are more suitable than long - slit spectra to derive average physical properties of the ionized gas in each object and to estimate the star - formation activity of each galaxy .",
    "relevant measurements are listed in table  [ emlines_tot ] .",
    "the h@xmath0 fluxes in table  [ emlines_tot ] are somewhat different from those derived in section 5.1 through polygonal aperture photometry",
    ". these 15 - 20 per cent discrepancies are due to difficulties in the aperture definition in case of partly overlapping sources .",
    "the diagnostic emission - line ratios [ nii]/h@xmath0 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 agree , within the errors , with those plotted on fig .  10 of @xcite .",
    "in addition , a comparison of our new measurements of h@xmath0 fluxes with previous ones shows that only in the case of galaxy 4 slit - spectra significantly underestimated ( by about 67 per cent ) the total flux , while for the other galaxies the bulk of the flux fell within the slit .",
    "therefore star formation properties of the individual objects remain unaltered with respect to our earlier claims , with the exception of galaxy 4 , for which a total star formation rate twice as high as the previously determined one is suggested ( i.e. @xmath14 3 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 , after correction for internal extinction ) .",
    "an integrated spectrum of galaxy 4 was obtained in each wavelength range by adding up all spectra covering the same portion of galaxy in both ranges .",
    "we measured an average internal extinction e(@xmath17 ) @xmath11 0.6 mag , consistent with that obtained from long - slit spectra ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 2 ) .",
    "the presence of dust patches causing extinction in excess of the average e(@xmath17 ) determined for the galaxy ( section 2.2.1 ) suggests that the overall h@xmath0 luminosity and star formation rate of the galaxy might be somewhat underestimated even after the application of an average internal extinction correction .",
    "a new long - slit spectrum , across the clumps in the southern part of the tidal tail of cg1720 - 67.8 ( position angle 735 ) , was obtained in 2002 may at the magellan 6.5-m telescope ( las campanas observatory ) .",
    "this spectrum complements the data previously obtained in other regions of the group , and already described in @xcite .",
    "the 1800 s exposure was taken through a 72.0@xmath91.25 arcsec slit with the boller and chivens spectrograph and a 600 lines mm@xmath3 grating , and imaged on to a 2048@xmath9515 13.5-@xmath10 m pixel ccd .",
    "this configuration gave a dispersion of 1.557   pixel@xmath3 in the wavelength range 3780 - 6970  , a spectral resolution of @xmath11 6.8   ( fwhm ) , and a spatial scale of 0.25 arcsec pixel@xmath3 .",
    "the seeing at the time of the observations was @xmath11 1.2 arcsec .",
    "the usual reduction steps : bias subtraction , flat - fielding , and wavelength calibration , were carried out on the bi - dimensional spectrum with standard iraf packages , while the iraf script l.a.cosmic @xcite was used for cosmic ray rejection .",

    "individual emission regions were identified on the continuum - subtracted h@xmath0 emission - line profile along the slit ( fig .",
    "[ slit_profile ] ) . some of them are portions of the tdg candidates found in the central and southern parts of the tidal tail @xcite .",
    "we labelled these regions according to our previous papers ( see also fig .  [ array_pos ] ) although we must stress that the spectra previously obtained sampled different parts of these clumps , hence emission - line fluxes ( and ratios ) are not expected to be exactly the same .",
    "an additional , fainter emitting region , labelled ` 13 ' is visible in the spectrum and appears to correspond to a faint clump lying to the east of object 12 .",
    "one - dimensional spectra of the individual regions were extracted and corrected for galactic extinction ( a@xmath12 = 0.29 mag ) .",
    "once the spatial coverage of the slit has been taken in to account , the fluxes of the detected emission - lines are in reasonable agreement , as an order of magnitude , with those measured on integral field data , therefore we do not quote them .    the emission - line ratios obtained with the new spectrum confirm the physical conditions and metal abundances ( ionization parameter @xmath33u @xmath14 @xmath343 , z @xmath11 0.2 - 0.3 z@xmath2 ) already suggested for the tdg candidates , with a tendency for tdg 7 + 8 toward lower metallicities .",
    "an interesting outcome of the new observations concerns the distribution of dust across the star - forming clumps .",
    "in fact considerable variations of e(@xmath17 ) along the slit reveal an unhomogeneous distribution of dust in the southern part of the tidal tail , as shown in fig .",

    "we note that a bridge emanates from galaxy 1 toward galaxy 2 ( in projection ) and , according to the velocity field , a bridge of ionized gas , at systemic velocity , seems to connect galaxies 1 and 4 .    in prograde major mergers between disc galaxies the formation of two opposite tidal tails ( one per galaxy )",
    "is expected , while in retrograde mergers the formation of well defined tails would be suppressed in favour of plumes ( as shown in * ? ? ?",

    "although not too small otherwise the merging would occur before long tails had the time to develop @xcite .",
    "since tails are formed only after pericentre passage , the galaxies in cg j1720 - 67.8 must have already passed the pericentre of their orbits at least once .",
    "the fact that cg j1720 - 67.8 has only one long , bright tidal tail , without a strong counter - tail , and exhibits a second faint tail and a cone - like plume suggests that either a prograde - retrograde encounter , with small impact parameter , has taken place ",
    "i.e. only one of the galaxies had the spin vector ( roughly ) aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector  or one of the interacting galaxies was gas - poor . since the strong tail is actively forming stars ",
    "it hosts blue clumps whose latest bursts of star formation are likely to have occurred 6 to 8 myr ago and it is responsible for 31 per cent of the h@xmath0 luminosity of the group  it must contain a considerable amount of gas , hence it has likely been produced by a gas - rich galaxy .",
    "the most likely progenitor is galaxy 4 , the spiral galaxy to which the tail appears to be connected . as a consequence",

    "since the tail is quite broad , our observational viewpoint is likely to be approximately above the orbital plane .",
    "which role did galaxies 1 and 2 play in this encounter ? were they both involved in the interaction that produced the strong tail , and if not , which one is the close interacting companion of galaxy 4 ?",
    "we try to address these questions by considering the star formation activity and its distribution in the group .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission indicates that star formation activity is present all across the bodies of galaxies 1 and 4 ( although it peaks in their central parts ) , in the centre of galaxy 2 , all along the strongest tidal tail , in the bridges ( at low level ) , and at least in one clump in the faint tail .",
    "we do not have information about star formation in the plume , however this feature is redder than the other tidal debris .",
    "the emission in the continuum at 1.4 ghz , which is a good tracer of star formation and in contrast to h@xmath0 is not affected by extinction , peaks at the position of galaxy 4 and extends to the other two galaxies and to the tail ( with a secondary peak at its southern end ) . a number of numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite found that star formation rates in merging galaxies can be increased by an order of magnitude for several times 10@xmath58 years with most star formation activity located in the central region of the merging galaxies . in their close - encounter simulations ,",
    "both prograde and retrograde mergers lead to strong bursts of star formation . in retrograde mergers",
    "the burst begins in the individual discs while they are still separated and continues as the gas falls into the central regions of the merger .",
    "such a situation could be representative of galaxies 1 and 4 .",

    "this view agrees with the results of evolutionary synthesis modelling of the galaxies @xcite , which indicate an age of @xmath11 180 myr for the interaction - induced bursts in both galaxies , consistent with estimated age of the strong tidal tail . in this case",
    "the cone - like plume could have originated from galaxy 1 .",
    "assuming that the r - band luminosity of the two galaxies roughly traces their masses , this would be a minor merger , with an approximate mass ratio 4:1 for galaxy 4 : galaxy 1 .",
    "as an alternative possibility , the second faint tail and/or the plume are the result of a previous encounter possibly involving galaxy 2 .",
    "no active star - formation is detected in these fainter tidal structures , except for the presence of a ring - like feature encompassing the blue clump no .",
    "11 with no detected h@xmath0 emission . since galaxy 2",
    "has a de vaucouleurs bulge and a weak disc component and exhibits active star formation in its central parts ( although at low level ) , we suggest the possibility that galaxy 2 is the remnant of a relatively recent merger . if this were the case , the central star formation could be interpreted as the remains of a burst triggered during the merging phase .",
    "the faint tail and plumes could be the tidal debris of such a merger , most probably involving two relatively gas - poor galaxies ( e.g. two early - type spirals ) .    to summarise , we suggest the following possible interaction scenarios that could lead to the present configuration of cg j1720 - 67.8 :    1 .   galaxy 2 is a merger remnant , responsible for the faint tail and plume .",
    "this merger is in excess of 500 myr old , since the bulge of the galaxy has had time to relax to a de vaucouleurs profile and the merger - induced burst of star formation has already faded .",
    "galaxies 1 and 4 have recently undergone a close passage , which has produced bursts of star formation in both galaxies and the formation of the prominent blue tidal tail as well as a bridge departing from galaxy 4 toward galaxy 1 .",
    "this view is additionally supported by the fact that the two galaxies have similar systemic velocities and both of them exhibit evidence of a recent episode of star formation involving a big fraction of their bodies .",
    "an interaction of both galaxies with galaxy 2 might be underway , as suggested by the presence of the bridge of matter departing from galaxy 1 toward galaxy 2 and the possible bridge between galaxies 2 and 4 .",
    "galaxy 2 was an early - type galaxy to start with and has recently undergone a close interaction with galaxies 1 and 4 .",
    "as a consequence of this interaction , galaxy 4 launched a strong tidal tail and a bridge , galaxy 1 launched a faint tail ( retrograde encounter ? ) and a small bridge , and galaxy 2 gave origin to the cone - like plume extending to the north .",
    "the encounter drove some gas from the disc to the center of the gas - poor galaxy 2 , which started a small episode of star formation , while stronger episodes of star formation were triggered in the gas - rich galaxies 1 and 4 .",
    "the information derived from our observations is not sufficient to unambiguously establish the interaction history of the system .",
    "the above scenarios can not be proven without encounter simulations specifically suited to reproduce the observed geometry of the galaxy group .",
    "hence , at this level , they remain hypotheses that require verifying . from observational data",
    "alone , we can not yet establish what the future outcome of this system will be , although the small separation of the galaxies in space and the strong interactions they are undergoing suggest that the group will merge in a relatively short time .      as discussed above",
    ", the velocity field of the group shows a regular gradient along the tidal tail .",
    "no particular kinematic structures are detected at the position of the tdg candidates , except for the strong gradient at the position of tdg3 + 9 , already reported in @xcite .",

    "these results may be reconciled when one considers that the seeing conditions during integral field observations of southern part of the tail were poor and would thus tend to smear out small local velocity gradients .",
    "additionally , the h@xmath0 s / n ratio along the tidal tail is quite low ( see fig .",

    "= 0.5 mag , l@xmath69 = 1.1@xmath910@xmath70 l@xmath71 , we find an upper limit to the hi mass per unit blue luminosity m@xmath72/l@xmath69 @xmath23 0.02 m@xmath2 l@xmath73 .",
    "the ratio does not change significantly if the contribution to the b - luminosity of the early - type galaxy 2 ( whose contribution to the hi mass is probably negligible ) is subtracted .",
    "this value is lower than the lowest value found in the toomre sequence of mergers ( 0.07 for ngc7252 * ? ? ?",
    "this fact again points to an hi deficiency in cg j1720 - 67.8 .",
    "the bright tidal tail of cg j1720 - 67.8 has an h@xmath0 luminosity , l(h@xmath0 ) = 1.1 @xmath9 10@xmath46 ergs s@xmath3 , considerably higher than most tidal tails of the merging galaxies in the toomre sequence [ l(h@xmath0+[nii ] ) = 10@xmath74 to 3.7 @xmath9 10@xmath75 ergs s@xmath3 ; @xcite ] and its percentage contribution to the global h@xmath0 luminosity ( @xmath11 19 per cent ) is comparable to that of the knotty northern tail of ngc 4676 . hence cg j1720 - 67.8 , besides being particularly poor in atomic gas , displays a star formation activity significantly more intense ( roughly by an order of magnitude in the tidal tail and at least a factor of 4 globally ) than the merging galaxy pairs we used as a term of comparison .",
    "additionally , its global star formation rate is roughly twice as high as that measured for hcg 31 @xcite , a strongly interacting compact galaxy group having some common properties to cg j1720 - 67.8 and believed to be already very evolved @xcite .",
    "we suggest that this star formation activity is , at least partially , responsible for the hi deficiency of the galaxy group .",
    "part of the hi could also have been dispersed ( at low density level ) in the group surroundings by the interaction process , thus becoming particularly difficult to detect .",
    "in this paper and our previous works @xcite we have collected a series of multiwavelength observations with the main aim of establishing the evolutionary state of the ultra - compact galaxy group cg j1720 - 67.8 .",
    "our studies have revealed this system as an interesting candidate to represent the rarely observed phase in the evolution of compact groups that precedes the final merging . in particular in this work we have considered the kinematics of the group components  based on both integral field and",
    "long slit optical spectroscopy  and the intensity and distribution of star formation activity  based on h@xmath0 and radio continuum observations  together with the photometric properties of the whole group and its tidal debris to put some constraints on the interaction history of cg j1720 - 67.8 .",
    "we use encounter simulations in the literature as well as examples of merging galaxy pairs to interpret our observations and outline some possible evolutionary scenarios .",
    "however , the presence of tails and bridges involving all three galaxies suggests a more complex interaction than those usually simulated considering only galaxy pairs . in cg j1720 - 67.8 we have most probably a three - body encounter or an even more complicated case with one of the galaxies being already the outcome of a relatively recent merger .",
    "although other interpretations are possible , as discussed extensively in section 7.1 , we favour a scenario in which galaxy 4 and galaxy 1 experienced a prograde - retrograde close encounter within the last 200 myr . during this encounter",
    ", the strong tidal tail and the bridge between the two galaxies were formed , and possibly also the cone - like plume with the apex pointing approximately to the centre of galaxy 1 .",
    "the interaction process triggered strong star formation episodes across the bodies and in the centres of both galaxies .",
    "more recent star formation events ( @xmath23 10 myr ) have taken place in the condensations of gas and stars that formed under the action of self - gravity within the tidal tail .",
    "these condensations have properties consistent with tidal dwarf galaxies in the process of formation .",
    "although these objects can not be confirmed as real tdgs , they do show possible signs of self - gravitation .",
    "the role of galaxy 2 in this recent encounter is not clear .",
    "the small bridge departing from galaxy 1 in its direction suggests that this galaxy was involved in the interaction .",
    "the presence of a further bridge between galaxies 2 and 4 is possible but can not be established with certainty because of the significant overlap between the two galaxies in projection on the sky .",
    "our new data have confirmed the presence of low level star formation concentrated in the central part of galaxy 2 .",
    "this fact , together with the surface brightness distribution indicating a dominant de vaucouleurs bulge , suggested the interesting hypothesis that galaxy 2 is a merger remnant still showing the remnant of a central burst of star formation triggered by the merger event .",
    "if this was the case , the faint secondary tail seen on the western side of the group could have emanated from galaxy 2 s progenitors .",
    "this is also an alternative origin for the northern cone - like plume .",
    "since our data do not have sufficient spatial resolution to disentangle any possible double nucleus or other substructure within galaxy 2 , the merger hypothesis remains speculative .",
    "the proximity of the three galaxies in space and their strong interactions suggests that they will merge in a relatively short time .",
    "furthermore , several indications of significant hi deficiency in the group ( section 7.3 ) , according to the evolutionary scenario proposed by @xcite , support the idea that the galaxy system is already evolved .",
    "dedicated dynamical modelling is necessary to evaluate the validity of any of the proposed scenarios and predict the future evolution of the system .",
