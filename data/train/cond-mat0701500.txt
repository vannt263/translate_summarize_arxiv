    ", previous theoretical studies have assumed that interfacial charges can be smeared to a uniform distribution . in this paper , we investigate effects related to the discrete nature of interfacial charges and their possible conformational degrees of freedom and further elucidate how they lead to charge inversion .",
    "although , as stated , the subject of this paper is mainly charge inversion , this effect is a consequence of the spatial distribution of charges in solution , so an elucidation of the former provides a detailed understanding for the latter .",
    "therefore , the results presented in this paper provide a precise characterization of ionic distributions next to charged interfaces , which applies also in those cases where charge inversion does not take place .",

    "in the analysis of the electrostatics of charged interfaces in contact with electrolyte solutions it is customary to divide the aqueous solution into two regions , the so - called stern and diffuse layers @xcite .",
    "the stern layer corresponds to the region immediate to the interface and may include bound counterions whereas the diffuse layer consists of an atmosphere of ions in rapid thermal motion .",
    "a common phenomenological approach describes the stern layer as a langmuir isotherm with several phenomenological parameters ( such as binding constants , interfacial dielectric constant for water , etc .. ) coupled with the classical poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) @xcite theory describing the diffuse layer .",
    "while the description of the diffuse layer by pb theory is usually quite satisfactory ( almost exact in the dilute regime ) , a more rigorous description of the stern layer without resorting to empirical parameters presents considerable theoretical difficulties , but this description is necessary for an unambiguous description of the correlations that lead to charge inversion .    let us illustrate in some detail how correlations induce charge inversion @xcite",
    ". we will assume solutions with approximately unit activity , so that the chemical potential of the counterions within the diffuse layer is simply @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the salt number density of the solution and @xmath2 can be taken as the volume of a single counterion ( we note that more concentrated regimes can be described from the results in @xcite ) .",
    "the chemical potential within the stern layer is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the two dimensional number density of counterions with cross - sectional area @xmath5 and ionic valence @xmath6 , while @xmath7 is the contact value potential and @xmath8 is the contribution arising from correlation effects .",
    "the onset of charge inversion takes place at a salt concentration @xmath9 , where the contact value potential is zero ( @xmath10 ) and the stern layer number density satisfies the neutrality condition @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the `` bare''interfacial charge density .",
    "this leads to the equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the counterion radius . for charge inversion to occur within the dilute regime ( ionic strengths of the order of 0.1 m or lower )",
    "a significant favorable correlation energy is necessary ( more precisely , the correlation chemical potential must satisfy @xmath15 ) .    where the favorable correlation energy comes from ?",
    "if electric charges are smeared into a continuum , we revert back to the standard pb description where @xmath16 and no charge inversion can take place . in other words ,",
    "a favorable correlation energy arises from effects that are related to the underlying discreteness of electric charges .",
    "we next discuss different explicit scenarios that lead to @xmath17 and give raise to charge inversion .",
    "this regime is dominated by counterion - counterion correlations within the stern layer , consequently approximating interfacial charges as a smeared uniform charge density .",

    "it is possible that the results in @xcite can be described by a tc theory",
    "? the general trends of @xmath9 regarding its dependence on dielectric constant and multivalent concentration are in agreement with the binding constant eq .",
    "[ eq : bjerrum_constant ] .",
    "the strongest evidence against charge inversion as described within the tc regime comes from the observed dependence of @xmath9 with increasing bare surface charge , which according to the tc regime is given by @xmath160 , that is , independent of surface charge . understanding the observed dependence of @xmath9 on bare surface charge within the tc regime",
    "could only be explained by appealing to complex binding scenarios where counterions bind to several interfacial charges , which in view of the good agreement within lc theories , does not seem justified .",
    "we point out , however , that similar experiments for divalent ( ca@xmath87 and mg@xmath87 ) ions show that @xmath161 m , in disagreement with lc theories , which predict @xmath162 m .",
    "we point out that ca@xmath87 and mg@xmath87 have a small radius leading to @xmath163 , and indeed , in this case the tc regime predicts @xmath164 m .",
    "it is quite possible that the experiments reported in @xcite for divalent ions provide an example for the tc regime .",
    "further experiments or simulations will be required to establish this point .",
    "tc theories require that 1 ) that interfacial charges do not have conformational degrees of freedom and 2 ) @xmath165 .    a clear experimental candidate for charge inversion for the tc regime",
    "is provided by ps membranes in a solution containing ca@xmath87 ions @xcite .",
    "it is found that @xmath166 so condition 2 ) is satisfied .",
    "it is not entirely obvious that condition 1 ) is satisfied , as ps lipids have significant conformational degrees of freedom .",
    "the experiments in @xcite where done with brain ps , which contain different degrees of unsaturated hydrocarbon chains that might leave ps head groups sufficiently separated to prevent complexation from taking place . more detailed analysis , which can be provided from accurate md simulations will be required to assess the degree of complexation found in these systems .",
    "the binding constant computed from eq .",
    "[ eq : bjerrum_constant ] for ca@xmath87 give @xmath167m@xmath42 , which allows to reproduce the values of contact value potential extracted from electrophoretic measurements over five decades in salt concentration @xcitewithout any fitting parameters .",
    "furthermore , results for na@xmath148 are also reproduced from eq .",
    "[ eq : bjerrum_constant ] without fitting parameters .",
    "it is therefore quite apparent that the experimental results of @xcite are described by tc theories @xcite with surprising accuracy .",
    "it is remarkable that the same binding constants can be used to predict ionic distributions at higher surface density , such as in langmuir monolayers @xcite ( with some corrections , as discussed in @xcite ) and in diluted ps membranes @xcite with considerably lower surface charge density .",
    "these observations are in full agreement with the expectations from the tc regime , since eq.([eq : bjerrum_constant ] ) predicts that the binding constant does not depend on the surface charge density @xmath12 .",
    "is it possible that the ps membranes are described by lc theories ?",
    "lc theories would predict a much lower @xmath9 ( in the mm regime ) and @xmath25 potential values should exhibit some corrections due to the presence of the two dimensional correlated liquid .",
    "furthermore , the fact that binding constants are independent of surface charge provides strong evidence against ps membranes being described by lc theories . in general , amphiphilic interfaces show a strong dependence on the nature of the interfacial molecule , which makes it generally incompatible with the lc regime .",
    "for example , dmpa monolayers with a surface charge @xmath168@xmath40 show charge inversion in presence of @xmath169 m concentrations of bacl@xmath84 @xcite but fatty acids , with basically the same surface charge , do not exhibit charge inversion @xcite .    regarding the description of ps membranes within cc theories , in @xcite it was assumed that divalent ions bind in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio , while in @xcite , a 2:1 ratio was assumed , both experiments giving good results .",
    "furthermore , the results in @xcite show some specificity in ionic type , which is slightly larger than predicted from tc theories .",
    "although tc describe the experiments with surprising accuracy , it is therefore likely that more detailed studies will reveal some degree of complexation .",
    "complexation requires that interfacial groups have conformational degrees of freedom .",
    "x - ray reflectivity experiments with monolayers of dmpa at molecular area @xmath124@xmath40 report charge inversion @xcite at the mm regime for ba@xmath87 , and some indications that it may extend at least up to the @xmath169 m range @xcite .",
    "recent results provide charge inversion within the @xmath169 m range for la@xmath170 @xcite .",
    "if these results were described by tc , @xmath9 would be in the @xmath171 m range for divalent ions and in the @xmath172 m for the trivalent ions .",
    "clearly , the observed charge inversion takes place at much lower concentrations and is consistent with the predictions of cc discussed in the previous section .    a more stringent test to assess",
    "the prediction of the cc theory described in the previous section would require 1 ) to assess the number of interfacial o surrounding a given ba@xmath87 and 2 ) establishing the presence of a diffuse layer of co - ions ( cl@xmath88 , etc .. ) next to the surface .",
    "both predictions can be realistically validated from x - ray studies .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy from recently developed surface sensitive exafs @xcite has provided a detailed description of the oxygen atoms bound to cs@xmath148 ions next to charged interface , so the same technique could be applied to ba@xmath87 solutions in order to elucidate point 1 ) . regarding point 2 ) , if the amount of charge inversion is substantial , use of heavy ions such as i@xmath88 ( as opposed to cl@xmath88 ) , which have resonances in the x - ray region , could be detected by anomalous x - ray surface sensitive scattering @xcite combined with fluorescence methods .",
    "charge inversion always results from a favorable correlation free energy ( eq .",
    "[ eq : inv_general ] ) .",
    "we identified three different regimes leading to charge inversion , schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ eq : inv_general ] ) and provided specific criteria to theoretically identify each different regime ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ eq : inv_general ] ) , further illustrating it with a representative experimental example .",
    "we have provided a detailed discussion of the cc regime using recent md simulations of phosphatidic acid domains @xcite and showed how processes such as proton transfer and release are intimately related to correlations .",
    "furthermore , our results show the critical role played by strongly electronegative atoms ( the oxygens ) , which create binding sites , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bind ] , leading to the formation of highly cohesive complexes .",
    "this observation emphasizes the necessity of including atomic details in investigations of charged monolayers and membranes .",
    "future ab - initio calculations , with more rigorous inclusion of polarizability effects , may provide more precise insights into these issues .",
    "our results show possible pitfalls of excessive coarse - grained theories and simulations .",
    "considering a model where dmpa consists of single divalent point charge at the head group would be unable to generate the kind of complexes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bind ] . in this hypothetical coarse - grained model ,",
    "divalent counterions would most likely bind by tc in a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 and charge inversion could not follow .",
    "although our md simulations have only discussed the case of dmpa , our study can be used to predict ion distribution and charge inversion in many other systems .",
    "fatty acids , for example , with a surface charge very close to dmpa do not exhibit charge inversion @xcite .",
    "fatty acids only have two oxygens per molecule available for binding and binding constants become on the order @xmath173m@xmath42 @xcite .",
    "a similar situation is observed for dhdp ( dihexadecyl hydrogen - phosphate)@xcite , which does not exhibit charge inversion . on the other hand ,",
    "we predict that charge inversion should be a common effect in membranes of biologically relevant charged phospholipids such as phosphatidyl serine ( ps ) , phosphatidylinositol or glycolipids such as the gangliosides , which contain more than 10 oxygens per molecule and can become multiply charged . detailed quantitative predictions for these lipids will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the role of hydration sheaths on binding has not been discussed in this paper .",
    "although a detailed analysis is reported elsewhere @xcite , our simulation results show that ba@xmath87 ions lose roughly half of their hydration sheaths upon binding , so that the distance between bound ions and oxygens is given by the sum of their crystallographic radius .",
    "it is expected that this is a general result , as with very few exceptions , all negatively charged interfaces consist of oxygen atoms , and as exemplified from fig .",
    "[ fig : dmpa ] , oxygen charges are basically the same whether the oxygen is from water or within an interfacial group , and therefore trading a water for an interfacial oxygen is entropically favored , similarly as in mechanisms for ion selectivity in ion channels @xcite .",
    "our results also extend to other ions such as ca@xmath87 or sr@xmath87 , which share the same electronic structure with ba@xmath87 but with a considerably smaller crystallographic radius , which should enhance charge inversion by allowing the ions to get closer to the o atoms and increase their binding .",
    "other divalent ions like cd@xmath87 , which do not have the electronic structure of a noble gas , bind more strongly than ba@xmath87 or ca@xmath87 , but this binding is mainly covalent @xcite .",
    "this situation is usually referred as specific binding @xcite and can be described by a phenomenological binding constant encoding the free energy of the covalent bond . in this situation , @xmath174 can not be estimated theoretically ( with a formula such as eq .",
    "[ eq : bjerrum_constant ] ) and it is independent of environmental variables such as the dielectric constant of the solution , the charge surface density of the interface , etc ..    in conclusion , our results show that charge inversion is a common effect in charged interfaces in contact with a solution of multivalent ions , but it may have many different origins .",
    "how our results may extend to other charged systems such as proteins or biopolymers like dna or actin remains the subject for future work .",
