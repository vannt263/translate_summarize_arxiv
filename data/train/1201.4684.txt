    " both anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs )  are young , but rotate slowly because their strong dipole fields ( @xmath6 g ) have spun them down quickly . @xcite and @xcite suggested that such large fields can only be created through dynamo action in proto - neutron stars with @xmath7ms spin periods , which is shorter than the convective overturn time .",
    "searches for evidence of such fast initial rotation via its enhanced contribution , up to @xmath8 erg , to the explosion energy of the supernova remnants ( snrs ) hosting magnetars , have generally come up negative @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible that the diffusion of such rotational energy through the envelope of a supernova can explain some of the most luminous sne light curves that have been observed in recent years @xcite .",
    "the birth of a millisecond magnetar is also considered a possible channel for gamma - ray bursts .",
    "a possible consequence of the large internal magnetic fields ( @xmath9 g ) or fast initial rotation ( @xmath10ms ) of magnetars is a very high kick velocity .",
    "processes that are ineffective in ordinary neutron stars , but may produce @xmath11kms@xmath1 recoils in magnetars , include anisotropic mass loss in a wind or jet , the electromagnetic rocket effect , and anisotropic neutrino emission @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the central location of some magnetars within snrs has led to the inference that as a class their velocity is @xmath12kms@xmath1 @xcite , closer to that of the population of ordinary pulsars .",
    "the superposition of sgrs on massive star clusters or giant molecular clouds @xcite that are considered their likely birth places also offers circumstantial evidence that their velocities are unremarkable .",
    "attempts to actually measure velocities via x - ray or infrared imaging remain unfulfilled , and only the first radio - detected magnetar , xte  j1810197 , has a reported proper motion .",
    "using vlba observations , @xcite obtained a transverse velocity of @xmath5kms@xmath1 for xte  j1810197 , slightly below the average for young neutron stars .",
    "although the unknown radial component of velocity makes it impossible to draw firm conclusions , this result is not supportive of theories of magnetar formation mechanisms that require a high initial velocity .",
    "however , more measurements are required in order to actually measure the initial velocity distribution of this exotic class of neutron stars .",
    "the discovery of a second radio - emitting magnetar ,  @xcite , provided the opportunity for a second proper motion measurement . here",
    "we present long baseline array observations and the resulting proper motion for this 2s pulsar ( also known as 1e  1547.05408 ) .",
    "our vlbi observations and results are presented in sections  [ sec : vlbi ] and [ sec : results ] , and the implications for the birth velocity of and magnetars in general are discussed in section  [ sec : velocity ] .",

    "the lba consists of six antennas : the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , parkes , mopra and tidbinbilla antennas operated by csiro astronomy and space sciences , and the hobart and ceduna antennas operated by the university of tasmania .",
    "the first observation , obtained using a target of opportunity trigger in 2007 august , was made at 2.3ghz , and revealed that  suffers from severe scatter broadening due to the intervening ionized interstellar medium ( already measured in the time domain by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "was detected on the shortest baselines only , and the scatter broadening was estimated to be approximately 80 milliarcseconds ( mas ) at 2.3ghz .",
    "this scatter - broadening exceeds the prediction of the ne2001 model @xcite for the location of by a factor of 5 .",
    "accordingly , the remaining observations were made at 8.4ghz , where the effects of scatter - broadening are much less severe and the astrometric precision much higher .",

    "was identified as a probable calibrator based on lower - resolution data and confirmed as such in the first astrometric epoch .",
    "however , its relatively large angular separation from , @xmath15 , means that the quality of phase referencing is much poorer than with other equivalent lba observations at 8.4ghz ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a 5 minute target / calibrator cycle was employed , with 2 minute calibrator scans and 3 minute target scans .",
    "after the first epoch , scans to check phase referencing were included on other known calibrator sources within @xmath13 of , and the results used to refine its position . as the position for the calibrator source",
    "was refined in successive observations , different positions were used in correlation at each epoch , but in the final analysis all epochs were corrected to the more accurate position ultimately available in the rfc_2011d vlbi source catalog , ( j2000.0 ) r.a.=@xmath16 , decl.=@xmath17 , with errors of 5.4mas in r.a . and 2.0mas in decl .",

    "pulsar ephemerides were supplied at each epoch from accompanying timing observations done with the parkes telescope , and were used to set gates of widths that ranged between 7.5% and 20% of the pulse period .",
    "the applied gate width depended on the ( varying ) pulse profile at each epoch and the uncertainty in the pulse phase prediction caused by unstable rotation .",

    "the amplitudes were flattened ( and the data reweighted accordingly ) using a parseltongue script @xcite described in @xcite .",
    "correction of the amplitudes in this manner minimizes the flux scattered away from the true pulsar position and maximizes the significance of the final detection , at the expense of an elongated beam shape due to the time - variable weighting . after imaging using natural weighting ,",
    "the aips task jmfit was used to estimate positions and errors .",
    "the brightness of  varied considerably between epochs , but it was detected in all epochs with a significance ranging from 6@xmath18 to 20@xmath18 ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) , leading to positional fits with a nominal accuracy of @xmath19mas .    at 8.4ghz , the deconvolved , scatter - broadened angular diameter of was found to be @xmath20mas . in the four astrometric epochs , fits to the semi - major axis ranged between 5.5 and 8mas .",
    "this angular broadening leaves very little flux on baselines with length @xmath21 km , meaning these baselines contribute very little to the position fit .",
    "consequently , the longest lba baselines ( to hobart and ceduna ) contributed relatively little to the astrometric accuracy in this project .",
    "due to the large angular separation between the target and the calibrator , the astrometric errors are dominated not by the signal - to - noise ratio but by systematic contributions .",
    "the predominant systematic effects are introduced by the calibrator position uncertainty ( @xmath22mas ) , the station position uncertainties ( several centimeters ) and the unmodeled atmosphere ( delay equivalent to a path length of several centimeters ) .",
    "both simulations @xcite and extrapolation from past results with the lba @xcite suggest that under these conditions , the systematic contribution to astrometric error should be of order 1mas .    for the astrometric fit ,",
    "the magnetar parallax was fixed at 0.11mas , corresponding to a distance of 9kpc @xcite .",
    "varying the distance over a wide range of values , from 2kpc to infinity , made an insignificant ( @xmath23 ) change to the proper motion fit . without the addition of any systematic error estimate ,",
    "the reduced @xmath24 of the fit was 8.0 , indicating that as expected the formal errors in fitted position considerably overestimate the astrometric accuracy .",

    "the uncertainty on this estimate is unknown , but could approach 50% .",
    "an entirely different method relies on modeling three dust - scattered x - ray rings observed following a huge outburst of the magnetar that took place in 2009 january ( one month before the third lba epoch listed in table  [ tab : obs ] ) . using the scattered x - rays , @xcite",

    "correction for peculiar solar motion and galactic rotation using a flat rotation curve and the current iau recommended rotation constants ( r@xmath38 = 8.5 kpc , @xmath39 = 220kms@xmath1 ) adjusts this slightly to 280@xmath40kms@xmath1 , typical for the general population of ordinary pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "the small angular velocity of  also implies that an association between the pulsar and the possible snr shell g327.240.13 that apparently surrounds it @xcite remains plausible ( see * ? ? ?",
    "since the characteristic age of the pulsar is @xmath43  yr @xcite , the pulsar could have moved at most @xmath4413  since its birth .",
    "this is consistent with its location near the centre of the apparent snr , which has a diameter of @xmath45 .    with these two proper motions in hand , it is already very unlikely that magnetars as a class have exceptionally high space velocities .",
    "for example , if we assume that all magnetars have @xmath46  kms@xmath1 , then the probability that one will be observed with @xmath47  kms@xmath1 is 0.023 , while the probability that @xmath48  kms@xmath1 is 0.04 .",
    "jointly , the probability of both observations is @xmath49 under this assumption .",
    "if all magnetars have @xmath50  kms@xmath1 , then the corresponding individual probabilities become 0.094 and 0.171 , with 0.016 for the joint probability .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath51  kms@xmath1 as a reasonable ( @xmath52 ) upper limit on the typical magnetar velocity .",
    "additional measurements or constraints on magnetar proper motions would clearly be desirable to further constrain their distribution of space velocities .    unfortunately , x - ray observations with _",
    "chandra _ have yielded only upper limits that are not very restrictive .",

    ", @xcite find @xmath55kms@xmath1 assuming @xmath56kpc ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this result is not constraining if an association of sgr 1900 + 14 with a young star cluster at @xmath57kpc is accepted @xcite , since sgr 1900 + 14 remains within @xmath58 of the center of the cluster .",
    "similarly , the apparent association of sgr 180620 with a cluster of giant massive stars @xcite requires that magnetar to have a small velocity .    the only other known radio - emitting magnetar , psr  j16224950 @xcite , is an attractive target for the lba . but",
    "in the meantime , our lba measurement of the proper motion of  confirms that extremely high velocities need not result as a consequence of the formation of magnetars , and suggests that the velocity distribution of magnetars may not differ significantly from that of ordinary , rotation - powered neutron stars ."
