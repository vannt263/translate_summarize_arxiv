    "the study of integrable discrete systems has been pursued with particular intensity over the last decade .",
    "the results obtained surpassed expectations : not only does this reputably difficult domain yield a plethora of new and interesting results but it has also been possible to map in detail the parallels and divergences that exist between integrable discrete systems and their continuous counterparts . as paradigms of integrable discrete systems which were derived and exhaustibly studied we must mention here the discrete painlev equations , i.e. nonautonomous integrable mappings , the continuous limit of which are the well - known painlev equations .",
    "the progress in the domain of discrete integrability was made possible by the development of adequate integrability detectors .",
    "the first such detector that has been proposed was singularity confinement .",
    "it was based on the observation that for integrable mappings any spontaneously appearing singularity disappears after a few iteration steps .",
    "although singularity confinement was instrumental in the derivation of several new integrable discrete systems , as for example the discrete painlev equations@xcite , it became clear that this property in fact characterises only a restricted class of mappings .",
    "the conjecture which we have proposed in @xcite can be formulated as follows : mappings integrable through spectral methods have the singularity confinement property .",
    "singularity confinement in itself is not sufficient in order to control the complexity of the iterates of a given mapping .",
    "this latter property turned out to be crucial for integrability and thus new integrability detectors were proposed based on this feature .",
    "viallet and collaborators @xcite have introduced the notion of algebraic entropy , which is linked to arnord s complexity @xcite .",
    "it is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the degree of the numerator ( or denominator ) of the @xmath3-th iterate of rational mapping .",
    "while nonintegrable mappings exhibit exponential growth and thus nonzero algebraic entropy , integrable ones have zero algebraic entropy , their degree growth being polynomial .    while the detection of integrability is essential , it is by far not sufficient .",
    "as kruskal has always kept pointing out , once an integrable mapping is obtained , one must still perform the complete study of its dynamics .",
    "the difficulty lies in the existence of singularities which lead to indeterminate points , i.e. points where the iterates of the mapping is not well defined .",
    "fortunately , for mappings which have the singularity confinement property , only a finite number of such points do exist . in order to deal with these indeterminacies , one must introduce the adequate ( local ) description of the singularities .",
    "a first step towards this description of integrable discrete systems was undertaken by sakai @xcite who presented a geometric approach to the theory of painlev equations based on rational surfaces , which are called spaces of initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the result was a classification of discrete painlev equations in terms of type of rational surfaces and affine weyl groups .",
    "further developments in this direction were those introduced by one of the authors ( tt ) , based on the characterisation of mappings from the theory of rational surfaces . in a series of previous works @xcite",
    "this approach was used for :    \\a ) mappings which are nonintegrable while having the singularity confinement property .",
    "it was possible in that case to obtain rigorously the value of their algebraic entropy .",
    "\\b ) the mappings of the sakai classification , for which it was shown that the degree growth is up to quadratic .    here",
    "the same approach will be applied to a different class of integrable mappings : linearisable ones @xcite . by linearisable we mean mappings which can be reduced to a local linear difference system .",
    "the difficulty in the present case lies in the fact that , generically , linearisable mappings have _ unconfined _ singularities .",
    "thus one must perform the local study around an infinite number of singularities .",
    "still , due to the particular structure of these systems , this turns out to be possible and allows us to compute precisely their degree growth ( which coincides with the one previously obtained empirically ) .",
    "moreover , the corresponding surfaces provide a straight - forward way to construct transformations of these mappings to linear mappings in cascade .",
    "this section is devoted to a review of some basic notions , which we will use later , and the arrangement of notations . in this paper",
    "we consider mainly birational mappings , but in order to compare the notions of space of initial conditions and analytical stability @xcite we consider dominant rational mappings ( i.e. meromorphic mappings such that the closure of each image in the target manifold is the manifold itself ) instead of birational mappings in this section .",
