    "creation of new forms of strongly interacting matter , in particular , the observation of a deconfined and chirally restored state , is the main goal of present and future experiments with relativistic heavy - ion beams @xcite .",
    "significant progress in understanding the dynamics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions and the properties of dense matter produced in such collisions has been achieved in experiments at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite .",
    "recently the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has started a new era in high - energy nuclear physics by colliding p+p and au+au beams at much higher energies than in previous experiments , and new interesting results have been obtained already , see , e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the investigations of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter in the temperature - chemical potential plane and , in particular , searching for manifestations of the qcd - based phase transitions remains in the focus of theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "the signatures of such phase transitions have been studied mostly based on equilibrium concepts . however , the process of a relativistic heavy - ion collision at rhic and lhc energies is very fast and one should expect that the phase transition may be strongly affected by the dynamics .",
    "thus , it is important to study the phase transition dynamics in a time - dependent background .",
    "previously non - equilibrium effects associated with the chiral / deconfinement phase transition have been studied within several macroscopic approaches @xcite .",
    "generally , in order to investigate non - equilibrium effects , one should solve a quantum many - body problem by using , e.g. kadanoff - baym equation .",
    "but applying such formalism to relativistic heavy - ion collisions is very complicated , see , e.g. ref .",
    "fortunately , there is still hope that the collective behavior of the hot matter created in heavy - ion collisions can be described by a coarse - grained macroscopic theory , such as hydrodynamics .",
    "indeed , some aspects of relativistic heavy - ion collisions , such as the collective flow of the produced matter , are well described in the framework of hydrodynamic models @xcite . however , in order to describe a phase transition in a time - dependent background , the usual hydrodynamic model should be modified by explicitly considering the dynamics of the order parameter .",
    "this becomes necessary when the time scale associated with the order parameter relaxation becomes of the same order or longer than the characteristic time associated with the hydrodynamic variables . in the opposite limit",
    ", the effect of a phase transition can be taken into account through the eos , as is usually done in macrophysics(see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we use a modified hydrodynamic theory , namely the chiral fluid dynamics ( cdf ) , in which the fluid evolution is coupled to the dynamics of the chiral order parameter .",
    "this model was firstly proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and further developed in several works @xcite .",
    "recently it was generalized by including fluctuations of the order parameter and dissipative terms @xcite .",
    "it can be derived from the linear sigma model by assuming that microscopic and macroscopic degrees of freedom are clearly separated .",
    "then the coarse - grained macroscopic dynamics is described only by a reduced number of variables , which are called the gross variables @xcite .    as was first pointed out by van hove @xcite , the relaxation time of the order parameter increases near the second order phase transition and",
    "it diverges at the critical point .",
    "this phenomenon is known as `` critical slowing down '' .",
    "its importance for modeling phase transitions in dynamical environments was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this situation",
    "non - equilibrium effects need to be considered explicitly even in an ideal fluid .",
    "this can be done by choosing the order parameter as another gross variable .    in the region of the phase diagram where the deconfinement / chiral phase transition is of first order , an extra time - scale appears , which is associated with the nucleation process @xcite .",
    "only when this time scale is short with respect to the hydrodynamic time scale , we can assume a two - phase equilibrium and the equation of state given by the maxwell construction .",
    "however , if it is not the case , the system will pass through a metastable region of the equation of state and can even reach the point of spinodal instability @xcite .",
    "in order to investigate this possibility , we study the stability of fluctuations around a hydrostatic state and a bjorken - type expanding state . by comparing the results , we will be able to identify those features of the phase transition which are affected by the fast dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive basic equations of cfd from the linear @xmath3-model with constituent quarks . in section iii",
    "we discuss the predictions of this model for the equilibrated system undergoing a chiral phase transition .",
    "then in section iv we calculate the excitation spectrum of the system by introducing fluctuations around the static background solution . in section",
    "v we study the time evolution of fluctuations in the bjorken - like expanding background . our concluding remarks are presented in section vi .",
    "as the low - energy effective theory of qcd , we adopt the linear sigma model with constituent quarks @xcite whose qualitative features ( chiral symmetry , universality class , phase transition structure ) are thought to coincide with qcd @xcite .",
    "more recently the thermodynamics of this model was studied on the mean - field level @xcite , as well as including the field fluctuations @xcite . following the previous works @xcite",

    "@xcite , the model assuming continuous generation and damping of fluctuations gives a more realistic description of the order - parameter dynamics in the course of a first order phase transition .",

    "@xcite , boost - invariant solutions of the navier - stokes equation becomes unstable when bulk viscosity is large .",
    "this instability may play a significant role in the hadronization of the hot matter produced in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "therefore , it is worth comparing the instability - generating mechanism investigated in this work with that of refs .",
