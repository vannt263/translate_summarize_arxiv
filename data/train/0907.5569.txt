    "the study of adsorption of molecules on the surface of different bodies covers an extremely wide class of problems of physics and chemistry and is one of the most important problems both from the theoretical point of view and for practical applications .",
    "the results of numerous investigations show that adsorption of molecules on surfaces of bodies leads to changes in various physical and chemical characteristics of these bodies .",
    "the detailed analysis of changes in the properties of the surface due to adsorption is given in @xcite .",
    "the results of investigation of changes in properties of the surface due to adsorption ",
    "desorption processes are also widely used in the design of various sensors ( physical , chemical , and biological ) @xcite whose action is based on the use of the change in a certain characteristic of a sensitive element of the sensor due to adsorption of molecules on its surface .",
    "the results of the theory of adsorption are extremely important for investigation of heterogenous - catalytic reactions because processes of adsorption and desorption are integral stages of these reactions .",
    "the classical langmuir theory that describes adsorption of a gas on solid surfaces is based on several assumptions .",
    "numerous theoretical investigations , which , to a large extent , were stimulated by many experimental data that did not agree with conclusions of the langmuir theory , were aimed at the construction of more general models free of one or several restrictions of the langmuir theory . an extensive material obtained on the basis of these models and applications to various problems of adsorption and catalysis",
    "are widely presented in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it is established that taking account of lateral interactions between adsorbed molecules can lead to a qualitative change in adsorption isotherms , namely , to a hysteresis of isotherms and to structural changes in the surface of bodies ( surveys of theoretical and experimental results are given , e.g. , in @xcite ) .    at the same time , as early as in 1938 , in @xcite , zeldovich has suggested an idea on a change in the surface in the course of adsorption and desorption due to the presence of adsorbed molecules on it .",
    "using this idea , he has predicted a hysteresis of adsorption isotherms if the typical time of adsorption and desorption is much less than the relaxation time of the surface .",
    "note that a change in adsorption isotherms due to lateral interactions between adsorbed molecules can also be interpreted as a consequence of a certain change in adsorption properties of the surface caused by adsorption .",
    "however , as far as we know , the problem of variation in adsorption properties of the surface itself in the course of adsorption and desorption of molecules of gas on it in the absence of interactions between adsorbed molecules and the possibility of hysteresis of adsorption isotherms in the this case remains open .",
    "the present paper is devoted to investigation of specific features of the behavior of adsorption isotherms and the kinetics of the surface coverage by adsorbate molecules with regard for variations in adsorption properties of the surface in the course of adsorption  desorption .    in sec .  2",
    ", we propose a self - consistent model taking into account variations in adsorption properties of the surface in the process of adsorption  desorption of molecules of gas on it .",
    "we introduce a dimensionless coupling parameter that characterizes the interaction of an adsorbed molecule with polarized medium .",
    "we obtain adsorption isotherms and establish that their behavior essentially depends on the value of this parameter ( sec .  3 ) .",
    "it is shown that , within the framework of the proposed model , the zeldovich hysteresis is possible . in sec .  4",
    ", we investigate specific features of the kinetics of the surface coverage .",
    "it is established that variations in adsorption properties of the surface in the course of adsorption  desorption cardinally change the langmuir kinetics .",
    "we consider a problem of adsorption of molecules of a one - component gas on the surface of a solid adsorbent . according to the classical langmuir theory ,",
    "molecules of gas are adsorbed on adsorption centers located on the adsorbent surface and the number of centers does not change with time .",
    "furthermore , all centers have equal adsorption activity ( energy - uniform surface ) , do not interact with each other , and each adsorption center can be bound only with one adsorbate molecule .",
    "the langmuir kinetics of the quantity of adsorbed substance is described by the differential equation @xcite    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the surface coverage by adsorbate , @xmath2 is the total number of adsorption centers , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are , respectively , the numbers of occupied and free ( @xmath5 ) adsorption centers at the time @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the adsorption and desorption rate constants , respectively , and @xmath9 is the concentration of molecules in the gas phase that is kept constant .    the solution of this equation with zero initial condition @xmath10 has the form @xcite    @xmath11,\\ ] ]    where    @xmath12    is the stationary surface coverage ( langmuir isotherm ) , which is defined by the single dimensionless quantity ( dimensionless concentration ) @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the adsorption ",
    "desorption equilibrium constant for the given concentration of gas ,    @xmath15    is the time taken for the surface coverage to reach the stationary value @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the typical lifetime of a complex ( adsorption center + adsorbed molecule ) .",
    "according to ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , there is a single - valued correspondence between the gas concentration and the surface coverage . at the same time , in @xcite , zeldovich has suggested an idea on a change in adsorption properties of the surface in the process of adsorption and desorption and , using this idea , predicted a hysteresis of adsorption isotherms if the typical time of adsorption and desorption is much less than the relaxation time of the surface .    in the present paper , within the framework of the langmuir model ,",
    "we take into account variations in properties of the surface of a homogenous adsorbent with plane boundary in the process of adsorption and desorption of molecules of a one - component gas on it .",
    "we introduce the cartesian coordinate system centered at the surface of the adsorbent with @xmath18-axis directed into the adsorbent perpendicularly to its surface so that the adsorbent and the gas occupy the regions @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "each adsorption center is simulated by a one - dimensional linear oscillator of mass @xmath21 that oscillates perpendicularly to the surface about its equilibrium position @xmath22 . in the absence of adsorbate",
    ", the motion of an absorption center is described by the well - known equation of motion of a free linear oscillator    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the restoring force constant , @xmath25 is the friction coefficient , and @xmath26 is the coordinate of the oscillator .    in the general case , due to occupation of the adsorption center with a molecule of adsorbate , the electron structure of the center changes , which results in a change in the interaction of the center with neighboring atoms of the adsorbent , i.e. , to a local polarization of the adsorbent . as a result , the medium acts on the complex with a certain force @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the running coordinate of the complex , which is the reaction of the medium on the electron reconstruction of the adsorption center . under the action of this force",
    ", the complex tends to a new equilibrium position different from the equilibrium position @xmath22 of the free center .",
    "if the polarization of adsorbent caused by the formation of the complex is axially symmetric about the axis passing through the complex and parallel to the @xmath18-axis , then this force has only the component normal to the boundary , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the unit vector along the @xmath18-axis ; for convenience , the center has the coordinate @xmath31 .",
    "the force @xmath27 either acts on each oscillator of the system if the oscillator is occupied with a molecule of gas or does not act if it is free , i.e. , the oscillator interacts with the polarized medium only for discrete time intervals .",
    "instead , we consider an approximation where the oscillator ",
    "medium interaction is continuous in time and the oscillator is permanently bound with molecule with the time - dependent probability equal to the surface coverage @xmath32 . in this case , @xmath33 .",
    "this approximation is analogous to the mean - field approximation used in problems of adsorption with regard for lateral interactions between adsorbed particles @xcite .",
    "we represent the force @xmath34 in the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the potential energy of interaction of the polarized medium with the complex . expanding the quantity @xmath36 in the taylor series and keeping only the linear term",
    ", we obtain    @xmath37    where the parameter of complex  polarized medium interaction @xmath38 is the force acting on the complex by the medium polarized by this complex .",
    "ignoring the internal motion in the bound molecule  center system , i.e. , considering the motion of the complex as a whole , and taking into account a change in the mass of the oscillator in the process of adsorption  desorption within the framework of this approximation , we obtain the following equation of motion for the oscillator :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the effective mass of the complex that varies in the process of adsorption  desorption and @xmath41 is the mass of an adsorbate molecule . since @xmath42 , the effective mass of the complex does not exceed its total mass @xmath43 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( 7 ) that bonding of an adsorbate molecule with center leads to a shift of the equilibrium position of the oscillator by @xmath44 and to a change in the potential energy of the free oscillator equal to @xmath45 by @xmath46 . in the limiting case where all centers are bound ,",
    "i.e , @xmath47 , the equilibrium position @xmath48 of the bound oscillator is maximally distant from the surface and the potential energy of the oscillator @xmath49 at this equilibrium position is minimal and equal to a half of the energy of interaction of the bound oscillator with the polarized medium , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .    thus , due to the interaction of adsorbate molecules with adsorption centers",
    ", centers shift relative to the nonperturbed surface of the adsorbent , i.e. , this interaction leads to the formation ( for adsorption ) and healing ( for desorption ) of local defects of the surface . for @xmath52 ,",
    "these defects are `` pits '' ( for @xmath53 ) or `` hills '' ( for @xmath54 ) whose depth and height depend on the properties of both the adsorbate and the adsorbent . in the special case where all atoms of the surface are adsorption centers",
    ", this interaction leads to a shift of the surface of the adsorbent either inwards ( for @xmath53 ) or outwards ( for @xmath54 ) , i.e. , to the relaxation of the surface @xcite .",
    "in other words , the processes of adsorption and desorption result in a deformation of the surface of the adsorbent , which leads , in the general case , to changes in the adsorption and desorption rates and , as a consequence , the surface coverage . within the framework of the langmuir theory of kinetics on the nondeformable surface ( @xmath55 ) ,",
    "the adsorption and desorption rate constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 do not depend on the concentration of gas and are defined by the arrhenius relations    @xmath56    where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the activation energies for adsorption and desorption , respectively , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the preexponential factors , @xmath61 is the absolute temperature , and @xmath62 is the boltzmann constant .    a molecule bound with center , due to its interaction with polarized medium , is in a deeper potential well than in the case of the nondeformable surface .",
    "therefore , for its desorption , the molecule requires an energy greater than @xmath58 by the value @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is an additional energy that the bound molecule must acquire to break the bond with polarized medium .    generally speaking , the polarization of the medium can also affect the number of free molecules of gas that can overcome the adsorption barrier @xmath57 , i.e. , a peculiar activation of free molecules of gas occurs and varies in the process of adsorption  desorption . here , we do not take into account a change in the activation energy for adsorption ( some results obtained with regard for a decrease in the activation energy for adsorption in the process of adsorption  desorption are presented in appendix a ) .",
    "supposing that the preexponential factor @xmath60 is not changed , we obtain the following expression for @xmath8 :    @xmath65    it is worth noting that this quantity already depends on the concentration of gas because it is defined by the current state of the surface ( the quantity @xmath26 ) that depends on the concentration of gas .",
    "therefore , adsorption and desorption of molecules proceed on the surface whose adsorption characteristics vary with time .    introducing the dimensionless coordinate of oscillator @xmath66",
    ", we obtain the following autonomous system of nonlinear differential equations , which describes the kinetics of the quantity of adsorbed substance with regard for variations in adsorption properties of the surface in the process of adsorption  desorption :    @xmath67    where the dimensionless parameter @xmath68 , which characterizes the interaction of an adsorbed molecule with polarized medium , can be called a coupling parameter . in the absence of interaction ( the linear case ) where @xmath55 ( @xmath69 ) , the parameter @xmath70 .",
    "note that system ( 10)(11 ) , in many respects , is analogous to the system of equations given in @xcite , which describes a transport of electrons in a system of molecules of biological nature with regard for electron - conformation interaction .",
    "in the stationary case , it follows from eq .  ( 11 ) that @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , the equilibrium state of system ( 10)(11 ) is defined not by the pair of quantities ( @xmath72 ) , as is typical of dynamical systems of two equations @xcite , but only by one quantity @xmath73 , which is a solution of the equation    @xmath74    in the general case , it is hardly possible to solve the transcendental equation ( 12 ) in the explicit form .",
    "nevertheless , based on this equation , we can make a qualitative conclusion on the influence of a change in adsorption properties of the surface on the surface coverage . to this end , note that the ratio @xmath75 is equal to @xmath76 and the quantity @xmath77 is also the ratio @xmath76 but in the linear case . rewriting relation ( 12 ) in the form    @xmath78",
    "we see that a change in properties of the surface caused by adsorption and desorption leads to an increase in the surface coverage for any concentration of gas .",
    "the difference between the numbers of bound centers in the nonlinear ( @xmath79 ) and linear cases increases with the coupling parameter @xmath80 .",
    "this conclusion can also be made by taking into account that , in the stationary case , the desorption rate characteristic ( 9 ) has the form    @xmath81    where the surface coverage @xmath32 is a solution of eq .",
    "( 12 ) . for a system",
    "whose adsorption properties vary in the process of adsorption  desorption , the adsorption ",
    "desorption equilibrium constant    @xmath82    is greater than the classical adsorption  desorption equilibrium constant @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , the equilibrium of the system shifts towards an increase in the number of adsorbed molecules .",
    "it follows from ( 14 ) that the interaction of adsorbed molecules with polarized medium results in an increase in the typical lifetime of complex    @xmath84    and , hence , an increase in the surface coverage .    to analyze solutions of eq .",

    "( 12 ) are the abscissas of the points of intersection of a horizontal line corresponding to the given concentration @xmath77 ( the left - hand side of eq .",

    "( 12 ) ) , which is shown in the figure for different values of the parameter @xmath80 .",
