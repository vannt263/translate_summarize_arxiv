    "ever since its discovery more than seventy years ago , quantum entanglement has been considered as the central essence of quantum theory , forcing us to rethink our view of reality , locality and causality .",
    "it impressively highlights the non - local - realistic and contextual character of nature and thereby provides insights into the very foundations of physics .",
    "moreover , during the last two decades , it has become more and more clear that entanglement can serve as a resource for future information processing technologies , such as quantum cryptography , dense coding , quantum teleportation and quantum computing .",
    "it is even argued that entanglement plays a role in quantum phase transitions @xcite , ionization processes @xcite , high energy physics @xcite and light - harvesting complexes @xcite .",
    "when it comes to studying quantum phenomena in diverse systems one is regularly confronted with the problems of how to detect , characterize and quantify entanglement . with the exception of bipartite qubit systems ,",
    "these problems are in general extremely hard to solve for systems of arbitrary number of parties and dimensions , i.e. multipartite qudits .    in the present paper",
    "we focus on a finer characterization of _ genuine multipartite entanglement _",
    "@xcite in multilevel systems .",
    "genuine multipartite entangled states have been shown to be vital for fundamental tests of quantum physics @xcite and find application in measurement - based quantum computing @xcite and quantum secret sharing @xcite .",
    "although , this type of entanglement is not bounded on the dimensionality of the local systems , the use of systems with more than two levels , i.e. qudits , brings with it several advantages and deeper insights .",
    "for instance , it was found that quantum correlations are more robust against decoherence the more degrees of freedom are entangled @xcite .",
    "qudit entanglement also improves the security of quantum key distribution @xcite , and allows quantum secret sharing schemes @xcite , distributed protocols @xcite and error - correcting codes @xcite which can not be realized with qubits .",
    "it is also to be expected that quantum computers that encode more than one qubit of information in each particle will require less resources and will thus be more efficient @xcite .",
    "furthermore , high - dimensional multipartite entanglement is essential for a complete understanding of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide practical and experimentally feasible criteria that allow to examine the dimensionality of genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "the central problem is the following : suppose we have realized a multipartite qudit scenario in the laboratory .",
    "how can we verify if a state is genuine multipartite entangled ( gme ) and how many degrees of freedom are involved in the entanglement ?",
    "for pure states this question is easily answered via the ranks of the reduced density matrices . however , for mixed states , as they appear in any real experiment , this is a nontrivial problem .",
    "consider e.g. the mixed state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a tripartite greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( _ ghz _ ) state entangled in three degrees of freedom .",
    "this state @xmath2 is not truly three - dimensionally entangled since it can be decomposed into @xmath3 with @xmath4 , which are each entangled in only two local degrees of freedom .",
    "let us first give a precise definition of the dimensionality of multipartite entanglement  a multipartite generalization of the schmidt rank @xcite complementary to the tensor rank @xcite that allows to characterize multipartite qudit states .",
    "this generalization is important as the tensor rank is _ not _ the crucial characteristic that the many - body entangled qudit states in @xcite have in common .",
    "this is mainly because in the multipartite case there is no simple connection between the tensor rank , @xmath5-separability and multilevel entanglement .",
    "for example ,",
    "the states @xmath6 , @xmath1 and @xmath7 all have tensor rank  @xmath8 .",
    "however , only @xmath9 is commonly regarded as multilevel - multipartite entangled .",
    "hence , for a finer categorization of multipartite entanglement it is needed to specify novel characteristic quantities .    for a pure @xmath10-partite state @xmath11 consider the set of all reduced density matrices @xmath12 regarding all bipartitions @xmath13 .",
    "evidently , iff the state @xmath14 is fully separable then the rank of all reduced density matrices @xmath15 is @xmath16 . on the other hand",
    ", the state @xmath14 contains entanglement iff there exists a @xmath15 with @xmath17 . for a fixed bipartition @xmath18 , the dimensionality of entanglement is determined by the schmidt rank @xcite which equals @xmath19 .",
    "hence , iff @xmath20 with @xmath21 then the state @xmath14 contains @xmath22-dimensional entanglement .",
    "we define a state to be @xmath22-dimensionally _ genuine multipartite entangled _ ( gme )",
    "iff it is at least @xmath22-dimensionally entangled with respect to _ all _ bipartitions , that is @xmath23 .",
    "this can be extended to mixed states in a natural way : a mixed state @xmath24 is @xmath22-dimensionally entangled iff there exists no decomposition @xmath25 into pure states @xmath26 of dimensionality @xmath27 all obeying @xmath28 , but a decomposition into pure states satisfying @xmath29 for all @xmath30 . a mixed state @xmath24 is @xmath22-dimensionally gme iff any decomposition @xmath25 of @xmath31 contains at least one gme state @xmath32 of dimensionality @xmath22 or higher .",
    "the problem of determining the dimensionality of multipartite entanglement for a given mixed state @xmath31 is as complex as the separability problem , since it is practically impossible to vary over all pure state decompositions of @xmath31 .",
    "for this reason it is imperative to find computable criteria for the detection of high - dimensional genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "first steps in this direction have recently been made by lim _",
    "_ @xcite and li _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . however , the criterion by lim _",
    "_ is only able to discriminate @xmath33-dimensional from @xmath8-dimensional genuine multipartite entanglement in tripartite three - level systems .",
    "the criterion by li _",
    "_ applies to arbitrary dimensionality and system size , but its noise resistance is rather unsatisfactory .",
    "hence , further progress is needed here .",
    "recently , a framework of criteria detecting genuine multipartite entanglement was introduced in @xcite .",
    "although it belongs to the strongest criteria for the detection of gme states without requiring semidefinite programming @xcite , it does not discriminate states of different dimensionality . in the present paper",
    ", we show how this powerful framework can be extended for verifying the presence of high - dimensional genuine multipartite entanglement in arbitrary mixed states .",
    "consider a density matrix @xmath31 of an @xmath10-partite @xmath34-level system , i.e. a hilbert space @xmath35 .",
    "for a twofold copy @xmath36 on @xmath37 we define for each bipartition @xmath18 of @xmath38 a permutation operator @xmath39 which permutes the subsystem @xmath40 with its copy @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 for instance , for the bipartition @xmath43 and the vector @xmath44 the corresponding operator @xmath45 acts like @xmath46 using this abbreviation we introduce the quantity @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where the @xmath50 are vectors of an orthonormal basis @xmath51 of @xmath52 and the sum runs over all bipartitions @xmath53 . furthermore , we introduce the quantities @xmath54 @xmath55\\ ] ] wherein @xmath56 are product vectors , where @xmath57 of the @xmath10 local systems contained in the set @xmath58 are in the state @xmath59 and remaining ones in @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we have @xmath63 the innermost sum depends on @xmath64 and runs over is always neglected . ]",
    "@xmath65 where the complement ( overline ) is taken with respect to the set @xmath66 .",
    "now , the main result of this paper is that if any of these functions @xmath67 fulfills @xmath68 for a given density matrix @xmath31 , then this state is at least @xmath22-dimensionally genuine multipartite entangled .",
    "one standard strategy for detecting entanglement or distinguishing different types of entanglement is to introduce a quantity @xmath69 and to maximize it over all states of a specific type ( e.g. @xmath5-separable states , states with particular schmidt - rank , states of an entanglement class , etc . ) .",
    "consequently , if for a particular state @xmath31 this maximum is exceeded , it necessarily must be of a different kind . the main problem in deriving entanglement criteria in this way",
    "is the involved maximization .",
    "the complexity of this problem can be reduced by using quantities @xmath69 which are convex in @xmath31 , because in this case the optimization has to be performed over all pure states only .",
    "nevertheless , the difficulty of finding the global maximum remains .    in the present paper ,",
    "a completely new approach is used .",
    "namely , the convex quantities @xmath67 are constructed by incorporating the matrix elements of specific @xmath22-dimensionally gme states .",
    "this is done in a way such that by construction any other state of same or lower dimensionality can not reach a certain bound .",
    "thus , to prove that @xmath70 holds for all states which are entangled in equal or less than @xmath22 degrees , no maximization has to be carried out .",
    "first , consider the @xmath22-dimensionally genuine @xmath10-partite entangled _ ghz _ state @xmath71 in density matrix form @xmath72 , the only nonzero elements are @xmath73 .",
    "each term @xmath74 in ( [ q0 ] ) singles out the absolute value of an off - diagonal element of @xmath75 , such that @xmath76 as can easily be confirmed , all terms @xmath77 vanish for any choice of @xmath78 and any bipartition @xmath18 as the corresponding matrix elements are all zero .",
    "thus , we have shown that @xmath79 for @xmath75 .",
    "in addition , it was proven in @xcite that @xmath80 ) can only be larger than zero if the state @xmath31 is genuine multipartite entangled in @xmath81 and @xmath60 . now , since in ( [ q0 ] ) the absolute values of all off - diagonal elements of @xmath75 are added up , and since all terms which are subtracted from this sum are zero for @xmath75 , it follows that @xmath82 is the only @xmath22-dimensionally gme pure state that reaches @xmath79 .",
    "thus , any state that exceeds @xmath83 must at least be @xmath84-dimensionally gme , which proves ( [ criterion ] ) for @xmath85 .",
    "[ temperature ]   and @xmath86 .",
    "the scale indicates up to which value of white noise a state is detected to be @xmath22-dimensionally genuine multipartite entangled ( gme ) .",
    "a ) up to the illustrated thresholds for @xmath87 , the state @xmath88 is detected to be gme , i.e. @xmath89 .",

    ", we introduce the @xmath22-dimensionally genuine multipartite entangled @xmath57-_dicke state _",
    "@xmath95 @xmath96 with @xmath61 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "note that this includes a generalization @xmath97 of the prominent @xmath98 state for qudits state was introduced in @xcite .",
    "however , the state introduced therein is local - unitarily equivalent to the original @xmath98 state , and therefore does not contain higher - dimensional entanglement . ] .",
    "first , observe that for any fixed choice of @xmath99 in @xmath67 , ( [ qm ] ) reduces to the inequalities from refs .",
    "@xcite , i.e. in this case it is proven that @xmath100 holds for all biseparable states . on the other hand , by summing over all @xmath5 and @xmath101 in @xmath67 we add up the absolute value of specific off - diagonal elements @xmath102 of the @xmath57-_dicke state _ @xmath103 . from these off - diagonal elements",
    "( determined by the proper set @xmath104 ) there are corresponding diagonal elements ( labeled @xmath105 ) subtracted , which correspond to biseparable states having the same off - diagonal elements . for a subset of all those off - diagonal elements",
    "this suffices ( as with the inequality based on @xmath106 ) , however , for some there are no corresponding diagonal elements belonging to a biseparable state .",
    "in order to guarantee that @xmath107 for all biseparable states one also needs to subtract the corresponding diagonal elements of the _ dicke state _",
    "( labeled @xmath108 ) .",
    "counting the cardinality of this subset is a purely combinatorial problem ( similar to @xcite ) resulting in the factor @xmath109 . by construction , this guarantees for fixed dimensionality , the maximal value of @xmath67 for the corresponding _ dicke state _ , as in this case the sum of the off - diagonal elements is maximal , whereas all @xmath105 are zero . by scaling this maximum with the constant @xmath110 we can unify all quantities",
    "@xmath67 in one consistent framework , i.e. the only @xmath22-dimensionally gme pure state that can attain @xmath111 is @xmath112 .     for the tripartite four - level state @xmath113 .",
    "the dark gray region is detected to be @xmath114-dimensionally gme ( in comparison , fidelity - based criteria merely detect the white meshed part of this region to be @xmath114-dimensionally gme ) .",
    "the middle gray region is detected to be at least @xmath8-dimensionally gme , and the light gray region is detected to be at least @xmath33-dimensionally gme.,width=453 ]",
    "the introduced criteria allow to examine the dimensionality of multipartite entanglement in a noisy environment . fig .",
    "[ temperature ] shows the robustness for the states @xmath115 and @xmath86 in the presence of white noise .",
    "we compared the illustrated thresholds with the thresholds of entanglement witnesses that follow from the fidelity of a state ( see @xcite ) , i.e. a state is @xmath34-dimensionally gme if @xmath116 or @xmath117 , respectively . here",
    ", we found that our criteria are strictly stronger for all @xmath118 and @xmath119  specifically , they outperform the noise robustness of previously known criteria @xcite for _ ghz_-like states .",
    "e.g. , the tripartite state @xmath120 is detected to be @xmath8-dimensionally gme by @xmath121 for @xmath122 , whereas @xmath123 merely detects the range @xmath124 . for @xmath125",
    "the difference is even more significant : using @xmath126 , we detect the range @xmath127 in comparison to @xmath128 following from @xmath129 .",
    "a further example of the detection strength is given in fig .",
    "as can be seen therein , the region of states detected by our criteria is considerably larger than the region revealed by fidelity - based witnesses .",
    "finally , let us stress that the quantities @xmath67 are by construction optimally suited to detect @xmath22-dimensional gme states which are close to _ ghz _ , _ w _ and _ dicke states_. if instead an unclassified input state is given one can improve the detection by maximizing the outcome of @xmath67 over local - unitary transformations .",
    "an appropriate optimization scheme can be found in @xcite .",
    "creating high - dimensional multipartite entangled states is one of the current challenges in experiments on quantum physics . in the present paper",
    ", we gave a precise mathematical characterization of such states and provided criteria for the dimensionality of genuine multipartite entanglement applicable to arbitrary multi - qudit systems .",
    "these criteria are easily computable since they do not rely on semidefinite programming or eigenvalue computations , but only on functions of density matrix elements .",
    "they are also advantageous in experiments , as they are rather robust against noise and to apply them it is not necessary to determine the entire density matrix of the system under consideration . in detail , due to the fact that the quantities @xmath67 only involve the matrix elements of _ ghz _ , _ w _ and _ dicke states _ , it is merely needed to determine these few entries of the density matrix , which can always be achieved via local measurements and corresponding correlations ( see also the discussion in e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , they can be experimentally implemented with a reduced number of local observables , since the number of measurements for a full quantum state tomography scales exponentially in the number of parties @xmath10 , i.e. is of the order @xmath130 @xcite , whereas the number of density matrix elements that occur in @xmath67 is only of the order @xmath131 , that is polynomial in @xmath10 ( note that the notation in terms of two - fold copies of a state is only a matter of compactness , i.e. in experiments it is not necessarily needed to have two copies at a time ) .",
    "finally , it is noteworthy that our results are even promising to be closely related to measures of genuine multipartite entanglement , as e.g. for multipartite qubits the quantity @xmath106 yields a strong lower bound on the _ gme - concurrence _ @xcite ."
