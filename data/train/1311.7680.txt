    "in the context of cosmology , it has become an inevitable fact through the combined efforts of type ia supernova , the large scale structure ( lss ) , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and wmap that universe is undergoing a stage of accelerating expansion @xcite . this cosmic behavior might be due to the repulsive nature of missing energy ( due to the large negative pressure ) called dark energy ( de ) which occupies 70 percent of the universe .",
    "it is described by a tiny time - independent cosmological constant @xmath0 obeying @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the equation of state ( eos ) parameter ) . due to the fine - tuning and cosmic coincidence issues",
    "@xcite of this constant , the search for variety of de models is ongoing .",
    "the dynamical nature of de is divided into two categories : scalar field models ( quintessence , phantom with negative kinetic term , k - essence , quintom ( unification of quintessence and phantom ) etc . ) @xcite and interacting de models ( chaplygin gas having novel eos , holographic de , ricci de etc . ) @xcite .",
    "the standard cosmology ( big - bang model ) successfully explains the observations of cmb radiations but still there are some unresolved issues .",
    "the early universe is facing some long standing problems including horizon problem ( why is the universe isotropic and homogeneous on large scale structure ? ) , flatness ( why is @xmath3 today ? ) , monopole issue ( why do not they exist ? ) and finally what is the origin of the fluctuations ?",
    "the inflationary scenario @xmath4 proved to be a cornerstone to explain the mechanism of the early universe and provides the most compelling solution of these problems .",
    "the constant @xmath5 can also resolve these issues but unfortunately , in this case inflation never ends and the normal cosmos evolution remains impossible .",
    "scalar field ( composed of kinetic and potential terms coupled to gravity ) is the perfect candidate to produce the dynamical framework and acts as a source for inflation . in field theory , a spin zero particle",
    "is usually defined by a scalar field whereas mathematically , it is a function of space and time .",
    "it has ability to interpret the distribution of lss and the observed anisotropy of the cmb radiations elegantly in inflationary era @xcite .",
    "golovnev et al .",
    "@xcite discussed the vector inflation models based on orthogonal triplet and non - minimally coupled to gravity which show the similar behavior as the scalar fields in a flat universe .",
    "the inflation regime is divided into two parts , i.e. , slow - roll and reheating epochs . during slow - roll period ,",
    "the universe inflates as the interactions among scalar fields while other fields become meaningless and potential energy dominates the kinetic term @xcite .",
    "reheating is the end stage of the inflation where kinetic and potential energies are comparable and universe starts oscillating about minimum potential @xcite .",
    "warm inflation @xcite has an attractive feature of joining the expanding universe with the end of vector inflation .",
    "this motivated researchers to discuss the inflationary scenario in the context of warm inflation . during this regime ,",
    "the dissipation effects become strong enough due to the production of thermal fluctuations of constant density which play a vital role in the formation of initial fluctuations necessary for lss construction . an additional advantage of warm vector inflation",
    "is that the universe stops inflating and smoothly enters into the radiation dominated phase @xcite .",
    "inflation is usually discussed in the context of intermediate and logamediate scenarios .",
    "intermediate inflation is motivated by string or m theory and proved to be the exact solution of the inflationary cosmology containing a particular form of the scale factor @xcite . in intermediate era , the universe expands at the rate slower than the standard de sitter inflation @xmath6 while faster than power - law inflation @xmath7 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the logamediate inflation @xcite is motivated by applying weak general conditions on the indefinite expanding cosmological models .",
    "barrow @xcite applied this scenario to constant , power - law as well as exponential types of scalar field .",
    "the effective potential and various types of potential associated with this model are used in different de models and in supergravity , kaluza - klein as well as string theories , respectively @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that the power spectrum is red or blue tilted for this type of inflation .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , setare and kamali have discussed the warm vector inflation in intermediate as well as logamediate scenarios for frw model and proved the physical compatibility of these results with wmap7 data @xcite through the perturbed parameters . in this paper , we study the above mentioned scenario in the framework of anisotropic universe model , i.e. , locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) bianchi i ( bi ) .",
    "the format of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we construct the field equations from action and calculate the corresponding pressure as well as energy density imposing slow - roll condition .",
    "we also formulate the slow - roll as well as scalar and tensor perturbed parameters . in section",
    "* 3 * , we evaluate the hubble parameter , scalar field as well as slow - roll and perturbed parameters in two regimes ( i ) intermediate inflation ( ii ) logamediate inflation . the inflationary universe is further studied with variable and constant dissipation factor .",
    "the results are summarized in section * 4*.",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the inflationary model using the anisotropic background of the universe .",
    "a massive vector field , non - minimally coupled to gravity is presented by the following action @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 , the field strength @xmath10 and potential @xmath11 are defined as follows @xmath12 this non - minimal coupling of the vector field has an opposite effect , i.e. , it violates the conformal invariance of the massless vector field and forces it to behave just like a minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "the variation of the action with respect to @xmath13 yields the following equations of motion @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "an isotropic model ( frw ) is unsteady near the initial singularity thus unable to explain the early mechanism of the universe .",
    "there is a need of an appropriate geometry which is more concise and general than the isotropic and homogeneous frw universe .",
    "bianchi models are prime and viable models to discuss the behavior of the early universe .",
    "a bi model being the straightforward generalization of the flat frw model is one of the simplest models of the anisotropic universe .",
    "the line element for lrs bi model @xmath16 is given as @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the scale factors along @xmath19-axis and @xmath20-axis , respectively .",
    "this metric can be transformed in the following form using a linear relationship @xmath21 @xcite @xmath22 in this scenario , eq.([1 ] ) leads to @xmath23 @xmath24 where dot represents the time rate of change . applying the condition of homogeneous vector field , i.e. , @xmath25 to eq.([3 ] )",
    ", one can deduce @xmath26 .",
    "another variable @xmath27 is introduced for scalar field in place of @xmath28 .",

    "we have considered the lrs bi universe model with homogeneous vector field which does not contain the off - diagonal terms in the energy - momentum tensor . in order to make the spatial component of the energy - momentum tensor diagonal , we use various fields simultaneously .",
    "therefore , a triplet of the mutually orthogonal vector fields is defined as follows @xcite @xmath37 using the above conditions with an ansatz , @xmath38 in eq.([5 ] ) , the components of the energy - momentum tensor reduce to diagonal form as @xmath39 these equations are similar to the equations which are evaluated in @xcite for massive scalar field .",

    "we assume that the total energy density of the universe is the sum of energy density of the vector field @xmath43 and radiation @xmath44 .",
    "the mechanism of warm vector inflation can be represented by the first field equation ( evolution equation ) and conservation equations given as @xmath45 where @xmath46 stand for dissipation or friction factor and temperature of the thermal bath , respectively .",
    "we assume a suitable form of @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is any constant and @xmath49 can be extracted via quantum field theory method which holds for low temperature @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the inflation interacts with heavy intermediate field ( acts as catalyst ) which could decay into massless field called radiation . here",
    "@xmath50 is taken to be positive ( by second law of thermodynamics ) which implies that the energy density of scalar field decays into radiation density . during inflation era , @xmath51 and the energy density of inflation exceeds to radiation density @xmath52 .",
