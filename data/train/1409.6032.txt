    "this paper studies the discrete - time stochastic switched linear system of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents a finite - dimensional state vector and @xmath5 is a stochastic process taking values in the set of square matrices of an appropriate dimension .",
    "one of its most natural stability notions is almost sure stability  @xcite , which requires that the state @xmath4 converges to the origin with probability one as @xmath6 .",
    "however this stability is difficult to check in practice because it is characterized by a quantity called the top lyapunov exponent , whose computation is in general a hard problem  @xcite .",
    "for example , the necessary and sufficient condition in @xcite is one of the most tractable conditions but can not necessarily be checked with finite computation .",
    "this difficulty has motivated many authors to study another stability , called @xmath1th _ mean stability _ , which requires that the expected value of the @xmath1th power of the norm of the state  @xmath4 converges to  @xmath7 .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the @xmath1th mean stability can be often checked by computing the spectral radius of a matrix that is easy to compute .",
    "recently the authors showed  @xcite that , if each @xmath8 follows an identical probability distribution independently and either @xmath1 is even or the distribution possess a certain invariance property , then the @xmath1th mean stability of the system is characterized by the spectral radius of a matrix , generalizing the results obtained in the literature @xcite . also it is shown that the mean square stability is equivalent to the existence of a certain quadratic lyapunov function .",
    "the derivation of these results depends on an extended version @xcite of _ @xmath0-norm joint spectral radius _",
    "@xcite .    generalizing the above result on lyapunov functions , in this paper",
    "we first show that , for a general even exponent  @xmath1 , the @xmath1th mean stability of @xmath9 is equivalent to the existence of a homogeneous lyapunov function of degree  @xmath1 .",
    "this equivalence is still true for a general @xmath1 provided the distribution possesses a certain invariance property .",
    "imposing that the value of the function decreases along trajectories only in _ expectation _ enables us to construct a lyapunov function even when the system is not stable for an arbitrary switching signal , as opposed to the results in the literature  @xcite , moreover our lyapunov function can be constructed easily by solving a linear matrix inequality or an eigenvalue problem .",
    "then we study a limiting behavior of the @xmath1th mean stability .",
    "it is well known @xcite that , roughly speaking , the @xmath1th mean stability becomes equivalent to almost sure stability in the limit of @xmath10 . as a counterpart of this fact we show that , in the limit of @xmath11 , the @xmath1th mean stability is equivalent to the stability of an associated _ deterministic _ switched system for an arbitrary switching .",
    "this result will be proved by showing an extension of the formulas @xcite that express joint spectral radius as the limit of @xmath0-norm joint spectral radius .",
    "finally we extend the results in @xcite to markovian switched systems , where @xmath8 in is not necessarily identically and independently distributed . again assuming the invariantce property of the markov process we will give a characterization of the @xmath1th mean stability .",
