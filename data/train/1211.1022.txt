    "there are many pulsation instability strips on the hertzsprung - russell diagram , including the dav ( or zz ceti ) instability strip , driven by a hydrogen partial ionization zone in the cool , hydrogen atmosphere ( da ) white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "seismology using the non - radial gravity - mode ( @xmath4-mode ) pulsations of davs has enabled us to constrain the mass , core and envelope composition , rotation rate , and the behavior of convection in these objects ( see reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , the roughly 150 davs known to date have masses between @xmath13 @xmath1 , implying that they all likely contain c / o - cores .",
    "low - mass , he - core wds are likely to pulsate as well , including extremely low - mass ( elm , @xmath14 @xmath1 ) wds @xcite .",
    "elm wds are the byproducts of binary evolution .",
    "mass loss during at least one common - envelope phase has precluded the elm wd from igniting he in its core , and the result is an underweight wd with a core devoid of c / o .",
    "these wds have been known for some time as companions to pulsars , but recently their numbers have grown dramatically as a result of the elm survey , a targeted spectroscopic search for elm wds @xcite .    leveraging the numerous new low - mass wds found by the elm survey , the first putatively he - core elm wd ( sdss j184037.38 + 642312.3 , hereafter j1840 )",
    "was recently discovered to pulsate @xcite .",
    "this @xmath150.17 @xmath1  wd varies at a dominant period of roughly 4698 s , with a high - amplitude ( @xmath16% ) , non - sinusoidal pulse shape .",
    "the discovery of pulsating elm wds provides the first chance to apply the tools of asteroseismology to these low - mass , presumed he - core wds ; we have an exciting opportunity to probe the internal structure of these exotic compact objects @xcite .    here",
    "we announce the discovery of pulsations in two new elm wds : sdss j111215.82 + 111745.0 ( hereafter j1112 ) and sdss j151826.68 + 065813.2 ( hereafter j1518 ) .",
    "these objects bring to three the number of pulsating elm wds known , further populating the empirical instability strip of elm wds .",
    "these objects belong to an extension of the instability strip from the c / o - core davs , and are most likely driven by the same mechanism acting in the classical zz ceti stars .",
    "in section  [ sec : j1112 ] we detail our discovery of pulsations in j1112 .",
    "we outline our new spectroscopic and photometric observations of this elm wd , and provide a robust identification of its highest - amplitude periodicities .",
    "we also detail evidence for short - period variability which may be evidence of acoustic ( @xmath3-mode ) pulsations in this elm wd . in section  [ sec : j1518 ] we describe the discovery of variability in the elm wd j1518 and list the significant periods determined from our relatively sparse coverage so far .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of these discoveries in section  [ sec : end ] .",
    "@xcite presented a preliminary fit of @xmath5  @xmath17 k and @xmath7  @xmath18 based on a single spectrum of this @xmath19 mag sdss dereddened @xmath4-band magnitude ] wd from the flwo 1.5 m telescope using the fast spectrograph @xcite .",
    "we have obtained an additional 26 spectra using the flwo 1.5 m telescope and an additional 6 spectra using the blue channel spectrograph @xcite on the 6.5 m mmt .",
    "the time - series spectroscopy reveals that j1112 is short - period binary , as described below .",
    "we have phased ( see section  [ sec : j1112rv ] ) and co - added our new spectroscopic observations to determine the atmospheric parameters of the primary elm wd visible in j1112 .",
    "our observations cover a wavelength range from @xmath20  .",
    "the model atmospheres used for this analysis are described at length in @xcite and employ the new stark broadening profiles from @xcite .",
    "models where convective energy transport becomes important are computed using the ml2/@xmath21 = 0.8 prescription of the mixing - length theory ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , since we are dealing with elm wds , the model grid needed to be extended down to lower surface gravities .",
    "thus the model grid used in this analysis covers the ranges in @xmath5  from 4000 to 30,000 k in steps ranging from 250 to 5000 k and @xmath7  from 5.0 to 8.0 in steps of 0.25 dex .",
    "the method used for fitting the observations relies on the so - called spectroscopic technique , described in @xcite and references therein .",
    "the main difference here is that we fit the balmer lines we observe up to and including h12 , as the considerably lower surface gravity means that these higher balmer lines are still observed .",
    "since the higher balmer lines are sensitive mostly to @xmath7  ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) , the inclusion of these extra lines further constrains our measurement of the surface gravity .",
    "the uncertainty for each parameter is calculated by combining the internal error , which is the dominant source of uncertainty , obtained from the covariance matrix of the fitting algorithm with the external error , obtained from multiple observations of the same object , estimated for da stars at 1.2% in @xmath5  and 0.038 dex in @xmath7  ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the effect on the uncertainties caused by different values of s / n are included in the internal error .",
    "our final fit to the phased and co - added spectra of j1112 is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : j1112rv ] and yield @xmath5  @xmath6 k and @xmath7  @xmath8 .",
    "this corresponds to a mass of @xmath150.17 @xmath1  using the he - core models of @xcite .",
    "in addition to the balmer series , the ca ii k line at 3933   is also observed in the spectra of j1112 . for the purposes of this analysis",
    ", we simply exclude the wavelength range where that metal line is present so that it does not affect either the normalization of the individual balmer lines nor the actual fits themselves .",
    "this ca feature phases with the radial velocity variations of the balmer lines , and is thus not interstellar but rather in the photosphere of the wd",
    ". we will not discuss this ca feature further in this paper .",
    "the bottom two panels of figure  [ fig : j1112rv ] show the radial velocity curve of the 32 spectra we have obtained of j1112 .",
    "we compute the orbital elements of this single - lined binary using the code of @xcite , which weights each velocity measurements by its associated error .",
    "our spectroscopic observations find that j1112 is in a @xmath22 hr orbital period binary with a @xmath23 km s@xmath24  radial velocity semi - amplitude .",
    "this yields a mass function of @xmath25 @xmath1 , which constrains the minimum mass of the unseen companion to @xmath26 @xmath1  assuming a 0.17 @xmath1  primary .",
    "the nature of this companion has no direct bearing on the discovery of pulsations in the primary elm wd , but it may be contribute enough flux to partially contaminate the spectral fits of the primary .",
    "it also suggests that unless the system is inclined to less than @xmath27 degrees ( which would happen at random less than 15% of the time ) , the companion is most likely another he - core wd with a mass below 0.45 @xmath1 .",
    "similar single - lined elm wds with likely he - core wd companions have been found in the elm survey ( i.e. , sdss j1005 + 3550 in @xcite ) .",
    "we have folded our photometric observations on this orbital period and do not see evidence of eclipses , at a limit of 0.5% .",
    "this suggests that the inclination of the system is @xmath28 degrees , although this does not significantly constrain the nature of the unseen companion .",
    "we obtained high - speed photometric observations of j1112 at the mcdonald observatory over four months , from 2012 january to 2012 april , for a total of more than 70.2 hr of coverage .",
    "we used the argos instrument , a frame - transfer ccd mounted at the prime focus of the 2.1 m otto struve telescope @xcite , to obtain @xmath29 s exposures on j1112 ; a full journal of observations can be found in table  [ tab : jour ] .",

    "none of these periods are an integer harmonic of the @xmath67 hr ( @xmath68 s ) orbital period . given our cited uncertainties , @xmath44 , the closest , is more than 8-@xmath69 from @xmath70 .",

    "instead , we conclude that these are global , non - radial @xmath4-mode pulsations driven to observability by the same mechanism at work in classical davs @xcite .",
    "the timescale of this variability is considerably longer than for the pulsations seen in c / o - core davs .",
    "however , it is consistent with the expectation that the periods of pulsation modes roughly scale with the dynamical timescale for the whole star , @xmath71 , and are thus much longer for the low - surface - gravity elm wds .",
    "in addition to the relatively high - amplitude , long - period variability observed in j1112 , we see evidence for low - amplitude variability on much shorter timescales .",

    "figure  [ fig : j1112pmodes ] shows a zoomed - in portion of the ft around 134.3 s and 107.6 s using our entire data set .",
    "this variability is coherent enough to reach significant amplitude over four months of observations .",
    "some of our longest individual runs also evidence this variability , such as the 6.5 hr run on 2012 jan 27 ( with a @xmath75 mma signal at @xmath76 s ) and the 3.5 hr run on 2012 feb 1 ( with a @xmath77 mma signal at @xmath78 s ) .",

    "this variability is too short to be explained as @xmath4-mode pulsations without invoking implausibly high values of the spherical harmonic degree .",
    "a recent non - adiabatic pulsation analysis relevant to low - mass wds by @xcite found that @xmath4-modes of low radial order ( and thus the shortest period ) are stable to pulsations and should not be driven to observability .",
    "their calculations found that unstable @xmath4-modes in a 0.17 @xmath1  wd have radial orders @xmath83 and periods longer than 1100 s. even if we ignore their conclusion that an @xmath84 , @xmath85 mode is stable , they find this lowest radial order mode has a period @xmath15249.5 s. similarly , @xcite also found that an @xmath84 , @xmath85 @xmath4-mode for a 0.17 @xmath1  wd has a @xmath15245 s period .",
    "the short - period variability seen in j1112 is also inconsistent with nonlinear combination frequencies present in the non - sinusoidal light curves of many classical davs @xcite .",
    "for one , the light curve of j1112 is extremely sinusoidal .",
    "additionally , the short - period variability is not a multiple of any of the five low - frequency modes , nor is it a combination of different modes .    instead",
    ", we propose that this variability is caused by acoustic or pressure ( @xmath3-mode ) pulsations driven to observability in j1112 .",
    "@xcite find that low - order @xmath3-modes are pulsationally unstable , and have periods ranging from @xmath86 s for their @xmath87 models of a 0.17 @xmath1  he - core wd .",
    "the 134.3 s period we observe in j1112 is slightly longer than this predicted range , which suggests some uncertainty in identifying the true nature of these instabilities .",

    "however , since that work finds that @xmath4-modes with periods shorter than 1100 s are stable to pulsations , @xmath3-mode pulsations remain the most likely explanation for the short - period variability in j1112 .",
    "( it also remains possible that the 134.3 s periodicity is a radial fundamental mode for the star . )",
    "while we have not yet matched the observed periods in these first three pulsating elm wds to full asteroseismic models , we can begin to assess some of their observed properties .",
    "we are extremely interested in finding pulsation periods that are consecutive radial overtones , since the asymptotic period spacings of @xmath4-modes are a direct probe of the overall mass of the star .",
    "we expect that low - mass pulsating wds will have relatively high mean period spacings . for the relevant he - core wd models",
    ", @xcite find that 0.17 @xmath1  wds have dipole forward period spacings of roughly 104 s , compared to period spacings of 64 s for a 0.45  @xmath1  he - core wd .",
    "similarly , @xcite find an 89 s mean period spacing for a 0.17 @xmath1  wd .    the rich and relatively simple pulsation spectrum of j1112 offers an excellent opportunity to search for consecutive radial overtones .",
    "the two shortest - period @xmath4-mode pulsations in this star , at 1884.6 s and 1792.9 s , differ by 91.7 s. if these are @xmath84 modes of consecutive radial order , this would be excellent direct confirmation that this is indeed a roughly 0.17  @xmath1  he - core wd .",
    "however , a full asteroseismic investigation is warranted to confirm that these are indeed consecutive modes . that hinges on constructing enough he - core wd models with sufficiently different hydrogen layer masses .",
    "additionally , j1112 ( relatively sinusoidal ) and j1518 ( extremely nonlinear ) offer strongly contrasting pulse shapes .",
    "it has been suggested that the large nonlinear distortions in the emergent flux are due to the changing depth of the star s convection zone during a pulsation cycle @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the method of @xcite could be used on j1518 to infer the thermal response timescale and thereby the average depth of the convection zone in this highly non - sinusoidal dav .",
    "distortions in the light curve may also be the result of other processes , such as the nonlinear response of the emergent flux to temperature perturbations @xcite .",
    "finally , we can put all three pulsating elm wds into context by calculating their weighted mean periods ( wmps ) , as defined by @xcite . in the classical c / o - core zz ceti stars ,",
    "cooler wds typically have longer wmps .",
    "this generally holds for the pulsating elm wds , as well : the coolest of the three , j1840 , has a wmp @xmath153722 s. j1112 and j1518 have wmps @xmath152288 s and @xmath152404 s , respectively . by comparison , no classical c / o - core dav known before the discovery of pulsating elm wds had a wmp @xmath146 s ( or @xmath5  @xmath0 10,000 k ) .",

    "the addition of two new pulsating elm wds aids in constraining the theoretical low - mass wd instability strip .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we use the criterion that @xmath173 for the longest period mode that is excited , where @xmath174 is the mode period and the timescale @xmath175 describes the heat capacity of the convection zone as a function of the local photospheric flux , which we compute from a grid of models , where @xmath176 is the thermal timescale at the base of the convection zone .",
    "the average value of @xmath177 is often denoted as @xmath178 . ] . using the traditional value of @xmath179s",
    ", we find that the convection parameters ml2/@xmath180 provide a good match to the blue edge for the normal - mass davs , but that extrapolating this relation to the pulsating elm wds yields a blue edge which is somewhat hotter than the observations ( see the dotted blue line in figure  [ fig : search ] ) .",
    "the models of @xcite find that only @xmath4-mode periods greater than @xmath151000 s are excited , but using this criterion only moves the blue edge a small amount closer to the location of the observed pulsators ( about 130 k for a given surface gravity ) .",
    "it is possible there are additional mechanisms at work that move the blue edge to cooler temperatures . using a less efficient prescription for convection , such as ml2/@xmath181 , will shift the blue edge to cooler temperatures , as seen in @xcite , whose blue edge we include in figure  [ fig : search ] .",
    "we are also still dominated by small number statistics , and perhaps we have simply not yet found any hotter pulsating low - mass wds .",
    "it remains difficult to predict a theoretical red edge for even the classical c / o - core davs , so we have not extended it to low - mass wds , and instead provide a portion of the red - edge established by @xcite .",
    "we have discovered the second and third pulsating elm wds as part of a search for such objects at the mcdonald observatory .",
    "spectroscopic fits to both objects indicate each has a mass @xmath0 0.25 @xmath1 , and thus both likely harbor a helium core .",
