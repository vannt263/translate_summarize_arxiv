    "the b - meson system promises to yield a fertile testing ground of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the large data samples which will be acquired over the next decade at cesr , the tevatron , hera , the slac and kek b - factories , as well as the lhc will furnish the means to probe the sm at an unprecedented level of precision .",
    "it is well - known@xcite that precision measurements of low - energy processes can provide an insight to very high energy scales via the indirect effects of new interactions . as such",
    ", the @xmath0 sector offers a complementary probe of new physics , and in some cases may yield constraints which surpass those from direct collider searches or exclude entire classes of models .",
    "new physics may manifest itself in the b system in several ways , for example , inconsistencies with the sm may be found in measurements of ( i ) the unitarity triangle , ( ii ) rare decays , or ( iii ) precision electroweak measurements of the decay @xmath1 . in the first case ,",
    "the angles of the unitarity triangle , commonly denoted as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , may reveal the existence of new physics in three distinct manners :    * @xmath7 , * @xmath8 , but the individual values of the angles are outside of their sm ranges , * @xmath8 , but the values of the angles are inconsistent with the measured sides of the triangle .",
    "these potential deviations may originate from new interactions in tree - level @xmath0 decays , or by the virtual effects of new physics in loop mediated processes ( , @xmath9 mixing or penguin decays of the @xmath0 ) , with or without the presence of new phases .",
    "since the scale of the new physics is expected to be large compared to @xmath10 , it is anticipated that additional tree - level contributions to @xmath0 decay are suppressed .",
    "further consequences of new degrees of freedom in the unitarity triangle are discussed by fleischer.@xcite    here , we concentrate on the loop effects of new interactions in flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath0 decays and in @xmath1 .",
    "we note that most classes of models which induce large effects in the fcnc decays also affect @xmath9 mixing , and that measurements of several different rare decays may elucidate the origin of new interactions .",
    "@xmath2 transitions provide an excellent probe of new indirect effects as they only occur at loop level in the sm , and they have relatively large rates for loop processes due to the massive internal - top quark and the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) structure of the contributing penguin and box diagrams .",
    "also , long distance effects are expected to play less of a role due to the heavy @xmath0 mass , and hence rare processes are essentially short distance dominated .",
    "the sm continues to provide an excellent description of precision electroweak data,@xcite where the few ( small ) deviations may be attributed to normal statistical fluctuations and not neccessarily to new physics . in particular , the observables which characterize the @xmath3 couplings , the ratio @xmath11 and the forward - backward asymmetry parameter @xmath12 , are now measured to be only @xmath13 away from their sm expectations.@xcite this is in contrast to only a couple of years ago when @xmath14 was measured to be anomalously high , yielding hopeful indications of physics beyond the sm.@xcite in fact , the @xmath3 vertex has long been recognized as being sensitive to new physics which may not affect the light fermion vertices , and now constrains the parameter space of some models.@xcite a model independent fit to possible shifts in the left- and right - handed @xmath3 couplings is presented in fig .",
    "[ bbar ] . writing these couplings as @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents the coupling shifts from their sm values , and @xmath17 is the b - quark effective weak mixing angle",
    ", we use zfitter4.9 to calculate the sm predictions ( taking @xmath18 gev , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ) and perform a fit to the full slc / lep @xmath1 data set . here",
    "we see that the data is well described by the sm , with a slight preference for a heavier higgs .",
    "the observation@xcite of radiative penguin mediated processes , in both the exclusive @xmath21 and inclusive  channels , has placed the study of rare @xmath0 decays on a new footing and has provided powerful constraints on classes of models@xcite .",
    "the effective field theory for @xmath2 transitions is summarized at this meeting by ali@xcite , however , we briefly review the features which are essential to the remainder of this talk . incorporating the qcd corrections ,",
    "these transitions are governed by the hamiltonian @xmath22 where the @xmath23 are a complete set of renormalized operators of dimension six or less which mediate these transitions and are catalogued in , , ref .",
    "the @xmath24 represent the corresponding wilson coefficients which are evaluated perturbatively at the electroweak scale , where the matching conditions are imposed , and then evolved down to the renormalization scale @xmath25 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath26 in the sm are given by the inami - lim functions @xcite .",
    "for  this formalism leads to the physical decay amplitude ( neglecting @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) @xmath30 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 represents the momentum transferred to the lepton pair . the next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    "analysis for this decay has been performed in buras  @xcite , where it is stressed that a scheme independent result can only be obtained by including the leading and next - to - leading logarithmic corrections to @xmath32 while retaining only the leading logarithms in the remaining wilson coefficients .",
    "the leading residual scale dependence in @xmath32 is cancelled by that contained in the matrix element of @xmath33 , yielding an effective value @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , the effective value for @xmath35 refers to the leading order scheme independent result , and we note that the operator @xmath36 does not renormalize . the numerical estimates ( in the naive dimensional regularization scheme ) for these coefficients are displayed in table [ coeffval ] .",
    "the reduced scale dependence of the nlo- versus the lo - corrected coefficients is reflected in the deviations @xmath37 and @xmath38 as @xmath39 is varied .",
    "we find that the coefficients are much less sensitive to the remaining input parameters , with @xmath40 , varying @xmath41 @xcite , and @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the resulting inclusive branching fractions ( which are computed by scaling the width for  to that for @xmath0 semi - leptonic decay ) are found to be @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 for @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , respectively , taking into account the above input parameter ranges , as well as @xmath48  @xcite , and @xmath49 .",
