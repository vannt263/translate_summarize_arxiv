    "it is well known how to calculate polarization of a final electron in framework of quantum field theory , see for example @xcite ,  65 . if we are interested in polarization of intermediate fermion , first of all we need to give an accurate definition for this value .",
    "however , the concept of polarization in intermediate state is used for a long time in particle physics .",
    "one can recall the account of polarization in method of equivalent photons @xcite .",
    "another example  experimental and theoretical activity concerning of polarization of @xmath0-quark produced in hadron collisions , see experimental papers @xcite and reviews @xcite .",
    "note that in the last case the naive definition for polarization is used in analogy with on - mass - shell particle .",
    "the first part of this paper concerns to technical aspects of calculation of a fermion polarization .",
    "namely , we discuss the problem of search for a complete polarization axis for the final bispinor .",
    "it can be shown that the found axis ( @xmath1-vector @xmath2 ) coincides with polarization of final fermion @xmath3 calculated by the standard way , for pure initial state .",
    "since the proposed method uses an amplitude but not its square , it can be applied also for intermediate state . in this case",
    "one should simply change an energy projector in a problem to the off - shell one .",
    "the other part of this paper is devoted to application of proposed method for intermediate fermion .",
    "it is known that the on - mass - shell fermion density matrix consists of two factors : the energy projector and spin density matrix @xcite . in order to define the fermion polarization in an intermediate state ,",
    "first of all one should introduce some off - shell energy projectors . here",
    "may exist different variants , but there is no some commonly accepted definition .",
    "for example , in the known method of quasi - real electrons @xcite the energy poles are accompanied by rather artificial energy projectors which are not orthogonal to each other .    to give exact meaning for fermion polarization in an intermediate state",
    ", we suggest to use the covariant form of propagator eq . , which contains the orthogonal off - shell projection operators .",
    "this view of free propagator is a particular case of the spectral representation and can be generalized with account of interactions . in ref .",
    "@xcite the spectral representation of fermion propagator in the theory with @xmath4-parity violation was constructed .",
    "corresponding energy projection operators ( see ) differ from the standard off - shell projectors and also contain @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , in such theory the standard spin projectors do not commute with propagator and have to be modified as well @xcite .",
    "the use of spectral representation for dressed propagator gives natural definition for polarization of fermion in an intermediate state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : nonrel ] is devoted to discussion of the problem of looking for complete polarization axis for non - relativistic electron and its connection with calculation of a final electron polarization as such .",
    "the equivalence of these two problems is shown that allows to compute final electron polarization using the amplitude but not its square .    in section  [ sec : rel ] similar problem is discussed for bispinor .",
    "the equivalence of these two problems is shown for relativistic electron that in fact is consequence of similar property for two - dimensional spinors .",
    "as an example the scattering of electron in external field is considered .    in section  [ sec : prop - spectral ] the eigenvalue problem for inverse propagator and corresponding spectral representation are discussed .",
    "this representation leads to covariant separation of positive and negative energy poles which are accompanied by the off - shell energy projectors orthogonal to each other .",
    "the presence of @xmath5 in vertex leads to modification ( dressing ) of both standard energy and spin projectors .",
    "section  [ sec : intermed - fermion - polariz ] is devoted to application of the section  [ sec : rel ] method for fermion in an intermediate state . if to use the spectral representation for propagator , the problem of search for a complete polarization axis allows to find polarization vectors for particle and antiparticle contributions .",
    "let us note that the pure spin density matrices correspond to these contributions .    in conclusions",
    "we briefly discuss the obtained results .",
    "some technical details are grouped in appendix .",
    "assume that electron from initial state characterized by twice the mean spin vector @xmath6 is turned into final state characterized by vector @xmath7 ( polarization selected by a detector ) , then transition amplitude is @xmath8 here @xmath9 is eigenstate of operator @xmath10 : @xmath11 and similarly @xmath12 is eigenstate of operator @xmath13 .",
    "the operator @xmath14 in the general case is equal to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are complex parameters . for the sake of definiteness",
    "we choose @xmath18 where @xmath19 is unit real vector such that @xmath20    it is easy to calculate the @xmath21 , i.e. the polarization of final state as such ( see  140 in @xcite ) : @xmath22 note that eqs . and are written for pure quantum states for which @xmath23 .",
    "but the result has exactly the same form both for pure and mixed initial states , when @xmath24 .",
    "few words to clarify the answer . in order to calculate a final electron polarization",
    "as such one needs the transition probability which is proportional to square of matrix element @xmath25{f_{fi}}^{2 } = { \\mathrm{sp}}\\bigl ( \\frac{1+{\\bm \\sigma}{\\bm \\zeta } ' } { 2}\\,\\hat{f}\\ :    \\frac{1+{\\bm \\sigma}{\\bm \\zeta}}{2}\\,\\hat{f}^{\\dag } \\bigr ) = a + { \\bm b}{\\bm \\zeta } ' =    a \\big(1 + \\frac{{\\bm b}}{a } { \\bm \\zeta}'\\big ) .",
    "\\label{me2}\\ ] ] here the terms containing detector polarization @xmath7 and independent of it are presented .",
    "the coefficients are calculated as : @xmath26 the matrix element square represents in fact the projection of spin density matrix of scattered electron ( which is characterized by some vector @xmath21 ) onto the detector spin density matrix @xmath27 .",
    "thus , comparing with @xmath28 one should identify the final electron polarization @xmath21 as following : @xmath29 and we obtain the answer .",
    "let us take a close look on the matrix @xmath30 which will be necessary below . using @xmath31-matrix decomposition @xmath32 one can see that the matrix is determined by the same parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 : @xmath35      let us consider an arbitrary two - dimensional spinor @xmath36 it is known ( see  59 in @xcite ) that for any spinor @xmath37 there exists an axis of complete polarization , i.e. there exists such unit vector @xmath6 that @xmath38    in scattering process described by the amplitude a new state appears @xmath39 where @xmath37 is an arbitrary spinor .",
    "let us consider the problem of search for complete polarization axis @xmath40 of spinor @xmath41 @xmath42    it is convenient to rewrite this equation in an equivalent form @xmath43    recall that amplitude contains a spinor with definite polarization , so in eq .",
    "vector @xmath6 is unit one ( in contrast to ) . however , if to use a pure spin density matrix of initial state ( @xmath44 ) within the spur in , then both problems , and , are equivalent and two vectors coincide : @xmath45 .",
    "let us show this equivalence .",
    "suppose that we have solved the problem , i.e. the vector @xmath40 is known .",
    "take hermitian adjoint of the previous equation : @xmath46 multiplying eqs .",
    ", by each other one obtains the following matrix relation arisen after multiplication coincides up to a factor with @xmath47 .",
    "we come to after factor cancellation ( recall that @xmath37 is an arbitrary spinor ) . ] @xmath48 here the known matrix @xmath49 has been appeared and previous equation demonstrates its evident property : @xmath50 if to recall the matrix @xmath49 decomposition , we get two equations for vector of final polarization @xmath21 at the given @xmath40 @xmath51    writing down two relations in detail : @xmath52 it is easy to see that the only solution is @xmath45 .    on the other hand , if we know vector @xmath21 then from it follows that @xmath53 .",
    "thus we see that for scattering of non - relativistic electron these two problems : calculation of the final electron polarization vector ( for pure state ) and looking for complete polarization axis are equivalent .",
    "so the final electron polarization can be calculated from scattering amplitude instead of its square .",
    "the scheme outlined above can be applied also for scattering of relativistic electrons .",
    "assume that electron from initial state characterized by momentum @xmath54 and polarization vector @xmath55 is turned into final state characterized by vectors @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( polarization selected by a detector ) , then transition amplitude is @xmath58 here @xmath59 is solution of dirac equation @xmath60 and matrix @xmath61 characterizes the transition process .    in order to find the final electron polarization it is necessary to calculate the transition probability which is proportional to square of matrix element @xmath62 here we write down separately terms dependent on detector polarization @xmath63 and independent on it .",
    "since @xmath64 , only transverse part of vector @xmath65 remains in @xmath66    the matrix element square is in fact the projection of scattered electron density matrix ( its spin part is defined by vector @xmath67 ) onto the detector density matrix @xmath68",
    ". thus comparison of with @xmath69 gives the final electron polarization @xmath67 as such : @xmath70    let us introduce short notations for final state projectors @xmath71 and similarly for initial state .",
    "the matrix element square in these notations is @xmath72 here we have introduced necessary for further matrix ( analogue of matrix in the case of non - relativistic electron ) @xmath73 the coefficients @xmath16 and @xmath65 in are calculated like @xmath74 and the orthogonality property @xmath75 is seen from it .",
    "let us find the decomposition of the matrix @xmath49 in @xmath76-matrix basis .",
    "simple calculations show that all coefficients are easily expressed by means of @xmath77 , @xmath16 , @xmath65 except of projection on @xmath78 .",
    "the decomposition has view @xmath79.\\ ] ] however , the coefficient @xmath80 is related with parameters @xmath16 , @xmath65 too . to see it , let us note that @xmath49 has the following properties @xmath81 and the most general form of such matrix ( see appendix  [ sec : matrix - prob ] ) is @xmath82 containing an arbitrary parameter @xmath83 and arbitrary 4-vector @xmath84 orthogonal to momentum .    comparison of expression with the most general form fixes @xmath78 term . as a result",
    "the matrix @xmath49 looks like @xmath85 recall that @xmath86 is final electron polarization .      after scattering described by the amplitude we have a new state @xmath87",
    "let us consider the problem of search for complete polarization axis @xmath88 of bispinor of scattered electron @xmath89 we know in advance that this problem has a solution ( see appendix  [ sec : bispinor - polar - axis - existence ] ) .",
    "let us rewrite the equation in equivalent form @xmath90    let us show that ( as in the non - relativistic case ) the complete polarization axis @xmath2 coincides with @xmath3 .",
    "let us take hermitian adjoint of previous equation and multiply it by @xmath91 from right @xmath92 multiplying both equations by each other and substituting the density matrix of initial electron @xmath93 one gets matrix relation @xmath94 note that here the known matrix @xmath49 , has been appeared .",
    "this relation can be transformed into equation connecting the complete polarization axis @xmath88 and final electron polarization @xmath95 .    as it follows from previous relation the matrix @xmath49 satisfies equations @xmath96",
    "if to use for @xmath49 the expression found above we obtain the following two equations @xmath97 both expressions are `` under the observation '' of singular matrix @xmath98 but in the relation linking @xmath88 and @xmath95 it does not play any role . let us multiply spin matrices @xmath99 it immediately follows that these two vectors coincide @xmath100 .",
    "so for relativistic electron there is also the equivalence of these two problems : calculation of the scattered fermion polarization , ( for pure initial state ) and looking for complete polarization axis of bispinor .",
    "the distinction of the problem of looking for complete polarization axis is the use of amplitude instead of its square .",
    "this makes possible to apply the same method for calculation of fermion polarization both for final and intermediate states .      by way of simple example",
    "let us consider single scattering of electron in an external field .",
    "we will check the found above equivalence of two problems and discuss some features .",
    "matrix element has form in which vertex factor @xmath61 contains fourier transform of the external field and corresponding @xmath76-matrix",
    ".    the problem of looking for axis can be rewritten in equivalent view @xmath101 where @xmath37 is an arbitrary bispinor .",
    "since this is an inverse problem ( reconstruction of an operator ) , @xmath102 generally speaking can depend on bispinor @xmath37 .",
    "however , the found equivalence @xmath100 and expression for @xmath3 tell that vector @xmath2 does not depend on bispinor @xmath37 .",
    "it means that can be rewritten as a matrix problem @xmath103 the matrix formulation of the problem gives rather convenient method to find vector @xmath2 : one should decompose in @xmath76-matrix basis and seek for vector @xmath88 as an expansion over available vectors and @xmath104 vertices these are vectors @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath55 and expansion looks as @xmath107 for @xmath108 and @xmath16 vertices there exists also vector @xmath109 and expansion is : @xmath110 case of linear dependence of vectors needs special consideration . ] .",
    "we checked that for external fields of different kinds ( @xmath111 , @xmath104 , @xmath108 , @xmath16 ) the solution of the problem coincides with final fermion polarization calculated according to ( for definite polarization of initial fermion , @xmath112 ) .",
    "we will present here solutions of the problem for scalar and vector vertices    * @xmath113 @xmath114 * @xmath115 @xmath116    let us emphasize that expressions , for polarization of final electron obtained for pure initial state holds for mixed state too .",
    "note also that for electron scattering in external field the initial pure spin state leads to definite polarization of final state .",
    "it is not evident in advance , quite the contrary , it would be natural to expect the appearance of a mixed final state in this case but calculations of amplitude square demonstrates this .",
    "both these facts are consequence of the equivalence of two problems : @xmath100 , discussed above .",
    "we want to apply the problem of looking for complete polarization axis to the case of fermion in an intermediate state .",
    "all aforesaid is easily extended for the case of virtual fermions if to use a spectral representation of propagator .    in order to construct this representation",
    "one needs to solve eigenvalue problem for inverse propagator @xmath117 . since there is convenient @xmath76-matrix basis",
    ", one can solve a matrix problem : to look for eigenprojectors @xmath118 and eigenvalues @xmath119 @xmath120 having solved this problem , i.e. having found eigenvalues @xmath121 and orthogonal system of eigenprojectors @xmath122 @xmath123 we can construct the spectral representation of inverse propagator @xmath124 if the system of projectors is complete , then this expression can be easily reversed and propagator looks like this : @xmath125 i.e. propagator poles are zeroes of eigenvalues @xmath121 .",
    "let us consider how the propagator spectral representation is shown up in particular cases .",
    "the eigenprojectors @xmath122 for a bare propagator are the known off - shell projector operators @xmath126 @xmath127 where @xmath128 is center - of - mass energy . as a result the bare propagator @xmath129",
    "is shown up as a sum of poles with positive and negative energies .",
    "it is necessary to stress that we have covariant separation of poles @xmath130 because @xmath128 is invariant mass .",
    "besides that , since fermion and anti - fermion have opposite parities the representation sorts out contributions by parity .    with account of interaction",
    "the inverse propagator takes the form @xmath131 where @xmath132 is self - energy contribution . for dressed propagator",
    "the spectral representation looks differently depending on interaction .    *",
    "if theory does not have @xmath5 in a vertex , then @xmath132 contains unit matrix and @xmath133 @xmath134 where @xmath135 . in this case eigenprojectors coincide with the such for bare propagator and the propagator spectral representation has form @xmath136 * in theory with @xmath5 the self - energy contribution also has @xmath5 terms @xmath137 and eigenprojectors @xmath122 do not coincide with @xmath126 . in this case",
    "the eigenprojectors take a more complicated form @xcite : @xmath138 and eigenvalues @xmath139 are @xmath140    an essential aspect related with the completeness of eigenprojectors system is the existence of spin projectors commuting with propagator .",
    "the existence of such projectors follows simply from counting of degrees of freedom in the problem .",
    "however , the standard spin projectors @xmath141 cease to commute with propagator in the presence of @xmath5 in a vertex .",
    "nevertheless , there exist the generalized ( dressed ) spin projectors @xcite closely related with eigenprojectors and having all desired properties @xmath142    note that @xmath143 and @xmath144 have the same matrix factor @xmath145 which possesses the following property . without interaction ( @xmath146 ) or in theory with parity conservation ( @xmath147 ) this factor turns into unit matrix @xmath148 . as a consequence the projectors @xmath143 and",
    "@xmath144 return to the standard ( bare ) form .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen that `` under the observation '' of energy eigenprojector @xmath143 the spin projector is significantly simplified @xmath149    the problem of looking for complete polarization axis of bispinor is naturally generalized for the case of virtual fermion .",
    "using free propagator one needs only to change projector @xmath150 in to one of off - shell projectors @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",
    "the problem of looking for complete polarization axis is turned into that : @xmath153 and ( see appendix  [ sec : bispinor - polar - axis - existence ] ) such problem also has solution : for any bispinor @xmath154 there exists a vector @xmath155 , @xmath156 .",
    "the aforesaid is also true for dressed propagator in theory with @xmath5 as well .",
    "let us write down the problem of looking for complete polarization axis for dressed energy and spin projectors , : @xmath157 the dressed energy projectors in the case of @xmath158 conservation can be rewritten in form ( it may be considered as @xmath76-matrices transformation @xmath159 , see details in appendix  [ sec : gamma ] ) @xmath160 the dressed spin projector can be presented by the same way @xmath161 thereafter the problem of looking for axis takes form : @xmath162 so the problem for dressed energy projectors @xmath163 is reduced to the problem , involving the bare off - shell projectors @xmath164 . as a result",
    "one can conclude that for the problem also exists the axis of complete polarization @xmath165 .",
    "the spectral representation of propagator , where the orthogonal off - shell projectors are arisen allows to give an accurate definition of fermion polarization in an intermediate state .",
    "thereafter the generalization of the problem of looking for axis ( replacing projectors by the off - shell ones ) yields the recipe of polarization calculation in an intermediate state .",
    "consider some process with intermediate fermion is born in @xmath166-channel . here",
    "the external boson lines correspond either to some on - mass - shell particles or to external field .",
    "the corresponding amplitude looks as @xmath167    for the case of bare propagator or theory without @xmath5 the fermion propagator in the intermediate state has form @xmath168 where @xmath126 are off - shell energy projectors .",
    "if to recall the problem of looking for complete polarization axis involving @xmath126 , the propagator in the amplitude can be rewritten as following @xmath169    this gives a natural definition for polarization of fermion in an intermediate state .",
    "polarization vectors @xmath165 are different for poles with positive and negative energies .",
    "it is not so evident that spin density matrices in are pure ones : @xmath170 , however , it follows from the problem of looking for axis .",
    "it is possible to calculate polarization vector either with the help of the problem of looking for axis or by analogy with with the use of spur : @xmath171 it seems that the second way is technically simpler . as indicated above the formula for polarization @xmath165 calculated for pure state holds for mixed initial state also .",
    "let us take a look now on the case of the theory with @xmath5 in vertex . in this case dressed fermion propagator in intermediate state may be represented as @xmath172 where @xmath173 are the energy projectors . using the problem one can see that the dressed propagator inside the diagram acquires spin projectors @xmath174",
    "it should be pointed out that dressed energy projectors @xmath143 presented here contain self - energy contributions and should be renormalized .",
    "the main statement of the work is that the final fermion polarization as such can be calculated by a non - standard way , namely by using the problem of search for complete polarization axis of bispinor .",
    "we have shown that these two problems are equivalent .",
    "it is unlikely that the problem leads to more simple calculations , rather opposite , the calculation of spurs in the standard approach is a routine operation which is successfully performed by a computer .",
    "however , in the problem of looking for axis the amplitude is used instead of its square .",
    "this allows to apply this problem to find polarization of fermion in an intermediate state .",
    "the essential moment is the use of propagator spectral representation , , .",
    "this approach leads to the system of orthogonal off - shell projectors and allows to give clear definition for fermion polarization in an intermediate state .",
    "thus it is possible to use either free propagator or dressed one , including the theory with @xmath5 in a vertex .    when a propagator is written in form of the spectral representation it is possible to use the problem of looking for axis to calculate the off - mass - shell polarization .",
    "indeed , in the problem of final electron polarization ( on - mass - shell ) the energy projector is changed to the off - shell one . as a result",
    "the propagator inside of a diagram takes view where spin density matrices correspond to complete polarization .    the fact that , for example , the projector @xmath175 of positive energy state in is accompanied by completely polarized spin density matrix @xmath176 , @xmath177 is not evident in advance and is the result of the problem of looking for axis .    the evident application of suggested approach",
    "is concerned with @xmath0-quark polarization but it needs single consideration .",
    "we are grateful to v.g .",
    "serbo for fruitful discussions and participation in the beginning of the work .",
    "we want to find the most general form of matrix @xmath49 obeying equations @xmath178 for this purpose we decompose the matrix @xmath49 @xmath179 and determine its coefficients .",
    "computing coefficients at @xmath5 in relations one obtain pair of equations @xmath180 from which it immediately follows that @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "next , determining coefficients at @xmath183 in these relations we come to equations @xmath184 hence it follows that @xmath185 .",
    "finally , calculating coefficients at @xmath78 in any of relations we determine @xmath80 : @xmath186 thus the matrix @xmath49 has view @xmath187 with arbitrary parameter @xmath83 and vector @xmath188 : @xmath189 .",
    "let us rewrite this expression in more compact form @xmath190",
    "it is known that any spinor has complete polarization axis .",
    "bispinor also has similar property : if @xmath191 is an arbitrary solution of dirac equation then there exists such vector @xmath192 that ( cp . with ) @xmath193    let us show this for solution of dirac equation with positive energy @xmath59 .",
    "write down equation in split form @xmath194 in the standard representation of the @xmath76-matrices we have @xmath195 where @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 is an arbitrary two - component spinor .",
    "substituting these formulas into we come to the problem of determination of complete polarization axis for two - dimensional spinor @xmath200 it is easy to check that vector appeared here @xmath201 has unit length @xmath202 if to recall that @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath197 .",
    "one can conclude that for solutions of dirac equation with positive energy the relation can be reduced to equation which has solution for any two - dimensional column ( cp . with ) .",
    "of course all the same holds for solutions with negative energy .",
