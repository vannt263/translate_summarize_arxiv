    "it is usually assumed that the lifetime of a resonance is given by its inverse total width @xmath1 .",
    "this assumption is widely used in the transport simulations of nuclear collisions in order to describe the decays of various baryonic and mesonic resonances .",
    "however , such a picture is not always correct .",
    "let us consider a resonance as the intermediate state of the two - body ( e.g. @xmath2 ) scattering .",
    "the lifetime of the resonance depends crucially on the relation between its width @xmath3 and the energy spread of the incoming particles @xmath4 @xcite : ( i ) for @xmath5 ( broad resonance ) the lifetime is given by the derivative of the phase shift with respect to the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy : @xmath6 which is the time delay in the transmission of the scattered wave in the case of scattering with only one partial wave @xcite .",
    "( ii ) in the opposite limit @xmath7 ( narrow resonance ) the averaging of eq.([taudel ] ) can be done over @xmath8 weighted with the cross section which leads to the average life time of @xmath1 @xcite .    in the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu )",
    "transport theory the colliding particles  by definition  have fixed energies and momenta .",
    "therefore , the _ correct _ lifetime of a resonance in buu is that of eq.([taudel ] ) ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "the life time of the @xmath9 resonance is given by eq.([taudel ] ) with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the phase shift of the @xmath12n scattering in the s=3/2 , i=3/2 channel .",
    "the two definitions of the lifetime , the _",
    "wrong _ one as @xmath1 and the _ correct _ one as the phase shift derivative , have a completely different dependence on the c.m . energy ( see fig . 1 and eqs .",
    "( [ taulife]),([gamma1 ] ) below ) : the inverse width decreases monotonically with @xmath8 while the phase shift derivative has a maximum near @xmath13 gev .",
    "especially , at threshold @xmath14 gev , the inverse width becomes infinitely large , while the phase shift derivative is zero . in view of the fact that most transport simulations use the wrong @xmath1 prescription",
    "it is interesting to find observable signals sensitive to the different lifetime prescriptions . in the present work  using the buu model  we study the influence of the @xmath0 resonance lifetime on the pion absorption on nuclei and on some pionic observables from heavy - ion collisions at 1 a gev . note that a quite thorough investigation of the analogous effects within buu in the fermi energy domain has been done by morawetz and coauthors .",
    "their works concern the nonlocal and quasiparticle corrections to the nucleon - nucleon scattering ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sect .",
    "ii , the modifications of the @xmath0 resonance absorption and rescattering probabilities in nuclear medium are discussed , the parameterizations of the @xmath0 width and lifetime for transport simulations are chosen . sect .",
    "iii contains numerical buu results .",
    "coclusions are given in sect .",
    "recently eq . ( [ taudel ] )",
    "has been generalized in ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of the decay of the @xmath0 resonance with multiple final channels , i.e. when the total width @xmath3 contains not only the @xmath15 contribution , but also the absorptional contributions like , e.g. @xmath16 .",
    "the result of ref .",
    "@xcite for the decay time of a uniform bunch of resonances which do not interact with each other ( see eq . ( 3.3 ) in @xcite ) rewritten here for simplicity in the nonrelativistic approximation is as follows @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the spectral function and @xmath19 with the total width @xmath20 . in the case of a resonance gas in vacuum ,",
    "i.e. when only the @xmath15 decay channel is open , eqs .",
    "( [ taudel ] ) and ( [ taulife ] ) are equivalent .",
    "this can be easily seen by introducing the phase shift ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 .    in transport simulations one deals with the partial lifetimes @xmath24 of resonances with respect to decay into different channels , including absorption and rescattering .",
    "if one uses e.g. @xmath25 as the lifetime for the @xmath0 with respect to the @xmath26 decay channel , this corresponds to the use of the `` standard '' cross section @xmath27 for the absorption channel .",
    "conversely , if the partial lifetime is changed then the cross section has to be changed accordingly .",
    "notice that the probabilities of the processes with the @xmath0 resonance in the _ final _ state , like e.g. @xmath28 and @xmath29 , are _ not _ modified .",
    "we now assume that the overall lifetime is given by eq .",
    "( [ taulife ] ) and define a modified total width @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 can be decomposed into modified partial widths @xmath32 : @xmath33 .",
    "there is one important aspect : the modified branching ratios , @xmath34 , have to be the same as the original ones , @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "this ensures that the measurable cross sections for multistep processes are correct . to see this we consider the process @xmath37 with a @xmath0 as an intermediate state . for the cross section one",
    "obtains @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the production cross section of the @xmath0 resonance in a nucleon - nucleon collision and @xmath40 is the outgoing branching ratio . keeping the branching ratios constant , both quantities , @xmath39 and @xmath41",
    "are not modified and hence the ( experimentally measurable ) cross section @xmath42 is not modified as well .    in the transport simulation the modified partial widths must be treated by the monte - carlo method in the same way as the usual partial widths . for the @xmath0 resonance , therefore , the probabilities of processes where the @xmath0 resonance is present in the _ initial _ state are _ all _ multiplied by the same factor @xmath43 to keep the branching ratios constant ( cf . also ref .",
    "@xcite for a different derivation ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the standard @xmath0 decay width in nuclear matter taking into account the pauli blocking for the final nucleon , @xmath27 is the usual differential cross section obtained directly as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the c.m .",
    "momenta of incoming and outgoing particles respectively , @xmath49 is the c.m .",
    "energy squared , @xmath50 is the spin - averaged matrix element squared given by the one - pion exchange model @xcite , and @xmath51 ( 1 ) if the final nucleons are identical ( different ) .",
    "analogous modifications have also to be done with the @xmath0 rescattering cross section ( [ sigmod1 ] ) and with the three - body absorption width ( [ gam3b ] ) , whenever the process @xmath52 is included in the buu theory .    before discussing buu results we will specify the explicit forms of the @xmath0 resonance width and lifetime .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite , that the total width of the @xmath0 resonance in nuclear matter is very close to the vacuum decay width .",
    "thus , we take @xmath53 where the parameterization from @xcite is used for @xmath54 , @xmath55 being the pion momentum in the rest frame of @xmath0 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 gev and @xmath58 gev . for simplicity",
    "we will also neglect the energy and momentum dependence of @xmath59 putting @xmath60 . in this case",

    "energy as given by the derivative of the phase shift ( solid line ) and by the inverse width ( dashed line ) .",
    "the shape of the function @xmath62 is basically dominated by the presence of the spectral function @xmath63 in eq.([taulife ] ) .",
    "this implies that resonances with mass near the pole mass @xmath64 have the longest lifetime .",
    "in the following we will address the question of whether the difference between the lifetime prescriptions could be visible in observable quantities .",

    "the resonance production / absorption quenching @xcite has been implemented in order to reproduce the experimentally measured pion multiplicity in central au+au collisions at 1 a gev .",
    "first , we have performed a buu calculation of the pion absorption on nuclei . to this aim",
    "we have selected the experimental data from ref .",
    "@xcite on reactions @xmath66 + c and @xmath66 + fe at the pion beam energies @xmath67 85 , 125 , 165 , 205 , 245 and 315 mev .",
    "2 shows the calculated excitation function of the @xmath66 absorption cross section in comparison with the data . the standard buu calculation ( dashed lines ) employing the @xmath0 lifetime @xmath1 underpredicts the data at the lower energies . using the lifetime of eq.([taulife ] )",
    "( dotted lines ) improves the agreement amplifying the absorption peak at @xmath68 mev .",
    "the peak corresponds to the beam energy @xmath69 mev at which the @xmath0 resonance is excited at the pole mass .",
    "however , the peak position is slightly changed by the fermi motion .",
    "the physical reason for the increased absorption with the lifetime of eq.([taulife ] ) lies in longer living @xmath0 resonances near the pole mass ( see fig .",
    "1 , solid line ) . this increases the probability that a @xmath0 will be absorbed in the collision with a nucleon . applying now eq.([taulife ] ) for the lifetime and , in addition , modifying the @xmath70 and @xmath71 cross sections according to eqs.([sigmod]),([sigmod1 ] ) results in the absorption cross section ( solid lines ) practically indistinguishable from the standard calculation , since the factor @xmath72 in eq.([sigmod ] ) is less than 1 near the pole mass of the @xmath0 .    the discrepancy between our calculations and the data at @xmath73 mev can be explained by missing the three - body absorption mechanism of the @xmath0 resonance : @xmath52 .",
    "we have performed the calculation including the three - body absorption as parameterized by oset and salcedo @xcite ( see dash - dotted lines in fig .",
    "2 ) . in this case",
    "we show only results with the lifetime of eq.([taulife ] ) and the modified absorption and rescattering probabilities in the processes @xmath70 , @xmath52 and @xmath71 ( eqs.([sigmod])-([gam3b ] ) ) , since these modifications , when done all simultaneously , have only a very small effect on the absorption cross section ( c.f . solid and dashed lines ) .",
    "we see now a good description at the lower energies , but at higher energies the data are overpredicted somewhat .    the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have observed an influence of the @xmath0 lifetime variations on the @xmath74 in - plane flow in central ni+ni collisions at 1.93 a gev .",
    "we have studied the @xmath66 in - plane flow for the system au+au at 1 a gev and b=6 fm .",
    "3 shows our calculations in comparison with the data from ref .",
    "the acceptance of the detector @xcite for @xmath66 s is good only at positive c.m .",
    "this causes the measured @xmath75-dependence to be asymmetric with respect to @xmath76 . at @xmath77",
    "all calculations generally agree with data within errorbars . however , there is a difference in the flow ( @xmath78 at @xmath76 ) between the calculations : the calculation with the modified lifetime ( [ taulife ] ) and the modified cross sections ( [ sigmod]),([sigmod1 ] ) produces less ( negative ) flow than the standard calculation , while the results with only modified lifetime ( [ taulife ] ) are practically the same within statistics with standard ones .",
    "indeed , @xmath66 s exhibit the antiflow due to the superposition of the shadowing and the coulomb repulsion from protons .",
    "smaller cross sections @xmath79 , @xmath80 near the @xmath0 pole mass give less shadowing and , therefore , less antiflow .    fig .",
    "4 shows the invariant mass spectrum of the correlated proton - pion pairs from the central collision au+au at 1.06 a gev in comparison with the data from ref .",
    "we have extracted the correlated pairs by selecting the proton and pion which are emitted from the same resonance and did not rescatter afterwards ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the comparison of this method with the background subtraction technique ) .",
    "the shape of the calculated spectrum well agrees with data , but the peak position is overpredicted by about 50 mev .",
    "we checked , that the peak position is not changed and the spectrum gets slightly wider when taking into account also those pairs , where the nucleon experienced rescattering on other nucleons one or two times .",
    "the calculations with the modified lifetime ( [ taulife ] ) ( dotted line ) and with modifying both lifetime and cross sections ( [ sigmod]),([sigmod1 ] ) ( solid line ) result in somewhat sharper peaks at the invariant mass of 1.2 gev .",
    "this is due to longer living @xmath0 resonances near the pole mass , which reach the late freeze - out stage and then decay to the proton - pion pairs .",
    "the @xmath0 resonances propagate now in an expanding nuclear matter and , therefore , their absorption is not so effective as in the pion - nucleus reactions .",
    "thus , increasing the lifetime of the @xmath0 resonances near the pole mass does not lead to their increased absorption , unlike the pion - nucleus case .",
    "we have performed a comparative study of the two choices of the @xmath0 resonance lifetime .",
    "using the inverse width is the standard one .",
    "however , this choice is physically _ wrong _ , since the resonances propagated in buu are not asymptotical plane waves , but intermediate states of the @xmath2 scattering .",
    "the _ correct _ choice of the resonance lifetime in buu is the derivative of the phase shift ( c.f .",
    "eq.([taudel ] ) or eq.([taulife ] ) ) , which is the delay time of the scattered wave .",
    "a consistent transport theory must include also the corresponding modifications of the @xmath0 resonance absorption and rescattering probabilities according to eqs.([sigmod])-([gam3b ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , we have found a quite weak sensitivity of the calculated pionic observables on the lifetime prescription , once the cross sections are modified accordingly , despite of the strong difference in the c.m .",
    "energy dependence of both lifetimes ( fig .",
    "1 ) . nevertheless , detailed comparison with more precise data on the pion flow and @xmath81 correlations is necessary to confirm the correct choice of the @xmath0 lifetime in nuclear matter .",
