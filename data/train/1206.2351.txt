    "the string theory landscape is a space of vacua in string theory , which hopefully includes the standard model in four dimension . despite of its importance",
    ", its progress is mainly in its statistical aspects @xcite ; and little is known about analytic structures of the space . by `` analytic structures '' we mean general interrelationship among distinct perturbative string - theory vacua",
    ". therefore , appearance of vacua in the landscape , relative stability / decay rate of vacua and identification of the true vacuum are included . in this short letter , by use of the non - perturbative completion , we demonstrate a prescription to extract analytic structures of the string theory landscapes from perturbative string theory .",

    "the over - all coefficient @xmath4 for each instanton is called d - instanton fugacity @xcite , which has no corresponding worldsheet observable .",
    "usually , we assume that the d - instanton action is positive : @xmath5 .",
    "however , a negative - action partner of the instanton , @xmath6 has also been observed @xcite in non - critical string theory @xcite .",
    "they are then generally defined as ghost d - branes ( or ghost d - instantons ) in ( non-)critical string theory @xcite .",
    "however , such a d - brane was not seriously taken into account , since it contradicts with perturbation theory .",
    "existence of the d - branes is discussed very recently mainly in resurgent analysis @xcite and it was found that these branes must be generally encoded in non - perturbatively completion of string theory .",
    "@xcite , and this is a main objection to identifying it as `` ghost d - branes '' .",
    "however we insist on using the terminology because , according to the free - fermion analysis @xcite , multi ghost - instanton sectors @xmath7 are simplify obtained by flipping the sign of the zz - brane boundary state operators in the multi - instanton sectors @xmath8 in all - order perturbation theory . ] in this letter , we shall see how these ghost d - instantons play a role in formulating `` analytic structures '' of the string theory landscape .",
    "since the actions of ghost d - instantons are negative ( their masses are negative ) , they are no longer `` corrections '' to perturbation theory ; they are rather _ indication of non - perturbative instability of the perturbative vacuum _ @xcite .",
    "however , this is a cause of confusions , because `` in principle , the ghost partner is defined for every d - brane , but it does not necessarily mean that the string theory is unstable . '' in fact , it is non - trivial to know _ which ghost d - instantons are allowed ( or not allowed ) to appear in the spectrum . _ naively , this information is given by physics of the d - instanton fugacity @xmath9 .",
    "however , it is subtle to directly deal with @xmath9 since they are coefficients of exponentially small corrections which are supposed to be negligible in asymptotic expansions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we should first grasp complete information of d - instanton fugacity . in the following",
    ", we shall see that , once one can control the information of d - instanton fugacity , one can quantitatively extract most of analytic aspects of the string theory landscapes , including _",
    "metastability , its decay rates _ and _ the true vacuum_.    _ the completion and fugacity _ it is known that perturbative amplitudes , including instanton corrections , in various solvable string theories are obtained by the information of spectral curves , especially with topological recursions @xcite . in particular ,",
    "all - order asymptotic expansion of eq .",
    "( [ asymexpwithinstantons ] ) is explicitly shown in @xcite , with fugacity remaining free parameters .",
    "then , for completion of the non - perturbative information in the asymptotic expansion , there are mainly studied two ways to control fugacity : one is resurgent analysis ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; and the other is isomonodromy analysis ( for mathematical developments on isomonodromy theory @xcite ; and with matrix models @xcite ) . the former is based on connection formula ( or stokes phenomena ) for analytic continuation of @xmath10 ; and the latter is based on _ stokes phenomena of the baker - akhiezer ( shortly ba ) functions on the spectral curves_. here we explore analytic aspects of the landscape from the latter approach .",
    "for a given spectral curve @xmath11 with a symplectic coordinate @xmath12 , we define the ba function as follows :    \\1 ) we define a function @xmath13 ( called string - background ) as @xmath14 where @xmath15 are branches of the algebraic equation , the number of which is an integer , @xmath16 . the function @xmath13 is a rational function on the curve and , without loss of generality , it may have poles at @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 in the following sense : @xmath20 with @xmath21 . here",

    "( [ expofstringbackground ] ) .",
    "schematically , we define it as a set of string - background @xmath13 : @xmath68 and the potential of the landscape is determined by the rh integral equation ( [ rhintegral ] ) .    note",
    "that the background independence of non - critical string theory was first explicitly shown in the topological recursions @xcite i.e.  within perturbation theory ; however for the potential picture of landscape we need to know the non - perturbative completion of the string theory . in the following , as a first non - trivial example for the analytic aspects of the landscape",

    "the corresponding conditions for the stokes matrices are known as the multi - cut boundary condition @xcite . in particular , in the case of @xmath69 minimal string theory , the constraint is the same as @xmath92-cut critical points of the multi - cut matrix models @xcite . cuts '' ( not one cut ) around @xmath93 in the resolvent function of this @xmath75 isomonodromy systems .",
    "it is because the spectral parameter @xmath94 creates @xmath92 copies of the physical cuts in @xmath81-symmetric way . ]",
    "a major difference from the previous cases @xcite is , however , that the poincar index is greater than the number of cuts : @xmath95 which greatly simplify the quantum integrable structure of the condition @xcite .",

    "[ dzgraph23]-a .",
    "note that the hermiticity condition , @xmath108 , requires that the free - energy is a real function .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that non - perturbative solutions of the matrix models should break hermiticity @xcite .",
    "this situation is recovered if one discards the hermiticity condition and insists that _ contours in the dz network attached to saddle points ( i.e.  d - instantons ) should be a single line with a uniform stokes multiplier _",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ dzgraph23]-b ) .",
    "we here refer to this condition as _ the single - line condition _ , which corresponds to the standard solutions from matrix models .",

    "this result suggests an important implications : ( anti - stokes ) lines of the dz networks correspond to `` the mean field path - integral of the many - eigenvalue system ( discussed in @xcite ) '' .",

    ", we conclude that the yang - lee edge perturbative string vacuum is unstable .",
    "more precisely , since there is no tachyon in its perturbative spectrum , this string theory vacuum is _ meta - stable_.    generally meta - stable vacua in quantum systems have an important characteristic by _ decay rate _ ..",
    "since minimal string theory is an euclidean theory with `` compact euclidian time '' , our decay rate is simply given by imaginary part of the free - energy of meta - stable vacuum .",

    "the way is to deform the path / network to avoid the instability ( now by discarding hermiticity condition with keeping the single - line condition as in fig .",
    "[ dzgraph25]-c ) : @xmath124 then its imaginary part is the _ decay rate _ of the yang - lee edge string vacuum ( @xmath125 ) : @xmath126}{\\sqrt{5\\pi ( 2\\sqrt{5})^{\\frac{3}{2 } } ( \\sqrt{5}-1)^{\\frac{5}{2 } } } \\mu^{\\frac{7}{8}}}+\\cdots . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is _ one half of _ the standard @xmath127 zz - brane contribution ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "generally one can see that the @xmath128 minimal string theory is meta - stable : the string theory with hermiticity has ghost @xmath129 zz - branes ( @xmath130 ) which render the vacuum unstable ; the decay rate is given by half of the @xmath127 zz - brane .",
    "string theory of pure - gravity , @xmath131 , is an exception , since there is no ghost zz - brane in its background and therefore it is a stable vacuum . in this way",
    ", we have shown that physics of the landscape is given by the networks / fugacity which control the spectrum of ( ghost ) d - instantons .",
    "importantly , this example shows that different networks ( fig .",
    "[ dzgraph25]-b1 and [ dzgraph25]-c ) , i.e.  different fugacities , may represent different physical situations of the same theory .",
    "since the yang - lee edge string theory is meta - stable , there is _ the true vacuum _",
    ", into which the string theory decays . for that purpose",
    ", we choose the spectral curve in the landscape , @xmath132 in such a way that there is large instantons along the deift - zhou network of the rh integral ( [ rhintegral ] ) .",
    "roughly speaking , the instanton actions on the saddle points @xmath133 ( @xmath134 = 0 $ ] ) should be positive real : @xmath135<0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the corresponding lines of the network @xmath37 ( with non - zero stokes multiplier @xmath136 ) are attached to the saddle point @xmath137 . in the current cases of @xmath96 ,",

    "this kind of condition has been discussed also in old literatures of matrix models @xcite .",
    "this simply means that the eigenvalues should fill up to the same fermi - level of the effective potential along the dz network .",
    "here we simply show the result : @xmath139 here the weierstrass @xmath140 function is given by @xmath141 the normalization of the system is now fixed as @xmath142 so that the corresponding string - background @xmath143 belongs to the landscape @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath144 is _ an coordinate of the string theory landscape _ of the yang - lee edge , and the true - vacuum condition is expressed with the weierstrass elliptic functions : @xmath145 \\alpha = \\frac{6 g_3}{7 }   \\zeta_w(\\omega_b)-\\frac{g_2 ^ 2 \\omega_b}{21},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath146 is the weierstrass half period along the @xmath147-cycle , and @xmath148 is the weierstrass @xmath47 function , @xmath149 .",

    "note that , since the expression includes elliptic functions , this vacuum represents non - perturbative vacuum whose classical dynamics would not be stringy degree of freedom although quantum corrections still resembles the closed - string behavior @xmath158",
    ". it would be worth drawing the string theory landscape with the parameter @xmath144 ( fig .  [ figlandscape ] ) .",
    "the pinched points correspond to perturbative - string vacua ( @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 ) in which the perturbative amplitudes have simple the power scale behavior .",
