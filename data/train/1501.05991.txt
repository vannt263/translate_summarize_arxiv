    "in this note , we are concerned with the polyhedral geometry of coxeter arrangements ( hyperplane arrangements associated to finite coxeter groups ) .",
    "coxeter groups are defined by certain presentations , but finite coxeter groups coincide with finite real reflection groups .",
    "the geometry , topology and combinatorics of coxeter arrangements have been extensively studied .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the regions of a real hyperplane arrangement are the connected components of the complement of the arrangement .",
    "previous work of the second author , with drton  @xcite and with swartz  @xcite , investigated certain projection volumes associated to a region of an arrangement .",
    "it was shown that the average volumes , over all regions , are given by the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the arrangement  @xcite .",
    "when all of the regions of the hyperplane arrangement are isometric , this result determines the precise projection volumes for each region .",
    "coxeter arrangements are a class of examples with the property that all regions of the arrangement are isometric . as further examples",
    "could not be found , the following question arose :    [ the q ] does there exist a real central hyperplane arrangement with all regions isometric that is not a coxeter arrangement ?",
    "the main result of this paper is a negative answer to the question in three dimensions .",
    "[ thm : main ] any real central hyperplane arrangement in @xmath1 in which all the regions are isometric is a coxeter arrangement .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] proceeds in several steps .",
    "first , we quote a result of shannon that allows us to restrict our attention to simplicial arrangements .",
    "next , we establish a sufficient ( and in fact necessary ) condition for a hyperplane arrangement to be a coxeter arrangement : all rank - two subarrangements are coxeter arrangements .",
    "this reduction holds true in any dimension . finally , instead of working with the decomposition of space into regions , we consider the induced decomposition of the unit sphere . in the three - dimensional case , this is a two - dimensional spherical triangulation .",
    "the hyperplanes in the arrangement become great circles on the sphere and the rank - two subarrangements become collections of great circles all containing a common pair of antipodal points on the sphere .",
    "we work explicitly with spherical geometry in order to prove that all these rank - two arrangements are dihedral .    in the final section we consider infinite affine arrangements in the plane .",
    "in this case , there exist arrangements which are not reflection arrangements but which nonetheless have all regions isometric .",
    "in this section , we briefly review relevant definitions , point out that arrangements with isometric regions are necessarily simplicial , and reduce the problem of identifying coxeter arrangements to a rank - two criterion .",
    "all of the results of this section apply to arbitrary rank .",
    "a _ finite real central hyperplane arrangement _ is a finite collection @xmath0 of linear hyperplanes ( i.e.  codimension-@xmath2 subspaces ) in @xmath3 .",
    "an arrangement @xmath0 in @xmath3 is called _ essential _ if the normal vectors to hyperplanes in @xmath0 span @xmath3 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath0 is essential if the intersection of its hyperplanes is the origin .",
    "a coxeter group is a group arising from a certain kind of presentation by generators and relations .",
    "informally , the relations say that the generators act like linear reflections , and indeed , a finite group is a coxeter group if and only if it has a representation as a ( euclidean ) reflection group  a group generated by euclidean reflections  in @xmath4 . given a specific representation of a coxeter group @xmath5 as a reflection group , certain elements of @xmath5 act as reflections .",
    "each reflection has a _ reflecting hyperplane _ or _ mirror_. the _ coxeter arrangement _ associated to @xmath5 is the collection of the reflecting hyperplanes for all reflections in @xmath5",
    ".    it will be more convenient for us to work with an equivalent characterization of coxeter arrangements as a _ closed system of mirrors_. that is , a coxeter arrangement is any hyperplane arrangement  @xmath0 with the property that for any @xmath6 , the ( euclidean ) reflection fixing @xmath7 acts as a permutation of @xmath0",
    ".    the _ regions _ of an arrangement @xmath0 are the connected components of @xmath8 .",
    "( some authors use the term `` region '' for the closures of these connected components , but the distinction is unimportant here . ) the regions of a finite real central arrangement are unbounded convex polyhedra .",
    "if the arrangement is essential , then the regions are pointed polyhedral cones .",
    "it is well known that the action of a coxeter group on the regions of the corresponding coxeter arrangement is simply transitive . here",
    ", we only need transitivity , which is easy to see because each hyperplane is a mirror . in particular ,",
    "all the regions of a coxeter arrangement are isometric .    in order to understand hyperplane arrangements",
    "in which all regions are isometric , we begin with an observation that allows us to only consider simplicial arrangements .",
    "an arrangement is _ simplicial _ if every region is the intersection of precisely @xmath9 open halfspaces .",
    "equivalently , each region is the positive linear span of @xmath9 linearly independent vectors .",
    "a simplicial arrangement is in particular essential .",
    "the following theorem is due to shannon  @xcite ; see also  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.1.5 ) .",
    "[ shannon]@xcite an essential arrangement @xmath10 of @xmath11 hyperplanes in @xmath3 has at least @xmath12 simplicial regions .    for our purposes ,",
    "this theorem is stronger than necessary . by the theorem , every essential arrangement has at least one simplicial region , so we have the following corollary .",
    "[ simp cor ] if @xmath0 is essential and all of the regions of @xmath0 are isometric , then @xmath0 is simplicial .",
    "[ nonessential ] in the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] , we restrict our attention to essential arrangements .",
    "we can do so because in dimensions @xmath2 and  @xmath13 , the answer to question  [ the q ] is obviously no , and this negative answer lifts easily to non - essential arrangements in @xmath14 . given a non - essential arrangement in @xmath14 , one takes the quotient of @xmath14 modulo the intersection @xmath15 of all hyperplanes in @xmath0 , and the quotient of each hyperplane in @xmath0 modulo @xmath15 to obtain a lower - dimensional arrangement . for example",
    "if @xmath15 is a line @xmath16 , then @xmath0 is a `` pencil '' of planes containing  @xmath16 , and the quotient is an arrangement of lines in a two - dimensional vector space .",
    "the quotient arrangements is necessarily a coxeter arrangement , and thus the original nonessential arrangement is also .",
    "corollary  [ simp cor ] and remark  [ nonessential ] let us restrict our attention to simplicial arrangements with isometric regions .",
    "the following lemma gives us an easier criterion to check in order to conclude that an arrangement is a coxeter arrangement , namely that codimension-@xmath13 suffices .",
    "the converse is easy , but we do not need it .",
    "let @xmath0 be a hyperplane arrangement in @xmath4 .",
    "rank - two subarrangement _ of @xmath0 is a subset @xmath17 of @xmath0 such that ( i ) there exists a codimension-@xmath13 subspace @xmath18 of @xmath3 such that @xmath17 is the set of all hyperplanes in @xmath0 containing @xmath18 , and ( ii ) @xmath17 has at least two hyperplanes .",
    "[ reduction ] let @xmath0 be a finite central hyperplane arrangement in @xmath3 . if every rank - two subarrangement @xmath17 of @xmath0 is a coxeter arrangement then @xmath0 is a coxeter arrangement .",
    "let @xmath0 be as above and assume every rank - two subarrangement is a coxeter arrangement .",
    "we need to show that @xmath0 is a closed system of mirrors .",
    "that is , given hyperplanes @xmath19 and @xmath20 in  @xmath0 , writing @xmath21 for the the euclidean reflection fixing @xmath19 , we must show that the image of @xmath20 under  @xmath21 is also in @xmath0 .",
    "but @xmath19 and @xmath20 intersect in a linear subspace @xmath18 of dimension @xmath22 , and the set of hyperplanes of @xmath0 containing @xmath18 is a rank - two subarrangement @xmath17 of @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath17 is a coxeter arrangement , @xmath23 is in @xmath17 and thus in @xmath0 as desired .",
    "in this section , we prove theorem  [ thm : main ] by rephrasing it as a statement in two - dimensional spherical geometry . that is , instead of working directly with a simplicial arrangement of hyperplanes in @xmath14 , we work with an arrangement of great circles on a sphere : each linear hyperplane intersects the unit sphere about the origin in a great circle .",
    "each region intersects the sphere in a spherical triangle .",
    "the hypothesis that all regions in the arrangement are isometric is equivalent to the hypothesis that all of these triangles are congruent . in light of lemma",
    "[ reduction ] , to prove theorem  [ thm : main ] , it is enough to show that every rank - two subarrangement is a coxeter arrangement . every rank - two subarrangement is the set of hyperplanes containing some line , corresponding to the set of all great circles containing some point ( or in fact two antipodal points ) .",
    "the hypothesis of lemma  [ reduction ] is equivalent to the statement that all of the angles at a given vertex are congruent .",
    "thus we can prove theorem  [ thm : main ] by establishing the following result .",
    "[ thm : main redux ] in any arrangement of great circles that cuts the sphere into congruent triangles , for any vertex , all angles incident to the vertex must be the same .",
    "our argument for theorem  [ thm : main redux ] uses some well - known facts about spherical geometry .",
    "first , consider a single spherical triangle with angles @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the area of the triangle is @xmath27 .",
    "the fact that area is positive gives us the inequality @xmath28 , which will be useful throughout the proof . also implicit throughout",
    "the proof is the fact that a spherical triangle has exactly as many distinct side lengths as it has distinct angles .",
    "this follows from the spherical law of sines : if @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the side - lengths opposite the angles @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 respectively , then @xmath35    next , we need an easy lemma about the possible sequences of angles around a given vertex .",
    "we state the lemma for spherical geometry , but it is not special to the sphere .    [ parity ] consider a triangulation of the sphere into isometric triangles with three distinct angles .",
    "then , when reading the angles around a vertex @xmath36 , if a maximal run of an angle has even length then the two angles bordering the run are the same .",
    "if a maximal run of an angle has odd length then the two angles bordering the run are different .",
    "[ lemma_parity ]    that is , if the angles are @xmath37 , a maximal run of @xmath33 s must be bordered by the other angles in one of the following four ways : @xmath38    assume that the maximal run consists of @xmath39 triangles with the angle @xmath25 and , without loss of generality , that the angle @xmath24 is before the run .",
    "figure  [ fig : parity ] shows the case @xmath40 .",
    "the first shared edge ( the edge between the first and second triangles ) has length @xmath31 .",
    "the next shared edge has length @xmath29 , and the shared edges alternate between @xmath29 and @xmath31 .",
    "the result follows .",
    "s following the angle @xmath32 must be followed by @xmath34.,height=144 ]    we are now ready to prove theorem  [ thm : main redux ] , which in turn proves the main theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "since all of the triangles defined by the arrangement of great circles are congruent , in particular , they have the same three angles .",
    "write @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 for these angles .",
    "we need to show that around any vertex , at most one angle can appear .",
    "we break up the argument based on the number of distinct angles appearing in @xmath41 .",
    "the first case is that the three angles are all distinct .",
    "consider the angles around a fixed vertex  @xmath36 .",
    "suppose all three angles appeared around @xmath36 .",
    "at a minimum we would have six triangles meeting at  @xmath36 with each angle appearing exactly twice .",
    "the sum of the angles around @xmath36 would then be at least @xmath42 .",
    "but then since @xmath43 , the sum around @xmath36 would be strictly larger than  @xmath44 , a contradiction .",
    "hence at most two distinct angles can appear around a fixed vertex .",
    "we now claim that at least one of the angles is a right angle . a well - known consequence of euler s formula  ( * ?",
    "* exercise  6.1.8 ) is that there must exist a vertex of degree less than or equal to  @xmath45 .",
    "since the triangles are defined by great circles , each vertex is incident with an even number of angles .",
    "hence there is a vertex incident with exactly four angles .",
    "opposite angles at that vertex are the same , and the parity lemma ( lemma  [ parity ] ) implies that all four angles are the same",
    ". therefore all four angles are right angles , and the claim is proved .",
    "suppose two angles , without loss of generality @xmath32 and @xmath33 , appear around a vertex @xmath36 . by the parity lemma ,",
    "each run of a fixed angle must be of even length .",
    "since opposite angles across the vertex are the same , the runs come in opposite pairs across the vertex . summing the angles around @xmath36",
    "thus yields @xmath46 for some positive integers @xmath47 and @xmath11 .",
    "thus @xmath48 . in particular ,",
    "neither @xmath32 nor @xmath33 is @xmath49 , so the claim says that @xmath50 .",
    "this yields the contradiction @xmath51 .",
    "hence we conclude that if all three angles of @xmath52 are distinct , then no two different angles can meet at the same vertex , and we have finished the first case .",
    "the second case is when two of the three angles are equal and distinct from the third .",
    "assume that the two distinct angles are @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath33 occurring twice and that the side opposite the angle  @xmath32 has length @xmath29 while each side opposite an angle @xmath33 has length @xmath30 .",
    "consider the angles at a vertex @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath36 is incident to an edge of length @xmath29 , then this edge is shared by two triangles , both having the angle @xmath33 at @xmath36 .",
    "conversely , every angle @xmath33 at @xmath36 includes a side of length @xmath29 .",
    "thus if @xmath36 has degree greater than @xmath53 , then the number of appearances of @xmath33 incident to  @xmath36 is twice the number of edges of length @xmath29 incident to @xmath36 .",
    "we conclude that if @xmath32 and @xmath33 are both incident to @xmath36 , then since opposite angles across @xmath36 are the same , there are at least @xmath13 appearances of  @xmath32 and @xmath53 appearances of @xmath33 . in particular @xmath54",
    "dividing by @xmath13 , we contradict the inequality @xmath55 .",
    "this contradiction finishes the second case .    in the third case , where @xmath56 , the conclusion of the theorem is immediate",
    "there are affine line arrangements ( with an infinite number of lines ) of the plane @xmath57 which have isometric regions but are not euclidean reflection arrangements .",
    "take the affine arrangement @xmath58 and apply a linear transformation , such that the image of a region is a triangle with at least two angles different , that is , not an equilateral triangle .",
    "the result is an arrangement where the angles around any vertex are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "observe that this agrees with the parity lemma , which holds in the affine case by the same proof .",

    "now apply the linear transformation @xmath65 where @xmath31 is a positive number different from  @xmath2 , that is , a scaling in the @xmath66 direction .",
    "the resulting arrangement cuts the plane into congruent @xmath67-triangles . since @xmath68 , the angles @xmath24 and @xmath25 differ .",
    "note that this is not a reflection arrangement since the triangle with vertices @xmath69 is not a reflection of the triangle @xmath70 .",
