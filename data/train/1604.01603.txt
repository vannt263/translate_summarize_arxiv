    "properties of these and other processes generalizing the concept of stationarity are described in the books by yaglom @xcite .",
    "the stationary and related stochastic sequences are widely used in econometrics and in financial time series analysis .",
    "examples of these sequences are autoregressive sequences ( ar ) , moving - average sequences ( ma ) , and autoregressive moving - average sequences ( arma ) .",

    "these models are properly described in the book by box , jenkins , and reinsel @xcite .",

    "traditional methods of finding solutions to extrapolation , interpolation , and filtering problems for stationary and related stochastic processes are developed under the basic assumption that the spectral densities of the considered stochastic processes are exactly known .",
    "however , in most practical situations , complete information on the spectral densities of the processes is not available .",
    "investigators can apply the traditional methods considering the estimated spectral densities instead of the true ones .",
    "however , as it was shown by vastola and poor @xcite with the help of some examples , this approach can result in significant increasing of the value of the error of estimate .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to derive estimates that are optimal for all densities from a certain class of spectral densities .",
    "these estimates are called minimax - robust since they minimize the maximum of the mean - square errors for all spectral densities from a set of admissible spectral densities simultaneously .",
