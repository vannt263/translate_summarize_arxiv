    "the veritas observation of 1es 1218 + 304 shows that the observed energy spectrum is considerably hard given its redshift .",

    "@xcite recently suggested a possible explanation for the hardness of the vhe spectra of high redshift @xmath0-ray blazars . according to this model",
    ", tev blazars may contain a separate but very hard , slowly varying emission component beyond several hundred gev . in the presence of a low magnetic field , electrons in the extended kiloparsec scale jets of tev blazars may inverse - compton scatter ambient cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons to tev energies .",
    "given the required radiative cooling time scale of the process , this tev inverse - compton emission is predicted to be very slowly variable in a low b - field .    considering the time scale of the observed flux variability from 1es 1218 + 304 , we can constrain the size of the emission region , r , of the vhe photons to @xmath35  pc , where the @xmath36 is the relativistic doppler factor of the radiating region . for a resonable value of the doppler factor ( @xmath3790 ) , @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , we can rule out the cmb - inverse - compton model of emission in the kpc scale extended jets as the sole explanation for extreme hardness in the intrinsic spectra of tev blazars .",
