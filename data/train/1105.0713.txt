    "the stantard model ( sm ) of particles physics have been very successful on explaining with an impressive accuracy several experimental results .",
    "collider phenomenology support it in almost all the processes measured .",
    "nevertheless , the sm can not explain completely the neutrino phenomenology  @xcite , the dark matter content in the universe  @xcite , and recently it has a tension in the anomalous like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry published by the d@xmath4 experiment at fermilab  @xcite .",
    "all these discrepancies have opened a new window in order to build theories on top of the sm .",
    "theories such as grand unified theories , supersymmetric theories , etc . , could explain some experimental facts that , by itself , the sm can not .    the fact that the neutrino has zero mass in the sm is not consistent with the neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "this result can be easily explained by adding a neutrino mass term to the sm lagrangian . in order to write a mass term for neutrinos",
    ", it is needed to deal with the inclusion a right handed neutrino field @xmath5 , which is not considered in the sm .",
    "then , it would be possible to write the dirac and majorana masses , @xmath6 this extension to the sm has been considered to give some explanation to dark matter , barion asymmetry , inflation , neutrino mass and oscillations  @xcite .",
    "however , the theory described by eq .   breaks explicitly the @xmath0 global symmetry which underlay in the sm .",
    "the connection between the neutrino mass term and the higgs mechanism suggest an extended gauge group @xmath7 as a natural symmetry to extends the electroweak group .",
    "this gauge group contain an extra gauge coupling and a gauge boson which would be present in the already measured cross sections .",
    "several studies has been implemented in @xmath0 theories , including right handed fields  @xcite , supersymmetric theories with broken r - parity  @xcite , collider phenomenology  @xcite , etc .",
    ", and all of them have interesting features such as the breaking of the @xmath0 gauge group radiatively , or the possible signals that could be seen at lhc , among others .",
    "the parameters of a model take different values depending on the energy scales where they are measured , and its behavior is controlled by the renormalization group equations ( rge ) . and , it is important to consider the extra parameters of a model , because they could give some indications of new physics , but in order to give some predictions it is necessary to know its values at the energies tested nowadays . on the other hand ,",
    "it is important to know , by experimental facts , the initial conditions of these differential equations if it is pretended to give their values at some desired scale .",
    "the rge formalism has been used in the sm and it has showed that the desired unification is not achieved in it  @xcite , but in its minimal supersymmetric extension , so called mssm .",
    "the mssm is an attractive theory ; quadratic divergences and the hierarchy problem are absent ; the unification of the gauge couplings and the spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath8 is naturally achieved by the rge , and it also have a dark matter candidate , when the @xmath9parity is conserved . if @xmath3 is included @xmath9parity does not need to be imposed because the operators , @xmath10 included in the superpotential can not be written due to the violation of the @xmath0 symmetry and therefore this extension have naturally a dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will focus on a supersymmetric model which could , in principle , give an explanation to neutrino masses . in order to explain the extra terms in the lagrangian we gauge the fields under @xmath11 ; we are interested in low energy phenomenology thus we calculate and solve the renormalization group equations in order to get low energy values for the masses and couplings .    this article is organized as follow , in section [ model ] we write the extra superfields , and the transformation laws that they obey under the gauge group @xmath12 , we write also the additional superpotential , the soft breaking lagrangian and the corresponding khler potential for the superfields , the gauge lagrangian and the scalar potential for the extra higgses ; in section [ couplings ] we calculate the beta function for the gauge couplings and we present the solution for a unified scenario ; in section [ zbl ] we analyze the applicable constraints given by @xmath13 searches that could restrict our parameter space ; in section [ sparticles ] we present the beta functions for the mass parameters , yukawa couplings and the anomalous dimensions and we solve them for two scenarios ; in section [ vev ] we analyze the low energy behavior of vacuum expectation value of the sneutrino , and then , we present our conclusions .",
    "we present a model based in the supersymmetric extension of the gauge group @xmath12 .",
    "the matter superfields includes all of those of the mssm , and the right handed neutrino superfield , @xmath14 .",
    "the supersymmetric extension of eq .",
    "requires two extra higgses , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "then , under @xmath12 these superfields transform as , @xmath17    in order to describe the pieces of the model , we define the contributions that we are going to add to the mssm by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 will be the superpotential , the soft symmetry breaking lagrangian , and the khler potential .",
    "we start by defining the superpotential ; the most general superpotential that can be written is , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , are the yukawa matrices corresponding to the majorana and dirac s terms respectively .",
    "as we have pointed out in the introduction we do not need to impose @xmath9parity , @xmath3 avoid us to write the operators that provoke the instabilities of the proton and moreover we have naturally a dark matter candidate , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .    applying the general prescription for the soft supersymmetric breaking terms , we add the following terms to the lagrangian , @xmath23 where the tilde fields are the superpartners of the fields involved in the superpotential , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the gauginos of the theory .    for completeness",
    ", the additional khler potential is given by , @xmath28 and the gauge lagrangian is @xmath29 where @xmath30 in the wz gauge ; and @xmath31 , the dual is @xmath32 ; and @xmath27 is the superpartner of the @xmath33 gauge boson associated to @xmath3 gauge group .    finally , we need the scalar potential for the higgs fields which have the form , @xmath34 where @xmath35 for @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "in order to get low energy values of the model , we use the rge formalism to calculate the beta functions of masses , couplings and the anomalous dimension parameters .",
    "we are interested to find the low energy value of @xmath39 , therefore we calculate the beta function of it , and we will solve it by implying a unification at the gut scale . for a general superpotential and soft breaking terms , the @xmath40functions can be calculated by using the representations of the superfields  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we will use the notation : @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the renormalization scale , and @xmath44 is the reference scale .",
    "the one loop beta functions for the gauge coupling constants are given by , @xmath45 where @xmath46 corresponds to the embedding factors .",
    "the unification of the gauge couplings @xmath47 occurs when the values of all match into a common value , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the corresponding gauge coupling of the unifying group , @xmath50 . due to @xmath51",
    ", we need to normalize the generators in order to keep the relation @xmath52 at the unification scale .",
    "it is important to notice that one can calculate the @xmath46 factors regardless on our ignorance the actual group that will realize unification , provided it keeps family universality on gauge interactions .",
    "the embedding factors are , in general , rational numbers satisfying , @xmath53 where _ t _ is a generator of the subgroup @xmath54 normalized over a representation @xmath55 of @xmath50 , and @xmath56 is the same generator but normalized over the representations of @xmath54 embedded into @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "computing the embedding factors we have , @xmath57 where @xmath58 are those well known for standard path of unification .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath59 .",
    "the general solution for @xmath60 can be expressed in terms of @xmath61 , and the solution is  @xcite , @xmath62.\\ ] ]    it is left to calculate the @xmath63 constants , we use the general formulae for a supersymmetric theory  @xcite , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the quadratic casimir invariant of the @xmath50 group , and @xmath66 the dynkin index of the @xmath55 representation .",
    "therefore , these constants have the values , @xmath67    in order to solve the equation , we need to impose initial conditions ; we use for @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "however , we have none information about @xmath69 . for this purpose",
    ", we have supposed that all @xmath70 will unify at the @xmath71 scale , which corresponds to @xmath72 gev . with this consideration , its possible to plot the corresponding running provided by eq .  .",
    "with the solution showed in fig . 1 , we can calculate @xmath73 and , @xmath74 , which is consistent with previous findings in ref .",
    "@xcite .    susy model .",
    "in the running we have assumed that there is a unification of all the couplings at the gut scale . ]    now , we need to look back to some experimental results because the inclusion of @xmath33 lead to contributions to all experiments in which the @xmath75 gauge boson is participating .",
    "the net effect of extending the sm gauge group with a @xmath76 is that the theory will have , in general , an extra @xmath13 gauge boson .",
    "this gauge boson have to mix with the @xmath75 of the sm and its effects will appear in all the tested processes in which the @xmath75 is present .    in our case ,",
    "this two gauge bosons do not mix ; by taking a look to the khler potential we have , @xmath77^{\\dagger }   h_u + \\left [ d^2h_d\\right]^{\\dagger }   h_d \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left [ d^2 \\sigma_1\\right]^{\\dagger } \\sigma_1 + \\left [ d^2 \\sigma_2\\right]^{\\dagger }   \\sigma_2   + \\left [ d^2 \\tilde n\\right]^{\\dagger } \\tilde n ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 , and the gauge covariant derivatives are , @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 , and we have identified @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 and its respective @xmath0 hypercharges has been specified in eq .",
    "( 3 - 5 ) . we have included the sneutrino in the discussion because several authors  @xcite have shown that in some scenarios the sneutrino field could acquire a vacuum expectation value , and if it is so then it will contribute to the mass of the @xmath33 gauge boson .",
    "so in the most general case , when these fields acquire a vacuum expectation value the masses of the gauge fields will be , @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and from which we have no information about its scale ; the electroweak angle @xmath90 is introduced in order to rotate the fields into a eigenstate mass basis , @xmath91 ; this feature it is not needed for the @xmath0 sector because the sm - gauge fields are not gauged under @xmath3 and so , @xmath0 is already in mass eigenstate .",
    "high order operators could mix this two gauge bosons ; operators in the khler potential as @xmath92 where @xmath93 are order 1 coefficients . if @xmath94 then they will definitively provoke a mixing between @xmath95 , although they will contribute to the precision measurements , the mass of the sm gauge boson , the invisible decay of the @xmath75 , etc . , and they could be constrained strongly by all these tests .",
    "moreover , these operators are suppressed by a mass scale @xmath96 to the second power and its scale could be , in the best scenario , of the order of tev where the new physics would appear . due to the fact that we are not considering higher order operators , @xmath97 ,",
    "we can treat both gauge bosons as mass eigenstates , and the fact that using rge we could get a prediction for @xmath2 has a direct impact on the mass of the associated @xmath3 gauge boson .",
    "the constraint obtained for a @xmath0 gauge boson is writen as  @xcite , @xmath98 therefore , in our model is translated to , @xmath99 and within this value we are also in agreement with a recent analysis  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it also means that the @xmath100 , which in general would contain contributions for the @xmath101 scalars and the sneutrino , has to be of the order of a few tev , which is still sizable for the lhc .",
    "the lhc has started up and it will bring new data for the higgs searches and also for physics beyond the sm .",
    "supersymmetric particles are one of the most expected signatures that it could be detected in the near future . in order to know the masses of the sparticles at the lhc energies , we need to perform the rge analysis and solve them down to low energies .",
    "we start with the gauginos , their one loop @xmath40functions are given by , @xmath102 we already know the solution for each gauge coupling , so , we need to put the initial condition for , the unified gaugino mass , @xmath103 . to be consistent with the phenomenology at low energy , we impose the condition that the mass of the lightest gaugino should be bigger than 100 gev . to accomplish this restriction , we found that @xmath104 gev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaugino ] , we present the running for the gaugino masses with @xmath105 gev .",
    "the first remarkable fact is that the usual conception of the lsp has been modified . in the mssm scheme ,",
    "the @xmath26 is considered as the lightest component of the lsp , but in this approach , the lightest component is the corresponding @xmath0 gaugino . meaning that the contribution to the relic density has to be reconsidered again , because its interactions will contribute to the dark matter fraction in the universe .    on the other hand , in this solution we are producing gluinos of masses higher than 850 gev .",
    "this masses are still in agreement with the recent results presented by cms and atlas experiments at cern  @xcite .",
    "gev in order to reproduce low energy phenomenology . ]         in general , the @xmath40functions of the mass parameters and the yukawas are given by , @xmath106 where the @xmath107 are the anomalous dimension matrices associated with the superfields , and at one loop level can be computed using the relation , @xmath108.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the previous ingredients we are now able to calculate the @xmath40functions for the yukawas and the remaining masses .    for the yukawa s evolution , we made the usual approximations , @xmath109 and by making these approximations we are just assuming that the third family is the heaviest one and the main contributions to the running will come only from these families .",
    "the contributions to the yukawa s @xmath40functions are then expressed as , @xmath110 and for the dirac and mayorana yukawas , we calculated the complete @xmath40functions , @xmath111    it is already known that the breaking of the electroweak sector is due to the running of top yukawa and we would like to see if we could get the breaking of @xmath3 by the contribution of the running of all the yukawas . due to the fact that the yukawa couplings have a direct impact on the masses of the particles , we start from these experimental conditions and run them to high energies .",
    "we also can restrict them by imposing a unification or not ; the condition that we used is such as the gauge group @xmath12 would be embedded in some bigger group ( @xmath112 unification plus a unification of @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) , although we do nt know if this is at all possible yet .    by looking fig .",
    "4 , it is clear that even if all the yukawas begin in the same point at @xmath71 , @xmath115 increase faster than the others , that is expected to generate the electroweak breaking . particularly for @xmath113 and @xmath114 ,",
    "they actually do not increase , even if in some cases they do it slowly , they can not reach @xmath116 as we will see .",
    "even if this happens , we can not exclude the possible breaking of @xmath3 due to the renormalization group equations , because the @xmath40function for the masses receives contributions from all the other sparticles , and from the parameters of the soft breaking terms which could generate this phenomena .    in fig .",
    "4 , we are considering other two scenarios : _ a ) _ if we suppose that at energies beyond @xmath71 , the string theory is the theory which governs the physics , then we do not need to impose a specific unification to the yukawa s couplings , so there is none unification of the yukawas at high energies , _ b ) _ on the other hand , if a grand unification theory is the responsible of the unification of the gauge coupling , we need a group which could permits an embedding such that preserves the gell - mann@xmath117nishijima formulae @xmath118    in the simplest case , we could suppose that exist a group , @xmath119 such that @xmath120 .",
    "in this example , we have an scenario where @xmath121 unification is present at the gut scale .",
    "these other possibilities are plotted in fig .",
    "4 , for comparison .",
    "the @xmath122-parameters also run over the energy scales .",
    "we computed its @xmath40functions and they are given by , @xmath123 the @xmath124parameter is related directly with the phenomenology at low energies with the relation , @xmath125 where @xmath126 ; that means that @xmath122 should be fixed to give the correct mass of the @xmath127 gauge boson , @xmath128 gev  @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath129-parameter holds an analogous relation but relating the @xmath33 gauge boson , @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "although the relation is very simialar , it is more complicated to bound it because we have no knowledge of the physical mass , but rather only know that @xmath132 gev , from previous discussion .    for the parameters in the soft breaking term , we have made the following approximations for the matrices *",
    "h*@xmath133 , @xmath134 with these approximations , the contributions due to @xmath3 to the soft parameters are given by , @xmath135    and , for the extra parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 , the @xmath40functions become ,    @xmath138        to be consistent with the previous approximations , we introduce the following anzats for the mass matrices , @xmath139 @xmath140    @xmath40functions for the scalars are given by , @xmath141    in order to write the @xmath40function for the sfermions , we need to define , @xmath142 \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , the contributions to the sfermions are , @xmath143    and , for the new superfields , the @xmath144 functions are given by , @xmath145    we are choosing the msugra scheme for the running of the parameters ; for both scenarios we imposed the following conditions , @xmath146 we consider the large @xmath147 regime because it is the most common scenario",
    ". nevertheless , low @xmath147 have to be reanalyzed ; high order operators could help to reach levels above the lep bounds for the sm - like higgs as it is pointed out in ref  @xcite .    in fig 5",
    ", we present the running of the rge for all the masses of the model .",
    "we can see that the spontaneous breaking of @xmath3 can be generated in this supersymmetric model , but we also have the right handed neutrino acquiring a vacuum expectation value at higher energies which is due to the running of the yukawa s constants . singularly , the early breaking of @xmath3 , which should happened at large scale .    between the mssm and these scenarios",
    "there are no quite big differences in the masses of the sparticles . in this scenarios",
    "we are producing the masses of the sparticles around 50 gev higher than those from the mssm for the same initial conditions .",
    "interestingly , running of the yukawa parameters are not so different among them , but their implications in terms of the breaking of @xmath3 and @xmath148 are very different .",
    "the matter that the sneutrino mass turns to negative values has been pointed out by several authors  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the crossing point of its mass parameter is taking place at very high energies in both scenarios , and on top of that , the scale is close the gut scale .",
    "so , this feature deserves to be analyzed closely in order to know what will be the order of magnitude of @xmath149 at low energies .",
    "we also need to take care of the @xmath15 field because this field shares information with @xmath150 via the soft lagrangian and the @xmath151terms , therefore , @xmath152 will receive contributions from it and it could be perceptible at low energies .",
    "in order to compute the vacuum expectation values of @xmath150 and @xmath15 at low energies we need to compute the corresponding potential to the sneutrino and the @xmath15 fields together .",
    "the contributions are coming from the @xmath154 , @xmath155 terms and the soft breaking lagrangian , @xmath156 where we identified @xmath157 . now",
    "that we know the solution of the rges , we minimize the potential and we find its values at low energies .     vacuum expectation values .",
    "the plot is for the scenario where there is no @xmath121 unification . ]    by analyzing fig .",
    "6 , we can see that even if the sneutrino mass becomes negative so fast during the running , the vacuum expectation value does not increase so rapidly and we get a value of the order of 320 gev at the @xmath158 scale .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath159 also starts to have a vev different from zero at the same scale of the @xmath160 .",
    "their values are not too high such as we can generate the neutrino masses via two paths , the corresponding to the sneutrino or the corresponding to the @xmath15 field .",
    "this two paths will be discussed in a further analysis  @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable , though , that @xmath149 and @xmath152 are generated at such early stage and however , their values remain under control due to susy contributions .",
    "in this paper we have studied an extension of the mssm gauge group , @xmath161 . in order to tackle the neutrino oscillation phenomena",
    ", we have added the dirac and majorana mass terms into the lagrangian by adding an extra superfield corresponding to right handed neutrinos .",
    "the majorana mass term breaks explicitly the @xmath0 quantum numbers which are preserve in the sm at all orders in the perturbation theory . in order to have an explanation to this breaking",
    ", we implemented an analysis based on the rge .",
    "we also computed the associated gauge coupling to @xmath3 and by imposing the unification at the gut scale we have found its value at low energies , @xmath162 .",
    "the possible existence of this gauge group brings a new @xmath163type gauge boson , that might appear at low energy .",
    "we have bounded its mass , @xmath164 gev , by using the @xmath165 experiment performed by petra .",
    "running of the sparticles have been perfomed in the msugra scenario in the large @xmath147 regime .",
    "the conception that the @xmath8 provide the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) has been modified ; by looking at the running of the gaugino masses we could note that the @xmath3 gaugino is the lightest component of the lsp and it has to be taken into account in order to compute relic density .",
    "we have studied in two different schemes for the running of the mass parameters , the @xmath121 unification and the no-@xmath121 unification . in both cases",
    "the breaking of @xmath3 is reached as it was expected , but due to the different running of the yukawa s constants , the breaking of the electroweak sector and the @xmath3 occurs quite differently . in the scenarios studied here , it also happens that the sneutrino acquires a vacuum expectation value at very high energies , close to the gut scale .",
    "nevertheless , we realized that its running does not grows very rapidly , and its value at low energy remains in a sensitive scale ( @xmath166 gev ) ; we also calculate @xmath167 at low energies finding that it also remains in a sizable range ( @xmath168 gev ) .",
    "once we know the order of magnitudes that the parameters can reach in this theory , we can now calculate the corresponding neutrino masses and the contribution to the dark matter content in the universe due to the extra neutral sparticles .",

    "<S> gauging @xmath0 symmetry provides a simple realization of the seesaw mechanism in a naturally anomaly free extension to the mssm gauge group , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we discuss in here , it turns out that the simplest @xmath0 extension of the mssm may change some of the conceptions about the path for gauge unification as well as to affect the predicted spectrum of the supersymmetric particles at low energy . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the coupling @xmath2 ended up to be smallest of all of them and the lightest gaugino is the one related to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> rge also help to understand the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath3 and the vacuum expectation value of the sneutrino at low energies , which occurs in this type of models . </S>"
