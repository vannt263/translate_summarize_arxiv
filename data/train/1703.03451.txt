    "in his original work on path integrals , feynman  @xcite noted that recognizing known facts from different perspectives can lead to new and interesting insights .",
    "quantum mechanics in particular has been an important example of this observation , having schrdinger s differential equation and heisenberg s matrix algebra .",
    "while the two theories mathematical descriptions are seemingly distinct , dirac s transformation theory proved their equivalence . in 1948 , feynman  @xcite added a third important mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics based on some of dirac s observations about the role of the classical action in quantum mechanics .",
    "this third description is also known as feynman s path integral formalism and , in combination with feynman diagrams , proved to be fundamental for the development and study of quantum field theories ( qfts ) .",
    "unfortunately , the path integral is a very elusive object .",
    "in fact , only for quantum mechanics an analytically well - defined path integral construction is known . in most other cases ,",
    "the path integral can only be evaluated `` formally '' , e.g. , by means of a formal power series in the physical variables  @xcite .",
    "thus , giving rise to perturbation theoretical approaches to qft . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the path integral can be defined as a continuum limit of the discretized system  @xcite .",
    "wilson  @xcite further developed this idea for qfts since the path integral of a quantum mechanical system in discretized space - time is always well - defined .",
    "thus , wilson defined the path integral fully non - perturbatively on a space - time grid , going beyond perturbation theory . using a transformation to euclidean space - time ( wick rotation ) , this discretized path integral has been successfully applied to study physical systems computationally  @xcite and phase space path integrals mathematically  @xcite .",
    "non - discretized path integrals in euclidean space - time can be studied within the framework of classical pseudo - differential operators and their traces and determinants  @xcite .",
    "these traces and determinants are defined using @xmath2-regularization which also gives rise to the kontsevich - vishik trace  @xcite . incidentally ,",
    "hawing  @xcite had proposed studying the path integral with a curved space - time background in a @xmath2-regularized setting long before the kontsevich - vishik trace was developed . in his approach , hawking used a power series expansion of the action and regularized the quadratic term using the spectral @xmath2-function .",
    "furthermore , gibbons , hawking , and perry  @xcite studied convergence properties of the @xmath2-regularized one - loop approximation of the path integral .",
    "thus , the paper aims to shed light on the following questions .",
    "* is it possible to @xmath2-regularize the partition function and expectation values of observables in minkowski space - time ? * are the regularized partition functions and expectation values of observables independent of the choices made in the construction of the @xmath2-function ? * does the regularization contain the known special cases of well - defined path integrals ( e.g. , wick rotated or space - time discretized ) ?",
    "* is the construction physically `` meaningful '' ?    given the recent developments on @xmath2-functions of fourier integral operators  @xcite , we aim to consider a non - perturbative approach to @xmath2-regularization of path integrals .",
    "in particular , we want this new approach to contain all the special cases above , i.e. , discretizations , wick rotations , and spectral @xmath2-functions . in order to achieve this goal",
    ", the generalized kontsevich - vishik trace is the ideal candidate .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the kontsevich - vishik trace is the only trace on classical pseudo - differential operators ( which we obtain from wick rotating ) that restricts to the canonical trace ( which we obtain after discretization ) .",
    "hence , we will alter feynman s definition of the path integral to incorporate the generalized kontsevich - vishik trace .",
    "this ensures that the new definition of the path integral coincides with feynman s definition whenever feynman s path integral is well - defined .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "appendix  [ sec : kv ] contains a non - technical overview of fourier integral operator @xmath2-functions and the generalized kontsevich - vishik trace . in section  [ sec : feynman ] , we will use the results of appendix  [ sec : kv ] to show that path integrals are regularizable in this sense and obtain an altered definition of the path integral , partition function , and expectation values of observables .",
    "finally , we will consider a number of physical models in sections  [ sec : harmonic - oscillator]-[sec : spontaneous ] .",
    "first , we will give examples applying the proposed regularization to very simple models such as the harmonic oscillator , the topological oscillator , and free fermions in order to show how the regularization works in practice .",
    "in a second step , we will apply the method to non - trivial cases such as the massive schwinger model and a @xmath1 theory .",
    "in particular , we will show analytic computations as well as python implementations using symbolic arithmetic .",
    "the author would like to express his gratitude to dr .",
    "karl jansen and dr .",
    "erhard seiler for inspiring comments and conversations which helped to develop the work presented in this article .",
    "considering the schrdinger equation @xmath3 we obtain @xmath4 following feynman s approach  @xcite ( cf . `` some remarks on mathematical rigor '' in chapter 4 - 3  @xcite and  @xcite , as well ) , we will change the physics slightly and introduce a ( flat ) time torus of length @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 then , we can formally introduce the partition function @xmath7 and the expectation of an observable @xmath8 @xmath9 the actual expectation value @xmath10 in the quantum theory can be recovered using the thermal limit @xmath11 unfortunately , the @xmath12 are not of trace - class , in general .",

    "* does the regularization contain the known special cases of well - defined path integrals ( e.g. , wick rotated or space - time discretized ) ?",
    "space - time discretization replaces the operators by matrices .",
    "hence all traces are well - defined and the construction of the @xmath2-regularization coincides with the canonical trace on trace - class operators .",
    "similarly , wick rotations yield pseudo - differential operators and there it is known that the @xmath2-regularization used in this context is the unique extension of the canonical trace .",
    "* is the construction physically `` meaningful '' ?",
    "this question can be interpreted in different ways .",
    "on one hand , we may ask if the regularization can be interpreted physically . in this sense , choosing the same gauge for both numerator and denominator in the expectation value of observables is important .",
    "this means that we replace the time - evolution of our system by a holomorphic family of time - evolutions . in other words ,",
    "we consider a holomorphic family of physical systems and conjecture that the physical values of the system to be studied can be obtained by analytic continuation .    on the other hand , we need to ask whether or not the regularized theory is physically correct . by construction , we know that the regularized theory coincides with the physical theory if we have trace - class operators to begin with . in case",
