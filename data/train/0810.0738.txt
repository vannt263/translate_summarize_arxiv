    "<S> it emphasizes the crucial role of the frustration in stabilizing the vbss states for @xmath49 . indeed , </S>",

    "<S> also , although quantum fluctuations can play an important role , here we can nevertheless provide simple additional arguments supporting our mean - field phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the large spin gap ( estimated by ed of a 32-site cluster to be around 0.69 @xmath1 @xcite ) is expected to survive at least in the vicinity of half - filling . </S>",

    "<S> finally , we have checked that below @xmath88 , the vbss melts towards phase - separated @xmath5-rvb state in agreement with variational monte carlo simulations for @xmath61 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , examples where spatial frustration and superconductivity coexist are kos@xmath8o@xmath13 and liti@xmath8o@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> although electron correlations are usually associated to nodal pairing , recent experiments show the evidence for fully gapped superconductivity in both compounds  @xcite , so conventional phonon - mediated pairing has been advocated . </S>",
    "<S> however , our results indicate that , on a strongly frustrated lattice , electron correlations can also lead to gapful pairing and a modulated structure . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that , despite interesting similarities , the @xmath14-symmetric vbss states differ from the unidirectional @xmath89 ss found on the square lattice of ca@xmath6na@xmath7cuo@xmath8cl@xmath8  @xcite by the absence of spatial modulation in the local hole density .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the interplay between electron correlations and geometrical frustration can stabilize novel states of matter exhibiting microscopic coexistence of superconductivity and spin dimer - crystalline order . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the inhomogeneous superconductor of the frustrated shastry - sutherland lattice which is disconnected from the half - filled dimer ground state  @xcite , _ fermionic supersolids _ emerge naturally upon doping a parent mott insulator with spontaneous spin dimer order . </S>",
