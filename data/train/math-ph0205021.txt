    "exponentially harmonic maps were introduced by james eells and studied by j. eells and l. lemaire @xcite .",
    "these maps generalize usual harmonic maps @xcite in the following sense .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be two riemannian manifolds and @xmath5 , a smooth map .",
    "an exponentially harmonic map is then an extremal of the following functional : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the riemannian volume element and @xmath8 is the so called `` energy density '' of the map @xmath9 . in local coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the equation for exponentially harmonic maps , which derives from the variation of the functional ( [ functional ] ) , is    @xmath12      in the sequel we will study somme particular cases of ( [ variation of the functional ] ) even when @xmath15 is noncompact and ( [ functional ] ) unbounded . in this case ,",
    "equation ( [ variation of the functional ] ) is taken as the definition of what we call an exponentially harmonic map .",
    "following eells and lemaire , we will consider the energy - momentum tensor asociated to @xmath9 : @xmath24 which is conserved ( @xmath25 ) when @xmath9 is a solution of ( [ variation of the functional ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that some particular cases of ( [ variation of the functional ] ) were studied by mathematicians in the context of the theory of elliptic partial differential equations .",
    "gilbarg and trudinger @xcite quote , for example , the equation : @xmath26 deriving from the variational principle : @xmath27    lut us remark finally that , if we want to make some contact with physics , we have to modify ( [ functional ] ) as follows : @xmath28d\\mu(\\phi)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , if we interpret @xmath29 as a spin vector , looks like the hamiltonian for the continuum limit of a heisenberg model .",
    "when @xmath30 is small enough , the variational principle @xmath31 leads to equations which approximate those of the usual harmonic maps ( sigma models ) .",
    "the equations derived from @xmath32 can be obtained directly from ( [ variation of the functional ] ) via the shift @xmath33 .",
    "in order to get some feeling about the solutions of ( [ variation of the functional ] ) , we study here scalar exponentially harmonic maps on two - dimensional euclidean and minkowskian manifolds : @xmath34      let @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "then , equation ( [ variation of the functional ] ) becomes @xmath39 we are searching solutions of the following form : @xmath40 .",
    "we are thus led to the equations : @xmath41f_{xx}=-[1+(g_y)^2]g_{yy}=l\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 happens to be an arbitrary positive real constant .",
    "@xmath43 leads , of course , to trivial solutions @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath45 , let @xmath46 . this leads to the system : @xmath47 then ( [ system1eq2 ] ) gives @xmath48 let us derive ( [ solution1 du syteme1 ] ) with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "this gives ( with @xmath50=constant ) : @xmath51 the elimination of @xmath52 from ( [ solution1 du syteme1 ] ) and ( [ solution2 du syteme1 ] ) gives : @xmath53 ^ 4\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.+2[s_+(x;l;c)+s_-(x;l;c)]^2\\right\\rbrace -k\\\\ p & = & s_+(x;l;c)+s_-(x;l;c).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 .",
    "similary we get the solution @xmath55 .",
    "a solution of ( [ variation of the functional when e = r2 ] ) can thus be written , with the above notations as , @xmath56 ^ 4 \\right.\\\\ & & \\left.+2[s_+(x ;- l;c)+s_-(x ;- l;c)]^2\\right\\rbrace -k\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which leads to the solution we look for",
    ".    if we write @xmath57 , then we can represent @xmath58 in the following parametric form : @xmath59 it is also possible to solve ( [ variation of the functional when e = r2 ] ) by the so - called hodograph method @xcite .",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath62 , we get immediatly : @xmath63 we know that if @xmath64 then @xmath65 .",
    "thus , there exists a function @xmath66 such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "equation ( [ variation of the functional when e = r2 ] ) can be written @xmath69 or , using polar coordinates , @xmath70 : @xmath71 which can be solved by factorizing : @xmath72 .",
    "we have now to solve the two equations ( with an arbitrary constant @xmath73 ) : @xmath74 if we are interested in periodic solutions , we set @xmath75 thus ( [ 1.14 ] ) can be reduced to the normal form by the following functional change : @xmath76 equation ( [ 1.14 ] ) then becomes : @xmath77 this equation can be reduced to the whittaker equation @xcite . writting + @xmath78 ,",
    "then the function @xmath79 sastifies the whittaker equation : @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "this solution can be expressed in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function @xmath82 which leads to the solution of ( [ 1.14 ] ) written as @xmath83 if @xmath84 , this solution is regular at the origin .",
    "we know that @xmath85 .",
    "then , for @xmath86 , we get @xmath87 , which is a solution of ( [ 1.14 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless this trivial solution ( and related to the case @xmath88 ) leads to some problems because , if we set @xmath89 , then @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "the computations are similar to the preceding case .",
    "the equation ( [ variation of the functional ] ) leads to @xmath93 the solutions of the form @xmath94 can be written with a parametric representation : @xmath95",
    "let m be a friedmann - lema^ itre ( fl ) universe endowed with the following metric : @xmath96 we consider exponentially harmonic maps : @xmath97 which are , for physical reasons explained above , extremals of the functional @xmath32 .",
    "they satisfy a modified version of equation ( [ variation of the functional ] ) which is written in this case : @xmath98 if we restrict ourselves to @xmath99 .",
    "this gives : @xmath100 let us take , for example , @xmath101 i.e. , @xmath15 is euclidean fl - universe ( without cosmological constant ) and @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the present value of the hubble constant ( @xmath104 ) .",

    "+ ii ) when @xmath108 and @xmath30 small : @xmath109 which is not regular at @xmath110 .",
    "see figure1    when @xmath111 we recover the well - know theory of harmonic maps coupled with gravity studied by t. hirschmann , r. schimming @xcite , t. hughes , t. kato , j. marden @xcite and lemaire and a. j. vanderwinden @xcite .",
    "let us start now with the following action , describing a gravitational field coupled with an exponentially scalar field : @xmath112 @xmath113 is a constant , @xmath114 is the cosmological constant , @xmath115 is the lagrangian density for matter and @xmath116 is a scalar field defined on a @xmath117-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the variation of @xmath118 leads to einstein s equations : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the usual energy - momentum tensor for matter .",
    "the variation with respect to @xmath9 gives a field equation which is very similar to ( [ variation of the functional ] ) .",
    "let us assume that @xmath99 and let @xmath15 be a friedmann - lema^ itre universe .",
    "then the field equations can be written : @xmath121 let us consider some particular cases .",
    "@xmath122    let us define @xmath123 and let @xmath124 be the hubble constant .",
    "we check that + @xmath125 , then the equations above define a dynamical system : @xmath126 submitted to the constraint : @xmath127 let us derive ( [ 4.7 ] ) and , using ( [ 4.6 ] ) , let us compare the result with ( [ 4.5 ] ) .",
    "we see that the preceding equations are compatible .",
    "we are thus led to solve the following equation :    @xmath128    for very small values of @xmath30 , this becomes : @xmath129 this gives solutions : @xmath130 where @xmath131 are constants which the same sign , @xmath132 a positive constant and @xmath133 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "@xmath134 ( @xmath135 is a first integral when @xmath136 ) .",
    "the equation ( [ 4.7 ] ) allows to write @xmath137 .",
    "see figure 2    it is interesting to note here that the coupling of @xmath9 with the gravitational field can make @xmath9 regular at @xmath110 in this euclidean case , which was not the case in the uncoupled situation ( see section3 ) .",
    "let us return to the case where @xmath30 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "we define @xmath138 , equation ( [ 4.8 ] ) leads to @xmath139 which is a dynamical system with a fixed point @xmath140 .",
    "if we put @xmath141 we get : @xmath142 the hubble constant can be deduced from the numerical integration of this dynamical system . from ( [ 4.7 ] ) we get : @xmath143 ^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] around @xmath144 ( i.e. @xmath145 constant ) we can neglect terms of order greater or equal to @xmath146 . using ( [ 4.10 ] ) - ( [ 4.11 ] ) we have at first order : @xmath147 as @xmath141 , we have to suppose that ( for @xmath148 ) : @xmath149 when @xmath150 .",
    "let us derive ( [ 4.4 ] ) . using ( [ 4.2 ] ) and",
    "( [ 4.3 ] ) with @xmath151,we find the following equation : @xmath152 equation ( [ 4.12 ] ) can be solved numerically using the variable change : @xmath153 .",
    "then ( [ 4.12 ] ) becomes : @xmath154 making the substitution @xmath155 , ( [ 4.13 ] ) can be written as .",
    "@xmath156 \\frac{1}{(\\lambda+1)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] wich can be studied numerically .    using ( [ 4.4 ] ) , we can determine @xmath157 @xmath158 if @xmath111 , equation ( [ 4.12 ] ) leads to ( [ 4.9 ] ) with @xmath159 if we assume that @xmath160 .",
    "if @xmath161 , the case @xmath111 can be studied from : @xmath162 with the above notation this gives @xmath163 the case @xmath164 is obvious .",

    "we get : @xmath174 using ( [ 4.4 ] ) , we find : @xmath175    then , by ( [ 4.2 ] ) and using the preceding notation , we can write the the equation : @xmath176 which is nothing but ( [ 4.12 ] ) when @xmath177 and @xmath178 ; @xmath178 implies @xmath179 ( see ( [ 4.14 ] ) ) . using the conservation law @xmath180 and equation([4.4 ] ) , we find :    @xmath181    an example of numerical solutions is given in fig.3 , 4 and 5 .    in fig.3 , we can see the typical behaviour of a friedmann - lema^ itre universe whose expansion is driven by exponentially harmonic maps and matter or radiation .",
    "this evolution know three different ages : first , the universe behaves in the usual way under the presence of matter or radiation , then its characteristic deceleration stops and finally , when the exponentially harmonic map @xmath9 becomes too small , the expansion accelerates ( see eq.([4.14 ] ) ) .",
    "but this is also the typical bahaviour of a universe that is dominated eventually by a positive cosmological constant or something that acts like it , such as a potential related to a scalar field ( quintessence ) .",
    "nevertheless , the careful reader has already noticed that this particular behaviour is only due to the exponentially harmonic feature of the scalar field @xmath9 and its particular initial conditions @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "this proves again that these interesting features , suggested among others by the observations of type ia supernovae , arise naturally in the context of exponentially harmonic maps without requiring an adhoc mechanism of inflation .    in fig.4 , we have represented the evolution of the energy densities of matter , radiation and the scalar field coupled to it . in the very early ages of the universe , the dominant contribution to the total energy is due to @xmath9 .",
    "but the universe expands just as if there was only usual matter and radiation .",
    "as this expansion goes on , the energy density of the scalar field @xmath184 goes below the density of matter and radiation , making the expansion accelerating when the field @xmath9 become tiny ( see ( [ 4.14 ] ) ) .",
    "this would correspond to the well known _",
    "`` cosmic coincidence''_. note that we have chosen the arbitrary constants arising in the integration of eq.([divt0 ] ) in order to get this peculiar model of expansion .",
    "the present study is purely qualitative , more work is under way to construct a quantitative model that could be compared , for example , with those of quintessence .    in fig.5 , we have represented the evolution of the scalar field @xmath9 in order to satisfy eq.([4.17 ] ) both in the presence of matter ( @xmath177 ) and radiation ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "the main interest of the use of exponentially harmonic maps is the fact that the lagrangian ( [ 4.1 ] ) is a generalisation of bosonic string lagrangian ( with only a dilatonic field ) written in einstein frame @xcite . indeed , if @xmath186 , the lagrangian ( [ 4.1 ] ) tends to this bosonic string lagrangian , if @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is the small cosmological constant .",
    "but mathematically , this limit @xmath189 is highly problematic due to the fact that unlike usual harmonic maps , exponentially harmonic maps have no good invariance property under homothetic changes of the field , as it was shown in the introduction .",
