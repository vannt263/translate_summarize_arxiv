    "many t tauri stars are observed with a flat spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the near infrared ( e.g. beckwith et al . 1990 ) .",
    "this is in contradiction with the standard disk which is usually modeled as a flat blackbody . the flat spectrum in the near infrared hints to an additional hot dust component in the circumstellar region of young stars .",
    "several models have been proposed , e.g. a dusty halo ( e.g. miroshnichenko et al . 1999 ) or a dust shell beyond the outer edge of the disk ( e.g. gregorio - hetem & hetem 2002 ) .",
    "both models can fit observed seds .",
    "however , it is not clear how such a configuration of the circumstellar dust should form .",
    "we are dealing here with a different location of the hot dust component , namely the surface of the circumstellar disk .",
    "for the surface to become much hotter than the interior , it must be inclined with respect to the infalling stellar radiation , i.e. the disk must be flared .",
    "such a flaring can happen naturally when the disk is in hydrostatic equilibrium in @xmath0-direction with a temperature distribution that falls off more slowly than @xmath1 ( kenyon & hartmann 1987 ) .",
    "chiang & goldreich ( 1997 , hereafter cg ) developped an analytical two - layer model .",
    "their flared dust disk contains an optically thick isothermal mid - layer and a superheated surface layer .",
    "cg provide simple analytical expressions to calculate the seds which are indeed flat in the near infrared , and their model is used by many people to fit the seds of young stellar objects .",
    "our intention was to study the reliability of these analytical two - layer models .",
    "we developped a radiation transfer code for the upper disk part to calculate the parameters that determine the disk structure and temperature distribution self - consistently , and we compare our results with the cg model . note that we compare our results to the original analytical cg model .",
    "a comparison between an improved two - layer model with a radiation transfer model has recently been done by dullemond & natta ( 2003 ) .",
    "our disk consists of an optically thick ( @xmath2 ) mid - layer which is isothermal in @xmath0-direction .",
    "the mid - layer is sandwiched by two top - layers which are marginally optically thick at visual wavelengths but still optically thin at ir wavelengths , i.e. @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , the infalling stellar light is completely absorbed within the top - layer .",
    "the dust particles re - radiate the energy at ir wavelengths , so half the redistributed energy leaves the disk into space , and the other half penetrates the mid - layer and heats it . as a third distinct region we define the disk photosphere which encloses the uppermost part of the top - layer and whose location is defined by the parameter @xmath5 ( see sect.[atmosphere ] ) .",
    "further , we make the following assumptions : the disk is in hydrostatic equilibrium in @xmath0-direction , gas and dust are well mixed throughout the disk , and in the mid - layer gas ( g ) and dust ( d ) are in thermal equilibrium at the same temperature @xmath6 . the emission and absorption of the gas component of the disk",
    "is ignored .",
    "we restrict the discussion to passive disks , which means that the only heating source is the star which illuminates the disk surface .",
    "in addition , our ( gas ) disk extends down to the stellar surface with no inner hole .",
    "the existence of such a hole would lead to a puffed - up inner rim and self - shadowing effects of the disk ( see dullemond et al .",
    "2001 and dullemond 2002 ) .      for a razor - thin passive disk around a star with effective temperature @xmath7 and radius @xmath8 the monochromatic flux entering the disk perpendicular to the surface at distance @xmath9 from the star is @xmath10\\ ] ] where the star is assumed to emit a planck spectrum .",
    "this flux can be parametrized in terms of the solid angle @xmath11 under which the star is seen from a disk surface element at distance @xmath9 and the so - called grazing angle @xmath12 , i.e. the mean angle of incidence of the stellar flux @xmath13 the grazing angle of a razor - thin disk is therefore @xmath14\\ ] ] which for large distances reduces to the handy formula used by cg @xmath15 this relation also holds for a wedge - shaped disk as long as its opening angle is small .",
    "[ flare ]    in a flared disk the surface is curved and the grazing angle increases with distance from the star ( see the the solid lines in fig.[flare ] ) .",
    "therefore , the flared disk intercepts more stellar light and is heated more efficiently .",
    "the grazing angle of the flared disk is by the amount @xmath16 greater than for a flat disk ( fig.[flare ] ) , and the total grazing angle becomes simply @xmath17 this flaring term of the grazing angle , @xmath16 , can be computed from @xmath18 with this new grazing angle , which is a function of the location @xmath5 of the photosphere , we can calculate the flux penetrating the flared disk in @xmath0-direction .",
    "the photosphere encloses the uppermost part of the top - layer .",
    "its onset is described by the parameter @xmath5 , which is defined as the height @xmath0 above the mid - plane where the visual optical depth along the direction of the infalling stellar light , i.e. along the grazing angle , equals 1 .",
    "this leads to a vertical optical depth of @xmath19 since the disk is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath20 can be calculated @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the density in the mid - plane and @xmath23 is the scale height of the disk given by @xmath24 here , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the stellar mass and the mean molecular weight .    from equaling eqs.([tau_perp ] ) and ( [ tau2 ] ) @xmath5 can be determined , but it is a function of temperature and grazing angle .",
    "the downwards and upwards directed fluxes , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are in equilibrium throughout the passive disk .",
    "we can calculate these two fluxes explicitely at the boundary between the isothermal mid - layer and the top - layer .",
    "we assume that half the incident stellar flux is re - radiated into space and the other half penetrates the mid - layer , leading to @xmath29 the flux leaving the mid - layer in upward direction is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the isothermal temperature of the mid - layer , and we set @xmath32 with @xmath33 as the angle measured from the @xmath0-axis .",
    "the visual optical depth of the mid - layer in vertical direction can be written in the form @xmath34 with the visual optical depth at the inner edge , @xmath35 , and the exponent @xmath36 as free parameters .",
    "the temperature of the mid - layer , @xmath31 , follows from equaling eqs.([fup ] ) and ( [ fdown ] ) .",
    "this temperature is , however , a function of the grazing angle .",
    "we have now three important parameters , @xmath37 and @xmath31 , but none of them can be computed independently , instead they must be calculated iteratively .",
    "we have to specify the visual optical depth in the top - layer in @xmath0-direction , @xmath38 .",
    "it should be high enough so that first , the infalling stellar radiation is completely absorbed and second , the dust grains at the bottom of the top ",
    "layer reach a temperature close to that of the mid - layer in order to guarantee a smooth transition . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath39 must be small enough to allow the dust emission , which occurs at infrared wavelengths , to escape the top - layer .",
    "the radiation transfer equation of a plane - parallel slab , @xmath40 with the source function @xmath41 , the incident intensity @xmath42 and @xmath43 is split into up - streams , @xmath44 , that penetrate the top - layer from the mid - layer , and down - streams , @xmath45 , that cross the top - layer starting from the surface .",
    "the incident intensity is either the stellar radiation for downwards directed streams ( but only for angles @xmath33 under which the star can be seen , else it is zero ) , or the emission of the mid - layer , @xmath46 , for the upwards directed streams .",
    "with the help of the feautrier parameters @xmath47 the mean intensity @xmath48 becomes @xmath49 which is needed to calculate the source function and the emission of the grains .",
    "the source function itself determines the up- and down - streams of the intensity ; the radiation field calculation must therefore be iterated .",
    "finally , the temperature of the grains at each location in the top - layer follows from balancing their absorption from the surrounding radiation field , @xmath48 , and their emission at their equilibrium temperature , @xmath50 .",
    "since we want to compare our results with those of cg we took the same parameters as they did : for the star , @xmath51k , @xmath52l@xmath53 , @xmath54r@xmath53 , @xmath55m@xmath53 ; for the disk , @xmath56au , @xmath57au , @xmath58 ; for the dust grains , spheres of radius @xmath59 m with mass density @xmath60g@xmath61 and absorption efficiency @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "the latter implies an absorption coefficient @xmath66@xmath67 per gram of dust .",
    "scattering is absent and we use @xmath68 . the disk is seen face - on .",
    "we first compare our height @xmath5 of the photosphere ( fig.2 ) with the cg results .",
    "the ratio @xmath69 which determines @xmath70 can be written in terms of the scale height @xmath23 @xmath71 according to cg the ratio @xmath72 drops from 5 at 3au to 4 at 100au but they use @xmath73 throughout their calculations which leads to an extremely thick flared disk with @xmath74au@xmath75au .",
    "our calculations show , however , that @xmath72 drops from about 6 at @xmath76 to @xmath77 at the outer edge , and our disk stays much flatter at large distances . in a recent work chiang",
    "( 2001 ) corrected their old results for the disk thickness and their corrected photosphere almost agrees with our results .",
    "the temperature in the mid - layer , @xmath31 ( fig.3 ) , is not so different in the two models .",
    "our mid - layer is slightly hotter especially in the inner parts ( @xmath78au ) but comparable with cg for larger distances .",
    "our temperature calculations in the top - layer result in a temperature gradient between the very hot surface and the bottom of the top - layer . in fig.4",
    "we compare our temperature distribution with the cg surface temperature as well as with our and the cg mid - layer temperatures at two different distances .",
    "we can not reproduce the very hot surface temperature of cg , but on the bottom of the top - layer ( at @xmath79 ) the temperature approaches everywhere the value of the mid - layer ( see bottom panel of fig.3 ) .",
    "the differences in the disk and temperature structure between the cg model and our more detailed radiation transfer calculations lead of course also to differences in the sed ( fig.5 ) .",
    "the emission from the cg surface layer which is much hotter than our top - layer is shifted to shorter wavelengths .",
    "the emission of the cg mid - layer comes from a narrower wavelength region than in our model and is too low .",
    "the total sed of cg therefore deviates from our results especially in the long wavelength region ( @xmath80 m ) .",
    "a radiation ransfer model for the upper disk part of a flared disk is presented and the results are compared with the analytical two - layer model of cg .",
    "we show that the major parameters that determine the structure of the disk , @xmath81 , must be calculated iteratively .",
    "in addition we perform detailed radiation transfer calculations in the top - layer to find the temperature structure in the upper disk part . at the bottom of the top - layer",
    "the temperature agrees very good with the values of the mid - layer . the very hot surface temperature found by cg",
    "could not be reproduced , and our total sed deviates from the one of cg especially in the long wavelength regime . although the two - layer model gives handy formulae to calculate the sed of a flared dust disk , the results should only be used as a ` first guess ' for the structure and temperature distribution of the disk and radiation transfer calculations should be performed for a better characterization of the circumstellar dust disk .      1 beckwith , s.v.w . , sargent , a.i . , chini , r.s . & gsten , r. 1990 , aj 99 , 924 chiang , e.i . , & goldreich , p. 1997 , apj 490 , 368 chiang , e.i . , joung , m.k . , creech - eakman , m.j . ,",
