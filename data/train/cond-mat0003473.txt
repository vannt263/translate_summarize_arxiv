    "we mainly consider energy calculations on systems with filling factors @xmath7 and @xmath3 .",
    "these system are most suitably described by the chern - simons theory . in solid state physics",
    "this theory is mainly used in the fields of the fractional quantum hall effect and high temperature superconductivity .",
    "the applications of the chern - simons theory in the field of high - temperature superconductivity is based on a work of polyakov @xcite .",
    "since the discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect by tsui , strmer and gossard ( 1982 ) @xcite there were many attempts to explain this experimental observation .",
    "the current chern - simons type theories of this effect are mainly based on a work of jain ( 1989 ) @xcite . in his theory",
    "he mapped the wave functions of the integer quantum hall effect to wave functions of the fractional quantum hall effect . in the case of filling fraction @xmath0",
    "every electron gets two magnetic flux quantums through this mapping . by this transformation",
    "one gets new quasi - particles ( composite fermions ) which do not see any magnetic field in first approximation ( mean field ) .",
    "a field theoretical language for this scenario was first established by halperin , lee , read ( hlr ) ( 1992 ) @xcite as well as kalmeyer and zhang ( 1992 ) @xcite for the @xmath0 system .",
    "the interpretation of many experiments supports this composite fermion picture .",
    "we mention transport experiments with quantum ( anti- ) dots @xcite , and focusing experiments @xcite here .",
    "an overview of further experiments can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ hlr studied many physical quantities within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "most prominent among these is the effective mass of the composite fermions which they found to diverge at the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "recently , shankar and murthy @xcite proposed a new theory of the @xmath0 system .",
    "based upon a transformation of the chern - simons hamiltonian one achieves a separation of the magneto - plasmon oscillators from the total interaction of the system . after restricting the number of the magneto - plasmon oscillators to the number of electrons they got a finite quasi - particle mass which scales with the inverse of the strength of the coulomb repulsion . in this derivation",
    "they calculate a smaller number of self energy feynman graphs than in the rpa .",
    "just recently stern et al .",
    "@xcite calculated the self energy feynman graphs for the theory of shankar and murthy in rpa and got the same divergence of the effective mass as hlr . besides the theory of shankar and murthy there are other alternate formulations of the composite fermionic picture which are formulated entirely in the lowest landau level @xcite .",
    "+ in the following we will use mainly the chern - simons theory of hlr to calculate ground state energies of the @xmath0 and the @xmath3 system . to get composite fermions one has to transform the electronic wave function with a rather singular transformation . due to this transformation one",
    "gets a density - density interaction of the form @xmath8 for small wave vectors . because of this singular interaction the singular diagrams in leading order should be resummed .",
    "these diagrams are well known as the rpa in the jellium problem in @xmath9 . we have shown in an earlier publication @xcite that despite of resumming these singular diagrams one gets an ir - divergence in the canonical potential of the @xmath0 system in rpa due to the @xmath8 interaction .",
    "thereby we used the chern - simons path integral of hlr for the resummation of the diagrams .",
    "we obtained further that the coulomb part of the energy is finite and in good agreement with the coulomb energy of numerical simulations of interacting electrons in the lowest landau level by morf and dambrumenil @xcite as well as girlich @xcite .",
    "we have to mention that c. conti and t. chakraborty @xcite got an excellent agreement with the numerical results by calculating the coulomb energy with the help of the stls theory @xcite which is a generalisation of the rpa theory . in the following it",
    "is shown that we obtained an ir divergence of the magnetic energy in our earlier work because the normal ordering of the chern - simons hamiltonian was not properly taken into account in the path integral of hlr . in @xcite",
    "we correct this error with the help of an intermediate time technique in the path integral and a change of the coupling between the fermion fields and the bosonic fields .",
    "one can show that this path integral has a finite energy in the rpa .",
    "details of the analysis of the rpa for this path integral will be published elsewhere . in the case of the coulomb gas ,",
    "the hartree - fock graphs belong to the maximal divergent feynman graphs @xcite .",
    "this is no longer valid for the chern - simons theory .",
    "for this theory we will get a finite energy for the spin polarized @xmath0 system by calculating the energy of all feynman - graphs which belong either to the hartree - fock graphs or to the maximal divergent graphs ( for a given number of interaction vertices ) . with the help of this principle",
    "one gets a well - suited finite approximation of the magnetic energy .",
    "furthermore , we get the same coulomb energy as in @xcite . + in the second part of this work we will calculate the coulomb energy of the @xmath0 and the @xmath3 system including the spin degree of freedom .",
    "the @xmath3 system is of theoretical interest because it consists of one landau level filled with spin up and spin down electrons . like in the @xmath0 system",
    "the second landau level is half filled with electrons .",
    "so the @xmath10 system should have similar physical properties as the @xmath0 system . as a matter of fact",
    "this is not the case .",
    "eisenstein et al.@xcite were able to show with the help of tilted field experiments that the ground state of the @xmath3 system is spin unpolarized and incompressible .",
    "this is different to the ground state of the @xmath0 system , which is spin polarized and compressible .",
    "numerical simulations of the ground state of the @xmath0 and the @xmath3 system @xcite show that one gets a transition from a spin unpolarized ground state to a spin polarized ground state depending on the strength of the interaction between the electrons . for calculating this transition with perturbational methods",
    "we will construct a chern - simons theory of the @xmath4 systems where @xmath11 is an even number by transforming the coulomb interaction of the second landau level to the first landau level . by neglecting the lowest landau level",
    ", the @xmath3 system behaves like a @xmath0 system with an altered interaction potential . because of this we can calculate the coulomb part of the energy of the @xmath3 system within the rpa formalism of the @xmath0 system .",
    "it will be shown that one gets a transition from a spin polarized to a spin unpolarized ground state for the @xmath0 system as well as for the @xmath12 system depending on the interaction strength .",
    "this transition is in qualitative agreement with the numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will use the chern - simons theory of the @xmath4 systems to calculate the compressibility , the effective mass and the excitations . + as mentioned above we will treat the energy problem of the @xmath0 and the @xmath3 chern - simons system in rpa .",
    "the use of this approximation is motivated by the similarity of the interaction potentials of these two systems to the one of the @xmath13 jellium problem .",

    "until now it is not clear wether the rpa calculations of the ground state energy in chern - simons theories are in agreement with the experiments .",

    "numerical integration of the two terms in @xmath201 ( [ 30345 ] ) yields results for @xmath202 which are about a factor 3 smaller compared to the second term .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath0 system . when fixing @xmath203 in @xmath204 there is no impact on the proportion of the two terms .",
