    "in this paper the reaction   is studied using the opal detector at lep and the cross - section times branching ratio for the decay of  into hadrons , denoted as , is measured . in this reaction a quasi - real photon is radiated from one of the beam electrons and scatters off the other electron producing a  as shown in figure  [ fig : zeefeyn ] .",
    "this process was measured for the first time  @xcite with the opal detector .",
    "the observable final state , ( e)e , consists of the scattered electron , e , and a fermion pair ,  , from the  decay while the other electron , ( e ) , usually remains unobserved in the beam pipe due to the small momentum transfer squared , @xmath67 , of the quasi - real photon .    from the cross - section  the cross - section of the subprocess , denoted by ,",
    "is determined .",
    "this is the first measurement of the cross - section @xmath68 for values of @xmath69 equal to or greater than the z - mass .",
    "the process is the same as ordinary compton scattering with the outgoing real photon replaced by a virtual photon @xmath8 or a z.    the cross - section @xmath70 is given by the convolution of the cross - section @xmath71 with the photon flux @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 .    for z boson or @xmath8 production in compton scattering e@xmath75 e@xmath76  @xmath77 of real photons ( @xmath78 ) ,",
    "the cross - section depends on the mandelstam variables @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81  @xcite @xmath82 the variable @xmath83 is the invariant mass of the quark - anti - quark pair the  decays into and for @xmath84 the well known terms for ordinary compton scattering remain .",
    "a singularity at @xmath85 is introduced by the virtual electron propagator in figure  [ fig : zeefeyn](b ) as the typical transverse momentum scale of the scattered  bosons is small  @xcite . for incoming quasi - real photons ( @xmath86 ) in ep or  collisions , the dominant regulating effect for this divergence",
    "is not the electron mass , but small , non - zero , incoming photon masses squared @xmath87 . via the replacement @xcite @xmath88 in the denominator of equation  [ eq : xsec ] , both the photon mass and the electron mass",
    "are included in the propagator .    a simple equivalent photon approximation ( epa )  @xcite @xmath89 ,    \\label{eq : epa}\\ ] ] where the integration is performed over the small photon virtualities , leads to an effective on - shell incoming photon flux .",
    "this overestimates the cross - section by a factor of two  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath87 spectrum of the incoming photons either has to be retained fully or modified to describe the process properly .",
    "the modified epa , denoted by @xmath90 is given by  @xcite : @xmath91     \\label{eq : dge}\\ ] ] in any case , the results will be sensitive to the modelling of the @xmath87 spectrum . in this paper the theoretical expectations",
    "are represented by monte carlo event generators using different approaches for obtaining the @xmath87 spectrum of the incoming photons .",
    "these are compared with the experimental data .",
    "the comparisons include the distributions of the mandelstam variables @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 as well as other characteristic variables , like @xmath83 , and @xmath92 , the energy of the scattered electron .    after giving a description of the data used for this analysis and of the opal detector ,",
    "a signal definition is given .",
    "using kinematic invariants a part of the cross - section   is defined as signal .",
    "thereafter the selection of the signal events is described and the total cross section  within the signal definition is calculated . using the same selection differential cross - sections d  and d",
    "are determined using an unfolding technique .",
    "the analysis uses @xmath93 ( syst . )  pb@xmath94 of data collected during @xmath95 with the opal detector at lep at a centre of mass energy of @xmath96  gev .",
    "a detailed description of the opal detector may be found elsewhere  @xcite and only a short description is given here .",
    "the central detector consists of a system of tracking chambers providing charged particle tracking over 96% of the full solid angle inside a 0.435  t uniform magnetic field parallel to the beam axis .",
    "it is composed of a two - layer silicon microstrip vertex detector , a high precision drift chamber , a large volume jet chamber and a set of @xmath97 chambers measuring the track coordinates along the beam direction .",
    "a lead - glass electromagnetic ( em ) calorimeter located outside the magnet coil covers the full azimuthal range with excellent hermeticity in the polar angle range of @xmath98 for the barrel region and @xmath99 for the endcap region .",
    "the magnet return yoke is instrumented for hadron calorimetry and consists of barrel and endcap sections along with pole tip detectors that together cover the region @xmath100 .",
    "four layers of muon chambers cover the outside of the hadron calorimeter .",
    "electromagnetic calorimeters close to the beam axis complete the geometrical acceptance down to 24 mrad , except for the regions where a tungsten shield is designed to protect the detectors from synchrotron radiation .",
    "these calorimeters include the forward detectors ( fd ) which are lead - scintillator sandwich calorimeters and , at smaller angles , silicon tungsten calorimeters  @xcite located on both sides of the interaction point .",
    "the gap between the endcap em calorimeter and the fd is instrumented with an additional lead - scintillator electromagnetic calorimeter , called the gamma - catcher .",
    "the tile endcap  @xcite scintillator arrays are located at @xmath101 behind the pressure bell and in front of the endcap ecal .",
    "four layers of scintillating tiles  @xcite are installed at each end of the detector and cover the range of @xmath102 .",
    "the predominant signature of the signal process in the final state ( e)eqq is one electron , two hadronic jets from the  decay and large missing momentum in the direction of the beam pipe due to the escaping electron . the cross - section is peaked at low @xmath103 where the scattering angle of the signal electron is large , i.e.   in the backward direction , and its energy is small .",
    "furthermore , @xmath104 implies that the  is emitted close to the forward direction . as a consequence a huge part of the cross - section lies outside of the acceptance of the opal detector ; therefore the signal is defined within kinematic limits .",
    "the process  and its subprocess can also be measured at a future  linear collider  @xcite .",
    "there this process will be the dominant source of real z production .",
    "furthermore this subprocess can be observed in ep collisions  @xcite where the beam proton emits a bremsstrahlung photon .",
    "the relevant quantity for the e@xmath105 collision is @xmath106 , the centre of mass energy in the e@xmath105 rest - frame . in order to be able to compare the results of this analysis with the measurements of other experiments lorentz invariant quantities",
    "are used for the definition of the signal .",
    "this is in contrast to  @xcite where the signal was defined by the geometrical acceptance of the detector rather than by lorentz invariant quantities .",
    "consequently the results from the previous paper can not be compared directly with the ones presented here .",
    "the signal is defined by the two diagrams shown in figure  [ fig : zeefeyn ] within additional kinematic limits as detailed below .",
    "further processes like the ones shown in  figure  [ fig : othfeyn ] leading to an ( e)eqq final state are treated as background even if they satisfy our signal definition .",
    "the feynman diagrams for @xmath107-channel bhabha scattering with initial or final state radiation are identical to the  compton scattering diagrams . while the bhabha events with initial - state radiation of a virtual photon correspond to the @xmath108-channel  diagram , bhabha events with final state radiation are equivalent to the @xmath109-channel  events .",
    "the cross - section for bhabha scattering diverges for @xmath110 .",
    "this divergence is regulated by a finite @xmath111 of the radiated @xmath8 but it still causes the cross - section to be largely peaked at small @xmath112 .",
    "bhabha scattering with @xmath8 radiation may best be characterised by two energetic electrons ( small @xmath87 of the exchanged photon ) and a preferably low - momentum @xmath8 ( small @xmath111 ) in the   centre of mass system , leading to small @xmath113 . in the observable phase space of the e@xmath114e@xmath115 e@xmath114e@xmath116z@xmath117 process on the other hand ,",
    "the energies of the incoming photon ( @xmath87 ) and outgoing  ( @xmath111 ) are sizeable and their momenta prefer opposite directions , leading to large negative values of @xmath6 .",
    "we therefore require the absolute value of the kinematic invariant @xmath113 to be larger than @xmath118  gev@xmath119 to define our signal .",
    "the square of the four - momentum transfer of the quasi - real photon , @xmath120 , is required to be less than @xmath121  gev@xmath119 to ensure that the electron emitting the quasi - real photon stays within the beam - pipe . as @xmath120 is usually small",
    ", this requirement does not reduce the cross - section by much . in order for the @xmath90 from equation  [ eq : dge ] to provide correct results",
    "the virtuality of the quasi - real photon needs to be the smallest virtuality in the process .",
    "this is guaranteed by requiring @xmath122 of the electron in figure  [ fig : zeefeyn]b ) to be larger than @xmath121  gev@xmath119 , the cut value on @xmath120 .",
    "this cut mainly rejects events which would be very difficult to select because either the energy of the scattered electron is small or the scattering angle is very close to the beam direction .    in order to avoid the region of hadronic resonances with all its uncertainties in the simulation of the spectrum we require the square of the invariant mass of the , @xmath123 , to be greater than @xmath124  gev@xmath119 . the kinematic limits for the signal are summarised in table  [ tab : sig ] .",
    ".__cuts used for the definition of the signal _ _ [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the uncertainty in the efficiency due to the choice of a particular monte carlo event generator is estimated by comparing pythia and grc4f . for this comparison",
    "only events with the signal electron within the acceptance of the detector , defined by a cut on generator level on the angle of the electron are used . the relative difference in efficiency of the two different monte carlo generators after subtracting the statistical errors quadratically is taken as a systematic error .",
    "uncertainties affecting the residual background have been evaluated separately for each of the three main background classes remaining after all cuts .",
    "background - enriched samples are obtained by inverting or omitting one or two cuts , while the other cuts remain unchanged .",
    "the full difference between the number of events remaining in the data and the number of expected events from monte carlo is taken as a systematic uncertainty .",
    "for the background from four - fermion final states the cut on the fit probability is omitted and the cut on the electron isolation is inverted . after applying these cuts , a relative difference of @xmath125 between the data and monte carlo is observed .",
    "the background from tagged two - photon events is enriched by inverting the cut on the electron s angle and energy .",
    "the relative systematic error is @xmath126 . by omitting the cut on the angle of the missing momentum and inverting",
    "the electron isolation cut the multi - hadronic background is enriched , leading to a relative systematic uncertainty of @xmath127 .",
    "the numbers of background events after all cuts in the  region are @xmath128 from four fermion events , @xmath129 from multi - hadronic processes and @xmath130 events from tagged two - photon reactions . in the zee region",
    "the corresponding contributions are @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 events .",
    "additional background sources contribute with less than @xmath134 event for each mass region .",
    "this leads to a relative error on the cross - section of @xmath135 in the low mass region and @xmath136 in the high mass region , as quoted in table  [ tab : sys ] .",
    "in further studies contributions to the background not modelled in the monte carlo were investigated .",
    "using random beam - crossing events , the interactions between the beam particles and the gas inside the vacuum pipe were found to be negligible .    for the multi - hadronic background an additional systematic cross - check is applied by comparing the prediction of two different monte carlo generators .",
    "a good agreement between the pythia and yfs3ff monte carlo generators has been found within the statistical errors . consequently no additional systematic error has been assigned .",
    "the systematic errors for the differential cross - sections stem mainly from the imperfect detector simulation in the monte carlo and from the uncertainty in the unfolding matrix @xmath137 .",
    "the error assigned for the detector simulation is taken to be the same as for the total cross - section .",
    "a value of 9.4% is assigned .",
    "the unfolding matrix @xmath137 is calculated using both the grc4f and the pythia monte carlo sample and the relative difference between the two is taken as a systematic error . for the background the same errors as determined for the total cross - section are used .",
    "the errors for the three different background classes are taken into account in each bin of the event distributions .",
    "the efficiency @xmath138 is calculated in bins of the variable @xmath139 for the differential cross - sections d  and in bins of  and the variable @xmath139 for the differential cross - sections d. it has therefore much larger statistical errors than in the calculation of the total cross section . within the statistical errors",
    "no difference between the efficiencies determined from the grc4f and the pythia monte carlo samples has been observed . consequently no systematic error has been assigned .    due to the small statistics of the data sample",
    "the systematic error for the differential cross - sections is much smaller than the statistical one .",
    "the cross - section for the process  has been measured in a restricted phase space , defined by lorentz invariant variables , in two different regions of the mass of the hadronic system , corresponding to either a @xmath140 or a z@xmath141 in the final state . with the cut at @xmath83  = @xmath3",
    "gev the @xmath8 and the z@xmath142 are well separated . with an integrated luminosity of about @xmath143  pb@xmath94 , a total of @xmath144 candidate events have been observed , while @xmath145 background events and @xmath146 signal events are predicted , giving a total of @xmath147 events .",

    "a large part of this cross - section is not detectable within the detector as the scattering angle of the electron is in the very backward direction . for the calculation of the cross - sections",
    "the efficiencies predicted by the grc4f generator are used .",
