    "the motion of the ribosoms may be blocked by some buckling of the mrna or by other proteins that may attach on a specific region of the mrna strand if this region is empty .",
    "this feature is accounted for in the model by defining a zone that corresponds to this specific region in the tasep lattice , and can flip between open and closed states . as in the biological system , the blocking may occur only if the region is empty .",

    "the other species is then prevented to enter the bottleneck until the bottleneck - zone is empty .    in both examples ,",
    "if the parameters are such that the clearance zone stays closed for a long enough time , impeded particles tend to accumulate behind the zone .",
    "the flow when the zone opens again is then very similar to the relaxation of a step profile .",
    "we therefore believe that it is of interest to study a minimal version of this problem . for an infinite tasep with a step initial condition as detailed in subsection  [ subsection : defmodel ] ,",
    "we define the _ clearance zone _ @xmath52 as the set of sites @xmath9,@xmath53,  ,@xmath54 .",
    "the size @xmath54 of the clearance zone is the only parameter in the problem .",
    "such a clearance zone is represented on fig.[fig : scheme ] .",
    "it can be thought as being closed until the initial time @xmath39",
    ".      the first quantity of interest to us will be the probability that the clearance zone @xmath52 is empty , _",
    "i.e. _ that @xmath55 at some given time @xmath7 . we will also be interested in the number of particles to the right of @xmath52 when the clearance zone is empty .",

    "note that the sum defining @xmath59 starts with @xmath60 , _ i.e. _ one considers only the case of an empty zone after the passage of at least one particle through the clearance zone .",
    "there is actually a time interval starting at @xmath39 where @xmath52 is empty and no particle has gone through it . in the future we may want to change the time origin in order to eliminate this zeroth empty interval .",
    "we shall therefore consider an alternative definition of the initial time and define the @xmath61 and @xmath62 analogously to @xmath56 and @xmath59 , except that the initial time of the starred quantities will be taken at the end of the zeroth empty interval .",
    "the zeroth empty interval ends when particle @xmath9 enters the clearance zone by performing its first hop from site @xmath8 to site @xmath9 .",
    "the waiting time before the first hop is exponentially distributed , and the starred and non - starred quantities are related by @xmath63 for @xmath64 and similar functions to be defined later ( which will all verify @xmath65 , a condition for  ( [ eq : phiphist ] ) to hold ) .",
    "eq.([eq : phiphist ] ) may be inverted to give @xmath66 equivalently , the initial condition for the starred quantities is @xmath67    in some models the clearance zone is allowed to close when it is empty , so that histories where there exist empty intervals will have modified weights compared to what the model studied here would give .",
    "as a first step to account for it , we shall also be interested in the first time @xmath52 is empty ( not considering the zeroth one ) , though no closure will be considered in the present paper .",
    "we define @xmath68 as the probability that @xmath52 is empty at time @xmath7 , conditioned by the fact that @xmath7 belongs to the first time interval where @xmath52 is empty , and that @xmath17 particles have passed .",
    "we also define @xmath69 , the @xmath70 and @xmath71 in analogy with the @xmath72 quantities .",
    "we have @xmath73 , with the special case @xmath74 .",
    "finally we also define the @xmath75 , @xmath76 and their starred counterparts as the probabilities that @xmath52 becomes empty for the first time between @xmath7 and @xmath77 with @xmath17 particles passed .",
    "the clearance zone almost surely gets empty for the first time at some moment of time , which imposes @xmath78 eq.([eq : normfn ] ) is true when replacing @xmath79 by @xmath80 as well .",
    "a quantity similar to @xmath81 has been introduced in ref.@xcite and extended in ref.@xcite , in a model in continuous space , where particles are injected at the entrance of a one - dimensional channel and cross it with a constant velocity until they reach the exit . in their model",
    "clogging occurs if more than one particle is present at the same time in the channel , and the authors derive various exact formulas for reversible  @xcite or irreversible  @xcite clogging , including the probability that no clogging occurs until a given time in the irreversible case .",
    "adapting this simple markovian model to our case would give an exponential distribution for @xmath82 .",
    "the characterization of the @xmath72 and @xmath83 quantities will be the main goal of this paper .",
    "obviously the knowledge of a non - starred quantity is equivalent to the knowledge of its starred counterpart , so that we shall use the most convenient set of functions , depending on the situation .",
    "it is also readily noticed that the @xmath84 quantities are single - time correlation functions and are expected to be a lot easier to compute than the @xmath85 quantities , which depend on the whole history of the system .    in the following",
    "we present a combination of exact , approximate and numerical arguments that account for the main properties of the probabilities defined in this subsection .",
    "here we focus on the simplest case @xmath60 , where all the quantities of interest can be computed directly , for an arbitrary length @xmath54 of the clearance zone @xmath52 . in this section",
    "we shall show how to compute @xmath86 , while the expressions for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , that can be obtained analogously , will be given in  [ section : exprf1 ] . by definition of @xmath86 we track the events where @xmath89 and @xmath90 and",
    "calculate their associated probability . by definition of the starred quantities ,",
    "particle @xmath9 is on site @xmath9 at @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath60 and the motion of the second particle is not influenced by particles @xmath91 , we may restrict ourselves to a @xmath53-particle system with @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we define two remarkable times : the time when particle @xmath9 hops from @xmath9 to @xmath53 will be denoted @xmath94 and the time when particle @xmath53 hops from @xmath25 to @xmath8 ( if it does ) will be denoted @xmath95 . for the history to contribute to @xmath96 , we must obviously have @xmath97 .    we shall now compute the probabilities of the histories that will contribute to @xmath96 .",
    "we first consider the case @xmath98 .",
    "the probability to have a given value of @xmath94 and any value @xmath98 then reads @xmath99 . in that case particle",
    "@xmath53 is necessarily blocked on site @xmath8 until @xmath9 hops at time @xmath94 .",
    "after that , the events that contribute to @xmath96 are those where particle @xmath53 does not hop during an interval of length @xmath100 , with associated probability @xmath101 , while particle @xmath9 must have hopped for the @xmath102 time at time exactly @xmath7 , which occurs with probability @xmath103 .    in the second case @xmath104 , the probability to have a given value of @xmath94 and a value of @xmath95 such that @xmath104 is @xmath105 .",
    "particle  @xmath53 is then allowed to perform at most one hop between @xmath94 and @xmath7 , corresponding to a probability @xmath106 to perform respectively @xmath8 or @xmath9 hop .",
    "the sum of these two terms reads @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the upper incomplete gamma function and @xmath109 is euler s gamma function .    from eq.([eq :",
    "cfst1comb ] ) we see that @xmath86 decays as @xmath110 at large times . in a naive reasoning",
    "we could consider that the events contributing to the long time behaviour of @xmath86 are those where particle @xmath9 goes very slowly through the zone @xmath52 and particle @xmath53 does not enter the clearance zone .",
    "however the impediment of two particles would give a contribution @xmath111 .",
    "actually , the dominant contribution is given by events where particle @xmath9 blocks particle @xmath53 most of the time .",
    "this requires the blocking of only one particle , hence a probability  @xmath112 .",
    "this combinatorial method provides an intuitive way of computing @xmath86 .",
    "it however seems hard to extend to @xmath113 .",
    "this shall be done in the next subsection by using the exact expression of the propagator .      here",
    "we will see that an exact formula can be found for the @xmath56 on the basis of the exact expression for the propagator  ( [ eq : prop ] ) and on the result  ( [ eq : probxnhopm ] ) .    for determining @xmath56 for a given @xmath17 one only needs to consider the @xmath114 first particles .",

    "we get as an intermediate result @xmath118 = \\det a_{jl } \\big|_{j , l=1,\\ldots , n+1}\\ ] ] with @xmath119 the sum over @xmath0 only affects the first column and can be carried out , using  ( [ eq : sumfn ] ) once again .",
    "we finally get @xmath120 with @xmath121    the result  ( [ eq : endetfin])-([eq : ejl ] ) is exact , and can be checked to give eq.([eq : cfst1comb ] ) for @xmath60 .",
    "the first few @xmath56 are plotted in fig.[fig : enlow ] .",
    "the agreement with the numerics is excellent as expected .",
    "( [ eq : endetfin ] ) and ( [ eq : ejl ] ) give a compact exact solution to part of our problem .",
    "these expressions however involve @xmath122 determinants and are not very easy to manipulate .",
    "in particular , it is not clear how to find a compact expression for @xmath59 starting from ( [ eq : endetfin])-([eq : ejl ] ) .",
    "it was already mentioned that the @xmath68 are more complicated quantities than the @xmath56 because they depend on the whole history of the system . in principle",
    "exact expressions could be written by summing over intermediate variables . here",
    "we simply do it for @xmath124 to illustrate the idea .",
    "we also derive the asymptotics of @xmath123 at large times .    to compute @xmath123 we have to select events such that when the first particle exits @xmath52 the second already entered it .",
    "we denote @xmath94 as the moment when particle @xmath9 exits the clearance zone , and @xmath125 as the state just before the hop ( state at time @xmath126 ) .",
    "we have to enforce the following constraints on @xmath125 :    * particle @xmath9 is supposed to hop from @xmath54 to @xmath127 at time @xmath94 , therefore @xmath128 . *",
    "the clearance zone can not be empty after particle @xmath9 hops .",
    "we therefore need @xmath129 .",
    "* the clearance zone must be empty after particle @xmath53 leaves it , therefore particle @xmath130 can not enter it .",
    "consequently we must have @xmath131 at all times and in particular @xmath132 .    at time @xmath94 particle @xmath9 hops , with probability @xmath133 . between time @xmath94 and time @xmath7 the second particle is supposed to exit @xmath52 .",
    "following the same logic , at time @xmath7 the positions of the particles @xmath134 satisfy the following constraints :    * particle @xmath130 has not yet entered the clearance zone , @xmath135 .",
    "* particle @xmath53 has exited , @xmath136 , and particle @xmath9 is ahead of it @xmath137 .",
    "all these constraints can be expressed by the formula @xmath138 where we have integrated over all the possible times @xmath94 when particle @xmath9 exits .",
    "fig.[fig : f2 ] shows the agreement between the exact expression  ( [ eq : cf2det ] ) and numerical results .",
    "although this expression is complicated , its asymptotic behavior for large times may be extracted . in [ section : asymptf2 ] we show that at large times we have @xmath139 eq.([eq : cfdetasymp ] ) provides us with an equivalent of @xmath123 for long times .",
    "it can be shown that terms coming from sectors where one of @xmath94 and @xmath100 is finite are subdominant .",
    "this exponential part of the decay generalizes to higher @xmath17 values , as we expect @xmath68 to be a convolution of polynomial factors times simple exponentials , which combine to finally give an overall @xmath110 .",
    "the power law in front of the exponential seems harder to predict for general @xmath17 .    in the following subsection",
    "we try to find a more systematic , yet approximate method for computing the @xmath68 .      in this section , in order to calculate the @xmath68",
    ", we shall make an approximation that we expect to be all the more relevant as the zone @xmath52 gets larger .",
    "we first assume that the history of the system can be factorized as a product of histories over the intervals where @xmath52 is empty and where @xmath52 is occupied , and we assume that a step is reformed each time the clearance zone is empty .",

    "the first one reads @xmath142 equation  ( [ eq : exprff ] ) means that the system is in the first empty interval at time @xmath7 if it has been emptied at time @xmath94 for the first time and no particle entered until then , _",
    "i.e. _ the time @xmath143 at which the next particle will enter the clearance zone is larger than @xmath7 .",

    "it links the @xmath84 , the @xmath85 and the @xmath141 , @xmath144 eq.([eq : receff ] ) states that if @xmath52 is empty at time @xmath7 , either it is the first empty interval or the first empty interval started at some time @xmath94 and the zone @xmath52 has been occupied again since then .",
    "the @xmath141 can be eliminated by using the starred quantities and using ( [ eq : defpin ] ) . after these transformations , ( [ eq : exprff])-([eq : receff ] ) imply @xmath145 we already know an explicit expression ( [ eq : endetfin])-([eq : ejl ] ) for the @xmath56 .",

    "there is a negative feedback , that may come from the fact that when a particle does not hop for a long time , thus reducing the current , a denser region appears behind it which will create a current higher than expected afterwards .",

    "the curves for very low value of @xmath17 seem to get closer and closer to the gaussian limit corresponding to  ( [ eq : lognormal ] ) , but as @xmath17 grows the sequence of curves slightly overtakes the gaussian and seems to converge towards a different limit .",

    "a step was made towards computing even more complicated , history - dependent quantities such as the @xmath68 , defined as the probabilities that the clearance zone is in its first empty interval at time @xmath7 , with @xmath17 particles having exited it .",
    "while the @xmath60 case is special in that @xmath220 does not truly depend on the history , we presented an exact expression for @xmath123 in terms of the propagator . using this expression",

    "we have proposed an approximate recurrence relation linking the @xmath68 to the already known @xmath56 , that works quite well for large enough values of @xmath54 . finally , we measured the main characteristics of the @xmath68 and discussed their physical meaning .",
    "this work can be seen as a first step in the study of more complex systems involving a clearance zone switching between open and closed states , in which closing can occur only if the clearance zone is empty  @xcite . in this paper the clearance zone @xmath52",
    "does not affect the dynamics of the particles .",
    "it would seem natural to enable the closing of @xmath52 with some rate , as in the model of ref.@xcite .",
    "the closing of the clearance zone in some realizations of the system history would however modify the probabilities @xmath84 in a way quite difficult to compute exactly as it would once again involve the past history of each realization . in the case of an infinite closing rate",
