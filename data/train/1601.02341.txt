    "the main outcome of the relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) experiments is the creation of a deconfined medium of strongly interacting quarks and gluons , known as quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "since the hqs are mainly produced at the initial stage of heavy - ion collisions and the thermalization time of hqs are of the order of the lifetime of qgp therefore hqs are the suitable candidate to probe the qgp . due to the large mass of hq , it was expected from perturbative qcd , the nuclear suppression factor , @xmath0 would have been large , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath1 0.6 and 0.8 - 0.9 for charm and bottom quarks , respectively  @xcite and the elliptic flow ( measured as @xmath2 ) of heavy flavoured hadrons were expected to be smaller than the light hadrons  @xcite but the experimental data reveals the opposite trend , _",
    "i.e. _ smaller @xmath0 and large @xmath2  @xcite . therefore , to circumvent the contradictory observation , investigation for the evolution of hqs with the proper input and the accompanied energy - loss mechanism in the hot and dense qgp becomes essential .",
    "+ for the evolution of hqs in the medium , understanding about",
    "the energy - loss mechanisms of hqs becomes vital .",
    "there are mainly two mechanisms for the energy loss of hqs : the first one is the medium induced gluon radiation ( radiation energy loss ) and the other one is the quasielastic scattering with the background medium partons ( collisional energy loss ) .",
    "earlier it was thought that the medium induced gluon radiation is the dominant one but recent studies suggest that this process is suppressed by the large mass of heavy quark , dubbed as `` dead - cone effect ''  @xcite , thus the collisional energy loss is then considered to be responsible especially at lower energies eg . ,",
    "rhic energy  @xcite .",
    "however , at lhc energy the `` dead - cone effect '' is not so pronounced thus the radiational energy loss become commensurate again . in brief , the issue is not yet settled and one can only say that both mechanisms for the energy loss are equally important to understand the experimental data for both @xmath0 and @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "+ since the evolution of hqs in phase space can be envisaged as the motion of a nonequilibrated particle in an equilibrium medium therefore the motion of hqs can be thought as the random motion or the brownian motion in the heat bath of an equilibrated plasma because the mass of hq is much smaller than the temperature of the medium .",
    "thus the trajectories of hqs due to its random motion can be quantified by the langevin dynamics  @xcite , which , however , can also be studied by the fokker - plank equation  @xcite in the limit of soft scattering ( landau ) approximation .",
    "other approaches have also been employed to study the hqs dynamics at rhic and lhc energies , _ viz . _",
    "relativistic boltzmann transport approach  @xcite , where the boltzmann equation is solved numerically by discretizing the space into a 3-dimensional lattice and the collisional integral is modeled by the stochastic sampling of the collision probability . instead of a constant coupling , the running coupling and the improved scattering matrix  @xcite within perturbative qcd framework supplemented by hard thermal loop",
    "( htl ) scheme has been employed to improve upon the collision integral and thence the drag and diffusion coefficients can be refined further .",
    "since the emergence of hadronic phase is inevitable in rhic therefore some efforts have also been made to understand the evolution of heavy flavours in hadronic medium  @xcite , which deciphers to subtract the hadronic contribution from the data to separate the effect of qgp alone .",
    "recently  @xcite , authors have shown that even a weak coupling of heavy flavour hadrons to the hadronic medium can lead to a noticeable contribution to the total elliptic flow .",
    "the aforesaid discussions are limited to the weak coupling limit , thus some groups used the complementary setup of the gauge - gravity duality  @xcite to understand the heavy flavour dynamics at strong coupling limit in heavy ion collisions . in summary , after so many efforts , all models face some difficulties to describe both @xmath0 and @xmath2 of heavy mesons simultaneously .",
    "the ultimate aim of the studies on the the drag and diffusion coefficients is to determine the transverse and the azimuthal momentum distribution of hqs .",
    "the fluctuation of the momentum encoded in the diffusion coefficient can be understood in terms of the random forces acting on the heavy quarks , which is defined by the auto - correlation of the random forces  @xcite . on the other hand , the drag coefficient , in relaxation - time approximation ,",
    "is related to the kinetic equilibration rate of hqs in a thermal medium  @xcite .",
    "asymptotically the drag and diffusion coefficients are related by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) : @xmath3 ( non - relativistically the fdt relation is @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the momentum and drag coefficients , respectively .",
    "one of our aim in this article is to check the fdt theorem .",
    "nowadays it is expected that the rhic collisions at the initial stage may induce an anisotropy in the momentum space due to the asymptotic free expansion of the fireball in the beam direction compared to its transverse direction .",
    "thus the strongly interacting fluid created in rhic possesses momentum - space anisotropies in the local rest frame  @xcite for a short duration of time in the initial stage .",
    "since the heavy quarks too are produced in the initial stage of the collision therefore the momentum - space anisotropies may have important implications on heavy quark dynamics .",
    "this anisotropy subsequently induces the chromo - weibal instability  @xcite in the medium , which may significantly affect the hq drag and diffusion coefficients  @xcite and facilitates early equilibration of the medium .",
    "thus it is desirable to study the effect of momentum - space anisotropy on the drag and diffusion coefficients of hqs , which , in turn may have significant impact on the experimental observables , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath0 and @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "+ in this article we have thus explored the effect of momentum anisotropy on the drag and diffusion coefficients due to collisional energy loss only when a test charm quark evolves in a hot anisotropic qcd medium . in our calculation we employ the one - loop running coupling constant and the debye mass in the leading and next - to - leading order to see the effect of the regulator on the @xmath7-channel matrix element , which appears in the collision integral .",
    "our work is thus organized as follows : first , in subsection ii a we revisited the drag and diffusion coefficients arises due to collisional energy loss alone in an isotropic medium .",
    "here we closely follow the kinematics used by svetitsky  @xcite with the corrected matrix elements made in ref .",
    "we then move on to an anisotropic medium in subsection ii b , where it is found that for weak anisotropic limit ( @xmath8 ) , both coefficients can be decomposed into the dominant isotopic and the sub - leading anisotropic contributions .",
    "later we demonstrate our results for an isotropic medium in subsection iii a and understand the salient features of both coefficients as a function of momentum , temperature etc . and its connection with the microscopic properties of hqs evolution from the point of view of statistical mechanics . with these understanding in isotropic medium",
    ", we then explain the numerical results for anisotropic medium in subsection iii b. we have noticed that how the momentum anisotropy affects the coefficients and finally transpires to the equilibration rate .",
    "finally we conclude in section iv .",
    "since the thermalization of hqs is very slow compared to the light quarks and gluons therefore a description of the motion of non - equilibrated degrees of freedom in the background of equilibrated degrees of freedom is required .",
    "the appropriate framework is provided by the fokker - planck equation .",
    "therefore we start with the boltzmann transport equation describing a non - equilibrium statistical system as follows : @xmath9 for @xmath10 interaction the collisional integral appearing in the right hand side of above transport equation can be written as : @xmath11 , \\label{two}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the rate of collision which encodes the change of hq momentum from @xmath13 to @xmath14 and can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the phase space distribution of the bulk constituents , @xmath17 is the relative velocity between the two collision partners , @xmath18 represents the cross - section and @xmath19 is the statistical degeneracy of the particles in qcd medium .    using the soft - scattering landau approximation in the collision integral , the resulting fokker - planck equation ( [ one ] )",

    "the generic integral appeared for both the drag and diffusion coefficients for hq in a hot and isotropic medium of massless quarks and gluons is given by  @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the masses and degeneracy factors of heavy quarks , respectively ( here we use @xmath29 gev for charm quark ) and @xmath30 , the equilibrium distribution function of the massless quarks and gluons is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 sign is for quarks and gluons , respectively .",

    "recently it is envisaged that the partonic system generated in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions at the nascent stage may not be necessarily isotropic in the momentum space rather the medium exhibits a momentum anisotropy due to the rapid expansion in the longitudinal direction compared to the transverse directions  @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to study the transport coefficients related to drag and diffusion processes in such anisotropic medium .",
    "if the anisotropy is small then the anisotropic distribution is obtained by either stretching or squeezing the isotropic distribution along a certain direction , thereby preserving a cylindrical symmetry in momentum space . in particular , the anisotropic distribution relevant for relativistic heavy ion collision can be approximated by removing particles with the large momentum component along the direction of anisotropy , @xmath66 as  @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an arbitrary isotropic distribution function and @xmath69 is the anisotropic parameter and is generically defined as : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the components of momentum parallel and perpendicular to @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "there have been significant advancement in the dynamical models used to simulate plasma evolution having momentum - space anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "one of us have studied the effects of momentum anisotropy on the quarkonia states by the leading - anisotropic correction to the resummed gluon propagator  @xcite which subsequently affects the suppression of quarkonium production at rhic and lhc .",
    "recently we have investigated the effect of momentum anisotropy on one the transport coefficients , _ namely _ the electrical conductivity  @xcite .",
    "if the distribution function is nearly an ideal gas distribution and the anisotropy , @xmath69 is small then @xmath69 can be related to the shear viscosity of the medium via the one - dimensional bjorken expansion in the navier - stokes limit  @xcite : : @xmath74 for an expanding system , non - vanishing viscosity implies the finite relaxation time in the momentum space , hence an anisotropy of the particle momenta does appear inherently , _ for example _ for the ratio , @xmath75 in the range , 0.1 - 0.3 and @xmath76 , one finds @xmath69 tentatively as @xmath77 .",
    "+ as we have explained , hot qcd medium due to expansion and non zero viscosity , exhibits a local anisotropy in momentum space , therefore the quark distribution function in the anisotropic medium can be approximated for a baryonless medium ( @xmath78 ) : @xmath79 for weakly anisotropic systems ( @xmath80 ) , one can expand the distribution function and keep the leading term in @xmath69 only : @xmath81 where @xmath57 @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath66 @xmath82 @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 is the angle between @xmath57 and @xmath66",
    ".    therefore the drag and diffusion coefficients in a weakly anisotropic medium may be obtained by replacing the phase - space distribution in the anisotropic medium ( [ anisodist ] ) @xmath87 since @xmath88 has two part : isotropic and correction due to momentum anisotropy .",
    "the resulting expression for drag and diffusion has two parts .",
    "the isotropic part is similar to eq.([seven ] ) .",
    "the expression for anisotropic part is as follows : @xmath89 now using the definition of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , one can get the expression for @xmath92 as follows : @xmath93 putting this value in eq .",

    "dash - dotted curve represents the drag on heavy quark due to light quarks of the qgp medium and dotted curve shows the contribution of gluons .",
    "further solid curve is the sum of these two contributions .",
    "( b ) variation of diffusion coefficient of charm quark with respect to hq momentum .",
    "all other things are similar to ( a ) . ]",
    "gev , and ( b ) @xmath97 gev . ]",
    "first of all we would like to explore how the charm quarks are dragged by the partons while propagating in a hot and isotropic medium through its drag coefficient . to see the effects of intrinsic motion of test quark , we vary the momentum of charm quark from non - relativistic limit ( @xmath97 gev ) to relativistic limit ( @xmath13=5 gev ) in figure 1(a ) at some temperature , @xmath98 gev of the medium . during the evolution of heavy quarks in medium ,",
    "the charm quarks are dragged by both quarks and gluons , thus we calculate separately the contribution by quarks , gluons and their sum total , which are shown by the dash - dotted , dotted and solid curves , respectively . in our calculation of the matrix element in @xmath7-channel , we take the regulator , @xmath99 as the leading - order debye mass , @xmath100 , unlike a constant value used in other calculations . for the temperature dependence of the debye mass , we take the strong coupling ( @xmath101 ) from one - loop expression .",
    "we found that the drag coefficient decreases when the momentum of the charm quark increases .",
    "this observation agrees with common sense because the relative speed of the charm quark with respect to the medium increases with the increase its momentum and hence the drag coefficient decreases .",
    "the above observation can be understood from the point of view of statistical mechanics in the following way : the equilibration rate of hqs in phase space decreases with the increase in its momentum , hence the drag coefficient for hqs should decrease with its momentum because the drag coefficient is related linearly to the kinetic equilibration rate .",
    "this understanding will later be useful to understand the variation of diffusion coefficient with the momentum ( in fig .",
    "another observation of fig .",
    "1 ( a ) is that the momentum dependence of the drag coefficient are mostly emanated from the gluon scattering due to their abundance and the large contribution to the cross - section whereas the contribution by light quarks is meagre . on the other hand",
    "the momentum dependence of the diffusion coefficient is opposite , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath102 increases with the momentum ( shown in figure 1b ) because it is easy for hqs having larger momentum to diffuse in the system compared to hqs of lower momentum . from the point of view of statistical physics ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient is a measure of the equilibration time ( inverse of the equilibration rate ) thus the coefficient should be greater when the hq momentum becomes larger . like the drag coefficient , the gluons contribute substantially to the momentum dependence of diffusion coefficient compared to the meagre contribution by quarks .",
    "gev , and ( b ) @xmath97 gev as function of temperature ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "we have plotted both coefficients at two different values of matrix regulator ie . , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the debye mass . ]    in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we have studied how a relativistic charm quark is diffused or dragged while evolving in a static isotropic qcd medium when the temperature of the medium changes from lower to higher values .",
    "we found that the drag coefficient becomes small and increases with the temperature slowly whereas the diffusion coefficient increases with the temperature rapidly , so their separation ( @xmath107 increases with the temperature .",
    "this can be understood qualitatively : since the momentum is much higher than the temperature of the medium therefore the physical scale set here is the momentum of hq only .",
    "if the temperature of a thermal medium is increased then the constituents of the medium exert more and more random force on the test particle , thus the increase of temperature causes the motion of the test particle more random .",
    "since the diffusion is asymptotically related to the temperature of the medium , therefore the diffusion coefficient increase with the increase of the temperature .",
    "similar to fig .",
    "2a , in figure 2 b , we have explored how do the drag and diffusion coefficients depend on the temperature for a non - relativistic charm quark ( @xmath97 gev ) .",
    "since the relative speed of hq becomes small therefore the drag coefficient becomes large . by the same reasoning as in figure 2 a , the relevant scale set here is the temperature of the medium , _ not the momentum of the test hq_. thus both the equilibration rate and the random force exerted by the partons increase with the temperature for hqs having low momentum .",
    "hence both drag and diffusion coefficients increase with the temperature .",
    "the increase of diffusion coefficient with the temperature in both figures ( figure 2 a & b ) is understandable because the number of constituents faced by the test particle increases with temperature ( for massless case , @xmath108 ) and thus the random force exerted on hq by the constituents increases .",
    "as we mentioned earlier in figs 1 and 2 , we have taken the regulator in the @xmath7 channel matrix element by the debye mass in leading - order ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the debye mass in the leading - order is correct in the weak coupling regime when the coupling constant is very small @xmath110 .",
    "however when @xmath111 then higher order corrections also arise in the debye mass  @xcite .",
    "kajantie et al .",
    "@xcite computed these contributions of @xmath112 and @xmath113 from a three - dimensional effective field theory . here",
    "we wish to see the effect of the regulator on the drag and diffusion coefficients due to the corrections in the debye mass .",
    "thus , we have used two regulators : @xmath114 and @xmath115 , where the factor @xmath116 takes into account the next - to - leading order corrections , for relativistic ( @xmath13= 5 gev ) and non - relativistic ( @xmath13=0.001 gev ) in figures 3 a and b , respectively .",
    "we observed that the inclusion of higher order effects in the debye mass as the regulator decreases both drag and diffusion coefficients . to be specific , the changes in drag coefficient of non - relativistic hqs due to increase in the regulator are about @xmath117 while going from t=0.2 gev to t=0.6 gev whereas in relativistic regime the change in drag coefficient ( @xmath118 ) is almost independent to the change in temperature .",
    "further the change in the value of diffusion is about @xmath119 as one goes from lower to higher temperature at non - relativistic momentum but again the percentage of change in diffusion ( @xmath118 ) remains independent to the temperature at relativistic momentum @xmath120 gev .",
    "+    ) with respect to hq momentum @xmath13 at fixed value of qgp temperature @xmath98 gev .",
    "we have also plotted the product of hq energy ( @xmath121 ) and temperature ( @xmath103 ) by dash - dotted curve for comparison . ]    to check the validity of the fluctuation dissipation theorem ( fdt ) for a picture where the non - equilibrated degrees of freedom ( in this case it is heavy quarks ) evolves in the background of equilibrated degrees of freedom , we have studied the ratio of the diffusion to drag coefficient ( @xmath122 ) for dynamical hqs in isotropic medium at a temperature , t=0.2 gev ( in figure 4 ) . as we know that the ratio is asymptotically related to the temperature of the medium so we have also plotted the quantity @xmath123 in the same figure .",
    "we observed that the fdt is almost satisfied in the non - relativistic limit of hq momentum but is violated as the hq momentum becomes more and more relativistic .",
    "this observation seems more plausible because fdt is satisfied only if a non - equilibrated degrees of freedom evolves in an ideal heat bath and undergoes through linear damping  @xcite .",
    "our result is consistent with other calculations  @xcite , where the kln factorization is employed to model the pre - equilibrium momentum space gluon distribution  @xcite .    ,",
    "and @xmath124 ) at a medium temperature @xmath98 gev for ( a ) perpedicular ( @xmath125 ) , and ( b ) parallel ( @xmath126 ) case . ]    , and @xmath124 ) at a medium temperature @xmath98 gev for ( a ) perpedicular ( @xmath125 ) , and ( b ) parallel ( @xmath126 ) case . ]      as we discussed in the preamble that the system produced at the early stage of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions exhibits an anisotropy in the momentum space , thus we aim to explore the effect of anisotropy on the heavy quark evolution because heavy quarks are also produced at early stages of the collision .",
    "since the anisotropy introduces an angular dependence in the drag coefficient so we have calculated the coefficient for different values of anisotropy parameter for two cases : a ) when the partons move transverse to the direction of anisotropy ( @xmath125 ) in figure 5 a and b ) when the partons moves along the direction of anisotropy ( @xmath127 ) in figure 5 b. the immediate observation is that the drag coefficient always decreases with the anisotropy ( @xmath128 ) for both parallel and perpendicular alignment , which can be understood qualitatively : in the small anisotropic limit , the anisotropic distribution function for partons may be approximated as an isotropic distribution function by removing particles with a large momentum component along the direction of anisotropy , ( @xmath66 ) , which causes a reduction of the number of partons around a test heavy quark in a given phase - space point ( @xmath129 ) . as a result , while propagating in the medium , hq encountered less number of scatterings and hence the equilibration rate becomes smaller in anisotropic plasma , resulting a decrease in the drag coefficient .",
    "it can also be seen that if the temperature of the medium is increased then the ( negative ) correction due to anisotropy increases , as a result the coefficient decreases sharply for all values of hq momentum .",
    "another important observation is that the drag coefficient of hq in parallel alignment ( @xmath130 ) is always less than the perpendicular alignment ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that for parallel alignment the momentum of partons got effectively shifted towards higher momentum side ( @xmath132 ) thus a large chunk of higher momentum particles do not contribute to the scattering of partons with hq whereas for perpendicular alignment , the shift of partons to higher momentum side does not arise that much . similarly we can see from figs .",
    "6 ( a ) and ( b ) that the diffusion coefficient also decreases due to the momentum space anisotropy .",
    "further , like drag coefficient , diffusion coefficient of hq also becomes smaller in parallel alignment than the perpendicular alignment .    in conclusion",
    ", we have first revisited the propagation of charm quarks in a hot isotropic medium of quarks and gluons by its transport coefficients - drag and diffusion coefficients and then explore the dependencies of the coefficients on the charm quark momentum , the temperature of the medium and the regulator in the @xmath7-channel matrix element in the form of debye mass .",
    "we have understood the results through the connection of the coefficients with the equilibration rate from the statistical mechanics point of view . with these understanding from the isotropic medium we move on to a medium which exhibits a momentum anisotropy and calculated both drag and diffusion coefficients in an anisotropic medium .",
    "the important finding of our calculation is that both drag and diffusion coefficients of charm quarks get waned due to the momentum anisotropy , which may be created at the early stages of the relativistic collisions .",
    "moreover the anisotropy causes a direction dependent sizable modifications to both drag and diffusion , as a result the ( negative ) correction due to anisotropy , when the partons are moving parallel to the direction of anisotropy , is larger than when the partons are moving perpendicular to the direction of anisotropy .",
    "thus the study of drag and diffusion coefficients in anisotropic medium will open up further applications to the phenomenology of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",

    "<S> the propagation of heavy quarks ( hqs ) in a medium was quite often modeled by the fokker - plank ( fp ) equation . </S>",
    "<S> since the transport coefficients , related to drag and diffusion processes are the main ingredients in the fp equation , the evolution of hqs is thus effectively controlled by them . at the initial stage of the relativistic heavy ion collisions , </S>",
    "<S> asymptotic weak - coupling causes the free - streaming motions of partons in the beam direction and the expansion in transverse directions are almost frozen , hence an anisotropy in the momentum space sets in . </S>",
    "<S> since hqs are too produced in the same time therefore the study of the effect of momentum anisotropy on the drag and diffusion coefficients becomes advertently desirable . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we have thus studied the drag and diffusion of hqs in the anisotropic medium and found that the presence of the anisotropy reduces both drag and diffusion coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the anisotropy introduces an angular dependence to both the drag and diffusion coefficients , as a result both coefficients get inflated when the partons are moving transverse to the direction of anisotropy than parallel to the direction of anisotropy . </S>",
