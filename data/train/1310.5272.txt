    "we presented energies for the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 systems and assessed the accuracy of an effective one - dimensional hamiltonian parametrized by the effective one - dimensional coupling constant @xmath47 .",
    "we focused on states that can be reached experimentally by first preparing an effectively non - interacting system and by then adiabatically changing the @xmath0-wave scattering length through application of an external magnetic field .",
    "as has been shown in the literature  @xcite , the complete energy spectra of few - body systems are rather dense and exhibit avoided crossings ( if the states belong to the same subspace of the full hilbert space ) and sharp crossings ( if the states belong to different subspaces of the full hilbert space ) .",
    "we found , in agreement with what might be expected naively , that the validity regime of the effective one - dimensional treatment based on @xmath44 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq_ham1d ] ) ] is limited , for the molecular branch , to the regime where the one - dimensional even parity scattering length is larger than the harmonic oscillator length in the tight confinement direction .",
    "when the one - dimensional even parity scattering length is large compared to the harmonic oscillator length in the tight confinement direction , we found that the effective one - dimensional description can be improved if @xmath47 is replaced by @xmath88 , which explicitly accounts for trap corrections that arise from the fact that the aspect ratio @xmath2 is finite and not infinitely large .",
    "when the one - dimensional even parity scattering length is small compared to the harmonic oscillator length in the loose confinement direction , we found that the effective one - dimensional description can be improved if the leading - order energy dependence of @xmath88 is accounted for .",
    "the fact that the leading - order energy dependence of the effective - one - dimensional coupling constant can be derived from the waveguide hamiltonian ( i.e. , the hamiltonian with @xmath50 ) indicates that the physics in this regime is not unique to the trapped system but analogous to what has been found for waveguide geometries .",
    "moreover , our analysis suggests that the accuracy of the effective one - dimensional treatment of small fermi systems with an impurity can be assessed fairly accurately by looking at the @xmath13 system .",
    "lastly , we found that finite - range effects ( or equivalently , the energy - dependence of the three - dimensional scattering length @xmath1 ) are negligible for the conditions of the heidelberg experiment  @xcite .",
