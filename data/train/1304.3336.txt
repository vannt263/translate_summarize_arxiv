    "over the years , there have been significant theoretical and experimental efforts from condensed matter and materials physics communities to understand and identify the topological quantum phase transition ( tqpt ) as well as different topological phases of matter  @xcite .",
    "these topological phases can be characterized by various kinds of topological properties such as topological invariants , non - trivial topological protected edge / surface states and/or unusual elementary excitations in the bulk or surface .",
    "a more recent promising realization of topological phases of matter is the time reversal invariant ( tri ) topological insulators ( tis )  @xcite .",
    "the tis in two  @xcite or three  @xcite dimensions have a bulk energy band gap , like a conventional insulator ( ci ) , but have a conducting gapless edge or surface states protected by time reversal symmetry . according to kramer s theorem , the edge or surface states consisting of an odd number of massless dirac cones are robust against tri perturbations , while those states consisting of an even number of massless dirac cones are not protected .",
    "this even - odd effect is the key reason why tis are characterized by a @xmath2 topological invariant  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a uniaxial pressure in sb@xmath0se@xmath1 induced tqpt has been proposed theoretically  @xcite .",
    "but it is very hard to realize experimentally that is because of the layer structure of sb@xmath0se@xmath1 resulting a van der waals - type coupling between each quintuple layers ( qls ) .",
    "thus , both the theoretical and experimental studies of control parameters induced tqpt are still awaiting .    recently , bera _ et al . _",
    "@xcite observed a hydrostatic pressure induced transition in sb@xmath0se@xmath1 using raman spectroscopy and obtained a bulk energy band gap closing at the critical pressure value using the first - principles calculations .",
    "that work indicated this system undergoes a tqpt from a ci phase to a non - trivial ti one with reversal of parity of electronic bands passing through a metallic state at the transition point by tuning the pressure .",
    "however , the mechanism of the hydrostatic pressure induced tqpt observed by raman spectroscopy  @xcite remains unclear . from the viewpoint of the band structure calculations in a well - understood framework , to undergo such a tqpt , four criteria must be satisfied : ( i ) the bulk energy gap must be closed when the tqpt occurs ; that is , when the pressure reaches the critical value p@xmath3 , the bulk energy gap should vanish .",
    "( ii ) the conduction and valence bands cross , forming a band inversion  at the tri @xmath4 point in the brillouin zone ( bz ) at a pressure above p@xmath3 . (",
    "iii ) the @xmath2 topological invariant should have a different number in the two phases divided by the bulk energy gap closing point .",
    "( iv ) the gapless dirac - like topological surface states inside the bulk energy gap only exist in one phase , while the other one does not exist .",
    "it is important to note that the criterion ( iii ) , that the @xmath2 topological invariant changed , suffices to understand the nature of occurring a tqpt and it also implies the others criteria based on the context of band theory and the idea of the bulk - surface correspondence of the tis  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically study the hydrostatic pressure induced tqpt in sb@xmath0se@xmath1 motivated by aforementioned discussions of four fundamental criteria , as well as the mechanism for tqpt based on the first - principles calculations .",
    "our results show that when the pressure is increased to the critical value , the bulk energy gap is closed accompanied by the tqpt occurring .",
    "our results also predict that a band inversion  appears at the tri @xmath5 point in the bz at a pressure value above p@xmath3 , which is attributed to the pressure induced enhancement of the crystal field splitting , resulting in the crossing between conduction and valence bands .",
    "this mechanism of realizing tqpt is qualitatively the same as previous theoretical proposal by using the uniaxial pressure  @xcite . to quantitatively confirm the tqpt occurring at the critical pressure value ,",
    "we calculate the @xmath2 topological invariant in two phases separated by the bulk energy gap closing point and show that the low pressure phase has a trivial @xmath2 topological invariant number @xmath6 , while the high pressure phase has a non - trivial @xmath2 topological invariant number @xmath7 . according to the idea of the bulk - edge correspondence of the tis",
    ", we also calculate the surface spectral function and show that the dirac - like topological surface states inside the bulk energy gap only exist in the high pressure phase , a non - trivial strong ti phase .",
    "the experimental validation of our theoretical predictions should be readily achievable by both spectroscopy and transport measurements .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "the first - principles calculations implemented in the vasp code  @xcite , the plane wave basis method , and the ultrasoft pseudopotential method with generalized gradient approximation ( uspp - gga ) exchange correlation potential have been used . additionally , the spin - orbit coupling is also included through all over the calculations . a 500ev cutoff in the plane wave expansion and a @xmath12 monkhorst - pack @xmath4-grid",

    "the low pressure phase is a ci , while the high pressure phase is a non - trivial ti.,width=359,height=245 ]    sb@xmath0se@xmath1 is assumed to have a rhombohedral crystal structure  @xcite with space group @xmath14 , similar to that of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) .",
    "this system contains qls ordered in a se1-sb - se2-sb - se1 sequence along the @xmath15-axis , and the primitive translation vectors @xmath8 are : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , respectively , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are lattice constants in the hexagonal cell .",
    "the internal coordinates of atoms se1 , se2 , and sb are set to be at the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we optimized both the lattice constants and internal coordinates under the hydrostatic pressure ranged from @xmath24 gpa to @xmath25 gpa without considering the crystal structure phase transition  @xcite occurring .",
    "if the pressure increases to a much higher value , the crystal structure will change and the tis could become conductors or cis .",
    "the issue of the structure stability of sb@xmath0se@xmath1 will be left to be addressed in future studies .",
    "those optimized results are all shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) . at ambient pressure p@xmath26 gpa the optimized lattice constants for sb@xmath0se@xmath1 are consistent with previous results  @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) , we notice that the lattice constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 are shrunk with increasing pressure , as one expects intuitively . however , the internal coordinate of the sb atom increases with higher pressures , which seems to be counterintuitive .",
    "this feature can be understood from the binding energy consideration : the coupling is strong between two atomic layers within one ql , while the coupling between qls , which is predominately a van der waals - type interaction , is much weaker .",
    "consequently , the lattice coordinate of the sb atom increases to minimize the total energy .",
    "next , we turn to discuss the relationship between pressure and the bulk energy gap , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the calculated bulk energy gap for sb@xmath0se@xmath1 at ambient pressure is @xmath27 ev , which is in good agreement with previous experimental and computational results ( about @xmath28 ev )  @xcite . with increasing pressure ,",
    "the bulk energy gap is gradually reduced .",
    "eventually , the bulk energy gap is closed when the pressure reaches to the critical value p@xmath29 gpa .",
    "it is worth to point out that the calculated critical value p@xmath30 gpa using uspp - gga is a bit smaller than the experimental value of p@xmath31@xmath32 1.6@xmath332.5 gpa  @xcite , which difference originates mainly from the fact that lattice constants and bond lengthes optimized by the pseudopotential method deviate slightly from the experimental values .",
    "we also performed extensive calculations with various pseudopotentials and the main features of tqpt remain qualitatively unaltered . due to the fact that the spin - orbit coupling strength in sb@xmath0se@xmath1 is not strong enough to induce the band inversion at ambient pressure ,",
    "sb@xmath0se@xmath1 is maintained as a ci phase at pressures up to the p@xmath3 .",
    "if the pressure is increased beyond the p@xmath3 , the bulk energy gap will be reopened and the system returns to an insulating phase .",
    "the bulk energy gap can reach up to a maximal value @xmath34 ev with increasing pressure , which is much larger than the energy scale of room temperature .",
    "such a gap closing - reopening transition by tuning the pressure indicates that there is a phase transition occurring at the critical point p@xmath3 .",
    "se@xmath1 under pressures of p@xmath26 gpa ( a)-(b ) and p@xmath35 gpa ( c)-(d ) .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is taken into account in ( b ) and ( d ) .",

    ".parities @xmath36 at eight tri @xmath4 points for sb@xmath0se@xmath1 under different pressure values .",
    "the @xmath2 topological invariants are @xmath7 for a pressure value above p@xmath3 while the @xmath2 topological invariants are @xmath6 for a pressure value below p@xmath3 , which indicate a non - trivial strong ti and a ci , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now proceed to elaborate the mechanism of the pressure induced tqpt . it is known from the atomic physics that the spin - orbit coupling strength is proportional to @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is the atomic number ; @xmath39 for sb and @xmath40 for se ) . as we have shown above ,",
    "the spin - orbit coupling strength in sb@xmath0se@xmath1 is not strong enough to induce the band inversion at ambient pressure .",
    "therefore , the spin - orbit coupling is unable to induce the band inversion even under a high pressure value and it can not explain the raman experimental results  @xcite either . to explore the mechanism of tqpt , we start from the crystal field splitting without considering the spin - orbit coupling effect . according to the point - group symmetry , the @xmath41 orbital",
    "is split from the @xmath42 and @xmath43 orbitals and the latter of the two orbitals remains degenerate on the sb and se atoms .",
    "due to such splitting , the energy levels around the fermi energy forming the valence and the conduction bands exhibit a large energy gap .",
    "this gap is much larger than the energy scale of the spin - orbit coupling at ambient pressure ( comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "when the pressure is applied , the crystal structure will be squeezed . as a result ,",
    "the level splitting is enhanced and the bulk energy gap between the top of valence band and the bottom of conduction band at @xmath5 point is gradually reduced .",
    "if the pressure is increased enough , the valence band and the conduction band will cross to form a semi - metallic state , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](c ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](c ) , there are two accidental degenerate states appearing around the @xmath5 point , which are not protected by time reversal symmetry .",
    "thus , if we take the spin - orbit interaction into account , these accidental degenerate states will be broken and a non - trivial ti is realized ( see fig .",

    "se@xmath1 at ambient pressure ( a ) and the pressure value p@xmath35 gpa ( b ) on the @xmath44 $ ] surface .",
    "the red regions indicate bulk energy gaps while the green regions indicate bulk energy bands .",
    "the dirac - like topological surface states can only be seen clearly around the @xmath5 point under the pressure p@xmath35 gpa ( lower panel ) .",
    "the dashed line indicates the fermi level.,width=321,height=283 ]    to firmly confirm that the tqpt is induced by pressure , we further calculate the @xmath2 topological invariant . because of the existence of the spatial inversion symmetry in sb@xmath0se@xmath1 , the calculation of the @xmath2 topological invariant can be dramatically simplified by the so - called parity method  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath2 topological invariant of sb@xmath0se@xmath1 under pressure can be obtained from the wave function parities at the eight tri @xmath4 points defined as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 are primitive reciprocal lattice vectors with @xmath47 or @xmath48 , and determined by the quantities @xmath49 .",
    "here , @xmath50 is the eigenvalue of parity operator @xmath51 , which corresponds to even ( odd ) parity of the bloch functions @xmath52 at the @xmath53-th occupied band and the tri @xmath4 point @xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "the product is taken over all of the occupied bands @xmath56 with only even band index due to the kramers degeneracy @xmath57 at the tri @xmath4 point . in sb@xmath0se@xmath1 system , there are four independent invariants @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the strong topological invariant and independent of the choice of primitive reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath46 , while @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 defined as weak topological invariants are not .",
    "the combination of these four independent invariants ( @xmath65 ) clearly distinguish three classes of states : non - trivial ti with either strong ti or weak ti , and ci .",
    "the calculated parities @xmath36 @xmath66 at the eight tri @xmath4 points with relative coordinates @xmath9 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , respectively , in a primitive reciprocal lattice are listed in table  [ tableparity ] .",
    "the @xmath2 topological invariant @xmath58 can be obtained by multiplying over the parities @xmath36 of all tri @xmath4 points and are also listed in table  [ tableparity ] .",
    "one can see that the @xmath2 topological invariants are @xmath7 for sb@xmath0se@xmath1 at a pressure value above p@xmath3 , indicating a non - trivial strong ti , while @xmath2 topological invariants are @xmath6 for sb@xmath0se@xmath1 at a pressure value below p@xmath3 , demonstrating a ci .",
    "this agrees with the above analyzes in that a band inversion  between the conduction band and valence band occurs at the @xmath5 point .",
    "it is also shown that a tqpt occurs at the critical pressure value p@xmath29 gpa .",
    "finally , we discuss the topological surface states based on the idea of the bulk - edge correspondence of the tis  @xcite . in order to reveal the topological features of the sb@xmath0se@xmath1 system under pressure",
    ", we calculate the topological surface states of a semi - infinite system with and without the pressure based on the surface green s function  @xcite constructed by the maximally localized wannier function fitting to first - principles band structure calculations using the method developed by marzari and co - workers  @xcite . the dispersion of the surface states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , was obtained by evaluating the imaginary part of the surface green s function . comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) and ( b ) , one can see the topological surface states , which form a single dirac cone at @xmath5 point , only exist at the pressure p@xmath35 gpa .",
    "this concludes a non - trivial ti nature and agrees well with the bulk parity analysis and band structures calculations .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed the first - principles calculations for the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the sb@xmath0se@xmath1 and predicted that there is a tqpt occurring at the critical value p@xmath29 gpa . to verify the tqpt",
    ", we firstly calculate the evolution of bulk energy gap as a function of pressure and observe the bulk energy gap closing - reopening transition .",
    "secondly , the band structure calculations show that there is a band inversion  appearing at the @xmath5 point in the bz at a pressure value above p@xmath3 , which is attributed to the pressure induced enhancement of crystal field splitting , resulting in the crossing of the conduction and valence bands .",
    "thirdly , the calculated @xmath2 topological invariant indicates that a ci phase @xmath6 and non - trivial strong ti phase @xmath7 are separated by the critical pressure value p@xmath3 .",
    "finally , the calculated dirac - like topological surface states only exist in the non - trivial strong ti phase @xmath7 region .",
    "these results can be compared directly with experimental spectroscopy techniques , such as angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy , and transport measurements .",
