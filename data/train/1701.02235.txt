    "the inflationary paradigm @xcite successfully describes the present - day homogeneity of the universe on large scales , as well as accounting for small fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , leading to a near - scale - invariant power spectrum of temperature anisotropies . according to the inflationary hypothesis ,",
    "the origin of these inhomogeneities can be traced to primordial quantum fluctuations produced during the inflationary epoch , which become stretched and amplified across the sky by the quasi - de sitter expansion . in this sense ,",
    "primordial fluctuations sow the seeds for the large - scale structure observed today .",
    "both large - scale structure and even the cmb are treated in an essentially classical way , in that they are described by classical probability densities rather than a _ quantum _ density matrix . by contrast , primordial perturbations , at least in the first instance",
    ", necessitate a quantum treatment for a consistent description .",
    "the main goal of this work is to show that under suitable approximations , the appropriate formalism for describing their dynamics involves a density matrix whose evolution is determined by a quantum master equation .",
    "it is important to stress that it is by no means guaranteed that such a master equation is consistent ",
    "i.e.  preserves positivity  but having such a formalism allows us to give a comprehensive description of the quantum dynamics and also to investigate the quantum to classical transition , bridging the gap between the two regimes described above .",
    "the conventional viewpoint ( see @xcite for a clear and condensed account ) is that perturbations are described by pure state which becomes highly squeezed as modes exit the horizon .",
    "however , this description is rather idealized in that it lacks a proper treatment of interactions with environmental fields and decoherence . consequently , it is not at all clear how the quantum state can in any way be considered classical .",
    "pure states are associated to isolated quantum systems but in reality , no system is truly isolated and will be subject to interactions with an external environment .",
    "this is the subject of open quantum systems @xcite , which provides a formalism to analyse the reduced density matrix of the particular system by tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom . in particular",
    ", this formalism provides a means to discuss the process of decoherence , which at the simplest level , leads to the decay of quantum interference in the system .",
    "seen from the perspective of the sub - system of interest , the corresponding evolution is effectively non - unitary , with initially pure states becoming mixed .",
    "coherence lengths become small and this allows one to re - interpret the system as an ensemble of classical stochastic trajectories .",
    "one can say that the classical stochastic trajectories have emerged out of the quantum system at least from a coarse - grained perspective .    whilst there is no ",
    "one - size - fits - all \" definition of  classical \" and  quantum \" , the language of open quantum systems allows us to understand the emergence of classicality in an explicit and quantifiable way .",
    "therefore , the purpose of this paper is to address the following questions :    1 .   given an explicit interaction between a system of primordial fluctuations and environment field , what approximations are needed to deduce a master equation for the reduced density matrix of the fluctuations ? 2 .",
    "importantly , under what circumstances is the master equation self - consistent and a good approximation for the full underlying schrdinger equation of the total system ? 3 .",
    "a related question is whether the relevant solutions of the master equation give rise to a physically well - behaved density matrix ?",
    "in particular , what do they tell us about the quantum to classical transition and what quantities allow us to parametrise the onset of decoherence and the emergence of classicality ?",
    "finally , how does decoherence affect entanglement ( quantum correlations ) created in the quasi - de sitter phase of inflationary expansion ?",
    "as we shall see , the squeezed pure - state picture fails to capture many important features induced by decoherence , and since primordial perturbations are not isolated ( at the very least they must interact with metric fluctuations ) a proper treatment from the point of view of open quantum systems is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of their evolution .    there are different formalisms for modelling the effects of interactions with an environment involving rather different approximations .",
    "in particular there are two key approaches : on the one hand , via a master equation , and on the other , via the so - called influence action .",
    "this latter approach can be shown , under suitable circumstances , to be equivalent to the master equation approach in flat space problems @xcite , but it is by no means clear whether this will be true in the inflationary context .",
    "although it seems the key observable of the fluctuations  the power spectrum  can be calculated in either approach with agreement @xcite .",
    "some previous works on decoherence in the inflationary context have concentrated on the influence action formalism @xcite ; however , the master equation route offers the advantage of allowing one to follow the quantum state explicitly as expansion and decoherence proceed and provides a way to calculate the growth of entropy and assess the degree to which the perturbations are classical . other important work on the cosmological perturbations , decoherence and the quantum to classical transition includes @xcite .",
    "the structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows .",
    "beginning in sec .",
    "[ philosophy ] , we discuss the quantum to classical transition in general terms and briefly review different notions of  classicality \" . here , we use the paradigm of quantum brownian motion to describe various concepts , which is particularly fitting as the mode - by - mode master equation of cosmological perturbations assumes the same schematic form .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ mastereq ] , we introduce the simplified model used to study an open system of primordial perturbations and review the derivation of the corresponding master equation outlined in @xcite .",
    "once this groundwork is laid , in sec .",
    "[ interpretation ] we provide a detailed analysis of the master equation , drawing comparisons with quantum brownian motion @xcite , where we identify the usual fluctuation - dissipation terms , in addition to the unitary coherent evolution associated to the isolated squeezed state .",
    "we find that , although the master equation is not in lindblad form , positivity of the density matrix is established on super - horizon scales , providing a natural emergence of classicality at late times .",
    "we also derive a quantum master equation for the wigner function which we use to construct a langevin - type equation for the scalar perturbations in a manner reminiscent of the attempts in @xcite and @xcite . in this sense",
    "we provide a first - principles derivation of a classical stochastic equation which reproduces the dynamics of the quantum master equation on super - horizon scales .    after introducing the various master equations , in sec .",
    "[ solsec ] we analyse in detail the behaviour of their solutions .",
    "we find that decoherence is scale - dependent , with the rate at which the environment drives the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix to zero growing as the modes exit the horizon .",
    "this behaviour is caused by the time - dependent nature of the interactions and the fact decoherence is dominated essentially by white noise on super - horizon scales .",
    "we also argue that in a particular sense , squeezing has a tendency to resist the growth of decoherence and the emergence of classicality .",
    "this behaviour can be seen most vividly at the level of the wigner function and the spread of the system in phase - space which we explore in sec .",
    "[ qtoc ] . in this section",
    "we begin by calculating the increase in entropy due to interactions with the environment and also examine the evolution of the wigner function .",
    "we find that the area of phase - space explored by the wigner function increases in time in contrast to the isolated case , where it remains constant .",
    "the wigner spread is determined by the relative strengths of squeezing and decoherence .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ discordsec ] we shall address the nature of quantum correlations in the system of perturbations . recently ,",
    "a novel approach to this question has been proposed by lim @xcite and subsequently developed in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to harness the power of correlations in the system of perturbations using _ quantum discord _ @xcite which relies on the difference between classical and quantum correlations to quantify the extent to which a particular system exhibits quantum features .",
    "it is natural to ask whether this particular measure is subdued by decoherence , which has a tendency to render quantum systems more classical .",
    "the detailed analysis of decoherence provided by our quantum master equation allows us to examine precisely this question .",
    "we find that environmental decoherence has a tendency to reduce the size of the discord and offer an interpretation of this in terms of the competing effects of particle pair creation in de sitter ( which tends to increase the strength correlations ) and random production of particles due to the environmental scatterings , which weakens the strength of correlations .",
    "in section [ discussion ] we offer our conclusions and some suggestions for future work .",
    "since our central goal to is understand how a quantum state can end up classical , the nature of the quantum to classical transition deserves some comment . we take a pragmatic view here : classical mechanics is manifestly an emergent phenomenon of quantum systems in certain circumstances and the two key issues are : ( i ) what are those circumstances ? and , ( ii ) what are the phenomenological rules that describe how the classical state emerges from an underlying quantum state ?",
    "we view the emergence of classical mechanics in the same way one views any effective theory of some underlying microscopic system",
    ". the resulting description will always be phenomenological and only appropriate to a coarse - grained perspective . by  coarse - grained \" we mean that the effective theory is couched in terms of observables that have some realistic finite resolution scales , e.g.  the dynamics of fluctuations on super - horizon scales in the cosmological setting . for observers probing these scales , an evolving quantum state is equivalent to an ensemble of classical stochastic trajectories .",
    "the final step is to postulate that an individual classical stochastic trajectory is real _ from the perspective of the coarse - grained frame of reference . _",
    "a useful toy model which has many parallels with the present investigation is the much - discussed subject of quantum brownian motion @xcite .",
    "the system consists of a particle , which , in the simplest setup , moves in one dimension , interacting with an environment .",
    "the environment can be modelled in many different ways leading to the same universal behaviour for the particle .",
    "the first level of coarse graining is to take a perspective  defined by a set of observables  which act on the particle alone , e.g.  its position and momentum . in these circumstances",
    ", one can trace out the environment and work with the reduced density matrix of the particle , @xmath0 . here",
    ", @xmath1 is the state vector of the joint environment - particle system whose evolution is unitary . in general",
    ", @xmath2 does not satisfy an autonomous dynamical equation ; however , there are circumstances for which one can derive an _ approximate _ autonomous equation for @xmath2 known as the  master equation \" . in going from the unitary evolution of the total state , to non - unitary evolution encoded in the quantum master equation , there are essentially three stages of approximation which must be made and justified :    1 .",
    "the first is the born approximation , in which one replaces the total ( pure ) state of the system @xmath3 by a product of density matrices for the particle and environment @xmath4 .",
    "the idea is that the environment is so large compared with the system ( the particle ) that in every instant the system is interacting with a fresh bit of the environment and the overall environment is barely affected by the interaction with the much smaller system .",
    "any entanglement that previously builds up between the particle and the environment is encoded in the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix of the particle which increases over time .",
    "the second approximation is the markov approximation that allows one to replace terms that depend on the history of the system by the instantaneous state @xmath2 .",
    "this approximation is justified when the dynamics of @xmath5 is suitably fast compared with the slow dynamics of the macroscopic particle .",
    "3 .   finally , the resulting equation for @xmath2 has terms that oscillate rapidly on the fast environmental time scale .",
    "temporal coarse graining amounts to removing these terms by hand in a form of rotating wave approximation @xcite .",
    "if all these steps are followed , a master equation for @xmath2 can emerge with solutions that are physically consistent , i.e.  which preserve the positivity of the the spectrum of @xmath2 .",
    "the latter is needed for a consistent density matrix which must have a spectrum @xmath6 for which @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( the normalization condition ) . in this case",
    "the master equation can be written in lindblad form . for quantum brownian",
    "motion , the form of the master equation in the position basis @xmath9 , is the caldeira - leggett master equation @xcite .",
    "@xmath10}^{\\text{unitary evol.}}-\\overbracket{\\gamma(x - x')\\big(\\frac\\partial{\\partial x}-\\frac\\partial{\\partial x'}\\big)\\rho}^{\\text{dissipation}}\\\\ & \\qquad\\qquad-\\underbracket{\\frac{2m\\gamma k_bt}{\\hbar^2}(x - x')^2\\rho}_{\\text{decoherence}}\\ .",
    "\\label{mse }    \\end{split}\\ ] ] here , @xmath11 is the hamiltonian of the particle with some additional additive terms that arise from the coupling of the particle and @xmath5 . in fact , strictly speaking , the master equation here is not in lindblad form . however , in realistic situations , the departure from positivity is small at the level of solutions , so that any contribution from non - lindblad terms can be neglected .",
    "the characteristic features of the master equation are the dissipative ( or relaxation ) and fluctuation ( decoherence ) terms .",
    "now that we have an explicit example of an open quantum system , we can ask the all - important question : what makes a state of this system  classical \" ? note that the word  classical \" is attached to quantum states in different ways .",
    "one answer is that a classical state is one which is highly localised in position and momentum , like a coherent state ( i.e.  a state which provides the minimal level of uncertainty allowed by the heisenberg relation ) .",
    "if the spread @xmath12 is much smaller than the scale over which the potential energy @xmath13 varies then ehrenfest s theorem guarantees that the quantum state follows the classical trajectory .",
    "unfortunately , this reasoning , although often invoked in textbooks , is completely unrealistic . even in free systems , wave functions",
    "spread over time .",
    "this spreading is slow for a macroscopic particle but in any chaotic system this spreading becomes remarkably fast , order @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the characteristic ( classical ) chaos time scale and @xmath16 is the characteristic ( macroscopic ) action scale of the system . in summary , we can not rely on ehrenfest s theorem to describe the quantum to classical transition ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the second use of the word  classical \" is in  semi - classical \" , or wkb states .",
    "these kinds of state are smeared along classical trajectories of the system in phase space and so are decidedly non - classical and so are not relevant for us .    finally , we have the notion of a classical state that is meaningful for the quantum to classical transition .",
    "these states are very spread out in both position and momentum .",
    "this seems paradoxical : how can such states be classical ?",
    "a state which is very spread out in this way has coherence lengths @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( the scales over which the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix fall off in position and momentum space , respectively ) which are very small compared with the coarse graining scales @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in fact for a  classical \" state , we expect @xmath21 such states must necessarily be mixed states rather than pure and can be given a useful phase space representation by using , for example , the husimi or wigner functions .",
    "we choose the latter for its ubiquity even though there is nothing fundamental about it : @xmath22 in general , there is nothing to guarantee the positivity of @xmath23 , but for a  classical state \" spread out in phase space over an area @xmath24 , @xmath23 is positive .",
    "note that the husimi function is always positive .",
    "the master equation can be written in terms of the wigner function as @xmath25 note that the quantum corrections above arise from non - linear terms in the dynamics , that is , on the derivatives of the potential @xmath13 of order three and greater . written in the form ,",
    "we can now see what causes the state to spread in phase space and become  classical \" .",
    "the decoherence term leads to diffusion of the wigner function and counteracts the tendency of the wigner function , particularly in chaotic systems , to become very structured on fine scales in phase space .",
    "thus decoherence leads to the wigner function becoming smooth , causing the coherence lengths to shrink , implying that the state becomes more and more mixed .",
    "this can be measured , for example , by the entanglement entropy , or the area of the support of the wigner function .",
    "the fact that the wigner function becomes smoothed out means that the quantum corrections in become negligible and so effectively one can describe the dynamics by the much simpler master equation @xmath26 now comes the key point for the quantum to classical transition .",
    "this simplified master equation has precisely the form of a fokker - planck equation .",
    "it describes the probability distribution associated to a classical stochastic process described by the langevin equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a gaussian white noise term with characteristics @xmath29 note the dissipation term has the form of a friction effect on the classical trajectories .",
    "the final step in the quantum to classical transition is to accept that the langevin equation describes classical trajectories that have emerged from the underlying quantum dynamics but only from the coarse - grained frame of reference .",

    "another interesting consequence of our discussion above , is that the squeezing , as characterised by the shrinking of @xmath161 , actually has a tendency to _ decrease _ the strength of decoherence , thus supressing the emergence of classicality .",

    "( 3.41 ) of @xcite one gets precisely the homogeneous terms in our langevin equation .",

    "however , in the interacting case , the @xmath302 coupling allows the numbers in the @xmath123 and @xmath124 modes to fluctuate independently beyond pair production due to @xmath326 scattering processes .",
    "therefore , if a measurement of the @xmath123 mode reveals an occupation number @xmath325 , the state of the @xmath124 mode need not contain the same number of particles .",

    "pair - production wins , leading to an increasing discord albeit at a slower rate in the interacting theory .",

    "we might expect the opposite , but that would lie beyond the perturbation theory used in our present analysis . one might question how these conclusions would be affected in the case of a different interaction hamiltonian .",
    "we leave such questions for future work .",
    "it is important to realise that , in general , many quantum features  including entanglement  are _ not _ robust to the effects of decoherence . in typical ",
    "laboratory \" setups , even the weakest of interactions leads to rapid decoherence and the decay of discord , as shown in @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is far from obvious that quantum correlations should survive the effects of environmental noise .",
    "this reveals the importance of the full analysis of decoherence , discord and entanglement presented here .",
    "the fact that quantum correlations _ do _ survive in the present case is due to the continual production of entanglement by cosmological expansion which counteracts the effects of decoherence .",
    "it is worth noting that such a mechanism is quite novel to inflation .",
    "in this work we studied the process of decoherence in inflation . by considering an explicit interaction between scalar perturbations and a conformally coupled environment field , we derived the master equation for the reduced density matrix of perturbations first presented in @xcite .",
    "we have provided a deeper analysis and interpretation of the master equation by explicitly solving for the density matrix with a gaussian ansatz and bunch davies initial conditions .",
    "this revealed a scale dependent nature of decoherence , with the rate at which off - diagonal elements of the density matrix are driven to zero growing in strength on super - hubble scales .",
    "we found that the growth of decoherence led to white noise in the emergent classical description on super - hubble scales , where memory effects become sub - dominant .",
    "in particular , we showed that potential positivity - violating effects are suppressed on super - hubble scales leading to a well behaved density matrix for modes that cross the horizon .",
    "this allowed us to construct a set of classical stochastic equations .",
    "the resulting langevin and fokker - planck equations provided an emergent classical description of the same dynamics as the quantum master equation on super - hubble scales .    in the remainder of the paper we used these tools to examine the question of the quantum to classical transition and the emergence of classicality from an initially pure quantum state . the most natural quantity to consider was the entropy , which grew in time as decoherence took effect .",
    "in particular we saw that entropy was determined solely by the ratio @xmath245 , so that the extent to which the state became mixed was controlled by the relative strength of squeezing and decoherence .",
    "we also examined the wigner function and found that the area of the wigner ellipse @xmath333 can be captured by the same ratio @xmath245 , revealing that decoherence has a tendency to increase the size of phase - space explored by the system due to diffusion .",
    "remarkably , however , the power spectrum itself was only affected in a very weak way .    finally , we turned our attention to the question of quantum correlations in the system .",
    "we used quantum discord as a measure of the strength of quantum correlations by partitioning the two - mode density matrix into @xmath334 modes .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the correlations between particle pairs created back - to - back by the de sitter expansion .",
    "it is these correlations which lead to the spacelike field correlations @xmath335 on large scales . by looking at the discord between these modes",
    ", we were able to see the effect of decoherence on the strength of quantum correlations between @xmath301 modes .    for isolated states ,",
    "pair creation induces strong correlations between the @xmath334 sectors , but environmental interactions lead to local fluctuations in the numbers in the @xmath336 and @xmath337 states , reducing the strength of correlations between the two . as a result",
    ", decoherence reduces the strength of quantum discord , and in this particular sense , renders the system more classical . however , these corrections were of @xmath338 , which for our weakly interacting system was perturbatively small and discord remained dominated by the entanglement due to pair - production .",
    "this suggests that for weakly interacting systems , at least in the pure de sitter phase of expansion , pair production dominates over decoherence effects provided the reaction rate with the environment is less than the pair - production rate characterised by @xmath268 .",
    "for this reason it is important to reproduce our analysis of discord and decoherence with other interactions .",
    "there are various avenues for developing this work .",
    "firstly , given the time - dependent nature of the interaction hamiltonian , perturbativity breaks down at late times , meaning that one can only push the analysis used here and in @xcite so far outside the horizon .",
    "one resolution to this problem might be to consider other kinds of interactions , e.g.  a marginal coupling of the form @xmath339 , which does not suffer from the same scaling .",
    "this would also provide an interesting way to probe the model - dependence of the growth in decoherence strength observed for the particular interaction considered here .    in this paper",
    "we have only considered pure de sitter expansion , rather than a complete slow - roll analysis which allows inflation to end .",
    "therefore , a more developed analysis of decoherence should include a generic inflationary potential which would allow one to see how decoherence changes as one exists the inflationary era .",
    "in particular , one might expect that once the rate of particle pair creation has dropped after inflation , decoherence may persist and wipe out any quantum discord .",
    "finally , there are many parallels with pair creation in black hole physics . indeed , both de sitter and black hole spacetimes possess horizons and exhibit hawking radiation , which is described by the reduced density matrix after tracing out the remaining member of the pair  see our eq .",

    "<S> we consider a model for the interaction between the cosmological perturbations and another environmental field during inflation , in order to study decoherence , the quantum to classical transition and the impact on quantum correlations . </S>",
    "<S> given an explicit interaction between the system and environment , we derive a quantum master equation for the reduced density matrix of perturbations , drawing parallels with quantum brownian motion , where we see the emergence of fluctuation and dissipation terms . although the master equation is not in lindblad form , we see how typical solutions exhibit positivity on super - horizon scales , leading to a physically meaningful density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to write down a langevin equation with stochastic noise for the classical trajectories which emerge from the quantum system on super - horizon scales . </S>",
    "<S> our master equation reveals many important features characteristic of the quantum to classical transition which are not captured by an isolated pure state . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that decoherence grows in strength as modes exit the horizon , and memory effects are negligible , implying that the langevin description involves white noise . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to pure states , entropy and the spread of the wigner function increase in time due to environmental interactions , with their evolution determined by the relative strength of squeezing and decoherence . finally , we use our master equation to quantify the strength of quantum correlations as captured by discord . </S>",
    "<S> we show that environmental interactions have a tendency to decrease the size of the discord , but that these corrections are perturbatively small in the coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this in terms of the competing effects of particle creation versus environmental fluctuations , which tend to increase and decrease the discord respectively . </S>"
