    "recently , a new quasi 1-d spin @xmath1 system , livge@xmath2o@xmath3 , has been the object of intensive experimental@xcite and theoretical investigations.@xcite it has an antiferromagnetic phase transition at about 25 k and the expected haldane gap is either absent or strongly suppressed .",
    "quantum chemistry calculations@xcite indicate that a second - order splitting @xmath10 of the @xmath11 orbitals may play a dominant role in this system .",
    "our new measurements indicate that @xmath10 might be much smaller than previously thought,@xcite leading to a large uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and orbital fluctuations .",
    "it has been established by neutron diffraction measurements that the low temperature phase has a rather simple , long - range antiferromagnetic order.@xcite in this paper , we report the results of a number of different nmr measurements on this material .",
    "we also address several important questions about the phase transition which remained open previously , including the order of the phase transition , the size and origin of the energy gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum below the nel temperature , and the orientation of the magnetic moments in the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "many of the results reported here were obtained on powder samples .",
    "some of the more recent measurements were made on single crystal samples .",
    "the @xmath12li nmr measurements we report include nmr spectra , the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath7 , and the spin - spin relaxation rate @xmath8 , at magnetic fields @xmath13 between 9.0 and 44.5  t and temperatures @xmath6 over the range 1.7 - 300  k. in spite of various attempts to observe the resonance signal of @xmath14v nuclei above the transition and at the lowest temperatures in the af - phase , only a tiny spurious signal could be detected in the polycrystalline sample and no signal at all was found in the single crystal samples .",
    "the 9.0  t measurements were made at ucla , the measurements between 23 and 44.5  t were done at the nhmfl in tallahassee , and measurements at 12 t were performed at the ghmfl in grenoble .",
    "we have extended previous nmr measurements on a polycrystalline powder sample@xcite to much lower temperatures as well as to much higher magnetic fields .",
    "furthermore , we present the first nmr measurements on livge@xmath2o@xmath3 single crystals as a function of the polar and azimuthal angles , which give new insides on the low temperature behavior of this system , where orbital degrees of freedom seem to play an important role .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we describe the preparation of the samples and the measurement procedures .",
    "then , we present the experimental results and a partial interpretation of some of them . in the subsequent discussion",
    "we address issues concerning the magnetic structure , the phase transition , the relaxation rate and the influence of orbital degrees of freedom .",

    "finally , the products were washed with boiling water .",
    "pale green needles were obtained , the maximum size of which was approximately 1  mm @xmath18 0.10  mm @xmath18 0.050  mm .",
    "the typical dimensions of the samples used for our nmr measurements were @xmath19 m @xmath18 @xmath20 m @xmath18 @xmath21 m , which corresponds to a mass of about 15  @xmath22 g and @xmath23 @xmath12li spins .",
    "the small nmr coils used for most of the single crystal work were a few turns of 25  @xmath22 m diameter insulated copper wire wound tightly onto the sample .",

    "the vanadium atoms are located in distorted oxygen octahedra and the three @xmath11 orbitals are split into a low - lying doublet ( @xmath25 ) and a single orbital ( @xmath26 ) at an energy @xmath10 above the doublet .",
    "all of the nmr results reported here were performed on the @xmath12li nuclei using standard spin - echo techniques carried out with a spectrometer and probes built at ucla .",
    "the nmr spectra were obtained by frequency - shifted and summed fourier transform processing@xcite with fixed applied magnetic fields between 9.0 and 44.5 tesla .",
    "rotation of the field alignment about one axis during the measurements was done by placing the sample and nmr coil on a goniometer platform whose orientation was controlled from the top of the probe .",

    "part of the uncertainty in the absolute angle was associated with the small size of the samples and part of it from thermal contraction in the goniometer control upon cooling from room temperature to low temperatures .",
    "an unsuccessful attempt was made to observe the @xmath14v nmr signal in a single crystal sample .",
    "a thorough search was done by sweeping the resonance frequency in the absence of any external field at 4.2  k as well as sweeping @xmath13 ( aligned along the @xmath9-axis ) between 0 and 14  t with @xmath6 in the range 1.5  k-5  k at the fixed frequencies 200 , 300 and 550  mhz .",

    "our @xmath8 measurements were done at 148.981  mhz in a field of 9.0  t. the pulse sequence used was a @xmath40 preparation pulse applied to @xmath34 followed a time @xmath41 later by a second pulse whose angle was set to maximize the amplitude of the echo .",
    "the integral of the spin echo signal was recorded as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "the decay of the signal was analyzed using the function : @xmath42 where @xmath38 is the stretched exponential parameter between 1 ( exponential decay ) and 2 ( gaussian decay ) . for the powder sample",
    "the @xmath38 parameter was usually left free during the fit , and resulted in values around 1.4 . the spin - echo amplitude for the single crystal measurements",

    "for example , agvp@xmath2s@xmath3 , which is a compound with a structure similar to livge@xmath2o@xmath3 , has a ratio @xmath142.@xcite therefore , it seems that the relatively high transition temperature can not be explained by the interchain coupling alone .",
