    "the solar activity cycle is believed to be a manifestation of dynamo action which somewhere in the solar interior generates waves of quasi - stationary magnetic field propagating from middle latitude towards the solar equator ( `` dynamo waves '' ) .",
    "the traditional explanation of this dynamo action @xcite is based on the joint action of differential rotation and mirror asymmetric convection which results in what has come to be known as the @xmath3-effect , based on the helicity of the hydrodynamic convective flow @xcite .",
    "this explanation is however not the only one discussed in the literature and , for example , meridional circulation is also suggested as an important co - factor of the @xmath3-effect , see e.g. , @xcite .    in turn",
    ", traditional dynamo scenarios based on differential rotation and the classical @xmath3-effect have to include a dynamo saturation mechanism .",
    "one of the most popular saturation mechanisms is based on a contribution to the @xmath3-effect from magnetic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a relevant quantification of this effect involves considerations of magnetic helicity evolution , e.g. , @xcite . a key role in the evolution of magnetic helicity",
    "is played by magnetic helicity fluxes @xcite .",
    "of course , this scenario is not the only one that has been suggested : for example @xcite consider coronal - mass ejections as an important part of nonlinear suppression of the dynamo , and @xcite discuss the effects of losses via the solar wind .",
    "@xcite believe that the current helicity in solar active regions is substantially modified when magnetic tubes rise up to the solar surface .",
    "a natural way to resolve such controversies is to determine relevant quantities such as the @xmath3-effect through observations , this providing a check on the various scenarios .",
    "such an option is now becoming realistic , starting from the 1990s when the first attempts to observe current helicity in solar active regions were undertaken @xcite .",
    "twenty years of continuous efforts by several observational groups , with the main contribution coming from the huairou solar station of china , has resulted @xcite in reconstruction of the current helicity time - latitude ( butterfly ) diagram for one full solar magnetic cycle ( 1988 - 2005 ) . from this butterfly diagram",
    "it is apparent that the current helicity is involved in the solar activity cycle and follows a polarity law comparable with the hale polarity law for sunspots  but rather more complicated . in other words ,",
    "dynamo generated magnetic field is indeed mirror asymmetric and this mirror asymmetry is involved in the solar activity cycle and can be used to understand its nature @xcite .",
    "what however needs clarification is which dynamo governing parameter is traced by such a surface proxy as a measure of current helicity in solar active regions .",
    "a naive idea here is to identify this part of the surface current helicity with the current and magnetic helicities of the dynamo generated small - scale magnetic fields deep inside the sun ( say , in the solar overshoot layer ) , which suppress dynamo action .",
    "to start with something definite , this naive interpretation was applied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recent progress in observation which has resulted in butterfly diagrams for the current helicity in active regions @xcite makes it possible to go further with this topic .",
    "the aim of this paper is to argue that the current helicity in solar active regions directly reflects _ the magnetic helicity of the large - scale dynamo generated field .",
    "_ we organize our arguments as follows .",
    "based on the observed butterfly diagram for the current helicity , we here confront the naive interpretation with the available observations .",
    "we examine a mean - field dynamo model with dynamo suppression based on the magnetic helicity balance , obtain the corresponding current helicity butterfly diagrams , and also that of the large - scale magnetic helicity , and compare them with those observed .",
    "this comparison shows that the evolution of the large - scale magnetic helicity resembles the observational data much more closely than that of the current helicity of the small - scale fields . in order to demonstrate the robustness of this result",
    ", we also consider a more primitive dynamo model , with a simple algebraic @xmath3-quenching . from this model",
    "we calculate the large - scale magnetic helicity and compare it with the observational butterfly diagram .",
    "we find that this fits observations more or less as well as that from a dynamo model based on helicity conservation .",
    "we conclude that the major part of the observed current helicity in active regions is produced in the rise of magnetic loops to the solar surface .",
    "in the evolution of the magnetic field different helicities play different roles . considering the small - scale velocity and magnetic fluctuations , @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , there are three helicities : ( i ) the kinetic helicity @xmath6 that determines the kinetic @xmath3 effect ; ( ii ) the current helicity @xmath7 that determines the magnetic part of the @xmath3 effect ; and ( iii ) the magnetic helicity @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "we use the angled brackets @xmath10 to denote spatial integrals over all relevant turbulent fluid .",
    "these integrated helicities are used in the sense of average helicity densities .",
    "the total magnetic helicity , the sum @xmath11 of the magnetic helicities of the large- and small - scale fields , @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , is conserved for very large magnetic reynolds numbers . here",
    "@xmath14 is the large - scale magnetic field .",
    "note that , on the contrary , the current helicity @xmath15 is not conserved . on the other hand ,",
    "the kinetic helicity @xmath16 is conserved only for very large fluid reynolds numbers when the large - scale magnetic field @xmath1 vanishes .",
    "the characteristic time for the decay of kinetic helicity is of the order of the turn - over time @xmath17 of turbulent eddies in the energy - containing scale , @xmath18 , of turbulence , while the characteristic time of the small magnetic helicity decay is of the order of @xmath19 @xcite , where @xmath20 is the magnetic reynolds number , @xmath21 is the characteristic turbulent velocity and @xmath22 is the magnetic diffusivity due to electrical conductivity of the fluid .",
    "the small - scale current helicity , @xmath15 is not an integral of motion and the characteristic time of @xmath15 varies from a short timescale , @xmath23 , to much larger timescales .",
    "on the other hand , the characteristic decay times of the current helicity of large - scale field , @xmath24 , and of the large - scale magnetic helicity , @xmath25 , are of the order of the turbulent diffusion time . for weakly inhomogeneous turbulence the small - scale current helicity , @xmath15 , is proportional to the small - scale magnetic helicity , @xmath13 .",
    "as the dynamo amplifies the large - scale magnetic field , the large - scale magnetic helicity @xmath26 grows in time ( but not monotonically in a cyclic system ) .",
    "the evolution of the large - scale magnetic helicity @xmath25 is determined by @xmath27 @xcite , where @xmath28 is the mean electromotive force that determines generation and dissipation of the large - scale magnetic field , @xmath29 is the source of the large - scale magnetic helicity due to the dynamo generated large - scale magnetic field , and @xmath30 is the flux of large - scale magnetic helicity that determines its transport .",
    "since the total magnetic helicity over all scales , @xmath31 integrated over the turbulent fluid , is conserved for very small magnetic diffusivity , the small - scale magnetic helicity changes during the dynamo process , and its evolution is determined by the dynamic equation @xmath32 @xcite , where @xmath33 is the source of the small - scale magnetic helicity due to the dynamo generated large - scale magnetic field , @xmath34 is the flux of small - scale magnetic helicity that determines its transport and @xmath35 is the dissipation rate of the small - scale magnetic helicity .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) and  ( [ h2 ] ) that the source of the small - scale and the large - scale magnetic helicities is located only in turbulent regions ( i.e. , in our case , in the solar convective zone ) .",
    "the magnetic part of the @xmath3 effect is determined by the parameter @xmath36 , and for weakly inhomogeneous turbulence @xmath37 is proportional to the magnetic helicity : @xmath38 @xcite , where @xmath39 is the density and @xmath40 is the turbulent magnetic diffusion .",
    "the observed butterfly diagrams of electric current helicity for solar active regions during the last two solar cycles has been presented by @xcite .",
    "the general structure can be described as follows .",
    "current helicity is involved in the solar activity cycle and follows a polarity rule comparable to ( however more complicated than ) the polarity rule for toroidal magnetic field which in turn comes from the hale polarity rule for sunspot groups . migration of the helicity pattern is clearly visible and located near the toroidal field pattern .",
    "the wings of the helicity butterflies are slightly more inclined to the equator than the magnetic field wings , but the former follow in general the latter . as a quantity quadratic in magnetic field ,",
    "the current helicity in one hemisphere has the same sign for both cycles , with the opposite sign in the other hemisphere ( a kind of unchanging dipolar symmetry ) .",
    "1 shows the distribution of the average helical characteristics of the magnetic field in solar active regions in the form of a butterfly diagram ( latitude - time ) for 1988 - 2005 ( which covers most of the 22nd and 23rd solar cycles ) .",
    "these results are inferred from photospheric vector magnetograms recorded at huairou solar observing station .",
    "this , the longest available systematic dataset covering the period of two solar cycles , comprises 6205 vector magnetograms of 984 solar active regions ( most of the large solar active regions of both solar cycles ) . of these",
    ", 431 active regions belong to the 22nd solar cycle and 553 to the 23rd .",
    "we have limited the latitudes of active regions to @xmath4140@xmath42 and most of them are below @xmath4135@xmath42 .",
    "the helicity values of the active regions have been averaged over latitude by intervals of 7@xmath42 in solar latitude , and over overlapping two - year periods of time ( i.e. , 1988 - 1989 , 1989 - 1990 , ... , 2004 - 2005 ) . by this method of averaging",
    "we were able to group sets of at least 30 data points in order to make error estimations ( computed as 95 % confidence intervals ) reasonably small . in this sampling",
    "we find that 66% ( 63% ) of active regions have negative ( positive ) mean current helicity in the northern ( southern ) hemisphere over the 22nd solar cycle and 58@xmath43 ( 57% ) in the 23rd solar cycle .",
    "there are some domains in the diagram where current helicity has the `` wrong '' sign with respect to the global polarity law .",
    "these domains of `` wrong '' sign are located at the very beginning and the very end of the wings .    concerning alternative explanations of the observations @xcite , @xcite",
    "describe current helicity in solar active regions in terms of generation of non - potential coronal structures by surface differential rotation .",
    "note that the surface differential rotation can not generate large - scale and small - scale magnetic helicity .",
    "it can only redistribute the existing magnetic helicity , as can any non - uniform large - scale motions .",
    "this process is determined by the flux term in the evolutionary equation for the magnetic helicity .",
    "the local change of the magnetic helicity inside a given active region by the surface differential rotation plays an important role . in our paper",
    "we study robust global ( rather than local ) features of the evolution of the magnetic helicity , by averaging over an ensemble of active regions . in this case",
    "the global evolution of the magnetic helicity mainly depends on the sources of magnetic helicity inside the solar convective zone .",
    "in this section we estimate the current helicity in active regions . there is a common belief that active regions are formed due to some nonaxisymmetric instability of @xmath44 kg magnetic fields in the tachocline , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of such strong fields and the role of this mechanism remain questionable @xcite .",
    "another promising mechanism of formation of active regions is related to a negative effective magnetic pressure instability of the large - scale dynamo generated magnetic field .",
    "this instability was predicted theoretically @xcite and detected recently in direct numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the instability is caused by the suppression of turbulent hydromagnetic pressure by the mean magnetic field . at large reynolds numbers and for sub - equipartition magnetic fields ,",
    "the resulting negative turbulent contribution can become so large that the effective mean magnetic pressure ( the sum of turbulent and non - turbulent contributions ) appears negative @xcite . in a stratified turbulent convection , this results in the excitation of a large - scale instability that results in the formation of large - scale inhomogeneous magnetic structures .",
    "this mechanism is consistent with the suggestion that active regions are formed near the surface of convective zone @xcite .",
    "the spatial scale of an active region is much smaller than the solar radius , but much larger then the maximum scale of solar turbulent granulation . to estimate the current helicity in an active region",
    ", we have to relate the large - scale magnetic field @xmath45 and its magnetic potential @xmath46 inside the convective zone as well as the corresponding small - scale quantities inside the convective zone ( which determine the small - scale magnetic fluctuations ) , with the surface magnetic field @xmath47 and its magnetic potential @xmath48 inside active regions , which are the quantities available to observations .",
    "we base our estimate on the following idea .",
    "consider a new - born magnetic tube at the layer in convective zone from which the active region is developing .",
    "we assume that the rise of magnetic tubes is a fast adiabatic process .",
    "let us also assume that the mean magnetic field and the total magnetic helicity vanish at the initial instant , and take into account the magnetic helicity conservation law ( as solar plasma is highly conductive , and so we consider the magnetic helicity conservation law to hold at all scales , including that of the whole sun ) .",
    "if this tube rises rapidly to the surface to produce an active region , the total magnetic helicity in the tube is conserved because the process is rapid .",
    "rising large - scale magnetic field and magnetic potential give the corresponding quantities for active regions , which may thus differ substantially from the corresponding quantities in the surrounding medium . because the initial total magnetic helicity of the tube , which was almost nonmagnetized , was negligible",
    ", the magnetic helicity conservation law reads @xmath49 where the angular brackets denote averaging over the surface occupied by the active region .",
    "now we relate the mean current helicity @xmath50 with the magnetic helicity @xmath51 .",
    "we rewrite it from the first principles with the use of permutation tensors as @xmath52 ( see appendix [ ch - mh ] ) , where @xmath53 is the solar radius , and @xmath54 is the spatial scale of an active region .",
    "equations  ( [ r5 ] ) and  ( [ rr5 ] ) yield @xmath55 therefore , the observed current helicity in active regions is expected to be a proxy for @xmath56 .",
    "this idea will be checked using mean - field dynamo numerical modelling and comparison of the numerical results with the observed current helicity in active regions .",
    "our approach to compare the dynamo models with observations is as follows .",
    "we consider two types of dynamo models .",
    "both types of models are 2d mean - field models with an axisymmetric magnetic field which depends on radius @xmath57 and polar angle @xmath58 .",
    "the third ( azimuthal ) coordinate is @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the dynamo action is based on differential rotation , with a rotation curve which resembles that of the solar convection zone , as known from helioseismological observations , and there is a conventional @xmath3-effect .",
    "the first type of model assumes a very naive algebraic @xmath3-quenching .",
    "then we suppose that the total magnetic helicity is locally vanishing , so the magnetic helicity of the large - scale magnetic field produced in the course of mean - field dynamo action has to be compensated by small - scale magnetic helicity .",
    "( thus we are assuming that at an initial instant the medium is non - magnetic , so that helicity conservation means that the sum of large and small - scale helicities remains zero . )",
    "we assume also that there is a separation of scales so that characteristic turbulence scales are much smaller than the characteristic spatial scales of mean magnetic field variations .",
    "this allows a link between current and magnetic helicities @xcite to be made .",
    "this concept underlies the observational procedure for determining the current helicity of active regions , and for calculating the current helicity from the magnetic helicity of the small - scale fields .",
    "based on the same concept we estimate the large - scale magnetic helicity as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the magnetic potential for the poloidal field . as a result",
    "we obtain ( for a given radius @xmath57 ) a theoretical model for the current helicity as a function of @xmath63 and @xmath58 which we overlay on the butterfly diagram for @xmath64 .",
    "we compare the result with the current helicity butterfly diagram known from observations and obtained using similar underlying concepts .",
    "a further point is that the primitive model allows a simplification to the level of the one - dimensional parker migratory dynamo , and this opportunity has been investigated in this respect by @xcite .",
    "we will use the results of that work for reference and comparison .",
    "we do not consider this primitive scheme as realistic .",
    "we are sure that any more or less realistic scenario for solar dynamo suppression will have to be much more sophisticated . on the other hand",
    ", we can see whether this primitive model produces a helicity butterfly diagram that is quite similar to that observed .",
    "the only shortcoming of the model is that the maximal current helicity occurs later then the maximum @xmath64 , while it is observed to come up earlier .",
    "if magnetic helicity conservation determines the nonlinear dynamo suppression , we expect that a careful reproduction of this balance , including helicity fluxes and the link between magnetic helicity and @xmath3-effect , will result in even a better theoretical butterfly diagram , and possibly improve the phase relations between helicity and toroidal magnetic field .    as a specific example of the second type model that takes into account the influence of magnetic helicity balance on dynamo action we use the dynamo model described by @xcite . whereas simple @xmath3-quenching provides a quite robust suppression of a spherical dynamo and give ( more or less ) steady nonlinear magnetic field oscillations for a very wide range of parameters , in contrast it is far from clear _ a priori _ that a dynamo suppression based on magnetic helicity conservation is effective enough to suppress magnetic field growth and result in steady oscillations .",
    "in fact it works more - or - less satisfactorily only in a quite narrow parameter range @xcite , which appears inadequate to fit observations .",
    "we note two crucial points here .",
    "first of all , both types of models ignore any direct action of magnetic force on the rotation law . in the more primitive models",
    ", there is a crude parametrization of feedback onto the ( purely hydrodynamic ) alpha effect [ see eq .",
    "( [ helic - prim ] ) ] below .",
    "the latter more sophisticated model describes the back - reaction of the generated magnetic field on the dynamo process in terms of the magnetic contribution of the current helicity onto the magnetic part of @xmath3-effect . on the other hand ,",
    "the feedback of the generated large - scale magnetic field on turbulent convection is described in our model by the algebraic quenching of @xmath3-effect , pumping velocities and turbulent magnetic diffusion .",
    "we assume that helicity conservation is not the only mechanism of dynamo suppression .",
    "the fact that we see a manifestation of helicity on the solar surface tells us that the buoyancy indeed plays some role , and we add it to the model .",
    "we stress that the buoyancy which we include in the model transports current helicity and magnetic helicity as well as large - scale magnetic field .",
    "below we discuss the detailed dynamo models .",
    "we use spherical coordinates @xmath65 and describe an axisymmetric magnetic field by the azimuthal component of magnetic field @xmath66 , and the component @xmath67 of the magnetic potential corresponding to the poloidal field .",
    "we measure length in units of the solar radius @xmath53 , and time in units of a diffusion time based on the solar radius and the reference turbulent magnetic diffusivity @xmath68 .",

    ", we use for most of these computations the code of @xcite  see also @xcite .",

    "the highly anharmonic standing patterns of the butterfly diagram that were discussed as a possible option for some stars , see @xcite , look however irrelevant for the solar case .         of course",
    ", the helicity pattern in the butterfly diagram obtained in the models for particular choices of dynamo governing parameters can be slightly different from the observed helicity patterns .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that meridional circulation can be used to make the simulated pattern resemble more closely that observed .",
    "we produced the same type of plots for models based on helicity conservation fig .",
    "we also present in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the small - scale current helicity @xmath161 . here",
    "the migration diagrams are presented for the middle radius of the dynamo region : nearer the surface @xmath161 displays only relatively weak vacillatory behaviour .",
    "we see that the small - scale current helicity is strongly concentrated in middle latitudes and helicity oscillations which are present in the model are almost invisible on the background of the intensive belt of constant helicity in middle latitudes .",
    "we doubt that such oscillations would be observable .",
    "we stress that , if this model produces any travelling helicity pattern , it is situated in the deep layers only .",
    "the pattern usually is much more similar to that presented in the right hand panel of fig .",

    "determination of further details of the location of the dynamo layer or the helicity sign inversion at some latitudes and phases of the solar cycle is beyond the scope of this investigation .",
    "such a study would require a more complex simulation , which we hope to perform in the future .",
    "the numerical models used here are extremely simple and can not be expected to sample the full range of solutions that are accessible to a three - dimensional , highly stratified , extremely turbulent system with complex and unknown boundary conditions . in the present paper we have only shown the theoretical possibility that the current helicity observed in solar active regions may trace the magnetic helicity of the large - scale dynamo generated field .",
    "we demonstrated that the results obtained with our simplified dynamo model are compatible with the observations . at the same time",
    "we note that such computationally complex and expensive simulations are still far from being able to reproduce the range of observed solar phenomena , and that for the immediate future mean field models will continue to play an important role .",
    "indeed , they may provide more immediate physical insight .",
    "the simple models which we have considered here were not intended to reproduce very fine details of the spatial - time distribution of helicity observable in the form of butterfly diagrams .",
    "we may again note that our modelling of helicity in the solar convective zone and active regions is still too simplified to be able to detect more detailed properties of the helicity dynamics .    while we feel that it is remarkable that there is a class of kinematic models that are able to reproduce the current helicity observations from vector magnetograms",
    ", we may again note that some contribution to the observed current helicity may be due to the surface effects caused by the differential rotation @xcite and not from the dynamo .",
    "we conclude that current helicity of magnetic field in active regions is a tracer of the magnetic helicity of the large - scale magnetic field in the solar interior .",
    "we believe that this provides a unique option for tracing this quantity , which is very important for the solar dynamo .",
    "according to the observational data @xcite , the current helicity in active regions is mainly negative in the northern hemisphere .",
    "numerical models give a negative value for @xmath162 in the surface layer of the convective zone in the northern hemisphere .",
    "summarizing , we conclude that the current helicity of the magnetic field in active regions is expected to have the opposite sign to @xmath163 , evaluated at the depth at which the active region originates",
    ". thus , the models presented here are consistent with the interpretation that the mechanism responsible for the sign of the observed helicity operates near the solar surface , cf .",
