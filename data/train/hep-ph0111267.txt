    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons on nucleons has remained the prime source of our understanding of the internal partonic structure of the nucleon and one of the key areas for the testing of perturbative qcd .",
    "decades of experiments on unpolarized targets have led to a rather precise determination of the unpolarized parton densities . spurred on by the famous emc experiment @xcite at cern in 1988 ,",
    "there has been a huge growth of interest in _ polarized _ dis experiments which yield more refined information about the partonic structure of the nucleon , _",
    "i.e. _ , how the nucleon spin is divided up among its constituents , quarks and gluons .",
    "many experiments have been carried out at slac , cern and desy .    in this paper",
    "we present an updated version of our nlo polarized parton densities in both the @xmath0 and the jet ( or so - called chirally invariant ) @xcite factorization schemes as well as the lo ones determined from the world data @xcite on inclusive polarized dis . comparing to our previous analysis @xcite :    i ) for the axial charges @xmath1 and @xmath2 their updated values are used @xcite : @xmath3    ii ) in our ansatz for the input polarized parton densities @xmath4 we now utilize the mrst99 set @xcite of unpolarized parton densities @xmath5 instead of the mrst98 one .",
    "iii ) the recent slac / e155 proton data @xcite are incorporated in the analysis .",
    "iv ) the positivity constraints on the polarized parton densities are discussed .",
    "the nucleon spin - dependent structure function of interest , @xmath6 , is a linear combination of the asymmetries @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( or the related virtual photon - nucleon asymmetries @xmath9 ) measured with the target polarized longitudinally or perpendicular to the lepton beam , respectively . neglecting as usual the subdominant contributions",
    ", @xmath10 can be expressed via the polarized structure function @xmath11 as @xmath12 or @xmath13 \\label{assymf2r}\\ ] ] using the relation between the unpolarized structure function @xmath14 and the usually extracted from unpolarized dis experiments @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ assym ] ) the kinematic factor @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 in ( [ g2 ] ) @xmath20 is the nucleon mass .",
    "it should be noted that in the slac and hermes kinematic region @xmath21 can not be neglected .    in the nlo qcd approximation",
    "the quark - parton decomposition of the proton structure function @xmath22 has the following form ( a similar formula holds for @xmath23 ) : @xmath24 , \\label{g1partons}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are quark , anti - quark and gluon polarized densities in the proton which evolve in @xmath27 according to the spin - dependent nlo dglap equations .",
    "@xmath28 are the nlo terms in the spin - dependent wilson coefficient functions and the symbol @xmath29 denotes the usual convolution in bjorken @xmath30 space . @xmath31 is the number of flavours .",
    "it is well known that at nlo and beyond , the parton densities as well as the wilson coefficient functions become dependent on the renormalization ( or factorization ) scheme employed . and the polarized structure function @xmath32 are independent of choice of the factorization convention . ]",
    "both the nlo polarized coefficient functions @xcite and the nlo polarized splitting functions ( anomalous dimensions ) @xcite needed for the calculation of @xmath32 in the @xmath0 scheme are well known at present .",
    "the corresponding expressions for these quantities in the jet scheme can be found in @xcite .",
    "all details of our approach to the fit of the data are given in @xcite .",
    "here we would like to emphasize only that according to this approach first used in @xcite , the nlo qcd predictions have been confronted to the data on the spin asymmetry @xmath33 , rather than on the @xmath34 .",
    "the choice of @xmath35 appears to minimize the higher twist ( ht ) contributions to @xmath36 which are expected to partly cancel with those of @xmath37 in the ratio ( [ assym ] ) , allowing use of data at lower @xmath27 ( in polarized dis most of the small @xmath30 experimental data points are at low @xmath27 ) .",
    "indeed , we have found @xcite that if for @xmath38 and @xmath39 _ leading - twist _ ( lt ) qcd expressions are used in ( [ assym ] ) , the ht corrections @xmath40 to @xmath41 , extracted from the data , are negligible and consistent with zero within the errors ( see fig .",
    "( note that the polarized parton densities in qcd are related to the leading - twist expression of @xmath38 . ) on other hand , it was shown @xcite that if @xmath42 and @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ assymf2r ] ) are taken from experiment ( as has been done in some of the analyses ) the higher twist corrections to @xmath44 are sizeable and important .",
    "so , in order to extract the polarized parton densities from @xmath38 data the ht contribution to @xmath38 ( unknown at present ) has to be included into data fit .",
    "note that a qcd fit to the @xmath38 data keeping in @xmath45 only the leading - twist expression leads to some `` effective '' parton densities which involve in themselves the ht effects and therefore , are not quite correct .",
    "these results suggest that in order to determine polarized parton densities less sensitive to higher twist effects , it is preferable at present to analyze @xmath44 data directly using for @xmath38 and @xmath39 their leading twist expressions .",
    "bearing in mind this discussion one must be careful when comparing the polarized parton densities determined from the inclusive dis data with those extracted from semi - inclusive dis data @xcite .",
    "the results will depend , especially in a lo qcd analysis , upon whether the higher twist terms are or are not taken into account .",
    "+ following the procedure of our previous analyses we have extracted the nlo ( as well as lo ) polarized parton densities from the fit to the world data on @xmath46 using for the flavour non - singlet combinations of their first moments @xmath47 @xmath48 the sum rule values ( [ ga,3fd ] ) . the sensitivity of the polarized parton densities to the deviation of @xmath2 from its su(3 ) flavour symmetric value ( 0.58 ) has been studied and the results are given in @xcite . here",
    "we will present only the polarized parton densities corresponding to the su(3 ) symmetric value of @xmath2 in ( [ ga,3fd ] ) .",
    "what we can deduce from inclusive dis in the absence of charged current neutrino data is the sum of the polarized quark and anti - quark densities @xmath49 and the polarized gluon density @xmath50 .",
    "the non - strange polarized sea - quark densities @xmath51 and @xmath52 , as well as the valence quark densities @xmath53 and @xmath54 : @xmath55 can not be determined without additional assumptions about the flavour decomposition of the sea . nonetheless ( because of the universality of the parton densities ) they are of interest for predicting the behaviour of other processes , like polarized @xmath56 reactions , etc .",
    "that is why , we extract from the data not only the quark densities ( [ qqb ] ) and @xmath50 , but also the valence parts @xmath53 , @xmath54 and anti - quark densities using the assumption on the flavour symmetric sea @xmath57    for the input lo and nlo polarized parton densities at @xmath58 we have adopted a very simple parametrization @xmath59 where on rhs of ( [ classic ] ) we have used the mrst98 ( central gluon ) @xcite and mrst99 ( central gluon ) @xcite parametrizations for the lo and nlo(@xmath0 ) unpolarized densities , respectively .",
    "the normalization factors @xmath60 in ( [ classic ] ) are fixed such that @xmath61 are the first moments of the polarized densities .",
    "the first moments of the valence quark densities @xmath62 and @xmath63 are constrained by the sum rules ( [ ga,3fd ] ) .",
    "the rest of the free parameters in ( [ classic ] ) , @xmath64 have been determined from the best fit to the data .",
    "the guiding arguments to choose for the input polarized parton densities the ansatz ( [ classic ] ) are simplicity ( not too many free parameters ) and the expectation that polarized and unpolarized densities have similar behaviour at large @xmath30 .",
    "also , such an ansatz allows easy control of the positivity condition , which in lo qcd implies : @xmath65    the constraints ( [ pos ] ) are consequence of a probabilistic interpretation of the parton densities in the naive parton model , which is still correct in lo qcd . beyond",
    "lo the parton densities are not physical quantities and the positivity constraints on the polarized parton densities are more complicated .",
    "they follow from the positivity condition for the polarized lepton - hadron cross - sections @xmath66 with the unpolarized ones ( @xmath67 ) and include also the wilson coefficient functions .",
    "it was shown @xcite , however , that for all practical purposes it is enough at the present stage to consider lo positivity bounds , since nlo corrections are only relevant at the level of accuracy of a few percent .",
    "in this section we present the numerical results of our fits to the world data on @xmath68 .",
    "the data used ( 185 experimental points ) cover the following kinematic region : @xmath69    the total ( statistical and systematic ) errors are taken into account .",
    "the systematic errors are added quadratically .",
    "we prefer to discuss the nlo results of analysis in the jet scheme . to compare our nlo polarized parton densities with those extracted by other groups , we present them also in the usually used @xmath0 scheme using the renormalization group transformation rules for the parton densities .",
    "it is useful to recall the transformation rules relating the first moments of the singlet quark density , @xmath70 , and the strange sea , @xmath71 , in the jet and @xmath0 schemes :    @xmath72    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the first moment of the polarized gluon density @xmath75 ( note that @xmath76 is the same in the factorization schemes under consideration ) .    a remarkable property of the jet ( and so - called adler - bardeen ( ab )",
    "@xcite ) schemes is that the singlet @xmath70 , as well as the strange sea polarization @xmath71 , are @xmath77 _ independent _ quantities .",
    "then , in these schemes it is meaningful to directly interpret @xmath78 as the contribution of the quark spins to the nucleon spin and to compare its value obtained from dis region with the predictions of the different ( constituent , chiral , etc . )",
    "quark models at low @xmath27 .",
    "it is important to mention that the difference between the values of the strange sea polarization , obtained in the @xmath0 and jet schemes could be _ large _ if @xmath76 in ( [ dels_j_ms ] ) is positive and large . to illustrate how large it can be ,",
    "we present the values of @xmath79 at @xmath80 obtained in our analysis of the world dis data in the @xmath0 and jet schemes ( @xmath81 ) : @xmath82 note that if @xmath76 is larger than 0.68 , @xmath83 could _ vanish _ in agreement with what is intuitively expected in quark models at low-@xmath27 region ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "+ the numerical results of our fits to the data are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the best lo and nlo(jet ) fits correspond to @xmath85 per degree of freedom of @xmath86 and to @xmath87 . in lo",
    "qcd @xmath50 does not contribute directly in @xmath38 and the gluons can not be determined from dis data alone .",
    "for that reason the lo fit to the data was performed using for the input polarized gluon density @xmath88 that one extracted by the nlo fit to the data : @xmath89 we consider that such a procedure leads to non - realistic errors of the rest of parameters and therefore , we present only their central values in table 1 .",
    "it is important to note that in the polarized case the lo approximation has some peculiarities compared to the unpolarized one .",
    "as has been already mentioned above , as a consequence of the axial anomaly , the difference between nlo anti - quark polarizations @xmath90 in different factorization schemes could be quite large , in order of magnitude of @xmath90 themselves . in this case",
    "the leading order will be a bad approximation , at least for the polarized sea - quark densities extracted . also , bearing in mind that in polarized dis most of the data points are at low @xmath27 , lower than the usual cuts in the analyses of unpolarized data ( @xmath91 ) , the nlo corrections to all polarized parton densities are large in this region and it is better to take them into account .",
    "nevertheless , the lo polarized parton densities may be useful for many practical purposes : for preliminary estimations of the cross sections in future polarized experiments , etc . for that reason we present them in this paper , at @xmath80 ( see fig . 2 and appendix ) and for any @xmath27 in the region : @xmath92 ( the fortran code is available ) .",
    "further , we will discuss mainly the nlo qcd results .    as in our previous analysis",
    "@xcite a very good description of the world data on @xmath93 and @xmath94 is achieved .",
    "the new nlo theoretical curves for @xmath44 corresponding to the best fit practically coincide with the old ones ( see fig .",
    "the agreement with the slac / e155p data involved in this analysis is also very good .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "4 . the nlo qcd theoretical predictions for @xmath44 corresponding to our previous analysis of the data are also shown .",
    "they are in a good agreement with the slac / e155 data not available at the time our previous analysis was performed . in fig .",
    "5 we compare the new nlo @xmath38 curves with the smc and slac / e143 proton data . the extrapolations for @xmath95 in the yet unmeasured small @xmath30 region at different @xmath27 are also shown . as seen from fig . 5 , the proton spin dependent structure function @xmath95 changes sign at @xmath30 smaller than @xmath96 and becomes negative if the gluon polarization is positive .",
    "one of the challenges to future polarized dis experiments is to confirm or reject this behaviour , quite different from the usual regge type behaviour .",
    "the extracted nlo(jet ) polarized parton densities at @xmath80 are shown in figs .",
    "6(a ) and 6(b ) .",
    "( the explicit expressions are given in the appendix . )",
    "the new parton densities are found to be within the error bands of the old ones .",
    "the positivity constraints have not been imposed during the fit . except for the strange sea density @xmath97 , the polarized parton densities determined from the data are compatible with the lo positivity bounds ( [ pos ] ) imposed by the mrst99 unpolarized parton densities .",
    "however , if one uses the _ more accurate _ lo positivity bounds on @xmath97 obtained by using the unpolarized strange sea density @xmath98 ( barone et al .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath97 also lies in the allowed region .",
    "it is important to mention that @xmath98 is determined with a higher accuracy compared to other global fits .    in fig .",
    "7 we illustrate the difference between the singlet quark density @xmath99 and the strange sea density @xmath100 determined in the jet and @xmath0 schemes at @xmath80 . they differ essentially in the small @xmath30 region and this difference increases with @xmath76 increasing . in figs . 8(a ) and 8(b ) we compare our nlo(@xmath0 ) polarized parton densities with those obtained by aac @xcite and grsv @xcite using almost the same set of data .",
    "this comparison is a good illustration of the present situation in polarized dis .",
    "while the quality and the kinematic range of the data are sufficient to determine the valence polarized densities @xmath53 and @xmath53 with a good accuracy ( if an su(3 ) symmetry of the flavour decomposition of the sea is assumed ) , the polarized strange quark density @xmath101 as well as the polarized gluon density @xmath50 are still weakly constrained , especially @xmath76 .",
    "finally , let us turn to the quark and gluon polarizations ( the first moments of the polarized parton densities ) .",
    "the results of the new as well as of the old analysis are presented in table 2 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the corresponding values in the @xmath0 scheme are also given .",
    "the changes of the central values of the parton polarizations ( jet scheme ) are negligible and within the errors of the quantities .",
    "note that for the central value of the axial charge @xmath103 ( equal to @xmath104 in @xmath0 scheme ) we obtain now somewhat smaller value : @xmath105 than the old one : @xmath106 .",
    "the values of the lo parton polarizations are between those of the jet and @xmath0 schemes .    for the gluon polarization @xmath76",
    "corresponding to the best nlo(jet ) fit we have found @xmath107 at @xmath102 .",
    "however , if one takes into account the sensitivity of @xmath76 to variation of the non - singlet axial charge @xmath2 from its su(3 ) symmetric value of 3f - d , the positive values of @xmath76 could lie in the wider range [ 0 , 1.5 ] @xcite .",
    "a negative @xmath76 is still _ not _ excluded from the present dis inclusive data .",
    "we have re - analyzed the world data on inclusive polarized deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering in leading and next - to - leading order of qcd adding to the old set of data the slac / e155 proton data .",
    "compared to our previous analysis : i ) the updated values for the non - singlet axial charges @xmath108 and @xmath2 and ii ) in the ansatz for the input polarized parton densities the mrst99 set of unpolarized parton densities instead of the mrst98 one have been used .",
    "it was demonstrated that the polarized dis data are in an excellent agreement with the pqcd predictions for @xmath46 and @xmath109 and that the new theoretical curves practically coincide with the old ones .",
    "a new set of nlo polarized parton densities in the jet and @xmath0 factorization schemes as well as lo polarized patron densities have been extracted from the data .",
    "we note that one must be careful when using lo polarized densities .",
    "the lo qcd approximation could be a bad one , at least for the polarized sea - quark densities , if it will turn out that the gluon polarization is positive and large ( the first direct measurement of @xmath76 @xcite as well as the qcd analyses support such a possibility ) .",
    "we have found that the new nlo(jet ) polarized parton densities do not change essentially and lie within the error bands of the old parton densities .",
    "what follows from our analysis is that the limited kinematic range and the precision of the present generation of inclusive dis experiments are enough to determine with a good accuracy only the polarized parton densities @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the polarized strange sea density @xmath112 as well as the polarized gluon density @xmath50 are still weakly constrained , especially @xmath76 .",
    "the non - strange polarized sea - quark densities @xmath113 and @xmath114 can not be determined , in principle , from the inclusive dis experiments alone without additional assumptions .",
    "the further study of flavour decomposition of the sea as well as a more accurate determination of the gluon polarization are important next steps in our understanding of the partonic structure of the nucleon and this will be done in the forthcoming and future polarized lepton - hadron and hadron - hadron experiments . + a fortran package containing our nlo polarized parton densities in both the jet and @xmath0 factorization schemes as well as lo parton densities can be found at http://durpdg.dur.ac.uk/hepdata/pdf or obtained by electronic mail : + sidorov@thsun1.jinr.ru or stamenov@inrne.bas.bg .",
