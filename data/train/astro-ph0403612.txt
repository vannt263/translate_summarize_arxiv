    "psr b1259@xmath063 was discovered in a large - scale high frequency survey of the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "it is unique because it is the only known radio pulsar in orbit about a massive , main - sequence , b2e star @xcite .",
    "psr b1259@xmath063 has a short spin period of @xmath248  ms and moderate period derivative of @xmath3 , implying a characteristic age of only 330  kyr from spin - down by magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "it has an orbital period of @xmath21237 days , and an eccentricity of 0.87 , the longest orbital period and largest eccentricity of any of the known binary radio pulsars .",
    "the inclination of the orbit to the plane of the sky is @xmath4 .",
    "the companion , ss 2883 , is a 10th magnitude star with a mass of about 10  @xmath5 and a radius of 6  @xmath6 .",
    "typical of be stars as a class , it has a hot , tenuous polar wind and a cooler , high density , equatorial disk .",
    "the mass loss rate of the b2e star is @xmath7",
    "johnston et al .",
    "( 1994 ) observed h@xmath8 emission lines from the disk at 20 stellar radii ( r@xmath9 ) , just inside the pulsar orbit of 24 r@xmath9 at periastron .",
    "the density of the disk material is high near the stellar surface ( @xmath10  @xmath11 ) , and falls off as a power - law with distance from the star .",
    "the disk is likely to be highly tilted with respect to the pulsar orbital plane , and psr b1259@xmath063 is eclipsed for about 40 days as it goes behind the disk .",
    "assuming the b2e star is rotating at @xmath270 per cent of its break up velocity @xcite , ss 2883 then has an equatorial velocity @xmath2280  kms@xmath12 .",
    "the spin - induced oblateness of the star implies an additional @xmath13 gravitational potential term in the interaction with the pulsar , known as quadrupole gravitational moment in typical binary system .",
    "this effect introduces an apsidal motion and precession of the orbital plane if the spin of the companion is not aligned with the orbit angular momentum , characterised by @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , where @xmath16 is the longitude of periastron passage and @xmath1 is the projected pulsar semi - major axis @xcite .    in an eccentric binary system ,",
    "the passage of the pulsar through periastron excites tidal motions on the companion star which then interact with the orbital motion . in the case of psr j0045@xmath07319 @xcite",
    ", tidal effects may account for the observed evolution in binary parameters ( e.g. lai 1997 ) .",
    "the tidal interactions may be enhanced by large factors if there is a resonance with oscillation modes of the star @xcite . for psr j0045@xmath07319 , at periastron",
    "the pulsar is only @xmath17 r@xmath9 from the companion compared to 24 r@xmath9 for psr b1259@xmath063 .",
    "tidal effects are strongly dependent on the separation of the two stars , and so may be insignificant in psr b1259@xmath063 .",
    "interactions between the pulsar and the disk of the be star may also be important .",
    "if there is accretion from the disk on to the neutron star , the pulsar may be spun up or slowed down . for accretion to occur ,",
    "the bow shock , where there is pressure balance between the pulsar wind and the be - star disk gas , must lie inside the accretion radius , which depends on relative velocity of the pulsar and the accreting gas . for psr b1259@xmath063 ,",
    "accretion is unlikely @xcite , with x - ray observations @xcite most easily interpreted as originating from a bow shock well outside the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "disk interactions may also affect pulsar orbit directly through frictional drag .",
    "estimates @xcite of variations in the keplerian parameters @xmath18 , @xmath16 and @xmath19 suggest the effect is negligible .",
    "timing models for binary pulsars have evolved over the years , mainly to take into account general relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "wex ( 1998 ) extended these models to deal with long - period systems with main sequence companions .",
    "his model , the so - called mss model , accounts for short - term periodic orbital effects and for the long - term secular effects caused by classical spin - orbit coupling .    the latest paper on timing of psr  b1259@xmath063 @xcite analysed observations from 1990 january to 1996 december which covered the 1990 and 1994 periastron passages .",
    "wex et al . (",
    "1998 ) were unable to derive a unique timing model for the system , partly because of the large timing noise and partly due to the long eclipses of the pulsed emission .",
    "they put forward two possible solutions for the timing . in one ,",
    "timing noise dominated , its effects were removed through higher order derivatives of the spin frequency , and there was no orbital precession or tidal effects . in the second model , which they preferred , significant values of @xmath14 and @xmath20 were obtained .",
    "these were interpreted as being due to orbital precession , and a large tilt between the rotation axis of the be star and the orbital angular momentum vector was inferred .",
    "two different fits were obtained for @xmath14 and @xmath20 depending on the number of ( integer ) rotations added during the 1994 eclipse .",
    "the preferred solution then relied on the physical interpretation of the values of @xmath14 and @xmath20 .",
    "since then , we have obtained a further six years of timing data on this pulsar to give a total data span of 13 years , including two further periastron passages in 1997 and 2000 .",
    "our main findings are : ( 1 ) that there is strong evidence for a pulsar period glitch in 1997 august , about 94 days after the 1997 periastron , ( 2 ) that the wex et al .",
    "( 1998 ) timing solution which included orbital precession does not remain valid through the 1997 and 2000 periastrons , ( 3 ) that a solution with jumps in @xmath21 and @xmath22 at each periastron , while fitting the data reasonably well , is unlikely to be physically viable , and ( 4 ) that the data are best explained by a combination of the 1997 august pulsar glitch and steps in projected orbit semi - major axis ( @xmath1 ) at each periastron .",
    "however , the possible presence of timing noise and the long - duration eclipses conspire to make timing of the pulsar difficult . in section  [ sec : obs ]",
    "we discuss details of the observations and data analysis techniques , section  [ sec : prf ] describes the pulse profile evolution from 0.66 to 13.6  ghz and section  [ sec : ddm ] describes the dispersion measure variations observed around the 1994 , 1997 and 2000 periastrons .",
    "the timing results are described in section  [ sec : tim ] with fits of the various possible models , and the possible interpretations are discussed in section  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "we report here on observations of psr b1259@xmath063 using the parkes radio telescope over a time interval of nearly 5000 days between 1990 january and 2003 june ( mjd 47909 to 52804 ) .",
    "a total of 1031 times of arrival ( toas ) , spanning four orbital periods , were obtained for the pulsar .",
    "the majority of the observations were made at frequencies around 1.4  ghz with additional observations at 0.66 , 2.4 , 4.8 , 8.4 and 13.6  ghz .    at 1.4  ghz , the h -",

    "short observations with duration @xmath210  min were made at typically two - week intervals far from periastron .",
    "longer observations with duration @xmath21  hr were made on a daily basis at times close to periastron .",
    "the higher frequency observations were generally conducted close to the epochs of periastron in order to measure the dispersion measure changes and the scatter broadening of the pulse profile @xcite .",
    "the receivers at 4.8 and 8.4  ghz had system equivalent flux densities of @xmath2100  jy .",
    "lower frequency observations were more rarely performed . the combination of increased galactic background emission at low frequencies , and the flat spectral index of the pulsar , made it hard to detect .",
    "the backend systems included various combinations of filterbanks and correlators .",
    "table  [ tb : system ] lists the details of the observing systems .",
    "filterbank systems were used throughout the observation period . at frequencies above 1  ghz",
    ", they generally consisted of 64 frequency channels each of width 5  mhz ( 1991 - 1997 ) , 96 channels of width 3  mhz ( 1997 - 203 ) or 512 channels of width 0.5  mhz ( 2001 onwards ) .",
    "the filterbank backends were only capable of measuring total power .",
    "they one - bit sampled the data typically at intervals of 600  @xmath23s for this pulsar .",
    "the data stream was written to tape for subsequent off - line analysis .",
    "this analysis involved de - dispersing and folding the data at the topocentric period .",
    "a digital correlator , the caltech fast pulsar timing machine ( fptm ; navarro 1994 ) , was in use between 1994 and 2001 .",
    "it had 128  mhz of bandwidth with 128 frequency channels .",
    "when operating in total power mode , two independent 128  mhz bands were available .",
    "when full stokes parameters were recorded , however , only one band could be used .",
    "the correlator performed on - line pulse - folding and dedispersion to produce a pulse profile with up to 1024 time bins per period .",

    "( 1998 ) , prior to the 1997 periastron , an excellent fit could be obtained by fitting for the pulsar frequency , its first two derivatives , the kepler parameters and jumps in just @xmath1 at the 1990 and 1994 periastrons . however , with the full data set and fitting for @xmath37 at the remaining two periastrons , large systematic residuals were obtained .",

    "[ sec : dis ]      psr b1259@xmath063 is a relatively young pulsar with a large frequency derivative which is likely to have a high level of timing noise @xcite .",
    "arzoumanian et al . (",
    "1994 ) proposed a measure of the timing noise to be @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the time span over which the pulsar has been observed . for psr b1259@xmath063",
    "we have @xmath43  s and for the measured value of the frequency and its second derivative we obtain @xmath44 .",
    "this is very close to the value for other pulsars with similar frequency derivatives , showing that psr b1259@xmath063 is typical in this respect .",
    "the derived braking index , @xmath45 , for psr b1259@xmath063 is @xmath46 .",
    "again , this merely reflects the relatively high level of timing noise in this young pulsar @xcite .",
    "the absence of systematic residual variations after fitting for steps in projected semi - major axis at each periastron ( fig .",
    "[ fg : obj]b ) suggests that the timing noise is very red ; higher - order derivatives in spin frequency are not significant .",
    "[ fg : jumps ] shows that jumps in pulsar frequency and frequency derivative at periastron can account for most of the observed systematic residuals . as discussed by manchester et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the most probable cause of frequency jumps at periastron is accretion of mass and angular momentum from the be - star disk .",
    "the observed @xmath34 are of order @xmath29 hz , requiring accretion of about @xmath47 g at the alfvn radius of @xmath48 cm .",
    "while this amount of accreted mass is not unreasonable , there are several problems with this idea .",
    "firstly , the bow shock between the pulsar wind and the circumstellar wind must lie inside the accretion radius for accretion to occur .",
    "kaspi et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and tavani & arons ( 1997 ) argued that this implies unreasonably high values for the disk density and/or outflow velocity .",
    "secondly , the observed @xmath34 are of different magnitudes and signs at the different periastrons . while there is evidence from the unpulsed continuum emission that wind parameters vary from one periastron to the next @xcite , it would be surprising if the accretion torque were able to change sign .",
    "a further problem with this explanation for the observed timing residuals is that frequency jumps alone do not account for the observed variations ; jumps in frequency derivative are also required .",
    "in fact , the @xmath28 jumps are generally more significant than the jumps in @xmath21 ( table  [ tb : para ] ) .",
    "the implied changes in braking torque or moment of inertia are large and physically improbable .",
    "these changes in @xmath28 could result from timing noise , but the fact that they are concentrated at the periastrons suggests that this is unlikely .",
    "it is clear from section  [ sec : wex ] that secular changes in @xmath16 and @xmath49 do not account for the observed timing behaviour of psr b1259@xmath063 , although it worked well for the first two periastrons .",
    "this is reinforced by the fact that the fitted jumps in @xmath1 ( section  [ sec : btj ] ) are of different sign at the different periastrons .",
    "this appears to mean that the conclusions drawn by wex et al .",
    "( 1998 ) about the inclination of the be - star spin axis to the orbital plane may no longer be valid .",
    "we note that the @xmath20 measured by wex et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is roughly consistent with the step change in @xmath1 at the 1994 periastron described in section  [ sec : btj ] .",
    "it is never - the - less striking that jumps at each periastron in projected semi - major axis _ only _ are required to satisfactorily model the data .",
    "limits on changes to the other orbital parameters are at least an order of magnitude less than the values used in the simulations of fig .",
    "[ fg : many ] .",
    "the systematic residual variations seen in fig .  [ fg : nowx]b are well modeled by the step changes in @xmath1 at each periastron and small adjustments in the other orbital parameters .",
    "if these variations are due to timing noise , the noise must mimic the effect of changes in the orbital parameters , that is , be smooth between periastrons and rapid near periastrons , which seems unlikely .    if the jumps in @xmath1 are interpreted as changes in semi - major axis @xmath50 , kepler s third law implies changes in @xmath18 of order thousands of seconds , orders of magnitude larger than permitted by the timing solutions ( cf .",
    "[ fg : many ] ) .",
    "the observed changes in @xmath1 must then be interpreted as changes in inclination angle @xmath51 of the orbit of order a few arcsec .",
    "the question then is : what can cause changes in inclination angle without making significant perturbations to the other orbital parameters ? furthermore , the mechanism must be able to produce changes of different sign and magnitude at different periastrons .",
    "there is evidence that the be - star disk is highly inclined to the orbital plane both from observations of the pulsed emission @xcite and the unpulsed emission @xcite , so the velocity of the disk material would have a significant component perpendicular to the orbit . in principle , frictional drag could then tilt the orbit .",
    "it is also known that the properties of the wind interaction vary substantially from orbit to orbit .",
    "the problem is that this effect could only change the orbit inclination with one sign and manchester et al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggest that the fractional change of orbital energy due to this effect is @xmath52 , too small to account for the observed changes .",
    "the other possible mechanism appears to be tidal interactions occurring at each periastron @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in section 1 , these effects can be greatly enhanced by resonances with modes of stellar oscillations .",
    "since there is evidently a large angle between the spin axis and the orbit normal , again it is possible that the dominant effect could be on the orbit inclination .",
    "different relative phases of the tides and stellar oscillations could alter the effect on the orbit from one periastron to the next .",
    "calculations to date ( e.g. witte & savonije 1999 ) have only considered aligned systems . however , once again , the predictions are that the effects would not be significant for psr b1259@xmath063 because of the relatively large ratio of periastron distance to companion - star radius .",
    "we have presented an analysis of 13 years of timing data encompassing four periastron passages of psr b1259@xmath063 .",
    "significant changes in dispersion measure occurring near each periastron were accounted for in the data analysis .",
    "it is clear that secular changes in orbit parameters due to spin - orbit coupling does not give a good description of the data .",
    "the effect of timing noise is difficult to quantify because of coupling with the orbital parameters , a problem exacerbated by the long - duration eclipses which occur at each periastron .",
    "consequently , we can not rule out the possibility that our measured parameters are affected by timing noise .",
    "however , excepting the glitch which occurred near mjd 50691 , the fact that within each orbit the observed residuals show variations with characteristic timescale of the same order as the orbital period and significant shorter - term variations only near the periastrons strongly suggests that changes in orbital parameters at periastron are the dominant effect .",
    "this is reinforced by the excellent fit to the data by a model containing the mjd 50691 glitch and steps in projected semi - major axis at each periastron .",
    "it is clear that these steps must result from step changes in the orbit inclination .",
    "however , we are unable to offer any plausible mechanism to account for the observed changes .",
    "the australia telescope is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by the csiro .",
    "we would like to thank all the many pulsar observers who have contributed to collecting timing data over the 13 years of this project .",
