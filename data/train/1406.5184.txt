    "<S> @xcite for @xmath122 t and @xmath123 t , respectively , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( inset ) .    </S>",
    "<S> as seen above , cdw order scales with @xmath73 but not @xmath65 and hence @xmath124 is independent of @xmath65 . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 it is clear that @xmath125 while @xmath54 is essentially independent of @xmath65 for fixed @xmath73 , and @xmath126 , @xmath127 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we expect the total activation gap for the @xmath64 hall state , @xmath128 , to vary _ linearly _ with @xmath65 for fixed @xmath73 since @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> recently , scaling of the gap at @xmath64 has been explored in tilted magnetic fields for various fixed values of @xmath73 , showing _ linear _ scaling with @xmath77 . however , the observed slope is _ larger _ than that for single - particle zeeman coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our proposed scenario for the existence of an underlying spin gap ( @xmath130 ) due to finite @xmath84 , immediately provides an explanation for the observed _ enhanced _ </S>",
    "<S> slope for the @xmath64 hall state in a tilted magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> alternatively the @xmath64 hall state can form through the generation of two components of _ kekule bond density wave _ ( </S>",
    "<S> kbdw ) order , which lift the degeneracy of the zll by forming linear combinations of the zll states localized on opposite sublattices . </S>",
    "<S> these orders , together with the cdw order constitute an @xmath131 vector . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a _ skyrmionic _ </S>",
    "<S> excitation of such an @xmath131 order can , in principle , be realized at @xmath64 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , kbdw order can only be realized when nn and next - nn repulsions are comparable @xcite , while cdw is the natural ground state for nn coulomb repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the onsite repulsion supports a finite @xmath84 at @xmath64 , which in turn gives rise to cdw order . </S>",
    "<S> hence , short - range components of the coulomb interaction introduce a _ strong anisotropy _ among the components of this @xmath131 vector , which may preempt the appearance of skyrmionic defects at @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the cdw order we proprose at @xmath64 could , for example , be established by using sublattice resolved stm measurements , and the easy - axis afm order could be probed using spin - resolved stm .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , we address the nature of the broken symmetry phases at @xmath5 in mlg , and establish excellent agreement with recent experiments in perpendicular and tilted magnetic fields @xcite . at @xmath23 , onsite repulsion leads to easy - plane afm order and fm order aligned with the applied field . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 state has some superficial similarity with the interlayer canted antiferromagnetic hall state in bilayer gaas @xcite at even integer filing , which has a different origin from the one in mlg . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state at @xmath64 simultaneously supports an easy - axis afm and a cdw , favored by onsite and nn repulsions respectively . </S>",
    "<S> since easy - plane and easy - axis nel orders break time - reversal - symmetry , @xmath5 hall states remain robust in the presence of generic time - reversal - symmetric disorders @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we provide several suggestions for experiments to test the scenario we propose . with spin and valley degeneracies completely lifted by </S>",
    "<S> the csb orders the standard jain sequence of fractional hall states can be observed for @xmath132 and @xmath133 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , even numerator fractions are less stable than the odd ones when @xmath133 , which may arise from the simultaneous spin and charge ordering in @xmath134 but with a much larger charge gap than spin gap .    </S>",
