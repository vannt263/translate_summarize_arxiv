    "in this paper we concentrate on comparison to the 2013 lhc @xmath3pb data on quarkonium production at @xmath4 tev . the inclusive @xmath5 and @xmath6 production data , binned as a function of rapidity and @xmath0 ( @xmath5 ) or rapidity alone ( @xmath6 ) , come from the alice @xcite and lhcb @xcite collaborations .",

    ".    runs with mass asymmetric beams are different at the lhc than at rhic because the lhc beams are not symmetric in energy .",
    "instead , in the 2013 lhc @xmath3pb run a 4 tev proton beam interacted with a @xmath7 tev / nucleon pb beam .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon center of mass frame does not coincide with the laboratory frame in an energy - asymmetric collision system .",
    "instead the center of mass frame is shifted by @xmath8 , taken to be in the direction of the proton beam , as defined by experiments .",
    "in addition , the alice and lhcb detector systems are not symmetric around the interaction point , with muon spectrometers on only one side of midrapidity .",
    "therefore the beams have to be run in two modes , pb@xmath9 and @xmath3pb . in the first case",
    "the lead beam is defined to move toward forward rapidity while in the second , the proton beam does . because the second configuration is most similar to fixed - target operation and corresponds to small parton momentum fractions in the nucleus",
    ", both setups are analyzed according to the convention that the proton beam moves to positive rapidity .",
    "thus the case of pb@xmath9 collisions corresponds to larger parton momentum fractions in the nucleus .",
    "the alice @xmath5 measurement has been presented in both the central and forward / backward regions .",
    "their muon spectrometer covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath10 in the laboratory frame . due to the rapidity shift in the asymmetric energy beams ,",
    "the backward rapidity range for dimuon coverage is @xmath11 while the forward rapidity range for dimuon coverage is @xmath12 .",
    "the alice central detector includes dielectron coverage for @xmath13 .",
    "the quarkonium measurements in this region correspond to the rapidity range @xmath14 .",
    "the lhcb detector covers @xmath15 in the laboratory frame . like alice",
    ", they define the forward direction as the direction of the proton beam so that their backward coverage is @xmath16 and the forward coverage is @xmath17 .    because there is not yet a measured @xmath2 baseline , the nuclear modification factor",
    ", @xmath18 relies on an interpolation of the @xmath2 cross section .",
    "the rapidity shift was taken into account to obtain the @xmath2 cross section in the rapidity ranges of the @xmath3pb measurement .",
    "the factor @xmath19 in the denominator of eq .  (",
    "[ eqn : rpa ] ) takes the centrality of the collision into account and is calculated in a glauber model @xcite . in this paper , we concentrate only on the minimum bias results .",

    "@xcite for a discussion of the centrality dependence of the @xmath5 measurement at rhic .",
    "work is in progress on the centrality dependence at the lhc @xcite .",
    "in addition to studying the nuclear modification factors in these rapidity ranges , the forward - backward ratio , @xmath20 has also been presented @xcite .",
    "the unmeasured quantities @xmath19 and @xmath21 cancel for a rapidity range symmetric around @xmath22 .",
    "therefore @xmath23 is formed in the rapidity region where the forward and backward acceptances completely overlap , @xmath24 for alice and @xmath25 for lhcb .",
    "some systematic uncertainties also cancel in the ratio .",
    "this ratio is perhaps a more faithful representation of cold matter effects on the @xmath3pb cross section .",
    "however , for theoretical interpretation , @xmath26 is still desirable because even a wrong model can produce the right ratio .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", predictions were made for @xmath27 collisions at @xmath28 and 5.5 tev and ratios were formed both to @xmath2 collisions at the same energy and to @xmath2 collisions at the anticipated top energy of @xmath29 tev .",
    "these calculations were made before the lhc turned on and so did not employ the same energies at which data were ultimately taken in lhc run i : @xmath30 , 7 and 8 tev for @xmath2 collisions and 5.02 tev for @xmath3pb .",
    "these calculations assumed that the leading and next - to - leading order treatments of the modifications of the parton densities in nuclei , when employed consistently , would be identical , as discussed in more detail later .",
    "more recently , calculations were made for the nuclear modification factor as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 at the energy appropriate for the @xmath3pb run @xcite but not taking the rapidity shift into account for the @xmath0 acceptance .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0 dependent ratio was presented for forward rapidity only .",
    "these predictions , along with other , updated , cem calculations with eps09 nlo nuclear parton densities ( npdfs ) were compared to the alice and lhcb @xmath5 and @xmath6 data @xcite .",
    "in those calculations , the incorrect factorization scale , @xmath31 , was passed to the nuclear parton densities .",
    "( the square of the scale was passed instead of the scale itself , as required by most shadowing parameterizations , so that the overall cold matter effect was reduced relative to the true value .",

    "[ sec : params ] to see if any parameterizations are particularly favored .",
    "the mass and scale dependence of the results is also shown .",
    "finally , we discuss how closely the @xmath33 calculations can be reproduced by a convolution of @xmath34 and @xmath35 collisions and also compare to the rhic data .",
    "in this section , we describe the quarkonium data for @xmath5 and @xmath36 from alice and lhcb .",
    "since there has been no @xmath2 run at @xmath37 tev to date , the denominator of @xmath26 has to be interpolated between available measurements at other energies .",
    "the @xmath2 cross sections also had to be adjusted to the rapidity ranges of the @xmath3pb measurement .",
    "the interpolation methods used by the collaborations depend on the quarkonium state , the observable , and the previously available data .",
    "however , in all cases , the quarkonium states were assumed to be produced unpolarized .    to obtain @xmath38 for the @xmath5 ,",
    "the alice collaboration used an energy interpolation between their @xmath2 measurements at 2.76 and 7 tev to obtain the @xmath39 dependence of the @xmath2 cross section .",
    "they presented their @xmath5 @xmath3pb data in both a single rapidity interval as well as in six rapidity bins measured for @xmath2 collisions ( of course without the rapidity shift in @xmath2 ) .",
    "these first results were for @xmath26 at forward and backward rapidity and @xmath23 as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "their energy interpolation was based on three assumed shapes : linear , power law and exponential .",
    "the central value of the result for each rapidity bin is an average of the three shapes while the uncertainty is the quadrature sum of a term related to the uncertainty on the data used for the interpolation and a term related to the spread between results with different shapes .",
    "an additional small systematic uncertainty was obtained by comparing the shapes with those of the leading order cem and the fixed - order next - to - leading logarithm ( fonll ) approach for inclusive open heavy flavor production @xcite .",
    "we note that the lo and nlo cem energy dependence should be similar if the same mass and scale parameters , as well as the same proton parton densities are used .",
    "( the shapes will not be similar if _",
    "e.g. _ cteq6 m is used at nlo and cteq61l is used at lo . )",
    "using the fonll calculation for the total @xmath40 cross section may produce a shape similar to the cem but the magnitude , of course , will be quite different .",
    "in a later paper , the alice collaboration presented results for the midrapidity @xmath26 , a bin around @xmath41 to add to @xmath38 as well as the ratios @xmath42 at forward , backward and midrapidity @xcite . while the forward - backward ratio as a function of @xmath0 was published in ref .",
    "@xcite , the separate values of @xmath42 were not yet available .",
    "the @xmath2 baseline for the @xmath0-dependent ratios was obtained through interpolation . at midrapidity ,",
    "data from @xmath43 , 1.96 , 2.76 and 7 tev were used .",
    "the 1.96 tev results from @xmath44 collisions from the tevatron were considered on the same basis as @xmath2 collisions because , at these high energies , production is dominated by the @xmath45 process . scaling in @xmath46",
    "was used to compare the disparate energies .",
    "only exponential , logarithmic and power law dependencies were considered in this case because there is no @xmath0 dependence in the lo cem and the fonll approach is for single inclusive distributions , not pairs , so the @xmath0 slope is not available from these calculations .    at forward rapidity , the only data available to include in the @xmath39 interpolation are the 2.76 and 7 tev data from alice .",
    "( they did not employ the lhcb results in their interpolation . ) in this region , the dependencies were linear , power law and exponential .",
    "the results for @xmath42 are only shown up to 8 gev because the @xmath2 data were limited to this @xmath0 range .",
    "the non - prompt @xmath5 production from @xmath47 decays increases with @xmath0 , giving a @xmath48% correction at @xmath49 gev @xcite .",
    "alice has also measured the @xmath50 in @xmath3pb collisions , finding significantly more suppression @xcite . since this difference can not be due to initial state effects alone",
    ", we do not address that result in this work .",
    "the alice collaboration also measured the inclusive @xmath6(1s ) and @xmath6(2s ) rates .",
    "the rapidity dependence of @xmath26 was reported in ref .",
    "the @xmath6 yields are not large so that only one rapidity bin is reported . to obtain the @xmath2 baseline for @xmath26",
    ", they used the lhcb results for @xmath6 production at @xmath30 , 7 and 8 tev , divided into rapidity bins .",
    "they employed 21 different shapes , 15 from the lo cem with different proton pdfs and factorization scale choices ; 3 based on the fonll @xmath47 quark distributions ; while linear , power - law , and exponential shapes rounded out the set .",
    "the agreement of all the shapes with the data was generally poor so the fits with the worst @xmath51/dof were discarded for the final fits . in addition to the @xmath5 uncertainties described above , they also considered small rapidity shifts between the alice and lhcb rapidity bins .",
    "they found that the @xmath6 @xmath26 is quite similar to that of @xmath5 at forward rapidity while at negative rapidity the @xmath6 @xmath26 is compatible with unity but lower than that of the @xmath5 .",
    "this is a fairly remarkable result since nuclear effects are generally expected to be smaller for the @xmath6 than for @xmath5 so that the @xmath6 @xmath26 should be closer to unity at low @xmath0 where the difference in mass is the dominant effect . at higher @xmath0 ,",
    "where @xmath52 , the results should be similar for the two quarkonium states .",
    "they reported the @xmath53 ratios at forward and backward rapidity , @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively @xcite .",
    "the result is consistent with the @xmath2 ratio at 7 tev .",
    "this is also consistent with shadowing being the dominant cold matter effect since it affects the excited states the same way as the ground state .",
    "the lhcb collaboration has also measured @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite production in their muon spectrometer .",
    "in addition to the inclusive @xmath5 result , they also separate @xmath56 decays to present a non - prompt @xmath5 result .",
    "their primary functional dependence to interpolate between their @xmath2 results at 2.76 , 7 and 8 tev is a power law , @xmath57 .",

    "they do not use any production models for the energy interpolation @xcite . a similar",
    ", power - law - based method is used to obtain the @xmath2 baseline for @xmath6 production @xcite .",
    "recently , the atlas collaboration has presented results on the forward - backward @xmath5 ratio as a function of @xmath1 in the region @xmath58 gev and as a function of rapidity in the rapidity range @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "their results for @xmath23 are consistent with unity within the uncertainties of the data .",
    "cms also recently presented the prompt @xmath5 @xmath23 as a function of @xmath0 and as a function of rapidity for high @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "finally , we note that we do not discuss the intriguing cms @xmath63 ratios measured as a function of both the number of tracks at midrapidity and the transverse energy at forward rapidity @xcite .",
    "this effect , also seen in @xmath2 collisions , is not attributable to initial - state modifications of the parton densities and , as such , is outside the scope of this work .",

    "<S> + we also investigate the size of the mass and scale uncertainties relative to the uncertainty on the shadowing parameterization . finally , we check whether the expected cold matter effect in nucleus - nucleus collisions can be modeled as the product of proton - nucleus results at forward and backward rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> + * results : * we find that the rapidity and @xmath0 dependence of the nuclear modification factor are generally consistent with the next - to - leading order calculations in the color evaporation model . </S>",
    "<S> the forward - backward ratio is more difficult to describe with shadowing alone . </S>",
    "<S> the leading and next - to - leading order calculations are inconsistent for eps09 while other available parameterizations are consistent . </S>",
    "<S> the mass and scale uncertainties on quarkonium production are larger than those of the nuclear parton densities . </S>",
    "<S> + * conclusions : * while shadowing is consistent with the nuclear suppression factors within the uncertainties , it is not consistent with the measured forward - backward asymmetry , especially as a function of transverse momentum . data from @xmath2 collisions at the same energy are needed . </S>"
