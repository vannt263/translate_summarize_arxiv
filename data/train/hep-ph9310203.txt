    "the lep collaborations now all have high - statistics data samples which enable them to make accurate measurements of a wide range of @xmath10 qcd observables [ 1 - 9 ] - jet fractions , thrust distributions , the hadronic width of the @xmath4 , energy - energy correlations , etc .. for most of these quantities non - perturbative effects such as hadronization corrections are expected to be reasonably small and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations are available in renormalization group ( rg ) improved qcd perturbation theory @xcite . for the hadronic width of the @xmath4 alone we have a next - nlo ( nnlo ) calculation available",
    "@xcite .    by comparing such calculations with the data one hopes to be able to extract @xmath11 , the fundamental su(3 ) standard model parameter , or equivalently @xmath12 , the @xmath13 scheme coupling constant .",
    "unfortunately this intention is hampered by our rather limited current knowledge of what qcd actually predicts for any of these quantities due to the dependence of perturbative calculations at nlo on the unphysical renormalization scale @xmath14 , and more generally on the renormalization scheme ( rs ) in higher - orders . in a complete all - orders calculation of any quantity",
    "the @xmath14-dependence would cancel and so it is an arbitary parameter , but our reliance on a truncated expansion in @xmath12 in which such a cancellation no longer quite occurs renders predictions ambiguous .",
    "since it was first clearly formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite this ` scheme dependence problem ' has been the subject of an extensive literature which has yet to produce consensus .",
    "the response of theorists to the dependence of nlo predictions on @xmath14 has mainly been to advocate - in the face of the central fact that it is actually an arbitrary unphysical quantity - that some particular choice of the scale is the ` correct ' or ` best ' one , thereby removing the ambiguity .",
    "any such choice must appeal to some criterion outside of the familiar , well - defined business of calculating feynman diagrams and no such appeal has so far been able to command universal support .",
    "confronted with such confusion amongst their colleagues , experimentalists have tended to adopt pragmatic compromises that ` mix and match ' different proposed solutions .",
    "specific reservations about the way this has been done at lep will be expressed in section 2 , but it is clear that any approach to the problem that increases consistency amongst observables by expanding error bars to include a ` theoretical uncertainty ' ( essentially obtained by averaging across camps of theorists ) does so by sacrificing unambiguous clarity over what is being measured , and limits the extent to which qcd could be investigated in detail .    in some sense ,",
    "all previously proposed approaches have been an attempt to second - guess the uncalculated higher - order terms in the perturbation series , in that they say this choice of scale and a nlo calculation will give a prediction _ as if _ we knew the full series - and it is likely to be a reasonable , perhaps good , prediction at that . on the other hand ,",
    "our position is essentially that the higher - order terms are simply unknown and that we therefore should restrict attention to the more modest aim of deciding what it is actually possible to learn about the uncalculated terms from the information at our disposal .",
    "a widespread belief already exists that the severity of the scale dependence for any particular observable is somehow related to the size of its corrections in higher - orders , although this overlooks the problem that the size of the unknown terms is itself a scheme dependent notion - there is after all always a scheme in which there are no corrections whatsoever . put another way , the total uncalculated corrections to a @xmath14-dependent nlo prediction must also depend on the scale so that their sum does not .",
    "superficially , we have therefore posed ourselves an unphysical ( and hence uninteresting ) question .",
    "however this @xmath14-dependence would only be a fundamental problem if it were unknown , unpredictable and uncontrollable , when in fact ( as we shall show ) the higher - orders can be split into a predictable contribution incorporating all the awkward @xmath14-dependence and a remaining piece containing all the genuinely unknown aspects .",
    "this is really just a consequence of the fact that the @xmath14-dependence in a nlo calculation has a universal form , and so a minimal version of our claim would be that we are suggesting a simple , convenient means of comparing theory and data in which the scale dependence is trivial .",
    "the formalism to be proposed has the advantages of being derived non - perturbatively and as far as possible entirely in terms of rs - invariant quantities .",
    "in particular , @xmath15 is avoided in favour of @xmath16 , the dimensional transmutation parameter of qcd , as the free parameter in the theory since the former is just a theoretical construct without any direct experimental significance and is indeed strictly a different quantity in nnlo from what it was in nlo .",
    "it remains true that @xmath17 is rs - dependent , but with the difference that the values in different schemes are exactly related by only a nlo calculation .",
    "this @xmath17 is to be as directly related as possible to @xmath18 , any generic lep observable dependent on a single dimensionful scale @xmath19 ( i.e. @xmath20 , the @xmath21 centre of mass energy ) . because this @xmath18 will play a role analogous to @xmath15",
    ", we shall refer to this approach as the ` effective charge formalism ' ; it was originally introduced by grunberg @xcite and has also been discussed by dhar and gupta @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there has been a widespread view that grunberg s approach constitutes no more than a particular choice of rs . indeed the insistence on using the rs - invariant @xmath18 rather than the rs - dependent @xmath15 in the role of coupling means that the formalism has much in common with the fastest apparent convergence ( fac ) criterion for choosing the scheme , by which the rs is chosen such that the higher corrections vanish .",
    "this perturbative property is a nice one , often simplifying calculations , but in this paper it is entirely secondary to the clarifying benefits of non - perturbatively identifying each observable as a coupling ( from which it follows trivially ) .",
    "we can not overemphasize that the effective charge ( ec ) formalism is both derived non - perturbatively and is more general than the adoption of a particular scheme , even if pieces of that formalism can be interpreted in terms of the fac scheme .    because it should provide a way of measuring @xmath17 without any scale ambiguity whatsoever , thereby saving the formalism from merely being a useful framework for displaying data , as important an interpretation of the formalism derives from the way in which @xmath18 runs as a renormalisation group improved coupling with @xmath19 .",
    "this evolution is described by a function @xmath22 which is simultaneously both the basis for a convenient rs - invariant measure of the importance of the higher - orders and the @xmath23-function corresponding to the fac scheme .",
    "thus the effective charge @xmath23-function @xmath22 can , at least in principle , be experimentally measured , so that by detailed investigations of the running of @xmath18 with @xmath19 one can determine @xmath24 even in the absence of nnlo perturbative calculations .",
    "the formalism applied in this way is non - perturbative and transcends the use of any particular scheme , with the only barrier to an accurate determination of @xmath24 being the purely experimental uncertainty .",
    "of course at present we do not have high precision information on the running of these lep observables , and the running can only be investigated using data obtained at lower energies with different detectors and machines . in an ideal world lep",
    "would take data at energies below @xmath25 and study the running of the observables in detail .",
    "as we shall argue , this would enable reasonably precise determinations of @xmath3 , and more importantly would also indicate whether nnlo corrections by themselves would be sufficient , helping to establish whether the extremely arduous calculations involved are worth embarking on @xcite .    even in the absence of information on nnlo corrections and the detailed running of the observables with energy ,",
    "however , there is still information to be obtained with the effective charge formalism , given only nlo calculations .",
    "one can exhibit the relative size of the uncalculated higher - order corrections for different quantities . in the effective charge language",
    "these are related to how the energy dependence of the quantity at the experimental energy differs from its asymptotic dependence as @xmath26 .",
    "if this difference can not be neglected , then nnlo calculations or measurements of the running are necessary before @xmath6 can be determined .",
    "this can be decided in the effective charge formalism given only a nlo calculation and data at one energy .",
    "our proposal is thus not a solution to the scheme dependence problem in the conventional sense . for a start ,",
    "sufficiently much can be learnt about qcd independently of the absolute value of @xmath24 for the problem itself to be something of a distraction ; refining the experimental data on the relative size of higher - order corrections for different observables and providing explanations for the aberrant ones is a serious challange in its own right .",
    "furthermore , the energy - dependence data already allows us to make tentative absolute statements in a way complementary to perturbation theory .",
    "the scale dependence problem is not so much solved as completely outflanked .",
    "a preliminary discussion of the effective charge formalism applied in this way has appeared in references [ 17 ] and [ 18 ] .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we shall review the rs dependence problem and outline the traditional approach to @xmath12 extraction . in section 3",
    "we shall introduce in detail the effective charge formalism sketched above and stress its advantages over the conventional approach .",
    "we shall attempt to determine @xmath3 using the rather limited information on nnlo corrections and energy dependence of observables currently available .",
    "we shall also discuss an attempt to resum higher - order terms in the effective charge beta - function using the knowledge of leading and next - to - leading logarithms in the jet resolution variable @xmath27 for jet rates in the @xmath28 or durham algorithm @xcite , where the perturbation series has an exponentiated structure @xcite .",
    "such a next - to - leading logarithm ( nll ) resummation of the effective charge @xmath23-function is without ambiguity , and in the effective charge language the @xmath27 dependence can be extracted from the experimental measurements and compared with that of the resummed @xmath23-function , indicating whether or not the nll approximation is adequate .",
    "recent attempts to compare resummed perturbation series with the lep data require use of an ad hoc matching procedure @xcite to include the exact nlo results , the additional problem of scale dependence still remaining .",
    "in section 4 we give our conclusions .",
    "consider a generic dimensionless lep observable @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the single dimensionful scale on which it depends , typically the @xmath10 centre of mass energy @xmath29 . in rg",
    "improved perturbation theory we can write without loss of generality , @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the rg improved coupling @xmath32 .",
    "notice that by dividing any observable depending only on a single dimensionful scale by its possibly dimensionful tree - level perturbative coefficient ( which will be rs invariant ) , and raising to a suitable power , we can always obtain a series of the form representing a dimensionless @xmath18 .",
    "the coupling @xmath31 and series coefficients @xmath33 depend on the rs employed . using the compact notation and conventions introduced by stevenson @xcite @xmath31",
    "is specified by a @xmath23-function equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 , with @xmath14 the renormalisation scale and @xmath6 the dimensional transmutation mass parameter of qcd , here differing from the traditional definition by a factor @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are rs invariants dependent only on the number of quark flavours @xmath39 and the number of colours @xmath40 ; for @xmath41 we have @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in all our lep determinations",
    "we take @xmath44 and assume massless quarks .",
    "for massive quarks the scheme dependence discussion will also go through in any mass - independent rs , i.e. one in which the coefficients @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xmath47 do not depend on the fermion masses @xcite .",
    "the higher coefficients @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath47 are rs - dependent . indeed stevenson @xcite , extending the work of stueckelberg and petermann @xcite , has shown that one may consistently use the parameters @xmath50 to label the renormalization scheme . in the conventional approach when retaining terms up to and including @xmath51 in equation one truncates the @xmath23-function of equation retaining terms up to and including @xmath52 . on integrating up the truncated equation one can define @xmath53 and correspondingly one finds for consistency @xmath54,@xmath55,@xmath56 , @xmath47,@xmath57 . in this way",
    "the @xmath58-order truncated approximant is also labelled by the scheme variables , @xmath59 . of course when summed to all orders this dependence must cancel and a formally rs - independent sum be obtained .",
    "the formal consistency of perturbation theory further ensures that @xmath60 so that differences between results in two different rs s are formally effects one order higher in perturbation theory .",
    "of course @xmath61 depends on @xmath62 and @xmath63 and may well not be a small coefficient .    before discussing the general situation",
    "further let us consider the simplest @xmath64 , nlo case .",
    "this is the accuracy to which all but one of the lep observables have been calculated .    to nlo",
    "we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 is obtained by integrating up the nlo truncation of equation @xmath67 with the boundary condition @xmath68 one obtains @xmath69 where we define the function @xmath70 for later use , so that @xmath71 .    how does @xmath72",
    "depend on @xmath73 explicitly ? to see this , consider two different rs s , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the connection between the corresponding renormalised couplings @xmath31 and @xmath76 will then be such that @xmath77 and we can define @xmath78 inserting into the series for @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the two rs s and equating coefficients one finds @xmath81 by integrating up @xmath82 and @xmath83 as in and taking the difference we find @xmath84 where the @xmath85 and @xmath86 terms reflect contributions beyond nlo in the @xmath23-functions . using equation and equating coefficients of corresponding powers of @xmath31",
    "gives @xmath87 eliminating @xmath88 between equations and we finally arrive at @xmath89 this implies that @xmath90    it is useful to identify the rs - invariant combination @xcite @xmath91 since @xmath18 is a function of a single dimensionful scale @xmath19 it follows that @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 rs - invariants .",
    "@xmath94 is dependent only on the particular qcd observable @xmath95 .",
    "this strongly suggests that these quantities should have a _ physical _ significance as opposed to rs - dependent quantities such as @xmath54 and @xmath96 which depend on unphysical parameters .",
    "as we shall show in section 3 this is indeed the case , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are connected with the asymptotic ( @xmath26 ) dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath19 with @xmath97 and so @xmath93 , or equivalently @xmath94 could in principle be directly measured given unlimited experimental energies .",
    "this observable - dependent ` physical ' quantity @xmath94 is directly connected to @xmath98 the universal dimensional transmutation parameter of qcd which we are attempting to determine . to see this , recall that @xmath99 is the variable which specifies the rs in nlo .",
    "notice it is _ not _ sufficient to specify that one has chosen a given renormalisation scale @xmath14 in order to specify the rs even at nlo .",
    "the renormalisation scheme is specified by @xmath73 which involves @xmath98 as well .    since @xmath93 is an invariant we see that for two different rs s , @xmath74 and @xmath100 @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the nlo correction evaluated in the renormalisation scheme @xmath74 and @xmath103 with @xmath104 . from equation with @xmath105",
    "we find directly that @xmath106 and so given a nlo calculation in some rs the invariant @xmath94 is exactly related to the dimensional transmutation parameter @xmath98 .",

    "the implication of this important result @xcite is that it does not matter which @xmath98 we choose to try to extract from the data .",
    "if the rs is mass - independent then @xmath98 will be universal and can be exactly related to @xmath109 in any other scheme by a universal factor given exactly if we have a nlo calculation for any observable in both rs s .",
    "thus there is no non - trivial residual scheme dependence implied in our convenient choice of @xmath3 as the fundamental parameter we wish to extract .",
    "as an illustration consider the minimal subtraction ( @xmath110 ) renormalisation procedure and the @xmath13 or modified minimal subtraction procedure where the @xmath111 terms present in dimensional regularization are subtracted off @xmath112 is euler s constant ) . for any observable , and independent of @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath113 so using equation we have @xmath114 this relation is independent of @xmath39 or @xmath40 . for the @xmath110 and @xmath13 procedures the higher order rs - dependent @xmath23-function coefficients are identical , @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the only difference is in the subtraction procedure and hence in the definition of the renormalisation scale @xmath14 .",
    "a choice of scale @xmath14 using the @xmath110 procedure corresponds , therefore , to the _ same _ renormalization scheme as use of the @xmath13 procedure with scale @xmath117 .",
    "we are finally in a position to exhibit the explicit dependence of @xmath118 on @xmath73 .",
    "in fact it is easier to equivalently consider the dependence on @xmath66 . using equation to write @xmath54 in terms of @xmath119 and @xmath73 , and using for @xmath66 in terms of @xmath73 we find @xmath120 when plotted versus @xmath96",

    "this provides a second @xmath220 value .",
    "the quoted central value of @xmath220 is then taken to lie mid - way between these extremes ( perhaps modified by hadronization ) and the difference between them is taken as indicative of the size of the uncalculated higher - order corrections . by enlarging the ` scheme dependence error ' in this way one obtains greater apparent consistency between different observables as shown in figure 2(b ) .",
    "in our view one learns nothing useful from an analysis of this kind .",
    "consider figure 2(a ) and the considerable scatter of @xmath12 values obtained from different observables fitted with @xmath219 .",
    "choosing @xmath219 means that from the higher - order coefficients are given by @xmath221 where the @xmath203 depend on the invariants @xmath222 and on the nnlo and higher rs parameters @xmath150 .",
    "we have tabulated in table 1 the @xmath223 values for some of the observables at particular values of the kinematical parameters using the nlo matrix elements of reference 10 .",
    "( for more details see section 3b ) .",
    "one sees that they are large and rather scattered , e.g for the jet rates @xmath224 which results in rather small ec ( or pms ) scales , @xmath225 .",
    "as emphasized earlier no physical significance attaches to these small scales , since the scale itself is just an artifact of the unphysical subtraction procedure employed .",
    "thus from one may expect large and rather scattered higher order corrections for the different observables with @xmath219 , which translates itself into the expectation of scattered values of @xmath220 , which indeed are observed .",
    "if we instead choose @xmath226 ( the effective charge scale ) for each observable then the higher order coefficients are given by @xmath227 where @xmath228 does not depend on the nlo rs choice ( @xmath73 ) , only on the nnlo and higher rs parameters and the rs - invariants @xmath141 .",
    "any scatter now observed in the extracted @xmath3 or @xmath220 for different observables will be attributable to these nnlo and higher rs invariants being large , and not to the scatter due to the nlo scheme dependence logarithms involving @xmath223 , which are avoided by the choice @xmath229 . as we shall discuss in section 3",
    "there is still scatter when this is done but it is somewhat reduced .    with the choice @xmath219 predictable scatter due to _ avoidable _",
    "already known nlo scheme dependence logarithms is superimposed on top of the interesting scatter due to the size of the nnlo and higher invariants which is telling us about nnlo and higher order uncalculated corrections .",
    "the choice @xmath229 removes the predictable scatter and provides genuine information on the interesting nnlo and higher - order uncalculated corrections .",
    "the @xmath13 scales obtained by fitting to the data for an observable over some range of the associated kinematical parameters tend to be considerably smaller than @xmath230 , as for the ec or pms scale . typically for values of the kinematical variable @xmath213 well away from the 2-jet region where large logarithms will be important",
    ", @xmath215 and @xmath231 do not vary strongly with @xmath213 .",
    "this means that one can not obtain best fits over such a range of @xmath213 .",
    "it is only by including the 2-jet region that one can obtain stable best fits , but then fitting for a @xmath213-independent scale over a range where @xmath215 and @xmath231 ( and presumably uncalculated higher order corrections ) are strongly @xmath213-dependent represents a rather severe compromise , and it is not obvious what one learns .    in conclusion , we believe that the standard nlo analyses used to extract @xmath12 from lep data do not serve to disentangle the genuinely new and interesting nnlo and higher order uncalculated corrections from predictable higher order corrections connected with the choice of rs at nlo .",
    "the resulting quoted values of @xmath220 ( or @xmath3 ) with attendant scheme dependence uncertainties therefore reflect the ad hoc way in which they were extracted , rather than the actual values of these parameters .",
    "in contrast , by choosing the effective charge scale for each observable one exposes the relative importance of uncalculated nnlo and higher corrections . an effective charge formalism which can be supplemented with non - perturbative information",
    "is described in the next section .",
    "* a. the @xmath19 dependence of @xmath18 *    for the dimensionless qcd observable @xmath18 we can define @xmath232 @xmath233 and hence @xmath234 are , at least in principle , experimentally observable quantities , although collider experiments are usually designed to make high - statistics observations at a fixed energy @xmath19 rather than examining the detailed running of observables with energy . to make contact with the standard perturbative approach we note that is the @xmath23-function equation in the effective charge scheme where the coupling @xmath235 and the @xmath23-function is @xmath22 as defined in equation .",
    "so we have @xmath236 the effective charge @xmath23-function @xmath22 may be regarded as a physical observable .",
    "as measured from data it will include a resummed version of the ( perhaps asymptotic ) formal perturbative series exhibited in together with the non - perturbative terms involving @xmath237 which are invisible in perturbation theory .",
    "( here s,@xmath238,@xmath239,@xmath240,  are observable - dependent constants which we shall not specify further @xcite . ) hence by comparing with data one can test how well the first few terms of the perturbative series serve to represent the observed running of @xmath18 . that is , from measurements of @xmath241 and @xmath242",
    ", one can test the extent to which @xmath243 describes the data . a marked discrepancy",
    "would either indicate the importance of the nnlo invariant @xmath244 and higher terms , or the relative importance of the non - perturbative contributions , or both .    given a collider program dedicated to the investigation of the @xmath19-dependence of observables",
    "the above tests would indeed be powerful and useful . the focus of present studies , however , is the accurate measurement of @xmath95 at fixed @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath245 , and the comparison of these results with nlo matrix element calculations in order to extract @xmath3 . to obtain @xmath18 we clearly need to integrate equation",
    "the boundary condition will be the assumption of asymptotic freedom , that is @xmath246 as @xmath247 , which corresponds to the requirement that @xmath248 for @xmath249 , with @xmath250 some suitably low energy .",
    "( equivalently , @xmath251 for @xmath249 , assuming @xmath252 or @xmath253 for @xmath254 qcd . )",
    "any zero of @xmath234 , @xmath255 , say , would correspond to @xmath256 as @xmath257 and ultraviolet fixed point behaviour .    integrating equation",
    "we obtain @xmath258 where @xmath94 is a finite constant which depends on the way the infinite constant is chosen .",
    "the infinite constant can be chosen to be @xmath259 where @xmath260 is _ any _ function which has the same @xmath261 behaviour as @xmath262 .",
    "we know from equation that @xmath262 has the universal @xmath263 behaviour @xmath264 so we choose @xmath265 .",
    "inserting this choice for @xmath260 and rearranging equation we find @xmath266.\\ ] ] the first integral on the right - hand side is just @xmath267 where @xmath70 is the function defined in equation ( 2.6 ) , @xmath268.\\ ] ]    we define for later convenience @xmath269.\\ ] ] notice that despite appearances the integrand of @xmath270 is regular at @xmath271 .",
    "then we have @xmath272 as @xmath257 , @xmath246 so that @xmath273 and thus asymptotically @xmath274 with the constant of integration given by @xmath275 notice that in arriving at ( 3.9 ) we did not need to refer to perturbation theory , except to assume the asymptotic @xmath263 @xmath276 behaviour @xmath277 . despite this",
    ", the constant @xmath94 obtained with the particular choice @xmath265 is precisely the @xmath94 introduced in equation .",
    "that is @xmath278 we can see this immediately since if @xmath31 denotes the coupling in the rs with @xmath279 using the @xmath13 subtraction procedure in nlo , and with higher order @xmath23-function coefficients zero @xcite we have @xmath280 giving a well - defined all - orders coupling .",
    "further @xmath281 @xmath282 as @xmath257 , so asymptotically as @xmath283 we have @xmath284 where the ellipsis denotes terms which vanish as @xmath247 . inserting into and using we find as @xmath257 .",
    "so finally we have @xmath285 we could , of course , have written down the result of equation perturbatively in the ec scheme at once by simply using the integrated beta - function equation of equation ( 2.24 ) with @xmath286 , @xmath287 , and @xmath185 .",
    "however , our purpose here has been to stress that equation holds _ beyond perturbation theory _ for the measured observable @xmath18 and @xmath288 constructed from the measured running of @xmath18 , @xmath289 .",
    "that is , we can write a _ non - perturbative _ closed expression _ exactly _ relating the universal constant @xmath3 to observable quantites .",
    "since @xmath290 involves an integral in @xmath18 between @xmath291 and 0 , to actually measure it would require knowlege of @xmath18 ( equivalently @xmath233 ) on the full range @xmath292 .",
    "we of course only know @xmath18 on some finite energy range , so if we want to obtain @xmath3 from equation and measurements of @xmath18 there will always be an uncertainty related to our lack of knowledge about the behaviour of @xmath18 beyond the highest energy reached , or correspondingly related to our lack of knowledge about @xmath22 for @xmath293 , with @xmath250 the highest energy reached .",
    "as we shall discuss in sub - section 3c we can use measurements of the running of @xmath18 to determine @xmath22 in the vicinity of @xmath294 , and perturbative qcd calculations to determine @xmath22 in the vicinity of @xmath295 .",
    "putting these two pieces of information together we can make unambiguous statements about the validity of perturbation theory and the nature of the function @xmath22 , which can assist our attempts to determine @xmath3 .",
    "notice the fundamental significance of the nlo perturbative coefficient @xmath152 in all of this .",
    "knowledge of the full behaviour of @xmath18 at large @xmath19 would allow one to extract @xmath94 from equation , but this by itself is _ observable - dependent _ and so one would not test qcd .",
    "a test is only possible if one also knows @xmath152 ( from feynman diagram calculations ) and can then obtain the _ universal _ @xmath3 from equation .",
    "the universal @xmath3 of course depends on the number of active quark flavours , @xmath296 ; the rs invariants @xmath37 and @xmath38 occurring in equation also involve @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath3 in equation involves the @xmath283 behaviour of @xmath18 , one might wonder what value for @xmath39 should be taken . with three generations of quarks , @xmath297 presumably represents the asymptotic number of active flavours and so , introducing the notation @xmath298 , @xmath299 , the function @xmath260 in equation should be chosen as @xmath300 .",
    "so finally with the explicit @xmath39 dependence exhibited becomes @xmath301 \\right\\ }   \\\\ & = & b(6)\\ln \\frac{q}{\\tilde{\\lambda}^{(6)}_{\\overline{ms } } } - r_{1}^{\\overline{ms}}(q , n_{f}=6 ) - \\int_{0}^{r(q ) } dx \\left [ \\frac{b(6)}{\\xi(x ) } + \\frac{1}{x^{2}(1+c(6)x ) } \\right].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously the strict asymptotic @xmath257 behaviour of @xmath18 and @xmath302 is an idealized concept since we could never actually measure it .",
    "for instance , it presumably makes no sense to consider qcd in isolation beyond the gut energy scale . rather than using for lep observables where we have @xmath163 active flavours , it makes more sense to consider the equation for @xmath18 in a world with @xmath163 active flavours , replacing @xmath303 , @xmath304 , and @xmath305 in by @xmath306 , @xmath307 , and @xmath308 .",
    "the decoupling theorem @xcite means that we can consider an @xmath163 version of qcd for energies below top threshold . as we shall discuss",
    "we shall be interested in how the observed @xmath19-evolution of @xmath18 at lep energies compares with its asymptotic @xmath257 evolution in a _",
    "hypothetical _ world with @xmath163 flavours .",
    "this will decide how accurately we can determine the universal constant @xmath308 . to have any chance of determining @xmath305 we would require measurements around the top threshold and at higher energies , which we do not currently possess .    a further subtlety connected with the effective charge formalism concerns the fact that one can always define effective charges other than @xmath309 .",
    "more generally one could define @xmath310 where @xmath311 is any analytic function of @xmath31 .",
    "chla has suggested that this arbitrariness is just the scheme dependence problem in disguise @xcite . in our view",
    "this is incorrect ( see also grunberg s response @xcite ) .",
    "in fact the arbitrariness in defining the effective charge is completely equivalent to redefining the observable to be @xmath312 , maintaining the standard definition of effective charge @xmath313 .",
    "one can of course always consider @xmath314 as the measured observable rather than @xmath95 , and then nlo truncation of the perturbation series for @xmath314 using some rs will give different results from those obtained with @xmath95 .",
    "such a redefinition of the observable would only be useful if some information on the uncalculated higher order corrections , i.e. knowledge of the function @xmath22 , were available to inform the choice .",
    "let us suppose that we have measurements for a number of lep observables at a fixed energy ( @xmath245 ) , and knowledge of their nlo qcd perturbative corrections @xmath152 .",
    "what can we learn ?",
    "recall from equation that @xmath315 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath152 are evaluated with @xmath163 . as @xmath257 , @xmath316 and @xmath317 at sufficiently large @xmath19 , @xmath318 and may be used to obtain @xmath308 .",
    "we have that @xmath319.\\ ] ]    given only a nlo perturbative calculation we have no information on @xmath320 . from the measured observable @xmath321 and the nlo perturbative coefficient",
    "we can then extract @xmath322.\\ ] ] to relate this to the discussions of section 2 , the quantity on the left of equation is just the value of @xmath3 which would be extracted from the data at nlo choosing @xmath323 , the effective charge scale . if @xmath324 , then this nlo estimate will be accurate .",
    "indeed the fractional error in @xmath3 will be @xmath325 the size of @xmath326 will depend on the qcd observable .",
    "if the @xmath308 values obtained from equation exhibit significant scatter , then this indicates that @xmath320 is not negligible for at least some of the observables .",
    "recall that @xmath320 is defined non - perturbatively in terms of the running of @xmath18 by equation ( 3.8 ) where @xmath327 . if @xmath19 is sufficiently large that @xmath233 has its asymptotic ( @xmath257 ) @xmath19-dependence , that is if @xmath328 , then @xmath329 .",
    "thus significant scatter in the @xmath308 extracted at nlo with the effective charge scale unambiguously indicates that the current experimental @xmath19 is not yet large enough for all observables to be evolving with @xmath19 asymptotically . if we want to reliably determine @xmath308 additional information on the ` sub - asymptotic ' effects is required .",
    "the presence of these effects is a physical fact which can be directly observed from the @xmath19-dependence of data , and can not be remedied by changing the unphysical renormalization scheme .",
    "we stress once again how different this is from the scatter obtained with @xmath219 which will be partly due to different values of @xmath223 and hence which can be modified by changing the unphysical subtraction procedure .    to make this distinction more precise , let us define @xmath330 to be the @xmath308 value extracted at nlo using an rs with @xmath331 .",
    "the nlo coefficient @xmath332 may be taken to label the rs at nlo . using @xmath31 to denote the coupling constant in this rs we have @xmath333 and @xmath334 then using equations ( 3.20),(3.23 ) , and ( 3.24 ) it is straightforward to show that @xmath335\\tilde{\\lambda}^{(5)}_{\\overline{ms } } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\exp(\\delta f(r_{1},r)/b ) \\tilde{\\lambda}(nlo,0 ) , \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath336 @xmath337 @xmath338 is just the @xmath308 extracted choosing @xmath229 ( @xmath339 ) , given by equation ( 3.21 ) .    from equation ( 3.25 )",
    "we see that the nlo scatter in @xmath308 is factorized into two components .",
    "the first is an _ already known _",
    "@xmath332-dependent contribution involving @xmath340 which may be obtained exactly from ( 3.26 ) with @xmath190 , and does _ not _ involve the unknown nnlo and higher rs invariants .",
    "the second component , @xmath341 , does not depend on @xmath332 but does involve the unknown higher invariants , and represents the irreducible uncertainty in determining @xmath3 at nlo .",
    "the uninformative @xmath332-dependent part of the scatter can therefore be completely removed by choosing @xmath229 , which sets @xmath342 .",
    "the scatter is then completely given by @xmath270 .",
    "rather than focusing on the scatter in @xmath3 , we prefer for presentational reasons to concentrate on the relative size of @xmath270 .",
    "we can define for each observable @xmath343 given a nlo perturbative calculation of @xmath152 and experimental measurements of @xmath321 we can then measure @xmath344 from the data up to @xmath345 which should be a universal constant .",
    "changing @xmath24 merely translates the @xmath270 obtained up or down by the _ same amount _ for each observable , so we can choose an arbitrary reference value for @xmath308 .",
    "for two different observables @xmath346 and @xmath347 , the difference @xmath348 can then be measured absolutely and so the _ relative _ size of @xmath270 may be investigated .",
    "if @xmath349 for each observable , corresponding to small sub - asymptotic effects , then the @xmath350 points should lie on a horizontal straight line with some small scatter .",
    "substantial deviations from a horizontal straight line therefore unambiguously indicate the presence of sizeable sub - asymptotic effects .",
    "the scatter in @xmath350 is of course entirely equivalent to the scatter in the @xmath308 extracted at nlo with @xmath351 , these correspond to the reference @xmath308 values for which @xmath352 .",
    "we shall return to these @xmath308 values later .    if one has a nnlo perturbative calculation or measurement of @xmath321 at more than one energy then , as we shall discuss in the next subsection , one can attempt to estimate @xmath270 directly .",
    "one can then see if for all observables a single value of @xmath308 brings @xmath350 into agreement with the directly estimated @xmath270 .",

    "we used published opal data @xcite without correcting for hadronization effects .",
    "these are expected to be totally negligible for @xmath380 , but will be important in the small @xmath27 region . for thrust and eec the @xmath350 distributions are flat away from @xmath381 and @xmath382 where large corrections involving @xmath383 and @xmath384 respectively will be important .",
    "returning to figure 3 we see that there is significant scatter , in particular between the jet rates with e0 and d recombination algorithms . to proceed further",

    "we shall attempt to use this data together with the lep data for these quantities to obtain absolute estimates of @xmath270 from the @xmath19-dependence .",
    "we conclude by tabulating in table 2 the @xmath308 values obtained by fitting to lep data at nlo for these same observables at the same values of the kinematical parameters as in table 1 using @xmath386 and @xmath351 .",
    "the @xmath351 values correspond to the @xmath308 values for which @xmath387 , and so the scatter is directly related to points in the @xmath270 plot of figure 3 .",
    "the @xmath219 values show much greater scatter , since as discussed in section 2 the scatter in @xmath223 is superimposed on top of the physically - relevant scatter in @xmath270 .    to further emphasise this , suppose that we lived in an ` asymptotic world ' where @xmath245 was sufficiently large that @xmath388 for all observables .",

    "the apparent running has been compared with the nlo qcd expectations for various choices of renormalization scale @xmath14 , and @xmath6 .",
    "it has even been suggested @xcite that the lep measurements may indicate slightly less running than is expected from qcd , and that light gluinos , which would modify the qcd @xmath23-function , can not be excluded .",

    "there has been much recent interest , both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite , in the possibility of resumming leading and next - to - leading logarithms ( nll ) in kinematical variables to all - orders for lep observables . by identifying the leading and next - to - leading logarithms in the perturbative coefficients @xmath459 , with @xmath460 ( where @xmath213 is @xmath461 ) , and by demonstrating generalised exponentiation one can resum these terms to all - orders . to include the exact nlo perturbative coefficient , however , some ad hoc matching prescription is then required @xcite , and anyway the problem of renormalization scale dependence still remains .",
    "the advantage of the ec formalism here is that from the leading and next - to - leading logarithms in @xmath462 one can obtain the leading and next - to - leading logarithms in the rs invariants @xmath463 .",

    "we retain @xmath38 in @xmath82 so that @xmath477 . from ( 3.39 ) and ( 3.40 ) one has @xmath478 then using ( 3.41 ) one finds @xmath479 where @xmath480 if one then inserts @xmath465 of ( 3.43 ) into ( 3.36 ) and change variables from @xmath417 to @xmath481 performing the integration one finds @xmath482    in figure 10(a ) the diamond points show the absolute prediction for @xmath467 versus @xmath483 obtained using ( 3.46 ) together with the opal data of reference @xcite for @xmath376 uncorrected for hadronization effects .",
    "the other points show the corresponding @xmath350 ( see figure 5 ) with the reference value of @xmath308 adjusted so that @xmath350 agrees with @xmath467 at the peak in @xmath467 .",
    "notice that for @xmath484 the nll prediction has a completely different low-@xmath27 behaviour from the uncorrected data . in figure 10(b )",
    "the same quantites using hadronization - corrected opal data for @xmath376 @xcite are displayed .",
    "evidently , the low @xmath27 behaviour is now at least in qualitative agreement .",
    "we conclude that in order to test the adequacy of the nll approximation we are having to compare with data in a region where hadronization corrections are sizeable . unless one is extremely confident in one s ability to estimate these corrections it is hard to draw firm conclusions .",
    "evidently if one has a nlo perturbative qcd calculation available there will be some uncertainty in the nlo perturbative prediction for a qcd observable due to the missing uncalculated higher - order terms in the perturbation series .",
    "this has the effect that when one compares the nlo calculation with experimental data one may anticipate that the value of @xmath3 extracted will not be universal but will exhibit some scatter for different observables due to the differing sizes of the uncalculated contributions .",
    "the problem is compounded by the fact that the @xmath3 extracted depends also on the choice of rs at nlo , which may be labelled by @xmath332 the nlo coefficient ( or equivalently the renormalisation scale @xmath14 ) , an unphysical parameter .",
    "we have shown in equation ( 3.25 ) that the relation between the extracted @xmath330 and the actual @xmath3 which one is trying to measure is factorized into two contributions .",
    "one , @xmath340 , is @xmath332-dependent and known exactly from equation ( 3.26 ) , and the other , @xmath270 , is unknown but @xmath332-independent .",
    "@xmath344 depends only on the observable and nnlo and higher rs - invariants @xmath141 .",
    "the predictable @xmath332-dependence of @xmath330 therefore has nothing to tell us about the importance of uncalculated corrections , the irreducible uncertainty resides in the unknown @xmath270 .",
    "some of the @xmath332-dependent logarithms in the nnlo and higher corrections can be summed up into @xmath340 and the remainder can be absorbed into rs - invariant combinations contained in @xmath270 .",
    "the unknown @xmath270 can be isolated by choosing the particular rs where @xmath339 , @xmath229 the effective charge scale , which sets @xmath342 . from the scatter in @xmath338 for different observables one",
    "can then infer the scatter in @xmath270 , in particular relative differences @xmath485 for observables a , b can be absolutely measured .",
    "figure 3 indicates that these relative differences can not be neglected for a range of lep observables . for at least some of the observables @xmath270 must be sizeable , and so @xmath270 must be estimated before we can determine @xmath3 with any reliability .",
    "in contrast , in the standard lep determinations of @xmath1 one tries to estimate the importance of uncalculated higher - order corrections by using two different ad hoc scale choices and interpreting the spread in extracted @xmath1 as indicating a ` theoretical error ' . by artificially enlarging uncertainties in this way one obtains a spurious consistency between different observables , the real scale - independent uncertainty due to @xmath270 being buried beneath the supposedly informative scale dependence of @xmath486 .",
    "the global @xmath1 determinations obtained with these sort of analyses should therefore be treated with some scepticism .    having determined that @xmath270 is not negligible one must try to estimate it to make further progress . within the effective charge formalism",
    "one can write @xmath3 in terms of the measured observable @xmath18 , @xmath487 and @xmath270 constructed non - perturbatively from the measured running @xmath488 .",
    "@xmath270 may also be obtained perturbatively by expanding the effective charge @xmath23-function , so that given a nnlo calculation one can estimate @xmath489 . by combining nnlo calculations and @xmath19-dependence measurements one can refine ones knowledge of @xmath344 and hence of @xmath3 .",
    "the perturbative rs - invariants @xmath490 are connected with @xmath257 evolution of the observable @xmath18 , and hence provide information about the function @xmath22 in the vicinity of @xmath295 .",
    "the present situation is that a nnlo calculation is available only for the hadronic width of the @xmath4 . by estimating @xmath491 for this observable , and combining petra data for jet rates and energy - energy correlations , with lep data on these observables , to obtain an estimate of @xmath270 from @xmath19-dependence , we found consistency for @xmath8 mev .",
    "we also showed that for observables where leading and next - to - leading logarithms in kinematical variables can be resummed one can unambiguously estimate @xmath467 by resumming leading and next - to - leading logarithms in the rs invariants @xmath472 . in the conventional approach",
    "one needs to use an ad hoc matching procedure to include the exact nlo perturbative coefficient , and the problem of scale dependence still remains . performing this analysis for @xmath376 we found qualitative agreement between the @xmath27-dependence at low @xmath27 of @xmath467 and @xmath350 using",
    "hadronization corrected data , but a completely opposite low @xmath27 dependence using uncorrected data .",
    "we conclude that reliable measurements of @xmath3 at @xmath10 machines will require at least nnlo perturbative calculations and/or measurements of observables at more than one energy . acquiring",
    "such information will entail considerable experimental and theoretical effort .",
    "the effective charge formalism allows one to efficiently harness this hard won information to refine one s knowledge of @xmath3 and the interplay between perturbative and non - perturbative effects .",
    "the insistance on formulating everything in terms of physical quantities allows one to quantify uncertainties in a way which is impossible in approaches which choose the unphysical rs - dependence parameters according to some plausiblity argument .",
    "an important remaining problem is to extend the approach to processes with initial state hadrons where there is an additional factorization ambiguity connected with the separation of structure functions from the hard cross - sections .",
