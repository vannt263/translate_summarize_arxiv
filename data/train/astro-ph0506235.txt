    "the 2k@xmath02k camera s fov . is 50 @xmath050 arcmin and the limited magnitudes are 22.0 mag , 22.5 mag , 21.0 mag and 21.0 mag .",

    "the fov is 50 @xmath050 arcmin .",
    "we have thus made 20 follow - up observations in response to the _ hete-2 _ and _ integral _ alerts , and successfully detected the optical afterglows of 6 grbs . there",
    "20 observations ( 16 grbs and 4 xrfs ) were performed earlier than the delay timing ( @xmath2 hours ) of the _ bepposax _ position alerts . in the _ bepposax _ era ,",

    ", the light curve is well fitted for a single power law , which temporal index is @xmath4 with a reduced @xmath5(@xmath6 ) of 1.12 for @xmath7 . in order to better constrain the early ( @xmath8 0.3 days ) behavior of the light curve , we combined our data with the two @xmath3 band photometric points observed using the sso 40-inch telescope and reported in price et al .",

    "thus , we have successfully fitted the very early ( 0.065 - 0.293 days ) @xmath3 band light curve to a single power law .",

    "the fit failed with @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "based on this large value of @xmath14 , we can rule out the uemura et al.s model ( 2003 ) , at a more than 99.99% confidence level .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the structures reported by uemura et al ( 2003 ) , and sato et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "first , uemura et al included a variable star in their list of standard stars , and used it in their calibrations .",
    "second , an `` under - sampling system '' ( which means that the pixel scale for the sky is larger than the point spread function of the sources ) , due to using a `` front illuminated ccd '' , which potentially produce a wiggling light curve , even if we observe stable objects .",
    "this is because the electrode structure on the ccd chip reduces the brightness of as object located on it . when observations are performed with de - focus , or larger sized seeing conditions , this effect is relaxed @xcite .",
    "they however do not discuss the information of their system clearly , such quick grb observations system tend to lead to `` under - sampling '' when entire grb error regions are concerned .",

    "in fact , the @xmath3 band light curve of the grb  041006 afterglow exhibits a plateau phase around 0.09 days ( urata et al .",
    "the afterglow of grb 021004 shows a clear re - brightening phase which peak at @xmath33 days ( urata et al .",
    "2003b ) and that of grb  030227 is suggestive of a similar plateau at @xmath30 days after the burst .",
    "these results , based mainly on our own data , also indicate that the early optical afterglow emissions are composed of two components : the initial `` flash '' or other jet component emissions which have a fast power - law decline and the genuine afterglow component , which emerges after of a few hours .",
