    "gamma - ray burst ( grb ) sources are distributed throughout the universe and their energy output is measured to be a substantial fraction of a solar rest mass equivalent @xcite .",
    "a variety of observations support the interpretation that these events are caused by cataclysmic stellar collapse or compact mergers , producing a fireball with bulk expansion lorentz factor @xmath11 . in the standard grb model a fireball made up of @xmath12 and magnetic fields with an admixture of baryons",
    "is produced by the release of a large amount of energy @xmath13 ergs in a region @xmath14 cm ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the observations indicate that typical fireballs are characterized by a luminosity @xmath15 erg s@xmath16 and durations @xmath17 s in the observer frame , with a large spread in both quantities .",
    "the outflow is controlled by the value of the dimensionless entropy @xmath18 injected at @xmath19 .",
    "previous discussions of fireball models have generally focused on the charged particle components , since they determine directly the photon signal .",
    "however , consideration of a neutron component introduces qualitatively new effects @xcite . in a @xmath20 fireball , for values of @xmath21 , the neutrons and protons acquire a relative drift velocity causing inelastic @xmath22 collisions and creating neutrinos .",
    "we investigate here the neutrino and photon signals from @xmath22 collisions following decoupling in grb .",
    "the @xmath6 gev neutrinos from this mechanism depend upon the presence of neutrons in the original explosion , but the neutrinos are created in simple physical processes occurring in the later stages of the fireball . on the other hand , the @xmath23 gev neutrinos discussed in refs . @xcite",
    "require the acceleration in shock waves of ultra - high energy protons interacting with photons .",
    "thus the 10 gev and the @xmath23 gev neutrinos reflect very different astrophysical processes and uncertainties .",
    "other processes , e.g. neutrinos from @xmath24 collisions@xcite also require shocks but have lower efficiencies , while 10 - 30 mev neutrinos from the original explosion@xcite are much harder to detect due to the lower cross sections .",
    "we show (  [ sec : nudet ] ) that the 10 gev neutrinos could be detectable by future km@xmath5 size detectors . the associated @xmath6 gev @xmath25-ray fluences are compatible with current detection rates , and may be detectable with future space missions .",
    "the dependence of these signals on the neutron / proton ratio @xmath26 provides a new tool to investigate the nature of the grb progenitor systems .",
    "moreover the predicted neutrino event rate depends on the asymptotic bulk lorentz factor of the neutrons , which is linked to that of the protons .",
    "the latter affects all the electromagnetic observables from the grb fireball , including the photospheric and shock radii , as well as the particle acceleration and non - thermal photon production .",
    "above the fireball injection radius @xmath19 the outflow velocity increases through conversion of internal energy into kinetic energy , the bulk lorentz factor @xmath27 varying as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the comoving temperature and @xmath30 mev is the initial temperature at @xmath19 ( henceforth denoting with primes quantities measured in the comoving frame ) .",
    "the flow may be considered spherical , which is a valid approximation also for a collimated outflow of opening angle @xmath31 , for the conditions discussed here . in a pure proton outflow the linear growth of @xmath27",
    "saturates when it reaches an asymptotic value @xmath32 constant , the value @xmath33 being achieved when the fireball converts all its luminosity into expansion kinetic energy . for an @xmath22 fireball , beyond the injection radius @xmath19",
    "the comoving temperature is low and nuclear reactions are rare , so the @xmath34 ratio @xmath26 remains constant . since the thermal velocities are non - relativistic , decoupling of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 fluids is essential for high - energy neutrino production . at the base of the outflow the @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    "components are coupled by nuclear elastic scattering . in terms of the cm relative energy @xmath37 and the relative velocity @xmath38 between nucleons , @xmath39 . the cm energy dependence",
    "@xmath40 is approximately valid between energies @xmath1 mev and the pion production threshold @xmath41 mev , and @xmath42 @xmath43 is the pion formation cross section above threshold .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath35 are cold in the comoving frame , and remain well coupled until the comoving @xmath22 scattering time @xmath44 becomes longer than the comoving expansion time @xmath45 . denoting the comoving neutron density @xmath46 with @xmath47 , mass conservation implies @xmath48 $ ] .",

    "if @xmath140 , the anti - fred component would be hard to distinguish because of the superposition of the ongoing @xmath36 and @xmath35 components .",
    "however , for short bursts with @xmath141 s , the @xmath36 and @xmath35 components are separated : first there is a pulse of duration @xmath114 with a random envelope , followed after a time @xmath142 by a pulse with an anti - fred envelope of duration @xmath131 , and characteristic photon energy softer than the previous by @xmath143 ( which if small could be below the batse band , but may be detectable with the swift satellite@xcite ) .",

    "constraints on the neutron fraction could provide information about the progenitor stellar system giving rise to grb .",
    "for instance , core collapse of massive stars would lead to an outflow from an @xmath163-rich core with @xmath164 , while neutron star mergers would imply @xmath165 .",
    "photodissociation during collapse or merger , as well as @xmath22 decoupling and inelastic collisions , would both drive @xmath26 toward unity , although this equalization process is likely to remain incomplete . for low @xmath166 ,",
