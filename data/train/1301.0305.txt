    "the presence of various horizons within our cosmological models have greatly elucidated our understanding of the workings of the universe , with both the particle and event horizons limiting the connexions between past and future cosmological events @xcite .",
    "the universe also possesses a hubble sphere , which is not a horizon , and is the distance from an observer that comoving objects are moving , due to the cosmic expansion , at the speed of light ( in proper coordinates see * ? ? ?",
    "there has been the claim that the universe possess another , previously unidentified , horizon , dubbed the cosmic horizon ( @xmath0 ) , and the presence of this horizon significantly influences our observations of the cosmos  @xcite , although several authors have demonstrated that a number of the key claims about the cosmic horizon are incorrect  @xcite .    in this brief contribution",
    ", we discuss the recent claims of @xmath0  in the presence of phantom energy @xcite , again showing them to be demonstrably incorrect .",
    "in section  [ cosmichorizon ] we briefly review the nature of @xmath0 , while in section  [ photon ] we discuss what @xmath0  means for the path of a photon traveling though an expanding universe .",
    "section  [ evolvinghorizons ] demonstrates that @xmath0  still fails to behave as an unrecognised horizon in limiting our view of the universe , and the conclusions are presented in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the concept of the cosmic horizon , @xmath0 , was introduced by @xcite who , in rewriting the standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) invariant interval in ` observer - dependent coordinates ' found metric terms that appeared to be singular at a proper distance of @xmath0=@xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hubble constant ; it is important to remember that @xmath2 evolves over cosmic time , and so @xmath0  is a similarly evolving proper distance from an observer . in this initial work , @xcite claimed that the divergence of the metric components showed that @xmath0  represented an infinite redshift surface , and hence a limit to our view of the universe .",
    "however , this was shown as being incorrect by @xcite , who demonstrated that the infinite redshift was due to a unphysical choice for the coordinate velocity of an emitter at a distance of @xmath0 , and correctly accounting for the coordinate transformation between frw and observer coordinates results in the same redshift ; hence we can see photons that have traveled through @xmath0 .    as noted in @xcite ,",
    "the un - horizon - like properties come as no surprise as @xmath0  is exactly the same as the hubble sphere , a very well understood concept in cosmology @xcite . while in our current cosmology the hubble sphere will eventually become coincident with our event horizon ( see figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is not , in itself , a horizon .",
    "however , there have been continuing claims about the fundamental nature of @xmath0 , and recently , @xcite considered the paths of photons over cosmic history , examining the proper distance traversed since the big bang . in considering several standard cosmological models",
    ", they concluded that the fundamental property of @xmath0  is that any photon we receive today can not have traveled from a distance greater than @xmath0  today .",
    "however , this was also shown to be incorrect by @xcite who demonstrated that @xmath0  does not have to continuously grow or asymptote to a particular distance , and that if dark energy is actually of the form of phantom energy ( with an equation of state of @xmath3 ) , then @xmath0  can decrease .",
    "hence , light rays arriving at an observer can have travelled from a larger proper distance than @xmath0  today ( see figure 3 of * ? ? ?",
    ".    the question of the influence of phantom energy on @xmath0  was revisited in @xcite , who again redefined the cosmological properties of this cosmic horizon , concluding two key features of the photon paths should reassure us of its fundamental importance .",
    "these are that ;    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  the most important feature of these curves is that none of those actually reaching us [ today ] ever attain a proper distance greater than the maximum extent of our cosmic horizon . \" _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    and    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  every null geodesic that possesses a second turning point .... , diverges to infinity \" _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in the remainder of this paper , we will demonstrate that the first assertion is trivial , and the second is incorrect .",
    "as we have noted previously , @xmath0  simply corresponds to the hubble sphere @xcite , the distance from an observer at which the universal expansion results in a proper velocity of the speed of light for a comoving object . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the what passing through the hubble sphere means to a photon , although it should be noted that this has been discussed in detail previously ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "starting with the frw invariant interval for a spatially flat expanding space - time , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the comoving radial coordinate , @xmath6 is the time - dependent scale factor , and @xmath7 considers the angular coordinates . with this , the proper distance to an object at a comoving distance of @xmath5 is @xmath8 .",
    "for an observer at rest with regard to the comoving spatial coordinates , the experienced proper time is the same as the cosmic time , @xmath9 , and so we can talk of the relative velocity of the distant object with regards to the observer as being @xmath10 where the dots denote derivatives with regards to @xmath9 , and the @xmath11 represent motion relative to the comoving coordinates .    for the cosmological model outlined in section  [ evolvinghorizons ]",
    ", while the red lines present a series of light rays emanating from the big bang ( at the origin ) and into the future .",
    "note that the abscissa represent cosmic time , whereas the ordinate is proper distance from an observer ( at a proper distance of zero ) . in this representation ,",
    "four light rays arrive back at the observer ; the key light ray is the one arriving at @xmath12130 gyrs , as this has crossed @xmath0  three times .",
    "[ figure1 ] ]    if we consider a photon moving in the radial direction , so the angular terms in equation  [ frw ] can be neglected , and remembering that a photon path follows @xmath13 , then it is straight - forward to show @xmath14 and substituting the negative solution , as we are interested in a photon approaching the observer , into equation[velocity ] , we find @xmath15",
    "so at proper distances of @xmath16 , the photons are traveling , relative to the observer , at velocities not equal to the speed of light . at the distance of @xmath17 , which is @xmath0  ( or , in its proper parlance , the hubble sphere ) , then it is simple to see that @xmath18 , and the photon is at rest with regards to the observer ( in proper coordinates ) .",
    "what this means is that , in proper coordinates , a photon crossing @xmath0  represents an extremal or inflection point in the photon s path , and , considering that the photon path began at @xmath19 in the big bang , and returns to @xmath19 at a later time ( i.e. it is detected by an observer ) , there must be a ` most - distant ' turn - around point in the photon s journey , where it stops heading outward and starts heading inwards , and this must coincide with the photon crossing @xmath0 .    in summary ,",
    "the claim by @xcite that @xmath0  represents a bound to the observed photon s path is nothing more than saying  the maximal distance from which we receive a photon is no more than the largest distance at which it turns around in it journey \" ; this is a trivial statement .",
    "as a demonstration of the meaning of the cosmic horizon , we consider a universe in which @xmath0  can be tuned to be increasing or decreasing by modulating the equation of state of the dark energy component .",
    "we begin by adopting the cosmological parameters of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . unlike standard cosmological models",
    ", we allow the equation of state of the dark energy component , @xmath23 , to change as a function of time , adopting an evolutionary form given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the scaled cosmic time ; it should be noted that this evolution is not physically motivated and simply provides a model in which we can examine the corresponding evolution of @xmath0 . with this form",
    ", the transition in the form of the dark energy component takes place at @xmath26 , and the duration of the change over is @xmath27 , although the values were chosen for purely illustrative purposes .",
    "essentially , in the early universe , the dark energy component has an equation of state of @xmath28 , corresponding to a phantom energy , while around @xmath29 the equation of state begins to transition to @xmath30 , representing the equation of state of a relativistic mass - less fluid , such as photons .",
    "note that given this evolution , expansion means that the universe will become matter dominated in the future , given that the energy density in the now photon - like dark energy component diminishes faster with cosmological expansion .    in figure",
    "[ figure1 ] , we present the key properties of this universe in terms of the cosmic time ( abscissa ) and proper distance ( ordinate ) . the blue curve denotes the evolution of @xmath0 , whereas the red curves represent light rays which emanate from the big bang ( at the origin ) and travel into the future .",
    "the left - hand half of the plot can be compared directly with figure 3 of @xcite , with @xmath0  increasing when the universe is matter dominated , and then decreasing as the phantom energy comes to dominate . however , as the equation of state of the dark energy component evolves towards @xmath30 , then @xmath0  rapidly increases .",
    "an examination of the light rays in figure  [ figure1 ] show that , in this representation of the universe , all photons head outwards after the big bang . following this initial motion ,",
    "three of the photon paths then encounter the evolving @xmath0  only once , and then arrive back at the observer ; this can be simply understood as , in proper coordinates , @xmath0  marks the turning point in a photon s path .",
    "one photon path in figure  [ figure1 ] does not encounter @xmath0 , so that there is no turning point in its path and it does not return to the observer .",
    "there are two additional light rays which cross @xmath0  more than once .",
    "again , these rays are initially heading away from the origin after the big bang , and both of them cross @xmath0  and begin to head back towards the observer .",
    "however , due to the presence of the phantom energy component , both photon paths encounter a decreasing @xmath0  and the motion is reversed and the paths again move away from the observer ; note that while one of these paths appear have a point of inflection , just touching @xmath0 , it actually does possess two crossings . as the equation of state of the dark energy component is changing and influencing the cosmic expansion , while one photon path escapes to larger distance ,",
    "the other is again reversed , at a point where the photon passes through @xmath0 and it now continues its journey towards the observer , arriving at a cosmic time of @xmath31 .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the claim made by @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the results presented in this paper do not depend upon the specific form of the evolving dark energy described by equation  [ equationofstate ] .",
    "if we consider a universe with single energy component described by an equation of state @xmath23 , then @xmath0  evolves as @xmath32 and hence for phantom energies , with @xmath33 , @xmath0  would decrease , for a cosmological constant @xmath34 it is a constant , and all other fluids , with @xmath35 , @xmath0  increases . if equation  [ equationofstate ] is modified so that the ultimate equation of state of the dark energy component is @xmath36 , corresponding to matter , @xmath0  will increase in the future , similar to the evolution shown in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "again outward moving light rays encountering this increasing @xmath0  will change direction and will head back to the observer .",
    "an examination of the discussion presented here should convince the reader that by modifying the equations of state of the energy components of the universe , we could ensure that @xmath0oscillates through a arbitrarily complex path , and similarly that photon journeys can be made to arbitrarily change their direction of motion toward or away from an observer .",
    "each change of direction is accompanied with the photon crossing in and out of @xmath0 , which is extremely un - horizon - like behaviour ( but precisely what you would expect as @xmath0being a turning point in a photon s path ) .",
    "we have examined the most recent claims of the fundamental nature of the cosmic horizon , @xmath0 , made by @xcite , especially its behaviour in the presence of phantom energy .",
    "we have demonstrated that , by modifying the equation of state of the energy components in the universe , then @xmath0   can be made to grown and shrink arbitrarily .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath0  represents the location of where a photon changes direction , or goes through an inflection point , ( in proper coordinates ) relative to an observer , an oscillating photon path can cross @xmath0  a multitude of times before arriving at an observer .",
    "the fundamental property of @xmath0  in terms of the farthest proper distance from which an observer receives a photon is essentially a trivial statement .    as we have stressed in other contributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the importance and evolution of true cosmic horizons is well understood , as is the mean of the hubble sphere  @xcite .",
    "other than the trivial , the cosmic horizon of @xcite does not present a fundamental limit to our view of the universe .",
    "luke barnes and krzysztof bolejko are thanked for interesting discussions , and brendon brewer is thanked for his insights into python .",
