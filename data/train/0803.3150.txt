    "within the growing field of sociophysics ( see  @xcite for the defining paper , and @xcite-@xcite for an impression of the recent state of the art ) , two- and three states galam opinion models and their modifications ( @xcite , @xcite ) play a guiding role in analyzing the process of opinion spreading in communities .",
    "these models are centered around the _ local majority rule _ ( l.m.r . ) , which is applied either in a deterministic or a probabilistic way . in the basic _ deterministic _ case , supporters of the ( two or three ) opinions present in a community are randomly distributed over all possible groups of a fixed size . within each group",
    "the members adopt the opinion that has the majority in that group , after which all group members are recollected again . in case",
    "there is no majority in a group , its members stick to their own opinion ( i.e. , _ neutral _ treatment ; the _ probabilistic _ treatment in case of a tie assigns opinions to the group members according to a certain probability distribution ) .",
    "repeated application of this principle generates what is called _ randomly localized dynamics with a local majority rule _",
    "( @xcite ) . in the basic _ probabilistic _ case , the community members are divided among groups of various sizes according to some probability distribution , and within each group all members adopt one of the possible opinions with a certain probability .    in the basic deterministic two states opinion model , fast dynamics",
    "occurs in which the opinion that originally has the majority eventually will obtain complete presence at the cost of the alternative opinion . in the probabilistic two states opinion model ,",
    "the final outcome depends on the probability distributions for group sizes and local adaptation .",
    "eventually the state of the community can be either a polarization on the initial majority or minority , or a perfect consensus on both opinions ( see  @xcite , which unifies basic probabilistic two states opinion models ) . in",
    "@xcite a three states opinion model is introduced in which the community members are randomly distributed over groups of size 3 . within each group",
    "the l.m.r . is applied , with the additional rule that in case of a tie all members of the group adopt one of the three opinions according to some probability distribution .",
    "it is shown that the dynamics leads to fast polarization on one of the three opinions , which may be an opinion that initially has a minor presence in the community .    to add more realism to opinion models , in  @xcite the basic deterministic two states galam opinion model",
    "is extended by the introduction of so - called contrarians .",
    "contrarian _ is a community member who , instead of the opinion it should adopt under the l.m.r .",
    ", switches to the alternative opinion . depending on the density of contrarians as well as on group size , their presence either leads to a stabilization of the opinion dynamics in which one opinion ( the one with the lower density of contrarians ) dominates the other , to an equilibrium in which neither opinion dominates ( in case both opinions have equal densities of contrarians ) , or ( in case of relatively large densities of contrarians for both opinions ) to a dynamics in which the dominating opinion constantly alternates between the two opinions .",
    "the incorporation of contrarians in opinion dynamics models is a step towards an explanation of the `` hung elections '' outcome in several recent voting events ( the u.s.a .",
    "presidential elections in 2000 , the german elections in 2002 and 2005 , as well as the 2006 italian elections , see  @xcite , @xcite ) , in which one strategy achieved only a very narrow gain at the cost of another strategy .",
    "the origin of contrarian behaviour as well as its implications have been the focus of various other recent studies , see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in a recent paper  ( @xcite )",
    "the basic deterministic two states galam model has been modified by introducing opinion supporters that express what in politics ( and other games ) is called _",
    "inflexible behavior_. an inflexible community member is a supporter that under all conditions sticks to its opinion . under this terminology supporters that switch opinion when in the minority then classify as _",
    "floaters _ , and we shall use this distinction in what follows . in  @xcite the effect of inflexible behavior on opinion dynamics is studied for the case that opinion supporters repeatedly meet in groups of fixed size 3 .",
    "it is shown that a small density of inflexibles for only one of the two opinions allows for the existence of two local attractors .",
    "one of these local attractors is a mixed one , on which both opinions are present and on which the opinion that is supported by inflexibles is a minority .",
    "the other attractor is a single state attractor , on which the opinion that is supported by inflexibles has complete majority , i.e. , its density equals 1 , the other opinion being absent . due to the presence of these two attractors , the outcome of the opinion dynamics thus depends on the initial condition , the basin of attraction for the mixed local attractor being relatively small compared to that for the single state attractor .",
    "if the density of inflexibles is sufficiently large ( approximately 17@xmath0 ) , the mixed attractor disappears and the single state attractor becomes global . in case both opinions have small and equal densities of inflexibles there are two mixed local attractors .",
    "these two attractors are symmetrically situated with regard to a separator on which both opinions are present with density @xmath1 .",
    "a change in the density of inflexibles for one of the opinions breaks this symmetry , and a sufficiently large increase may lead to a global attractor on which the opinion with the larger density of inflexibles has the majority , see  @xcite . recently , the effect of inflexibles and floaters on opinion dynamics has also been studied in  @xcite and  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we combine the approaches presented in  @xcite and  @xcite , by allowing for groups composed of inflexibles as well as contrarian and non - contrarian opinion supporters . for clarity",
    "we restrict ourselves to groups of fixed size at most 3 . for both opinions we assume fixed densities for the inflexibles . also , we consider the contrarians to be part of the floaters , i.e. , in a given group the contrarians first determine their opinion according to the l.m.r . , and subsequently change to become a floater ( not necessarily a contrarian ) for the alternative opinion ( which thus may be the opinion that the contrarian initially was supporting ) .",
    "the presence of contrarians for each opinion is quantitatively expressed as a fixed fraction of the density of floaters of the respective opinion . in case of a tie in groups of size 2",
    "we apply the neutral treatment . after an opinion update ,",
    "all supporters for both opinions are recollected and then are redistributed again , either as an inflexible or as a non - contrarian or contrarian floater , according to the fixed densities for inflexibles and the fixed fractions of contrarians for the two opinions .",
    "we study qualitative characteristics of the opinion dynamics generated by repeated updates .",
    "in particular we study changes in the number of equilibria , and changes from monotone to alternating dynamics , due to changes in parameter combinations . a detailed mathematical treatment of the generated opinion dynamics , for groups of arbitrary size ,",
    "shall be given in a forthcoming paper  ( @xcite ) .",

    "the fraction of contrarians among the @xmath2 floaters is denoted by @xmath10 , and @xmath11 denotes the fraction of contrarians among the @xmath3 floaters , with both @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the size of the groups in which opinion supporters meet is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the density of the @xmath2 opinion at time @xmath15 ( or after @xmath16 updates ) shall be denoted as @xmath17 .",
    "note that for given @xmath4 and @xmath5 the density @xmath17 necessarily lies in the interval @xmath18 $ ] ( independent of @xmath14 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) .",
    "with @xmath19 we denote the function that determines the density of the @xmath2 opinion after application of the l.m.r .",
    "followed by the switch of the contrarians .",
    "thus , @xmath20 . setting @xmath21",

    "is applied without being followed by the switch of the contrarians . in the appendix tables",

    "the opinion changes of contrarians .",
    "it is assumed that the community is sufficiently large to allow for the derivation of the density of each possible group composition in the ensemble of all groups of a fixed size from the densities in the community of the constituents of a group . from these tables",
    "the expressions for @xmath24 are obtained .",
    "+ with @xmath25 we denote the dynamics generated by repeated application of @xmath26 in subsequent timesteps .",
    "furthermore , @xmath27 denotes an asymptotically stable equilibrium for @xmath28 , and @xmath29 refers to an asymptotically stable periodic point .",
    "+ we now turn to the treatment of the opinion dynamics for group sizes @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the case @xmath23 resembles a community in which each member is unaffected by other community members in determining its opinion , and the only changes in opinion come from the contrarians .",
    "the contributions to the @xmath2 density after application of the local majority rule is obtained from the second column in table 1 in appendix  [ subsection : t1 ] .",
    "this column obviously is equal to the first one , since in groups of size @xmath32 local majority is automatically obtained , but is without effect on the opinion densities .",
    "these contributions are : @xmath4 for the @xmath2 inflexibles , and @xmath33 for the ( non - contrarian and contrarian ) @xmath2 floaters .",
    "their sum is @xmath34 , and we obtain that @xmath35    consequently , each @xmath36 $ ] is a neutrally stable equilibrium for the opinion dynamics .    in case only (",
    "non - contrarian and contrarian ) floaters are involved both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are equal to 0 , and we restrict ourselves to the contributions from the second , third , fifth and sixth line in the table . since the l.m.r . leaves each group of size 1 unaffected , a switch by a contrarian in this case necessarily implies a change to the opinion it initially does not support .",
    "thus , here also a contribution to the @xmath2 density comes from the group that initially consists of only @xmath3 contrarians , as these will turn into @xmath2 floaters . in this case",
    "we obtain for the contribution to the @xmath2 density : @xmath37    the effect of both inflexibles and non - contrarian as well as contrarian floaters is obtained by adding all the expressions in the last column : the contributions @xmath4 due to the invariant density of @xmath2 inflexibles , @xmath38 from the non - contrarian @xmath2 floaters , and @xmath39 from the contrarian @xmath3 floaters .",
    "this yields :    @xmath40    it follows that if @xmath41 , then @xmath42 is the unique equilibrium for the opinion dynamics @xmath43 .",
    "due to its linearity as a function of @xmath44 , expression  ( [ eq : l=1general ] ) implies that the dynamical characteristics of this equilibrium are governed solely by the frequencies of the contrarians .",
    "the equilibrium is asymptotically stable if and only if @xmath45 .",

    "the function @xmath48 is constant and equals @xmath49 ; the opinion dynamics then reaches its equilibrium in one iteration . for @xmath50 ,",

    "+ on the equilibrium , the @xmath2 opinion has the majority if and only if the inequality @xmath55 holds .",
    "thus , for an opinion to achieve the majority it is required that it is being supported by a sufficiently large density of inflexibles , and/or a sufficiently small frequency of contrarians among the floaters .",
    "+ given densities @xmath4 and @xmath5 of inflexibles for the two opinions , a change in the frequencies of contrarians from 0 into small values @xmath10 and @xmath11 causes the bifurcation from a collection of neutrally stable equilibria for @xmath56 into a unique stable equilibrium for @xmath57 . the opinion which has the majority on this equilibrium is determined by inequality  ( [ eq : l=1majority ] ) . in case @xmath58 , the opinion with the smaller frequency of contrarians obtains the majority .",
    "conversely , given different frequencies @xmath10 and @xmath11 of contrarian floaters for the two opinions , in the absence of inflexibles the dynamics @xmath59 has @xmath60 as its unique stable equilibrium , on which the opinion with the smaller frequency of contrarians has the majority .",
