    "we suggest a different approach to solve problem [ problem ] .",
    "the key observation is the following : inspecting the list of surfaces in theorem [ classiso ] ( cf .",
    "@xcite , tables 1 , 2 ) , one notices that all minimal product - quotient surfaces with @xmath12 have the property that @xmath20 is generated by the fibres of the two fibrations and the irreducible components of the exceptional divisor of the minimal resolution of singularities @xmath21 , whereas for the single non - minimal product - quotient surface with @xmath22 , this is not the case . here",
    "the fibres and the exceptional curves generate a subspace of codimension 2 .    this remark led us to study , for a general product - quotient surface @xmath10 , the subspace of @xmath20 generated by the fibres of the two fibrations and the irreducible components of the exceptional divisor of the minimal resolution of singularities @xmath21 .",

    "looking at the program used in @xcite , one notices that almost half of the computations when running for @xmath12 had to deal with the case @xmath25 .",
    "this information could of course now be used to speed up the computations quite a bit .    instead , we chose to write a different program , substituting ( as input ) @xmath0 to @xmath26 . the result is a much quicker program , producing dozens of new regular product - quotient surfaces with @xmath12 ( and several with @xmath27 , on which we do not report here ) .",
    "the computations we did suggest the following    let @xmath10 be a product - quotient surface .",
    "then @xmath10 is minimal if and only if @xmath28 .",
    "we shall prove the conjecture for surfaces with vanishing geometric genus ( cf .",
    "theorem [ gamma0 ] ) .    running our program for @xmath29 , produces three examples of surfaces of general type , two with @xmath30 ( including the surface in theorem [ classiso ] , 4 ) , and one with @xmath31 : the two new examples , both numerical godeaux surfaces , are described in section [ constructions ] . together with the results @xcite we have 75 families of product - quotient surfaces of general type with @xmath32 and we conjecture that these are all .",
    "what we can prove , is the following :    let @xmath10 be a product - quotient surface of general type with @xmath12 not among the @xmath33 families just mentioned . then    * either @xmath34 , * or @xmath35 and @xmath3 has a singular point of multiplicity at least @xmath36 , * or @xmath31 and @xmath3 has a singular point of multiplicity at least @xmath37 .    on the way to prove the above we produce a substantial number of product - quotient surffaces not of general type , collected in the tables [ k2<1 ] , [ gamma1 ] , [ gamma2 ] , [ gamma2b ] and [ gamma3 ] .",

    "finally in section [ duality ] we construct a duality among regular product - quotient surfaces allowing , among other things , to give a new interpretation of the `` half - codimension '' @xmath40 , which in fact turns out to be equal to the geometric genus of the dual product - quotient surface .",
