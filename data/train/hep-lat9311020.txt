    "[ 0.0cm][0.0cm]preprint hlrz 93 - 70 november 1993 the @xmath0 sigma term , @xmath1 , is defined as that part of the mass of the nucleon coming from the expectation value of the up ( @xmath2 ) and down ( @xmath3 ) quark mass terms in the qcd hamiltonian , @xmath4 where we have taken these quarks to have equal current mass ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "other contributions to the nucleon mass come from the chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic gluon pieces and the sea terms due to the @xmath6 quarks .",
    "experimentally this matrix element has been measured from low energy @xmath7-@xmath8 scattering , @xcite . a delicate extrapolation to the chiral limit @xcite",
    "gives a result for the isospin even amplitude of @xmath9 with @xmath10 , from which the @xmath0 sigma term may be found .",
    "the precise value obtained this way has been under discussion for many years . for orientation we shall just quote a range of results from later analyses of @xmath11 , @xcite , down to @xmath12 , @xcite .    to estimate valence and sea contributions to @xmath1 , classical current algebra analyses assume octet dominance and make first order perturbation theory about the @xmath13 flavour symmetric hamiltonian .",
    "this gives @xmath14 where we have first assumed that the nucleon wavefunction does not change much around the symmetric point .",
    "we then subtract and add a strange component . at the symmetric point the @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks each have equal valence and sea part , while the @xmath6 quark matrix element only has a sea component .",
    "thus in the first term the sea contribution cancels , justifying the definitions given in eq .",
    "( [ theory.c ] ) . using first order perturbation theory for the baryon mass splittings @xmath15 may be calculated to give @xmath16 and so @xmath17 .",
    "this in turn means that @xmath18 , which would indicate a sizeable portion of the nucleon mass ( @xmath19 ) comes from the strange quark contribution .",
    "we now turn to our lattice calculation . we have generated configurations using dynamical staggered fermions on a @xmath20 lattice at @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( plus some larger masses ) ,",
    "practically there are several possibilities open to us for the evaluation of the matrix element .",
    "the easiest is simply to differentiate the shift operator @xmath23 giving @xmath24 ( the feynman - hellmann theorem ) .",
    "thus we need to measure @xmath25 for different masses @xmath26 and numerically estimate the gradient .",
    "this leads to @xmath27 giving @xmath28 , which is to be compared with the experimental result of @xmath29 .",
    "the numerical result is much larger , but presumably this simply indicates that we have used much too large a quark mass in our simulation ( @xmath30 , @xcite ) . at present",
    "we , and everybody else , can not avoid doing this .",
    "we now wish to separately estimate the valence and sea contributions .",
    "this is technically more complicated and involves the evaluation of a @xmath31-point correlation function , @xcite , ( @xmath32 baryon ) @xmath33 ( @xmath34 wall source ) .",
    "this may be diagrammatically sketched as the sum of two terms :    = 3.0 cm [ figsketch ]    \\(a ) is the connected ( or valence ) term ; the nucleon quark lines are joined with the mass insertion .",
    "( b ) represents the disconnected ( or sea ) term .    for the connected piece we have fixed @xmath35 to be @xmath36 or",
    "@xmath37 and then evaluated @xmath38 as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "the appropriate fit function is , with @xmath40 , ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 denoting the parity partner to the nucleon , @xmath8 , @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) . @xmath46 and @xmath47 are known from @xmath48-point correlation functions .",
    "we see that when @xmath49 we have the matrix element that we require : @xmath50 .",
    "however there are other terms which complicate the fit : @xmath51 and the cross terms @xmath52 which are responsible for oscillations in the result . to disentangle the wanted result from @xmath51 we need to make a joint fit to the @xmath53 and @xmath54 results . at present",
    "we have not done this , but just checked that separate fits give consistent results . in fig .",
    "[ figconn ] we show preliminary    = 12.5 cm    [ figconn ]    results for @xmath53 .",
    "( up until now we have only evaluated about a quarter of our available configurations . )",
    "we find @xmath55 with about the same result for the @xmath41 matrix element .",
    "the cross term is smaller , roughly @xmath56 .",
    "finally we have attempted to estimate the disconnected term using a stochastic estimator , @xcite .",
    "( @xmath57 sets of gaussian random numbers were used . )",
    "one can improve the statistics by summing the 3-point correlation function over @xmath39 ; this is then equivalent to a differentiation of the 2-point function with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "this gives @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) . in fig .",
    "[ figdisc ] we show the disconnected 3-point    = 12.5 cm    [ figdisc ]    correlation function . as expected the quality of the data is poor  optimistically we see a slope .",
    "a simple linear fit gives @xmath60",
    "we see that roughly eq .",
    "( [ measure.b ] ) is consistent with eqs .",
    "( [ measure.f],[measure.h ] ) and that @xmath61 , which is to be compared with the experimental value of about @xmath62 .",
    "although we can draw no firm conclusions at present our result tentatively indicates that the valence term is slightly larger than the sea term .",
    "comparing our results with other work obtained using dynamical fermions , @xcite uses @xmath48 flavours of wilson fermions and finds for the ratio @xmath63 , which indicates a somewhat larger sea component . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite using results from @xcite for @xmath48 staggered flavours finds @xmath64 , while @xcite has @xmath65 .",
    "these , like our result , seem to be lower than for the wilson fermion case",
    ".    we would also like to emphasise that although lattices can give a first principle calculation , at present one is not able to do this .",
    "technically the fit formul that we employ , eqs .",
    "( [ measure.e ] , [ measure.g ] ) are true only for the complete correlation function .",
    "the best way to circumvent this problem and others is to make simulations at different strange quark masses ; differentiation as in eq .",
    "( [ measure.a ] ) would then give directly @xmath66 , the strange content of the nucleon .",
    "however this calculation is not feasible at the present time",
    ". this should be the ultimate goal of lattice simulations , as other recent theoretical results , @xcite , have hinted that perhaps the strange quark content of the nucleon is not as large as supposed , previous results being explained by a combination of factors , such as @xmath67 and higher order corrections to first order perturbation theory .",
    "( indeed there are already tantalising lattice indications , @xcite . )    in conclusion we would just like to say that lattice results at present are generally in qualitative agreement with other theoretical and experimental results .",
    "however much improvement is required to be able to make quantitative predictions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the dfg .",
    "the numerical computations were performed on the hlrz cray y - mp in jlich . we wish to thank both institutions for their support ."
