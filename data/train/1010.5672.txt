    "upon fast enough cooling , most liquids avoid cristallization and enter a supercooled state .",
    "the latter is characterized by the `` viscous slowing down '' phenomenon @xcite , an extremely fast increase of the viscosity when the temperature @xmath6 is decreased . below the glass transition temperature",
    "@xmath7 the viscosity is so high that the system is , in practice , a solid .",
    "the glass transition is a longstanding issue of condensed matter physics , since no structural signature has ever been detected around @xmath7 , e.g. the static neutron spectra do not change at @xmath7 , contrary to what happens for the cristallization @xcite .",
    "significant progresses in understanding the physics of the glass transition were made in the last fifteen years , when the heterogeneous nature of the dynamics of supercooled liquids was established , through various experimental @xcite as well as numerical works @xcite .",
    "the important concept of ` dynamical heterogeneities ' has emerged @xcite , according to which the relaxation comes from the collective motion of groups of @xmath8 molecules .",
    "all these groups evolve in time , some of them being faster or slower than the average dynamics .",
    "the viscous slowing down would come from the fact that this number @xmath8 increases as @xmath6 decreases towards @xmath7 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath8 thus became a crucial issue in the field , triggering new theoretical ideas @xcite .",
    "one of them came from an analogy @xcite with the well known spin glass physics in which the nonlinear suceptibility diverges at the critical temperature @xmath9 , reflecting the long range amorphous order which sets in at @xmath9 .",
    "it was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that a similar effect occurs in supercooled liquids , with the key difference that the peak of the nonlinear response @xmath10 should appear at finite frequencies @xmath11 of the order of @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the relaxation time of the supercooled liquid . for the first time , a ( nonlinear ) susceptibility was directly related to the quantity @xmath8 of interest , allowing to scrutinize its temperature dependence .",
    "we have performed recently the corresponding experiment for the nonlinear dielectric susceptibility of glycerol @xcite and shown that the @xmath14 dependence was indeed an increase as @xmath6 decreases .    the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath0 measured in refs .",

    ", one finds that @xmath18 is typically around @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the polarisation at the frequency @xmath11 ( mainly dominated by the linear response of the system ) . due to the small value of @xmath18 , a thorough analysis is required to see whether some ` spurious ' effects can affect the @xmath15 measurements .",
    "expanding on the arguments given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we study in this paper the contribution of the ac heating of the liquid to our @xmath15 measurements .",

    ", we call the heating contribution to the nonlinear susceptibility investigated here homogeneous heating contribution.    the paper is organised as follows : in section [ ii ] we derive the relations which allow to calculate the heating contribution to @xmath15 . in section [ iii ]",
    "we give the corresponding results , and clearly show the temperature and frequency ranges where the heating contribution is negligible in our experiments . we eventually show that in the high frequency range , i.e. when @xmath31 , the heating contribution is damped by the finite relaxation time @xmath13 of the dipoles , and we estimate the magnitude of this damping .",
