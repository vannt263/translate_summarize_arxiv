    "for diffuse , neutral gases in space , two fundamental processes influence the pattern of abundances of different elements in free atomic form : ( 1 ) the contributions from various nucleosynthetic sources and how the outcomes are influenced by mixing and transport processes , and ( 2 ) the removal of atoms as they are incorporated into dust grains .",
    "there have been numerous studies of the gas - phase abundances of elements in the local region of our galaxy ( cowie & songaila 1986 ; savage & sembach 1996 ) , using information provided by uv interstellar absorption lines in the spectra of stars .",
    "these investigations have generally focused on the second of the two processes ( jenkins , savage , & spitzer 1986 ; sofia , cardelli , & savage 1994 ) , using abundances in the sun or nearby , early - type stars as a comparison template for material that would be free of dust . by contrast , studies of very distant gas systems that produce absorption lines in quasars have concentrated on the history of element production ( pettini , boksenberg , & hunstead 1990 ; pettini et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 ; timmes , lauroesch , & truran 1995 ; lu et al .",
    "1996 ) , i.e. , its character and rate , and have regarded the depletions caused by dust formation as a possible complication that , if present , must be compensated for .    it is generally recognized that the overall severity of a given element s depletion is correlated with the stability of chemical bonds of likely compounds in the grains .",
    "this differential effect can be interpreted to result from either the relative completeness of the element s incorporation into grains in the outer envelopes of stellar atmospheres ( field 1974 ) , how rapidly the element contributes to the growth of grains in dense interstellar clouds ( snow 1975 ; tielens & allamandola 1987 ) , or the relative resistance of different grain components due to destruction by interstellar shocks ( seab 1987 ; jones et al .",
    "1994 ; tielens et al . 1994 ) .",
    "elements that have very strong bonds in dust compounds , such as al , ti and ca , are depleted by as much as 2 to 3 orders of magnitude ( jenkins 1987 ) , while more volatile elements , such as c , n and o , have depletions of only factors of 2 or 3 ( hibbert , dufton , & keenan 1985 ; meyer , et al .",
    "1994 ; cardelli et al .",
    "1996 ; meyer , cardelli , & sofia 1997 ; meyer , jura , & cardelli 1997 ) or perhaps even less  see below .",
    "noble gases represent the greatest extreme of volatility , since they generally do not form chemical bonds with solid compounds , and they can adhere to grains only through the very weak van der waals force ( watson 1976 ) .",
    "this paper presents observations of the interstellar abundances of one such noble gas , the element argon in its neutral form .",
    "one feature of this study is the fact that the lines of sight have a low average gas density , and this further reduces the likelihood that the abundances are modified by dust formation ( jenkins 1987 ) .",
    "neutral argon has two strong resonance lines in the far ultraviolet .",
    "their f - values differ by a factor of 4 ( federman et al . 1992 ) , which allows one to test for line saturation and apply corrective measures ( or realize that the saturation is hopelessly bad ) . while the interstellar ar features are easily recognizable in most spectra , their great strength turns out to be a liability because the lines become strongly saturated when dense clouds are being investigated .",
    "for instance , for a velocity dispersion @xmath9 = @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the weaker of the two ar  i lines at 1066.66  would have a central optical depth @xmath12 if the argon had a cosmic abundance ratio with respect to hydrogen .",
    "the consequences of such saturation are lessened if the line s velocity structure is mostly resolved by the instrument , because one can interpret the apparent optical depth as a function of velocity ( savage & sembach 1991 ; jenkins 1996 ) instead of the much cruder approach of just measuring the equivalent widths and using the standard curve of growth to derive a total column density .",
    "the observations reported here take advantage of an instrument that can , in most circumstances , resolve nearly all of the velocity detail of a feature , which puts us in a better position to derive accurate column densities than was possible with the _ copernicus _ satellite ( rogerson et al .",
    "1973a ) .",
    "the reference abundance of ar derived for the sun or b stars is now understood with reasonable accuracy ( see  [ abundances ] ) , and the difference between the two is not very large .",
    "the only major uncertainty is whether or not the solar or b - star abundances are indeed appropriate standards for comparison .",
    "recently accumulated evidence ( cardelli et al .",
    "1996 ; fitzpatrick 1996 ; meyer , cardelli , & sofia 1997 ; meyer , jura , & cardelli 1997 ; sofia et al .",
    "1997 ) indicates that some mildly depleted elements do not follow the usual trend of depletions becoming stronger in denser interstellar clouds ( spitzer 1985 ; jenkins , savage , & spitzer 1986 ; jenkins 1987 ) , as we would expect if these elements were major constituents in grains that are more abundant and larger in dense regions because they are protected from interstellar shocks and are allowed to grow rapidly ( tielens & allamandola 1987 ; jenkins 1989 ) .",
    "this phenomenon has raised the possibility that the intrinsic abundances of heavier elements in the local interstellar medium ( in both solid and gaseous form ) may be lower than for the nearby stars , and that the depletions by grain formation for some of them are relatively small in comparison to this deficiency , we adopt the term @xmath13 to mean how much more of the neutral form of argon is reduced compared to that of hydrogen , in contrast to a straight reduction @xmath14 that may occur when the gases are in a fully neutral region but ar condenses out onto the grains . ] .",
    "a noteworthy property of argon is that , while its neutral form has an ionization potential greater than that of hydrogen , its cross section for photoionization above this threshold is extraordinarily high . this is of no consequence for an interstellar cloud that is thick enough to have virtually all of its interior shielded from outside sources of ionizing radiation by a large column of neutral hydrogen .",
    "however the situation for thinner clouds is different .",
    "since the absorption cross section of hydrogen diminishes for energies well above the lyman limit , we naturally expect that relatively hard radiation must penetrate the cloud and partially ionize the hydrogen and argon atoms . in circumstances",
    "where some or almost all of the hydrogen is ionized , the fraction of argon that remains in neutral form can be considerably lower than the corresponding fraction for hydrogen . as a result",
    ", this element may deceptively appear to be `` depleted '' relative to hydrogen if one makes the simple - minded assumption that both elements are predominantly neutral .",
    "we will explore this issue in more detail in  [ ionization ] and present an assessment of the conditions where this effect is likely to be significant .",
    "our discussion starts with the observations and data reduction in  [ obs ] , followed by the resulting ar  i column densities (  [ col_dens ] ) and how they relate to measurements of neutral hydrogen along the same lines of sight (  [ abundances ] ) . in  [ previous ]",
    "we briefly compare our results with those of previous observations at much lower resolution . on the theoretical side , in  [ depletion ? ] we will present in greater depth the arguments that support our assertion that the apparent deficiencies of ar  i relative to h  i are unlikely to be caused by the depletion of ar onto dust grains .",
    "we argue in  [ ionization ] that for our observing circumstances the most likely reason for a reduction in ar  i is because it is readily photoionized by energetic radiation that is able to penetrate the region .",
    "we can use this effect to understand better the nature of the partially ionized clouds .",
    "ar is a good tracer element to indicate how strongly the apparent abundances of other elements could be influenced by ionization , and this information is crucial for research on the chemical evolution of the gases in different contexts .",
    "the ultraviolet absorption line data used for this study were obtained with the interstellar medium absorption profile spectrograph ( imaps ) during the first orfeus - spas space shuttle mission in september 1993 .",
    "imaps is a simple , objective - grating echelle spectrograph that can record the spectrum of a bright , hot star in the wavelength interval 950 to 1150 , a spectral region that is densely populated with atomic and molecular transitions from the neutral and ionized interstellar medium ( ism ) ( morton 1975 ; spitzer & jenkins 1975 ; cowie & songaila 1986 ) .",

    "here we examined the regions which contain the least contribution from the spectral orders , halfway between the order being extracted and each of the adjacent orders . since the shape of the order s cross - dispersion profile is known , we are able to subtract the contributions of the 2 adjacent orders from each of these interorder regions .",
    "the remaining light was assumed to be the smooth background which changes with position in the echelle dispersion direction .",
    "the average of the two interorder points on either side of the order being extracted was used as the background level and subtracted . to test the reliability of this method , we inspected the cores of lines that , from their appearance , are likely to be fully saturated and hence have zero intensity in their cores .",

    "the sampling interval for the curves in figure  [ intens_prof ] is one half - pixel on the ccd since the data are put into an oversampled format for reduction purposes ( jenkins et al .",

    "an interesting exercise is to compare the imaps absorption profiles with the corresponding ones observed in the 1970 s with _ copernicus _ ( rogerson et al .",
    "although these two instruments had very different wavelength resolving powers ( _ copernicus _ could resolve a velocity difference of about @xmath21 compared to @xmath22 for imaps ) , the equivalent widths of the absorption lines should be the same if the correct continua and background corrections were assigned in each case .",

    "such findings have led to the interpretations that the abundances of these elements are not appreciably affected by the formation of dust grains , at least over the range of cloud thicknesses and internal densities surveyed .",
    "instead , it has been argued that the total abundances of such elements in the local gas may be lower than those of the sun and possibly b stars ( fitzpatrick 1996 ) . while some of the deficiency of argon that we have detected may likewise be explained partly by this phenomenon",
    ", the variation of @xmath14 shown for the entries for @xmath1  pup , @xmath57  vel and @xmath3  cen  a in table  [ abund ] indicates that some additional process must be at work .",
    "we explore in this section the plausibility that argon could be depleted by interacting with other materials in the medium .    in the interstellar medium ,",
    "there are very few gas - phase compounds that incorporate the argon atom , since this element is chemically inert .",

    "for instance , oxygen atoms ( 250 times more abundant than argon ) or oxygen - bearing compounds ( principally water ice ) could cover argon atoms after their initial attachment to the grains .",
    "laboratory experiments have demonstrated that significant quantities of ar can be trapped during the accumulation of solid h@xmath37o on a cold surface ( bar - nun et al .",

    ", we could consider the possibility that argon atoms are locked inside coatings of water ice that accumulated at some previous time when the grains were inside a very dense cloud .",
    "if this were true , the argon would not be quickly liberated by photodesorption after the cloud had dissipated .",
    "however , observations of the @xmath92 m ice - band absorption feature indicate that ice - coated grains exist only within the densest portions of compact clouds . for such clouds , the approximate linear trends in @xmath93(3.05 ) vs. a@xmath94",

    "it therefore appears unlikely that our lines of sight hold grains that are coated with ice , and thus ar probably has little chance of being bound to the grains .    from the above considerations , we conclude that ar should be able to experience some depletion well inside clouds that are optically thick to radiation at the wavelength of the ar transitions ( the same ones that we can observe ) , and that have large internal hydrogen densities and grains with large diameters",
    "however , it appears likely that once the material is returned to the low density phase of the ism where we can observe the absorption lines , the argon atoms are rapidly returned to the free atomic form .",

    "this correction was simply a power - law in atomic mass , adjusted to make the abundances of he and ne agree with their respective cosmic ratios .",
    "even with this adjustable parameter , it appears that the values predicted for photoionization equilibrium given in table  [ other_elem ] are not easy to reconcile with the observations of anomalous cosmic rays , i.e. , he , ne and ar do not seem to be depressed below their cosmic abundances relative to o and n. it is possible that a modification of o and n abundances by the strong charge exchange reactions with solar wind protons in the heliospheric interface ( fahr , osterbart , & rucinski 1995 ) may effectively cancel the relative reductions in the noble gas abundances predicted in table  [ other_elem ] .",
    "we have measured the abundances of neutral argon relative to neutral hydrogen in the ism over 3 different lines of sight ( and obtained lower limits for 5 others ) .",
    "these abundances are lower than those measured in b - type stars or the sun , repeating an effect seen for other elements that do not have strong depletions caused by dust formation .",
    "in contrast to the relatively constant ism abundances of these other lightly depleted elements , our determinations indicate that argon s relative abundance seems to vary from one place to the next .    we have stated theoretical arguments to suggest that , for our lines of sight , it is unlikely that an appreciable amount of argon is bound into the dust grains that accompany the gas . instead",
    ", the missing ar can be explained by most of the atoms being ionized and thus becoming invisible to us in this survey .",
    "the very large photoionization cross section of neutral argon , relative to that of hydrogen , can result in argon being ionized more thoroughly than hydrogen in partially ionized regions . for a line of sight that shows the largest reduction of ar (",
    "that toward @xmath3  cen  a ) we conclude that the cloud must be broken into at least about 5 subclouds to allow radiation from the outside to penetrate most of the material and cause the effect that we observe .",
    "krypton is the only other noble gas that has been well studied in the neutral ism ( cardelli 1994 ; cardelli & meyer 1997 ) , and it too has a large cross section for ionization : @xmath206 above the ionization threshold ( marr & west 1976 ) . because kr has such a low cosmic abundance [ @xmath207 , ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) ] the uv absorption feature is very weak .",
    "thus , the studies of kr / h have featured sight lines that have @xmath208 , and regions with this much column density are expected to be fully shielded and neutral , except for those elements with ionization potentials below that of h. hence it is no surprise that the kr investigations do not uncover the abundance fluctuations that we see here for ar .",
    "the ratio of ar  i to h  i ( or some other element that is not usually depleted in the ism ) may offer a critical insight on the nature of the ionizing process that is responsible for the many neutral clouds that seem to be unexpectedly rich in free electrons .",
    "if such clouds are ionized mainly by photons , we should expect to see a reduction in the apparent abundance of ar  i. alternatively , if the ar  i seems normal , partial recombination from a fully ionized condition or the effects of collisional ionization may be more plausible interpretations ( trapero et al . 1996 ) .",
    "for instance , in collisional ionization equilibrium up to temperatures of around @xmath209k , the fractional abundances of argon in its neutral form are of order or slightly more than those of oxygen ( shull & van steenberg 1982 ) . above @xmath209k , @xmath210 , but both elements have less than 1% of their atoms in neutral form at these temperatures . for a gas that is cooling either isochorically or isobarically with some lag in the recombination , the fractional ionizations of o and ar are nearly identical for @xmath211 ( which means that @xmath212k ) ( benjamin & shapiro 1997 ) .    in future studies of uv absorption lines , it will be interesting to confirm the validity of our proposal that partially ionized regions offer an explanation for the reduction in ar  i. for instance , is there a correlation between @xmath213 and @xmath116 ( as indicated by the fine - structure excitations of c  ii or si  ii ) or the existence of atoms in moderately high stages of ionization , such as si  iii or s  iii ? if such correlations hold true , then we can use the ar  i abundances as either a powerful diagnostic on the nature of the ionization or , alternatively , as an indicator of whether the higher ions arise from a completely ionized classical h  ii region ( where there should be little ar  i or h  i ) or a partially ionized cloud of the type described here .",
