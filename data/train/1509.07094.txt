    "the milky way shows a galactic disk quite far from the planarity @xcite .",
    "this high degree of structure was first observed in the gas and can be classified into three categories associated with different regions and spatial scales of the disk : a ) the gas in the innermost region of the galaxy appears to be tilted with respect to the formal galactic plane @xcite ; b ) warping of the gas in the outer regions of the disk is almost a ubiquitous feature of spiral galaxies in the local universe , even for those that are seemingly isolated and c ) since the 1950s we have known that hi in the milky way shows a coherent wavy structure with respect to the fundamental plane of the galaxy in the inner region of the sun called  corrugations \" ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "corrugations have also been observed in different stellar populations of the milky way and both in the azimuthal direction along different spiral arms , and in the radial direction at different galactocentric radii @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is not just limited to our galaxy but has also been observed in external galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and for different tracers of both gas and stellar populations .",
    "in addition , although most of the stellar corrugations were determined from the distribution of young stars , infrared observations seem to show that old stellar populations also participate in this structure @xcite .",
    "all these results suggest that this is a universal phenomenon common in late - type galaxies , observable at almost any wavelength @xcite . however , despite the universality of this phenomenon it has barely been studied and is poorly understood .    these spatial corrugations clearly must be associated with wavy vertical motions in the galactic plane .",
    "evidence of these kinematic waves was first detected in the analysis of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it was not until @xcite analysed the velocity corrugations in ngc  5427 in more detail that a likely physical mechanism was proposed for their origin .",
    "henceforth , we use the term  velocity corrugation \" to refer to the observed wavy field of the velocity vertical component .",
    "the two kinds of structures have been observed in spiral galaxies : a ) spatial corrugations in our galaxy and other edge - on external galaxies , and b ) velocity corrugations in face - on galaxies .    given the nature of the problem , galaxy - observer geometry plays a fundamental role in the interpretation of the observables . within our galaxy",
    "we can easily observe the corrugated structure of the spiral arms in the solar neighbourhood in the optical range , as well as the hi structure at larger distances in the radio wavelength range .",
    "the vertical velocity field of these morphologies shows an almost null component in the direction of the line of sight .",
    "however , @xcite were able to detect true velocity gradients perpendicular to the galactic plane that could not be totally explained by geometric effects .",
    "by contrast , the face - on external galaxies represent the best natural laboratory for the study of the vertical velocity field , given that most of the observed radial velocity is representative of the galaxy disk velocity vertical component",
    ". however , they do not provide any information about spatial corrugations .    in summary , in the last 60 years several pieces of evidence",
    "have been collected showing that most disks of spiral galaxies present a residual wavy structure with respect to the galactic main plane .",
    "this undulatory behaviour is observable at different wavelengths , being representative of the gas in different physical conditions , as well as of different stellar populations .",
    "different scenarios have been proposed to explain this phenomenon ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there is a lack of systematic studies which would help to better understand these structures and their possible origin .    in this paper , we address the study of the vertical velocity in a sample of four nearly face - on spiral galaxies . as aforementioned ,",
    "the geometry of the problem is a main criterion in the selection of the sample as well as of the long slit azimuthal position angles . in section [ secsample ]",
    "we show the galaxy sample and their selection criteria .",
    "observations and data reduction details are presented in section [ secobs ] . in section [ secvz ]",
    "we describe the geometry of the problem and establish its fundamental relationships . the main results and relationships between the vertical component of the velocity field and the h@xmath0  emission lines are shown in section [ secresults ] . in section [ secdd ] we present an analysis of the ionization sources via diagnostic diagrams .",

    "a specific study of this galaxy can be found in , who concluded that its appearance most likely reflects a recent minor merger .",
    "asymmetries set up in the disk by this minor merger may well be the cause of the intense star formation in the inner region , which can be interpreted as a rare example of a nuclear ring in a non - barred galaxy . rather than being induced by the secular evolution of a bar , this nuclear ring would then be the direct result of an interaction event in the recent history of the galaxy",
    ". it also shows a disturbed velocity field in its h@xmath0  kinematics , which may be partly the result of spiral density wave streaming motions . the hi emission , although faint , also shows disturbed morphology and kinematics .",

    "the distance to this galaxy is uncertain , ranging from 8.4 mpc to 14.5 mpc @xcite .",
    "we adopt a distance of 9.8 mpc , given by a more recent work @xcite , for which 1  corresponds to 47.5 pc . + it has a clear knotty structure not organized into spiral arms , with a complete absence of any well - defined arms in h@xmath0  emission , and a flocculent appearance of the disk s innermost regions @xcite .",

    "+ radial metallicity and reddening gradients , both decreasing with the galactocentric distance , are found from studies of h@xmath0  emitting regions by @xcite , a trend often observed in spirals .",
    "+ the hi velocity dispersion ( ranging 4  15 ) also decreases with radius , but the decline of starlight with radius is much steeper than that of the velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "these authors also find that the hi velocity dispersion is not correlated with star formation or the spiral arms , so a global radial falloff must be explained in the context of significant local effects .",

    "two faint spiral arms can be distinguished , while the stronger emission comes from the nuclear region and some very compact and clumpy sources at the end of the southern spiral arm or across the northern one .",
    "+ no specific studies for this galaxy are found in the literature , but it is included in many surveys for different purposes , e.g. @xcite who study the nuclear star clusters in late - type spiral galaxies . in this work ,",
    "ugc  3574 is characterized as having a  naked \" nuclear cluster in the i - band wfpc2 image , forming a distinct and isolated entity within the disk and without any signs of a kinematic centre . *",

    "+ these features are enhanced in h@xmath0  emission , as can be observed in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the h@xmath0  image is taken from the public database of the local volume legacy ( lvl ) survey , and is over - plotted to the hst image , in flux scaled contours .",
    "we obtained long - slit spectroscopy with the double arm isis spectrograph attached to the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) , at the roque de los muchachos observatory ( la palma ) during december 2003 .",
    "this instrument consists of two intermediate dispersion spectrographs operating simultaneously , separating the blue and red spectral regions , which are imaged onto an eev12 and a marconi2 ccd chip , respectively . in this way we have two spectral ranges observed simultaneously , a blue one centred around h@xmath11 ( 4861  ) , and a red one around h@xmath0  ( 6563  ) .",
    "the gratings used , r1200r and r600b , provide a dispersion of 0.23 and 0.45  / pixel respectively .",
    "the slit width of 1 arcsec projects onto about 3.64 pixels full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) on the detector ; the spatial sampling along the slit is 0.2 arcsec / pixel .",
    "the slit was placed at two or three different position angles for each galaxy ( table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "an angle close to the minor axis of the galaxy was chosen , so the projection of the rotation velocity is nearly negligible and the observed velocities are mainly the projected vertical component on the line of sight .",
    "moreover , other intermediate angles were taken to compare corrugated patterns with the latter , and/or to cross some brighter h@xmath0  features .",
    "the spectra were reduced and calibrated following the standard procedure .",
    "bias subtraction , flat - fielding , wavelength and flux calibration were done with the iraf task ccdproc . for the wavelength calibration cune",
    "@xmath12 cuar lamps were used .",
    "the standard stars feige 34 , g191b2b , gd248 , gd50 and hz21 from the oke ( 1990 ) catalogue were used for flux calibration .",
    "sky subtraction was done using the iraf noao package task background . for each wavelength range , the different exposures at each slit orientation were combined , eliminating cosmic rays and bad pixels , thus obtaining the final spectra .",
    "the observed velocity along the slit is obtained from the h@xmath0  emission line fitting . moreover , to calculate the diagnostic diagrams to study the ionization ( section [ secdd ] ) , we fit the emission lines h@xmath0 , [ nii ] , [ sii ] , h@xmath11 , and [ oiii ] , with a gaussian at each pixel along the slit where the emission was strong enough to be fitted .",

[ tab3 ]    as a first approximation , we consider a global velocity model where the main movement in the galactic plane is the rotational velocity , neglecting any other kind of kinematics , and it is assumed that they depend on the galactocentric distance or radius , @xmath14 .",
    "we try to explain those movements that do not fit to the model as vertical motions with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "the observed velocities @xmath15 are obtained from the h@xmath0  emission line fitting of the long - slit spectra , described in section [ secobs ] above .",
    "data for the calculation of the rotation curves @xmath14 , inclination angles and pas for each galaxy are taken from @xcite , see table [ tab1 ] .",
    "rotation curves data are given as a set of points with their errors ( figure [ fig2 ] ) , so the rotation curves are obtained by fitting these sets of points using the parametric model of @xcite ,    @xmath16    where @xmath17 regulates the overall amplitude of the rotation curve , @xmath18 yields a scale length for the inner steep rise , and @xmath0 sets the slope of the slowly changing outer part . after a least square fit of this model to the data , the parameters obtained for each galaxy are summarized in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the rotation curve fitted to the data of each galaxy .",
    "the approaching side of the curve is represented by grey circles and the receding side by black squares .",
    "both sides of the curve were fitted separately , represented with dashed and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "the kinematic lopsidedness commonly observed in the dynamics of galaxies can be clearly seen .",
    "this lopsidedness occurs in two different ways , as already described by , who found five different types for the kinematic behaviour of disk galaxies based on the rotation curves of the receding and approaching sides separately .",
    "ngc  278 shows their third type , in which receding and approaching sides agree well at small radii but differ at large radii , whereas the other three galaxies show type 5 , in which the curves of receding and approaching sides change sides at a certain radius .",
    "despite this lopsidedness , the rotation curves were fitted to both receding and approaching points as a whole data set , given by the bold line in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "this global fit remains at intermediate values between the rotation curves of the receding and approaching sides , as a combination of both sides .",
    "finally , as @xmath19 is expressed as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 are consider part of our data ) , we can calculate its uncertainty by propagating the error as : @xmath24             figure [ fig3 ] shows the procedure for obtaining the vertical motions for the galaxy ngc  278 , at each of the three position angles .",
    "the top panels show the observed radial velocities @xmath15 with their error bars , together with the projection of the rotation curve @xmath25 ( the bold line ) fitted as described above .",
    "the systemic velocity @xmath26 is marked by a black - filled circle .",
    "all these plots have the galactocentric distance in the @xmath27-axis , where zero distance marks the galactic centre position .",
    "the h@xmath0  emission line flux is also plotted , with the aim of looking for some relation or correlation between the velocity and flux peaks .",
    "the middle panels show that @xmath19 has some residual trend , as residual of the rotational velocity removal probably due to the described lopsidedness .",
    "to remove these rotational residues , the vertical velocity component has been detrended , hereafter denoted as @xmath28 , by fitting a linear component to the gentle rise for each rotation curve side , the approaching and the receding sides . in this simple way , the residual trend from the difference between the approaching and the receding sides of the rotation curve is removed ; and thus only the local fluctuations , or oscillations , of the vertical velocity component across the disk , throughout the spiral arms and for different slit positions , remain .",
    "the bottom panels show the detrended velocities @xmath28 .",
    "the same procedure is applied for the rest of the galaxies , although , for the sake of clarity , only the observed velocities ( on the top panels ) and the final detrended vertical velocities ( on the bottom ) are shown in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] . in the next section",
    "we describe a more detailed analysis or description of the morphologies or patterns found from these plots for each galaxy .",
    "in this section we describe the deviations from the main rotation observed , @xmath28 , which we interpret as perpendicular motions of the ionized gas from the galactic disk , or corrugations .",
    "the aim is to show the existence of such corrugations in galaxies , as well as giving a description of its morphologies or patterns .",
    "we found the maxima and minima values of @xmath28 are usually related with h@xmath0  emission line peaks , and with the morphology of the galaxy .",
    "its interpretation is still an open matter of discussion .    for ngc  278 and ngc  1058 a wavelike structure of @xmath28 , along the whole slit , is clearer than for the other two galaxies . in ngc  2500 and",
    "ugc  3574 there are some regions with no h@xmath0  emission or too faint to be fitted , and consequently there is no @xmath28 associated with these regions .",
    "this last feature is more remarkable in ugc  3574 , the most distant galaxy of the sample , losing therefore a global view of the vertical velocity deviations with respect to the h@xmath0  emission ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .    in a previous study for the corrugated velocities in ngc  5427",
    ", @xcite found a systematic spatial shift between the velocity peaks , @xmath28 , and the emission line intensity peaks of h@xmath0 ; where the approaching ( negative values ) peaks of @xmath28 occur in the convex border of the arms , and the receding ( positive values ) maxima are located behind the h@xmath0  emission maxima , in the concave side .",
    "this kinematical behaviour is interpreted as the response of the gas flow into a spiral density wave in a thick and magnetized gaseous disk , described by the @xcite and @xcite galactic bore models .    for each slit in all galaxies ,",
    "we find some of these features of the variation of the vertical motions when the slit passes through spiral arms , but with a varied phenomenology .    in ngc  278 , the behaviour described by @xcite is clearly observed for the slit pa = 40.5@xmath29 , between galactocentric distances @xmath30 and @xmath31 kpc , with @xmath32  ( figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this feature is in the concave side of the spiral arm , since it is located within the corotation radius ( @xmath33 kpc , @xcite ) .",
    "the gas reaches the density wave behind the spiral arm border -or concave side- , so the approaching ( negative values ) peak in @xmath28 occurs behind the h@xmath0  emission maxima , or the corresponding spiral arm , when the gas is flowing up to higher galactic latitudes above the arm .",
    "then it falls down onto the galactic plane , which corresponds to the receding maxima ( positive values ) in @xmath28 that appear ahead of the arm .",
    "this phenomenon is also observable , although for fainter h@xmath0  emission maxima , and close to the corotation radius , between galactocentric distances @xmath34 and @xmath35 kpc , with high vertical @xmath36 , and around @xmath37 kpc with @xmath38 .",
    "another interpretation for the approaching and receding peaks in @xmath28 could be the deceleration and acceleration with respect to the rotation velocity .",
    "if this were the case , the observed velocities would be represented by @xmath39 .",
    "if the vertical motions were neglected , the associated variation in the observed velocities of @xmath40   can not be explained by the difference between the rotation velocities .",
    "an even more outstanding example is found for the slit pa = 143.5@xmath29 , the minor axis .",
    "the most important peak in this case shows a variation in the observed velocities between galactocentric distances 0.5 and 0.8 kpc .",
    "a @xmath41   can not be explained by the difference between the rotation velocities @xmath42 . on the other hand , if the @xmath28 were not considered and with a projection factor of @xmath43 , for a @xmath44 of @xmath45  a difference for the rotation velocity of the order of 2400  would be required .",
    "this would imply a velocity radial gradient @xmath46 / no sense in a galactic disk and radial distances of 300 pc .    with our data and resolution",
    "we can not discern if this is the case of a bubble in expansion or a merger , as the process that would explain such behaviour in @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , this feature at pa @xmath47 is found as the largest vertical displacement , whereas it does not seem to be related with a significant h@xmath0  emission peak .",
    "however , we can not claim that it is not related with a spiral arm , since the weakness of h@xmath0  emission does not determine the presence of a spiral arm .    at slit pa@xmath48 , between @xmath49 and @xmath50 kpc ( close to corotation )",
    ", we can identify a double @xmath28 peak associated with h@xmath0  emission peaks .",
    "so its interpretation in the framework of @xcite is not clear .",
    "although this is a quite plausible model , with the current data , we can not discard other mechanisms as the origin or contributing to the enhancement of the corrugations in the velocity field .",
    "similar patterns can be observed in the rest of the galaxies . in some locations ,",
    "it is possible to discern similar behaviour to that expected from a galactic bore .",
    "for many others , the mechanism behind it is not clear .",
    "however , the changes in @xmath28 are still clearly seen , as it crosses a spiral arm ( as identified by the h@xmath0  peaks ) , from the receding to the approaching side , or vice versa .",
    "so these changes in @xmath28 are definitely related to the spiral arms .",
    "some examples of such patterns are found , for example in ngc  2500 , between @xmath51 and @xmath52 kpc at pa@xmath53 , @xmath28 goes from @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "again , just after the spiral arm , the gas flows up to nearly @xmath56 . at pa@xmath57 ,",
    "in the central part of the slit , @xmath28 are more pronounced but they are also noisier due to the faint h@xmath0 . the stronger h@xmath0  emission peaks are at the ends of the slit , where we can observe the pattern described above , around @xmath52 and @xmath58 kpc , respectively . at pa@xmath59 , close to the minor axis , this is observed between @xmath60 and @xmath61 kpc , where the gas flows up from @xmath56 to @xmath62 . between the two arms there is a similar change in @xmath28 from @xmath54 to @xmath56 . as in the previous pa , there is a weaker and noisier zone between @xmath52 and @xmath37 kpc , but the corrugations are still observable .    in ngc  1058 , for pa@xmath63 and around the corotation radius at @xmath35 kpc ,",
    "there is another example of @xmath28 across the spiral arm . in the opposite side of the slit , between @xmath64 and @xmath65 kpc , just before the spiral arm there is an important change of @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "another example of the pattern we are describing as similar to a galactic bore is found at pa@xmath68 , between @xmath37 and @xmath64 kpc , just before the arm ( around @xmath37 kpc ) where there is a large vertical deviation . at this",
    "pa the h@xmath0  emission is bright enough that peaks have been measured continuously , and so corrugations are more noticeable .",
    "ugc  3574 is the farthest galaxy of the sample , therefore the h@xmath0  emission is fainter and more difficult to measure along the slit ( figure [ fig5 ] ) . nevertheless , the vertical velocity deviations are appreciable and these seem to be linked to the spiral arms . at pa@xmath69 , between @xmath70",
    "to @xmath71 kpc and @xmath37 to @xmath65 kpc we can see how the @xmath28 changes across the spiral arms .    in summary , we found in some cases that it is easy to see how @xmath28 changes across the arm , quite similar to the pattern described by @xcite , and it could be explained by galactic bore models .",
    "but in many other cases , @xmath28 changes are shifted , or they become wider , or lengthened beyond the arm . that is , there are other features where the expected pattern for this model is not so clear or is not observed . in some cases , an important vertical displacement @xmath28 does not seem to be related with an h@xmath0  emission peak , as for example the feature described above at pa @xmath47 in ngc  278 or between @xmath30 and @xmath72  at pa @xmath57 in ngc  2500 .",
    "our analysis establishes the existence of a vertical velocity field that shows a sinusoidal structure associated mainly with the observed spiral arms . how can the generation of these structures be explained ? since the 1970s",
    ", different models have been proposed to explain the genesis of the spatial corrugations observed in our galaxy and other external galaxies ( see @xcite for a review of this topic to that date ) .",
    "but , regarding the variations of the vertical velocity field , the first article that took the possible corrugation of velocities into consideration was published by @xcite , for the galaxy ngc  5427 , in which the hydraulic bore mechanism @xcite was proposed for the formation of the velocity field observed in the vicinity of the spiral arms .",
    "the choice of this model , for comparison with the observations of the velocity field of ngc 5427 , was determined by it being the only model that predicted the expected velocity structure in the neighbourhood of spiral arms , and therefore the only one that made it possible to perform the comparison . moreover ,",
    "both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the model fitted with the velocity field observed .",
    "the situation has not changed much over the last decade , and few models of the galaxy , if any , incorporate corrugations into their description . yet , what is the principal ingredient that makes the models proposed by the wisconsin group ( and successors ) different to the rest ?",
    "the answer is simple : the magnetic field .",
    "the majority of models prior to the one proposed by @xcite are based on the interaction between different galactic subsystems ( like discs and halos ) , and the impact of the disc with high - velocity clouds ( whether hi or dark matter ) , and do not include the magnetic field in their physical fundamentals  with the exception of @xcite on the impact with hvcs , and those on the parker instability for the generation of super - clouds and corrugations in spiral arms ( i.e. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "should we include the magnetic field in the physical foundations of any model that tries to explain the observed corrugations ?",
    "our answer is yes , and there are two types of arguments that back this affirmation : a ) there is a non - negligible magnetic field in our galaxy ; and b ) in the evolutionary models of the galactic interstellar medium , the inclusion of the galactic magnetic field is far from being irrelevant @xcite .",
    "to complement the kinematic analysis , diagnostic diagrams ( dd ) are included to study the ionization structure in the observed features .",
    "as it is well known , the ionization and excitation process can be determined by plots of [ nii]/h@xmath0  versus [ oiii]/h@xmath11 , depending on its location in such diagrams @xcite .",
    "these ratios are the best options among all the possible emission line ratios @xcite , and therefore one of the most commonly and widely used dd .    before plotting the dd ,",
    "the flux ratios are corrected for reddening following the relation    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the unreddened emission at a certain wavelength from the source , and @xmath75 is the observed flux , affected by dust absorption .",
    "@xmath76 is the extinction factor at a particular waveband @xmath77 , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the extinction curve and the absorption in the v band , respectively . the balmer decrement is a method for reddening correction , deduced from the comparison of the observed h@xmath0  to h@xmath11 flux ratio with the theoretical value of @xmath80 @xcite , based on case b recombination . applying the balmer decrement we have that ,    @xmath81",
    "so , the unreddened flux ratios can be obtained as    @xmath82    where @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "the dd for each galaxy are found in figures [ fig6 ] to [ fig9 ] , together with the plots of @xmath85 .",
    "plotted individually , they have a better resolution than the above plots of @xmath85 in figures [ fig3]@xmath86[fig5 ] . to include more robust information , only those pixels with @xmath28 less than the mean of the errors",
    "@xmath87 are plotted .",
    "so they clearly show the relationship between the velocity and the h@xmath0  emission line flux peaks .",
    "the different slit position angles for each galaxy are represented with different symbols and grey colour scale , as indicated in the figures .",
    "the locations where the dd ratios are above the reference line for photoionization by young stars are shown in the panels with the @xmath85 kinematics .",
    "this could provide some clues as to whether the ionization mechanism is related to the presence of corrugations and the encounter of the density wave with a spiral arm . within the galactic bore model framework @xcite",
    ", we would expect the presence of shocks at these locations .",
    "no concluding results are obtained from the dd , which show that photoionization by young massive stars seems to be the main ionization mechanism in most locations .",
    "there is only a small portion of the gas that appears to be ionized by low - velocity shocks . in ngc  278 and in ngc  1058 , at pa@xmath88 , this portion is more important . in ngc  278 , for example , these low - velocity shocks would be located in the innermost central , coinciding with the minor merger found by .",
    "moreover , two different forms of behaviour appear in the [ nii]/h@xmath0  _ vs. _ [ oiii]/h@xmath11 diagnostic diagrams .",
    "ngc  278 and ngc  1058 have most of their pixels , for the three slit positions , concentrated at the same location in the dd , whereas for ngc  2500 and ugc  3574 different slit positions occupy a different location in the dd , nearly covering the theoretical curve separating the different ionization mechanisms .",
    "this behaviour may be related to a metallicity gradient , but a more detailed study , beyond the scope of this paper , would be needed .    in summary , although the association between the gas ionization mechanisms and kinematic properties do not offer a conclusive pattern , some general characteristics are observed : a ) most of the gas is ionized by high - energy photons ; and b ) in ngc 278 and ngc 1058 there is a not negligible number of points whose diagnostic diagram suggests ionization through low - velocity shocks . in ngc 278",
    "these shocks seem particularly limited to the central region where some authors have observed signs of an inner merger . otherwise , we note the potential to explore this idea further with the integral field spectroscopic data sets that are becoming available , such as from the surveys califa , manga @xcite , and sami @xcite , and with much better resolution from data already becoming available from the muse instrument at the vlt @xcite .",
    "in this work we extend the detection and study of kinematic corrugations , already reported in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , to a small sample of face on spirals .",
    "the galaxies studied here show a similar behaviour to ngc  5427 @xcite at some locations , with a clear displacement between the velocity and the emission line peaks , where the approaching peaks of @xmath28 occur in the convex side of the spiral arms , and the receding maxima are located behind the h@xmath0  flux maxima , in the concave side .",
    "this kinematical pattern is similar to the one expected in a galactic bore generated by the interaction of a spiral density wave with a thick magnetized gaseous disk .    in locations where",
    "@xmath28 peaks are found to be related to h@xmath0  emission maxima , a strong velocity gradient crossing the arm is sometimes observed , as seen in figures [ fig6 ] to [ fig9 ] , and described in section [ secresults ] .",
    "this relation is not so clear in ngc  2500 and ugc  3574 .",
    "however , in these galaxies the h@xmath0  emission is much fainter , and the h@xmath0  emission line could only be fitted in a limited number of points along the slit .",
    "this produces a bias , and no clear conclusions can be deduced for these two galaxies .    in ngc  278 , at pa=143.5@xmath29 there is a strong @xmath28 peak in a weak h@xmath0  emission zone .",
    "this could be associated with corotation or with a recent merger in the inner disk .",
    "we have checked that the stronger velocity peaks do not necessarily coincide with the stronger emission line intensity peaks .    from the analysis of the ionized emission line diagnostic diagrams ,",
    "we conclude that photoionization by young stars is the main mechanism , and only a small portion of the gas appear to be ionized by alternative mechanisms , such as low velocity shocks . in this dd",
    "we see different behaviour for the two galaxies ngc  278 and ngc  1058 on one hand , and ngc  2500 and ugc  3574 on the other hand .",
    "the former have most of the pixels concentrated at the same location of the dd , whereas for the latter they are distributed covering more of the parameter space along the theoretical curve separating the different ionization mechanisms .",
    "this may be understood as a consequence of metallicity gradients , but further investigations are warranted .",
    "the origin of kinematic corrugations is still a matter of debate .",
    "corrugations are closely linked , as cause - effect , to the large scale star formation processes : density waves , tidal interactions , collisions of high velocity clouds with disk , or a galactic bore generated by the interaction of a spiral density wave with a thick gaseous disk , etc .",
    "which mechanism is the origin of disk gas corrugations is still an open question .",
