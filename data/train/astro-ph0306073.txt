    "this inverse - compton scattering preferentially boosts the energy of a scattered cmb photon , causing a small ( @xmath3 mk ) distortion in the cmb spectrum , known as the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite .",
    "the sze is proportional to the pressure integrated along the line of sight , @xmath4 .",
    "x - ray emission from the icm has a different dependence on the density @xmath5 , where  is the x - ray cooling function .",
    "taking advantage of the different density dependences and with some assumptions about the geometry of the cluster , the distance to the cluster may be determined .",
    "sze and x - ray determined distances are independent of the extragalactic distance ladder and provide distances to high - redshift galaxy clusters .",
    "this method does not rely on clusters being standard candles or rulers and relies only on relatively simple properties of highly ionized plasma .",
    "the promise of direct distances has been one of the primary motivations for sze observations .",
    "efforts over the first two decades after the sze was first proposed in 1970 @xcite yielded few reliable detections . over the last decade ,",

    "in addition , the sze has been used to measure gas fractions in galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , which can be used to measure the matter density of the universe , @xmath7 , assuming the composition of clusters represents a fair sample of the universal composition .",
    "upcoming deep , large - scale sze surveys will measure the evolution of the number density of galaxy clusters , which is critically dependent on the underlying cosmology . in principle , the equation of state of the `` dark energy '' may be determined from the evolution of the number density of clusters .    in this review ,",

    "the sze is a small spectral distortion of the cmb spectrum caused by the scattering of the cmb photons off a distribution of high - energy electrons .",
    "we only consider the sze caused by the hot thermal distribution of electrons provided by the icm of galaxy clusters .",
    "cmb photons passing through the center of a massive cluster have a @xmath8 probability of interacting with an energetic icm electron .",
    "the resulting inverse - compton scattering preferentially boosts the energy of the cmb photon , causing a small ( @xmath3 mk ) distortion in the cmb spectrum . to illustrate the small effect ,",
    "figure  [ fig : sze_cmb ] shows the sze spectral distortion for a fictional cluster that is over 1000 times more massive than a typical cluster .",
    "the sze appears as a decrease in the intensity of the cmb at frequencies below @xmath9 ghz and as an increase at higher frequencies .",
    "the sze spectral distortion of the cmb , expressed as a temperature change @xmath10 at dimensionless frequency @xmath11 , is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the compton @xmath13-parameter , which for an isothermal cluster equals the optical depth times the fractional energy gain per scattering . here , @xmath14 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath15 is the electron number density , @xmath16 is the electron temperature , @xmath17 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath18 is the electron rest - mass energy , and the integration is along the line of sight .",

    "it is worth noting that @xmath22 is independent of redshift , as shown in equation  [ eq : deltat1 ] .",
    "this unique feature of the sze makes it a potentially powerful tool for investigating the high - redshift universe .",

    "the spectral distortion of the cmb spectrum by the thermal sze is shown in figure  [ fig : sze_di - dt ] ( solid line ) for a realistic massive cluster ( @xmath28 ) , in units of intensity ( left panel ) and rj brightness temperature ( right panel ) . the rj brightness is shown because the sensitivity of a radio telescope is calibrated in these units .",
    "it is defined simply by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the intensity at frequency @xmath31 , @xmath17 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath32 is the speed of light .",
    "the cmb blackbody spectrum , @xmath33 , multiplied by 0.0005 ( dotted line ) , is also shown for comparison .",
    "note that the spectral signature of the thermal effect is distinguished readily from a simple temperature fluctuation of the cmb .",
    "the kinetic sze distortion is shown by the dashed curve (  [ sec : kinetic_sze ] ) . in the nonrelativistic regime , it is indistinguishable from a cmb temperature fluctuation .",
    "the gas temperatures measured in massive galaxy clusters are around @xmath34 kev @xcite and are measured to be as high as @xmath35 kev in the galaxy cluster 1e @xmath36 @xcite . at these temperatures , electron velocities are becoming relativistic , and small corrections are required for accurate interpretation of the sze .",
    "there has been considerable theoretical work to include relativistic corrections to the sze @xcite .",
    "all of these derivations agree for @xmath37 kev , appropriate for galaxy clusters . for a massive cluster with @xmath38 kev ( @xmath39 ) , the relativistic corrections to the sze",
    "are of order a few percent in the rj portion of the spectrum , but can be substantial near the null of the thermal effect .",
    "convenient analytical approximations to fifth order in @xmath40 are presented in @xcite .",
    "the measured sze spectrum of abell 2163 , spanning the decrement and increment with data obtained from different telescopes and techniques , is shown in figure  [ fig : a2163_spec ] @xcite .",
    "also plotted is the best - fit model ( solid ) consisting of thermal ( dashed ) and kinetic ( dotted ) sze components .",
    "the sze spectrum is a good fit to the data , demonstrating the consistency and robustness of modern sze measurements .",
    "the most important features of the thermal sze are : ( 1 ) it is a small spectral distortion of the cmb , of order @xmath41 mk , which is proportional to the cluster pressure integrated along the line of sight ( eq .  [ eq : y ] ) ; ( 2 ) it is independent of redshift ; and ( 3 ) it has a unique spectral signature with a decrease in the cmb intensity at frequencies @xmath9 ghz and an increase at higher frequencies .",
    "if the cluster is moving with respect to the cmb rest frame , there will be an additional spectral distortion due to the doppler effect of the cluster bulk velocity on the scattered cmb photons .",
    "if a component of the cluster velocity , @xmath42 , is projected along the line of sight to the cluster , then the doppler effect will lead to an observed distortion of the cmb spectrum , referred to as the kinetic sze . in the nonrelativistic limit ,",
    "the spectral signature of the kinetic sze is a pure thermal distortion of magnitude @xmath43 where @xmath42 is along the line of sight ; that is , the emergent spectrum is still described completely by a planck spectrum , but at a slightly different temperature , lower ( higher ) for positive ( negative ) peculiar velocities @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sze_di - dt ] illustrates the kinetic sze ( dashed ) for a typical galaxy cluster with a peculiar velocity of 500 @xmath44 .",
    "figure  [ fig : a2163_spec ] shows the sze spectrum of the galaxy cluster a2163 along with the best - fit model consisting of thermal ( dashed ) and kinetic ( dotted ) sze components .",
    "relativistic perturbations to the kinetic sze are due to the lorentz boost to the electrons provided by the bulk velocity @xcite .",
    "the leading term is of order @xmath45 , and for a 10  kev cluster moving at 1000  the effect is about an 8% correction to the nonrelativistic term .",
    "the @xmath46 term is only about 1% of the nonrelativistic kinetic sze , and the @xmath47 term is only 0.2% .      in the 20 years following the first papers by sunyaev & zeldovich ( 1970 , 1972 ) , there were few firm detections of the sze despite a considerable amount of effort ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review of early experiments ) .",
    "over the last several years , however , observations of the effect have progressed from low signal - to - noise ratio detections and upper limits to high - confidence detections and detailed images . in this section",
    "we briefly review the current state of sze observations .",
    "the dramatic increase in the quality of the observations is due to improvements both in low - noise detection systems and in observing techniques , usually using specialized instrumentation to control carefully the systematics that often prevent one from obtaining the required sensitivity .",
    "the sensitivity of a low - noise radio receiver available 20 years ago should have easily allowed the detection of the sze toward a massive cluster .",
    "most attempts , however , failed due to uncontrolled systematics .",
    "now that the sensitivities of detector systems have improved by factors of 3 to 10 , it is clear that the goal of all modern sze instruments is the control of systematics .",
    "such systematics include , for example , the spatial and temporal variations in the emission from the atmosphere and the surrounding ground , as well as gain instabilities inherent to the detector system used .",
    "the observations must be conducted on the appropriate angular scales .",
    "galaxy clusters have a characteristic size scale of order a mpc . for a reasonable cosmology ,",
    "a mpc subtends an arcminute or more at any redshift .",
    "low - redshift clusters will subtend a much larger angle ; for example , the angular extent of the coma cluster ( @xmath48 ) is of order a degree ( core radius @xmath49 ; herbig et al .",
    "the detection of extended low - surface brightness objects requires precise differential measurements made toward widely separated directions on the sky .",
    "the large angular scale presents challenges to control offsets due to differential ground pick - up and atmospheric variations .",
    "there are three main sources of astronomical contamination and confusion that must be considered when observing the sze : ( 1 ) cmb primary anisotropies , ( 2 ) radio point sources , and ( 3 ) dust from the galaxy and external galaxies .",
    "for distant clusters with angular extents of a few arcminutes or less , the cmb anisotropy is expected @xcite and found to be damped considerably on these scales ( @xcite ; see also holzapfel et al .",
    "1997b and laroque et al .",
    "2003 for cmb limits to sze contamination ) . for nearby clusters , or for searches for distant clusters using beams larger than a few arcminutes , the intrinsic cmb anisotropy must be considered .",
    "the unique spectral behavior of the thermal sze can be used to separate it from the intrinsic cmb in these cases .",
    "note , however , that for such cases it will not be possible to separate the kinetic sze effects from the intrinsic cmb anisotropy without relying on the very small spectral distortions of the kinetic sze due to relativistic effects .",
    "historically , the major source of contamination in the measurement of the sze has been radio point sources .",
    "it is obvious that emission from point sources located along the line of the sight to the cluster could fill in the sze decrement , leading to an underestimate .",
    "radio point sources can also lead to overestimates of the sze decrement  for example , point sources in the reference fields of single - dish observations .",
    "the radio point sources are variable and therefore must be monitored .",
    "radio emission from the cluster member galaxies , from the central dominant ( cd ) galaxy in particular , is often the largest source of radio point source contamination , at least at high radio frequencies @xcite .    at frequencies near the null of the thermal sze and higher , dust emission from extragalactic sources as well as dust emission from our own galaxy must be considered . at the angular scales and frequencies of interest for most sze observations , contamination from diffuse galactic dust emission",
    "will not usually be significant and is easily compensated .",
    "consider instead the dusty extragalactic sources such as those that have been found toward massive galaxy clusters with the scuba bolometer array @xcite .",
    "spectral indices for these sources are estimated to be @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "sources with 350  ghz ( 850  @xmath51 m ) flux densities greater than 8  mjy are common , and all clusters surveyed had multiple sources with flux densities greater than 5  mjy .",
    "this translates into an uncertainty in the peculiar velocity for a galaxy cluster of roughly 1000 @xmath44 ( see @xcite for details ) .    as with sze observations at radio frequencies",
    ", the analyses of high - frequency observations must also consider the effects of point sources and require either high dynamic angular range , large spectral coverage , or both to separate the point source emission from the sze .",
    "the first measurements of the sze were made with single - dish radio telescopes at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "advances in detector technology made the measurements possible , although early observations appear to have been plagued by systematic errors that led to irreproducible and inconsistent results .",
    "eventually , successful detections using beam - switching techniques were obtained . during this period , the pioneering work of birkinshaw and collaborators with the ovro 40  m telescope stands out for its production of results that served to build confidence in the technique @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ovro40m_cl0016 ] shows the ovro 40  m scan through the galaxy cluster cl @xmath52 .",
    "more recently , leading and trailing beam - switching techniques have been used successfully with the ovro 5  m telescope at 32 ghz to produce reliable detections of the sze in several intermediate - redshift clusters @xcite .",
    "the sest 15  m and iram 30  m telescopes have been used with bolometric detectors at 140 ghz and chopping mirrors to make significant detections of the sze in several clusters @xcite .",
    "the nobeyama 45  m telescope has also been been used at 21 , 43 , and 150  ghz to detect and map the sze @xcite .",
    "the sunyaev - zeldovich infrared experiment ( suzie ) uses its six - element 140 ghz bolometer array to observe in a drift - scanning mode , where the telescope is fixed and the rotation of the earth moves the beams across the sky . using this drift - scanning technique , the suzie experiment has produced high signal - to - noise ratio strip maps of the sze emission in several clusters @xcite .    because of the high sensitivity of bolometric detectors at millimeter wavelengths , single - dish experiments are ideally suited for the measurement of the sze spectrum . by observing at several millimeter frequencies , these instruments should be able to separate the thermal and kinetic szes from atmospheric fluctuations and sources of astrophysical confusion .",
    "the measured sze spectrum of abell 2163 , spanning the decrement and increment with data obtained from different telescopes and techniques , is shown in figure  [ fig : a2163_spec ] @xcite .",
    "the sze spectrum is a good fit to the data , demonstrating the consistency and robustness of modern sze measurements .",
    "single - dish observations of the sze are just beginning to reach their potential , and the future is very promising .",
    "the development of large - format , millimeter - wavelength bolometer arrays will increase the mapping speed of current sze experiments by orders of magnitude . to the extent that atmospheric fluctuations are common across a bolometric array",
    ", it will be possible to realize the intrinsic sensitivity of the detectors .",
    "operating from high astronomical sites with stable atmospheres and exceptionally low precipitable water vapor , future large - format bolometer arrays have the potential to produce high signal - to - noise ratio sze images and search for distant sze clusters with unprecedented speed .",
    "the stability and spatial filtering inherent to interferometry has been exploited to make high - quality images of the sze .",
    "the stability of an interferometer is due to its ability to perform simultaneous differential sky measurements over well - defined spatial frequencies .",
    "the spatial filtering of an interferometer also allows the emission from radio point sources to be separated from the sze emission .",
    "there are several other features that allow an interferometer to achieve extremely low systematics .",
    "for example , only signals that correlate between array elements will lead to detected signal . for most interferometers",
    ", this means that the bulk of the sky noise for each element will not lead to signal .",
    "amplifier gain instabilities for an interferometer will not lead to large offsets or false detections , although , if severe , they may lead to somewhat noisy signal amplitude . to remove the effects of offsets or drifts in the electronics , as well as the correlation of spurious ( noncelestial ) sources of noise , the phase of the signal received at each telescope is modulated , and then the proper demodulation is applied to the output of the correlator .",
    "the spatial filtering of an interferometer also allows the emission from radio point sources to be separated from the sze emission .",
    "this is possible because at high angular resolution ( @xmath53 ) the sze contributes very little flux .",
    "this allows one to use long baselines , which give high angular resolution , to detect and monitor the flux of radio point sources , while using short baselines to measure the sze .",
    "nearly simultaneous monitoring of the point sources is important , as they are often time variable .",
    "the signal from the point sources is then easily removed , to the limit of the dynamic range of the instrument , from the short - baseline data , which are sensitive also to the sze .    for the reasons given above ,",
    "interferometers offer an ideal way to achieve high brightness sensitivity for extended low - surface brightness emission , at least at radio wavelengths .",
    "most interferometers , however , were not designed for imaging low - surface brightness sources .",
    "interferometers have been built traditionally to obtain high angular resolution and thus have employed large individual elements for maximum sensitivity to small - scale emission . as a result , special - purpose interferometric systems have been built for imaging the sze @xcite .",
    "all of them have taken advantage of low - noise hemt amplifiers @xcite to achieve high sensitivity .",
    "the first interferometric detection @xcite of the sze was obtained with the ryle telescope ( rt ) .",
    "the rt was built from the 5 kilometer array , consisting of eight 13 m telescopes located in cambridge , england , operating at 15  ghz with east - west configurations .",
    "five of the telescopes can be used in a compact e - w configuration for imaging of the sze @xcite .",
    "the ovro and bima sze imaging project uses 30  ghz ( 1 cm ) low - noise receivers mounted on the ovro and bima mm - wave arrays in california .",
    "they have produced sze images toward 60 clusters to date @xcite .",
    "a sample of their sze images is shown in figure  [ fig : szpanel12 ] .",
    "all contours are multiples of 2 @xmath54 of each image , and the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the synthesized beam ( psf for this deconvolution ) is shown in the lower left - hand corner of each image .",
    "figure  [ fig : szpanel12 ] also clearly demonstrates the independence of the sze on redshift .",
    "all of the clusters shown have similarly high x - ray luminosities , and , as can be seen , the strength of the sze signals are similar despite the factor of 5 in redshift .",
    "the ovro and bima arrays support two - dimensional configurations of the telescopes , including extremely short baselines , allowing good synthesized beams for imaging the sze of clusters at declinations greater than @xmath55  degrees .",
    "the rt , ovro , and bima sze observations are insensitive to the angular scales required to image low - redshift ( @xmath56 ) clusters .",
    "recently , however , the cosmic background imager ( cbi ; padin et al .",
    "2001 ) has been used to image the sze in a few nearby clusters @xcite .",
    "the cbi is composed of 13 0.9  m telescopes mounted on a common platform , with baselines spanning 1 m to 6 m. operating in 10 1  ghz channels spanning 26  36 ghz , it is sensitive to angular scales spanning 3@xmath57 to 20@xmath57 .",
    "the large field of view of the cbi , 0.75   degrees fwhm , makes it susceptible to correlated contamination from terrestrial sources ( i.e. , ground emission ) . to compensate",
    ", they have adopted the same observing strategy as for single - dish observations (  [ sec : single_dish ] ) , by subtracting from the cluster data , data from leading and trailings fields offset by @xmath5812.5 minutes in right ascension from the cluster .",
    "interferometric observations of the sze , as for single - dish observations , are just beginning to demonstrate their potential .",
    "upcoming instruments will be over an order of magnitude more sensitive .",
    "this next generation of interferometric sze instruments will conduct deep sze surveys covering tens , and possibly hundreds , of square degrees . while not as fast as planned large - format bolometric arrays , the interferometers will be able to survey deeper and provide more detailed imaging .",
    "in particular , the high resolution and deep imaging provided by future heterogeneous arrays will provide a valuable tool for investigating cluster structure and its evolution .",
    "such studies are necessary before the full potential of large sze surveys for cosmology can be realized .",
    "several years after the sze was first proposed @xcite it was recognized that the distance to a cluster could be determined with a measure of its sze and x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the distance is determined by exploiting the different density dependences of the sze and x - ray emissions .",
    "the sze is proportional to the first power of the density ; @xmath59 , where @xmath15 is the electron density , @xmath16 is the electron temperature , and @xmath60 is along the line - of - sight . the distance dependence is made explicit with the substitution @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the angular - diameter distance of the cluster .",
    "the x - ray emission is proportional to the second power of the density ; @xmath63 , where  is the x - ray cooling function .",
    "the angular - diameter distance is solved for by eliminating the electron density , yielding @xmath64 where these quantities have been evaluated along the line of sight through the center of the cluster ( subscript 0 ) and @xmath65 refers to a characteristic scale of the cluster along the line of sight , whose exact meaning depends on the density model adopted .",
    "only the characteristic scale of the cluster in the plane of the sky is measured , so one must relate the characteristic scales along the line of sight and in the plane of the sky . for detailed treatments of this calculation ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite . combined with the redshift of the cluster and the geometry of the universe , one may determine the hubble parameter , with the inverse dependences on the observables as that of @xmath62 . with a sample of galaxy clusters ,",
    "one fits the cluster distances versus redshift to the theoretical angular - diameter distance relation , with the hubble constant as the normalization ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : da ] ) .          to date",
    ", there are 41 distance determinations to 26 different galaxy clusters from analysis of sze and x - ray observations .",
    "all of these sze / x - ray distances use _ rosat _ x - ray data and model the cluster gas as a spherical isothermal @xmath66 model @xcite .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "data do not warrant a more sophisticated treatment . in figure",
    "[ fig : da ] we show all sze - determined distances from high signal - to - noise ratio sze experiments .",
    "the uncertainties shown are statistical at 68% confidence .",
    "the theoretical angular - diameter distance relation is shown for three cosmologies assuming @xmath67 @xmath68 .",
    "there are currently three homogeneously analyzed samples of clusters with sze distances : ( 1 ) a sample of seven nearby ( @xmath69 ) galaxy clusters observed with the ovro 5  m telescope ( green solid triangles ) that finds @xmath70 @xcite , ( 2 ) a sample of five intermediate - redshift ( @xmath71 ) clusters from the rt interferometer that finds @xmath72 ( cyan solid squares ) @xcite , and ( 3 ) a sample of 18 clusters with @xmath73 from interferometric observations by the ovro and bima sze imaging project , which infers @xmath74 ( blue solid stars ) @xcite .",
    "the above hubble constants assume a @xmath75 , @xmath76 cosmology , and the uncertainties are statistical followed by systematic at 68% confidence .",
    "the treatment of uncertainties varies among the three cluster samples .",
    "a fit to the ensemble of 41 sze - determined distances yields @xmath0 km s@xmath77 mpc@xmath77 for an @xmath75 , @xmath76 cosmology , where the uncertainties are statistical followed by systematic at 68% confidence . since many of the clusters are at high redshift , the best - fit hubble constant will depend on the cosmology adopted ; the best - fit hubble constant shifts to 57 km s@xmath77 mpc@xmath77 for an open @xmath75 universe , and to 54 km s@xmath77 mpc@xmath77 for a flat @xmath78 geometry .",
    "the systematic uncertainty , discussed below , clearly dominates .",
    "the systematic uncertainty is approximate because it is complicated by shared systematics between some distance determinations .",
    "for example , including multiple distance determinations to a single cluster overstresses any effects of asphericity and orientation from that galaxy cluster .",
    "statistical uncertainty includes contributions from the icm shape parameters , the electron temperature , point sources in the field , and the cooling functions , which depends on @xmath16 , metallicity , and the column density .",
    "the largest sources of statistical uncertainty are the icm shape parameters ( from model fitting ) and the x - ray determined electron temperature ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "uncertainty from model fitting is roughly 20% in the distance and is dominated by the uncertainty in the central decrement .",
    "the contribution from @xmath16 on the distances varies greatly from @xmath80% to @xmath81% , with 10%20% being typical values .",
    "as expected , nearby cluster temperatures are more precisely determined than those of distant galaxy clusters .",
    "the absolute calibration of both the sze and x - ray observations directly affects the distance determinations .",
    "in addition to the absolute calibration uncertainty from the observations , there are possible sources of systematic uncertainty that depend on the physical state of the icm and other sources that can contaminate the cluster sze emission .",
    "table  [ tab : h0_sys ] summarizes the systematic uncertainties in the hubble constant determined from 30 ghz interferometric sze observations of a sample of 18 clusters @xcite , but are typical of most sze experiments .",
    "the entries marked with asterisks are expected to average out for a large sample of clusters and include a @xmath82 factor reflecting the 18 clusters used in this work . for detailed discussions of systematics",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most clusters do not appear circular in radio , x - ray , or optical wavelengths . under the assumption of axisymmetric clusters , the combined effect of cluster asphericity and its orientation on the sky",
    "conspires to introduce a roughly @xmath83% random uncertainty in @xmath6 determined from one galaxy cluster @xcite .",
    "when one considers a large , unbiased sample of clusters , with random orientations , the errors due to imposing a spherical model are expected to cancel , resulting in a precise determination of @xmath6 .",
    "numerical simulations using triaxial @xmath66 models support this assumption @xcite .",
    "departures from isothermality in the cluster atmosphere may result in a large error in the distance determination from an isothermal analysis .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "band is fairly insensitive to temperature variations , showing a @xmath84% change in the pspc count rate for a factor of 2 change in temperature for @xmath85 kev gas @xcite .",
    "a mixture of simulations and studies of nearby clusters suggests a 10% effect on the hubble parameter due to departures from isothermality ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "clumping of the intracluster gas is a potentially serious source of systematic error in the determination of the hubble constant .",
    "unresolved clumps in an isothermal intracluster plasma will enhance the x - ray emission by a factor @xmath86 , where @xmath87 if significant substructure exists in galaxy clusters , the cluster generates more x - ray emission than expected from a uniform icm , leading to an underestimate of the angular - diameter distance ( @xmath88 ) and therefore an overestimate of the hubble parameter by a factor @xmath86 .",
    "unlike orientation bias , which averages down for a large sample of clusters , clumping must be measured in each cluster or estimated for an average cluster .",
    "there is currently no observational evidence of significant clumping in galaxy clusters .",
    "if clumping were significant and had large variations from cluster to cluster , we might expect larger scatter than is seen in the hubble diagrams from sze and x - ray distances ( fig .",
    "[ fig : da ] ) .",
    "in addition , the agreement between sze ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and x - ray ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) determined gas fractions from galaxy clusters also suggests that clumping is not a large effect .",
    "undetected point sources near the cluster mask the central decrement , causing an underestimate in the magnitude of the decrement and therefore an underestimate of the angular diameter distance .",
    "point sources in reference fields and for interferometers , the complicated synthesized beam shapes , may cause overestimates of the angular diameter distance .",
    "massize clusters typically have central dominant ( cd ) galaxies , which are often radio bright .",
    "therefore , it is likely that there is a radio point source near the center of each cluster .",
    "typical radio sources have falling spectra , roughly @xmath89 , where @xmath90 . at 30 ghz",
    ", possible undetected point sources just below the detection threshold of the observations introduce a @xmath84% uncertainty .",
    "cluster peculiar velocities with respect to the cmb introduce an additional cmb spectral distortion known as the kinetic sze ( see  [ sec : kinetic_sze ] ) . for a single isothermal cluster ,",
    "the ratio of the kinetic sze to the thermal sze is @xmath91 where @xmath42 is the peculiar velocity along the line of sight . at low frequencies ( rayleigh - jeans regime ) , @xmath92 and",
    "the kinetic sze is @xmath84% of the thermal sze .",
    "recent observational evidence suggests a typical one - dimensional rms peculiar velocity of @xmath93 @xmath44 @xcite , and recent simulations found similar results @xcite . in general , the kinetic effect is @xmath94% that of the thermal sze , except near the thermal null at @xmath95 ghz where the kinetic sze dominates ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sze_di - dt ] ) .",
    "cluster peculiar velocities are randomly distributed , so when averaged over an ensemble of clusters , the effect from peculiar velocities should cancel .",
    "cmb primary anisotropies have the same spectral signature as the kinetic sze .",
    "the effects of primary anisotropies on cluster distances depend strongly on the beam size of the sze observations and the typical angular scale of the clusters being observed ( nearby versus distant clusters ) ; the cmb effects on the inferred hubble constant should average out over an ensemble of clusters .",
    "recent bima observations provide limits on primary anisotropies on scales of a few arcminutes @xcite . on these scales ,",
    "cmb primary anisotropies are an unimportant ( @xmath3% ) source of uncertainty . for nearby clusters , or for searches for distant clusters using beams larger than a few arcminutes ,",
    "the intrinsic cmb anisotropy must be considered .",
    "the unique spectral signature of the thermal sze can be used to separate it from primary cmb anisotropy .",
    "however , it will not be possible to separate primary cmb anisotropies from the kinetic sze without relying on the very small spectral distortions of the kinetic sze due to relativistic effects .    the sze may be masked by large - scale diffuse nonthermal radio emission in clusters of galaxies , known as radio halos .",
    "if present , radio halos are located at the cluster centers , have sizes typical of galaxy clusters , and have a steep radio spectrum ( @xmath96 ; hanish 1982 ; moffet & birkinshaw 1989 ; giovannini et al .",
    "1999 ; kempner & sarazin 2001 ) . because halos are rare , little is known about their nature and origin , but they are thought to be produced by synchrotron emission from an accelerated or reaccelerated population of relativistic electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "conservative and simplistic modeling of the possible effects of these halos implies a @xmath97% overestimate on the inferred hubble parameter from radio halos @xcite .",
    "@xcite show very large array nvss contours overlaid on 30 ghz interferometric sze images , suggesting that radio halos have little impact on sze observations and therefore on sze / x - ray distances .",
    "imprecisely measured beam shapes affect the inferred central decrements and therefore affect the hubble constant . for interferometric observations ,",
    "the primary beam is determined from holography measurements .",
    "conservative and simple modeling of the effects of the primary beam suggests that the effect on the hubble constant is a few percent ( @xmath98% ) at most . in theory , this is a controllable systematic with detailed measurements of beam shape and is currently swamped by larger potential sources of systematic uncertainty .      the prospects for improving both the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the sze distances in the near future are promising .",
    "note , from equation  [ eq : dadepend ] , that the error budget in the distance determination is sensitive to the absolute calibration of the x - ray and sze observations .",
    "currently , the best absolute calibration of sze observations is @xmath99% at 68% confidence , based on observations of the brightness of the planets mars and jupiter .",
    "efforts are now underway to reduce this uncertainty to the 1% level ( 2% in ) .",
    "uncertainty in the x - ray intensity scale also adds another shared systematic .",
    "the accuracy of the _ rosat _ x - ray intensity scale is debated , but a reasonable estimate is believed to be @xmath100% . it is hoped that the calibration of the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  x - ray telescopes will greatly reduce this uncertainty .",
    "possible sources of systematic uncertainty are summarized in table  [ tab : h0_sys ] .",
    "these values come from 30 ghz interferometric sze observations and _ rosat _ data for a sample of 18 galaxy clusters @xcite , but are typical of most sze distance determinations .",
    "the largest systematic uncertainties are due to departures from isothermality , the possibility of clumping , and possible point source contamination of the sze observations ( for detailed discussion of systematics , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "_ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  are already providing temperature profiles of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the unprecedented angular resolution of _ chandra _  will provide insight into possible small - scale structures in clusters .",
    "in addition , multiwavelength studies by existing radio observatories , for example the very large array , can shed light on the residual point source contamination of the radio wavelength sze measurements .",
    "therefore , though currently at the 30% level , many of the systematics can and will be addressed through both existing x - ray and radio observatories and larger samples of galaxy clusters provided from sze surveys .",
    "the beauty of the sze and x - ray technique for measuring distances is that it is completely independent of other techniques , and that it can be used to measure distances at high redshifts directly .",
    "since the method relies on the well - understood physics of highly ionized plasmas , it should be largely independent of cluster evolution .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : da ] already provides confidence that a large survey of sze distances consisting of perhaps a few hundred clusters with redshifts extending to one and beyond would allow the technique to be used to trace the expansion history of the universe , providing a valuable independent check of the recent determinations of the geometry of the universe from type ia supernovae @xcite and cmb primary anisotropy experiments @xcite .",
    "a promising way of finding high - redshift clusters is to perform deep , large - scale sze surveys , taking advantage of the redshift independence of the sze .",
    "such surveys will provide large catalogs of galaxy clusters , many of which will be at high redshift .",
    "the redshift evolution of the number density of galaxy clusters is critically dependent on the underlying cosmology , and in principle can be used to determine the equation of state of the `` dark energy '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : dndz ] illustrates the dependence of the evolution of cluster number density on cosmology @xcite .",
    "all three cosmologies are normalized to the local cluster abundance .",
    "notice that for low-@xmath101 cosmologies , there are a significant number of galaxy clusters with @xmath102 .",
    "there are a number of dedicated sze experiments under construction that will perform deep , large - scale sze surveys . in the next few years",
    ", there are a number of interferometric approaches that should find hundreds of galaxy clusters .",
    "bolometer array based sze experiments should find roughly thousands of clusters just one year after the interferometric experiments .",
    "the following generation of bolometer array based sze experiments should measure tens of thousands of galaxy clusters on a roughly five - year time scale .",
    "the possible systematics that could affect the yields of sze surveys are presently too large to realize the full potential of a deep sze survey covering thousands of square degrees .",
    "these systematics include , for example , the uncertainties on the survey mass detection limit owing to unknown cluster structure and cluster gas evolution .",
    "these systematics can begin to be addressed through detailed follow - up observations of a moderate - area sze survey .",
    "high - resolution sze , x - ray , and weak lensing observations will provide insights into the evolution and structure of the cluster gas .",
    "numerical simulations directly compared and normalized to the sze yields should provide the necessary improvement in our understanding of the mass function .",
    "soon after it was proposed , it was realized that sze observations could yield distances to galaxy clusters when combined with x - ray data .",
    "sze / x - ray distances are independent of the extragalactic distance ladder and do not rely on clusters being standard candles or rulers .",
    "the promise of direct distances helped motivate searches for the sze in galaxy clusters .",
    "it is only in recent years that observations of the small ( @xmath3 mk ) sze signal have yielded reliable detections and imaging , mostly due to advances in observational techniques .",
    "sze / x - ray distances have progressed from distance determinations one cluster at a time to samples of tens of galaxy clusters . to date , there are 41 sze / x - ray determined distances to 26 different galaxy clusters .",
    "the combined 41 cluster distances imply a hubble parameter of @xmath103 , where the approximate uncertainties are statistical followed by systematic at 68% confidence",
    ". shared systematics between the determined distances make it difficult to determine them precisely . for example , multiple distance determinations to a single galaxy cluster overstress any asphericity and orientation effects .",
    "there are three homogeneously analyzed samples of clusters consisting of five , seven , and 18 galaxy clusters .",
    "even with these small samples , systematics clearly dominate .",
    "systematic uncertainties are approachable with current x - ray and radio observatories .",
    "sze / x - ray determined direct distances to galaxy clusters are beginning to trace out the theoretical angular - diameter distance relation .",
    "it is clear that with a large sample of galaxy clusters at high redshift , sze / x - ray distances will be able to determine the geometry of the universe .",
    "in fact , if for some ( highly unlikely ) reason there was a systematic offset with the sze / x - ray distances , the shape of the curve could still be determined and cosmological parameters inferred .",
    "the redshift independence of the sze will be exploited with surveys of large patches of sky with next generation , dedicated sze experiments .",
    "such surveys will provide large catalogs of clusters , many of which will be at high redshift ( @xmath102 ) , providing large enough samples to use sze / x - ray distances to determine both the hubble constant and the geometry of the universe .",
    "in addition , the cluster yields from deep , large - scale sze surveys are critically dependent on the cosmology , potentially allowing a determination of the equation of state of the `` dark energy . ''",
    "high - resolution sze , x - ray , and optical ( including weak lensing ) observations will provide insights into the evolution and structure of the cluster gas necessary to exploit fully the evolution in cluster yields from sze surveys ."
