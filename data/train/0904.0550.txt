    "in recent years , the study of topological order has become a common issue in condensed matter physics and quantum information theory .",
    "wen-2004,kitaev-2006,feng-2007,oshikawa-2006,bombin-2007,aguado-2008,cirac-2008 historically , this concept was proposed to describe fractional quantum hall states , @xcite which are incompressible quantum liquids with a finite energy gap to all bulk excitations .",
    "these new quantum phases of matter can not be described by a local order parameter with spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "so the discovery of fractional quantum hall effect brings great challenge to the ginzburg - landau theory , which is a corner - stone paradigm to characterize phases and phase transitions in condensed matter physics . from the viewpoint of quantum information theory , the appearance of a long - range quantum entanglement plays an essential role in the topologically ordered states .",
    "however , a general multipartite - entanglement measure that captures the most relevant physical properties is still lacking , because the number of parameters required to describe a quantum many - body state usually grows exponentially with the particle number .",
    "the topological order appears not only in the two - dimensional  fractional quantum hall states but also in one - dimensional systems , for instance , the quantum integer - spin chains . in 1983 , haldane predicted that quantum integer - spin antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains have an exotic energy gap .",
    "@xcite  later , affleck , kennedy , lieb , and tasaki ( aklt ) affleck-1987  found a family of exactly solvable integer - spin models with valence bond solid ( vbs ) ground states , and the presence of an excitation gap can be  proved rigorously . in a spin coherent state representation ,",
    "these vbs states share a striking analogy to the fractional quantum hall states .",
    "@xcite  although the two - point spin correlation decays exponentially , den nijs and rommelse @xcite  found a hidden topological order in the @xmath7 vbs state , which is characterized by non - local string order parameters . for the @xmath7 vbs state",
    ", the long - range string order and the fourfold degeneracy in an open chain can be understood as natural consequences of a hidden @xmath8  symmetry breaking .",
    "@xcite for the standard integer - spin heisenberg models , the existence of spin-@xmath9 edge states was also verified by quantum field - theory mappings @xcite  and numerical calculations sjqin-1995 , which coincide with the vbs picture of the aklt models.experimentally , the vbs  picture for @xmath7 haldane chain was supported by the electron spin resonance studies @xcite  of the compound ni(c@xmath10h@xmath11n@xmath10)@xmath10no@xmath10(clo@xmath12 ) ( nenp ) , the nmr imagining @xcite  and the magnetic neutron scattering study @xcite  of the quasi one - dimensional material y@xmath10banio@xmath13 .",
    "the one - dimensional vbs states can be represented in a matrix - product form .",
    "@xcite moreover , it was found ostlund-1995 that density matrix renormalization group @xcite ( dmrg ) , the most powerful numerical method for one - dimensional quantum systems , converges to a matrix - product wave function as its fixed point .",
    "this important observation stimulates the formulation of the numerical techniques in one dimension by using the matrix - product variational wave functions .",
    "@xcite from a quantum information perspective , the validity of the matrix - product variational ansatz depends on whether the true quantum ground states of the system obey an area law of entanglement entropy .",
    "@xcite in this sense , the vbs states are only slightly entangled because their entanglement entropies have upper bounds even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "recently , these vbs states have received considerable attentions since they provide a playground to test the proposed measures of multipartite entanglement .",
    "@xcite towards the potential applications , it was suggested that the vbs states ensure measurement - based quantum computation .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath7 vbs state of the aklt model , brennen and miyake brennen-2008 have shown that a gap - protected measurement - based quantum computation can be performed within the degenerate ground states .    in this paper",
    ", we will introduce one - dimensional translationally invariant vbs states with a built - in lie group @xmath0 and present a general method to construct their parent hamiltonians . for quantum integer spin-@xmath1 chains , we focus on two classes of vbs states .",
    "the local spin-@xmath1 states are formed by two virtual @xmath2 spin-@xmath3 variables in the first class and by two @xmath14 spinors in  the second one . to illustrate the method",
    ", we choose the @xmath7 fermionic vbs state with virtual spin @xmath15 as an explicit example to find the parent hamiltonian .",
    "apart from the @xmath7 vbs state with virtual spin @xmath16 and the @xmath17 vbs state with virtual spin @xmath18 as the intersection elements , the vbs states of the two classes are shown to be topologically distinct to each other , which can be characterized by their edge spin representations in open chain systems .",
    "we also apply our method to investigate @xmath6 symmetric spin chains and discuss several vbs states with interesting properties .",
    "the outline of this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we will introduce vbs states with a lie group symmetry and derive their matrix product representations . in sec .",
    "iii , we will focus on quantum integer - spin chains and study two topologically distinct classes of vbs states , including spin-@xmath1 vbs states formed by virtual @xmath2 spin-@xmath3 particles and by virtual @xmath4 spinor particles .",
    "moreover , a spin-@xmath5 fermionic vbs state is extensively studied as an example and we construct its parent hamiltonian explicitly .",
    "iv is devoted to the @xmath6 symmetric vbs states and their physical properties . in sec .",
    "v , some conclusions are drawn .",
    "we begin with a quantum one - dimensional chain with @xmath19 lattice sites . in each site , the states @xmath20",
    "@xmath21 transform under a @xmath22-dimensional irreducible representation ( ir)@xmath23 of a lie group @xmath0 .",
    "let us imagine that the physical hilbert space is formed by two virtual _ identical _ particles , whose internal quantum numbers @xmath24 @xmath25 transform under the @xmath26-dimensional ir @xmath27 of the same lie group @xmath0 .",

    "the first requirement means that @xmath30 is a _ self - conjugate _",
    "ir , i.e. , the complex conjugate representation of @xmath27 is equivalent to @xmath27 .",
    "the latter requirement can be implemented by the projection operator onto the physical hilbert space @xcite @xmath31}\\left\\vert m\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\alpha , \\beta \\right\\vert , \\label{eq : projection}\\]]where @xmath32}$ ] is the clebsch - gordan coefficient defined by @xmath32}=\\langle g_{d},m|g_{d},\\alpha ; g_{d},\\beta \\rangle $ ] . for vbs states in a periodic chain ,",
    "each lattice site forms a valence - bond singlet @xmath33 with its neighboring sites by pairing two virtual particles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vbs ] ) .",
    "thus , the wave functions of the vbs states can be expressed as@xmath34where the valence - bond singlet @xmath33  is given by@xmath35here @xmath36 is the clebsch - gordan coefficient of contracting two virtual @xmath27 representations to form a singlet representation @xmath28 .    .",

    "( [ eq : vbsstate ] ) can be thus written as the following matrix - product form:@xmath41}a^{[m_{2}]}\\cdots a^{[m_{n}]})\\left\\vert m_{1}\\cdots m_{n}\\right\\rangle ,   \\label{eq : mpsrep}\\]]where @xmath42}=p^{[m]}q$ ] is a @xmath38 matrix .",
    "in periodic boundary conditions , the vbs states are invariant under lattice translation and transformation of the lie group @xmath0 by construction .",
    "although no local order parameters can be found to characterize these states , the @xmath42}$ ] matrices can fully determine their physical properties and render a local  description .",
    "in open boundary conditions , edge states emerge at the two ends of the chain and then the matrix - product form of the vbs states is given by@xmath43}a^{[m_{2}]}\\cdots a^{[m_{n}]})_{\\alpha , \\beta } \\left\\vert m_{1}\\cdots m_{n}\\right\\rangle ,   \\label{eq : obc - mps}\\]]where the matrix indices @xmath44 denote the edge states .",
    "these edge degrees of freedom are described by two fractionalized particles transforming under @xmath27 representation of the lie group @xmath0 .",
    "actually , the edge states and their representations are characteristic features of the vbs states , because they fully determine the local @xmath42}$ ] matrices .    another useful way to represent the vbs states is to use boson or fermion realization methods . to illustrate this method , we trace back to the tensor product decomposition of irs of lie algebras . according to the group theory , the physical states @xmath45 under the exchange of the two identical virtual particles is either symmetric or antisymmetric , depending on @xmath29 and @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the two virtual particles with fermion statistics create the antisymmetric states , while the bosonic particles yield the symmetric ones . in some cases , there are still several channels with the same exchange symmetry and additional projection has to be used to single out the physical states in @xmath29 .",
    "for example , the fermionic realization of a spin-@xmath46 vbs state with virtual spin @xmath18 was considered in ref . @xcite . in this case , both site - quintet states ( @xmath47 ) and site - singlet state ( @xmath48 ) are allowed for two spin-@xmath49 fermions on a single site and an extra projection can remove the unphysical site - singlet state .",
    "there also exists the schwinger boson realization which symmetrizes several fundamental irs to form higher dimensional @xmath29 s .",
    "@xcite  in fact , all these boson / fermion realization methods play the role of ( sometimes partially ) deleting the unphysical states .      following the spirit of the aklt model",
    ", one can construct the parent hamiltonians such that the vbs states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vbsstate ] )  are their unique ground states .",
    "it is most convenient to work with the matrix - product form . for the matrix product states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mpsrep ] ) , one can readily find that their reduced density matrix @xmath50 of @xmath51 successive sites has a rank of @xmath52 at most .",
    "this suggests that the reduced density matrix @xmath50 of these vbs  states always have null space for sufficient large @xmath51 .",
    "these states are annihilated by the local projection operators supported in the null space .",
    "hence , they are always exact zero - energy ground states of the translationally invariant hamiltonians@xmath53where @xmath54 contains a sum of the positive semi - definite projection operators supported in the null space from site @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "previously , the parent hamiltonians of the matrix product states for spin - ladder systems had been studied by similar methods.@xcite        let us begin with the simplest cases with only nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "now the null space can be obtained from the vbs picture of these states .",
    "the hilbert space of two neighboring sites can be divided into a direct sum of different ir channels according to the tensor product decomposition @xmath57 .",
    "once a valence - bond singlet of two virtual @xmath27 s is formed , the remaining two particles of adjacent sites can transform under a direct sum of irs resulting from @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the ir  channels contained in @xmath57 but absent in @xmath59 constitute the null space in the @xmath46-site reduced density matrix .",
    "the above steps to locate the null space can be embedded in a matrix - product formalism . practically , we rewrite the matrix - product states in eq .",

    "after this coarse - graining  procedure , the vbs states are transformed to a matrix - product form with @xmath46-site block spins , characterized by the block - independent matrices @xmath71}$ ] .",
    "since the @xmath46-site block spin states @xmath67 form a complete orthogonal set , the null space in the reduced density matrix of a @xmath46-site block is given by those ir channels with @xmath64}=0 $ ] .",
    "the null space for more than two adjacent sites is no longer easilyvisualized .",

    "the uniqueness of the vbs ground states of the constructed hamiltonians has to be further clarified .",
