    "turbulence is a fascinating open problem cutting across scientific boundaries . in magnetic fusion research",
    ", understanding turbulence is a key element for the theoretical explanation of the heat and particle transport in tokamak devices both in the core and edge regions , including the much - debated formation of the plasma pedestal in the high - confinement regime . in particular",
    ", understanding the turbulent behavior of the plasma in the most external region of a tokamak , the scrape - off - layer ( sol ) , has important implication for the operation of present and future devices , such as iter @xcite .",
    "the plasma profiles in the sol region form from the balance between the plasma outflowing from the tokamak core , turbulence transport and end losses at the physical boundary ( limiter or divertor ) of the device .",
    "this turbulent dynamics in the sol is characterized by large fluctuations with amplitudes comparable to the background plasma , and can manifest itself in radially - propagating , coherent meso - scale modes called blobs , which have been suggested to carry ( together with streamers ) a significant fraction of the heat transport through rare avalanche - like events .",
    "@xcite blobs are typically intermittent events with a patchy spatial and bursty temporal structure and are responsible for deviations of the probability distribution function ( pdf )  in the form of exponential tails  from the gaussian prediction based on the traditional mean - field theory .",
    "@xcite controlling the edge heat flux loads , which depend on the instant amplitude of fluctuations , as opposed to the mean load , calls for a thorough understanding of intermittency , both in terms of analytical modelling and numerical investigations .    a pivotal idea to study intermittency",
    "has been to associate the bursty event with the creation of a coherent structure .",
    "a candidate that could describe the creation process of the structure is the instanton , which is localized in time and lives during the formation of the coherent structure .",
    "the instanton method is a non - perturbative way of calculating pdf tails , which was adopted from quantum field theory and then modified to classical statistical physics for burgers turbulence and a passive scalar model .",
    "@xcite for instance , using the instanton method , it has been shown in reference that the pdf tails of momentum flux @xmath0 are significantly enhanced over the gaussian prediction .",
    "more specifically , the tail exhibits a ubiquitous scaling of the form @xmath1 , where the coefficient @xmath2 contains all the model - dependent information .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we investigate the statistics governing sol turbulence by employing first - principles numerical simulations and theoretical analysis alike .",
    "starting point for both approaches is a drift - reduced set of the braginskii fluid equations , @xcite which describes interchange driven turbulence .",
    "our scope is to confirm theoretical predictions about the behavior of the pdf for the density through numerical results stemming from the simulations . by modeling the plasma outflowing from the core as a time - independent source",
    ", we further exclude from our model the coupling of sol turbulence with the plasma dynamics inside the lcfs .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that far - sol simulations of typical l - mode turbulence in the inner - wall - limited alcator c - mod configuration manifest similar statistical properties when compared with experimental observations using gas - puff imaging @xcite .",
    "this points to the possibility that turbulent structures traveling through the sol are generated near the lcfs .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec1 ] we present the drift - reduced braginskii equations , followed by the analytical modeling in section [ sec2 ] , where a generalized system of stochastic partial differential equations is presented , as an extension of the braginskii system . in the same section",
    ", we derive the properties of the pdf for the density .",
    "section [ sec3 ] deals with the numerical simulations and the mathematical processing of the output data , in order to reconcile these with the theoretical results .",
    "finally , we provide a short summary of the work in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "for the present study , we use a cold - ion drift - reduced model , which can be derived from the braginskii two - fluid equations@xcite by imposing the orderings @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "particle trapping is negligible since @xmath6 in the sol of limited plasmas , while finite larmor radius effects are small since @xmath7 for the dominant modes in the non - linear stage .",
    "since the plasma is relatively cold , a fluid model can capture the essential physical ingredients of this system .",

    "the simulations are initialized using flat smooth profiles .",
    "then , particle and heat sources are injected , driving resistive ballooning modes linearly unstable , which in turn induces turbulent transport . as an outcome",
    ", a quasi - steady - state regime is established as a balance between the plasma sources , turbulent transport , and sheath losses .",
    "the pressure gradient length @xmath84 is not predetermined , as in linear calculations , but is instead obtained self - consistently from the calculation . in the case under study ,",
    "the turbulent dynamics is dominated by resistive ballooning modes , with the non - linear saturation given by the pressure non - linearity  @xcite .",
    "a typical poloidal cross section of the sol is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_gbs1 ] .",
    "as it will be shown , the physics involved defines two distinct regions regarding the turbulence fluctuations in the simulation domain : at the left boundary the injected plasma is driving flute - like , radially elongated turbulent eddies , which define the near sol . in this region , fluctuations have an essentially gaussian pdf , and intermittent events are rare .",
    "however , as the turbulent structures propagate into the far sol , they are sheared apart and detached blobs appear , forming the so - called blobby region. here , intermittent events become much more frequent and important as the vessel wall is approached . in order to corroborate these statements",
    ", we have to explore the statistical properties of simulations in both the source and blobby regions , and try to differentiate between the two .",
    "this will be achieved by means of singular spectrum analysis ( ssa ) @xcite , a well - known mathematical method for analysing the structural behavior of relatively small time - traces , by filtering out possibly existing ( deterministic ) oscillatory components from a weakly stochastic process ( a typical picture is the superposition of noise on a sinusoidal signal ) .",
    "such oscillatory components pertain to normal modes in the sol simulations , which have to be removed before we embark on the statistical analysis of the gbs output data in each region of the domain .",
    "it is noteworthy , that ssa has been successfully adopted by several scientific fields , like geology @xcite , economics @xcite and medicine @xcite , but hardly so in plasma physics ( however , see @xcite for a notable exception ) .",
    "we shall begin our numerical study with a simulation in the source region . in fig .",
    "2 we show the time - trace of the density at radial location @xmath85 . we apply ssa on this signal in order to track down any oscillatory components present , which will manifest themselves as the largest eigenvalues in the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "2 . it turns out that the first eigenvalue is the most dominant one , and therefore the one to be removed from the time - trace . having done this , the remaining component of the time - trace is also shown in fig .",
    "2 . we will now show that the filtered data actually follows a gaussian distribution appropriate for the weak nonlinear regime of the simplified model . for this",
    ", we employ the quantile - quantile ( qq ) plot of the data against the normal quantiles ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . for further ease of inspection , we superpose the gaussian data with the same mean and standard deviation as the filtered data .",
    "it is clearly seen that these two sets of data almost coincide , which speaks for the gaussian nature of the gbs filtered data .",
    "the situation radically changes , however , in the blobby region . in fig .",
    "3 , we present the gbs data from sol simulations in the blobby region , both raw and filtered , in the same fashion as before . again , the dominant eigenvalue is the first one , which has been removed to obtain the filtered data ( see fig .",
    "the distinct spikes in the filtered data are responsible for the emergence of a strong tail , as shown in the qq plot ( fig .",
    "5 ) . in this case , the gaussian data with the same mean and standard deviation is clearly unable to capture the simulation data .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to reproduce the tail by employing an exponential deviation to the straight line joining the 1st and 3rd quantiles of the filtered data ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , where this assumption is justified by the form of the pdf in eq .",
    "[ eq:1.18 ] .",
    "the analysis of the numerically generated data shows a distinct deviation from gaussianity in the blob region , as seen in fig . 5 , which is a salient feature in the whole blob region whereas in the source region the filtered statistics exhibit gaussian pdfs .",
    "this corroborates the first principles analytical modeling , suggesting that the tails of the pdfs are manifestly exponential as a result of the non - linear dynamics present in the sol region .",
    "transport in the tokamak scrape - off layer is dominated by intermittent and bursty processes , rendering mean - field - theory models inadequate for its description . in this work ,",
    "we have employed the braginskii fluid solver gbs to investigate the intermittent characteristics of the transport driven by coherent structures , such as blobs . at the same time",
    ", we derived from first principles a stochastic likelihood model of the plasma density , which is able to predict the tails of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "the derivation of the model is based on the fokker - planck approach , yielding a closed analytical expression suitable for comparison to both numerical and experimental data . to enable such comparisons ,",
    "we have processed the numerical data using the singular spectrum analysis , which filters out possibly existing oscillatory ( deterministic ) components from a weakly - stochastic time - trace .",
    "we have shown that the statistics of time - traces of the density can be modeled with the pdf derived from the stochastic model . as further work",
    ", we envisage the study of higher moments , such as transport coefficients , by extending the theoretical model as well as the ssa methodology in order to handle cross - correlated time - traces .",

    "<S> the turbulence observed in the scrape - off - layer of a tokamak is often characterized by intermittent events of bursty nature , a feature which raises concerns about the prediction of heat loads on the physical boundaries of the device . </S>",
    "<S> it appears thus necessary to delve into the statistical properties of turbulent physical fields such as density , electrostatic potential and temperature , focusing on the mathematical expression of tails of the probability distribution functions . </S>",
    "<S> the method followed here is to generate statistical information from time - traces of the plasma density stemming from braginskii - type fluid simulations , and check this against a first - principles theoretical model . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the numerical simulations indicates that the probability distribution function of the intermittent process contains strong exponential tails , as predicted by the analytical theory . </S>"
