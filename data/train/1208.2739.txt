    "limitations of the efficiency of the existing solar cells motivate continuous search for new technological solutions that might lead to more efficient photovoltaic conversion .",
    "one of the fundamental limitations on the efficiency of the existing solar cells results from the fact that photons with energies higher than the energy gap of the semiconductor excite high energetic electrons in its conduction band .",
    "the excess energy of these charge carriers is dissipated in a phonon relaxation processes and is therefore lost for photovoltaic conversion .",
    ".,width=226 ]    among systems that are investigated for possible use in solar energy conversion devices in order to overcome these losses are semiconductor nanocrystals ( ncs ) .",
    "the increased efficiency of photovoltaic conversion in nc - based devices might result from multiple exciton generation ( meg ) due to impact ionization ( inverse auger ) processes@xcite .",
    "such an effect consists in generation of two or more electron - hole pairs by a single high energy photon and thus converts the excess above - bandgap energy into useful current .",
    "this process is enabled by coulomb coupling between single - pair ( exciton , x ) states and two - pair ( biexciton , bx ) states in a nc ( or , in general , between states with @xmath1 and @xmath2 pairs ) , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : impactionization ] .",
    "it can result from the system dynamics after optical creation of a single electron - hole pair , during which an electron relaxes within the conduction band transferring its energy to an intraband excitation ( an inverse auger process , in which the two situations in fig .",
    "[ fig : impactionization ] are understood as `` initial '' and `` final '' ) .",
    "however , very short time scales of the biexciton generation @xcite suggest that the process may be instantaneous and result from the mixing between the x and bx states . in this case , the original x states contain on the average more than one electron - hole pair , while the initially dark bx states become optically active .",
    "the meg process can be thus understood as an excitation of a bx state mediated by a `` virtual '' x state to which it is coupled @xcite ( the two states in fig .  [",
    "fig : impactionization ] are then interpreted as the `` virtual '' state that is directly coupled to light and the final bx state that is optically excited via the coulomb - induced mixing ) .",
    "clearly , in this picture , the degree of mixing between the states and their spectral distributions ( spectral densities ) are crucial for the efficiency of the meg process .",
    "another possible process @xcite involves coulomb coupling between empty nc and bx states and relies on an intermediate bx state .",
    "the meg effect has been observed using a variety of experimental techniques in ncs formed of various narrow - gap semiconductors and under various excitation conditions @xcite , as well as in systems of coupled ncs @xcite . in some experiments , quantum efficiencies as high as 700%",
    "were observed @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some later experimental investigation showed much lower efficiencies of the meg process or even no traces of meg at all @xcite .",
    "the subsequent discussion of the experimental factors involved in extracting the meg efficiency from experimental data @xcite showed that performing reliable experiments and correctly interpreting their results is not quite trivial .",
    "uncontrolled effects present in the experiments , like photocharging of the nc core and charge trapping at the surface ligands , can indeed lead to a considerably overestimated result @xcite . in any case , however , enhanced photocurrent due to meg has been observed in real nc - based solar cells@xcite providing a direct proof of the usefulness of this process in solar energy conversion .",
    "still , the experimental results and the controversies they arouse motivate theoretical work aimed at full understanding of the meg process in ncs .",
    "theoretical description of the x and bx spectrum and the x - bx couplings is sought within various approaches available for modeling semiconductor nanostructures .",
    "atomistic approaches to this problem include density functional theory @xcite , pseudopotential @xcite and tight binding @xcite methods .",
    "however , the high computational complexity of atomistic methods limits the size of tractable systems and forces one to radically truncate the basis of single particle functions when computing the properties of few - particle complexes .",
    "therefore , one often resorts to an envelope function approach based on the k@xmath3p theory @xcite , which was very useful in the past for understanding the fundamental electronic properties of ncs @xcite .",
    "apart from establishing the spectral distribution of the x and bx levels , the central point of any theoretical modeling of the meg process is the evaluation of the x - bx coulomb matrix element which can then be used , e.g , to find the spectral properties of correlated x - bx states @xcite or to study the system kinetics @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we present the calculations of the coulomb matrix elements between x and bx states within an envelope function approach .",
    "this approach is much more explicit than the atomistic computations and yields relatively transparent formulas for the matrix elements that offer much more insight into the properties of the x - bx couplings .",
    "this allows us to point out that the correct treatment of the bloch parts of the carrier wave functions ( which was not made explicit in previous works ) leads to selection rules for the newly created pair identical to those holding for optical transitions .",
    "in addition , the interband character of the coupling reduces the matrix element ( as compared to the usual electron - electron interaction ) by a factor @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is on the order of the lattice constant and @xmath6 is the radius of the nc , and leads to the @xmath0 dependence on the nc size . on the practical side",
    ", the envelope function approach leads to formulas that , for a spherical nc , can be evaluated at very modest computational cost .",
    "this allows us to find coupled pairs of x - bx states in a very broad energy window and to study the distribution of the magnitudes of the matrix elements vs. the energies of the coupled configurations . here",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the simplest example of an application of the proposed formalism and calculate the matrix elements using a very simple model of wave functions in order to extract very general statistics on the x - bx couplings .",
    "the important conclusion from this study is that the x - bx state mixing is on the average dominated by relatively strongly coupled pairs of energetically close states .",
    "this means , on one hand , that admixture of the bx states to the x states ( or conversely ) can not be treated perturbatively . on the other hand",
    ", it shows that truncating the set of states to an energy window around a given x ( or bx ) state is a well - defined and convergent approximation .",
    "quantitatively , the matrix elements found for an inas nc are in the mev range , which is clearly very small compared to typical separations of single particle states in these structures .",
    "still , admixture of bx states to a given x state can reach several to a few tens per cent due to relatively large density of coupled bx states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] , we derive general formulas for the coulomb matrix element between x and bx configurations in a spherical nc .",
    "next , in sec .",

    "in this section we present a general derivation of the matrix element underlying the meg process in a nc .",
    "the calculation will be performed in the envelope function approximation . to simplify the notation we assume identical envelopes for all bands but generalization to arbitrary envelope wave functions is straightforward .",
    "we calculate the matrix elements between single - subband wave functions .",
    "the result can be generalized to derive the coulomb couplings between states in more accurate models including band mixing .",
    "we consider a spherical nc of radius @xmath6 with the dielectric constant @xmath7 , emerged in a host material with the dielectric constant @xmath8 .",
    "the electron - trion coupling responsible for the impact ionization process results from the coulomb coupling between the states in conduction and valence bands , corresponding to an intraband transition of an electron accompanied by the creation of an additional electron - hole pair ( inverse auger process ) as shown schematically in fig.[fig : impactionization ] .",
    "the relevant part of the coulomb hamiltonian is @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the annihilation and creation operators for an electron in the conduction subband @xmath11 and in the envelope state @xmath12 , while @xmath13 are the annihilation and creation operators for an electron in the valence subband @xmath14 and in the envelope state @xmath15 .",
    "the index @xmath12 represents the whole set of relevant quantum numbers . the graphical interpretation of this term is given in fig .",

    "we write the wave functions in the single - band envelope approximation in the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the envelope and @xmath18 is the lattice - periodic bloch part ( @xmath19 denotes the value of the electron spin ) .",
    "the position vector is written as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the center of the @xmath22th unit cell ( u.c . ) and @xmath23 lies in the first u.c .",
    "the integration over the whole nc volume is then expressed as a summation over all the unit cells and integration over one cell .",
    "we assume that the envelope functions change slowly , so that @xmath24 and use the periodicity of the bloch functions @xmath25 .",
    "the matrix element is then given by @xmath26    the two - particle interaction energy in a spherical nc is composed of the direct coulomb interaction and the coupling via surface polarization due to dielectric discontinuity between the nc and the environment @xcite , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 here @xmath29 , @xmath30 are legendre polynomials , @xmath31 with @xmath32 , and we take into account only the two - particle part of the surface polarization term .    in consequence , the coulomb matrix element splits into the corresponding two contributions @xmath33",
    "for the direct coulomb term , which is singular at @xmath34 , we split the summation into @xmath35 ( short - range contribution ) and @xmath36 ( long range contribution ) . for the former",

    "the four - particle states are labeled by the electron spin configuration ( @xmath91 ) for singlet and the three triplet states , respectively and by the hole spin configuration . if only the topmost valence band ( @xmath92 ) is included than the two - hole configurations can be classified in the following way , which is convenient for our purpose : the states with both holes in @xmath81 or both holes in @xmath86 states are combined in singlet - like and triplet - like configurations @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",

    "as one can see , in spite of the enormous number of bx states in the energy range taken into account the number of states with @xmath171 can only reach several tens for a single x state ( note that the numbers in the figure give the total number of bx states coupled to all the @xmath179 x states ) .",
    "moreover , only for a small fraction of these states one finds @xmath180 ( which corresponds to an admixture of bx state above 1% ) . for the specific nc size unser",
    "study only in one case a close resonance between an x state and a coupled bx state was found that resulted in the @xmath176 ratio exceeding 1 .    .",

    "[ fig : h - de ] ) with the much larger numbers found in the broad energy range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zbiorcze ] ) one might conclude that remote states play an important role in the x - bx state mixing and , in consequence , in the meg efficiency . from the point of view of theoretical modeling , this opens the critical question whether the actual situation can be reasonably approximated by a model that takes into account only bx states in a certain , sufficiently large spectral window around a given x state or , in other words , whether the approximate results converge sufficiently fast when extending the spectral window . in order to approach the answer to this question",
    "we have estimated the statistical distribution of the values of @xmath185 based on our simplified nc model .",
    "the result for a single nc with @xmath156  nm is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram-1](a ) . in order to obtain a single characteristics we present a joint distribution of the @xmath176 ratios for all the x states below 5  ev , divided again in the three groups of spin configurations . as could be expected ,",
    "the number of weakly coupled bx states is the highest , while the number of states coupled by larger matrix elements decreases quickly with the growing strength of the coupling ( note that the number of bx states in the lowest sector of @xmath186 , not shown in the figure , is formally infinite ) .",
    "the same tendency is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram-1](b ) where an analogous distribution is shown in the same way for an ensemble of nc in which we have assumed a gaussian distribution of the radii with the mean @xmath182  nm and the fwhm equal to @xmath183  nm . in both cases , a dependence of the form @xmath181 is found , which is rigorously confirmed by the logarithmic plot in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram-1](b ) , where this power law dependence is seen to be maintained over a surprisingly broad range of the @xmath186 values .",
    "the fact that the exponent of this power law distribution is equal to 2 is remarkable : according to the perturbation theory ( which is valid for small values of @xmath186 ) , the admixture of a single bx state to a given x state is equal to @xmath187 . hence , if there are @xmath188 states with a certain value of @xmath186 then their joint contribution is equal to @xmath189 .",
    "the scaling @xmath190 means that the growing number of weakly coupling states exactly compensates the decreasing magnitude of the matrix element so that , on the average , bx states with all the coupling strengths contribute equally .",
    "this has the immediate consequence that discarding the part of the coupled states with @xmath191 generates a computational error that decreases proportionally to @xmath192 .",
    "this means that , in principle , a numerical computation can be performed with arbitrary accuracy based on a properly selected set of bx states . in fact , since the values of the matrix elements seem to be bounded , this implies convergence in terms of the width of the energy window assumed .",
    "this property , that holds only for a power law exponent below 3 , is very desirable and usually implicitly taken for granted in numerical computations @xcite but it seems by no means obvious .     for an ensemble of ncs with the mean radius @xmath182  nm and the fwhm of the radius distribution of @xmath183  nm.,width=321 ]    a direct confirmation of this `` homogeneous contribution '' property resulting from the @xmath181 scaling",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram-2 ] . here",
    "each histogram bar is multiplied by @xmath187 . as a result",
    ", a remarkably constant distribution is obtained , which is particularly visible in the inset , where the cumulative distribution is shown , which has a linear form across a very wide range of values . while this flat distribution is an interesting feature ,",
    "it should be noted that the value of @xmath193 has no direct physical meaning at high @xmath186 where the perturbation theory is not applicable .",
    "in fact , this part of the distribution is due to very few bx states that come to resonance with some of the x states for a certain value of @xmath6 . at resonance ,",
    "the value of @xmath186 is infinite but the maximum admixture in the case of just two resonant states is 1/2 .        finally , let us estimate the degree of mixing between the x and bx states . in fig .  [",
    "fig : mix ] , we show the bx admixture to the selected x states considered here as a function of the nc radius .",
    "this is obtained separately for each x state by diagonalizing the hamiltonian including only the x state in question and all the bx sates directly coupled to this x state by matrix elements for which @xmath194 .",
    "for each @xmath6 , the eigenstate @xmath195 with the highest @xmath196 contribution is found and the bx admixture is determined as @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the x state and @xmath199 are all the coupled bx states .",
    "we show the results for one selected state out of each subspace with fixed @xmath1 and @xmath157 , except for the states @xmath200 which are presented in full to see that the admixture to states that differ only by the value of @xmath201 is very similar ( which is due to the fact that these states are almost degenerate ) .",
    "as expected , the low energy states @xmath202 and @xmath203 , lying below the theoretical meg threshold of 2.6  ev , have the bx admixtures well below 1%",
    ". however , the same is true for states lying up to 1  ev above the threshold .",
    "this property results from the selection rules that hold in the meg process , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] : an x state needs to be located in the vicinity of a bx state to which it is coupled , which becomes likely only when the density of bx states becomes sufficiently high . on the other hand ,",
    "the states with energies above 4  ev are typically much more strongly mixed with bx states . even in these case , in spite of hundreds of bx states coupled to each such x state , the admixture only in some cases approaches 80% for a certain nc radius and for most ( but not all ) states drops down as @xmath6 increases .",
    "note that the admixture strongly depends on the nc size and in the case of the state @xmath204 shows strong oscillations .",
    "in general , while the x states are clearly not completely dissolved in the densely distributed bx states , the degree of mixing between x and bx states becomes considerable at energies a few ev above the meg threshold which may lead to the meg efficiency of a few tens per cent .",
    "the main result presented in this paper is the method for calculating coulomb matrix elements between exciton and biexciton states in semiconductor nanocrystals based on the envelope function formalism .",
    "we have shown that such a calculation requires proper treatment of the bloch parts of the carrier wave functions which , in the leading order , leads to spin selection rules identical to those holding for optical interband transitions ( however , the rules for envelope states are different ) . moreover ,",
    "the resulting matrix elements are additionally scaled by the ratio of the lattice constant to the nc radius , as compared to the usual ( intraband ) coulomb couplings . as a result ,",
    "the coulomb coupling between x and bx states scale as @xmath0 .",
    "once the matrix elements between single - band states are known they can be used for calculating x - bx couplings using more exact carrier states found by diagonalizing the 8-band kane ( ) hamiltonian .",
    "this approach has been found to correctly reproduce the nc spectrum down to very small sizes @xcite and , when combined with the results presented here , can provide quantitatively accurate description of the meg process in ncs . for more accuracy , coulomb correlations , in particular in bx states @xcite ,",
    "could also be included .",
    "while atomistic models may offer more accurate single particle wave functions and allow one to include more system features ( e.g. , surface defects @xcite ) , their high computational costs limits the extent to which few - particle states and couplings between them can be treated .",
    "typically , when following an atomistic approach , one is forced to restrict the calculations to an energy window around a given x or bx state and to truncate the basis of bx states when simulating the system dynamics @xcite . from this point of view , the method based on the envelope function formalism may offer a complementary approach to the trade - off between the accuracy of single - particle states and the reliability of few - particle modeling in which the accuracy of the atomistic models is sacrificed in favor of lowering the computational effort , which offers considerably more flexibility on the subsequent stages of theoretical analysis , including the system dynamics @xcite and dissipative evolution @xcite , where finding the x - bx coupling is the essential prerequisite for further modeling .",
    "an additional benefit is the transparent nature of our envelope function method , which offers mostly analytical treatment and does not rely on large computational resources or dedicated software , hence can easily be employed by a broad community of researchers .",
    "while performing full multi - band calculations is beyond the scope of this work , we have presented some preliminary estimates of the statistical distribution of the coupling magnitudes and the energies of the coupled states using a very simple single - band envelope function approach .",
    "such overall statistical conclusions are likely to be valid even if the underlying characteristics of individual states are not absolutely accurate .",
    "we have shown that the number of bx states coupled to x states form a certain energy range scales as inverse square of the ratio of the coupling magnitude to the energy separation .",
    "this scaling property is remarkable as it guarantees that the contribution of remote states is finite and controllable , which justifies limiting the computation to an energy window ( no matter what computational method is chosen ) @xcite .",
    "finally , we have estimated the degree of mixing between x and bx states as a function of the nc size .",
    "very small bx admixture to x states has been found below and within 1  ev above the meg threshold .",
    "much larger mixing , reaching 80% , appears for higher - energy states .",
    "the amount of bx admixture to this states varies quite strongly when the nc radius is changed by a fraction of a nanometer .",
    "this may suggest that modeling based on a single nc size may not be representative for average properties of an ensemble .",
