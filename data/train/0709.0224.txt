    "exclusive production of mesons was studied in details only at fixed target collisons at cern . at present , there is ongoing investigations at tevatron aiming to measure the exclusive production of both vector and scalar quarkonia , but no result is yet publicly available . only an upper limit for @xmath4",
    "was given up to now @xcite .",
    "there is a long standing debate about the nature of the pomeron .",
    "the approximate @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the azimuthal angle between outgoing protons ) dependence observed experimentally for @xmath7 @xcite was interpreted in ref.@xcite as due to ( vector pomeron)-(vector pomeron)-(pseudoscalar meson ) coupling . the qcd - inspired calculation for diffractive production of pseudoscalar mesons",
    "was presented only recently in ref.@xcite . here",
    "i shall present some results from that analysis obtained within the pqcd approach of khoze - martin - ryskin ( kmr ) @xcite .",
    "recently the @xmath3 exclusive production in proton - proton and proton - antiproton collisions was suggested as a candidate in searches for odderon exchange @xcite . in order to identify the odderon exchange one",
    "has to consider all other possible processes leading to the same final channel .",
    "one of such processes , probably dominant , is pomeron - photon or photon - pomeron fusion @xcite .",
    "the diffractive photoproduction of @xmath3mesons has been recently a subject of thorough studies at hera @xcite , and serves to elucidate the physics of the qcd pomeron and/or the small@xmath8 gluon density in the proton ( for a recent review and references , see @xcite ) .",
    "being charged particles , protons / antiprotons available at rhic , tevatron and lhc are a source of high energy weizscker  williams photons .",
    "those photons interact with the other nucleon . in some cases such an interaction leads to elastical ( ground state proton ) production of @xmath3 . in the approach presented here the amplitude for the @xmath9 reaction is related to the amplitude of the photoproduction @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "such a method of calculating cross section is expected to be much more precise than any qcd approach which does not refer to the @xmath11 hera data .",

    "as an example in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsig_dxf ] i show the results of calculations obtained with several models of ugdf ( for details see @xcite ) for relatively low energy w = 29.1 gev . for comparison",
    "i show also the contribution of the @xmath15 fusion mechanism .",
    "the contribution of the last mechanism is much smaller than the contribution of the diffractive qcd mechanism .     as a function of feynman @xmath16 for w = 29.1 gev and for different ugdfs .",

    "however , at @xmath20 0.2 gev@xmath19 the qed mechanism may become equally important or even dominant .",

    "quite different results are obtained for different ugdfs .",
    "the cross section with the kharzeev - levin type distribution ( based on the idea of gluon saturation ) gives the cross section which is relatively small and almost idependent of beam energy .",
    "in contrast , the bfkl distribution leads to strong energy dependence .",
    "the sensitivity to the transverse momenta of initial gluons can be seen by comparison of the two solid lines calculated with the gaussian ugdf with different smearing parameter @xmath21 = 0.2 and 0.5 gev .",

    "the amplitude for the corresponding @xmath23 process can be written as @xmath24 after some algebra it can be written in the compact form : @xmath25 the differential cross section is given in terms of @xmath26 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the rapidity of the vector meson , and @xmath29 is the angle between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "notice that the interference between the two mechanisms @xmath32 and @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath34 and introduces a charge asymmetry as well as an angular correlation between the outgoing protons .    in fig.[fig",
    ": dsig_dy_energy ] i collect rapidity distributions for different energies relevant at rhic , tevatron and lhc .",
    "one observes an occurence of a small dip in the distribution at midrapidities at lhc energy .",
    "one should remember , however , that the distribution for the lhc energy is long - distance extrapolation of the @xmath35 amplitude ( or cross section ) to unexplored yet experimentally energies @xmath36 .",
    "therefore a real experiment at tevatron and lhc would help to constrain cross sections for @xmath37 process .",

    "surprisingly , the interference effect between both diagrams is significant over broad range of @xmath3 rapidity .",
    "one can see that even at large @xmath3 rapidities one observes ansisotropic distributions in the azimuthal angle .",
    "this means that interference between photon - pomeron and pomeron - photon mechanisms survives up to large rapidities .",

    "reaction the situation is more complicated as here @xmath45 ( or @xmath40 ) strong rescatterings occur in addition . in ref.@xcite we have included only elastic rescatterings shown schematically in fig.[fig : diagram_rescattering ] .",

    "generally , the bigger @xmath46 and/or @xmath47 the bigger the absorption . on average , the absorption for the @xmath40 reaction is smaller than the absorption for the @xmath41 reactions .",
    "in contrast to diffractive higgs production , in the case of ligh meson production the main contribution to the diffractive amplitude comes from the region of very small gluon transverse momenta and very small longitudinal momentum fractions . in this case application of khoze - martin - ryskin ugdfs seems not justified and we have to rely on ugdfs constructed for this region .",
    "the existing models of ugdfs predict cross section much smaller than the one obtained by the wa102 collaboration at the center - of - mass energy w = 29.1 gev .",
    "this may signal presence of subleading reggeons at the energy of the wa102 experiment or suggest a modificaction of ugdfs in the nonperturbative region of very small transverse momenta .    due to a nonlocality of the loop integral",
    "our model leads to sizeable deviations from the @xmath48 dependence ( predicted in the models of one - step fusion of two vector objects ) .",
    "the @xmath15 fusion may be of some importance only at extremely small four - momentum transfers squared .",

    "this would be correspondingly 200 gev @xmath49 8000 gev . at very forward",
    "/ backward rapidities this is an order of magnitude more than possible with presently available machines .",
    "we have estimated also absorption effects . in some selected configurations",
    "the absorption effects may lead to the occurence of diffractive minima .",
    "the exact occurence of diffractive minima depends on the values of the model parameters .",
    "such minima are washed out when integrated over the phase space or even its part .",
    "we have found that on average the rescattering effects in proton - antiproton reactions are much bigger than in proton - proton reactions . in this case",
