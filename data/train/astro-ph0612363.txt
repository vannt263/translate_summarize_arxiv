    "the first sources of light that ended the cosmic dark ages are expected to have reionized the intergalactic medium and polluted it with metals ( see a review by , e.g. , @xcite ) . to use the metal enrichment as a potential probe of the reionization epoch , recent studies have concentrated on the neutral oxygen ( oi ) produced by the first massive stars @xcite .",
    "the ionization potential of oi is only 0.2 ev higher than that of hydrogen ( hi ) , and the two species are in charge exchange equilibrium .",
    "therefore , oxygen is likely to be highly ionized in regions of the igm where hydrogen is ionized .",
    "however , the recombination time for oxygen ( as for hydrogen ) is shorter than the hubble time at @xmath13 , indicating that oxygen can be neutral even in regions where h has been ionized but where short  lived ionizing sources have turned off , allowing the region to recombine @xcite . indeed , @xcite show that such fossil hii regions can occupy @xmath14 of the volume of the igm prior to reionization . while the metal pollution of these regions is poorly understood , it is feasible that they contain significant amount of oxygen with a neutral fraction close to unity .",
    "previous work has proposed to exploit the scattering of uv photons by oi , and the corresponding absorption features in the spectra of quasars  the oi forest @xcite , analogous to the lower  redshift hi lyman @xmath15 forest ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of hi ,",
    "another interesting signature from the high  redshift igm is the 21 cm hyperfine structure line , which is made detectable by uv pumping by the lyman @xmath15 background ( the so  called wouthuysen - field effect ; see @xcite or @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "here we examine whether a similar effect occurs for oi .    here",
    "we demonstrate that there exist oi lines with the required features : the fine structure lines of the electronic ground state , @xmath16 and @xmath17 m , can be pumped by @xmath9  photons produced by the first stars or black holes , via the balmer @xmath15 line of oi .",
    "we compute the spectral distortion in the cmb created by this effect , and find that it can be as high as @xmath18 if the oi metallicity at @xmath19 , just prior to reionization , is @xmath20 .",
    "this distortion could be detectable with future cmb experiments , and opens the possibility of performing tomography of the reionization epoch using this effect . in combination with 21 cm studies , it could yield direct measurements of the abundance and spatial distribution of metals in the high  redshift igm .",
    "the basic criteria for a line @xmath21 of a metal species or their ions to produce an effect analogous to the wouthuysen ",
    "field pumping of the hi 21 cm line , are as follows : ( i ) abundant metals in the igm in the required ionization state ; ( ii ) the @xmath22 transition at a frequency suitable for detection , with einstein coefficients small enough to allow the line to deviate from equilibrium with the cmb ; ( iii ) the upper and lower states should be connected via allowed transitions to another state ( hereafter called state 2 ) , so that they can be `` pumped '' in a two  step process ; ( iv ) a large enough background flux at the wavelength @xmath23 corresponding to the @xmath24 and @xmath25 transitions .",
    "in particular , the last criterion imposes the constraint @xmath26 on the wavelength of the uv pumping photons before reionization , since neutral hi depletes the background at shorter wavelengths @xcite .    we selected oxygen for our study because it can be relatively abundant at high redshifts and because the similarity of its ionization potential to that of hydrogen ( we leave a systematic search through other metal lines to future work ) .",
    "the ground state of neutral oxygen is split into the three fine structure levels of the outermost electrons in the @xmath27 shell , hereafter denoted as @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "we found that among the electronic states of oxygen , these are the only one satisfying all of the criteria above and which photons would be observed in the cmb frequency band .",
    "the states @xmath28@xmath29 and @xmath29@xmath30 are connected by magnetic dipolar transitions [ oi ] @xmath31 at 63.2 @xmath32 m and @xmath33 at 145.5 @xmath32 m respectively and the states @xmath28@xmath30 are connected by an electric quadrupolar transition @xmath34 at 44.1 @xmath32 m .",
    "we shall consider only lines involving the @xmath28 state @xmath35 as the lower level for the transition , since the cmb ambient field is practically unable to populate the @xmath36 state , and the 145.5 @xmath32 m line will be suppressed .",
    "since these transitions are forbidden , the spontaneous emission einstein coefficients ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 s@xmath39 , @xmath40 ) are much smaller than the typical values for electric dipole transitions ( @xmath41 ) , a property shared by the hydrogen 21 cm line with @xmath42 s@xmath39 .",
    "the states @xmath28 and @xmath43 are connected to the excited electronic state @xmath44 in the @xmath45 shell ( hereafter denoted by @xmath46 ) by means of the absorption of an oi balmer-@xmath15 photon with wavelength @xmath47 . a schematic level diagram is shown in figure [ fig : sketch ] . in the absence of a uv field , oi is in thermal equilibrium with the cmb and , as shown in @xcite , resonant scattering is more important than collisionally  induced emission , except at extremely large over - densities .",
    "however , if the first stars or black holes generated a uv background at 1300 , then the relative populations of the fine structure states 0 and 1 are modified by the two  step `` pumping '' transitions @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    for simplicity",
    "we start by considering only one fine structure transition and only later address the combined effect . in what follows we use the indices @xmath50 to denote the two levels in the fundamental state with @xmath51 referring to the lowest one .",
    "for example for the 63.2.1 @xmath32 m transition ( @xmath50 ) corresponds to ( @xmath52 ) ( see fig [ fig : sketch ] ) .",

    ". it follows then that the color temperature can be approximated by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is proportional to the number of photons with frequency @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the logarithmic slope of the background spectrum near the oi balmer @xmath15 line .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath85 .",
    "if @xmath86 is small and negative then the pumping mechanism will be more effective in the transition @xmath87 than in @xmath88 , and as a result the level @xmath51 will be relatively depopulated .",

    "the amplitude and shape of the uv photon field at 1300 at the beginning of reionization is uncertain . unlike at the hi ly @xmath15 frequency of 1215 , however , the high@xmath2 igm should be optically thin at 1300 ( see discussions of the shape of the soft uv background in @xcite )",
    ". therefore , the relevant background at redshift @xmath2 should reflect the intrinsic spectrum of the dominant sources over the @xmath93 redshift range @xmath94 scattering for these sources should be negligible @xcite , while the contribution from yet more distant sources will be blocked , because the photons redshifting down to 1300  by redshift @xmath2 will have passed through the hi lyman @xmath95 resonance ( or higher lines ) , and they will have been broken down into lower energy photons . ] . over the 0.2% fractional difference between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we then expect a relative decrement of @xmath96 of @xmath97 throughout @xmath98 , or a decrement of order @xmath99 for sources with @xmath100 . for our calculations ,",

    "the distortion in the cmb spectrum can be parameterized by the @xmath5parameter , @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the deviation in surface brightness from the planck spectrum with the unmodified cmb temperature . before computing the distortion using the spin temperature above , it is useful to obtain an order  of  magnitude estimate . because the optical depth of the igm for the uv photons in our case is small ( we find @xmath124 at redshift @xmath125 for @xmath126 ) , multiple scatterings will be rare .",
    "( note that this is different from the case of the hi 21 cm , where the lyman@xmath15 photons responsible for the pumping have a large optical depth and scatter multiple times . ) in this case , roughly a fraction @xmath127 of every 1300 photon produced by stars will scatter off an oi atom and produce an `` excess '' @xmath128 photon . just prior to reionization , assuming that a few uv photons have been produced per h atom ( corresponding to a background flux of @xmath129 erg s@xmath39 @xmath130 sr@xmath39 hz@xmath39 ) , the distortion should be roughly @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the baryon  to  photon ratio , and @xmath133 represents the fraction of cmb photon in the frequency band corresponding to the redshift range @xmath134 .",

    "is identical to that found for the hi 21 cm spin temperature . since in our case",
    ", for a metallicity of @xmath161 the relative deviations of @xmath157 with respect to @xmath121 are typically @xmath162 smaller than in the hi 21 cm scenario , and since @xmath163 , our @xmath5distortion is @xmath164 smaller than in the 21 cm case . for the 44.1 @xmath32 m ( @xmath165 )",
    "transition , the amplitudes of @xmath5 are a factor @xmath166 larger , but the relevant frequencies are more contaminated by dust and thus more difficult to detect , as we comment next .",
    "our basic result above is that the oi 63.2@xmath32 m ( and 44.1@xmath32 m ) transition could be seen as deviations in the present  day cmb black - body spectrum of the order of up to @xmath167 at around @xmath168 ghz ( 481 ghz corresponds to z=10 and 160 ghz to z=30 , for the 63.2@xmath32 m ) .",
    "the firas experiment has already obtained constraints on the deviation of the cmb spectrum from a black - body .",

    "considering the expected background uv flux at these redshifts we obtain a firas constraints of 5 ( 40 ) solar metallicity at @xmath173 .",
    "although this constraint is not yet at an interesting level , given the measurements of metallicities at @xmath174 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is the first _ direct _ constraint on the metallicity of the igm in the universe at @xmath175 .",
    "the upper limit on the metallicity scales linearly with the constraint on @xmath5 .",
    "for example , by comparing different , accurately calibrated planck hfi channels constraints @xmath176 could be imposed .",
    "an experiment able to reduce the firas @xmath5 uncertainty ( e.g. , @xcite ) by two to three orders of magnitude could impose interesting constraints .",
    "the main limitation to the measurement is foreground dust emission from the galaxy and from ir galaxies , however clean patches of the sky ( to remove the dust emission from the galaxy ) and dust observations at higher frequencies ( to remove the ir galaxies ) could be used for this purpose .",
    "of course , even if the required s / n is achieved in a future observation , there could be other cosmological effects ( such as decaying particles ; see @xcite for a brief discussion ) producing distortion at the feeble @xmath177 level .",
    "it remains to be seen , then , whether the oi distortion can be disentangled from these .",
    "one further consideration is that clustering of the sources will increase the signal greatly making it more easily detectable .",
    "the signal should trace the clustering properties of the fossil hii regions during reionization and should dominate over the primary cmb angular power spectrum in the damping tail .",
    "the clustering properties of the signal should be qualitatively similar to those of the ostriker - vishniac effect but will a peculiar frequency dependence : the signal will be non - zero only for frequencies corresponding to the the @xmath178 m transition at redshifts with non - negligible oi abundance ( and uv background ) .",
    "this will be presented elsewhere .",
    "our technique complements future experiments that will detect the h21 cm hyperfine transition in absorption because it is sensitive to different systematics and operates at different wavelengths",
    ". this would be highly valuable , since hi 21 cm + oi measurements in combination can probe the spatial distribution of metallicity directly .",
