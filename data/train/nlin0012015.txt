    "we consider the ray dynamics in a deep ocean acoustic waveguide with an internal wave induced perturbation to the  smooth ( background ) sound speed field .",

    "numerical simulations demonstrate that although this perturbation is weak , it gives rise to a rather strong ray chaos @xcite . in the presence of internal waves",
    "ray trajectories exhibit extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and at ranges of a few thousand km parameters of a ray trajectory with the given starting depth and launch angle are practically unpredictable and can be described only statistically . on the other hand , even under conditions of ray chaos",
    "the arrival pattern retains some of its features observed in the unperturbed waveguide .",
    "in particular , both numerical simulations @xcite and field experiments @xcite show that early portions of  arrival patterns formed by steep rays manifest surprising stability . due to this property",
    ", the ray travel time is the main signal parameter in the underwater acoustics experiments from which inversions is performed to reconstruct ocean temperature field @xcite .",
    "our main objective is to develop an approximate analytical approach for description of the ray motion , including analysis of ray travel times , at very long ranges .",
    "we argue that this goal can be accomplished in the scope of a perturbation theory based on the hamiltonian formalism in terms of the action - angle variables @xcite .",
    "range variations of the refractive index in our propagation model are not adiabatic and we can not use the adiabatic invariance of the action variable .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that , even at long ranges , the variance of the action variable is small enough to be considered as a small parameter in the problem .    in the present paper",
    "we derive an approximate analytic relation for the difference in travel times of two rays one of which propagates in the perturbed waveguide and another one in the unperturbed waveguide .",
    "we also obtain approximate solutions to the stochastic hamilton ( ray ) equations for the action and angle variables .",
    "these solutions are then applied to analyze statistics of ray travel times at ranges up to 3000 km .",
    "our attention is focused on the so - called timefront representing ray arrivals in the time - depth plane .",
    "we estimate the width of different branches ( segments ) of the timefront in the presence of perturbation and establish the criterion of nonoverlapping of neighboring segments .",
    "it is also shown that the perturbation causes not only a widening ( dispersion ) of timefront segments but some regular bias of the segments as well .",
    "the estimation of this bias is also presented .",
    "predictions made with our approximate analytical approach are verified by comparison to results of numerical simulations .",

    "we shall introduce another pair of canonical variables , namely , the action - angle variables .      in what follows",

    "it has been assumed that the buoyancy frequency profile @xmath33 is exponential , @xmath34 , and determined by two constants : a surface - extrapolated buoyancy frequency @xmath35 min@xmath36 and a thermocline depth scale @xmath37 km .",
    "we consider the internal wave field formed by @xmath38 normal modes and assume its horizontal isotropy .",
    "components of wave number vectors in the horizontal plane belong to the interval from @xmath39 km@xmath36 to @xmath40 km@xmath41 .",
    "an rms amplitude of the perturbation , @xmath42 , scales in depth like @xmath43 and its surface - extrapolated value in our model is about @xmath44 m / s .",
    "depth dependencies of @xmath45 at three different ranges are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "1 .              figures 2 and 3 show early and late portions of the timefront at 3000 km ranges , respectively , for rays escaping a point source set at a depth of @xmath46 km .",
    "the timefront in the unperturbed waveguide graphed in the upper panels of figs .",
    "2 and 3 has been computed using a fan of @xmath47 rays with starting momenta equally spaced within an interval corresponding to launch angles @xmath48 .",
    "the timefronts in the perturbed waveguide has been produced by tracing @xmath49 rays with starting momenta covering the * same * interval .",
    "the timefront in the range - independent waveguide has the well - known accordion - like shape consisting of smooth segments ( branches ) @xcite .",
    "each segment is formed by points corresponding to arrivals of rays with the same identifier @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the number of ray turning points and symbols @xmath52 and @xmath53 correspond to rays starting upward and downward , respectively .",
    "so , we can associate each segment with the identifier of rays forming this segment . identifiers for some particular segments in the unperturbed waveguide are indicated in the upper panels of figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "it is seen that the travel time grows with @xmath51 .",
    "this is a typical situation for a deep water waveguide @xcite : steep rays usually have greater cycle lengths ( smaller @xmath51 ) and arrive earlier than flat ones .",
    "segments corresponding to rays with launch angles of the same sign form a broken line .",
    "two such lines shifted along the @xmath16-axis form the unperturbed timefront ( see plots in the upper panels of figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "a very interesting and important feature of the perturbed timefronts is a remarkable stability of segments formed by early arriving steep rays .",
    "this property of steep rays is well - known and it has been observed in both numerical simulations and field experiments @xcite .",
    "figure 4 presents the ray travel time , @xmath16 , as a function of @xmath54 , magnitude of the launch angle . here and in the remainder of the paper we present numerical results only for rays starting upward ( for rays starting downward the results are absolutely the same ) . in the range - independent case",
    "the function @xmath55 is smooth and monotonous ( solid curve ) .",
    "in contrast , for the range - dependent case , we observe strong sensitivity of ray travel time to starting angles : points depicting travel times of perturbed rays are randomly scattered .",
    "another manifestation of stochastic ray instability in the presence of internal waves is seen in fig .",
    "5 where the ray identifier at 3000 km range is shown as a function of the launch angle .",
    "perturbed rays with close initial conditions may have quite different number of cycles .",
    "although steep rays look less chaotic compared to flat ones ( see fig . 4 and the upper panel in fig .",
    "5 ) , a magnified view of the angular interval @xmath56 shown in the lower panel of fig . 5",
    "demonstrates that the dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath54 for steep rays in the perturbed waveguide is also split into a set of irregular stripes .     in the unperturbed waveguide.,width=264 ]    the time spread , @xmath57 , for rays with close launch angles in the perturbed waveguide can be estimated as a width of the area occupied by randomly scattered points in fig .",
    "4 . for rays with @xmath58",
    "this yields @xmath59 s. however , if we select a group of arrivals corresponding to rays with the given identifier , we shall find that the time spread of these arrivals will be significantly less than @xmath57 .",
    "it is seen in figs . 2 and 3 where two such groups of arrivals are shown by thick points .",
    "so , in spite of strong sensitivity of ray parameters to initial conditions , numerical simulations demonstrate an unexpectedly small time spread for rays with the given identifier .",
    "loosely , we can state that although the ray travel time exhibits a chaotic and unpredictable dependence on the launch angle , its dependence on the ray identifier is much more predictable .",
    "this effect is most apparent for steep rays which form segments of the perturbed timefront almost coinciding with the corresponding segments of the unperturbed timefront .",
    "however , this fact does not mean that steep rays with the same launch angle in the perturbed and unperturbed waveguides follows close ray paths .    to illustrate this statement and",
    "demonstrate that the situation is much more reach and interesting come back to fig .",
    "2 . note that the perturbed timefront begins earlier than the unperturbed one and six earliest segments in the lower panel of fig .",
    "2 with identifiers @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 have no counterparts in the upper panel .",
    "the point is that rays with these identifiers in the unperturbed waveguide have launch angles exceeding the maximum launch angle in our fan . in the presence of perturbation",
    "such rays appear ( see horizontal stripes with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 in both panels of fig . 5 at @xmath54 close to @xmath67 ) because perturbation leads to widening of the interval of ray grazing angles . as it has been indicated already , in our waveguide steep rays",
    "arrive earlier than flat ones .",
    "so , it is natural that in the presence of perturbation we observe rays arriving earlier than those from the unperturbed fan .",
    "however , it is surprising and absolutely unexpected that steep rays which appear due to scattering at random inhomogeneities , form quite regular segments .",
    "moreover , these segments coincide with the unperturbed segments missed in the upper panel of fig .",
    "one of our objectives is to explain how chaotic behavior of ray paths is compatible with stability of early portions of the timefront formed by steep rays and with unexpectedly small time spread of clusters of flat rays .",
    "later on , we shall address these issues using the hamiltonian formalism in terms of the action - angle canonical variables @xcite .",
    "the action - angle variables are introduced in the next section .",
    "first , we define the action - angle variables in a range - independent waveguide with @xmath68 and , correspondingly , @xmath69 . in such a waveguide",
    "the hamiltonian remains constant along the ray trajectory : @xmath70 this is the snell s law @xcite ( in geometrical optics it is often presented in the form @xmath71 ) analogous to the energy conservation law in classical mechanics . equation ( [ snellh ] ) establishes a simple relation between the momentum @xmath72 and coordinate @xmath6 @xmath73    the action variable @xmath3 is defined as the integral @xcite @xmath74 running over the cycle of ray trajectory .",
