    "a natural question to ask in the general framework of string descriptions of gauge theories , is the quantum field theoretical meaning of pure string symmetries(for a review closely related see @xcite ) . in the celebrated ads",
    "/ cft correspondence the @xmath0 s - duality of the type iib - string can be interpreted as the string version of the well known monton olive @xmath0 duality of @xmath1 sym @xcite .",
    "the quantum field theory meaning of t - duality is however a bit less clear since t - duality interpolates different d - branes and therefore tends to define maps between yang mills theories in different dimensions .",
    "moreover t - duality transformation generally produce explicit breaking of supersymmetry .",
    "the simplest possible way to address this questions on t - duality in a purely quantum field theoretical framework is of course by defining the quantum field theory using the near horizon ( nh ) limit of d - branes metrics and working out in this limit t - duality transformations .",
    "nevertheless the gravitational description of the gauge theories related to the non - conformal d3-brane are not so well understood .",
    "the works on ads / cft studying holography are not applicable ( at least directly ) to these cases as the geometries involved are not @xmath2 .    to proceed with this studies , we concentrate on the t - duality between the different d - branes , and consider the commutativity between the nh limit and the t - duality transformation .",
    "once this is done , the nh geometries for dp - branes , with @xmath3 are rewritten in terms of `` @xmath2 variables '' . then what we have found is a metric with an @xmath2 term plus other factors , that in the allowed limits of the original papers @xcite , correspond to small compact dimension .",
    "hence , recovering in this way an induce conformal structure . as a direct application , by looking into the induced action of @xmath4 on the t - dual geometries of @xmath5",
    ", we have obtained a new kind of symmetry group , baptised as the generalised conformal group ( gcg ) , a sort of generalisation of the conformal transformations found by jevicki and yoneya in a completely independent manner in a recent paper @xcite .    in the following",
    "we study the t - duality transformation for the nh limit of the d - branes , and find under what specific limits the duality is realised .",
    "in particular as an example , the d0-brane case is considered . then a few conclusions and remarks",
    "are stated giving an interpretation for the holography conjecture in these cases .",
    "then the study on the moduli space of the corresponding sym is given , resulting in new approaches to the conjecture , interrelating nh d - branes and nh m - branes .",
    "also the appropriated discussion on supersymmetry enhancement is include .",
    "to study the holographic nature of the maldacena conjecture , we must make contact with the d3-brane case , as it is the only case where we believe that we know the mathematical structure underlying the conjecture .",
    "we also know that the d - branes are related by t - duality , and that this duality is also realised on the low energy solitonic solutions of supergravity and in the corresponding born - infeld type action describing the internal degrees of freedom of the d - brane .",
    "therefore an obvious line of approach to understand the mathematical structure of the above conjecture for @xmath3 is to prepare the dp - branes for t - duality i.e. to set them up wrapped on a torus @xmath6 .",
    "then , take the nh limit and check the t - duality of this geometry .",
    "the result of this type of analysis should be a precise dictionary from @xmath7 variables in the d3-brane case and the variables in the other nh geometries , allowing a careful inspection on both structures .    consider the case of @xmath8 d0-branes on a torus @xmath9 .",

    "much longer that $ r_i$ , we can poisson resum the expression for the harmonic function $ h$ , obtaining , \\be h(r , r_i)=1+{g_0l_s^7k_3 \\over r^4\\pi_ir_i } \\ee where $ k_3 $ stand for the irrelevant constant factors not display on the forthcoming discussions . on this solution",
    "we take the nh limit , by defining a triple `` blow up '' ,   \\begin{eqnarray } & & \\alpha'\\rightarrow 0\\;\\;\\;,\\;\\;\\;u=\\frac{r}{\\alpha ' } \\nonumber \\\\ & & u_i=\\frac{r_i}{\\alpha'}\\;\\;\\;,\\;\\;\\;g^2_{ym}=g_0\\alpha'^{-3/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is defined as usual up to a @xmath12 factor , irrelevant for our forthcoming discussions .",
    "note that the new variables @xmath13 correspond properly speaking to a blow up of the point @xmath14 and @xmath15 on the moduli space of the above metric .",

    "let us consider the t - dual theory of the above geometry , by using the busher rules for the metric and dilaton in the presence of ramond fields . in future sections we will examine this procedure more closely , but for the actual proposes it is good enough to follow the usual rules @xcite .",

    "this metric corresponds to a d3-brane nh geometry on a torus @xmath9 .",

    "we recover the flat d3-brane .",
    "this limit is related to a small expectation value for the higgs fields on the d0-brane side , rather than a small compact circle!.    the above type of computation can be reproduced for any d - brane . therefore we can obtain the nh t - dual geometry corresponding to any t - dual d - brane . hence we can interrelate the fields and variables of the `` other '' nh geometries with the well understood d3-brane geometry , characterising the global structure of the t - dual spaces .",

    "is characterized by two different moduli @xmath89 .",
    "after the work in matrix theory @xcite , it is natural to interpret @xmath61 as related to the eleventh dimension of m - theory and therefore to consider this metrics as coming from a compactification of m - theory on a @xmath26 , with sizes determined by the two moduli @xmath61 and @xmath41 .",
    "also it is well known @xcite that in the limit where the volume of the two torus goes to zero , we should recover type iib theory .",
    "this mechanism implies the dynamical generation of a `` quantum '' dimension with the corresponding kaluza klein modes associated with the membrane wrapped on the two torus .",
    "when we apply this mechanism to our case it is natural to expect to get in the limit of zero volume for the two torus ( @xmath90 ) the type iib d3-brane metric of equation ( [ m2 ] ) . using the relations ( [ rad1 ] ) and ( [ td1 ] )",
    "we observe that the limit @xmath90 corresponds to a ten dimensional type iib theory , where the extra `` quantum '' dimension is the @xmath25 circle in the limit @xmath91 , with the radius given by ( [ rad1 ] ) .",
    "the up - lift of the d4-brane to m - theory gives us on m5-brane wrapped on a circle determined by the value of @xmath61 .",
    "in addition to this , in our case we wrap the m5-brane on another circle defining the two torus characterized by the two moduli @xmath89 . in the limit",
    "@xmath90 what we get is the m5-brane wrapped on a two torus of zero volume , that produce a d3-brane with the extra dimension defining the transversional circle in the metric ( [ m2 ] ) .",
    "hence , the theory on the d4-brane gets embedded in the six dimensional ( @xmath92 ) theory on the m5-brane .",
    "as is well known for the m5-brane , we get enhancement of supersymmetry and therefore we can say that the d4-brane theory will flow to a conformal point in strong coupling .",
    "_ in other words what we observe is that , once we break the superconformal generators by t - duality , the resulting theory naturally flows to recover the supersymmetry by up lifting to m - theory_.    let us now consider the t - dual pair ( d2/d3 ) .",
    "this is very similar to the previous case . in the d2-brane metric",
    "the moduli is characterized by @xmath93 , which again should be interpreted as m - theory compactified on a two torus of size @xmath94 and @xmath49 . in the limit when the volume of the two torus goes to zero",
    ", we should recover the type iib - picture by exactly the same mechanism described above .",
    "the d2-brane is now up lifted to a m2-brane but contrary to what happens in the ( d3/d4 ) case , the extra `` quantum '' dimension becomes now part of the world volume dimension of the t - dual d3-brane .",
    "more precisely what we observed is that the compact `` world volume '' dimension in the metric ( [ nh3 ] ) is the extra `` quantum '' dimension in the type iib that we get when we compactify m - theory on the two torus characterized by ( @xmath95 ) . _ in other words , what we observe is that the t - dual description in ( [ nh3 ] ) of the uplifted d2-brane is a three dimensional theory becoming four dimensional for `` strong coupling '' @xmath96 in equation ( [ td2])_.    as before with the ( d3/d4 ) pair we also observe here that the theories flow to reach superconformal invariance .",
    "notice that these two dual pairs saturate the known examples of superconformal theories namely the d3-brane , m2-brane and m5-brane .",
    "the ( d3/d4 ) pair is related to the m5-brane and the ( d2/d3 ) pair to the m2-brane .",
    "the previous conjecture is in contrast to the mechanism suggested in @xcite for solving the cosmological constant problem .",
    "in that we can start with a three - dimensional theory that is expected to flow in strong coupling to a four - dimensional theory . massive particles in three dimensions are associated with conical geometries , when some amount of supersymmetry is broken .",
    "the suggested solution to the cosmological constant problem , is based on the assumption that these supersymmetries are not restored in the strong coupling four - dimensional limit . in our case , we have simply studied supersymmetry generators associated with conformal transformations that are the ones naturally broken by the action of t - duality , and we find they are restored in the up lifted `` m - theory '' limit .",
    "the general picture emerging from the previous discussion is that once we start with a superconformal theory , t - duality generally breaks the supersymmetries associated with the superconformal transformations .",
    "however the t - dual theory tends to flow to recover these supersymmetries broken by t - duality up lifting to m - theory .    to be more precise , starting with a d3-brane with the world volume compactified on a circle of radius @xmath41 , we break for finite radius the supersymmetries associated with those killing spinors depending on world volume coordinates . those are associated with the enhanced supersymmetry . in order to decide",
    "if t - duality breaks supersymmetry or not , we perform a t - duality to a d2-brane . once we have done that , we send the radius @xmath41 to infinity . in this limit",
    "we recover for the d3-brane the whole superconformal algebra .",
    "then if t - duality is not breaking supersymmetry we should find that the t - dual of the @xmath97 limit possesses enhanced superconformal invariance .",
    "in fact this is what happened . by relation ( [ td2 ] ) , when @xmath97 then @xmath96 and @xmath98 for finite @xmath44 , but @xmath99 can be interpreted as @xmath100 for @xmath101 the size of the eleventh dimension .",
    "thus the d2-brane becomes uplifted to m2-brane recovering the superconformal transformations . in a certain sense",
    "m - theory is there to work out the breaking of supersymmetry induced by t - duality .",
