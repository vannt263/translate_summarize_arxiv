    "the mechanisms of massive star formation ( @xmath1 ) are the subject of intense discussion even after two decades of great progress and improvement of observational techniques . in the last two decades , the development of larger and more sensitive infrared detectors associated with the commissioning of 8-m class telescopes equipped with adaptive optics has made it possible to observe ever deeper into the sites of massive star formation at relatively short wavelengths . yet , while all these improvements have contributed to our understanding of massive star formation , the basic process , i.e. , formation via an accretion disk , coalescence , competitive accretion , or a combination of these is still unknown ( for a review on this discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope is providing an unprecedented view at longer wavelengths and soon the @xmath2 space observatory and alma will combine very high sensitivity and angular resolution to probe the earliest phases of massive star formation .",
    "w51 is one of the most luminous complexes of massive star forming regions in the galaxy @xcite with multiple hii regions @xcite that host at least six hii regions with embedded clusters , all of them optically obscured @xcite .",
    "the most luminous of all hii regions is g49.5 - 0.4 which can be resolved into mainly two bright infrared sources : irs1 and irs2 , which are coincident with radio sources w51e and w51d respectively @xcite .",
    "irs2 is a compact hii region harboring three ultracompact hii ( uchii ) regions w51d , w51d@xmath3 and w51d@xmath4 @xcite and a plethora of infrared sources @xcite .",
    "the most prominent sources in the @xmath0 band are named irs2 east and irs2 west ( or irs2e and irs2w , respectively , for short ) .",
    "irs2w was identified as a nir and mir peak of nebular emission @xcite and @xcite have correlated it with the uchii region w51d .    in this letter",
    "we report the results of spectroscopic observations taken with laser guide star ( lgs ) adaptive optics of irs2e and the uchii region w51d ( irs2w ) . in the section [ obs ] we report the technical details of the observations and in the section [ res ] we report and discuss the results .",
    "finally , in the section [ conc ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the data were obtained with the near infrared integral field spectrograph ( nifs ) mounted on the frederick c. gillett 8m telescope at the gemini north observatory on mauna kea , hi , usa , in queue mode on may , 4th 2007 under program i d gn-2007a - q-34 .",
    "nifs provides 2d integral field spectroscopy with r@xmath55200 over a 3@xmath63   field of view with 0.043@xmath60.10  rectangular `` pixels '' .",
    "also , we used the gemini north adaptive optics system altair with a lgs to achieve an angular resolution of @xmath70.2  measured upon the 2d images build from the datacubes .",
    "the observations were carried out with the standard procedures for the near infrared ( nir ) : we observed irs2 in a series of three pointings of 1000 seconds on source and 1000 seconds on a  blank \" sky position at @xmath8 north of irs2 for each field .",
    "the latter image was used to subtract the sky emission from the images of the targets .",
    "we also observed the a0v star hip 98640 with similar airmass as isrs2 in order to remove the telluric absorption lines from the spectra of the observed targets .",
    "the spectra of a0v stars show only the br@xmath9 feature in absorption in the @xmath0 band .",
    "we eliminated this feature by fitting a voight profile to the br@xmath9 leaving a spectrum with only telluric absorption features .",
    "this telluric spectrum was used to correct the spectra of the targets .",
    "wavelength calibration was achieved with an exposure of an argon arc lamp obtained with the gemini calibration module gcal .",
    "all data were precessed under iraf environment with scripts written for nifs available through the gemini iraf package .",
    "we extracted the spectra through a 0.4  circular aperture centered on the sources .",
    "this aperture was chosen to minimize the contribution of the nebular emission from the hii region .",
    "we show in figure [ find_nifs ] the finding chart of irs2 .",
    "it is composed by the high resolution image taken with the adaptive optics nir camera naco in the @xmath0 band .",
    "this image is available at the eso public database .",
    "we overplotted the radio continuum emission at 2 cm from @xcite in white contours .",
    "the black contours represent the mir emission at 12  from the gemini south mir camera t - recs .",
    "all nifs pointings are represented by white squares and the sources which we have spectra are labeled . in the following section we present the results of the observations of irs2e and the uchii region w51d in the",
    " pseudo long - slit \" mode extracted from the images delivered by nifs .",
    "a complete analysis of these data , including the spectra of all observed sources and the results from the ifu mode , such as the velocity maps of the regions observed will be presented in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "figure [ irs2e ] shows the spectrum of irs2e , the brightest @xmath10band source in the compact hii region .",
    "it was obtained from the first pointing of the telescope .",
    "the continuum shows a steep , rising slope to longer wavelengths reflecting the fact that this source is under a heavy extinction : a@xmath1163 mag according to our unpublished mir data .",
    "this high extinction makes irs2e undetected at wavelengths shorter than 16000  band by previous authors is just a bright knot of gas . ] .",
    "the spectrum of figure [ irs2e ] shows strong lines of hei ( 20587  ) and unresolved br@xmath9 ( 21661  ) that may arise from the circumstellar gas heated by hot stars .",
    "we also note nebular lines of hei ( 21127  ) and the h@xmath4 ( 10 ( s1 ) , 21128  ) that come from the diffuse nebular emission of the hii region .",
    "previous authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) describe the presence of [ feiii ] lines in the spectrum of irs2e .",
    "these emission lines are typical of shocked gas in the vicinity of mysos @xcite .",
    "the spectrum in the figure [ irs2e ] does not show any of these lines .",
    "this is due to the small aperture used to extract the spectrum .",
    "actually , our unpublished line maps show that [ feiii ] emission comes from the extended region between irs2e and okym2/kjd5 .",
    "more interesting , irs2e shows co overtone emission as we detected the ( 20 ) , ( 31 ) , ( 42 ) and ( 53 ) bandheads between 22935   and 23838  .",
    "previous nir spectroscopy of irs2e ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could not detect the co bandhead emission due to the large contribution of nebular emission through wide and long slits .",
    "the detection of the co overtone in emission is associated with the presence of an accretion disc , both in low - mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and high - mass ysos @xcite .",
    "the co overtone emission comes from the inner parts a circumstellar disk , in regions of high column densities ( @xmath12@xmath13 @xmath14 ) and temperatures between 15004500 k.    irs2e is a deeply embedded source which is bright at wavelengths longer than 20000   and is not associated with any uchii region .",
    "these characteristics are those expected for a very young and massive yso that is transitioning to an uchii region ; the high accretion rate presumably prevents the formation of an uchii region as the ionized gas near the source falls onto the star , according to the evolutionary scenario proposed by @xcite .",
    "this class of object was observed in ngc 3576 by @xcite , for example .",
    "figure [ w51d ] shows the spectrum of the uchii region w51d .",
    "treated as a peak of nebulosity in the nir by @xcite , @xcite identified a stellar object as responsible for the ionization of this region based on the correlation between the radio and mir emission presented by @xcite and the new high resolution images obtained by us or collected at public databases .",
    "the spectrum of w51d was normalized and zoomed near the intense br@xmath9 line to better show the detected features .",
    "this line has a broad component ( @xmath5 700 km s@xmath15 ) , probably originated in fast winds coming from the hot ionizing star and two scenarios are possible to explain it . in the first case ,",
    "the very young star has strong winds that blew away its surrounding dust . in the second case ,",
    "the ionizing star is still surrounded by a torus that is seen more face on .",
    "however , only higher resolution data could favor one of these scenarios .",
    "besides this nebular line , we detected photospheric lines corresponding to the niii multiplet near 21155   in emission and heii at 21897   in absorption .",
    "the ionizing source of w51d can be classified as an early o star , given the detected features in the spectrum of figure [ w51d ] . comparing this spectrum with the catalog of spectra of optically visible ob stars presented by @xcite we can constrain its spectrum type to an o34 type star .",
    "the spectrum of an optically visible o3v star shows both the niii multiplet ( in emission ) and the heii ( in absorption ) at wavelengths longer than 20000  .",
    "although our spectrum can not establish its spectral subtype , the absence of civ ( 20780  ) in emission , as seen in mid type o stars , favors the identification of this object as a star hotter and more massive than type @xmath5 o4 .",
    "it would make this object one of the most massive ionizing source of an uchii region @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite classify the ionizing source of w51d as an o5.5 and o5 respectively , both based on radio continuum emission assuming a distance of 7 kpc to this source .",
    "the disagreement between the results based on radio data and the spectroscopy can be explained if the massive yso had enough time to clear the circumstellar material , lowering its density ( and the extinction as well ) . in this case , the star will not be as embedded as a hot core ( like irs2e ) and some fraction of the total number of the lyman continuum photons emitted by the star will freely escape without ionizing the surrounding gas .",
    "if this is the case , the ionizing source would be of earlier spectral type .",
    "normally , one could derive the distance to w51d using its photometry in the nir and the spectral type obtained above .",
    "however , we could not obtain a reliable photometry in the @xmath16 band from the naco image .",
    "w51d seems to be saturated ( as well as the object bbcdf4 ) and every attempt to reconstruct its psf has failed .",
    "moreover , this source seems to have strong excess emission and in this case we can not derive its @xmath17 color nor assign its extinction . without its @xmath17 color and extinction",
    "we can not derive an estimate for its distance using spectroscopic parallax .",
    "on the other hand , based on the spectral type presented in the previous section , we can estimate the distance to irs2 using the radio data available in the literature .",
    "we can derive the number of photons emitted in the lyman continuum by an o3 star and scale the distance until we reproduce the flux measured in the radio at a given wavelength .",
    "we need to keep in mind the limitations of this method , since it assumes that all photons emitted in the lyman continuum are effectively ionizing the gas , and this may not be true as explained in the previous section .",
    "some amount of the total number of photons may be escaping the uchii while other photons are destroyed by dust .    starting with equation ( 4 ) given by @xcite ( @xmath18 , i.e. all photons in the lyman continuum effectively ionize the gas ) we obtain the distance @xmath19 ( in kpc ) as a factor of the electron temperature @xmath20 , the correction factor @xmath21 , the frequency @xmath22 and the flux density @xmath23 as :    @xmath24    the critical parameter in the above equation is the number of photons emitted in the lyman continuum @xmath25 .",
    "values for that parameter can vary an order of magnitude depending on which author is quoted .",
    "we derived @xmath25 as follow : for spectral types ranging from an o3 to an o4 star at the zero age main sequence ( zams ) we took their effective temperature from table 1 of @xcite : 44,616 k for an o3 and 43,419 k for an o4 . using the geneva models of @xcite we obtained the bolometric magnitude @xmath26 for each star in the zams ( -8.94 , o3 and -8.7 , o4 ) .",
    "we derived the stellar radius from the effective temperature above and its corresponding luminosity : 5.476 and 9.2 @xmath27 for an o3 and 4.638 and 8.7 @xmath27 for an o4 .",
    "the radius and the luminosity calculated for a star in the zams are significantly smaller than those quoted for main sequence stars and may be more reliable for w51d , given its young age .",
    "finally , we used the radius for each star to obtain the number of ionizing photons emitted per unit time from the equation ( 9 ) and the ionizing fluxes @xmath28 for each respective effective temperature also quoted in the table 1 of @xcite .",
    "according to these procedures an o3 can produce @xmath29 s@xmath15 and an o4 , @xmath30 s@xmath15 in the zams .",
    "returning to our equation ( 1 ) , @xmath23 and @xmath20 quoted for w51d are : 5.35 jy and @xmath31k at @xmath3215 ghz @xcite and @xmath33 0.9767 @xcite .",
    "the radio flux of w51d is blended with that of w51d@xmath3 in data presented by @xcite , so it is overestimated and therefore can not be used .",
    "the results are : for a zams o3 star @xmath34 kpc and for an zams o4 @xmath35 kpc .",
    "we can compare our results with those obtained using the number of ionizing photons given by @xcite for main sequence stars , in this case the distance is 8.8 kpc for an o3v and 7.4 kpc for an o4v .",
    "we can not take these results at their face value , given the limitations of the method described above .",
    "however , the results can be used as upper limits to the distance to irs2 . the distance to w51 north , which may be associated with irs2 , quoted in the literature",
    "were obtained through observations of proper motions of water masers and amounts to 8.3 ( @xmath36 2.5 ) kpc @xcite and 6.1 ( @xmath36 1.3 ) kpc @xcite .",
    "the upper limits obtained above are compatible ( within the errors ) with those obtained from the water masers if we consider the ionizing star of w51d an o3o4 star in the zams . however",
    ", these upper limits would make irs2 part of w51 main just as an effect of projection on the sky , given the distance of 2 kpc obtained with spectroscopic parallax by @xcite .",
    "we presented @xmath0-band spectra of the embedded sources irs2e and irs2w / w51d in the compact hii region irs2 . the high angular resolution achieved by nifs and altair made possible the separation of the strong extended emission from the emission of the myso itself .",
    "it has proved a valuable tool in the study of mysos as we summarize our results presented in the previous sections as follow :    * we identified the ionizing source of the uchii region w51d as a massive star earlier than about type o4 based on the niii multiplet ( in emission ) , the heii line ( in absorption ) and the absence of civ in emission ; * we detected compact ( unresolved ) co overtone emission toward source irs2e for the first time , suggesting the presence on an accretion disc around this source .",
    "the absence of radio emission and the presence of an accretion disk indicate that irs2e is a massive yso . * combining the spectroscopy of w51d and its radio data , we found an upper limit to the distance to irs2 between 5.15.8 kpc for an ionizing star of spectral type between o3o4 in the zams .",
    "the fact that we detected two very massive stars , close in space , one which has cleared its surrounding material enough to probe its photosphere and another in an younger phase , deeply embedded in its dust cocoon and still surrounded by a disk , indicates that the evolutive timescale of mysos is extremely short .",
