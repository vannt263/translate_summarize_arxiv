    "inspection of the available images show wr48a , 98a , 104 and 112 as sufficiently isolated , bright mid - ir sources , with a domineering ( typically , @xmath106% ) emission coming from central parts .",
    "hence , in the @xmath10710 @xmath0 domain the average wr - pah spectrum most likely originates from the immediate surroundings of these massive wr binaries , with the pah species presumably produced in the colliding - wind wakes .",
    "both dust and pah species show surprising resilience in the harsh uv environments ranging from the centers of young , massive stellar clusters to agn nuclei ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2014 ; stolte et al .",
    "the characteristic 0.2175 @xmath0 feature is commonly linked to is absorption by pah and graphite .",
    "it was detected ( scoville et al . 2015 ) in the spectra of high - redshift , z=2 - 6.5 , galaxies , potentially pointing to an early - epoch accumulation of pah species .",
    "the 6.2 @xmath0 pah emission was directly observed in a z=4 galaxy ( riechers et al .",
    "2014 ) , and a copious amount of primordial ( z=7.5 ) dust was detected in a star - forming galaxy , a1689-zd1 ( watson et al .",
    "2015 ) . in the modern universe",
    "the wr stars are viewed as relatively insignificant ( in comparison to sn ejecta and agb outflows ) dust sources .",
    "however , the wr dust output may rival the agb yield at @xmath108 , judged by the models from dwek & cherchneff ( 2011 ) . hence , over the first @xmath10.5b years , the primordial pah species could be produced in the winds of the rapidly evolving wr stars , considering the following . the injection into ism of the pah species produced in the agb outflows",
    "is delayed ( galliano et al .",
    "2008a ) , mostly due to the relatively long evolutionary timescales for low - mass stars .",
    "thus , the core - collapse supernovae are viewed as domineering sources of dust in the very high - redsift universe ( dwek et al .",
    "2014 ) , with wr stars contributing additional @xmath109% ( galliano et al .",
    "however , despite numerous observations of dust production in the sn outflows , there is a lack of evidence that pah may be generated in the sn environments .",
    "tappe et al .",
    "( 2012 ) finds that the circumstellar pah are rather swept up and eventually destroyed by a sn blast wave .",
    "this leaves wr stars as potentially unique pah sources in the early universe .",
    "the combined 3 - 12 @xmath0 spectrum of colliding - wind , dust - generating wolf - rayet binaries wr48a,98a,104,112 and 118 shows a wealth of emission and absorption features .",
    "we link the former to relatively small - size ( probably , @xmath110 atoms ) circumstellar pah , while the latter represents the extensively studied is pah population .",
    "the assumption about the relatively small size of the ( circumstellar ) wr - pah features is backed by two agruments : by the general appearance of the wr - pah spectrum ( strong , well - developed @xmath16.5 @xmath0 emission complex in contrast to the unusually faint 11.2 @xmath0 pah feature ) , as well as by the theoretical fits to the wr - pah spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) favoring species with @xmath111 .",
    "the overall weakness of the detected emission features , 11.2 @xmath0 in particular , points to pah reprocessing in the presence of strong ionizing fields and ubiquitous wind - embedded shocks .",
    "we tentatively link the 10.0 @xmath0 emission to a population of positively - charged pahs .    though we are not able to unequivocally conclude that the pah features are formed in the dusty envelopes of the binaries , the unique appearance of the pah spectrum and especially the substantial , @xmath112 @xmath0 , systematic red - shifts of the pah features support such a suggestion . moreover , four out of five ( with wr118 as a possible exception , however only in the @xmath210 @xmath0 domain ) sources contributing to the combined wr - pah spectrum appear to be relatively compact and sufficiently isolated from any ir foregrounds / backgrounds ( both extended and point - like ) of a comparable brightness , thus increasing the probability that the weak pah emissions are emerging from the outflows of these massive colliding - wind binaries .    the long - wavelength",
    ", @xmath210 @xmath0 pah emissions in the spectra of the colliding - wind binaries wr 19 and wr 118 may arise from the diffuse circumstellar or interstellar environment , pointing to the presence of large , neutral pah carriers . indeed , the 12 and 22 @xmath0 wise images of wr118 show the presence of bright filaments in the immediate surroundings of the star .",
    "we also note the peculiar absence of the 7.7 @xmath0 pah feature in the pah spectrum of wr19 .",
