    "quantum field theory in curved space - time  @xcite describes quantum fields propagating in a classical gravitational field background .",
    "important processes described by the theory are vacuum polarization and particle creation in cosmological models and black - hole evaporation  @xcite .",
    "a black hole emits thermal radiation due to quantum effects with an effective temperature inversely proportional to its mass , @xmath0 .",
    "the basic question that naturally arises is the following : is there a way to measure such a radiation in a suitable setup ?",
    "a  partial answer to this question was provided by unruh , who introduced the idea of studying analogous condensed matter systems which reproduce kinematical features of black - hole physics .",
    "unruh showed  @xcite that the propagation of sound waves in an irrotational and inviscid supersonic fluid is equivalent to the propagation of scalar waves in a black - hole space - time . since this seminal paper",
    ", the possibility of simulating aspects of general relativity and quantum fields in curved space - time through analog models has been widely discussed in the literature  @xcite . in particular , the possibility of constructing an acoustic analog of a black hole and measuring sound waves with thermal spectrum can provide an experimental verification of the existence of hawking radiation in a condensed matter setting . in this respect , there exist interesting recent proposals to generate an acoustic metric with sonic horizon in atomic bose - einstein condensates and other superfluids  @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a serious difficulty in the semiclassical picture underlying the derivation of the thermal spectrum of back - hole radiation . tracing the hawking radiation back in time ,",
    "one has to undo an exponentially strong gravitational red - shift in the vicinity of the horizon .",
    "this so - called trans - planckian problem can spoil the derivation of the hawking effect .",
    "the gravitational back reaction also raises questions on the applicability of the semiclassical theory of gravity . within this perspective",
    ", models were formulated  @xcite with the aim of studying the effects of fluctuations of the black - hole horizon on the hawking radiation spectrum . in the absence of knowledge of the precise nature of the metric fluctuations near the horizon ,",
    "the assumptions made here are that they can be treated classically and their effects on the propagation of quantum fields can be described via random differential equations .",
    "we emphasize that this is quite different from the stochastic gravity program  @xcite , where the einstein - langevin equation enables one to find the dynamics of metric fluctuations generated by the fluctuations on the stress tensor of quantum fields .",
    "once established the analogy between black holes and fluids , it is a plausible approach to treat random media as models for fluctuations of the effective geometry of a sonic black hole . in such a scenario , recently an analog model for quantum gravity effects was proposed  @xcite .",
    "the model builds on the work of ford and collaborators  @xcite and hu and shiokawa  @xcite .",
    "two general features of waves propagating in random fluids underlie the model .",
    "first , acoustic perturbations in a fluid define discontinuity surfaces that provide a causal structure with sound cones .",
    "second , propagation of acoustic excitations in random media are generally described by wave equations with random speed of sound  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quantum field theory of a scalar field associated with acoustic waves was analyzed in a situation where the speed of propagation of the acoustic wave , and hence the sound cone , fluctuates .",
    "a stochastic ensemble of fluctuating geometries was assumed in that work .    in the present paper",
    "we take a pragmatic point of view towards seeking experimental consequences of quantum gravity effects in a specific scenario .",
    "specifically , we analyze the question whether a quantum device can detect such effects by considering how fluctuations of a black - hole event horizon affect the transition rate of a two - level system which interacts with a massless scalar field . since we are not assuming the rotating wave approximation , the two - level system measures the vacuum noise in its world line .",
    "the simplest assumption one can make for modeling the event horizon fluctuations is to assume a wave equation with random coefficients .",
    "the differential equation governing the random wave propagation can not be solved in closed form , but it can be treated in perturbation theory  @xcite , using as a small expansion parameter the intensity of the noise correlation function . using such a perturbative expansion ,",
    "the wave multi - scattering processes can be interpreted in terms of feynman diagrams .",
    "the positive - frequency wightman function is calculated at the one loop level of the noise averaging process . with this result in hand",
    ", it is possible to calculate the distortion in transition probabilities of a two - level system induced by the fluctuating horizon .",
    "although the horizon fluctuations do not invalidate the semiclassical derivation of the hawking effect , we show that predictions provided by the radiative processes in the semiclassical theory scenario may differ from those of this quantum gravity effect scenario , where the quantum fluctuations of the metric are treated using a stochastic ensemble of geometries . in this context , we would like to call the attention of the reader to the fact that hu and roura  @xcite discussed a few years ago the possibility of studying the positive - frequency two - point wightman function in the presence of metric fluctuations and the response function of a detector coupled to the field .",
    "also , a deviation from the thermal spectrum was found by takahashi and soda  @xcite using a different model for a fluctuating black - hole horizon .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss quantum field theory in the presence of a schwarzschild event horizon .",
    "we use the fact that , close to the horizon the schwarzschild metric takes the form of the rindler line element .",
    "note that the rindler s line element is static , and consequently there is a straightforward way to define positive and negative frequency modes in order to impose the canonical quantization in rindler s spacetime .",
    "with these considerations , we describe an apparatus device which is sensitive to fluctuations of the event horizon . in section iii",
    "we discuss quantum fields in fluctuating disordered medium . in section",
    "iv we present the distortion caused by the fluctuating horizon in the transition probabilities .",
    "also , in this section , using topological arguments we show that fluctuations in the horizon do not change the temperature associated with the acceleration , but only the spectrum of the thermal radiation .",
    "finally , section v contains our conclusions . to simplify presentation we assume units such that @xmath1 .",
    "our aim is to discuss a particular model for fluctuations of the black - hole event horizon .",
    "we are interested to know how such fluctuations can affect the thermal radiation due to the presence of the event horizon .",
    "therefore , let us consider the line element of a four - dimensional schwarzschild space - time which describes a non - rotating uncharged black hole of mass @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the metric of a unit @xmath5-sphere .",
    "close to the horizon , @xmath6 .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ det1 ] ) can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 . in these",
    "coordinates the horizon is at @xmath9 .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 describes the line element of a @xmath5-sphere of radius @xmath11 .",
    "the other two terms can be identified with the line element of the two - dimensional rindler edge by setting @xmath12 and @xmath13 , for @xmath14 and @xmath15 . then : @xmath16 the null asymptotes @xmath17 , @xmath18 act as event horizons .",
    "note also that lines of constant @xmath19 are hyperbolae , hence they represent the world lines of uniformly accelerated observers .",
    "one sees that , close to event horizon the schwarzschild metric takes the form of the rindler line element .",
    "therefore , in order to capture the essential physical features of such a situation , we consider an uniformly accelerated pointlike two - level system in a minkowski space - time with light - cone random fluctuations .",
    "although out of the scope of the present publication to answer the important question  what is a detector and what is the phenomenon of detecting particles \" , it nevertheless requires some discussion .",
    "it is a known fact that there is a conceptual problem in quantum field theory in the construction of the hilbert space of particles when particles are observer - dependent .",
    "the situation can be clarified to some extent by considering the response of an accelerated detector . in the context of quantum optics , glauber  @xcite , loudon  @xcite , and nussenzveig",
    "@xcite proposed ideal photocounter detectors .",
    "afterwards , unruh  @xcite and dewitt  @xcite proposed scalar - particle detector models . crudely speaking ,",
    "the so - called  unruh - dewitt detector \" is a two - level system with nonzero matrix elements of a monopole operator .",
    "the detector has the feature that its response to an interaction with a scalar field in the minkowski vacuum depends on its state of motion .",
    "when in inertial motion , the detector has a vanishing asymptotic probability to wind up in an excited state , while if it moves with a constant proper acceleration , it has a finite asymptotic probability to undergo transition to an excited state .",
    "moreover , the accelerated detector , with proper acceleration @xmath20 , interacting with the scalar field in the minkowski vacuum is equivalent to the situation of the detector in inertial motion but in contact with a bath of thermal radiation at the temperature @xmath21 . following these results",
    ", many papers appeared in the literature studying such a detector in many different situations .",
    "for the reader interested in more details , we recommend ref .",
    "@xcite ( and references therein ) , in which the authors studied the unruh - dewitt detector in a situation where the probability of its excitation is evaluated over a finite time interval .    after this brief digression ,",
    "let us describe our idealized model .",
    "in this paper we consider an unruh - dewitt detector ; a two - level system coupled via a monopole interaction with a massless scalar field .",
    "we will be working in four - dimensional minkowski space - time , whose line element is given by : @xmath22 in order to find the distortion caused by the fluctuating event horizon in the decay and excitation rates of a quantum system , let us discuss the response function of a two - level system .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be energy eigenstates of the system , with eigenenergies @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and @xmath27 the gap between the two states .",
    "next , we suppose that the system is weakly coupled to a real scalar field with interaction lagrangian  @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the world line of the two - level system parametrized by the proper time @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the monopole - moment operator of the two - level system . the quantity @xmath32 is a small coupling constant between the detector and the scalar field .",
    "it is clear that this is an oversimplified model , with an atom represented by a two - level system that interacts with a real massless scalar field .",
    "however , this model contains all the properties needed to understand the basic features of radiative processes of atoms near a fluctuating event horizon .",
    "we can define an initial state at @xmath33 given by @xmath34 and a final state @xmath35 , at time @xmath30 . here , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the vacuum and final states of the field .",
    "in first order approximation perturbation theory in the monopole coupling constant  @xmath32 , eq .",
    "( [ nova1 ] ) , the transition probability is given by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the selectivity of the two - level system , and @xmath40 is the response function : @xmath41 using the definition of the positive - frequency wightman function : g^+(x , x ) = 0|(x)(x)|0 , and introducing the variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the response function can be rewritten as : @xmath44 for a free massless scalar field , one has @xmath45 , and letting @xmath46 , the double integration would reduce to a fourier transform of the wightman function , times an infinite time integral .",
    "similarly , we shall show later on in the paper that random fluctuations of the light cone introduce an unbounded function @xmath47 that depends on the functional form of the noise correlation function . however , the transition probability per unit proper time should be finite .",
    "such circumstances often arise in quantum field theory and may be dealt with by adiabatically switching off the coupling as @xmath18 .",
    "to circumvent such a problematic situation , we assume the field - detector interaction occurring during a finite time interval and , because of this , we choose to evaluate the response function over a finite proper time interval .",
    "one should recall that the detector defined above responds to the vacuum fluctuations because we do not assume the rotating wave approximation .",
    "the two - level system is measuring the vacuum noise in its world line .",
    "consequently @xmath40 defines the spectrum of the vacuum noise .",
    "determination of @xmath40 requires the positive frequency wightman function @xmath48 . in the next section",
    "we determine @xmath48 and discuss the consequences of a disordered medium on the response function @xmath40 .",
    "in order to access the modification caused by the fluctuating event horizon on transition probabilities , we implement a perturbation calculation similar to the one used in the context of problems of fluctuating disordered media and discussed in refs .",
