    "earlier works have focused on the problem of a collisional gas in various conditions deviating from equilibrium .",
    "lee@xcite has estimated the thermal conductivity of a relativistic fermi gas , hence bringing in the quantum nature of the gas particles .",

    "in our analysis of including special relativity in the ktg and a thermal distribution , we have presented a pedagogically useful method to introduce relativistic constraints that preserve the basic collision and thermal framework that is taught as the standard approach to this subject .",
    "the method of four vectors and particle - wall collisions along with the usage of computational techniques to solve integral conditions can be very effectively used in the ug classroom paradigm to help students appreciate the interlink between different areas of physics and themselves try and formulate it .",
    "the ideas presented here give a reasonable description of the physical system but it is important to note that this approach is based on incorporation of special relativity in a previously accepted methodology and the formulation of the re function involves assuming a logically sound function , extrapolating from the mb framework .",
    "this is a well studied subject with a lot of details and results been published earlier .",
    "our work does not reproduce these results , both in formulation and extent but still presents a simple and intuitive approach for the students to study relativistic ktg .",

    "<S> a novel pedagogical technique is presented that can be used in the undergraduate ( ug ) class to formulate a relativistically extended kinetic theory of gases and thermal speed distribution , while assuming the basic thermal symmetry arguments of the famous maxwell - boltzmann distribution as presented at the ug level . </S>",
    "<S> the adopted framework can be used by students to understand the physics in a thermally governed system at high temperature and speeds , without having to indulge in high level tensor based mathematics , as has been done by the previous works in the subject . </S>",
    "<S> our approach , a logical extension of that proposed by maxwell , will first recapitulate what is taught and known in the ug class and then present a methodology inspired from the maxwell - boltzmann framework that will help students to understand and derive the physics of relativistic thermal systems . </S>",
    "<S> the methodology uses simple tools well known to undergraduates and involves a component of computational techniques that can be used to involve students in this exercise . </S>",
    "<S> we have tried to place the current work in a larger perspective in regard to the earlier works done and emphasize on it s simplicity and accessibility to students . towards the end , </S>",
    "<S> interesting implications of the relativistically extended distribution are presented and compared with the maxwell - boltzmann results at various temperatures . </S>"
