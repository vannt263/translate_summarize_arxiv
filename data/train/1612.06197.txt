    "the skyrme model has various applications in physics ( for instance see @xcite ) .",
    "the model which was proposed by skyrme in the early of 60s @xcite is a nonlinear theory of pions in which the baryons can be interpreted as topological soliton solutions of the model in the configuration space @xcite .",
    "the skyrme field has been used as a sourced fluid in general relativity , the so - called einstein - skyrme model .",
    "it has been shown that the einstein - skyrme model admits static black hole solutions with a regular event horizon which approaches asymptotically the schwarzschild solution ; furthermore , the einstein - skyrme model violates the no hair  conjecture for black holes @xcite .",
    "recently the study of the dynamical evolution of the field equations of the einstein - skyrme model with a cosmological constant in a locally rotational  kantowski - sachs spacetime was performed in @xcite .",
    "in particular for the skyrme fluid a constant radial profile oon the hedgehog ansatz has been considered and it has been shown that the field equations admit two stable point solutions .",
    "the two solutions describe an exponential scale factor for the    two - dimensional sphere of the kantowski - sachs spacetime . for a nonconstant radial profile ,",
    "numerical solutions of the einstein - skyrme model in anisotropic cosmologies have been studied in @xcite .",
    "specifically , in @xcite , the einstein - skyrme model was studied in bianchi i and in kantowski - sachs universes and it has been found that bounds on the values of the cosmological constant and on the skyrme coupling should be taken in order for solutions to exist .    in this work",
    "we consider the einstein - skyrme model with a constant radial profile and show that the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation can be solved explicitly by means of the use of lie point symmetries .",
    "furthermore , following the method which was established in @xcite for scalar field cosmology with a matter source , we determine noetherian conservation laws for the field equations .",
    "the existence of the new conservation laws implies that the field equations are liouville integrable and with the method of separation of variables we write the analytical solution of the model .",
    "lie and noether point symmetries are powerful tools which have been used for the study of various models in gravitational physics and cosmology . the symmetry analysis of charged perfect fluids in spherically symmetric spacetimes can be found in @xcite . on the other hand noether s theorem has been applied in various cosmological models in order to constrain the unknown functions in scalar - field cosmology , in @xmath2 gravity , in @xmath3 gravity and others ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .    in section [ field ]",
    "we consider our model which is general relativity with a cosmological constant in a locally rotational kantowski - sachs spacetime where the matter source is a skyrme fluid .",
    "for that model we write the field equations and we derive the wdw equation .",
    "the existence of lie point symmetries for the wdw equation and the invariant solutions are given in section [ wdweq ] . in section [ classicalsolution ]",
    "we follow the method which was established in @xcite and we use the lie point symmetries of the wdw equation in order to study the liouville integrability of the field equations .",
    "we construct the closed - form classical solution of the model , and we show that the cosmological parameters can be written in terms of the scale factor of the two - dimensional sphere , while the quantum potential is calculated .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we draw our conclusions .",

    "the variables , @xmath30 are the dynamical variables of the    energy - momentum tensor and represent respectively the mass density , the isotropic pressure , the heat flux and the traceless stress tensor , as measured by the observer @xmath31 . using this general result from ( [ te.3a ] ) , ( [ te.3b ] ) we have that @xmath32 , @xmath33 and@xmath34 where the new constants @xmath35and@xmath36are",
    "given by the relations @xmath37 and @xmath38    we define the equation - of - state parameter , @xmath39 for the skyrme fluid as follows@xmath40 we note that , when @xmath41 and @xmath42 the fluid acts as a curvature - like component , whereas for @xmath43 and @xmath44 and the skyrme fluid has the equation - of - state parameter of a radiation - like fluid .",
    "it follows that the equation - of - state parameter for the skyrme fluid is bounded as follows@xmath45      from the action - integral , ( [ eq.00 ] ) , and for the spacetime with line element , ( [ eq.0 ] ) , we find that the lagrangian of the field equations is given by the following expression@xmath46 and that the field equations , ( [ eq.a ] ) , are @xcite:@xmath47@xmath48    and @xmath49    moreover , for the lapse time @xmath50 , the lagrangian of the field equations ( [ eq.01 ] ) becomes@xmath51 where now the new constant @xmath52 is @xmath53 in this a case the field equations can be seen as the euler - lagrange equations with respect to the variables @xmath54@xcite .    in the minisuperspace approach",
    "the wdw equation is defined as follows @xcite,@xmath55 where @xmath56 is the hamiltonian operator defined by the conformal laplace operator .",

    "@xmath62 where @xmath63 is@xmath64 and @xmath65 is the wavefunction of the universe .",
    "we observe that as the dimension of the minisuperspace is two in the wdw equation , ( [ eq.08 ] ) , there is no quantum correction term , i.e. , the ricci scalar of the minisuperspace is an extra potential term .",
    "furthermore we remark that only the geometric degrees of freedom , i.e. , @xmath66 are quantized and not the @xmath13 field from the skyrme - fluid .",
    "this is because the skyrme - fluid  is expressed on terms of the parameters , @xmath67 , and there is not another degree of freedom which has been introduced from the skyrme - fluid as we have considered that the radiation profile in the hedgehog ansatz is constant .    in order to solve equation ( [ eq.09 ] )",
    "we apply the method of group invariant transformations , specifically the lie point symmetries . recently in @xcite it has been shown that the existence of lie point symmetries for the wdw equation is related with oscillatory terms in the wave function of the universe .",
    "furthermore , the existence of lie point symmetries means that the classical field equations admit noetherian conservation laws which can lead to the integrability of the field equation .  in the following section we proceed with the determination of the lie point symmetries for the wdw equation , ( [ eq.08 ] ) , and with the application of lie invariants in order to construct analytical solutions of the wavefunction @xmath68 .",
    "analytical solutions of equation ( [ eq.08 ] ) without the skyrme term can be found in @xcite .",

    "the application of the lie point symmetry , @xmath95 to ( [ eq.08 ] ) gives that@xmath96 where @xmath97 satisfies the following ordinary differential equation@xmath98 hence we find that the invariant solution which follows from the application of the symmetry vector @xmath99 is@xmath100 for @xmath101and  @xmath102 , for @xmath103 .",
    "similarly , from the symmetry vector , @xmath104 ,  @xmath105 we find that the invariant solution is of the form@xmath106 where @xmath107 is given by the following equation@xmath108 hence the invariant solution is,@xmath109 for @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , for @xmath112 .    in figs .",

    "finally from the generic symmetry vector , @xmath141 , we have the following invariant solution@xmath142 where @xmath143 and@xmath144 we remark that , as equation ( [ eq.09 ] ) is a linear equation , the general solution is expressed as a linear combination of all the lie invariant solutions for all the values of the free parameters , that is@xmath145    in the following section we proceed with the derivation of the analytical solution for the classical field equations ( [ eq.1])-([eq.3 ] ) .",
    "as we discussed in section [ field ] , the existence of a lie point symmetry for the wdw equation , ( [ eq.08 ] ) , is equivalent with the existence of a noetherian conservation law for the field equation .",
    "it is easy to see that the lagrangian , ( [ eq.01 ] ) , does not admit any noether symmetries apart from the autonomous one .",
    "however , for specific lapse , @xmath146 , the conformally related lagrangian ( [ eq.5 ] ) admits as noether symmetries the lie point symmetries of equation ( [ eq.08 ] ) ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "for instance ,",
    "when @xmath147 , the vector field , @xmath148 is a noether symmetry of ( [ eq.5 ] ) and the corresponding conservation law is @xmath149 .  the hamiltonian , ( [ eq.7 ] ) , and the conservation law are in involution , i.e. , @xmath150 , which means that the dynamical system which describes the field equations is liouville integrable .",
    "similarly for different lapse , @xmath146 , the other vector fields , i.e. @xmath151 , or any linear combination , produce noetherian conservation laws . on the other hand ,",
    "as the solution is unique and the field equations are conformally invariant the analytical solution that we find can be transformed into different lapse functions , @xmath146 .    under the coordinate",
    "transformation,@xmath152 the lagrangian , ( [ eq.5 ] ) , of the field equations becomes@xmath153    and the hamiltonian @xmath154    without loss of generality we select the lapse function @xmath155 .  the line element of the spacetime , ( [ eq.0 ] ) , becomes @xmath156 moreover , the hamiltonian ( [ cl.05 ] ) of the field equations becomes@xmath157 and hamilton s equations are @xmath158 and @xmath159 equations ( [ cl.07])-([cl.09 ] ) are the field equations for the model with the action , ( [ eq.00 ] ) .    the general solution of the field equations is ( @xmath160 ) : @xmath161@xmath162 with constraint @xmath163    in the special case for which @xmath164 the solution is@xmath165 where now the constraint equation which follows from ( [ cl.07 ] ) is @xmath166 and so @xmath167 . the last solution means that @xmath168 that is , the fluid components , ( [ te.3 ] ) and ( [ te.4 ] ) , of the skyrme field are constants .    hence from ( [ cl.03 ] ) we have that@xmath169 where @xmath170 , and , when @xmath171 we have that @xmath172 whereas in the proper time , @xmath173 , @xmath174 which is a de sitter behaviour .",
    "the latter solution holds only when @xmath164 .",
    "hence a small perturbation of the solution gives that @xmath160 and so the solution is unstable .    concerning the solution with @xmath160 , from ( [ cl.03 ] ) and ( [ cl.10 ] ) we have that@xmath175 hence@xmath176 which means that @xmath177 is expressed as a function of @xmath178 , i.e. @xmath179 .    for the line element , ( [ cl.06 ] ) , we can define the spatial volume @xmath180 and the average scale factor @xmath181@xcite .",
    "therefore the average hubble function , @xmath182 is@xmath183 where @xmath184 are the hubble functions on the direction @xmath185 and on the two sphere @xmath186 respectively .",
    "however , @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "therefore equation ( [ cl.15 ] ) becomes@xmath189 where@xmath190 finally the anisotropic parameter is defined as @xmath191 the evolution of the anisotropic parameter , @xmath192 can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where it is shown that the anisotropic parameter vanishes at a point and afterwards becomes a nonzero constant .     for various values of the parameter @xmath193 .",
    "we observe that the anisotropic parameter reach a minimum close to zero and after it becomes constant .",
    "for the plots we selected @xmath194 when @xmath195.,height=264 ]      the solution presented above is the classical solution of the field equations . because the solution of the wdw equation is known we study the quantum effects in the classical behaviour which follow from the quantum potential  in the semiclassical approach of bohmian mechanics @xcite . a method which has been applied recently in various models @xcite .",
    "in particular , if the solution of the wdw equation is @xmath196 , where now @xmath197 is not a slow - roll function , then the substitution of that solution into the wdw equation gives @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the hamiltonian function which generates the wdw equation , @xmath200 is the quantum potential and the momentum @xmath201 .  equation ( [ boh.1 ] ) is the new hamiltonian of the field equations which provides us with the semiclassical solution .  in the limit for which @xmath202 or @xmath203 is a slow - roll function we are in the region of the wkb approximation if and only if @xmath204 is a solution of the hamilton - jacobi equation for the classical field equations .    from the solution of the wdw equation , ( [ so.01 ] ) , we can see that the quantum potential is zero and we are in the classical solution .",
    "consider now the wavefunction ( [ so.03 ] ) and @xmath205 .",
    "the wavefunction is @xmath206    in order to determine the quantum correction we have to extract from the wavefunction the nonoscillatory terms .",
    "let not @xmath207 , @xmath208 , and we are in the region in which  @xmath209 ,  @xmath210such that @xmath211 which gives that @xmath212hence the solution ( [ so.m1 ] ) is approximated as follows@xmath213   \\exp\\left (   -i\\bar{\\sigma}\\ln\\left (   \\left\\vert \\bar { c}\\right\\vert \\right )   \\right )   \\left (   a\\left\\vert \\bar{c}\\right\\vert \\right )   ^{\\sigma},\\label{so.m2}\\ ] ] which provides us with the quantum potential  @xmath214 .  here",
    "we note that , if @xmath215 was a real function , then the quantum potential would be zero .",
    "furthermore from ( [ so.m2 ] ) we have the oscillatory term , @xmath216 from which we find that @xmath217 and the reduced field equations are @xmath218@xmath219    if we consider that @xmath220 , we have the solution@xmath221 and@xmath222 which is different from the previous solution .",
    "of course that solution holds only in the region of @xmath122 which we have already considered for the derivation of the quantum potential and specifically when @xmath223 ,  @xmath224 that is , quantum effects take place**. * *",
    "in this work we considered a locally rotational kantowski - sachs spacetime with cosmological constant and a skyrme fluid with constant radial profile . for the comoving observer the skyrme fluid is an anisotropic fluid with zero heat flux component and nonzero stress tensor .",
    "furthermore for the equation - of - state parameter , @xmath39 for the skyrme fluid @xmath225 holds .    in order to construct the solution of the field equations we followed a method established in @xcite , that is , we derived the wdw equation and we showed that it admits lie point symmetries .",
    "the existence of the lie point symmetries means that the wavefunction of the universe admits oscillatory terms which follow from the lie invariants .",
    "moreover , from the lie point symmetries of the wdw equation we constructed noetherian conservation laws for the classical field equations and proved the liouville integrability of the field equations we used the noetherian conservation laws in order to derive the solution of the field equations . we have found two families of solutions , one in which the scale factor , @xmath178 , of the two sphere , is not constant and one in which it is constant .",
    "for the first solution we expressed the cosmological parameters in terms of the scale factor , @xmath178 , and we derived the anisotropic parameter , @xmath192 and showed that for initial conditions @xmath226 the anisotropic parameter reaches a minimum close to zero and for large values of @xmath178 becomes constant different than zero . for the second solution for which @xmath227 we have shown that the scale factor , @xmath203 , of the radius , has an exponential behaviour .    at this point",
    "we wish to compare our results with the solutions that have been found previously in @xcite . as we discussed above , in the latter work the authors performed a fixed point analysis of the gravitational field equations , ( [ eq.1])-([eq.3 ] ) , and they derived some special solutions which describe the solution of the field equations at the fixed point , i.e. for a    specific initial - value problem of the field equations . in this work",
    "the solutions that we have presented are the general solution of the system and that can be seen from the number of the constants of integration . if we consider the initial conditions to be that of the fixed points of the field equations , the special solution of @xcite is easily recovered .",
    "furthermore the importance of this work is that the integrability of the field equations ( [ eq.1])-([eq.3 ] ) is proved which means that a solution always exists , while integrability can not proved by the fixed - point analysis . only in the region of the fixed points",
    "can the solution be approximated from the linearized system .",
    "the integrability of the einstein - nonlinear @xmath228 models is still an open subject of special interest .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that the nontrivial lie point symmetries of the klein - gordon equation are also noether symmetries .",
    "hence from the lie point symmetries , ( [ eq.13])-([eq.15 ] ) , and for the lagrangian ( [ cl.20 ] ) we can construct conservation flows for the wavefunction of the universe . in particular , for the case in which the minisuperspace has dimension two , the noetherian conservation flow is given by the expression @xmath230 @xmath231 and satisfies the condition @xmath232 , where @xmath233 and , @xmath234 ...",
