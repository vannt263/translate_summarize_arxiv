    "numerous interacting fermi systems undergo a phase transition associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "mean - field theory captures salient features of the symmetry - broken phase such as long - range order , quasi - particle excitations , and collective modes .",
    "for example , the bcs wave function provides a surprisingly faithful qualitative description of the superfluid ground state of an attractively interacting fermi gas not only at weak , but also at strong coupling.@xcite nevertheless , fluctuations often play an important role , both above and below the energy scale for symmetry breaking . at high energies , they renormalize the effective interactions generating an instability of the normal ( symmetric ) state , which may enhance or reduce the scale for symmetry breaking . at low energies ,",
    "order parameter fluctuations usually suppress the order at least partially .",
    "triggered by the possibility of designing tunable attractively interacting fermi systems in cold atom traps , the issue of fluctuation effects in fermionic superfluids has attracted renewed interest.@xcite    a framework to deal with fluctuation effects on all energy scales is provided by the functional renormalization group ( frg ) .",
    "this method provides a flexible source of new approximation schemes for interacting fermi systems,@xcite which are obtained by truncating the exact functional flow for the effective action as a function of a decreasing infrared cutoff @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite the common types of spontaneous symmetry breaking such as superconductivity or magnetic order are associated with a divergence of the effective two - particle interaction at a finite scale @xmath1 in a specific momentum channel.@xcite to continue the flow below the scale @xmath1 , an order parameter describing the broken symmetry has to be introduced .",
    "a natural procedure is to decouple the interaction by a bosonic order parameter field , via a hubbard - stratonovich transformation , and to study the coupled flow of the fermionic and order parameter fields .",
    "thereby order parameter fluctuations and also their interactions can be treated rather easily .",
    "this approach to symmetry breaking in the frg framework has been explored already in several works on antiferromagnetic order @xcite and superconductivity .",
    "@xcite the bare microscopic interaction can usually be decoupled by introducing a single boson field",
    ". however , an effective interaction with only one bosonic field corresponds to a strongly simplified representation of the effective two - fermion interaction .",
    "systems with competing instabilities corresponding to distinct order parameters require the introduction of several bosonic fields .",
    "@xcite    alternatively one may explore purely fermionic flows in the symmetry - broken phase .",
    "this can be done by adding an infinitesimal symmetry breaking term to the bare action , which is promoted to a finite order parameter below the scale @xmath1.@xcite a simple one - loop truncation of the exact frg flow equation with self - energy feedback was shown to yield an _",
    "exact _ description of symmetry breaking for mean - field models such as the reduced bcs model , although the effective two - particle interactions diverge at the critical scale @xmath1.@xcite a subsequent application to the two - dimensional attractive hubbard model showed that the same truncation , with a rather naive parametrization of the effective two - particle vertex , yields surprisingly accurate results for the superconducting gap at weak coupling.@xcite however , the flow could be carried out down to @xmath2 only for a symmetry - breaking pairing field @xmath3 above a certain minimal value . at that value a spurious divergence of the two - particle vertex was found .",
    "fortunately , the minimal @xmath3 was rather small , more than two orders of magnitude below the size of the gap at the end of the flow , and in this sense close to the ideal case of an infinitesimal @xmath3 .    in this paper we further develop the fermionic frg for spin - singlet superfluids as a prototype for a broken continuous symmetry .",
    "we stay with the one - loop truncation used previously , but we derive and apply a much more accurate parametrization of the momentum and frequency dependence of the flowing two - particle vertex , taking all singularities in the particle - particle and particle - hole channel into account .",
    "we build on recent work on the structure of the nambu two - particle vertex in a singlet superfluid,@xcite where constraints from symmetries ( especially spin - rotation invariance ) were derived , and insight into the singularities associated with superfluidity was gained by analyzing the exact frg flow of a mean - field model with charge and spin forward scattering in addition to the reduced bcs interaction .",
    "furthermore , a decomposition of the nambu vertex in distinct interaction channels was derived , extending the decomposition formulated by husemann and salmhofer @xcite for the normal state , @xcite which will now be used to separate regular from singular momentum and frequency dependences . with an adequate parametrization of the vertex at hand",
    "we can fully explore the performance of the one - loop truncated fermionic rg for symmetry - breaking beyond mean - field models .",
    "explicit results for the effective interactions , the self - energy , and the gap function will be presented for the two - dimensional hubbard model with an attractive interaction as a prototypical case .",
    "the ward identity relating the gap to the vertex in the phase fluctuation channel ( goldstone mode ) is not consistent with the truncated flow .",
    "the deviations are small at weak coupling , but they increase with the interaction strength",
    ". this problem can be treated by projecting the flow on the manifold of effective actions which respect the constraint imposed by the ward identity .",
    "we also analyze to what extent effects of the goldstone mode on other channels are captured by the one - loop truncation .",
