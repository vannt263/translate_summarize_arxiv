    "the knowledge of the mgb@xmath2 @xcite electronic structure allows us to obtain a qualitative understanding of several peculiar features of this material .",
    "a crucial role is played by the @xmath0bands@xcite , formed by the in - plane boron - boron @xmath6 bonding . due to the small interlayer coupling between the boron layers , these bands have a two dimensional character and are weakly dispersing along the @xmath7a direction .",
    "their corresponding fermi surface sheets@xcite are two slightly warped cylinders , with axis perpendicular to the boron layers .",
    "this peculiar topology results in a large contribution to the real and imaginary parts of the phonon self energy of the e@xmath1 phonon mode , an in plane displacement of the boron atoms .",
    "the large contribution to the real part of the phonon self - energy has spectacular consequences on the phonon spectrum : the phonon frequencies of the e@xmath1 modes undergo a reduction of roughly @xmath8 mev along the @xmath5a directions as predicted by _",
    "ab - initio _ calculations@xcite and measured by high energy inelastic x - ray scattering@xcite .",
    "density functional theory calculations of phonon@xcite spectra indicate that the softening of the e@xmath1 phonon frequencies when approaching the @xmath5a direction , even if strong in magnitude , is not as abrupt as would be expected@xcite for a pure two dimensional system having a kohn anomaly .",
    "the experimental phonon dispersion@xcite along al and @xmath5 m @xcite confirms that the e@xmath1 phonon frequencies decrease gradually as the @xmath5a direction is approached and the softening at momenta corresponding to the cylinders @xmath9 is very small .",
    "the kohn anomaly might indeed be mitigated by the presence of a @xmath10 band dispersion and a finite temperature . in this paper",
    "we investigate the magnitude of these two effects and discuss their relevance in the interpretation of experimental data .    a large contribution due to the electron - phonon coupling",
    "is also associated with the imaginary part of the e@xmath1 phonon self - energy , the phonon linewidth .",
    "inelastic x - ray scattering experiments and theoretical calculations@xcite show an anomalously large broadening ( @xmath11 20 - 30 mev fwmh ) of the e@xmath1 mode along the @xmath5a direction only . according to ref .",
    "@xcite the broadening of this mode is almost temperature independent , but the spectra displayed in fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite do not allow for a definitive conclusion since the e@xmath1 mode has a very small structure factor and it is seen only as a shoulder of the close e@xmath12 mode .",
    "raman data show a completely different behaviour .",
    "raman experiments probe excitations at small momentum transfer , close to the @xmath5 point of the material .",
    "the maximum momentum transfer is q@xmath13q@xmath14 where q@xmath15 and @xmath16 is the wavelength of the incident light .",
    "most of the experiments are performed with a 514.5 nm ( 2.41 ev ) argon laser @xcite which corresponds to @xmath17 , ( @xmath18 is the bohr radius ) .",
    "this region is inaccessible to x - ray measurement and as a consequence a direct experimental comparison between the two techniques can not be performed .",
    "nevertheless it is instructive to compare raman spectra with the x - ray data as close as possible to the @xmath5 point .",
    "the raman linewidth of the e@xmath1 mode @xcite shows a very strong temperature dependence since it is @xmath19 mev ( fwmh ) at 40 k and reaches almost 40 mev at room temperature , a factor of two larger than the one detected in inelastic x - ray data along the @xmath5a direction . since , according to the calculation performed in @xcite , the anharmonic broadening at room temperature is 1.2 mev , it can not be responsible nor of the large linewidth neither of its strong temperature dependence .",
    "an unexplored cause of such a large temperature dependence of the linewidth might be the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling contribution to the phonon linewidth is indeed temperature dependent , ( see eq .",
    "[ impi ] , this work ) .",
    "nevertheless the dependence on temperature is usually assumed to be negligible , but no detailed studies have been performed on the subject .    in this work",
    "we carefully analyze all the approximations involved in the calculation of the phonon linewidth due to the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we analyze the temperature dependence of the phonon linewidth and the effects of neglecting the phonon frequency in allen formula .",
    "it would be highly desirable to estimate the magnitude of these approximations using _ ab - initio _ calculation , but the task is almost prohibitive . in actual ab - initio calculations@xcite",
    "a finite number of k - points is used together with a @xmath20 rydberg ( @xmath21 ) smearing of the fermi surface@xcite .",
    "physical effects involving temperature difference between 40 and 300 k are basically invisible to the calculation , since grids having at least @xmath22 times larger number of k - points would be needed @xcite . in this case , the calculated electron - phonon coupling contributions and its temperature dependence in the indicated region would be masked by computational details .",
    "the convergence of _ ab - initio _ calculations with the number of symmetry - irreducible k - points is particularly relevant for mgb@xmath2@xcite , since only the weak warping of the two cylindrical @xmath3 bands fermi surface sheets prevents the linewidth from diverging .",
    "moreover , if there were effects such as anomalies in phonon spectra generated by the @xmath9 singularities @xcite , they could be detected only using a very large number of k - points in the phonon frequencies calculations . as a consequence",
    "the use of a too small k - points mesh might affect the calculation of both the real and imaginary part of the phonon self - energy .    for these reasons",
    ", in this work we study the behaviour of the phonon self - energy of the e@xmath1 mode due to the electron - phonon interaction between this mode and the @xmath0bands using a model hamiltonian .",

    "suppression of fermi surface singularities in phonon dispersion and linewidth : _ two dimensional systems display 2@xmath219 singularities in the phonon spectrum and linewidth .",
    "naively one would expect mgb@xmath2 to be similar , being the band dispersion along the @xmath10 axis very small . on the contrary we have shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : tperp ] that even such a small @xmath196 strongly suppress the @xmath9 singularities , so that the phonon spectrum becomes rather smooth , and the singularities in the phonon linewidth are removed . an additional effect ( see sec . [",
    "sec : temp ] ) is given by finite temperature which at 300 k completely washes out any feature in the imaginary part of the phonon self - energy .",
    "behaviour of the phonon linewidth for @xmath23 : _ we have shown that the phonon linewidth , both in its intraband and interband contributions vanishes in an ellipsoid centered at @xmath5 and having axes @xmath220 m in the @xmath28 plane and @xmath221a along the @xmath10 axis .",
    "the two values are larger than the raman momentum @xmath70 , namely @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "this calculation demonstrates that the huge linewidth seen in raman experiments can not be attributed to the e@xmath1 mode .",
    "3 .   _ temperature dependence in @xmath104 and reliability of allen formula @xmath224 and of @xmath225 : _ the phonon linewidth is almost temperature independent in the t=0 - 300 k region .",
    "small temperature effects are detected close to @xmath9 , but always less than some percent of the total linewidth .",
    "since the phonon linewidth is basically temperature independent the use of allen formula @xmath224 is justified in the full brillouin zone . on the contrary",
    "the approximations customary employed in _ ab initio _ calculations of neglecting the phonon frequency in one of the @xmath105functions in @xmath224 , obtaining @xmath225 is not always justified .",
    "along the @xmath226 directions the neglecting of the phonon frequency in the @xmath105function shifts the singularity at @xmath227 to the @xmath228 point , leading to a completely wrong behaviour which affects all the region with @xmath229a .",
    "an immediate result of these three points is that the interpretation of the broad feature seen in raman spectra at 77 mev @xcite as a phonon excitation due to the e@xmath1 mode at @xmath5 is not correct .",
    "indeed we have shown in this work that the huge temperature dependence of the raman linewidth can not be explained by a temperature effect in the electron - phonon contribution to the phonon linewidth . in a preceding work @xcite",
    "we showed that the anharmonic contributions to the phonon linewidth has a weak temperature dependence .",
    "as a consequence the temperature dependence found in raman data remains completely unexplained .",
    "besides its temperature dependence , the value of the raman linewidth at @xmath5 is not consistent with the theoretical findings .",
    "indeed we have demonstrated that electron - phonon contribution to the phonon linewidth is zero in an ellipsoid centered in @xmath5 and larger than the raman exchanged momentum .",
    "this is not at all the case for what concerns raman spectra .",
    "there are additional considerations , concerning the position of the 77 mev feature , which seem to indicate that it is very unlikely that it can be interpreted as due to a phonon excitation at @xmath5 .",
    "the calculated harmonic phonon frequency of the e@xmath1 mode at @xmath5 is indeed @xmath230 mev , a value 15% smaller than the experimental result .",
    "this has lead several groups to the conclusion that the difference might be due to anharmonic effects@xcite .",
    "a careful determination@xcite of the anharmonic phonon frequency shift , explicitly taking into account three and four phonon vertexes and the scattering between different phonon modes at different q - points in the brillouin zone gives a fairly small value of this quantity at @xmath5 ( + 5% of the harmonic phonon frequency , @xmath231 mev ) , clearly to small to justify the feature at 77 mev .",
    "this is confirmed by inelastic x - ray data of two independent groups @xcite showing phonon spectra in good agreement with the harmonic phonon frequencies , suggesting small anharmonic effects .",
    "unfortunately inelastic x - ray scattering is not possible at the zone center , so that a direct comparison of the spectra can not be performed .    in what follows",
    "we analyze several hypothesis that can be made in order to reconcile , theory and inelastic x - ray data with experiments with raman data .",
    "a possibility is that the 77 mev feature in raman data could be ascribed to a single resonant process involving the e@xmath1 phonon mode coupled to electronic excitations .",
    "this would be consistent with the asymmetric shape of the peak , reminiscent of a fano resonance@xcite . as a consequence",
    "the position of the peak would not correspond to the e@xmath1 mode phonon frequencies but it would be slightly shifted to lower frequencies . the temperature dependence of the linewidth might be different in this case . in this case",
    "it is interesting to study the peak position as a function of the energy of the incident light .",
    "a study of the dependence of the spectrum from the wavelength of the incident light has been performed in ref .",
    "it is shown that as the wavelength is changed , the peak energy position remains basically the same , even if the shape changes substantially . in the same work , from the study of the depolarization ratio between parallel and perpendicular orientations of the incident and emitted light ,",
    "it is concluded that the symmetry of the excitation _ can not _ be that of a single e@xmath1 mode , supporting the idea illustrated in this paper that the raman does not measure the e@xmath1 phonon excitation at @xmath5 .",
    "an alternative scenario is that the raman peak might be due to excitation of phonons which are not at the @xmath5 point .",
    "such an excitation can be activated by ( i ) the presence of defects such as mg vacancies , ( ii ) multi - phonon scattering .",
    "a defect breaks translational symmetry and it makes possible to observe in raman spectra phonon excitations at non - zero momenta . indeed in a similar system such as defected graphite , due to the almost two dimensional character of the electronic structure and a strong electron - phonon coupling @xcite , the phonon at the k - zone boundary has a very strong signal in raman spectra ( known as the d peak ) .",
    "however a defect activated peak can not explain alone the strong temperature dependence of mgb@xmath2 raman linewidth between 40 and 300 k. this temperature range is not high enough to change the population of a phonon at 77 mev",
    ". the temperature dependence might be explained by a multi - phonon process such as the absorption of an acoustic phonon and emission of an optical phonon with opposite non - zero momenta .",
    "multi - phonon scattering is also seen in graphite@xcite and is responsible for the g@xmath232 peak observed in raman spectra .",
