    "in papers [ 1,2 ] have been considered longitudinal vibrations in one - dimensional elastic lumped - parameters line . however in such line vibrations of more general form are possible , if we attribute the idea of one - dimensionality only to general shape of line , not to degree of freedom of vibrating elements of line .",
    "this paper investigates the peculiarities of exact analytic solutions for this type of problems .",
    "regarding stated above , supposing two degrees of vibration freedom for elastic line elements , the model can be presented in form shown in fig.1 . in case",
    "when amplitude of vibration is small ( linear vibration ) , this model can be described by two sets of equations - with respect to @xmath0- and @xmath1-projections of external force affection correspondingly : @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is angle of external force inclination to the axe of line .",
    "each of these sets of equations is similar to ones having been investigated in [ 1 ] .",
    "consequently , we can write at once exact analytic solutions for every of them .    for @xmath0-component of vibration :",
    "periodic regime @xmath5@xmath6 }   \\label{3}\\ ] ] aperiodic one @xmath7@xmath8 critical one @xmath9@xmath10 for @xmath1-component of vibration we obtain correspondingly : periodic regime @xmath11@xmath12 }   \\label{6}\\ ] ] aperiodic one @xmath7@xmath13 and critical one @xmath9@xmath14    as a result of superposition , there forms an inclined wave propagating in positive direction of axe @xmath0 ; this is confirmed by diagram of vibration shown in fig.2 .",
    "it is characteristic that inclined pattern of vibration remains as under unforced vibrations in lumped - parameters line as under limiting process to distributed - parameters line .",
    "really , basing on results presented in [ 1 ] , solution , e.g. for unforced vibration , has the following form : for @xmath0-component of vibration @xmath15 for @xmath1-component @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xmath0- and @xmath1-components of vibration amplitude of @xmath19th element which parameters are specified ; @xmath20 is number of element which vibration is specified .",
    "in case of limiting process to distributed - parameters line , we can present @xmath21 where @xmath22 is density ; @xmath23 is tension in line ; @xmath24 is distance from start of line to the point of rest of investigated element of line ; @xmath25 is mass of element of line . with",
    "it solutions ( 3)@xmath26(8 ) transform to the set of equations @xmath27    obtained set of equations describes paramertically the inclined wave propagating along the axe @xmath0 , as shown in fig.3 .",
    "we can see of carried out investigation that inclined vibrations arise far from always as a consequence of nonlinear processes in elastic system , as it was supposed before .",
    "inclined waves can arise quite naturally under affection of force inclined to the direction of wave process propagation . and",
    "this conclusion can be quite simply extended to a most wide spectrum of vibration process .",
    "paying attention to a separate element motion trajectory , we can see easy , this trajectory has form of ellipse circumscribed around the point of rest of element . and inclination of wave forms , at the cost of shift phase of motion along element - to - element elliptic trajectories .",
    "presented structure of vibration is well - known in physics , particularly in wave processes in unbounded volumes of liquid .  in a wave , motion of liquid is non - stationary .",
    "so trajectories of separate particles are far from coinciding with lines of current in time .",
    "they have absolutely other form . under small amplitudes",
    "they are circumferences in a great approximation .",
    "we find these circular trajectories as on surface as in depth of liquid . only in the most upper layers the diameters of circular ways are the most large  [ 3 , pp.300 - 301 ] .",
    "indeed , vibration processes in space have their peculiarities .",
    "none the less , it is characteristic that basic regularities are run down already in one - dimensional model .",
    "it also follows of obtained solutions that ellipsoidal pattern of vibrations of elements remains as in critical as in aperiodic regimes .",
    "consequently , in last case in the line forms compound wave fast - decaying along the line , and this is one more peculiarity that exact analytic solutions demonstrate .",
    "foregoing generalizations can be extended also to solution of wave equation in the whole .",
    "it is known that differential equation of hyperbolic type @xmath28 has general solution [ 5 , p.300 ] @xmath29 where @xmath30 is velocity of wave propagation , i.e. in the form of two explicit functions with respect to @xmath31 and @xmath32 correspondingly . till now this solution was considered the only and complete , due to theorem of uniqueness of solution of differential equation .",
    "none the less , there exists one more class of functions being the solution of differential equation ( 12 ) but not taken into account by solution ( 13 ) .",
    "we can present general form of this class of functions in the form @xmath33 where @xmath34and @xmath35are some twice - differentiable functions .",
    "in other words , given solution ( 14 ) belongs to the class of implicit functions whose regularities of behavior and technique of differentiation and integration essentially differ from such for explicit functions .",
    "important that , while for explicit functions definite systematization of differential equations has been created and for definite class of these equations the regularities and schemes to obtain solutions have been defined , for implicit functions all these developments are absent .",
    "naturally , for today correspondence of expression ( 14 ) to differential equation ( 12 ) can be checked only by the most simple way - by straight substitution ( 14 ) into ( 12 ) .    for it , on the grounds of known laws of implicit functions differentiation , find first and second particular derivatives of expression ( 14 ) with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath36 . to simplify calculation ,",
    "consider a half of right part of expression ( 14 ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "first derivatives have the form @xmath39 second derivatives after transformation and substitution of expressions ( 16 ) take form @xmath40 } { \\left ( 1-\\frac{d^2\\psi _ 1}{dy^2}\\;\\frac{d\\phi _ 1}{da}\\right ) ^3 }   \\label{17 } \\\\ \\frac{\\partial ^2y}{\\partial t^2 } & = & \\frac{\\omega ^2\\left [ \\frac{d^2\\phi _ 1}{% da^2}+\\frac{d^2\\psi _ 1}{dy^2}\\left ( \\frac{d\\phi _ 1}{da}\\right ) ^3\\right ] } { % \\left ( 1-\\frac{d^2\\psi _ 1}{dy^2}\\;\\frac{d\\phi _ 1}{da}\\right ) ^3 }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting ( 17 ) into ( 12 ) , we obtain required .",
    "similarly we can prove the correspondence of second part of expression ( 14 ) to equation ( 12 ) .",
    "thus , solution ( 17 ) defines a whole class of implicit functions satisfying the linear wave equation . and",
    "presence of new class of functions being the solution of equation ( 12 ) does not violate a least the theorem of uniqueness of solution of differential equation , because under definite conditions @xmath41 expression ( 14 ) degenerates into ( 13 ) .",
    "hereby it is proved that solution known before is a particular case of more general class of functions .",
    "the found class of implicit functions defines nonlinear wave ; its degree of deformation depends on form of functions @xmath34 and @xmath42 .",
    "for example , in particular case of expression ( 14 ) ( see fig.4 ) @xmath43 solution of wave equation ( 12 ) describes progressive wave propagating along axe @xmath0 and inclined by angle @xmath4 , what completely corresponds with inclined vibration in one - dimensional line investigated above .",
    "\\1 . analyzing solutions for semi - infinite model on free end of which affects a force inclined to the axe , we have found that as a result of this affection , in the line propagate inclined waves described by implicit function .",
    "solutions of wave equation in the form of implicit functions are generalizing for known solution being superposition of running waves .",
    "we have ascertained that under affection of inclined force the elements of line follow elliptic trajectories .",
