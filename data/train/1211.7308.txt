    "the incompleteness theorem of kurt gdel has been regarded as the most significant mathematical result in the twentieth century , and gdel s completeness theorem is a kind of the fundamental theorem of mathematical logic . to avoid confusion between these two results ,",
    "it is argued in the literature that the completeness theorem is about the _",
    "semantic _ completeness of first order logic , and the incompleteness theorem is about the _ syntactic _ incompleteness of sufficiently strong first order logical theories . in this paper",
    "we look at these two theorems from another perspective .",
    "we will argue that gdel s completeness theorem is a kind of completability theorem , and gdel ",
    "rosser s incompleteness theorem is a kind of incompletability theorem in a constructive manner . by gdel s semantic incompleteness theorem we mean the statement that _ any sound and sufficiently strong and recursively enumerable theory is incomplete_. by gdel  rosser s incompleteness theorem we mean the statement that _ any consistent and sufficiently strong and recursively enumerable theory is incomplete_. gdel s original incompleteness theorem s assumption is between soundness and consistency ; it assumes @xmath4consistency of sufficiently strong and recursively enumerable theories which are to be proved incomplete .",
    "it is noted in the literature that the existence of a non  recursive but recursively enumerable set can prove gdel s semantic incompleteness theorem ( see e.g. [ lafitte 2009 ] or [ li & vitnyi 2008 ] ) .",
    "this beautiful proof is most likely first proposed by [ kleene 1936 ] and church ; below we will give an account of this proof after theorem [ pr - unre ] . a clever modification of this proof shows gdel  rosser s ( stronger ) incompleteness theorem , and in fact provides an elementary and nice proof of gdel ",
    "rosser s theorem other than the classical rosser s trick ( [ rosser 1936 ] ) .",
    "this is called _",
    "kleene s symmetric form of gdel s incompleteness theorem _",
    "( see [ beklemishev 2010 ] ) originally published in [ kleene 1950 ] and later in the book [ kleene 1952 ] .",
    "indeed , gdel s semantic incompleteness theorem is equivalent to the existence of a non  recursive but recursively enumerable set , and also gdel ",
    "rosser s ( constructive ) incompleteness theorem is equivalent to the existence of a pair of recursively ( effectively ) inseparable recursively enumerable sets .",
    "we will present a theory which is computability theoretic in nature , in a first order language which does not contain any arithmetical operations like addition or multiplication , nor set theoretic relation like membership nor sting theoretic operation like concatenation . we will use a ternary relation symbol @xmath5 which resembles kleene s t predicate and our theory resembles robinson s ` r ` arithmetic ( see [ tarski , et .",
    "al . 1953 ] ) .",
    "the proofs avoid using the diagonal ( or fixed ",
    "point ) lemma which is highly counter  intuitive and a kind of ` pulling a rabbit out of the hat ' ( see [ wasserman 2008 ] ) ; the proofs are also constructive , in the sense that given a recursively enumerable theory that can interpret our theory one can algorithmically produce an independent sentence . for us",
    "the simplicity of the proofs and elementariness of the arguments are of essential importance .",
    "though we avoid coding sentences and proofs and other syntactic notions , coding programs is needed for interpreting the @xmath5 relation .",
    "we also do not need any mathematical definition for algorithms or programs ( like recursive functions or turing machines etc ) ; all we need is the finiteness of programs ( every program is a finite string of ascii codes ) and the finiteness of input and time of computation ( which can be coded or measured by natural numbers ) .",
