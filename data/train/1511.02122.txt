    ", such technique with single - photon heralding has been successfully used to generate non - gaussian states based either on pulsed or continuous - wave parametric down - conversion , such as single - photon fock state @xcite , optical schrdinger kittens @xcite and recently hybrid entanglement between particle - like and wave - like qubits @xcite .",

    "the recent development of high - efficiency superconducting single - photon detectors enables to reach much larger heralding rate , even in the case of multiple conditionings @xcite , and opens up the promise of a variety of novel protocols @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the pulsed regime where the acceptance window of the heralding events is defined by the pulse temporal profile itself , in the continuous - wave regime these events can occur at different times .",

    "the generation of two - photon state with time - separated conditional detections is sketched on fig . [ figure1](a ) .",

    ", the simultaneous detection of @xmath0 photons will project the signal mode into a @xmath0-photon fock state .",
    "for this study , the conditioning path is split into two parts by a balanced beam - splitter , which are detected by two single - photon detectors . in the following , we consider the general case where the heralding detections have a temporal delay and we investigate how this delay affects the modal structure of the heralded state .",
    "the time separation of the heralding events is set to 40  ns . ]",
    "let us assume that two detection events occur at time @xmath1 and @xmath2 on the conditioning mode of the continuous - wave tmss .",
    "due to the finite cavity bandwidth @xmath3 ( fwhm ) of the opo , each photon detection defines a trigger temporal mode function given in the limit of a pump far below threshold by @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",

    "we now turn to the experimental realization . the setup is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "it consists of three parts : the initial continuous - wave light source , the frequency - filtered heralding path and the heralded state characterization via homodyne detection .",
    "a continuous - wave type - ii optical parametric oscillator is used to produce photon pairs with orthogonal polarizations . in order to suppress multi - photon components ,",
    "the pump beam at 532 nm is set far below the opo threshold ( about 2% ) .",
    "the opo is based on a linear cavity with a semimonolithic configuration .",
    "the bandwidth is measured to be @xmath25 53 mhz ( fwhm ) and the escape efficiency is estimated to be @xmath26 0.9 @xcite .",
    "more details about the implementation of the opo have been reported elsewhere @xcite .      at the opo output ,",
    "the down - converted photons pairs are separated into two spatial modes .",
    "the reflected mode is used for the heralding . to remove the non - degenerate modes due to the opo cavity",
    ", the reflected mode is sent through a spectral filtering system consisting of an interferential filter and a fabry - perot cavity @xcite .",
    "the filtered light is then split on a 50/50 fiber beam - splitter and detected by two superconducting nanowire single - photon detectors ( snspds ) based on tungsten silicide ( wsi ) @xcite and optimized at 1064 nm . the system detection efficiency reaches 85% while the dark count rate is below 10 cps .",
    "note that these unprecedented features are important for our experiment : the high detection - efficiency allows a large preparation rate , which is desirable for experiments involving coincidence detections @xcite ; negligible dark noise is also a requisite for achieving high - fidelity state generation @xcite .",
    "we first investigate the photon - bunching effect in the filtered conditional path . in the limit of low pumping power , the second - order correlation function @xmath27",
    "is indeed given by : @xmath28 from this expression , one can notice that the @xmath29 parameter increases from 1 to 2 when @xmath30 decreases from infinity to zero , which means that the trigger events are bunched in time , as expected for a thermal state .",
    "such bunching effect favors the preparation of two - photon fock state .    in the experiment",
    ", we accumulate one million events to obtain a histogram of event counts as a function of the time delay between the two triggers .",
    "the histogram is then normalized by the value for large delay as @xmath31 .",
    "the normalized histogram gives the measured @xmath29 in the conditional path , as shown on fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "the theoretical curve is obtained with the parameter @xmath3 = 53 mhz . in the ideal case ,",
    "the state in the conditional path is a thermal state , thus giving @xmath32 .",
    "the slight mismatch of @xmath33 is due to the imperfect separation of the signal and idler modes . indeed",
    "the two - mode mixing will result in a squeezed state with @xmath33 larger than 2 .",
    "actually , the @xmath33 value is very sensitive to this mode - mixing and , in the experiment , the two - mode separation is therefore optimized by minimizing this parameter @xcite .      as the experiment is performed in the continuous - wave regime",
    ", the two heralding events can occur at different times .",
    "the outputs of the two snspds are connected to a fast digital oscilloscope ( lecroy wavepro 7300a ) , offering a dual a - b triggering . the time delay between the coincident triggers is set to be in an acceptance range much longer than the temporal mode duration defined by the opo cavity bandwidth .    given two heralding events , the heralded state is characterized by quantum state tomography via homodyne detection @xcite .",
    "the photocurrent @xmath34 of the homodyne detection is recorded with an oscilloscope at a sampling rate of 10 gs / s during 500 ns .",
    "the local oscillator is swept during the measurements in order to randomize the quadrature phases over the successive acquisitions . as the local oscillator is continuous ,",
    "post - processing is used to extract the heralded state in a given temporal mode @xmath35 . for each realization",
    ", we get a single outcome of the quadrature measurement as @xmath36 . in our experiment ,",
    "one million measurements are accumulated over the 65 ns acceptance window to obtain sufficient quadrature values for quantum state tomography with a maximum likelihood algorithm @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present the main results for the conditional preparation of two - photon states with time - separated heralding detections .",
    "the two - photon state fidelity depends on the delay and this dependence is characterized here for the limiting cases of very short and very long delay , and for the intermediate general case .",
    "finally , we investigate the specific case of a fixed temporal mode .",

    ", one can find from eq .",
    "that the two - photon fidelity for the optimal temporal mode @xmath20 is given by @xmath39 the optimized fidelity is therefore unity minus a small correction of fourth order in the temporal delay @xcite . a close - to - unity two - photon fidelity can therefore be obtained even though the two detector clicks are not perfectly simultaneous . practically , one can tune the coincidence window to compromise state preparation rate and fidelity .",
    ", @xmath23 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 shown in the insets .",
    "the distributions are not corrected for detection losses .",
    "the delay is set to 40 ns . ]    in our experimental realization , we first set the acceptance window to 0.8 ns , much smaller than the typical time given by the inverse of the opo bandwidth . as a result ,",
    "the two - photon state fidelity without any loss correction reaches a value as high as 58% , with a heralding rate of 200 hz , as reported in @xcite .",
    "corrected for detection losses , this fidelity reaches 79% , as limited by the square of the opo escape efficiency .",
    "in contrast to the previous case , when the trigger events are very far apart , i.e. @xmath40 , the procedure will provide two independent single photons occupying the two temporal mode functions @xmath41 .    according to eq .",
    ", the maximal two - photon state fidelity can be obtained with the symmetric and asymmetric mode functions @xmath42 .",
    "as the overlap @xmath8 goes to zero , this fidelity saturates to 50% . more generally , when losses are included , the expected two - photon state fidelity in the modes @xmath42 will be half the value obtained compared to the case @xmath43 .    to verify these derivations",
    ", we experimentally set @xmath44  ns , i.e. much larger than the time duration of the temporal mode defined by the opo cavity .",
    "for every pair of clicks with this time separation , the homodyne signal is post - processed with the four aforementioned temporal modes in order to extract the corresponding quadrature amplitudes .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] shows the photon - number distributions of the states reconstructed with the different temporal mode functions @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively . due to the losses , the single - photon fidelity is about 76% for the temporal modes",
    "this value gives an expected optimal two - photon fidelity about @xmath46 when heralded by zero - delay coincident triggers .",
    "this value is in agreement with the one measured in the small delay case presented before .",
    "this two - photon fidelity also leads to a two - photon fidelity for the case of the @xmath47 mode functions of @xmath48 , which is in good agreement with the measurements given in fig.[figure4](c ) and [ figure4](d ) .",
    "we now investigate the general case with an intermediate delay @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ figure5 ] shows the two - photon state fidelity obtained when using the optimal temporal mode @xmath20 .",
    "the degradation of the fidelity with the delay illustrates the transition from single mode to two - mode content .",
    "the last data point corresponds to the previous case with large delay .",
    "interestingly , we can also observe that there is a plateau in the case of small delay , which favors the practical generation of two - photon fock states . as pointed out before , for small delay , the fidelity only depends on the fourth order in the temporal delay .",
    "the fitting line is given by eq . by taking into account the overall transmission and detection efficiency @xmath49 and the opo bandwidth @xmath50 mhz , which have been measured independently .",
    "the above examples illustrated how the heralded states are affected by using different temporal modes . in particular , we investigated how the two - photon fidelity depends on the delay when using the optimal temporal mode @xmath17 ( which depends on @xmath10 ) . in the next example",
    ", we will consider a fixed temporal mode and show how the reconstructed states are affected by the delay .      in real - time quadrature measurement of a two - photon wavepacket",
    ", the temporal mode is typically chosen to be fixed @xcite .",

    "the solid curves are obtained by using the parameters @xmath3 = 53 mhz and @xmath64 .",
    "the slight discrepancy is due to larger photon - number components , which are not taking into account here and were minimized in the experiment by using a very low pump power .    as one can notice on fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] , the decay of the two - photon state fidelity is faster in this case than in the previous study where the optimal temporal mode @xmath20 , adapted to each delay , was used . indeed , using eq . for small delay",

    "the two parameters for the model are the opo bandwidth @xmath3  =  53  mhz and the overall intensity transmission @xmath64 . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have experimentally investigated the conditional preparation of two - photon fock states with time - separated heraldings . due to the continuous - wave light source used here ,",

    "the optimal temporal mode has been measured as a function of the delay between the heralding events . additionally , we studied the practical case where the temporal mode is fixed in the experiment by the first event . for small delay",
    "relative to the inverse of the opo bandwidth , the adapted case leads to a correction of fourth order in the delay while this correction is of second order in the fixed case .",
    "this result confirms that the small delay can indeed be used without compromising the state fidelity but should be reduced in the second case . in our",
    "two studied cases , the fidelity dropped typically by 5% for a 10 ns and a 3 ns delay respectively .",
