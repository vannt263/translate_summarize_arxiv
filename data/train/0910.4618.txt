    "recent developments in technology have significantly reduced the cost of producing and distributing content in various forms such as images , sounds , videos , and text . once produced only by companies with a large capital , content",
    "can now be produced by end - users . in today s internet - based social communities ,",
    "peer - to - peer ( p2p ) networks offer a cost effective and easily deployable framework for sharing user - generated content @xcite . while p2p networks have many advantages such as scalability , resilience , and effectiveness in coping with dynamics and heterogeneity @xcite , they are vulnerable to intrinsic incentive problems in that the transfer of content incurs costs to uploaders as well as to downloaders but benefits only downloaders .",
    "since the social cost of transfer ( the sum of upload and download costs ) exceeds the private cost of transfer ( download costs ) , peers tend to download excessibly as in the tragedy of the commons problem . on the other hand ,",
    "since upload incurs costs to uploaders without giving them direct benefit , peers tend to upload too little . the incentive problem stating that peers desire to benefit from p2p networks while not contributing to them",
    "is referred to as the free - rider ( or freeloader ) problem .",
    "various incentive schemes to mitigate the free - rider problem have been proposed and analyzed in the literature .",
    "cooperative schemes ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) utilize helpers that download files on behalf of a peer in the same collaborative group .",
    "helpers can improve the download performance of p2p networks by sharing their spare upload capacities .",
    "however , forming and sustaining collaborative groups in a distributed system poses a main challenge to cooperative schemes .",
    "payment schemes ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) use virtual currency or micropayment to reward upload and charge download .",
    "payment schemes have a solid theoretical foundation as they are based on economic models .",
    "however , they are regarded impractical because they require an accounting infrastructure to track the transactions of peers @xcite . differential service schemes",
    "( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) allow peers to make upload decisions based on the rating of a peer that requests content from them .",
    "since a peer with a good reputation is treated preferentially by other peers , differential service schemes provide incentives for peers to contribute in order to build and maintain a good reputation .",
    "however , differential service schemes require large communication overheads to determine and announce the ratings of peers . the rating of a peer is determined by its past actions , which are observed by different peers , and peers need to know the rating of every other peer that they interact with .",
    "game theory @xcite offers a useful framework to model multi - user interaction and has been applied to analyze the behavior of peers in p2p networks .",
    "incentive schemes such as payment schemes and differential service schemes have been investigated using non - cooperative game theory .",
    "payment schemes can be easily incorporated in static game models as in @xcite , while differential service schemes have been studied in the context of different game models .",
    "@xcite uses a static game model to analyze the steady - state outcome of learning dynamics under a differential service scheme .",
    "@xcite simulates an evolutionary game model to examine the performance of a differential service scheme based on peer reciprocation .",

    "@xcite and @xcite apply the mechanism design approach to build optimal incentive - compatible differential service schemes .",
    "@xcite uses both repeated game and mechanism design approaches to propose cheat - proof and attack - resistant differential service schemes .",
    "cooperative game theory has also been used to investigate coalition formation among peers @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate fundamental issues on incentives in content production and sharing over p2p networks using game theory . unlike existing game - theoretic works on p2p networks , which focus on a particular game model to construct incentive schemes , we build a basic model and use it as a unified framework based on which different incentive schemes are examined applying various game theoretic models .",
    "specifically , we analyze the basic model as a non - cooperative game and examine five incentive schemes  cooperative , payment , repeated interaction , intervention , and enforced full sharing  using different game formulations derived from the basic model , as summarized in table i. hence , instead of arguing for a particular incentive scheme and a modeling approach , we show that alternative incentive schemes can provide incentives for sharing in p2p networks from a neutral perspective .",
    "as can be seen from table i , different incentive schemes and the corresponding game models have different requirements for implementation .",
    "since the characteristics of p2p networks vary depending on their architecture , the effectiveness of an incentive scheme will depend on the network environment .",
    "thus , our analysis in this paper can serve as a guideline for a protocol designer when modeling , comparing , and selecting incentive schemes .",

    "when produced content and downloaded content are substitutable in consumption , the amount of content a peer produces is affected by the amount of content available in a p2p network . by endogenizing the amount of content that peers produce , we can capture the strategic link between producing and downloading content .",
    "in addition , we consider scenarios where the sharing decisions of peers can be enforced while production and download decisions are made in a non - cooperative manner .",
    "these scenarios can be formulated as games with partial cooperation in which the strategies of players can be enforced only in some stages .",

    "we assume that peers produce nonidentical content of homogeneous quality , which allows us to focus on the quantity of content .",

    "download and upload create costs in terms of bandwidth usage , and transferring the amount of content @xmath19 from peer @xmath7 to peer @xmath13 induces a cost of @xmath53 to peer @xmath7 ( the downloader ) and @xmath54 to peer @xmath13 ( the uploader ) , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the marginal costs of download and upload , respectively .",
    "the p2p network has a positive social value only if obtaining a unit of content through the p2p network costs less to peers than producing it privately .",

    ", peers can either collect data by themselves or download data shared by other peers .",
    "a peer can make a more informed decision with a larger amount of data .",
    "hence , benefits that peers receive from data can be represented by an increasing benefit function .",
    "the benefit function is concave when the marginal returns of information are diminishing in the total amount .",
    "alternatively , we can obtain a concave benefit function by assuming that there is possible duplication in collected data , peers can not identify the contents of data before downloading them , and the benefit is proportional to the amount of distinct data . appendix",
    "a presents a formal proof of this statement .",
    "we first study the non - cooperative outcome of the cps game , without any incentive or enforcement device .",
    "non - cooperative peers choose their strategies to maximize their own utilities given others strategies .",
    "thus , peers strategies should be self - enforcing at non - cooperative equilibrium in that no peer can gain by choosing a different strategy unilaterally .",

    "a refinement of ne for sequential games is subgame - perfect equilibrium ( spe ) , which requires that players choose ne strategies in any subgame , thereby eliminating incredible threats .",
    "subgame perfection provides robustness in equilibrium strategies in that deviation is unprofitable not only at the beginning of the game but also at any stage of the game .",
    "however , formally there is no subgame of the cps game starting from stage two or three because the stage - one choice of a peer is not revealed to other peers .",
    "hence , spe fails to provide a refinement of ne in the cps game .    in order to extend the spirit of subgame perfection to non - singleton information sets",

    "this result explains the free - riding behavior of peers in file sharing p2p networks such as napster and gnutella , as reported in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "using a similar argument as in the formal proof of proposition 1 , we can show that the ne outcome of the cps game is the same as the se outcome .",

    "there are increasing returns to scale when inputs and outputs are taken to be peers and total utility , respectively .",

    "proposition 3(ii ) shows that the no - surplus condition in the sense of @xcite is satisfied only in the limiting case with infinitely many peers .",
