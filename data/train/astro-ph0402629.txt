    "the giant hii  region n66 of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is the largest star formation region of that galaxy .",
    "it notably harbors ngc346 , a young cluster containing a wealth of massive stars , and hd5980 , a peculiar system that underwent a lbv - type eruption at the end of the last century . _ rosat _  and _ asca _ observations have also revealed the presence of a few x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) in this field ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some of which were later found to harbor pulsars ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "recently , a new generation of powerful x - ray observatories has been launched and the xmega consortium used this opportunity to observe the x - ray emission from the ngc346 field in greater detail .",
    "the results of a 100  ks @xmath0 observation have been given in two previous articles .",
    "in naz et al .",
    "( 2003a , hereafter paper i ) , we reported the first detections in the x - ray domain of the cluster and hd5980 .",
    "the x - ray emission from ngc346 appeared tightly correlated with the cluster s core , while that of hd5980  was found to be bright and variable on the short timescale . in naz",
    "( 2003b , hereafter paper ii ) , we analyzed the x - ray properties of the 75 point sources discovered in the field , and found possible counterparts to 32 of these sources .",
    "we refer the reader to these papers for detailed results and a thorough introduction to the importance of the ngc346 field .",
    "this third paper of the series is meant to supplement the two previous ones .",
    "here , we continue our investigation of the field with the analysis of two _ xmm - newton _  datasets , which provide a wider field compared to the _ chandra _ data and allow us to examine the issue of source variability on timescales of seconds to months .",
    "the observations and data reduction are presented in  2 .",
    "next , the properties of the sources detected by _ xmm - newton _  are discussed in  3 , where they are also compared to previous data available . in  4 , we focus the discussion on hd5980 , the supernova remnant snr0056@xmath172.5 , and the xrbs . we conclude in  5 .",
    "ngc346 was observed once with the _ chandra _ observatory and twice with the _ xmm - newton _  satellite .",
    "the _ chandra _ data , taken on 2001 may 15 - 16 for 100 ks , have been extensively analyzed in papers i and ii , and we will focus here only on the _ xmm - newton _  data .",
    "the first _ xmm - newton _   observation took place during revolution 0157 , on oct .",
    "17 2000 for about 20 ks .",
    "it is a public dataset part of the _ xmm - newton _  science archive .",
    "the second observation , of length @xmath230 ks , was obtained by our group during revolution 0357 , on nov .",
    "20 - 21 2001 .",
    "the epic mos cameras @xcite were used in full frame mode during both revolutions , while the epic pn camera @xcite was used in full frame mode during rev .",
    "0357 and in extended full frame mode during rev .",
    "for both observations , a medium filter was added to reject optical light .",
    "we used the science analysis software ( sas ) version 5.4.1 .",
    "@xcite to reduce the epic data .",
    "these data were first processed through the pipeline chains , and then filtered . for epic mos ,",
    "only events with a pattern between 0 and 12 and passing through the # xmmea_em filter ( i.e. flag&0x766b000=0 ) were considered . for epic pn , we kept events with flag@xmath30 and a pattern between 0 and 4 .",
    "the resulting exposure times were 19.6  ks ( epic mos ) and 15.5  ks ( epic pn ) for rev .",
    "0157 , and 26.7  ks ( epic mos ) and 21.7  ks ( epic pn ) for rev .",
    "0357 .    to search for contamination by low energy protons",
    ", we have further examined the light curve at high energies ( pi@xmath410000 , approximately corresponding to energies @xmath410  kev , and with pattern@xmath30 ) . throughout both observations , a rather large high energy count rate ( on average , 0.25  cts  s@xmath5 for epic mos and 1.25  cts  s@xmath5 for epic pn )",
    "was detected but since no clear flare is present , we decided to keep the whole exposure in both cases .",
    "further analysis was performed using the sas version 5.4.1 . and the ftools tasks @xcite .",
    "the spectra were analyzed and fitted within xspec v11.0.1 @xcite .",
    "the combined epic images of the ngc346 field of both _ xmm - newton_datasets are shown in fig .",
    "[ totalfield ] .",
    "several point sources can be spotted throughout the field and some of them are clearly seen to vary between the two observations . to create a catalog of these discrete x - ray sources",
    ", we applied for each observation the sas detection meta - task _ edetect_chain _ simultaneously to the data from all three epic cameras .",
    "due to the rather high background during these observations , we decided to restrict the energy range to 0.4@xmath14.0  kev , and then created images in the following three energy bands for input in _",
    "edetect_chain _ : s=0.4@xmath11.0  kev , m=1.0@xmath12.0  kev and h=2.0@xmath14.0  kev .",
    "we eliminated false detections due to structures in the extended emission near hd5980 , gaps , or remaining bad pixels and bad columns .",
    "we also rejected sources with a small detection likelihood ( i.e.  with a logarithmic likelihood in one detector @xmath6 and/or a combined likelihood for the three detectors @xmath7 ) .",
    "we have compared the lists found in each case and finally constructed a definitive list of 51 sources ) , only 20 sources remain , but some obvious , bright x - ray sources are not part of this restricted list and in addition , some of the `` secure detections '' are actually the same source detected twice . a good source list for this field thus still needed to be made . ] which are presented in table [ crate ] by increasing right ascension ( ra ) .",
    "note that 29 of these were already detected in our _ chandra _ observation : for these sources , we will use the _ chandra _ source number from paper ii , which will be quoted as [ nhs03 ] # throughout this paper , whereas for the sources specific to the _ xmm - newton _  observations , we will use a letter as identifier .",
    "most of the undetected _ chandra _ sources have an acis - i count rate smaller than @xmath8  cts  s@xmath5 ( see also  3.3 ) .",
    "this is not surprising since the smallest _ xmm - newton _",
    "count rates detected in our observations are about @xmath9  cts  s@xmath5 for epic mos and @xmath10  cts  s@xmath5 for epic pn .",
    "this detection threshold is roughly an order of magnitude larger than for _ chandra _",
    "( @xmath11  cts  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "the smaller exposure time , combined with the loss of resolution due to the larger point spread function ( psf ) of _ xmm - newton _  and a rather high background explain why we detect only one third of the _ chandra _ sources .",
    "the count rates of the sources in each instrument are also presented in table [ crate ] .",
    "a missing count rate indicates a source ( at least partly ) in gaps or out of the field - of - view ( fov ) for the instrument considered . if the task _ edetect_chain _ provides vignetting- and background - corrected count rates , an additional correction is needed .",
    "following the user support group , it actually appears that the sas task _ eexpmap _ , used by the meta - task _ edetect_chain _ , does not consider all the necessary exposure information .",
    "in particular , it neglects out - of - time ( oot ) and deadtime corrections . if this is negligible for the epic mos data , not correcting for oot events in the epic pn data implies an overestimation of the exposure time ( and thus an underestimation of the count rates ) by 6.3% for the full frame mode ( rev .",
    "0357 ) and 2.3% for the extended full frame mode ( rev .",
    "we thus have corrected the pn count - rates provided by _",
    "edetect_chain _ by this amount , and the result is shown in table [ crate ] .",
    "the presented hardness ratios hr1 and hr2 have been calculated for the pn data as ( m@xmath1s)/(m+s ) and ( h@xmath1m)/(h+m ) , respectively .",
    "the last column of table [ crate ] yields information on the nature of the x - ray source ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or of its counterpart ( paper ii and table [ wfi ] ) .",
    "in addition to these point sources and the supernova remnant ( snr ) near hd5980 , we note the possible presence of extended emission north of source e and near position 0@xmath1258@xmath1325@xmath14 @xmath172@xmath150040 , but their low surface brightness did not permit to derive any precise physical information on these extended emissions .      for the 12 brightest sources",
    ", we extracted the sources spectra in circles of minimum radius 25 , and chose annuli surrounding the sources or nearby circles for background subtraction . using the sas s _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen _ tools we then generated the response matrix file and ancillary reponse file , necessary to any spectral analysis .",
    "the spectra were finally binned to obtain at least 10 cts per bin , and were then analyzed within xspec .",
    "bins with energies below 0.4  kev or above 10.0  kev were discarded . since their signal - to - noise was generally rather low ,",
    "the spectra were fitted with simple models , i.e. an absorbed power - law or an absorbed @xmath16 model .",
    "as fits to the mos and pn spectra generally gave similar results , within the errors , we chose to fit simultaneously all epic data available for a particular observation to get the smallest errors .",
    "the results of these fits are presented in table [ spec ] , but @xmath16 models @xcite with unconstrained and unrealistically high temperatures ( i.e. @xmath17  kev ) were not included in that table .",
    "we caution that the abundance specific to the smc , @xmath18 , was used only for the @xmath16 models , not for the absorbing column ( like e.g. in * ? ? ?",
    "absorbing columns larger than @xmath19  @xmath20 may indicate absorption in addition to the galactic column .",
    "if this excess absorption is caused by low metallicity smc material , the smc absorbing column can be derived by multiplying the excess column by a factor of 10 .",
    "the spectral properties of eight of our sources were also determined by two other teams @xcite .",
    "the properties derived here are generally in good agreement with their values , since the confidence intervals overlap for all sources except [ nhs03]75 . in this last case ,",
    "the spectral changes might actually be real , since the source is a varying x - ray binary ( see   3.3.2 and 4.3 ) .      for counterparts to the 29 _ xmm - newton _  sources which are in common with the _ chandra _ observation",
    ", we refer the reader to the extensive discussion of paper ii , which we will not repeat here . to search for optical counterparts to the remaining x - ray sources",
    ", we have followed a procedure similar to that of paper ii .",
    "we have first cross - correlated the source list with the public databases ( usno b1.0 , gsc 2.2 , 2mass all sky survey ) and then with our wide field imager ( wfi ) data . before correlating our source list with these optical databases ,",
    "we have determined the mean shifts between _ chandra _ and each _ xmm - newton _  observation .",
    "since there exists a shift of + 16 in ra and @xmath112 in dec between actual world coordinates and _ chandra _ s ( see paper ii ) , we applied a shift of + 0.26s in ra to coordinates of rev . 0357 and + 2   in dec for rev .",
    "all objects within 5  - the psf width of _ xmm - newton _  - of the x - ray sources were considered as possible counterparts and are listed in table [ wfi ] .",
    "[ colmag ] presents a color - magnitude diagram similar to fig .",
    "6 of paper ii .",
    "the majority of the sources are within the main sequence of ngc 346 but the counterparts of sources i & n appear as slightly evolved early - type stars and that a few counterparts ( a , b , q ) apparently belong to a second population of the smc , that is not physically associated with the ngc346 cluster itself .",
    "we have also compared our source list to the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ catalogs of smc x - ray sources ( kahabka et al .",
    "1999 ; haberl et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter [ hfp2000 ] ; sasaki , haberl , & pietsch 2000 , hereafter [ shp2000 ] ; yokogawa et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter [ yit2000 ] ) .",
    "thirteen of the 22 _ xmm - newton _  sources were previously detected and we noted in table [ wfi ] their _ rosat _  or _ asca _ identification .",
    "we have also analyzed the lightcurves of these 12 brightest sources .",
    "using the same regions as in  3.1 , we created lightcurves for each source and associated background region .",
    "the sources lightcurves were then background - subtracted , corrected for good time intervals , and analyzed with our own software .",
    "using kolmogorov - smirnov , @xmath21 , and modified probability of variability ( see sana et al .",
    "2004 ) tests , we found no source significantly variable in all three epic cameras during a single observation .      in paper",
    "i and ii , we have extensively analyzed the sources detected by _",
    "chandra_. among other properties , we have determined the detailed spectral characteristics of 15 acis - i sources .",
    "four out of these 15 sources were bright enough to provide a valuable epic spectra that can be compared with our previous results ( see paper ii and table [ spec ] ) .",
    "all epic spectra present a lower absorption column , compared to _",
    ". this systematic difference could most probably be attributed to calibration problems at low energies , since the calibrations of both satellites are still ongoing ( in particular due to the recently discovered degradation of the acis low energy quantum efficiency ) .",
    "in addition , these sources also present a clearly variable x - ray luminosity over the three observations :    * [ nhs03 ]  4 has approximately the same flux in the _ chandra _ data as in the _ xmm - newton _  rev .",
    "0157 data , but it increased by 70% in the last _ xmm - newton _  observation . * [ nhs03 ]  6 presents similar characteristics in the _ chandra _ data and the first _ xmm - newton _  observation , but the power law steepens and the flux has dramatically decreased by a factor of @xmath225 in the last _ xmm - newton _  observation . * [ nhs03 ]  60 has a flux reduced by at least a factor 3 in the _ chandra _ observation , compared to the _ xmm - newton _  ones . with its rather large absorbing column and large power law energy slope @xmath22 ,",
    "it is considered in @xcite as a possible agn candidate .",
    "* [ nhs03 ]  69 presents only a small increase of flux ( @xmath220% ) in the last _ xmm - newton _  observation , and marginal variations of the power law s exponent .",
    "the spectral characteristics of ten additional _ chandra _ sources are known , but they present too few counts in the _ xmm - newton _  observations to give any meaningful spectrum . to detect possible variations for these sources",
    ", we used the spectral information from paper ii and pimms and @xmath23 ( the lowest available ) were used for the mekal models . ] to predict the _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic count rates , which we have then compared directly to the observed ones , since the output of the task _",
    "edetect_chain _ is an equivalent on - axis count rate . by this procedure ,",
    "we detected no flux variation for [ nhs03 ]  1 , 19 , 20 , 29 , 30 , and 70 , but four additional varying sources were also found :    * using the _ chandra _  data , we expect [ nhs03 ]  10 and 71 to be brighter by 40% ( epic mos ) and 200% ( epic pn ) for the former , and 10% ( epic mos ) and 50% ( epic pn ) for the latter . * the expected epic pn count rate of [ nhs03 ]  24 is a factor @xmath24 larger than the value observed at rev .",
    "however , this can not be confirmed by the epic mos data of rev .",
    "0157 , since the source falls in a detector gap at that time .",
    "* [ nhs03 ]  46 possesses an _ xmm - newton _",
    "count rate double of what is expected on the basis of the _ chandra _ data .",
    "we also note that the _ chandra _ sources [ nhs03 ]  23 , 37 , 47 , and 61 are detected with _",
    "xmm - newton _ although they possessed an acis - i count rate smaller than @xmath8  cts  s@xmath5 , i.e. so small that it should have prevented their detection by _ xmm - newton_. on the contrary , [ nhs03 ]  45 and 49 remain undetected ( with _ xmm - newton _",

    "_ count rate ( 9.8 and 11.0 @xmath26  cts  s@xmath5 , respectively ) . these six sources may be added to the list of variable x - ray sources .",
    "in addition , for the sources out of _ chandra _ acis - i fov , we can compare directly the count rates and/or spectral properties between both _ xmm - newton _  observations and we found 7 additional varying sources :    * [ nhs03 ]  75 has undergone a dramatic increase of luminosity by a factor @xmath223 in the last _ xmm - newton _  observation .",
    "as for [ nhs03 ]  6 , the power law steepened when the flux was lowest ( see fig .",
    "[ spec75 ] ) .",
    "* source g has a slightly lower flux ( a 15% decrease ) in the last _ xmm - newton _  observation and the flux of source i is larger by 60% in the first _ xmm - newton _  observation . regarding the nature of these sources",
    ", we may note that with its large absorbing column and @xmath22 , source g is a good agn candidate , whereas source i possesses a bright blue counterpart indicating a possible x - ray binary nature ( see  4.3 for more details ) .",
    "* source l exhibited a luminosity decrease by 75% in the data from rev .",

    "has increased by 75% in the last _ xmm - newton _   observation .",
    "* source s has experienced an increase of 50% in the power law exponent , associated with a decrease of the flux by a factor of 2 in the last _ xmm - newton _  observation .",
    "this variation is similar to the behavior exhibited by [ nhs03 ]  6 and 75 . *",
    "the flux of source v has doubled in the last _ xmm - newton _  observation .",
    "there were also some 13 sources detected only in one of the two _ xmm - newton _   observations .",
    "however , most of these sources possess a very low count rate , close to the detection limit ( @xmath27  cts  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "their absence could well be explained by a simple statistical fluctuation , and the upper limits derived in the observation where they are missing are compatible with a constant count rate ( see table [ crate ] ) . by comparing the observed count rates in one dataset to the upper limits calculated for the other _ xmm - newton _  observation , we nevertheless inferred count rate variations for source n , of at least 20% in epic mos , and at least 170% for epic pn .",
    "in addition , a large luminosity decrease is detected for source d. this source is at best marginally detected in the _ xmm - newton _  data of rev .",
    "0357 , while it is one of the brightest sources in the _ xmm - newton _  observation made at rev .",
    "0157 : the count rate of this source changes by a factor of at least 25 between the two _ xmm - newton _  observations .",
    "in addition to finding pulses with a period of 280.4s , @xcite already discovered dramatic flux variations for this source by comparing _",
    "rosat _   and _ asca _ observations , making source d one of the most interesting x - ray binaries of this field .",
    "comparing with older x - ray catalogs , we also note that the _ rosat _  sources [ hfp2000 ] 103 , 173 , 185 , 186 , 207 and [ kpf99 ] 157 are missing in the _ xmm - newton _   observation . since these six _ rosat _",
    "sources were not particularly faint _ rosat _  sources , their non - detection suggests a strongly variable nature . using the sas task @xmath28 for a likelihood of 10 ,",
    "we derived upper limits on the _ xmm - newton _  count rate of these sources of @xmath29  cts  s@xmath5 for epic mos and @xmath30  cts  s@xmath5 for epic pn .",
    "we note however that [ hfp2000 ] 186 was already undetected in the _ chandra _ observation ( see paper ii ) , i.e. its acis - i count rate was lower than @xmath11  cts  s@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the acis - i count rates of the _ rosat _   sources [ hfp2000 ] 173 and 185 ( = [ nhs03 ]  11 and 16 in paper ii ) were very low , about @xmath31  cts  s@xmath5 , in our _ chandra _   data .",
    "if these three sources did not change since then , they are well below the detection threshold of our _ xmm - newton _  observations .",
    "we reported the first detection of hd5980  at x - ray energies in paper i. but this peculiar star was also observed twice by _ xmm - newton _  and in fact , the _ xmm - newton _  data of rev .",
    "0157 , which were taken before the _ chandra _   observation , constitute the first actual detection of hd5980  in x - rays .",

    "[ hd5980 ] .",
    "there is no significant change between the _ xmm - newton _  data from rev . 0357 and the @xmath0 observation , but the x - ray luminosity of hd5980  has clearly increased during the first _ xmm - newton _  observation .",
    "this variation is particularly well seen in the harder range , which is not surprising since the emission from the snr dominates at low energies .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray emission of a colliding - wind system like hd5980   is expected to vary as 1/@xmath35 ( @xmath35 being the separation between the components ) and it should thus be larger at periastron .",
    "we do not observe such a variation , but the effects of a varying absorption column might explain the observed changes",
    ". however , hd5980  is known to present secular variations in the optical domain : with only three observations , it is not yet possible to disentangle the possible long - term variations of the x - ray luminosity ( for example related to the 1994 eruption ) from systematic changes linked to the orbital motion .",
    "a more complete discussion about hd5980  variations will be presented by flores et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , but we already note that a monitoring of hd5980  with the _ chandra _ satellite ( the only one easily capable of disentangling hd5980  from the snr ) would be of utmost interest to better constrain the system s physical characteristics .",
    "apart from the snr surrounding hd5980 , a second supernova remnant is present in the _ xmm - newton _  fov : source e. as could be expected from such an object , this source did not vary between either of the _ xmm - newton _   observations .",

    "this radio source has a size of 100@xmath3680  ( or 160@xmath36160   if we use the lower contours of ye et al . ) .",
    "the x - ray source corresponds exactly with the peak of the radio source and , as far as the _ xmm - newton _  resolution can conclude5 , corresponds to a rather large linear size in the smc ( 1.4  pc ) . ] , the _ xmm - newton _  source is point - like , i.e. not extended as in the radio range .",
    "however , its x - ray luminosity ( @xmath37 erg s@xmath5 ) is quite large for a putative isolated neutron star born in the supernova event @xcite .",
    "the source also presents a rather hard spectra , that was well fitted by a power - law of energy slope @xmath38 but not by a thermal model ( @xmath39 of 4 to 50  kev ) .",
    "finally , some faint extended emission may also be present to the north of the x - ray source , and it correlates well with an extension of the source at radio wavelengths .",
    "six x - ray binary candidates were proposed in our _ xmm - newton _   fov by @xcite : [ nhs03 ]  4 , 6 & 70 ; and sources d , s & v. their status as xrbs is now confirmed by a large body of evidence .",
    "the x - ray sources [ nhs03 ]  6 & 70 , and d & s were found to pulsate @xcite  6 over the _ chandra _ exposure , which we reported in paper ii . ] .",

    "moreover , of these six sources , only [ nhs03 ]  70 appear to stay at a stable low luminosity level since 2000 oct .",
    "in addition , all but [ nhs03 ]  4 possess an emission - line , early - type counterpart ( see e.g. paper ii ) .",
    "however , the candidate counterpart of source v ( [ ma93 ] 1277 , see sasaki , pietsch , & haberl 2003 ) lies rather far away from the x - ray source ( @xmath46 , a distance much larger than for the other xrb counterparts ) . although the error on the position of this x - ray source should be larger since it is quite far off - axis ( @xmath211 ) , this large distance might eventuelly cast doubt on the identification of source v with [ ma93 ] 1277 .",
    "a few other xrb candidates have recently been proposed by @xcite : [ nhs03 ]  75 , and sources i & n. the varying character of these sources , confirmed by our new _ xmm - newton _  observation , and the presence of a bright blue counterpart left little doubt about their xrb nature .",
    "this is especially true for source i , discovered recently to pulsate in the x - ray domain @xcite .",
    "in addition , we observe a clear variation of the flux of [ nhs03 ]  69 in the last _ xmm - newton _  observation .",
    "since pulses were also detected for this source by @xcite , its identification as an x - ray binary is extremely likely .    in paper ii , because of the estimated spectral types of their counterparts or due to their variable nature",
    ", we had also tentatively proposed a few new xrb candidates . of these , [ nhs03 ]  3 , 9 and 34 were unfortunately too faint to be detected by _ xmm - newton _ , and [ nhs03 ]  61 and 68 do not show any flux variation between the _ xmm - newton _  observations .",
    "however , [ nhs03 ]  10 and 71 present small variations : these sources should be considered as the best choices for future studies of xrb candidates . outside the _ chandra _ fov",
    ", another x - ray source may constitute an additional xrb candidate : source u. we estimated a b spectral type for its counterpart ( see table [ wfi ] ) but no variations of the x - ray properties of the source were detected between our two _ xmm - newton _  observations .",
    "such a large number of xrbs in the smc is not at all surprising ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a precise knowledge of their exact number and physical properties may enable us to better constrain their dependence on metallicity .",
    "the next step will be to monitor the counterparts of all these sources to find the physical parameters of these systems , and especially to determine the exact nature of the accretor .",
    "finally , the variability of the other sources described in  3.3 is an interesting new discovery , that can give hints on the exact nature of these sources",
    ". they might be additional x - ray binaries , or varying extragalactic sources ( agns ) .",
    "in this context , we may note that using the formalism of @xcite , we expect about 20 extragalactic sources in this field .",
    "such sources should be well fitted by power - laws , but should also display a large absorbing column .",
    "the large slopes @xmath22 of [ nhs03 ]  24 , 46 , & 60 and of sources g & l may indicate that these sources are likely agns .",
    "note however that amongst these , only source g has a very large absorption column .",
    "moreover , the known x - ray binary [ nhs03 ]  4 was also fitted by a power - law of large energy slope @xmath22 , and x - ray binaries containing a black hole can present large @xmath22 in their soft state ( e.g. cyg x-1 ) .",
    "long term monitoring of these sources and a precise study of their actual counterparts are needed , in order to better constrain their nature .",
    "in this third paper on the x - ray emission from the ngc346 field , we have analyzed _ xmm - newton _  data taken six months before and after our _ chandra _ observations .",
    "51 sources were detected with _",
    "xmm - newton _ , 29 of them being in common with the _ chandra _ data analyzed in paper ii .",
    "a comparison of the x - ray observations of the field has revealed the variations of 21 of these 51 x - ray sources , 10 of them being known as x - ray binaries or xrb candidates .",
    "another varying source is hd5980 , which appears brighter during the first _ xmm - newton _  observation .",
    "however , the exact nature of these changes ( secular or phase - locked variations ? ) is not yet known , and requests additional x - ray data to be elucidated .",
