    "the study of hydrogen interaction with metals has gained an increased interest in the last decade  @xcite . the use of metal and semiconductor clusters as components of nanodevices , the development of cluster - based materials and the catalytic properties of clusters are the main reasons for the studies of interaction of atoms and molecules with clusters . understanding hydrogen interaction with clusters is important because of two basic reasons : first , there is a great interest in developing novel hydrogen absorbing nanomaterials for fuel cell applications , second , many of the organic materials and biological systems contain hydrogen which are involved important catalytic reactions .",
    "in particular , platinum is one of the most important ingredients in the heterogeneous catalysis of hydrogenation as well as in the catalysis of the co , no@xmath8 , and hydrocarbons .",
    "moreover , detailed investigations of the interaction between platinum clusters with hydrogen can contribute to the design of useful hydrogen storage devices .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to understand the interaction of one and two h atoms on platinum clusters .",
    "a brief summary of the previous theoretical and experimental studies on the pure platinum clusters can be found in our recent publications  @xcite .",
    "the following references can be added to them : grnbeck and andreoni  @xcite have presented a density functional theory ( dft ) study of au@xmath5-au@xmath6 and pt@xmath5-pt@xmath6 clusters in the neutral and anionic states .",

    "@xcite have reported the geometrical and electronic structure of the pt@xmath9 cluster in a dft study with a gaussian type basis set .",
    "one of the earliest _ ab initio _ studies on the pt - h@xmath5 reaction was published by the group of poulain  @xcite in 1986 .",

    "vibrational frequency calculations for each optimized structure has been carried out to differentiate local minima from transition states .",
    "the results are compared with previously studied pure platinum and hydrogenated platinum clusters .",
    "systematic growth in the atom number allows one to monitor the changes in the structure , dynamics , and electronic properties involved with the size of the clusters .",
    "this can provide an understanding of the nature of interaction between hydrogen and pt clusters .",
    "dft calculations have been performed by using version 4.7 of the nwchem program  @xcite .",
    "we have employed the lanl2dz  @xcite basis set for the pt atoms , which uses relativistic effective core potentials ( ecp ) to reduce the number of electrons explicitly considered in the calculation , and 6 - 311++g * * basis set for the h atoms .",
    "the ecp parameters for platinum and the basis set , as well as similar basis sets to the one employed in this study for the hydrogen have been successfully used in many previous studies  @xcite . to examine the effect of the choice of the exchange - correlation functional , we have calculated the properties of h and pt dimers and those of pth diatomic molecule by using different functionals : we have employed pw91pw91  @xcite and bpw91  @xcite functionals within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , svwn5  @xcite functional within the local density approximation ( lda ) , and b3lyp  @xcite and b98pw91  @xcite methods as hybrid functionals . at the end of the examination which is discussed in the next section ,",
    "we have chosen the bpw91 method to study pt@xmath0h@xmath1 clusters .",
    "the default nwchem geometry optimization convergence criteria were used in all cases .",
    "initial structures have been relaxed without imposing any symmetry constraints .",
    "the final structures therefore include possible jahn - teller distortions .",
    "whenever the optimized structure has had a symmetry other than @xmath10 , the relaxation process has been repeated with that symmetry constraints starting from the optimized geometry in order to get the electronic state .",
    "spin - polarized calculations have been done for the first two multiplicities of the clusters up to pt@xmath4h .",
    "thus , singlet and triplet states have been worked out for those having even number of electrons and doublet and quartet states have been worked out for those having odd number of electrons .",
    "in addition , we have also studied the quintet states of pt@xmath4h@xmath5 , pt@xmath6 and pt@xmath6h@xmath5 clusters , and sextet states of pt@xmath6h clusters .",

    "however , it has resulted in the worst bond length ( 2.47 @xmath12 ) for pt@xmath11 ( experimental value is 2.33 @xmath12 ) .",
    "therefore , it highly underestimates the be of pt dimer by calculating only a half of the experimental value .",
    "when a second hybrid functional b98pw91 is considered , it can be seen in table  [ table1 ] that although the results for pt@xmath11 are improved as compared to the results of the b3lyp method , it still overestimates the bond length and underestimates the be of the dimer significantly . on the other hand , the svwn5 lda method has produced very good results for the bond lengths of all of the three molecules . however , when the bes are taken into account , it is not favorable , too .",
    "it highly overestimates pt@xmath11 and pth bes .",
    "we have tried two gga methods for the properties of the three diatomic molecules : pw91pw91 and bpw91 .",
    "both of them have resulted in nearly the same bond lengths which are excellent for h@xmath11 and pth , and very good for pt@xmath11 .",

    "the error produced by the chosen method in the be of h molecule ( 9.5% ) is not very important in the present study since the h atoms in the pt@xmath0h@xmath1 clusters do not bind together as we discuss in the following sections . as a result",

    ". however , ( 4d ) is a triplet whereas ( 4e ) is a singlet . for the bridge - top configurations , the neighboring structure ( 4f ) is 0.1 ev more stable than the opposite structure ( 4 g ) .",
    "pt@xmath6h & pt@xmath6h@xmath5 : h can bind to the ground state pt pentamer on three different bridge and two different top sites .",
    "top site bonding is favorable in be : ( 5f ) is the lowest energy structure .",
    "however the homo - lumo gaps of the bridge site bonded structures are higher than those of top site bonded structures .",
    "all pt@xmath6h isomers in table  [ table3 ] are in the quartet states . for the bonding of 2h , we have identified three bridge - bridge , four bridge - top , and three top - top locally stable configurations . in each of these 10 optimization processes ,",
    "we have started from different h locations on the lowest energy structure ( 5 - 1 ) of the pt@xmath6 cluster . however , in three of them ( 5 - 1 ) configuration of the 5 pt atoms changed into some other topologies at the end of the relaxation : the ( 5i ) and ( 5p ) geometries are based on trigonal bipyramid and the ( 5o ) resembles to rhombus pyramid . in agreement with the general trend ,",
    "the most stable pt@xmath6h@xmath5 isomer is the ( 5p ) top - top structure with the highest be and the highest homo - lumo gap .",
    "the h - h distance in ( 5p ) is 1.91 @xmath12 and the 2h be is 5.59 ev .",
    "thus , the h absorbtion is still dissociative .",
    "while the ground state pt@xmath6h@xmath5 cluster ( 5p ) and three other isomers ( ( 5i ) , ( 5k ) , and ( 5 m ) ) are in quintet states , the other six isomers are in triplet states .",
    "similar to the previous clusters , generally bridge - top configurations have higher bes than bridge - bridge structures .",
    "figure  [ pth ] shows the plot of the be of one and two h atoms on the lowest energy isomers of the pt clusters .",
    "the h be is large for most clusters and in particular for clusters with 1 and 4 pt atoms .",
    "this is similar when 2h bes are considered .",
    "the clusters with 1 , and 4 pt atoms have larger bes for 2h compared to their neighboring sizes .",
    "we have further studied the stability of these clusters from the fragmentation channels in which a pt atom , or a pt@xmath5 , or pth molecule is one of the fragments .",
    "the fragmentation energies of all of these channels are listed in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "it is noted that the fragmentation energies are the largest for pt@xmath4h@xmath5 in pt and pth fragmentation channels .",
    "therefore , we expect it to be the most stable species . for the pt@xmath5 fragmentation , pt@xmath6h@xmath5 has the highest fragmentation energy . on the other hand , pt@xmath5h@xmath5 and",
    "pt@xmath7h@xmath5 have the lowest fragmentation energies for this channel .      in this section",
    "we discuss the change in the magnetic moment of the hydrogenated platinum clusters when successive h atoms are added to the bare pt clusters .",
    "the magnetic moments and the majority and minority spin lumo energies of the lowest energy structures for pt@xmath0h@xmath1 ( @xmath2 = 1 - 5 , @xmath3 = 0 - 2 ) clusters are presented in table  [ table5 ] .",
    "it can be seen in table  [ table5 ] that the successive h addition to pt atom and pt dimer reduces the magnetic moment as in the case of h absorption in bulk pt .",
    "however , when the successive h additions to the pt trimer and pentamer are considered , it is observed that as the magnetic moments decrease in the first additions , they increase in the second ones . for the tetramer",
    ", the magnetic moment increases in the first addition and decreases in the second .",
    "thus , the magnetic moments of certain small pt clusters exhibit an oscillatory change in the successive addition of h atoms .",
    "the results obtained in this study confirm the explanation of ashman et al .",
    "@xcite that this situation can be understood by looking at the lumo energy differences between the majority and minority spin electrons ( @xmath31 = minority spin lumo energy - majority spin lumo energy ) .",
    "when the minority spin lumo energy is much less than the majority spin lumo energy ( when @xmath31 is highly negative ) , the additional electron goes to the spin state with lowest lumo , and reduces the magnetic moment to decrease the cluster s total energy .",
    "this is what happens when successive h atoms are added to pt atom and dimer .",
    "however , if lumo of minority is slightly less than lumo of majority ( if @xmath31 is greater than a certain value which is around -0.227 ev for pt - h clusters ) , the additional electron may go to majority manifold since the exchange coupling could lead to a rearrangement of the manifolds .",
    "this explains the increases in the magnetic moments when h atoms are added to the pt@xmath7h and pt@xmath4 clusters .",
    "it should be noted here that nearly a half of the pt@xmath7h@xmath5 isomers in table  [ table3 ] are in the singlet , and the others are in the triplet states .",
    "similarly , one of the pt@xmath4h isomer is in the doublet and the other is in the quartet states .",
    "for pt@xmath6h , the @xmath31 is even positive and therefore we expect that h addition will most probably increase the magnetic moment .",
    "in fact , this expectation is confirmed in our results since the lowest energy isomer of the pt@xmath6h@xmath5 is found to be in the quintet state .",
    "in summary , we have presented results of studies on the interactions in the bare and hydrogenated platinum clusters .",
    "we find that h interacts strongly with pt clusters .",
    "the interaction of h@xmath5 molecule with any of the pt clusters studied in the present work is likely to be dissociative .",
    "h atoms can bond to pt clusters either on a bridge site or on a top site .",
    "we do not find any 3-fold bonding of h to pt clusters .",
    "in general , a top site bonding is more favorable than a bridge site bonding . therefore , for the bonding of two h atoms , top - top configurations are more stable than bridge - top and bridge - bridge configurations . among all the clusters we have investigated , we find that pt@xmath4h@xmath5 is the best candidate to be the most stable one",
    ". we do not agree with a previous claim that 3d geometries of pt tetramer and pentamer are unfavored .",
    "we have identified a distorted tetrahedron and a bridge site capped tetrahedron as the lowest energy structures of pt@xmath4 and pt@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "we have also shown that the successive addition of h atoms to pt clusters decreases the magnetic moments of the pt atom and pt dimer , whereas it leads to an oscillatory change in the magnetic moment of pt@xmath7 - pt@xmath6 clusters .",
