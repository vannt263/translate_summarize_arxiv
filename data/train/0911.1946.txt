    "observations of galaxy clusters have provided important clues about the formation and evolution of stars , galaxies and agn in these systems . and based upon the observed correlation between supermassive black hole mass and galaxy bulge mass , we expect that there should be numerous agn in the bright ellipticals in rich clusters as well .",
    "radio - loud agn have been directly implicated in cluster icm heating because evacuated `` bubbles '' in the diffuse x - ray emitting gas have been observed that are spatially coincident with non - thermal radio emission .",
    "but what about other non - bcg radio - loud galaxies ? is there a connection between cluster radio galaxies and the x - ray agn population ?",
    "what is the spatial distribution of this combined population ?    to answer these questions we present a multi - wavelength study of cluster agn that differs from many previous studies ( e.g. @xcite ) that use x - ray or radio observations , but not both , to detect agn in only one waveband .",
    "most cluster agn studies have either employed clusters in a flux - limited survey or simply selected clusters based upon availability .",
    "however , since most flux - limited surveys tend to detect the most luminous clusters at higher-@xmath7 , this selection naturally identifies more evolved structures at earlier times .",
    "this mismatch can result in comparisons which can obscure any true evolution , since more massive clusters are placed at the beginning of the evolutionary sequence and less massive objects at the end .",
    "we describe a unique cluster selection method below which avoids the difficulty just described and present a summary of our first results .",
    "guided by hydrodynamical simulations to track the growth of massive cluster halos ( @xmath8 ) from @xmath9 to the present epoch , we have used the temperature of the icm as a proxy for cluster mass and have selected eleven 0.2@xmath4z@xmath40.4 clusters that are predicted to evolve into objects like the present - day coma cluster ( kt=8.2@xmath100.2 kev ) .",
    "these 11 clusters are ms 0440.5 + 0204 , abell 963 , rx j0952.8 + 5153 , abell 2111 , ms 1455.0 + 2232 , abell 1758 , ms1008.1 - 1224 , ms2137.3 - 2353 , abell 1995 , ms1358.4 + 6245 , and abell 370 .",
    "our unique method attempts to select clusters of similar mass at a given redshift and thus these clusters on the `` road to coma '' will be used for consistent evolutionary comparisons later . at z@xmath110.3 , the icm temperature of a coma cluster progenitor",
    "is predicted to be 7.0@xmath102.6 kev where the temperature spread is due partly to the modest number of realizations of coma cluster mass - scale objects in these simulations .",
    "the details of the cosmological simulations ( similar to @xcite and includes preheating of the icm @xcite ) will be described in a future publication .",
    "we re - analyzed archival _ chandra _",
    "observations with adequate exposure times to detect xpss with l@xmath12@xmath510@xmath13 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "xpss were identified with the ciao program _",

    "we have augmented radio survey data ( e.g. , nvss , first ) with an analysis of new and archival vla 20 cm continuum images to detect radio galaxies with p@xmath17@xmath53@xmath1810@xmath19 w hz@xmath2 across the entire survey .",
    "this limit allows the detection of many lower radio power fr 1 sources while excluding the lower luminosity radio sources due to star formation ( p@xmath17@xmath410@xmath20 w hz@xmath2 , @xcite ) .",
    "two - color images and/or photometry are publicly available from sdss , cnoc @xcite , and/or _ champ _ @xcite .",
    "we obtained new optical images ( sloan _ g , r , i _ ) of one cluster at apache point observatory ( apo ) . for candidate cluster",
    "agn without published redshift and/or spectra , spectroscopic observations also were obtained for all objects with sloan @xmath21 using the apo 3.5 m with the double imaging spectrograph ( dis - ii ) , which provides complete spectral coverage from 37009000  .",
    "spectra for radio galaxies and xpss are complete to @xmath22@xmath4 - 20.8 ( m@xmath23 - 20.8 ) .",
    "we define passive galaxy spectra as those showing only stellar absorption lines ( e.g. , the 4000  ca break , mg ib , na i ) , while active galaxy spectra have detectable emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath24 , [ o  iii ] , etc . with [ o  iii]5007 @xmath5 h@xmath25 ) .",
    "we do not find any example of a starburst optical spectrum ( strong emission lines with [ o  iii]5007 @xmath0 h@xmath25 ) among either the radio galaxies or xpss .",

    "source d is several tenths of a magnitude bluer than the red sequence , but , nonetheless , possesses a passive absorption line spectrum .",
    "a composite x - ray spectrum of the 7 xpss ( not including source a ) can be fit with a power - law spectrum with @xmath31 with no evidence for intrinsic absorption and are are hosted by luminous red galaxies with no evidence for typical seyfert - like emission signatures .",
    "a cumulative radial distribution plot reveals that @xmath075% of our cluster radio galaxies and xpss are located within 500 kpc of the cluster center , compared to 40% of the crs galaxies within the same radius . a two - sided k - s test between the full x - ray @xmath32 radio population and the crs galaxy population as a whole are inconsistent with being drawn from the same parent population at @xmath5 99.999% confidence level ( k - s d - statistic = 0.36 and probability = 3.3@xmath1810@xmath33 ) . within 500 kpc 16 radio galaxies and 4 xpss",
    "make up 8@xmath102% of the bright ( @xmath34 265 ) crs galaxies .",
    "our result strongly suggests that the triggering of a radio - loud agn or an xps in these cluster galaxies is due to some , as yet undetermined , mechanism related to the icm density such as in the bondi accretion model of @xcite .",
    "additionally , these non - central cluster agn sources could provide a naturally distributed source of heating of the icm .    figure  [ fig : cmd_plot ] ( _ right _ ) displays l@xmath35 versus p@xmath17 for our cluster radio galaxies and xps , as well as for typical fr 1s @xcite ,  core \" ellipticals , and seyfert galaxies . with the exception of three sources our cluster radio galaxies and xpss rarely overlap with our luminosity limit . within our survey limits our cluster radio galaxies are consistent with the x - ray / radio luminosities of fr 1s .",
    "however , if our cluster xpss were also fr 1s , we would have detected them in our radio survey . the xpss appear to have x - ray luminosities and radio power limits consistent with seyferts , except that the xpss have no evidence for obscuration in the optical nor in x - rays",
    ". however , source d has an optical color that is @xmath36 0.5 mag bluer in ( g - r ) than its associated crs suggesting a possible power - law agn excess .",
    "we suggest that the properties of our cluster xpss are very similar to low luminosity bl lac objects of the class now called `` high - energy - peak '' bl lacs ( or hbls ) ( see @xcite ) .    within 500 kpc",
    "we use our detected number of cluster radio galaxies with p@xmath17@xmath53@xmath1810@xmath19 w hz@xmath2 and crs galaxies with l@xmath5l@xmath6 to extrapolate the rlf of radio galaxies to p@xmath17@xmath510@xmath37 w hz@xmath2 .",
    "we estimate that @xmath085% of all l > l * crs galaxies are radio - loud .",
    "similarly , using our cluster xps numbers , we extrapolate the xlf of hbls @xcite to l@xmath3810@xmath39 ergs s@xmath2 to find that all virtually all l@xmath5l@xmath6 crs galaxies host an xps .",
    "thus , we conclude that both the xpss and the radio sources are most readily identified as radio - loud agn with jets which can transfer heat into the surrounding icm ."

    "<S> our cluster radio sources have properties similar to fr1s , but are not detected in x - ray probably because their predicted x - ray emission falls below our sensitivity limits . </S>",
    "<S> based on the observational properties of our xps population , we suggest that the cluster xpss are low - luminosity bl lac objects , and thus are beamed low - power fr 1s . extrapolating the x - ray luminosity function of bl lacs and the radio luminosity function of fr 1s down to fainter radio and x - ray limits , we estimate that a large fraction , perhaps all crss with l@xmath5l@xmath6 possess relativistic jets which can inject energy into the icm , potentially solving the uniform heating problem in the central region of clusters .     </S>",
