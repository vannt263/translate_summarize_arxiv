    "nanoscale radiative heat transfer has attracted a lot of attention in the last few years because of polder and van hove s prediction  @xcite on the possibility to observe heat fluxes at subwavelength distances which are several orders of magnitude larger than those obtained by the blackbody theory .",
    "recent experimental results  @xcite have confirmed these theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "this increased radiative heat transfer in the near - field regime might be used for different applications as for example near - field imaging  @xcite , nanoscale thermal management by heat flux rectification , amplification and storage  @xcite , and near - field thermophotovoltaics  @xcite . in particular , for near - field thermophotovoltaic ( ntpv ) applications it is desirable to have large heat fluxes which are quasi - monochromatic at the bandgap frequency of the thermophotovoltaic cell .",
    "now , it could be shown theoretically that for phonon - polaritonic materials the heat flux is quasi - monochromatic at the surface phonon - frequency resulting in heat fluxes which can be orders of magnitude larger than the blackbody result  @xcite due to the large number of contributing surface modes  @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why phonon - polaritonic media are used in most experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that there are also upper limits for this surface mode contribution as shown in  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the nanoscale heat flux between two halfspaces separated by a distance @xmath0 which is due to surface modes is absorbed on a very thin layer of about @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "that means , that when constructing for example a near - field thermophotovoltaic device choosing @xmath2 most energy is already absorbed in a thin surface layer of about @xmath3 .",
    "this is very unfavorable for applications in near - field thermophotovoltaic devices , since only the electron - hole pairs in this thin layer can effectively be used for energy conversion  @xcite .    as could be shown recently  @xcite for so called hyperbolic or indefinite materials  @xcite , which exist naturally  @xcite but",
    "can also be constructed artificially by combining layers of a dielectric and a plasmonic / polaritonic material  @xcite or by using plasmonic / polaritonic nanowire structures  @xcite , the nanoscale heat radiation by hyperbolic modes can result in heat fluxes which are on the order of or even larger than the heat flux by surface modes  @xcite .",
    "this is due to a broad band of hyperbolic modes which are , in fact , frustrated total internal reflection modes .",
    "recently , hyperbolic structures were proposed for applications in ntpv  @xcite .    having a broad frequency band for nanoscale heat radiation seems to be disadvantageous for ntpv , but",
    "this disadvantage is compensated by a striking property of hyperbolic modes : hyperbolic modes are propagating modes inside the hyperbolic metamaterials and therefore it can be expected that the penetration depth is much larger than for surface modes . hence , the effective layer on which electron - hole pairs are generated can be orders of magnitude larger than for surface - mode driven heat transfer .",
    "this property could be shown by means of an effective description , presented very recently by us  @xcite .",
    "but such effective descriptions should be taken with care for describing near - field thermal radiation , since it tends to overestimate the hyperbolic contribution to the heat flux  @xcite and it does not correctly describe the surface modes of the composite materials of the hyperbolic structure  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the penetration depth of the energy flow in multilayer hyperbolic materials using an exact s - matrix method  @xcite based on the green s function  @xcite formalism combined with fluctuational electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "we have previously shown that the attenuation length can be very large for hyperbolic nanowire and multilayer materials using an effective medium description  @xcite . here",
    ", we use the exact formalism to study the energy flux and penetration depth for multilayer hyperbolic metamaterials .",
    "the exact formalism is compared with effective medium theory to better understand potential limitations of the latter .",
    "we emphasize that the here developed method can directly be used to make exact calculation for the energy streamlines inside hyperbolic multilayer structures which were treated only within the effective medium approach so far  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of near - field heat radiation is in most studies based on fluctuational electrodynamics  @xcite . within this theory",
    "it is assumed that the thermal fluctuating fields of a dielectric body which is assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath4 are on a macroscopic scale due to fluctuational source current densities .",
    "hence , maxwell s equations are augmented by fluctuational gaussian source currents @xmath5 and @xmath6 yielding @xmath7 for nonmagnetic materials the fluctuating magnetic source currents can be neglected @xmath8 .",
    "the source current density @xmath9 is assumed to have zero mean value @xmath10 , where the brackets symbolize the ensemble average",
    ". then it is further assumed that the second moment or correlation function of the source currents is given by the fluctuation dissipation theorem of second kind  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the imaginary part of the permittivity tensor of the considered material ; @xmath14 is the permittivity of vacuum , @xmath15 is planck s constant , @xmath16 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath17 is the circular frequency , and @xmath18 stands for the delta function . here",
    ", obviously quantum mechanics in form of the fluctuation dissipation theorem enters into the theoretical description which can therefore be regarded as a semi - classical theory .",
    "however , a full quantum mechanical description agrees with this method  @xcite .",
    "now , since the fields are linearly related to the sources they can be expressed as @xmath19 introducing the dyadic green s functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 . since we only consider nonmagnetic materials @xmath22 is the permeability of vacuum and of all materials . by means of the fluctuation dissipation theorem",
    "we can now derive the mean poynting vector or maxwell s stress tensor , for instance .",
    "for some general elaborations on the stress tensor and the poynting vector within the formalism of fluctuational electrodynamics we refer the interested reader to  @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in heat radiation we focus on the poynting vector .",
    "let us now assume that we have a situation as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : layeredmedium ] .",
    "for @xmath23 we have a semi - infinite isotropic material which is at local thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath24 .",
    "this halfspace is separated by a vacuum gap of size @xmath0 from a second halfspace which can be any kind of multilayer structure and which is assumed , for sake of clarity , to be at zero temperature .",
    "this assumption means that this medium does not emit thermal photons but it can only scatter and absorb them .",
    "however , of course , this medium could be set at any temperature .",
    "straight forwardly we obtain the expression ( using the einstein convention ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the antisymmetric levi - civita tensor and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) are the electric ( magnetic ) dyadic green s functions of the considered geometry with source points @xmath29 in the halfspace for @xmath30 and the observation point @xmath31 inside the vacuum gap or the second halfspace for @xmath32 .",
    "hence , when knowing the dyadic green s functions we can determine the poynting vector which describes the energy transfer by thermal emission at any position within the multilayer structure ( @xmath32 ) and for any separation distance @xmath0 .",

    "the amplitudes @xmath56 and @xmath57 are determined by the s - matrix method described in appendix  [ appendixsmatrix ] . in the same manner as detailed above , one can determine the heat flux from the medium at @xmath32 which is assumed to have a temperature @xmath58 . in this case",
    "we obtain the same result as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : poynting ] ) but with @xmath59 being replaced by @xmath60 .",
    "then the total heat flux is the sum of both contributions .",
    "let us assume that the temperature of the first halfspace ( @xmath30 ) is @xmath61 and that of the multilayer structure ( @xmath32 ) is @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "one can determine the heat transfer coefficient from  ( [ eq : poynting ] ) @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the spectral heat transfer coefficient .",
    "in this equation @xmath67 is the mean transmission coefficient of all modes at the frequency @xmath17 over the distance @xmath43 . the energy flux is then given by @xmath68 . by means of this expression",

    "the total attenuation length @xmath71 is similarly defined as the distance @xmath43inside the multilayer structure ( @xmath32 ) at which the heat transfer coefficient @xmath72 has dropped to @xmath73/e .",
    "it is clear from its definition that the asymptotic behavior of heat transfer coefficient at long distance is exponentially decaying .",
    "however as we are going to see in the next section , compared with bulk homogeneous materials , the attenuation length of heat flux can be significantly increased in particular layered structures .",
    "the formalism introduced above is general and it could be applied to describe heat transport by radiation through any arbitrary layered structures .",

    "to get some insight on the flux attenuation mechanism in hyperbolic media we examine below how a plane wave traveling along the @xmath43 direction is damped . since these hyperbolic modes are p polarized only , we focus on the damping of p polarized waves .     and @xmath89 and their phases @xmath90 and @xmath91 from eqs .",

    "we have shown for multilayer materials of finite size that the attenuation length inside the investigated hyperbolic structure is about one to two orders of magnitude larger than inside the bulk materials but it highly depends on the choice of the topmost layer material which can strongly screen the heat flux .",
