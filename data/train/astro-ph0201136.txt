    "the dark ages are ended by the appearance of the first stars and/or quasars , that reheat the diffuse cosmic baryons and then reionize the universe ( see rees 1999 ) .",
    "the reionization is defined as the epoch when the volume  filling factor of hii regions is @xmath1 , and the universe becomes transparent to ionizing radiation ( for an extensive review see loeb & barkana 2001 ) .",
    "the absence of a gunn  peterson ( gp ) effect in the line of sight of distant quasars , put the epoch of reionization ( @xmath2 ) at redshifts @xmath3 . to date , there are little additional constraints on the physics of the cosmic baryons at such high redshifts .",
    "this is also due to the complexities involved by any theoretical model that must include the nature and the birthrate of the first luminous objects , their spectrum and emissivity , their feedback into the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) , etc .",
    "a significant step forward has been recently obtained with keck spectroscopy of the most distant sloan quasars ( becker et al .",
    "2001 ; djorgovski et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the presence of a sudden increase in the ly@xmath4 opacity between redshift 5 and 6 may indicate that the universe is approaching reionization at @xmath5 . however , barkana ( 2001 ) pointed out that , due to the high ly@xmath4 opacity , these observations are also consistent with a post  reionization phase , and that a conclusive proof requires the observation of similar gp absorptions along several additional line of sights .",
    "alternatively , the observation of smoking  gun signatures has been proposed . among them : dectection of scattered ly@xmath4 emission around sources beyond @xmath2 ( loeb & rybicki 1999 ) ; features in galaxy number counts at @xmath6 ( barkana & loeb 2000 ) .",
    "these observations would be effective probes of the physics of cosmic baryons and of the nature of the first ionizing sources at the same time , but they must wait for ngst and/or sirtf , which will be operating at the end of this decade .",
    "signatures of the reionization are expected also in the cmb .",
    "map and planck can probe the optical thickness at @xmath2 in the 30150 ghz range .",
    "in particular , fluctuations on @xmath7 degree reflect the topology of reionization .",
    "however , such measures are highly degenerate with cosmological parameters .",
    "it is clear that the investigation of the universe at @xmath8 is a difficult task with present  day facilities . in this situation , the observational window offered by",
    "the redshifted 21 cm line can open much of the universe to a direct study of the reheating and reionization epochs . in the following",
    "we will discuss some observations of hi at high @xmath9 that can shed light on many aspects of these processes .",
    "in this section we outline a simple scenario for the thermal history of the diffuse cosmic baryons in the high@xmath9 universe , and we show under which condition they emit in the 21 cm line .    during the dark ages ( @xmath10 ) , most of the baryons of the universe are distributed uniformly .",
    "the typical density contrast on scales @xmath11 mpc is still in the linear regime .",
    "the temperature of the diffuse baryons , experiencing only adiabatic cooling since the decoupling from the cosmic background radiation , is about @xmath12 k ( couchman 1985 ) , which , at redshift @xmath8 , is one order of magnitude smaller than the cmb temperature @xmath13 .",
    "the spin temperature @xmath14 of the cosmic baryon is defined via the ratio of the population of the triplet and the singlet state of the spin transition originating the 21 cm emission . in absence of any coupling ,",
    "the spin of the igm is in thermal equilibrium with the background radiation , and @xmath15 on a very short timescale . to observe the 21 cm emission from hi against the cmb , we need some process that decouple @xmath14 from @xmath16 .",
    "collisions are ineffective , since the density contrast on mpc scales is too low ( madau , meiksin & rees 1997 ) .",
    "there is , however , an efficient mechanism that makes hi visible in the redshifted 21 cm line : the wouthuysen ",
    "field effect ( wt ) . in this process",
    ", a ly@xmath4 photon field mixes the hyperfine levels of hi in its ground state via intermediate transition to the @xmath17 state ( see appendix in tozzi et al .",
    "the process effectively couples @xmath14 to the color temperature @xmath18 of a given ly@xmath4 radiation field ( field 1958 ) .",
    "the color temperature is easily driven toward the kinetic temperature @xmath19 of the diffuse igm due to the large cross section for resonant scattering ( field 1959 ) .",
    "therefore the spin temperature can be written as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the ly@xmath4 pumping efficiency , and @xmath22 is the total rate at which ly@xmath4 photons are scattered by an hydrogen atom .",
    "thus , the diffuse igm at very high redshift ( between recombination and full reionization ) can be observed in the redshifted 21 cm radiation against the cosmic background in presence of a ly@xmath4 background ( likely produced by the same sources that reionize the universe ) . the expected emission is less than 10 mk ( shaver et al .",
    "1999 ; tozzi et al .",
    "however if @xmath23 , the hi is visible in absorption with a signal significantly larger than the maximum detectable in emission ( see hogan & rees 1979 ) .",
    "thus , the most favourable condition for detection is given by a cold igm in a strong ly@xmath4 field .",
    "at the same time , the ly@xmath4 photon field also reheats the diffuse gas , driving @xmath19 towards larger values .",
    "the thermal history of the diffuse igm results from the competition between adiabatic cooling and reheating due to the photon field , and it can be simply described as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the heating rate due to recoil of scattered ly@xmath4 photons and , possibly , to additional contribution from an x  ray background ( here @xmath26 ) .",
    "the heating is quite efficient , since only 0.004 ev per particle are needed to heat the igm above the cmb at @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , ly@xmath4 resonant scattering or photoelectric heating by soft x ",
    "ray photons can reheat the igm in 10% of the hubble time ( madau , meiksin & rees 1997 ) , and the wt mechanism leads preferentially to emission in the 21 cm line .",
    "the signal from high@xmath9 hi can be predicted by solving eq . 1 and eq .",
    "2 , after assuming a value for the ly@xmath4 radiation field .",
    "a reference value is the thermalization rate @xmath27 , which is the critical value that would drive @xmath14 towards @xmath19 , and , at the same time , would heat the baryons at a rate of about 200 k per gyr ( see madau , meiksin & rees 1997 ) .",
    "between @xmath28 the universe is expected to experience a phase transition from the neutral to the reionized phase . a first effect of the reionization is the sudden disappearance of the 21 cm emission from hi . in fact , shaver et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that with a bandwidth of 5 mhz , and an observation of 24 hours , the reionization signal ( figure 1 ) is detected at 100@xmath29 independent of telescope size .",
    "for this measure sensitivity is not an issue , the challenge concerns signal contamination .",
    "in fact , the sharpness of this feature , expected in the 70240 mhz range , makes it recognizable from galactic and extragalactic foregrounds ( di matteo et al .",
    "in addition , gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) computed the 21 cm emission in a specific @xmath30cdm cosmology within an n  body simulation , and showed that the fluctuations in the 21 cm emission will dominate the fluctuations in the cmb by two orders of magnitude ( figure 2 ) . the global , all ",
    "sky signature of the reionization , can be easily detected by present ",
    "day radio telescopes also in the case of a non - homogeneous , patchy process , as in the case of isolated , strong ionizing sources .",
    "another all  sky , distinctive signature is expected at lower fequencies .",
    "a narrow but deep absorption feature would appear in correspondence of the short but significant interval when the ly@xmath4 field reach the thermalization value while @xmath31 .",
    "the signal computed in the case of heating only by ly@xmath4 photons , is shown in figure 3 .",
    "such a strong absorption feature ( @xmath32 mk ) marks the transition from a cold and dark universe to a universe populated with radiation sources , but not yet reionized .",
    "the effect is weakly dependent on the reheating epoch and on the adopted cosmology . on the other hand",
    ", the amplitude of the signal will be strongly dependent on the timescale @xmath33 on which the ly@xmath4 field reaches the thermalization value . in any case",
    ", the maximum of the absorption is always larger than 10 mk ( see tozzi et al . 1999 ) .",
    "thus , the reheating and reionization epochs are expected to leave a double signature superimposed on the cmb in the 100200 mhz frequency range .",
    "the detailed appearance of such a feature will depend on the spectrum of the ionizing sources .",
    "a physical scenario , including a well defined population of sources , can be built with the code cuba ( f. haardt and p. madau , see http://pitto.mib.infn.it/  haardt / cosmology.html ) , which provide the evolution of the background radiation to be plugged into eq .",
    "a tomography of the igm at high @xmath9 can be obtained scanning this frequency range .",
    "apart from the all  sky , global signatures that are potentially detectable with a single  dish telescope , an array with a sensitivity of few @xmath34jy can detect also the fluctuations in the neutral baryons on scales @xmath35 , corresponding to few comoving mpc . in the linear regime",
    ", the fluctuations induced in the brightness temperature will be directly proportional to @xmath36 , allowing a straightforward reconstruction of the perturbation field at that epoch . in figure  4",
    "we show results for two cosmologies , a tilted critical cdm universe ( tcdm ) , and an open @xmath37 universe ( ocdm ) . in both cases the fluctuations are normalized to reproduce the local abundance of clusters of galaxies",
    ". in ocdm the fluctuations are larger by a factor of 3 since for a given local normalization at @xmath38 , the amplitude of the perturbations at high @xmath9 is correspondingly larger than that in tcdm . in both figures the density field has been evolved with a collisionless n  body simulation using the hydra code ( couchman , thomas , & pearce 1995 ) , where the baryons are assumed to trace the dark matter distribution without any biasing .",
    "if reheating is provided by a sparse distribution of quasars , 21 cm emission on mpc scales will be produced in the quasar neighborhood ( outside the hii bubble ) as the medium surrounding it is heated to @xmath39 by soft x - rays from the quasar itself .",
    "the emission region is followed by an absorption ring , since the ly@xmath4 photons reach regions where @xmath40 . the size and intensity of the detectable 21 cm region",
    "will depend on the quasar luminosity and age .",
    "the radio map resulting from a quasar ` sphere of influence ' , 10 myr after it turns on at @xmath41 ( tcdm ) is shown in figure 5 ( left ) .",
    "the absorption region is limited to a small edge .",
    "moreover , in figure 5 ( right ) , we show a quasar with the same ly@xmath4 luminosity but with a spectrum absorbed at energies larger than the lyman limit , as in the case with an intrinsic @xmath42 @xmath43 . consequently the hii region is reduced , and the x  ray warming front is well behind the light radius .",
    "this occurrence leads to a larger absorption ring where the signal reaches @xmath44 mk .",
    "in addition , imaging the gas surrounding a quasar in 21 cm emission could provide a direct means of measuring intrinsic properties of the source , like the emitted spectrum and the opening angle of quasar emission .",
    "the proposed observations are an obvious target for the square kilometer array ( ska , see http://www.ras.ucalgary.ca/ska/science/science.html ) .",
    "if @xmath45 of ska were reserved for a compact configuration ( @xmath46 km in diameter ) the igm fluctuations would be detectable at 150 mhz with 1 resolution and a bandwidth of 1 mhz , as also quasar emission / absorption shells . in figure 2 of tozzi",
    "et al . ( 2000 ) , we showed that a 5@xmath29 detection of fluctuations on scales larger than 2 can be reached with less than 100 hours of integration .",
    "a potential problem of this kind of observation is the extremely low frequencies involved . to explore the range @xmath47 , where the reheating phase is expected , we need good sensitivity and resolution down to 70 mhz and lower , where technical problems due to the structure of the ionosphere arise and a dedicated instrument",
    "is needed .",
    "this bandwidth will be observable with the low frequency array ( lofar ) .",
    "such observations will have greater probability of detecting the reheating epoch at high @xmath9 , taking advantage of the strong signal expected during the short epoch when the cold hi reaches its maximum optical depth against the cmb .",
    "as we said above , we do not rely only on future radio facilities .",
    "all  sky features or @xmath48 scale fluctuations ( corresponding to @xmath49 mk ) would be detectable with a small but dedicated telescope , with diameter of about 250 m. a near  future radio facility like the canadian large adaptive reflector ( clar , see s. cot , these proceedings ) would provide a 5@xmath29 detection in 300 hours of integration for a typical density fluctuation .",
    "the reionization is a crucial epoch in the evolution of cosmic structures . the same ingredients that characterize it ( for example : nature of the first sources , the role of black holes in galaxy formation , the role of feedback",
    ", the chemical enrichment of the igm ) will deeply affect the evolution of the universe in the following epochs . getting direct information about these crucial early stages of the luminous universe",
    "is an obvious goal for the next  decade cosmology . to date , several strategies have been proposed , but most of them must wait for the next generation of astronomical facilities .",
    "the observations of high@xmath9 hi in the redshifted 21 cm , on the other hand , offer the possibility to investigate the reionization epoch using future but also present ",
    "day radio facilities .",
    "all  sky signals from hi at redshift @xmath8 are recognizable as discontinuities superimposed on the cmb in the wavelength range @xmath50 mhz . in particular , the epoch of reheating can be seen as a deep ( @xmath51 mk ) absorption feature against the cmb , at the corresponding redshifted 21 cm line .",
    "the density perturbation field at a redshift @xmath52 can be reconstructed looking for mk fluctuations at @xmath53@xmath54 resolution in the radio sky .",
    "finally , luminous quasars can be seen by identifying peculiar , ring  shaped signals whose",
    "morphology depends on the source s age , luminosity and geometry .",
    "such observations represent an exciting scientific and technological challenge , and will constitute a unique investigation of the dark ages , for many aspects complementary to future observations at other wavelengths ."
