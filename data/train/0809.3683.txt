    "in his celebrated works  @xcite on the `` @xmath0 conjecture '' , mark haiman introduced several collections of bi - graded representations of symmetric groups whose dimensions are equal to numbers of parking functions , catalan numbers , higher catalan numbers etc .",

    "our proposition  [ gen - span ] below should be thought of as some version of the boson ",
    "fermion correspondence for operators which are slightly more complicated than the fermions .",
    "the main case of interest for our paper is a very degenerate case of a lattice equipped with a bilinear form whose kernel has codimension  @xmath32 .    in section  [ parking ] , we prove the results announced above . during the preparation of this paper",
    ", we learned that the monomial bases which appear as the key ingredient of our proof were introduced previously in a paper of roitman  @xcite .",
    "however , our proofs are essentially different : instead of using the machinery of rewriting and the diamond lemma , we use explicit representations or our algebras which help to get lower bounds on dimensions and characters ( thus making explicit a remark of dong quoted in  @xcite ) .",
