    "a full understanding of how stars form , both in the milky way and in other galaxies , requires an improved picture of the formation of massive stars . most of the stars in our galaxy form in regions of clustered star formation , and nearly all massive stars appear to form in dense clusters ( elmegreen 1985 , carpenter 2000 , lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "massive forming stars provide the only obvious signposts of star formation in distant regions of our galaxy and certainly in other galaxies .",
    "the star formation prescription most widely used in simulations of galaxy formation and evolution , the kennicutt - schmidt law ( schmidt 1959 , kennicutt 1998 ) is based on tracers like h@xmath12 ( e.g. , calzetti 2008 ) , which trace the formation only of relatively massive stars .",
    "the signs of formation of lower mass stars are mostly invisible at the distances of other galaxies .",
    "for all these reasons , a better understanding of the formation of massive stars is important .",
    "however , our knowledge of the massive star formation process is still limited , in both observational and theoretical aspects , in contrast to the progress made in the study of low - mass star formation .",
    "observational progress has been limited by distance , complexity , and the rapid evolution of young massive stars .",
    "most high - mass star - forming regions are very distant from us , normally at least an order of magnitude farther than the nearby low - mass star forming regions .",
    "when they are close enough to study in detail , such as the orion molecular cloud , we find an extremely complex environment marked by high turbulence , high density and opacity ( e.g. , o@xmath13dell 2005 ) , and multiple large - scale motions , including possible explosive events .",
    "the fast evolution of the new - born massive stars leads to a harsh radiative environment .",
    "together with the jets , winds , and outflows , the radiation field rapidly destroys the evidence that we need .",
    "the confusing observational picture allows quite a variety of theoretical models to exist .",
    "recently , the models have tended to fall into one of two camps .",
    "bonnell et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) and bonnell & bate ( 2005 ) have begun with a clump containing many jeans masses , which fragments rapidly into small stars that compete to accrete the remaining gas .",
    "the other camp , represented by mckee & tan ( 2002 , 2003 ) and tan , krumholz & mckee ( 2006 ) , argue that such a clump will be composed of a spectrum of turbulent cores , essentially scaled - up versions of the well - studied cores that form low - mass stars .",
    "the higher mass stars then form because turbulent pressure produces a much higher accretion rate . for an interesting discussion of these different approaches , see krumholz & bonnell ( 2007 ) .",
    "recent simulations including radiative feedback from forming protostars found that the extreme fragmentation found in earlier , isothermal simulations was greatly suppressed , allowing more massive stars to form ( krumholz et al . 2007 , urban et al . 2010 , krumholz et al . 2010 ) .",
    "in this situation , one positive step to study massive star formation is to make statistical studies based on systematic surveys towards a large and well - characterized sample of massive star - forming regions . using suitable tracers , which can reveal the physical and dynamical properties of the regions",
    ", we can provide the basic constraints that successful theories must satisfy .",
    "star formation is not uniformly distributed over molecular clouds , but is restricted to regions within molecular clouds where the density exceeds some threshold , roughly @xmath14 or @xmath15 @xmath16 ( e.g. , evans , 2008 ) .",
    "there have been many detailed studies of individual regions of massive star formation and surveys of likely regions in tracers of dense gas or dust ( e.g. , plume et al .",
    "1992 , 1997 ; zinchenko , mattila , & toriseva , 1995 ; anglada et al .",
    "1996 ; sridharan et al . 2002",
    "; beuther et al .",
    "2002 ; wu & evans 2003 ) .",
    "these surveys have mostly used signposts of massive star formation , such as masers , hii regions , or infrared sources with particular colors .",
    "less biased surveys , using infrared dark clouds or blind surveys for millimeter wavelength dust continuum , are beginning to become available ( e.g. , price et al .",
    "2001 , williams et al .",
    "2007 , schuller et al .",
    "2009 , aguirre et al .",
    "2009 , rosolowsky et al .",
    "these will demand follow - up studies , and the question arises of what can be learned from different tracers .",
    "this work will focus on a large sample of massive star forming regions that are in an early phase of star formation , as indicated originally by the association with water masers .",
    "we have in the past referred to these regions as  cores \" , but mckee and co - workers prefer to restrict the use of  core \" to a smaller region that will form a single or small star group , and they refer to regions that will form clusters as  clumps . \"",
    "the expectation is that star - forming clumps will contain multiple cores .",
    "we adopt the mckee terminology here and refer to these objects as clumps .",
    "we emphasize however , that their properties are very different from the objects usually going by this name . as described by williams et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , clumps are traced by extinction or c@xmath17o  peaks and have modest mean densities of @xmath18 .",
    "most may not be gravitationally bound .",
    "the clumps we are studying here are very dense ( @xmath19 , e.g. plume et al .",
    "1997 ) , on average 100 times denser than the  cores \" in low - mass star forming regions ( e.g. mueller et al .",
    "2002 ) . to keep this distinction in mind",
    ", we refer to them as  dense clumps . \"",
    "since most also have high masses , we often refer to them as  massive dense clumps . \"",
    "the sample has been well studied by multiple cs line surveys ( plume et al .",
    "1992 , 1997 ) .",
    "a subsample of these sources has been mapped in the cs 5 - 4 transition ( shirley et al .",
    "2003 ) and in 350 @xmath20 m dust continuum emission ( mueller et al . 2002 ) .",
    "based on the dust continuum data , a 1d model was constructed to determine the mass , bolometric luminosity , and density distribution of those massive dense clumps ; a power - law density distribution ( @xmath21 with @xmath22 ) was found to fit the data well ( mueller et al .",
    "the cs 5 - 4 maps have provided further constraints on the size and virial mass of the dense clumps ( shirley et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "while the maps of cs 5 - 4 emission and dust continuum emission provided valuable statistical data on sizes and masses , systematic studies of other commonly used tracers can provide a valuable comparison set for surveys in these tracers , both in distant regions of our galaxy and in other galaxies .",
    "in particular , hcn has been used much more widely in surveys of starburst galaxies , and we need a set of fiducial objects in order to understand those surveys .    additional molecular lines that can trace dense clumps , as well as their maps , are needed for this purpose .",
    "we selected the cs 7 - 6 , cs 2 - 1 , hcn 3 - 2 , and hcn 1 - 0 transitions for further mapping .",
    "cs 7 - 6 and cs 2 - 1 maps can constrain models of the clumps that have been studied with cs 5 - 4 at different excitation levels . hcn 3 - 2 is a possible indicator of infall in massive star forming regions ( wu & evans 2003 ) , and it may be able to constrain mass inflow rates needed in theories of massive star formation .",
    "recent work ( gao & solomon 2004a , b ) shows that the luminosity of hcn 1 - 0 has a tight and linear correlation with infrared luminosity , for both nearby normal galaxies and distant starburst galaxies , suggesting that star formation efficiency may be constant in these different systems when measured against tracers of the dense gas .",
    "we can directly test this @xmath23-l@xmath24 correlation in galactic dense clumps , by mapping hcn 1 - 0 towards massive dense clumps .",
    "our results , based on the data in this survey , did indeed suggest that the ratio of massive star formation to the massive dense gas is similar in galactic dense clumps as in starburst galaxies ( wu et al .",
    "that result suggests that hcn can be used to connect star formation on scales ranging from individual dense clumps in our galaxy to distant galaxies",
    ". then we may be able to apply our knowledge of galactic massive star formation obtained from cs and hcn studies to star formation in other galaxies .",
    "for all these purposes , and for building a complete dataset to constrain models of individual massive dense clumps , we have carried out mapping surveys using hcn 3 - 2 , 1 - 0 , cs 7 - 6 and 2 - 1 . in this paper",
    "we report the basic results of the survey .",
    "the sample in the survey is a subset of the larger sample of dense clumps associated with h@xmath25o masers that have been surveyed with several cs transitions ( plume et al .",

    ", we selected 14 iras sources from outflow surveys ( zhang et al .",

    "these clumps have various luminosities ; in this paper they are not included in our statistics of the properties of massive dense clumps .",
    "we mapped massive clumps in the hcn 3 - 2 , hcn 1 - 0 , cs 7 - 6 , and cs 2 - 1 transitions .",
    "because of observing constraints , maps of a particular transition are not available for all sources in our sample , but we have attempted to map as many sources as possible in all the tracers . in addition to mapping the clumps in the main transitions , we also observed the optically thin isotopes of hcn and cs ( h@xmath4cn 3 - 2 and c@xmath5s 5 - 4 ) at the center position of most of these massive clumps to constrain models and to study infall in massive clumps .",
    "observations were taken between 1996 to 2007 , with information presented in table [ information ] .",
    "maps of hcn 1 - 0 and cs 2 - 1 were made with the 14-m telescope of the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) . the 16-element focal plane array ( sequoia )",

    "this ratio is smaller than the usual @xmath47 isotopic abundance ratio , partly due to the large fraction of self - absorption features presented in hcn 3 - 2 lines .",

    "the peak temperatures of every component , the lsr velocity of the main component ( f=2 - 1 ) , the linewidth , and the integrated intensity are presented in table [ hcn10table ] .",
    "massive clumps usually have large linewidths ; sometimes the line width is wider than the separation of hyperfine components , so that two or three of these components will overlap .",
    "sometimes one or two hyperfine components are optically thick enough to show absorption .",

    "the observed ratios for most of our clumps ( table [ hcn10table ] ) do not agree with these optically thin ratios , as expected for lines that are almost surely optically thick .",

    "2002 ) .",
    "considering only sources with maps of multiple lines of the same species , there are 37 dense clumps mapped in both hcn 1 - 0 and hcn 3 - 2 ; 6 clumps that are single clumps in hcn 1 - 0 maps break into multiple clumps in hcn 3 - 2 . among the 38 clumps mapped by both cs 2 - 1 and cs 5 - 4 ,",
    "4 single clumps in cs 2 - 1 maps show multiple components in cs 5 - 4 maps",
    ". this effect may be due to the higher resolution of the hcn 3 - 2 and cs 5 - 4 observations .",
    "for the 4 clumps that have been resolved by cs 5 - 4 but not cs 2 - 1 maps , they are either not observed by cs 7 - 6 , or the other components are beyond the cs 7 - 6 mapping area .",
    "consequently , we do not know if they are also separate peaks in the cs 7 - 6 maps .",
    "the overall impression is that low excitation lines may show secondary peaks that are not dense enough to show up in the lines requiring higher excitation , while maps with higher resolution may find multiple peaks within the low - resolution map .",
    "because lines of higher excitation in our study have better spatial resolution , those multiple peaks may not be seen in the lower excitation tracers , just because of instrumental limitations . to check this possibility ,",
    "we have smoothed the hcn 3 - 2 maps for four clumps with multiple peaks to the resolution of the hcn 1 - 0 data and compare them to the hcn 1 - 0 data ( figure [ compare12 ] ) .",
    "the similarity of the smoothed hcn 3 - 2 maps to the hcn 1 - 0 maps supports the suggestion that hcn 1 - 0 maps with higher resolution would also resolve multiple peaks .",
    "these few clumps aside , the general appearance of most maps at the current resolution is not one of many cores within a clump , but of single well - peaked distributions",
    ". maps with higher resolution that still retain sensitivity to extended structure are needed to study substructure in these clumps .",
    "the size of the clump is characterized by the angular diameter or linear radius after beam deconvolution .",
    "@xmath50 is the angular diameter of a circle that has the same area as the half peak intensity contour : @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the area within the contour of half peak intensity , @xmath54 is the fwhm beam size , and @xmath55 is the distance to the source .",
    "it is important to note that these sizes do not represent sharp boundaries . to show this fact , we chose g10.6 - 0.4 , w3(oh ) and s231 as examples , since these sources are round in the contour maps , thus better approximated by a 1d radial profile . in figure",
    "[ rprofile ] , the emission generally declines smoothly to the noise level , when plotted against the angular source size , in units of the fwhm angular extent .",
    "the calculated sizes of clumps in each transition are listed in table [ sizetable ] , with the mean and median values given at the end of the table .",
    "the statistics on median and mean value include only the massive sources , but not those sources below the horizontal line in the tables , which are mostly not very massive and were added to study the lower luminosity end of the star formation law .",
    "the histogram of the deconvolved fwhm sizes ( angular size and linear size ) of each transition are presented in figures [ anguhis ] to [ linhis ] , in which again we only include massive dense clumps above the horizontal line in the tables .",
    "figure [ anguhis ] shows the histogram of deconvolved angular fwhm size of these dense clumps , with a dashed line indicating the beam size in that transition .",
    "in hcn 3 - 2 maps , 29% of dense clumps have their deconvolved fwhm sizes smaller than the beam size . for cs 7 - 6 maps ,",
    "this ratio increases to 55% , including one source ( g12.21 - 0.10 ) not being resolved at all .",
    "the beam size effect can be nearly ignored for lower - j transitions ; almost all the fwhm sizes of hcn 1 - 0 and cs 2 - 1 are well above their beam sizes",
    ".    as figure [ linhis ] makes particularly clear , the size distribution is skewed to low values before it is cut off by our resolution limits .",
    "note that the plots of the lower excitation lines use a larger scale because they cover a substantially larger range of sizes .      for later comparison to work on other galaxies ,",
    "we compute the line luminosities and the infrared luminosities in the same way as is done for extragalactic studies .",
    "the line luminosity of each core , assuming a gaussian brightness distribution for the source and a gaussian beam , is ( we use hcn 1 - 0 for example ) @xmath56 here d is the distance in kpc , and @xmath57 and @xmath54 are the angular size of the half - peak hcn 1 - 0 contour and the beam in arcsecond .",
    "this method is analogous to that of gao & solomon ( 2004b ) , but adapted to galactic clumps .    the total infrared luminosity ( 8 - 1000 @xmath20 m )",
    "was calculated based on the 4 iras bands ( sanders and mirabel 1996 ) , as was done for the galaxy sample of gao & solomon ( 2004a ) : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the flux in band @xmath60 from the four iras bands in units of jy , d is in kpc , and l@xmath24 is in l@xmath27 .",
    "some authors used the bolometric luminosity ( l@xmath61 ) , which is calculated from the sed of the source ( e.g. mueller et al .",
    "our statistics show that l@xmath61 calculated in mueller et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is very close to the l@xmath24 calculated in this paper for the same clumps .",
    "the ratio of l@xmath24 to l@xmath61 is 1.28 @xmath460.90 , and the median is 1.09 .",
    "the relatively large dispersion for this ratio is strongly affected by two sources ( s252a and cepa ) whose ratio is much larger than others .",
    "excluding these two sources , the mean ratio becomes 1.10@xmath460.25 , with the median 1.08 .",
    "the mean and median values of  are ( @xmath62)5  and 1.065 , with values ranging from 708  to 56 , considering only the sources in the original sample .",
    "the infrared and line luminosities are tabulated in table [ lumtable ] , with mean and median values for the massive , dense clumps at the bottom .",
    "the histograms of luminosity are shown in figure [ lumhis ] . while the histograms appear to be well - peaked , we are systematically biased against low luminosity sources . together with the fact that the histograms plot the logarithm of the luminosity , the highest luminosity sources are clearly rare .",
    "for example , the mean value of luminosity is typically 3 times the median .",
    "although all these lines trace  dense \" gas , there are differences .",
    "higher j transitions of a given species trace denser parts of the core . crudely speaking , for a given j level , hcn transitions have higher critical densities than do the corresponding transitions in cs .",
    "the dependence on temperature also differs , with the upper level of the cs 7 - 6 transition lying 66 k above ground , compared to only 26 k above ground for the hcn 3 - 2 transition .    in table",
    "[ ratiotable ] , we list the properties of the transitions and the statistics of the size ratios and luminosity ratios of maps derived from different tracers .",
    "table [ property ] shows that maps of low - j transitions have larger deconvolved sizes than those of higher j transitions .",
    "for instance , the linear size of the hcn 3 - 2 map is 0.28 of the size of the hcn 1 - 0 maps , and the ratio is the same for cs 7 - 6 versus cs 2 - 1 .",
    "this result would not be found in a  raisin - pudding \" model of clumps : a roughly uniform pudding ( the clump ) with multiple dense cores sprinkled randomly throughout .",
    "that model would predict similar sizes for maps of transitions sensitive to different density regimes .",
    "such a pattern was seen in early studies of multiple transitions in a small number of sources ( snell et al .",
    "1984 , mundy et al . 1986 , 1987 ) .",
    "the current results have higher spatial resolution and more complete maps in the high - excitation lines than the early results and do show that higher excitation lines are more centrally condensed .",
    "if the clumps are centrally condensed , with either a smooth increase in density with decreasing radius , or an increased fraction of the volume filled by dense  raisins \" , the differences in size would be predicted as the lines from higher - j transitions would be strongly enhanced in the denser regions .",
    "detailed models of individual dense clumps do support density gradients with power laws providing good fits ( @xmath21 with @xmath22 ) ( mueller et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the linewidth at the peak of the dense clumps for different tracers shows an interesting trend .",
    "as presented in table [ fwhm ] , the mean and median fwhm linewidth of the dense clumps increase for higher j transitions , from about 4.8  for cs 2 - 1 , to about 5.9  for cs 7 - 6 . if we look at a optically thin tracer , like c@xmath5s 5 - 4 , the mean fwhm is 4.7 , which is closer to that of the cs 2 - 1 than higher j cs transitions",
    ".    studies of molecular clouds have established a positive correlation of cloud size , as mapped with a single tracer , and linewidth of that tracer ( larson 1981 , myers 1985 ) , which can be interpreted in terms of the virial theorem .",
    "the linewidth - size relation within individual cores or clumps is much less well - established ( e.g. , evans 1999 ) .",
    "here we refer to the useful distinction introduced by goodman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) between 4 different kinds of relationships .",
    "a goodman type-4 relation plots linewidths of a single tracer measured over regions of increasing radius ; such plots show little correlation ( goodman et al .",
    "1998 , barranco & goodman 1998 ) .",
    "goodman type-1 relations plot sizes measured in multiple tracers for multiple cores or clumps . such plots generally show positive correlations when using tracers of modest density applied to low - mass and intermediate - mass cores or clumps ; for example caselli & myers ( 1995 ) found @xmath63 with a correlation coefficient of 0.81 using , cs 2 - 1 , and c@xmath17o  1 - 0 maps of 8 starless cores .",
    "in contrast , studies of the cores in this sample with goodman type-2 relations ( single tracer , multicore ) have shown no correlation between linewidth and size ( plume et al .",
    "1997 for cs 7 - 6 ) or a weak ( r = 0.43 ) correlation ( shirley et al .",
    "2003 for c@xmath5s 5 - 4 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the linewidths were 4 to 5 times larger than would be predicted from the usual linewidth - size relations developed from studies of clouds and low mass cores . with maps of multiple tracers toward many cores",
    ", we could construct goodman type 3 relations ( multitracer , single core ) for each core .",
    "instead , we try a modified version ( type 5 ? ) in which we use the mean value over many cores for each transition .",
    "figure [ sizedv ] shows the mean linewidth versus the mean size of the dense clumps for cs 2 - 1 , cs 5 - 4 , cs 7 - 6 and hcn 1 - 0 transitions .",
    "hcn 3 - 2 lines have serious self - absorption , therefore they are excluded from this figure .",
    "hcn 1 - 0 has 3 hyperfine components ; we took the mean linewidth of the strongest component ( f=2 - 1 ) for the plot .",
    "the mean linewidth of the tracer has an _ inverse _ correlation with the mean size of the dense clumps .",
    "for example , while the cs 2 - 1 sizes are on average 4 times larger than those of cs 7 - 6 , the mean of the linewidth ratio of cs 7 - 6 to cs 2 - 1 is 1.18@xmath460.34 for the massive dense clumps ; the median ratio is 1.16 .",
    "the cs 2 - 1 emission traces a larger , quieter area than higher j transitions , while cs 5 - 4 and cs 7 - 6 trace more compact and apparently more turbulent regions .",
    "alternatively , the larger linewidths toward the center could in part reflect higher inflow motions .",
    "a similar trend was seen in observations and models of g10.6 ( keto 1990 ) .",
    "it is also possible that the turbulence ( here refers to all unresolved gas motions , including inflow , outflow , complex fluid motions ... ) has radial structure , which is higher close to the forming protostars and therefore is being picked up better by the higher - j , dense gas tracers .",
    "the usual size - linewidth relations certainly do not apply to these regions where massive stars are forming .",
    "while we speak of a transition as  tracing \" gas of a certain density , this formulation is too simplistic ; the emission from a transition increases smoothly and strongly over a wide range of densities and then levels out just above the critical density .",
    "[ this description applies only to lines with frequencies high enough that radiative transitions stimulated by cosmic background radiation or continuum emission from dust are unimportant ( evans 1989 ) . ] nonetheless , it is common to speak of a transition as tracing its critical density .",
    "if anything , the opposite is true , as transitions fail to provide useful probes of density _ above _ their critical density .",
    "a more sensible fiducial density is the effective density ( evans 1999 ) , which is the density needed to produce a line with a radiation temperature of 1 k for typical conditions . for these comparisons",
    ", we use the critical and effective densities calculated for a kinetic temperature of 100 k ( evans 1999 ) .",
    "both these measures are given in table [ property ] .",
    "the critical densities ( n@xmath64 ) of the hcn 1 - 0 and cs 2 - 1 lines differ by an order of magnitude , but their effective densities ( n@xmath65 ) , are very similar .",
    "the similarity of their mean sizes indicates that n@xmath65 better reflects the excitation requirements .",
    "for hcn 3 - 2 , cs 5 - 4 , and cs 7 - 6 , their sizes are also similar while the critical and effective densities make opposite predictions ; cs 7 - 6 has a much higher n@xmath65 than the other two , but hcn 3 - 2 has the highest n@xmath64 .",
    "the excitation energy of the upper level ( e@xmath66 ) is considerably higher for the cs 7 - 6 transition . if we consider only the sources that have been mapped by all three high - j transitions cs 7 - 6 , cs 5 - 4 , and hcn 3 - 2 ( column 5 and 7 in table [ property ] ) , statistics show that the mean size and luminosity of the dense clumps increase with decreasing @xmath67 of the transitions , as well as decreasing n@xmath65 , while the correlation with n@xmath64 is weaker .",
    "the tracers that need higher excitation energy or density are confined to smaller regions in the dense clumps , consistent with centrally condensed structures .",
    "in addition , n@xmath65 better reflects the excitation requirement than n@xmath64 .    empirically , we find that the hcn 1 - 0 and cs 2 - 1 lines form a matched set , while hcn 3 - 2 and cs 5 - 4 lines make another pair ; each pair has very similar sizes and fairly similar luminosities in the mean .",
    "the cs 7 - 6 lines are close to the properties of hcn 3 - 2 and cs 5 - 4 pair , but still more compact in size .      the virial mass of the dense clumps with power - law density distributions ( @xmath21 )",
    "is calculated by @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the correction for a power - law density distribution and @xmath71 is the correction for a nonspherical shape ( bertoldi & mckee 1992 ) . for aspect ratios less than 2 , @xmath72 and can be ignored for our sample . to calculate @xmath70",

    "the virial masses calculated from each transition ( @xmath74 ) , for hcn 1 - 0 , 3 - 2 , cs 7 - 6 , and 2 - 1 , are tabulated in table [ virialtable ] . rather than using the linewidth of the tracer",
    ", we used the linewidth of c@xmath5s 5 - 4 for all these tracers because it is more reliably optically thin than is the 3 - 2 line of h@xmath4cn .",
    "for lower mass sources ( those below the horizontal line in table [ virialtable ] ) , their c@xmath5s 5 - 4 lines are too weak to detect or to give a gaussian fit except for iras20188 + 3928 .",
    "the fwhm linewidth of cs 2 - 1 is closest to that of c@xmath5s 5 - 4 in our sample , with a ratio of linewidth for cs 2 - 1 to c@xmath5s 5 - 4 of 1.2@xmath460.1 and a median of 1.1 .",
    "so , for these lower mass clumps , we used the cs 2 - 1 linewidth to calculate their virial mass , and assigned an additional 20% uncertainty to their linewidth uncertainties . while the linewidths vary among transitions by about 25% , some of this variation must be caused by optical depth differences , and the differences in any case , are small .",
    "the sense of these calculations is then an estimate of the mass within the fwhm contour of each tracer .",
    "the mean ratio of @xmath75 for cs 2 - 1 to cs7 - 6 is 4.0 , with a median of 3.7 ; the mean ratio for hcn 1 - 0 and 3 - 2 is 2.9 , with a median of 2.8 .",
    "one would expect these ratios to reflect the size ratios , which are 4.1 and 3.0 ( the mean ratio ) , respectively .",
    "the virial mass enclosed by the fwhm contour of dense gas tracers represents the mass , most of which is dense gas , that is available to clustered star formation .",
    "therefore , one should expect a positive correlation between the star formation rate , as indicated by the infrared luminosity , and the virial mass .",
    "one caveat is that the star formation rate can be underestimated by l@xmath24 until the initial mass function is well sampled by the star formation process ( krumholz & thompson 2007 ) .",
    "we plot  versus l@xmath24 for four transitions in figure [ mvirlir4 ] .",
    "it is obvious that the infrared luminosity is positively correlated with the virial mass for these clumps .",
    "we used linear fits based on least squares minimization and alternatively on robust estimation , in which the absolute value of the deviation is minimized . comparing these two fits",
    "usually provides a more realistic appraisal of the true uncertainties .",

    "( 2005 ) , there is a cut - off around l@xmath76 in the l@xmath24-@xmath11 correlation .",
    "if we fit only the data for massive dense clumps with @xmath77 , the fitting results are as follows ( r is the correlation coefficient ) :    hcn 1 - 0 : @xmath78 @xmath79 hcn 3 - 2 : @xmath80 @xmath81 cs 2 - 1 : @xmath82 @xmath83 cs 7 - 6 : @xmath84 @xmath85    there are substantial variations between fitting method employed and among the line used .",
    "if we average the two fitting methods for each line and then average over all lines , the resulting slope is @xmath86 .",

    "gao & solomon ( 2004a ) and wu et al .",

    "the fact that massive dense clumps in our galaxy lie on the same relationship seen for starburst galaxies indicates that starburst galaxies can be understood as large collections of dense clumps , such as we observe in our galaxy . for a worked example of this idea , see wu et al .",

    "krumholz & thompson ( 2007 ) and narayanan et al . (",

    "they predict that values of @xmath12 will decline as higher excitation lines are used because @xmath154 is larger for subthermal lines . while narayanan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) are somewhat vague about the definition of @xmath155 , it is generally discussed in terms of mean density along the line of sight , hence proportional to surface density .",
    "the current surveys allow us to examine the correlations for dense clumps in our galaxy for five different tracers of dense gas . for tracers with sufficient data on other galaxies",

    "the least squares method yields slight superlinear relations , with values around 1.25 , except for cs 7 - 6 .",
    "more cs 7 - 6 maps on the lower luminosity may help to clarify which fit is better .",
    "more importantly , these correlations are by far the strongest we have plotted so far , confirming that  is an excellent tracer of  for the dense gas .    in table [ ratiomvdl ] we give the statistics on the ratios of logarithms of the virial mass to line luminosity for each tracer .",
    "the scatter is about a factor of 3 .",
    "all these lines provide good tracers for the mass of dense gas , as required for the gao & solomon interpretation .",
    "that statement is true even though these tracers are optically thick .",
    "the explanation is probably similar to explanations given for the fact that co traces the mass of lower density material .",
    "because co is thermalized at densities above about 1000 it is not sensitive to the dense gas that we are studying with these tracers .",
    "questions have been raised about the ability of hcn and cs to trace the mass because they require high densities to excite ( krumholz & thompson 2007 , narayanan et al .",
    "2008 ) . in our view ,",
    "that is exactly their virtue : they trace only the dense gas , which co can fail to trace .",
    "the density of the material they are tracing depends on their sensitivity to density and temperature , as discussed above .",
    "what is clear is that they trace the regions where clusters of stars , including massive stars , are forming and are thus most relevant to estimating the mass of gas that is immediately relevant for star formation .",
    "the good correlation between  and  stands in sharp contrast to the lack of correlation between surface density ( a good tracer for the mean density of the clump ) and  ( figures [ lhcn32sigma4 ] to [ lcs21sigma4 ] ) .",
    "the spread in  for a given surface density is about three orders of magnitude .",
    "we see no evidence in the data for the relation between  and mean density posited by narayanan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "the next question is whether the relations between  and seen in other galaxies ( gao & solomon 2004a ) extend down to the scale of individual clumps in our galaxy .",
    "the initial results of our survey of hcn 1 - 0 indicated that they did , except that there is a threshold , below which there is not enough dense gas to sample the imf .",
    "because  is dominated by massive stars , it can trace the star formation rate in the same way as galaxies , only with a reasonable sampling of the imf . even then",
    ", it will be subject to large statistical fluctuations from clump to clump , and it may underestimate the star formation rate because it takes some time for massive stars to form ( krumholz & thompson 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , we must expect substantial scatter in this relationship .    with these caveats in mind ,",
    "we can ask two questions . does",
    "correlate with ?",
    "does the relation steepen for tracers with higher critical density , as predicted by narayanan et al .",
    "we now consider these questions for the four tracers in this survey , as well as cs 5 - 4 mapping survey from shirley et al .",
    "in figure [ lirlmol5 ] we plot  versus  for hcn 1 - 0 , hcn 3 - 2 , cs 2 - 1 , cs 5 - 4 and cs 7 - 6 .",
    "figure [ lirratio5 ] shows the correlation between the distance independent ratio / , an indicator of star formation efficiency , and for different tracers .",
    "extragalactic data are lacking for the cs transitions , so we show the extragalactic data only for the hcn transitions .",
    "it is important to note that  is the same for each tracer , as it is a property of the entire clump and is measured from emission in large beams ( e.g. , iras ) or by integrating over maps at submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "this point has been missed by some analysts .",
    "first we consider the plots using @xmath169 as the dense gas tracer ..",
    "the correlation between  and @xmath169 found in the galaxies extends to the scale of dense clumps in our galaxy , as originally found by wu et al .",
    "there is a threshold , or equivalently , , which is most easily seen in figure [ lirratio5 ] . for @xmath77 ,",
    "all dense gas tracers show a nearly linear correlation with . above the threshold ,",
    "a linear least squares fit with uncertainties in both axes gives @xmath170 and a robust fit gives @xmath171 the fit to this relation in other galaxies is shown on figure [ lirlmol5 ] ; it is remarkably similar to that for massive , dense clumps in our galaxy .",
    "data for other lines in galaxies are scarce .",
    "the other panels on figure [ lirlmol5 ] and [ lirratio5 ] show the relations for the clumps in this study , along with the fit for the hcn 1 - 0 line in other galaxies .",
    "all show correlations with  above the threshold , we give here ( in order of increasing @xmath172 ) the linear least squares fit with uncertainties in both axes , and the robust fit for other dense gas tracers for cores with @xmath77 .",
    "cs 2 - 1 : @xmath173 @xmath174    cs 5 - 4 : @xmath175 @xmath176    cs 7 - 6 : @xmath177 @xmath178    hcn 3 - 2 : @xmath179 @xmath180    all the relations are close to linear .",
    "there is some tendency for the tracers with higher @xmath172 to have slopes less than unity , as predicted by narayanan et al .",
    "however they predict a slope of about 0.7 ( ranges from 0.63@xmath390.73 from their fig.7 ) for hcn 3 - 2 whereas we see @xmath181 .",
    "they do not predict values for cs transitions .",
    "the ratio of  to  depends on the tracer .",
    "the constant term in the fit increases steadily as a function of excitation requirements . as discussed in  4.1 ,",
    "the luminosity of the higher j tracers is less for a given clump because of their higher requirements for both density and temperature .",
    "it is then natural that the relation depends on the tracer used .",
    "the dependence on critical density ( or more generally on excitation requirements ) is primarily in this constant term ( which increases by an order of magnitude from cs 2 - 1 to cs 7 - 6 ) rather than in the slope in the log - log plot .      in order to explain the threshold and the linear correlation over a large range of scales , we have proposed a model of clustered star formation ( wu et al .",
    "we suggested that there is a basic unit of clustered formation . for @xmath182 less than the mass of this unit",
    ", @xmath183 rises rapidly with @xmath182 , as higher mass stars can form , and stellar luminosity rises rapidly with stellar mass . for @xmath182",
    "greater than the mass of this unit , the imf is reasonably sampled and further increases in mass produce more units , but no further change in @xmath183 . if we suppose that larger scale cluster formation is built up by adding more and more such units , then the linear correlation between the total @xmath10 and @xmath182 is a natural result , since @xmath23 traces @xmath182 . in that case",
    ", the only difference between star formation on different scales and in different environments from molecular clouds in our galaxy to massive starbursts is just how many such units they contain . table [ statishm ] and table [ statisgt45 ] contain the statistics of infrared luminosity , virial mass , and l@xmath24/m@xmath184 of all the massive dense clumps , and of the sample of massive dense clumps with @xmath185  only , respectively .",
    "the advantage of this model is that it can easily explain not only the linear correlation , but also the luminosity threshold : above a luminosity of about 5  , the imf is reasonably well sampled , and the dependence of stellar luminosity on stellar mass is less steep .",
    "the luminosity threshold is set by the requirement to sample the imf .",
    "a threshold of @xmath185  is consistent with a value ( @xmath186 ) that dominates the luminosity function of the uchii regions in the milky way ( cassassus et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this model can explain the fact that starburst galaxies have a very high star formation rate , but a similar star formation efficiency with respect to the dense gas as individual massive dense clumps in the milky way .",
    "extreme starbursts in galaxies happen when entire molecular clouds become filled with dense gas , likely due to the huge pressure in the extreme environments .    to summarize , the model proposed by wu et al .",
    "( 2005 ) starts with what we know about well - studied regions of star formation in our galaxy and tries to extend that picture to other galaxies .",
    "the alternative models assume that star formation laws derived from extragalactic studies covering large scales can be extended to the scales where stars actually form .",
    "for example , krumholz & thompson ( 2007 ) assumed that a schmidt law in the form involving volume density describes star formation : @xmath187 over the full range of densities .",
    "they further assumed that the distribution of densities in a molecular cloud follows a lognormal probability distribution .",
    "they argued that a molecular tracer essentially measures the mass of gas with density equal to or greater than the critical density for that transition . with a simple model of radiative transfer to correct the critical density for trapping",
    ", they showed that these assumptions led to a linear relation between star formation rate and line luminosity of a transition when the mean density of the galaxy was less than the critical density of the transition , as seen for hcn 1 - 0 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the mean density of the gas ( ) is greater than the critical density of the tracer , then the @xmath188 correlation will be super - linear , as is the case for co. narayanan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) add to this picture the idea that index is flattened by the increasing index ( @xmath154 ) in the relation between  and density .",
    "the average density determined from cs excitation of the massive clumps in our sample is about @xmath189  ( plume et al .",
    "1997 ) , less than the critical density of all the tracers in this study except for the cs 2 - 1 line ( table [ property ] ) , but greater than the effective density ( table [ property ] ) and the density that was found to contribute most to the hcn 1 - 0 line in the simulations of krumholz and thompson ( 2007 ) .",
    "in fact , a density derived from excitation analysis is biased towards the densest regions and the mean density of the clumps in the sense of mass divided by volume is generally less ( e.g. , shirley et al .",
    "as noted above , the relations we find do not support the suggestions by krumholz & thompson ( 2007 ) or narayanan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "another problem with the krumholz - thompson argument is that there is no evidence in our galaxy that the star formation density depends on the local gas density in the way assumed for a schmidt law .",
    "rather , there is a threshold density below which there is essentially no star formation . above that density , clumps and cores do not have lognormal distributions , but instead have centrally condensed power law distributions ( mueller et al .",
    "2002 , shirley et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "more detailed discussion about the origin of the @xmath188 correlation is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "more discussion can be found in recent reviews and papers ( e.g. , shirley et al .",
    "2008 ; narayanan et al . 2008 ; evans 2008 ; baan et al . 2008",
    "; inno et al . 2009",
    "; juneau et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the beam sizes used to map the lower excitation lines were roughly twice as large as those used for the higher excitation lines ( table 2 ) .",
    "as shown by liszt & linke ( 1975 ) , derivation of densities via excitation analysis with such data can be very misleading .",
    "densities from such an analysis with better - matched beams have been obtained for this sample by plume et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and we have not analyzed the current data in that way .",
    "instead , we focused on the new feature of these data , which are maps of multiple transitions .",
    "we treated each transition separately and derived mean surface and volume densities for each tracer (  4.4 ) .",
    "we then discussed the difference between these mean densities and those derived by plume et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from excitation analysis .    the sources in this study lie at a large range of distances ( 0.2 to 13.7 kpc ) .",
    "this is an inevitable consequence of our attempt to capture the full range of properties of massive dense clumps , as many of the most extreme star - forming clumps are at large distances .",
    "the effective linear resolution is much worse for the distant clumps , which could bias the determinations of some quantities , such as surface and volume densities , to lower values .",
    "examination of equations 3 , 5 , and 6 would suggest that @xmath190 and @xmath191 if there were no trends in mass with distance . to check the importance of this effect , we plot in figure [ logds4 ] and figure [ logdn4 ] the logarithms of surface and mean volume densities versus the logarithm of distance .",
    "the lines in the plots have slopes fixed to the values suggested above and only the offset is fitted . with substantial scatter , the expected relations are seen .",
    "note that these relations assume that there is no distance effect on the clump masses .",
    "sensitivity limits might lead to more distant clouds being systematically more massive , partly canceling the effects of decreasing resolution .",
    "we would expect no strong trends with distance in line ratio plots , and indeed none are seen ( figure [ dlratio4 ] ) .",
    "maps of over 50 massive , dense clumps in hcn and cs were obtained .",
    "the main sample was drawn from the sample of plume et al .",
    "( 1992 ) selected from water maser surveys and found to have cs 7 - 6 emission .",
    "in addition , we mapped a smaller number of sources of lower luminosity from other surveys .",
    "these are not included in statistics quoted for massive , dense clumps .",
    "we have presented maps of hcn 1 - 0 and 3 - 2 , along with cs 2 - 1 and 7 - 6 .",
    "together with previously published maps of cs 5 - 4 , these provide the basis for analysis of systematics of massive , dense clumps in tracers with a wide range of excitation requirements .",
    "upper state energies in temperature units range from 4.3 k to 66 k , critical densities range from 3.95  to 6.87 , and effective densities range from 4.13 to 2.65 .",
    "as excitation requirements increase , fwhm map sizes shrink , as expected for centrally peaked density distributions .",
    "interestingly , the linewidths increase with excitation requirement , producing an inverse size - linewidth relation , opposite to the one found for low density regions .",
    "the linewidths are highly supersonic , with mach numbers greater than 6 .",
    "these facts suggest that outflows and expanding hii regions are injecting turbulence on small scales .",
    "an alternative would be increased inflow velocities .",
    "virial masses were computed for each of the tracers . because the tracers with higher excitation requirements have smaller fwhm sizes , the virial masses derived from them are less . for the tracers that best trace the whole clump , cs 2 - 1 and hcn 1 - 0 , the mean and median virial masses are 5000 and 1950  ( cs ) , or 5300 and 2700  ( hcn ) . the mean and median infrared luminosities are 4.75  and 1.065 .",
    "these clumps include some of the most massive and luminous star forming regions in the galaxy , such as w43 , w51 , and w49 . for clumps with luminosity above , @xmath192 .",
    "mass surface densities are similar to those needed for high - mass star formation , according to theoretical arguments ( krumholz & mckee 2008 ) . even though only cs 7 - 6 indicates a mean surface density exceeding their threshold of 1 g @xmath6 for massive star formation , the observational and theoretical uncertainties are sufficient to suggest that most of these clumps can form massive stars . and",
    "their high luminosities indicate that indeed they are doing so .",
    "line profiles skewed to the blue , using the blue peak criterion , are common ( 16 examples ) in the sample , but some ( 9 ) are skewed to the red .",
    "this excess of blue over red is less than in the original sample of wu & evans ( 2003 ) , but it still suggests the existence of large scale inflow motions in many clumps .",
    "the line luminosities all correlate very well with virial mass , with different offsets because of the fact that higher excitation transitions trace smaller fractions of the core .",
    "there is no apparent correlation of line luminosity with surface density or volume density , contrary to some recent suggestions ( e.g. , narayanan et al .",
    "line ratios show little correlation with any other properties . in principle ,",
    "ratios of line luminosity should trace density , but in a power - law density distribution , densities range widely and line ratios tend to constant values .    the far - infrared luminosity correlates very well with all the line luminosities .",
    "the correlations are close to linear , with some marginal evidence for lower exponents for lines with the most stringent excitation requirements . while that agrees qualitatively with predictions by narayanan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the effect is much less than the predicted one .",
    "overall , the data support the idea that the linear relation between  and  for starburst galaxies and molecular lines that are hard to excite can be explained if such galaxies have large numbers of massive , dense clumps similar to those in this study . in this case",
    ", the star formation rate in starburst galaxies depends on the total mass of gas above the threshold density or surface density needed for massive star formation , rather than on a local , non - linear form of the schmidt law .",

    "<S> we have mapped over 50 massive , dense clumps with four dense gas tracers : hcn @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; and cs @xmath2 and @xmath3 transitions . </S>",
    "<S> spectral lines of optically thin h@xmath4cn 3 - 2 and c@xmath5s 5 - 4 were also obtained towards the map centers . </S>",
    "<S> these maps usually demonstrate single well - peaked distributions at our resolution , even with higher j transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the size , virial mass , surface density , and mean volume density within a well - defined angular size ( fwhm ) were calculated from the contour maps for each transition . </S>",
    "<S> we found that transitions with higher effective density usually trace the more compact , inner part of the clumps but have larger linewidths , leading to an inverse linewidth - size relation using different tracers . </S>",
    "<S> the mean surface densities are 0.29 , 0.33 , 0.78 , 1.09 g @xmath6 within fwhm contours of cs 2 - 1 , hcn 1 - 0 , hcn 3 - 2 and cs 7 - 6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find no correlation of  with surface density and a possible inverse correlation with mean volume density , contrary to some theoretical expectations . </S>",
    "<S> molecular line luminosities @xmath7 were derived for each transition . </S>",
    "<S> we see no evidence in the data for the relation between  and mean density posited by modelers . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between @xmath7 and the virial mass is roughly linear for each dense gas tracer . </S>",
    "<S> no obvious correlation was found between the line luminosity ratio and infrared luminosity , bolometric temperature , or the @xmath8 ratio . </S>",
    "<S> a nearly linear correlation was found between the infrared luminosity and the line luminosity of all dense gas tracers for these massive , dense clumps , with a lower cutoff in luminosity at @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath10-@xmath11 correlation agrees well with the one found in galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations indicate a constant star formation rate per unit mass from the scale of dense clumps to that of distant galaxies when the mass is measured for dense gas . </S>",
    "<S> these results support the suggestion that starburst galaxies may be understood as having a large fraction of gas in dense clumps . </S>"
