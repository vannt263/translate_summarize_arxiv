    "ted is a nonprofit organization that `` invites the world s most fascinating thinkers and doers [ ... ] to give the talk of their lives '' .",
    "its website makes the video recordings of the best ted talks available under a creative commons license .",
    "all talks have english captions , which have also been translated into many languages by volunteers worldwide .",
    "3  @xcite is a web inventory that offers access to a collection of ted talks , redistributing the original ted website contents through yearly releases .",
    "each release is specifically prepared for supplying train , development and test data to participants at mt and slt tracks of the evaluation campaign organized by the international workshop on spoken language translation ( iwslt ) .    despite almost all english subtitles of ted talks",
    "have been translated into both arabic and hebrew , no iwslt evaluation campaign proposed arabic - hebrew as an mt task .",
    "actually , early releases of 3 distributed train data for hundreds of pairs , including arabic - hebrew .",
    "nevertheless , those linguistic resources were prepared by means of a totally automatic procedure , with only rough sanity checks , and include talks available at that time .    given the increasing interest in the arabic - hebrew task and the many more ted talks translated into the two languages available to date , we decided to prepare a benchmark for arabic - hebrew .",
    "we exploited 3 for collecting raw data ; moreover , for making the dissemination of results easier to users , we borrowed the partition of ted talks into train , development and test sets adopted in the iwslt 2016 evaluation campaign .",
    "the arabic - hebrew benchmark is available for download at :    wit3.fbk.eu/mt.php?release=2016-01-more    in this paper we present the benchmark , list the problems encountered while developing it and describe the methods applied to solve them .",
    "baseline mt results and specific measures on the train sets are given as an extrinsic evaluation of the quality of the generated bitext .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , to date the richest collection of publicly available arabic - hebrew parallel corpora is part of the opus project ; in total , it provides more than 110 m tokens per language subdivided into 5 corpora , opensubtitles2016 being by far the largest .",
    "the opensubtitles2016 collection  @xcite provides parallel subtitles of movies and tv programs made available by the open multilanguage subtitle database .",
    "the size of this corpus makes it outstandingly valuable ; nevertheless , the translation of such kind of subtitles is often less literal than in other domains ( even ted ) , likely affecting the accuracy of the fully automatic processing implemented for parallelizing the arabic and hebrew subtitles .",
    "another arabic - hebrew corpus we are aware of is that manually prepared by   for development and evaluation purposes ; no statistics on its size is provided in the paper , nor it is publicly available ; according to  , it consists of some hundred of sentences , definitely less than those included in our benchmark .",
    "english subtitles of ted talks are segmented on the basis of the recorded speech , for example in correspondence of pauses , and to fit the caption space , which is limited ; hence , in general , the single caption does not correspond to a sentence .",
    "the natural translation unit considered by human translators is the caption , as defined by the original transcript . while translators can look at the context of the single captions , arranging this way any nlp task  in particular mt",
    " would make it particularly difficult , especially when word re - ordering across consecutive captions occurs .",
    "for this reason , we aim to re - build the original sentences , thus making the nlp / mt tasks more realistic .      for each language",
    ", 3 distributes a single xml file which includes all talks subtitled in that language ; the xml format is defined in a specific dtd .",
    "thus , we did not need to crawl any data , as we could download the three xml files of arabic , hebrew and english , available at wit3.fbk.eu/mono.php?release=xml_releases .",
    "even if translators volunteering for ted translated the english captions as pointed out above , sometimes they did not adhere to the source segmentation .",
    "for example , in talk n.  2357 , the english subtitle :    _ french sign language was brought to america dur- + _ ing the early 1800s , _ _",
    "is put between timestamps 53851 and 59091 , while the corresponding arabic translation is split into two subtitles :                     which span the audio recording from 53851 to 56091 and from 56091 to 59091 , and literally mean  french sign language was brought to america \" and `` in the early nineteenth century '' , respectively .    even though the differences produced by translators involve a small amount of captions ( 0.5% in the arabic - hebrew case ) , these differences affect a relevant number of talks ( 9% ) and in them all subtitles following those differently segmented are desynchronized , making the re - alignment indispensable .      for rebuilding sentences , 3 automatic tools leverage strong punctuation . unfortunately",
    ", arabic spelling is often inconsistent in terms of punctuation , as both arabic utf8 symbols and ascii english punctuation symbols are used .",
    "even worse , both in arabic and hebrew translations the original english punctuation is often ignored .",
    "an extreme case is talk n.  1443 where 97% of full stops at the end of english subtitles does not appear in the hebrew translations .",
    "the initial subtitles of that talk are shown in figure  [ fig:1443 ] .    _",
    "i d like to invite you to close your eyes .",
    "+ _ imagine yourself [ ... ] front door of your home .",
    "i d like you to notice the color of the door , + _ the material that it s made out of .",
    "_ _ _ _        note that the strong punctuation of the english side never appears in the hebrew side .",
    "this example also shows the misalignment between subtitles discussed in section  [ sec : alissue ] , being the second english subtitle split into two hebrew subtitles ( the second and the third ) .",
    "the two issues discussed above led us to believe that trying to directly align arabic and hebrew subtitles and rebuild sentences can fail in so many cases that the overall quality of the final bitext can be seriously affected .",
    "we thus designed a two - stage process in which english plays the role of the pivot .",
    "the two stages are described in the two following sections .",
    "the alignment of arabic and hebrew subtitles is obtained by means of the algorithm sketched in figure  [ fig : pivot ] .",
    "the starting point are the xml files of subtitles in the three languages .",
    "english is aligned to arabic and to hebrew ( step 1 in the figure ) by means of two independent runs of gargantua , a sentence aligner described in  @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : alissue ] , the two resulting english sides can be desynchronized , as indeed it is : in one third of the talks , the number of subtitles differs in the two alignments .",
    "then , gargantua is run again to align the two desynchronized english sides ( step 2 ) ; now , the two maps from english to english are used to rearrange the arabic and hebrew sides ( step 3 ) , that at this point are aligned .    the automatic procedure drafted above is not error - proof ; while measuring failures in steps 1 and 3 of the algorithm is unfeasible without gold references , it is simple for step 2 , which should output two perfectly equal english sides ; on the contrary , about 2,000 aligned english subtitles ( out of 530,000 , 0.4% ) are different , involving less than 0.5% of all words .",
    "even if not immune from mistakes , the error rate is so small that can be accepted in our context .",
    "the last stage in the preparation of the arabic - hebrew parallel corpus is the rebuilding of sentences from the aligned subtitles . as discussed in section  [ sec : rebissue ] , we can not rely on strong punctuation occurring in the texts of these two languages . once again",
    ", the english side comes in handy .",
    "in fact , the procedure presented in section  [ sec : pivotal ] outputs the lists of arabic , hebrew and english subtitles perfectly synchronized . since punctuation marks on the english side are reliable , sentences in the three languages are regenerated by concatenating consecutive captions until a proper punctuation mark is detected on the english side .",
    "as of april 2016 , 3 distributes the english transcriptions of 2085 ted talks ; for 2029 of them the arabic translation is available , while 2065 have been translated into hebrew .",
    "the talks common to the three languages ( 2023 ) have been processed by means of the alignment / sentence - rebuilding procedure described in the previous section .",
    "they have been arranged in train / development / test sets following the same partitioning adopted in mt tasks of the iwslt 2016 evaluation campaign . following the iwslt practice ,",
    "the talks that are included in evaluation sets of any past evaluation campaign based on ted talks have been removed from the train sets , even if they do not appear in dev / test sets of this arabic - hebrew release .",
    "for this reason , the release has a total number of aligned talks ( 1908 ) smaller than 2023 .",
    "+ & ar & 153k & 3.55 m + & he & 223k & 3.58 m +    .bilingual resources [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     finally , table  [ tab : sendifflen ] provides the mean and the standard deviation of the difference of the number of tokens between arabic and hebrew subtitles . also here",
    "the statistics on original subtitles ( none ) can be assumed to be the gold reference , and again the pivot version is preferable to the strngp version .      here",
    "we show how the three methods none , strngp and pivot process the example of figure  [ fig:1443 ] . for the sake of readability , only the english translation is given .",
    "all methods properly align original captions .",
    "differences come from the sentence rebuilding .    by definition",
    ", none keeps the five original ar / he subtitles :    _ i d like to invite you to close your eyes .",
    "+ _ imagine yourself standing + _ outside the front door of your home .",
    "i d like you to notice the color of the door , + _ the material that it s made out of .",
    "_ _ _ _ _    strngp , misled by the absence of strong punctuation on the hebrew side , appends together the five subtitles ( and many more ) into one long `` sentence '' :    _ i d like to invite [ ... ] that it s made out of . [ ... ] _    pivot is instead able to properly reconstruct sentences from the original captions :    _ i d like to invite you to close your eyes .",
    "+ _ imagine yourself standing [ ... ] door of your home .",
    "i d like you to notice [ ... ] that it s made out of .",
    "_ _ _    so providing the best segmentation from a linguistic point of view .",
    "in this paper we have described an arabic - hebrew benchmark built on data made available by 3 .",
    "the arabic and hebrew subtitles of around 2,000 ted talks have been accurately rearranged in sentences and aligned by means of a novel and effective procedure which relies on english as the pivot .",
    "the talks count a total of 225k sentences and 3.5 m tokens per language and have been partitioned in train , development and test sets following the split of the mt tasks of the iwslt 2016 evaluation campaign .",
