    "the basic example is a two - band hamiltonian in 2d , which up to a shift in the energy bands has the generic form @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the pauli matrices and @xmath11 is a smooth map from the brillouin torus @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",

    "in particular , the valence band is a line bundle @xmath19 and has the chern number @xmath20 as a topological invariant : @xmath21    while early two - band models @xcite provided examples of valence bands with chern numbers @xmath22 or @xmath23 , one can in principle write down models whose valence bands have arbitrary chern numbers by a judicious choice of the map @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is no particular reason to restrict to two - band models .",
    "the fermi projection @xmath24 onto the occupied states of a gapped hamiltonian determines , more generally , a vector bundle @xmath25 comprising the valence bands , whose chern number is @xmath26 , generalising .",
    "thus , two physically inequivalent situations  a single valence band versus multiple bands  can give rise to the same topological invariant @xmath27 .",
    "they are of course distinguished by the rank , which is the number of filled valence bands .",
    "although the rank @xmath28 is also an honest topological invariant of a bundle @xmath3 , it is sometimes considered uninteresting and thus neglected - invariant for gapped hamiltonians in 0-dimensions , which appears in many versions of the `` periodic table '' in the literature , is nothing but the hilbert space rank . ] .",
    "we aim to show , on the contrary , that the rank is dual in a precise sense to the chern number , so both invariants should be accorded similar status . keeping track of both @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "allows the notion of a dual topological insulator to become apparent .",
    "recall that the ( first ) chern number @xmath29 can also be understood as the integral over the brillouin torus of the first chern class @xmath30 ; the latter can thus be represented ( after normalising the total volume to @xmath31 ) by the differential 2-form @xmath32 . in general , the chern character @xmath33 of a vector bundle @xmath3 over a base manifold @xmath34 is an element of the even cohomology ring of @xmath34 .",

    "then we see that @xmath51 has valence bundle with rank 2 and chern number 1 , and is the dual topological insulator to @xmath6 .",

    "<S> the electronic bands of insulators in @xmath2 spatial dimensions are usually modelled as vector bundles ( or _ bloch bundles _ ) @xmath3 over the brillouin torus @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> such bundles arise , e.g. , in the bloch  floquet decomposition of @xmath5 translation - invariant hamiltonians @xmath6 over the unitary characters @xmath4 of @xmath5 @xcite . in an insulator , </S>",
    "<S> the fermi level lies in a gap of the spectrum of the hamiltonian , distinguishing as sub - bundles the conduction bands from the valence bands . </S>",
    "<S> each of these sub - bundles may be robustly characterised by various topological indices .    in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , haldane introduced an example of what is now called a _ </S>",
    "<S> chern insulator_. there , the first chern number of the filled band in a two - band model provides a topological invariant . like the integer quantum hall effect , it is crucial that time - reversal symmetry is absent . </S>",
    "<S> topological invariants of a dramatically different nature occur in time - reversal invariant systems . </S>",
    "<S> this was first noticed in the seminal papers of @xcite , where the authors showed that the constraint of time - reversal symmetry in their two - dimensional models leads to a @xmath7-valued index distinguishing two topologically distinct phases . </S>",
    "<S> generalising to three dimensions , it was found that four @xmath7 indices could be defined for time - reversal invariant band structures @xcite , three of which refer to `` weak '' topological insulators . </S>",
    "<S> a tantalising pattern began to emerge @xcite and it was kitaev who first noticed that @xmath8-theory and clifford algebras provide an unifying framework for the systematic study of topological insulators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this idea was greatly expanded upon in @xcite , where the fundamental role of the underlying dynamical symmetries was emphasised . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , it became clear that additional point symmetries result in different topological indices @xcite , and that the weak insulators are actually robust and interesting in their own right @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> significantly , the @xmath8-theoretic approach not only encompasses all the above examples , but also explains the phenomenon of dimensional shifts @xcite as made apparent in the periodic table of @xcite , where some of the classes can be realised by topological superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is the natural language to phrase our proposed duality in .    </S>",
    "<S> such theoretical studies are particularly compelling in that they preceded several recent experiments verifying some of the predicted topological phases : the time - reversal invariant quantum spin hall phase was realised in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then the chern insulators were experimentally found in @xcite and @xcite , the latter realising explicitly the haldane model .    </S>",
    "<S> the t - duality isomorphisms which we introduce in this paper , as well as their applications , are explored in greater detail in our subsequent papers @xcite . in particular , we have found that bulk - boundary maps simplify under a t - duality transformation . </S>",
    "<S> these examples demonstrate the conceptual and computational utility of t - duality in the analysis of topological insulator invariants . </S>"
