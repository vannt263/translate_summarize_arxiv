    "the critical properties of frustrated spin systems are still under discussion @xcite .",
    "in particular no consensus exists about the nature of the phase transition in canted magnetic systems .",
    "one example is the stacked triangular lattice with the nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions ( sta ) with vector spins @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of spin components which is always controversial @xcite . the non - collinear ground state due to the frustration leads to a breakdown of symmetry ( bs ) from @xmath5 in the high temperature to @xmath7 in the low temperature .",
    "this is different from ferromagnets in which the ground state is collinear and the bs is @xmath8 .",
    "based on the concept of universality , the class of the transition would be different in the two models .",
    "we generalize this chiral model for a bs of the type @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain the sta model for @xmath9 while we obtain new bs for @xmath10 .",
    "for example , the case @xmath11 should correspond to real experimental systems , this is also applicable in spin glasses where some disorder is present .",
    "several authors have already studied these generalized chiral models applying the renormalization group technic @xcite . in mean field @xcite for @xmath12",
    "the model shows a usual second order type , but for @xmath13 the transition shows a special behavior .",
    "this last result could be interpreted with the bs in this case being @xmath14 and the coupling between the two symmetries leading to some special behavior ( for example , the case @xmath15 in two dimensions ( d ) is always very debated @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath16 expansion gives more information .",
    "the picture is very similar for all @xmath17 ( for details see @xcite and references therein ) . at the lowest order in @xmath18 ,",
    "there are up to four fixed points , depending on the values of @xmath6 and @xmath19 . amongst them",
    "are the trivial gaussian fixed point and the standard isotropic @xmath20 heisenberg fixed point .",
    "these two fixed points are unstable .",
    "in addition , a pair of new fixed points , one stable and the other unstable , appear if the case is @xmath21 with @xcite @xmath22}\\,\\epsilon \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath9 we find the standard result @xmath23 . on the other hand , for @xmath24",
    "we obtain @xmath25 and for @xmath26 we obtain @xmath27 .",
    "a `` tricritical '' line exists which divides a second order region for low @xmath28 and large @xmath6 from a first order region for large @xmath28 and small @xmath6 . from these results",
    "kawamura , using @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , obtained that @xmath31 for all @xmath19 .",
    "thus he concluded that the experimental or numerical accessible systems ( @xmath32 ) were in the second order region .",
    "unfortunately it has been proved that the results of @xmath4 are , at best , asymptotic @xcite .",
    "they have to be resummed to obtain reliable results .",
    "indeed for @xmath9 the calculation of the next order in @xmath18 , combined with a resummation technic , leads the experimental accessible systems for @xmath33 or @xmath34 in the first order region @xcite .",
    "we believe that the same applies for @xmath35 . in order to verify our assumption ,",
    "we have done some simulations for @xmath24 and @xmath26 with @xmath13 and @xmath36 .",
    "the most interesting case is @xmath37 with some possible experimental realizations and connection with the spin glasses .",
    "moreover it is meaningful to study the generalized model in order to have a better overview .",
    "the system we analyze is the stiefel model @xcite .",
    "this model is constructed to have the needed bs .",
    "it is closely connected to real systems with complicating interactions , which are characterized by the same bs ( for the case @xmath9 see @xcite and reference therein ) . from the principle of universality ,",
    "models with the same bs should belong to the same universality class .",
    "moreover we have shown that the use of the stiefel model allows us to avoid problems which are seen in standard models , such as the presence of a complex fixed point ( or minimum in the flow ) @xcite .    in the following section ii the studied models",
    "are presented , we describe the details of the simulations and the finite size scaling analysis .",
    "results will be given in section iii and the last section is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "in this section we introduce different models studied in this work .    first the @xmath38 model which is represented in fig . [ figure1 ] .",
    "the energy of the model is @xmath39}\\ ] ] where the @xmath19 mutual orthogonal @xmath6 component unit vectors @xmath40 at lattice site @xmath41 interact with the next @xmath19 vectors at the neighboring sites @xmath42 .",
    "the interaction constant is here negative to favor alignment of the vectors at different sites .",
    "taking a strict orthogonality between the vectors is similar to removing `` irrelevant '' modes corresponding to the variation between the spins inside the cell .",
    "for example , in the case of a triangular lattice with antiferromagnetic interactions ( sta ) we force the three spins of each cell to have a rigidity constraint with the sum of all the spins being always zero .",
    "the obtained model is equivalent to the sta at the critical temperature and can easily be transformed into the stiefel s @xmath43 model ( for more detail see @xcite ) .",
    "we did not use the clusters algorithm @xcite because it gives worse results than the standard metropolis algorithm for first order transitions .",
    "the method for choosing the random vector depends on the number of components @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath34 we follow the method explained in @xcite for the direct - trihedral model .",
    "we construct two orthogonal vectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and the third vector is constructed by the vector product of the first two : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a random ising variable , corresponding to the ising symmetry present in the @xmath38 model .",
    "this is the difference with the direct - trihedral model defined in @xcite , where no ising symmetry is present .    to simulate the @xmath48 model we follow a similar procedure .",
    "we construct now three orthogonal unit vectors , @xmath49 with @xmath50 , randomly in four dimensions using six euler angles .",
    "the first @xmath51 must be chosen with probability @xmath52 , two other with probability @xmath53 and the rest three @xmath54 with probability @xmath54 .",
    "we obtain for @xmath44 : @xmath55 for @xmath45 : @xmath56 and for @xmath57 : @xmath58    from this model we can easily create the direct - quadrihedral model and the @xmath59 , these two models being composed of four orthogonal vectors with four components .",
    "the differences between the two models are the presence of an ising variables in the @xmath59 where right handed and left handed are allowed while only one possibility exists in the direct - quadrihedral .",
    "the direct - quadrihedral and the @xmath48 models are topologically equivalent , they should have the same low energy physics and therefore belong to the same universality class .",
    "the connection between the direct - trihedral and the @xmath43 models @xcite is very similar to the above .",
    "we form a fourth vector from the vector product of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath57 : @xmath60 for the direct - quadrihedral model , and we add a random ising variable @xmath47 to the @xmath59 model : @xmath61    we follow the standard metropolis algorithm to update one @xmath19-hedral after the other . in each simulation between 20000 to 100 000 monte carlo steps are made for equilibration and averages .",
    "cubic systems of linear dimensions from @xmath62 to @xmath63 are simulated .",
    "the order parameter @xmath64 for this model is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the total magnetization given by the sum of the vectors @xmath67 over all sites and @xmath68 is the total number of sites .    for @xmath13",
    "we define a chirality order parameter : @xmath69 where @xmath70 means the vector product @xmath71 .",
    "we use the histogram mc technique developed by ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite which is very useful for identifying a first order transition .",
    "the finite size scaling ( fss ) for a first order transition has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "a first order transition can be identified by some properties and in particular by the following :    * the histogram @xmath72 has a double peak . *",
    "the magnetization , the chirality and the energy have hysteresis .",
    "the double peak in p(e ) means that at least two states with different energies coexist in the system at one temperature .",
    "we now present our results for the different models . the @xmath38 and",
    "the @xmath59 show a strong first order transition .",
    "the hysteresis in @xmath73 and @xmath74 are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] and [ figure8 ] for the @xmath38 model , and in @xmath73 and @xmath75 for the @xmath59 model in fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] and [ figure10 ] .",
    "this is in accordance with the negative @xmath76 exponent for the @xmath38 model found in @xcite which describes a first order transition because @xmath76 must be positive @xcite .",
    "this result is understandable because there is a coupling between the ising symmetry and the @xmath77 symmetry .",
    "we notice that the @xmath78 model is also of first order @xcite and that the models have a stronger first order transition if @xmath6 is greater ( we obtain the same hysteresis for @xmath79 for the @xmath38 as for @xmath62 for the @xmath59 ) . thus we can generalize our result that the transition is always of first order for @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath48 model shows no hysteresis .",
    "however a double peak structure appears in the energy histogram and becomes more apparent when the size increases ( fig .",
    "[ figure11 ] ) . for greater sizes",
    "the two peaks are well separated by a region of zero probability , the transition time from one state to the other grows exponentially with the size of the lattice .",
    "we should obtains hysteresis in the thermodynamic quantities when the simulation is not too long .",
    "the @xmath48 model has a first order transition but weaker than the direct - quadrihedral model which , for similar sizes , shows hysteresis .",
    "as explained above the two models belong to the same universality class , i.e. a first order transition , similar to the dihedral model @xmath43 and the direct - trihedral model @xcite .",
    "the addition of the fourth leg to the @xmath48 model allows the first order behavior to be more clearly visible . in fig .",
    "[ figure17 ] we have plotted our hypothesis for the rg diagram flow . following the initial point , the flow could be under the influence of a `` complex '' fixed point ( or minimum of the flow @xcite ) and the system mimics a second order transition .",
    "well outside the influence of this fixed point the transition is strongly of first order and in the crossover between these two regions the transition is weakly first order . for a more developed discussion see @xcite .",
    "we have tried to give a general picture of the transition with a @xmath0 breakdown of symmetry . we have shown by numerical simulations that for @xmath11 and @xmath80 , the transition is clearly of first order .",
    "we have generalized our result for all @xmath13 .",
    "a similar conclusion is obtained for @xmath81 and @xmath24 .",
    "using the fact that for @xmath34 and @xmath9 the transition is also of first order , we can generalize our result for all @xmath3 .",
    "this is in contradiction with to the conclusion of kawamura @xcite which is based on two loops of a @xmath4 expansion .",
    "as we have noted the @xmath18 expansion has to be resummed to obtain reliable results .",
    "we can try to achieve this by forming simple pad approximants . for a function @xmath82",
    "we obtain the approximation @xmath83 which we apply to @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath842 , 3 and 4 .",
    "we obtain @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "unfortunately the results can not be perfect and in particular the result for @xmath9 is not close enough to the result including the next order expansion @xmath88 @xcite which demonstrates that the lower - order @xmath18 expansions are useless in this case .",
    "however we remark that the @xmath89 `` resummed '' increases with @xmath19 which is in agreement with our result , i.e. that the initial point in the renormalization flow is farther away from the mimic of the second order region @xcite .",
    "thus the systems will show a stronger first order transition .",
    "this result matches with a recent study on the case @xmath37 which is based on a non perturbative renormalization group procedure @xcite .",
    "we conclude that transitions for @xmath13 and @xmath36 are of first order for all @xmath6 .",
