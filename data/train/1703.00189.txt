    "therefore , we can pin down the value of @xmath170 sharply by using the analytic continuation , if @xmath151 is calculated with lqcd simulations .",
    "in this paper , we investigated properties of the 2 + 1-flavor qcd in the imaginary chemical potential region , that is , qcd with @xmath22 and @xmath1 .",
    "we showed that the qcd thermodynamic potential @xmath57 exhibits the roberge - weiss ( rw ) periodicity when @xmath57 is invariant under the extended @xmath24 transformation .",
    "as an effective model , the polyakov - loop extended nambu  jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model was introduced to visualize the properties on qcd , and we proved that the thermodynamic potential of the pnjl model @xmath81 possesses the same properties as @xmath57 .    by using the pnjl model , we calculated @xmath81 , the imaginary part of quark number density , @xmath172 , and the qcd phase diagram as a function of @xmath5 for two conditions ; ( i ) @xmath7 and ( ii ) @xmath8 . for condition ( i ) , the rw periodicity is seen in all the results .",
    "the structure of the phase diagram is similar to the one in 2-flavor case @xcite . as for condition ( ii ) , there is no rw periodicity , but we found that the region available for the analytic continuation is broader than ( i ) .",
    "the noteworthy points on the phase diagram are ( 1 ) the crossover chiral transition line becomes discontinuos when hitting the rw - like phase transition line , ( 2 ) the first - order deconfinement transition line is asymmetric near the rw - like phase transition line , except for at @xmath134 , ( 3 ) the first - order rw - like phase transition line can be well fitted by a polynomial function of eq .",
    "( [ polynomial ] ) with @xmath173 .",
    "finally , we evaluated the imaginary part of up- and strange - quark number density , @xmath143 and @xmath155 .",
    "we consider the situation that some chemical potentials are fixed to constant values and hence no rw periodicity exists . for @xmath8 and @xmath174 ,",
    "@xmath143 becomes analytic for any temperature .",
    "the condition to realize the analyticity of @xmath151 is @xmath175 .",
    "these results mean that the values of @xmath159 and @xmath160 at temperature of interest can be calculated by the analytic continuation .",
