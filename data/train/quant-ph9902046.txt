    "there is something missing in the foundations of standard quantum theory ( sqt ) which may motivate one to look for a possible deeper theory@xcite .",
    "what sqt lacks is the specification of necessary conditions for when an event occurs .",
    "a sufficient condition _ is _ given : ",
    "upon completion of a measurement by an apparatus , \" after which one is supposed to ",
    "collapse the statevector \" by hand to a state consistent with the outcome of the event .",
    "but this sufficient condition is ill - defined : what s a measurement ?",
    "what s an apparatus ? when is completion ?",
    "do events occur in other circumstances ?    in collapse models , this ill - defined sufficiency condition or",
    " collapse postulate \" of sqt is replaced by a well - defined evolution of the statevector .",
    "collapse takes place dynamically , to a state consistent with the reality we observe around us , with a probability consistent with the predictions of sqt for most ( but not all ) experiments .",
    "this 30 year old program@xcite was reinvigorated by the spontaneous localization ( sl ) model of ghirardi , rimini and weber@xcite ( grw ) a decade ago . at present , the nonrelativistic continuous spontaneous localization ( csl ) model@xcite is the most satisfactory representative of this program .",
    "the constraints on such a model are very severe",
    ". it must give the results of sqt for _ all _ experiments to date .",
    "it must generate a rapid collapse for a statevector which is a superposition of states of a macro - system ( e.g. , an apparatus ) and the result of such a collapse must be a state which we actually observe in nature",
    ". however , there should be negligible collapse of a statevector which is a superposition of states of a micro - system ( e.g. , of a particle undergoing interference ) .",
    "csl consists of two equations .",
    "one is the evolution equation for the statevector .",
    "to schrodinger s equation is added an extra term .",
    "it depends upon a classical fluctuating field @xmath7 which interacts with the number density of particles to cause collapse .",
    "this term contains two parameters introduced by grw : @xmath8sec @xmath9 million years which characterizes the collapse time of an isolated nucleon and @xmath2 cm which characterizes the distance beyond which collapse is most effective .",
    "it also contains dimensionless parameters to characterize the coupling of @xmath7 to different particle types , e.g. , nucleon and electron@xcite .",
    "the second equation of csl is a probability rule .",
    "it gives the probability that a particular @xmath7 is to be found in nature .",
    "since the evolution of the statevector is different in csl than in sqt , this allows for experimental tests .",
    "for example , a possible test is observation of a two slit interference pattern of a `` large object '' such as a @xmath10a sphere of mercury@xcite , since csl predicts that the amplitudes of spatially separated packets will change with time@xcite whereas sqt does not .",
    "while this has so far been too difficult to perform , another kind of test _ has _ been performed .    in csl",
    ", collapse narrows wavefunctions , thereby increasing the energy of particles .",
    "this causes  spontaneous \" excitation of bound states which then radiate@xcite .",
    "experimental data on  spontaneous \" radiation of x - rays in ge , while not yet ruling out csl or sqt , has recently been employed to provide valuable constraints on the parameters of csl@xcite .",
    "it suggests that the coupling of @xmath7 to particles may be proportional to their mass , supporting the idea of a possible connection between collapse and gravity@xcite . also recently ,",
    "it has been pointed out that experiments which place a limit on the lifetime of the proton could provide an even more stringent test@xcite , since the collapse mechanism ought to excite the quarks in the proton , and the decay products of the resulting unstable particle should be observed in proton lifetime experiments .",
    "since quarks move highly relativistically , one must have a relativistic version of csl  which we shall call rcsl in order to make a prediction of the effect of collapse on the proton lifetime .",
    "of course , this is not the only reason to construct a viable relativistic collapse model .",
    "after all , the relativistic symmetry exists in nature .",
    "john bell was so concerned about the problem of making such a model that his first paper on collapse models@xcite and his last paper@xcite dealt with it .",
    "collapse is a nonlocal behavior and it is not obvious how to make a nonlocal relativistic model , but in his first paper he argued that the nonrelativistic grw model s mechanisms did not preclude a relativistic generalization .",
    "indeed , the subsequent discovery of csl made it possible to construct an rcsl model ( rcsl@xmath11)@xcite .",
    "but , in addition to collapsing the statevector , rcsl@xmath11 also has the undesirable feature of creating infinite energy / sec - vol ( i.e. , particles of all energies ) out of the vacuum . in his last paper ,",
    "bell suggested that this difficulty indicates that rcsl@xmath11 is not nonlocal enough , and he speculated that a resolution of the problem might eventually lead to something of fundamental significance .",
    "the reason for this vacuum excitation is as follows . in rcsl@xmath11 , a scalar field ( of mass @xmath12ev )",
    "interacts as usual with the fermion field , and  dresses `` each localized fermion with an average yukawa field amplitude .",
    "now , @xmath7 also interacts with this scalar field in such a way that the dynamics sees the statevector as a superposition of different scalar field amplitude states and attempts to collapse the statevector to one of these . when the statevector is a superposition of different localized fermion states , it is ipso facto a superposition of different scalar field amplitude ' ' dresses \" and the statevector is thereby collapsed toward one such state : this is the desired behavior .    however , the vacuum is also a superposition of different scalar field amplitude states .",
    "rcsl@xmath11 dynamics tries to collapse the vacuum state to one of these .",
    "such an alteration of the vacuum state amounts to exciting scalar particles out of the vacuum .",
    "the result is that the expectation value of the energy in each momentum mode of the scalar field increases linearly with time at the same constant slow rate of about 1 ev per 300 million years . however , there are an infinite number of modes so there is infinite energy production",
    "indeed , in a relativistic theory , if any momentum mode of the vacuum is excited , then all must be excited .",
    "this means that a viable rcsl _ must have no vacuum excitation whatsoever_.      the purpose of this paper is to show one way of eliminating vacuum excitation and obtaining a finite rcsl model .    in rcsl@xmath11",
    ", @xmath7 has the statistics of white noise , so that its spectrum possesses all four - momenta in equal amounts .",
    "although i introduced the idea of describing wavefunction collapse by a stochastic differential schrodinger equation dependent upon white noise@xcite , this was largely for mathematical simplicity .",
    "white noise has all frequencies and physical processes do not , so i have always expected that eventually the spectrum of the noise would be modified . however , until this problem of vacuum excitation arose there had been no reason to make such a modification .",
    "a few years ago i proposed a formalism which generalizes csl so that the spectrum of @xmath7 is adjustable@xcite .",
    "the price paid is that the statevector s evolution is no longer markovian ( i.e. , its future depends upon a past interval ) .",
    "here we shall see that a relativistic version of this formalism allows removal of the culpable four - momenta which excite particles out of the vacuum .",
    "the result is a finite relativistic collapse model for free particles .",
    "section [ sec : cslformalism ] contains a brief introduction to the formalism of csl , and section [ sec : cslexample ] gives an example of its use . in section [ sec : formalism ] , the generalized formalism which allows @xmath7 to have a colored spectrum is introduced . in section [ sec : vac ] , rcsl@xmath11 and its generalized version are discussed and it is shown that the timelike part of the noise spectrum is responsible for producing particles out of the vacuum in lowest order of the perturbation theory expansion of the density matrix .    in section [ sec : rcsl2 ] , this is cured by making the choice of a spacelike spectrum , that of a tachyon of mass @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "it is shown that the nonrelativistic ( @xmath15 ) limit is csl .",
    "it is also pointed out that the scalar field of rcsl@xmath11 may be dispensed with without altering the physical content of the model if the theory just has @xmath7 directly interacting with the particle number density . at this point",
    "we have a model ( which we call rcsl@xmath16 ) with no first order particle production from the vacuum , with sensible first order relativistic collapse behavior and with a sensible nonrelativistic limit .",
    "however , in higher orders than the first there are still particles produced out of the vacuum .",
    "this is because these feynman diagrams contain internal particle lines : the associated feynman propagator can convey arbitrary four - momenta from a tachyon at a vertex to create particles .",
    "one way to eliminate this is to change the evolution equation by relativistically smearing the particle number density in such a way that the four - momenta each vertex allows propagators to exchange with a tachyon is limited .",
    "we shall purse that approach elsewhere , but here ( in sections [ sec : densmatrix ] , [ sec : rcsl ] and the remainder of this paper ) we explore a simpler ( in the sense of not introducing any new functions or constants ) but perhaps more radical way of eliminating this vacuum excitation : by removing the time - ordering operation from the evolution operator .",
    "this puts the propagator on the mass shell , thereby restricting its four - momenta and providing a completely finite collapse model ( rcsl ) to all orders . at each vertex ,",
    "a real particle emits or absorbs a real tachyon .",
    "pair production or annihilation is forbidden at each vertex by energy - momentum conservation , since a pair s timelike four - momentum can not equal a tachyon s spacelike four - momentum . with no pair production ,",
    "there is no particle production from the vacuum .",
    "a big bonus is that there is no need for renormalization .",
    "all diagrams are finite as the physical process at each vertex is finite .",
    "section [ sec : notime ] discusses no time - ordering , pointing out that a perturbation term may be thought of as involving successive forward and backwards - in - time evolutions ( forward with interaction , backwards with free motion ) of the statevector , which can lead to spacelike transport of particles .",
    "section [ sec : particlemotion ] shows how , in time t , the motion of a wavepacket in second order of perturbation theory can result in a particle of mass m having a wavefunction spread out to @xmath17 resulting , at order @xmath6 , in a spread to distance @xmath18 and , at higher orders , in a spread outside the particle s lightcone .",
    "however , because of the large order and the small phase space volume involved , the probability of this is extremely small . in section [ sec : localityrcsl ]",
    "we show that , with neglect of this effect , the model is local in the sense that particles evolve in one region independently of particles in a spacelike separated region .    in section [ sec : results ] we give some results , the collapse rate and energy production rate for a free particle in lowest order .",
    "it seems satisfying that , for the fundamentally nonlocal phenomenon of collapse , in order to eliminate vacuum excitation in relativistic models , we have been led to consider the fundamentally nonlocal relativistic entity : the tachyon .    in what follows ,",
    "i have tried to make the body of the paper as compact and informative as possible , by putting the main argument in the text , and supportive calculations and discussion in appendices .",
    "there are two major ideas behind csl .",
    "one is the gambler s ruin mechanism for ensuring that the collapsed states occur with the probabilities of sqt@xcite .",
    "the other is the grw hitting mechanism for ensuring that the collapse rate is rapid for large objects and slow for small ones , and that the collapsed states are what we see around us , namely localized objects@xcite .",
    "consider the collapse dynamics of statevector @xmath19 and , in particular , the behavior of the squared amplitudes @xmath20 .",
    "this is analogous to the behavior of the dollar amounts @xmath21 in the gambler s ruin game , which is as follows .",
    "suppose two gamblers start with @xmath22 , @xmath23 dollars respectively , where @xmath24 , and they repeatedly toss a coin ( analogous to the fluctuating field @xmath25 ) . depending on the outcome of the toss ,",
    "one gives a dollar to the other , so the @xmath21 fluctuate .",
    "eventually one gambler wins , e.g. , @xmath26 and @xmath27 and the game stops .",
    "it is easy to show that e.g. , gambler 1 wins with probability @xmath28 . with the correspondence @xmath29",
    ", this means that the amplitudes @xmath20 fluctuate , and eventually collapse occurs , e.g. , @xmath30 with probability @xmath31 : just the prediction of sqt !    in grw",
    "s sl model@xcite it is supposed that nature subjects the wavefunction of a collection of particles not only to the usual hamiltonian evolution , but also to random sudden alterations (  hits \" ) . a hit is the multiplication of the wavefunction by a gaussian function @xmath32 , so that the part of the wavefunction which depends upon the nth particle s position @xmath33 is suddenly narrowed to width @xmath34 .",
    "the center of the gaussian , @xmath35 , is randomly chosen according to a certain probability rule which depends upon the wavefunction , and whose effect is to make it most likely that @xmath35 is located where the wavefunction is largest .",
    "such a hit occurs very infrequently on any one particle , at the rate @xmath36 .",
    "however , each particle is equally likely to be hit , and the wavefunction of particles belonging to an apparatus in a superposed state has particles correlated in such a way that _",
    "one _ hit on _ one _ apparatus particle effects a collapse for the _ whole _",
    "n  particle apparatus , so that such a collapse occurs rapidly , in time @xmath37 .    in csl@xcite in effect",
    "a hit occurs every @xmath38 sec , except that the hit wavefunction ( instead of replacing the original wavefunction ) is multiplied by an amplitude @xmath39 and added to the original wavefunction . in this way the wavefunction shape fluctuates , and the gambler s ruin dynamics is obtained .",
    "also , the grw hitting process destroys the ( anti ) symmetry of the wavefunction , and that problem is cured in csl .    the csl modified schrodinger equation for the statevector @xmath40 which evolves under the influence of the fluctuating field @xmath25 is    @xmath41 ^ 2|\\psi , t>\\label{2.1}\\ ] ]    remarkably , this is a linear equation .",
    "all previous models had nonlinear equations , and it was suspected this had to be the case . it should be remarked that it is this linearity which makes relativistic generalizations easy .",

    "csl is completed by giving the probability density functional @xmath49 that a particular realization of the field @xmath7 ( @xmath50 )",
    "occurs :    @xmath51    the statevector evolution ( [ 2.1 ] ) is nonunitary , so the norm of the statevector @xmath40 changes with time : eq .",

    "in his famous 1964 paper@xcite john bell concluded :    `` in a theory in which parameters are added to quantum mechanics to determine the results of individual measurements , without changing the statistical predictions , there must be a mechanism whereby the setting of one measurement device can influence the reading of another instrument , however remote .",
    "moreover , the signal involved must propagate instantaneously , so that such a theory could not be lorentz invariant . ''    in the collapse models discussed here , the additional parameters are the values of the fluctuating field w(x ) at all spacetime points .",
    "the mechanism has two nonlocal aspects .",
    "one is the effect of the probability rule : it correlates field values at spacelike separated points .",
    "for example , this makes highly likely the survival of only one state describing a localized clump of particles when the statevector starts out in a superposition of widely separated clump states .",
    "the other is the effect of the direct product : it can correlate the states of two different widely separated systems .",
    "for example , if the statevector starts out as a sum of direct products , ( an entangled state ) , the collapse suffered by one of the systems brings about the collapse of both to a single product .    in this paper",
    "we have seen that one can construct a lorentz invariant collapse model .",
    "we have been led to considerations of tachyons so as to avoid infinite spontaneous particle production from the vacuum in lowest order while retaining csl collapse behaviorin the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "in retrospect , one might have looked at bell s second sentence cited above and realized that there _ is _ a natural lorentz invariant nonlocal structure which can propagate instantaneously , and so be led to consider tachyons by another route .",
    "the tachyonic structure seems remarkably well matched to the task : it is relativistic , it supplies the spacelike four - momenta needed for collapse , it eliminates vacuum excitation to lowest order , it allows removal of time - ordering so as to eliminate vacuum excitation to all orders without giving a vacuous theory ( as would its replacement by an ordinary particle , one with timelike four - momentum ) , it forces pair production and annihilation to disappear as kinematically untenable thus making the theory finite , it enables a model that is local to a high degree of accuracy . .",
    "the present paper shows one way of obtaining a finite relativistic collapse model , so it may be considered as an existence proof .",
    "elsewhere i shall consider other models that achieve this which use time - ordering , e.g. , a model which employ a relativistically invariant cutoff to restrict energy available for vacuum excitation , and which may be applied to particles which interact .",
    "experiments have suggested mass proportional coupling of particles to the fluctuating field@xcite which implies a connection to gravity .",
    "interestingly , some string theory models conjoin the notions of tachyons and gravity .",
    "it appears that string theorists get rid of the tachyons for various good reasons .",
    "but perhaps tachyons do have a role to play in fundamental physics and , as bell suggested@xcite a connection exists between the resolution of the problem of infinities in quantum field theory as embodied in the string theory program and the resolution of the reality problem .",

    "<S> we explore one way of eliminating such vacuum excitation . </S>",
    "<S> we present a formalism which allows an arbitrary spectrum for @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we point out , in lowest order of perturbation theory , that it is timelike components of this spectrum which are responsible for vacuum excitation but ( appropriate , it seems , to a fundamentally nonlocal phenomenon ) it is spacelike components which are responsible for collapse . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict the spectrum of @xmath0 to that of a tachyon of mass @xmath1ev , where @xmath2 cm is the ghirardi - rimini - weber ( grw ) collapse model scale parameter used in csl </S>",
    "<S> . however , in higher orders than the first , there is still vacuum excitation due to the energy - momentum supplied by particle propagators . </S>",
    "<S> we opt to explore a simple means of eliminating this vacuum excitation : by removing the time - ordering operation from the statevector evolution so that particle propagators are on the mass - shell . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a finite theory : there is no vacuum excitation ( and no need for renormalization ) as each vertex describes a finite physical process , the spontaneous emission / absorption of a real tachyon by a particle ( pair creation / annihilation is not permitted by energy - momentum conservation ) . </S>",
    "<S> this process may be thought of as analogous to the grw  hitting \" description of collapse . </S>",
    "<S> the cost of no time - ordering is that at each vertex a mass @xmath3 particle s wavefunction can spread by as much as @xmath4 in time @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this has the result that , beginning at perturbation order @xmath6 , there is a nonvanishing probability for the particle to be found outside its lightcone : for electrons and nucleons , the probability of this spacelike transport is negligibly small . </S>",
    "<S> apart from this effect , the density matrix of particles in one region evolves independently of particles in another spacelike separated region . </S>",
    "<S> we thus obtain a finite , reasonably sensible , relativistic collapse model for free particles . </S>"
