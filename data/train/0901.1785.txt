    "the masses of quarks and charged leptons are dictated by the yukawa sector in the standard model ( sm ) through the simple and elegant higgs mechanism , where the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field , determined by massive gauge bosons , indicates the scale of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) with @xmath7 gev . according to the data ,",
