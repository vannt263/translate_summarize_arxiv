    "since the first investigations of galaxy interactions @xcite using light bulbs , the use of numerical simulations in galaxy formation has developed dramatically . not only gravity but also hydrodynamics and cooling are standard ingredients in the sophisticated computer models studying galaxy formation and interactions . in hierarchical structure formation ,",
    "dark matter ( dm ) halos merge to form larger halos while the gas infalls into these potential wells @xcite .",
    "@xcite provided the basis for modern galaxy formation , in which small galaxies form early and continuously merge into larger systems .",
    "as more high redshift galaxies were observed in the following 10 years , @xcite refined the theory to address the observed characteristics in these galaxies . in their model ,",
    "the halo accumulates mass until the gas cools faster than a hubble time , @xmath11 , which usually occurs when atomic hydrogen line , specifically ly@xmath12 , cooling is efficient .",
    "this happens when the halo has @xmath13  @xmath14  10@xmath15 k , where the cooling function sharply rises by several orders of magnitude because the number of free electrons able to excite hydrogen greatly increases at this temperature @xcite .",
    "one can define a cooling radius , @xmath16 , in which the interior material is able to cool within a hubble time .",
    "once the halo reaches this first milestone , @xmath16   increases through additional accretion and cooling .",
    "a rapid baryonic collapse ensues when @xmath17  @xmath18  @xmath19   @xcite .",
    "the material accelerates towards the center , and its density quickly increases . in the model discussed in white & frenk ,",
    "this collapse will halt when one of the following circumstances occurs .",
    "first , angular momentum can prevent the gas from collapsing further , and the system becomes rotationally supported .",
    "afterwards , this disc fragments and star formation follows .",
    "alternatively , star formation does not necessarily develop in a disc component , but the energy released by stars during their main sequence and associated supernovae ( sne ) terminates the collapse .",
    "these concepts have been applied also to the earliest galaxies in the universe @xcite .",
    "many studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) demonstrated that ob - stars within protogalaxies at @xmath20 can produce the majority of photons required for reionization .",
    "these protogalaxies contain an ample gas reservoir for widespread star formation , and the accompanying radiation propagates into and ionizes the surrounding neutral intergalactic medium .",
    "several high redshift starburst galaxies have been observed that host ubiquitous star formation at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "additionally , supermassive black holes ( smbh ) more massive than 10@xmath21 are present at these redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ". finally , a reionization signature in the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at z @xmath0 10 @xcite further supports and constrains stellar and smbh activity at high redshifts .",
    "the distinction between smbh formation and a starburst galaxy should depend on the initial ingredients ( i.e. seed bhs , metallicity , merger histories ) of the host halo , but the evolution of various initial states is debatable .",
    "it is essential to study the hydrodynamics of high redshift halo collapses because the initial luminous object(s ) that emerges will dynamically and thermally alter its surroundings .",
    "for example , as the object emits ultraviolet radiation , the nearby gas heats and thus the characteristic jeans mass increases , which may inhibit the accretion of new gas for future star formation @xcite .    the following work will attempt to clarify early galaxy formation by focusing on protogalactic ( @xmath13  @xmath22 k ) halos and following their initial gaseous collapse .",

    "the progressive introduction of new processes is essential to understand the relevance of each mechanism .",
    "we argue that our results may be relevant for scenarios that envisage smbh formation from gaseous collapses .",
    "@xcite and @xcite conducted smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations that focused on the collapse of idealized , isolated protogalactic halos .",
    "the former group concluded that a central @xmath24 smbh must exist to stabilize the thin gaseous disc that forms in their calculations .",
    "@xcite considered cases with and without h@xmath23  chemistry and a background uv radiation field . they observed the formation of a dense object with a mass @xmath25 , or @xmath26 of the baryonic matter , in simulations with no or strongly suppressed h@xmath23  formation .",
    "these calculations without metal cooling and stellar feedback are useful to explore the hydrodynamics of the collapse under simplified conditions .",
    "@xcite analytically studied the collapse of 10@xmath15 k halos with an atomic equation of state .",

    "@xcite also found that @xmath05% of the gas mass in @xmath28 halos at @xmath29 becomes unstable in a gaseous disc and forms a smbh .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the effects of metal and dust cooling on the fragmentation of a collapsing protogalactic core with varying metallicities ( @xmath30 ) and found the gas fragmenting ten times as much in the @xmath31 case than the primordial case .",
    "in addition , the fragments in the primordial case are biased toward larger masses .",
    "a runaway gaseous collapse requires angular momentum transport so material can inflow to small scales and form a central object .",
    "the stability of rotating gaseous clouds have been subject of much interest over the last four decades and was thoroughly detailed by the work of ( * ? ? ?",

    "their boundary conditions with each other are treated as any other adaptive grid .",
    "the finest grid has an equivalent resolution of a 1024@xmath6 unigrid and a side length of 250 ( 300 ) comoving kpc .",

    "we evolve the system until the central object has collapsed and reached our resolution limit .",
    "if we were to follow the simulation to later times and focus on subsequently collapsing halos , the nature of the gaseous collapses in these halos should be similar because we do not consider any non - local feedback processes that affect neighboring halos . at redshift 15 ,",

    "thus we argue that the results presented here should be applicable to all high - redshift protogalactic collapses .",
    "there are 1.23 @xmath3 10@xmath5 ( 498@xmath6 ) and 7.40 @xmath3 10@xmath4 ( 420@xmath6 ) unique cells in the final simulation output of simulations a and b , respectively .",
    "the finest grid then has a refinement level of 41 and a spatial resolution of roughly 0.01 of a solar radius in both simulations .",

    "in this section , we first describe how the halo collapses when it starts to cool through ly@xmath12  line emission .",
    "then we discuss the role of turbulence in the collapse .",
    "last we describe the rotational properties and stability of the halo and central object .          beginning at z = 21.1 in simulation a , the progenitor of the final halo (  = 4.96 @xmath3 10@xmath65 ) starts to experience two major mergers , which continues until z = 17.2 when  = 2.36 @xmath3 10@xmath66 .",

    "the filamentary large - scale structure is shown , and the protogalactic halo exists at the intersection of these filaments . in the next scale , we show the protogalactic gas cloud . at the 100 pc scale ,",
    "a thick disc is seen in simulation b. it is nearly edge - on and oriented northwest to southeast in this view . in simulation b at 1 pc , a bar forms from a rotational secular instability that transports angular momentum outwards .",
    "similar instabilities exist at radii of 0.2 pc , 2700 au , 17 au , 0.5 r@xmath69 in simulation b. simulation a also undergoes a secular bar instability at smaller scales at radii of 150 au , 1.3 au , 0.8 r@xmath69 but shows a more disorganized medium at larger scales .    the virial temperatures are now @xmath70 k , and therefore they can efficiently cool by atomic hydrogen transitions . the gas fulfills the critical condition for contraction , @xmath19  @xmath14 @xmath17 , and proceeds to continuously collapse on approximately a dynamical time .",
    "we note that this collapse and level of fragmentation are strongly influenced by the magnitude of radiative cooling that the gas can acheive . here",
    "we present the case in which the gas cools without any external radiation backgrounds or radiation trapping , which may alter the nature of the collapse .",
    "figure [ fig : tempelec1 ] depicts slices of electron fraction and gas temperature at scales of 200 and 1500 pc . at the larger scale , the gas is heated both in virial shocks at @xmath71 pc and internal turbulent shocks .",
    "gas within the virial radius varies between @xmath02000 k in cold inflows from filaments and up to 30,000 k in turbulent shocks .",
    "electron fractions increase to up to 0.5% because of collisional ionizations behind the shocks",
    ". the majority of the ionizations occur in the turbulent shocks inside  where the densities are greater and temperatures at the shocks are similar to values in the virial shock .",
    "in addition , 84% of the cooling radiation originates in converging flows ( @xmath72 ) . in the inner 200 pc ,",
    "turbulent shocks are widespread as seen in the temperature variations .",
    "however these are less pronounced than the one at larger radius . in the central 50 pc ,",
    "the gas becomes nearly isothermal despite the low free electron fraction .",
    "the halo collapses in two stages .",
    "we denote the beginning of the first stage when @xmath19  @xmath14 @xmath17  for the first time . the second stage begins when the central object becomes gravitationally unstable .",
    "_ cooling stage_ as mass infalls toward the center , the increased cooling rate , which is @xmath73 until ly@xmath12  radiation becomes trapped within the inner condensation at a density of @xmath74 @xcite , catalyzes the collapse as atomic line transitions convert kinetic energy to radiation . here",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath75 are the number density of baryons and electrons , respectively .",
    "although we do not treat the radiative effects of ly@xmath12 , radiation trapping from recombination lines can not prevent the collapse @xcite .",
    "this first stage starts 520 ( 40 ) kyr before the last output .",
    "the inner 100 pc have a steady decrease in electron fraction that indicates atomic hydrogen cooling is now efficient in this region , which can be seen in the 200 pc slices of figure [ fig : tempelec1 ] .",
    "however , only the gas within 1.5 ( 1.0 ) pc has @xmath19",
    "@xmath76 @xmath17  = 383 ( 100 ) kyr at this epoch .",
    "_ gravitationally unstable stage_ this starts when the central region becomes unstable to gravitational collapse . @xcite and @xcite investigated the stability of an isothermal sphere with an external pressure @xmath77 and discovered that the critical mass ( be mass hereafter ) for gravitational collapse is @xmath78 if we set @xmath77 to the local pressure , then @xmath79 where @xmath80 = 5/3 is the adiabatic index .",
    "for both simulations , this stage occurs between 10 and 100 kyr before we end the simulation .",
    "we plot the ratio of the enclosed gas mass and be mass in figure [ fig : mbe ] for several epochs in the collapse . when the clump becomes gravitationally unstable , the central 3.3 @xmath3 10@xmath10 ( 5.5 @xmath3 10@xmath15 ) @xmath60 in the central @xmath81 = 5.8 ( 0.9 ) pc exceeds the be mass , and its @xmath19  = 520 ( 80 ) kyr .",
    "thus our numerical results agree with these analytic expectations .",
    "we follow the evolution of the accretion and contraction until the simulation reaches a refinement level of 41 ( 41 ) that corresponds to a resolution of 0.01 ( 0.014 ) r@xmath69 . at this point , the central 4.7 @xmath3 10@xmath10 ( 1.0 @xmath3 10@xmath10 )",

    "the central number density is 5.8 ( 7.6 ) @xmath3 10@xmath9 cm@xmath58 .",
    "we repeat that this isothermal collapse occurs through atomic hydrogen cooling only , but in reality , h@xmath23  cooling is important even in the presence of a ultraviolet background ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "thus our results should only be considered as a scenario for excellent numerical experiments of turbulent collapses ( see  [ sec : applicability ] for more discussion ) .",
    "next we show the radial profiles of the final and preceding outputs in figures [ fig : profilesa ] and [ fig : profilesa3 ] , where we plot ( a ) enclosed gas mass , ( b ) number density , ( c ) mass - weighted temperature , and ( d ) mass - weighted radial velocity .",
    "figure [ fig : profilesa ] focuses on length scales greater than 20 au to @xmath85 .",
    "the halo collapses in a self - similar manner with @xmath86 .",
    "we also overplot the dm density in units of m@xmath87 in the @xmath88 panels .",
    "the dm density in simulation a does not flatten as much as simulation b with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively , yet higher dm resolution simulations will be needed to address the significance of this difference in central slopes . in the @xmath91 panels , ones sees that the entire system is isothermal within 10% of 8000 k. in the @xmath92 panels , the sound speed @xmath93 in the final epoch is plotted , and there is a shock where @xmath94 at a mass scale when @xmath95 first exceeded @xmath96 . here",
    "@xmath97 is the radial velocity , and @xmath93 is the local sound speed .",
    "figure [ fig : profilesa3 ] shows the data within 1 pc at times 100 years before the end of the simulation .",
    "the self - similar , isothermal collapse continues to stellar scales .",
    "however , the structure in the radial velocity in simulation b exhibits a strikingly behavior with four repeated minima at mass scales @xmath98 , @xmath99 , 6 , and @xmath100 .",
    "we attribute this to rotational bar - like instabilities that we discuss later in the paper (  [ sec : rotinstab ] ) .",
    "if we consider @xmath97 constant from the last output , we can determine the infall times , which are shown in figure [ fig : infall ] .",
    "the infall time , @xmath101 , of the shocked be mass is 350 ( 50 ) kyr .",

    "; above this mass interval , the slope of the mass infall times increase to @xmath107 .",
    "the increased radial velocities when the central object becomes gravitationally unstable causes the steepening of the slope at @xmath0@xmath108 .      in simulation",
    "b , a thick disc with a radius of 50 pc and disc scale height of @xmath010 pc forms that is pressure supported and only partially rotationally supported .",
    "the circular velocities within this disc achieve only a third of keplerian velocities .",
    "the lack of full rotational support and large scale height suggests that a central collapse occurs before any fragmentation in this large - scale disc is possible .",
    "in contrast , we see a disorganized , turbulent medium and no large scale disc formation in simulation a.      @xcite described a theory of the basic behavior of incompressible turbulence that is driven on a large scale and forms eddies at that scale .",
    "these eddies then interact to form smaller eddies and transfer some of their energy to smaller scales .",
    "this cascade continues until energy is dissipated through viscosity . in supersonic turbulence ,",
    "most of the turbulent energy is dissipated through shock waves , which minimizes the local nature of cascades found in incompressible turbulence .    in paper",
    "i , we found that turbulence is stirred during virialization .",
    "when radiative cooling is efficient , the gas can not virialize by gaining thermal energy and must increase its kinetic energy in order to reach equilibrium , which it achieves by radial infall and turbulent motions .",
    "in addition to virial turbulence generation , mergers stir turbulence . here",
    "the largest driving scale will be approximately the scale of the merging objects , and the turbulent cascade starts from that length scale .",
    "additional driving may come from kelvin - helmholtz instabilities of a multi - phase gas as the mergers occur @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered mergers of galaxy clusters , however his work may still apply to the formation of protogalactic halos since similar temperature contrasts exist in this regime of mergers .",
    "as the lighter halo falls into the massive halo , a bow shock and small - scale eddies from the kelvin - helmholtz instability form between the two interacting objects . at later times , a dense , cool core remains in the substructure of the lesser halo .",
    "the instabilities grow and destroy the baryonic substructure , and the gas mixes with the existing gas of the massive halo and becomes turbulent .    to quantify aspects of this turbulence",
    ", we inspect the turbulent mach number , @xmath109 here @xmath110 is pressure , @xmath111 is the 3d velocity dispersion , and @xmath80 is the adiabatic index that we set to 5/3 .",

    "radial profiles of @xmath112 are shown in figure [ fig : mach ] . before the core becomes gravitationally unstable , the turbulence is subsonic within the virial shock .",
    "after the core becomes gravitationally unstable , the turbulent mach number rises to 24 .",
    "the collapse produces turbulence on a timescale that is faster than it can be dissipated .    the turbulence that exists before the initial collapse may impact the nature of the central object . in simulation",
    "a , the core initially has @xmath113 , and this results in a central object with 4.7 @xmath3 10@xmath114 and a radius of 7.9 pc .",
    "the core in simulation b has @xmath115 , and the central object is about five times less massive and smaller , which corresponds to a free - fall time approximately five times shorter as well .      during the hierarchical buildup of structure , tidal forces from neighboring structures",
    "impart angular momentum to a halo , particularly when its radius is maximal at the turn - around time @xcite .",
    "however in recent years , several groups have recognized that the mergers may impart a considerable fraction of angular momentum to the system @xcite . over many realizations of mergers ,",
    "the net angular momentum change would be zero .",
    "in reality , an angular momentum residual remains after the last major merger occurs because there are too few events to cancel the randomization of halo spin .",
    "although each halo has unique rotational properties , it is useful to define a dimensionless spin parameter @xmath116 where g is the gravitational constant and l , e , and m are the angular momentum , energy , and mass of the object , that measures the rigid body rotation of the halo @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : spin ] , we display the time evolution of @xmath117 of the dm and baryons in our simulations and mark the occurrence of the major merger in simulation a. @xcite ( preceded by * ? ? ?",

    "also @xmath117 weakly depends on its merger history , where @xmath119 increases during mergers and slowly dissipates afterwards .",
    "most of the angular momentum is acquired from steady minor mergers and accretion because major mergers only happen rarely ( usually only once per logarithmic mass interval ) . in 96% of mergers",

    "the above evolution of @xmath117 agrees with the findings of hetznecker & burkert .",

    "however there exists the `` angular momentum problem '' , where many orders of magnitude of angular momentum must be shed ( see  6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the initial molecular cloud to form a central star , star cluster , or bh . in our simulations",
    ", there is a clear scenario in which the inside - out collapse @xcite proceeds even if the initial turbulent cloud was rotating .",
    "we see three major elements affecting angular momentum transport during the collapse .",
    "_ angular momentum distribution_ in cosmological halos , there is a universal distribution of angular momentum @xmath172 that measures the mass with a specific angular momentum less than @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "this function is fitted with two parameters , @xmath43 and @xmath174 , where @xmath43 controls the flattening of the power law at high angular momenta , and @xmath174 determines at which @xmath173 this transition occurs .",
    "@xcite also find that more mass resides in the tails of the distribution , especially at small @xmath173 , when compared to a system in solid body rotation .",
    "thus all halos have some intrinsic amount of gas with small @xmath173 . if this distribution is maintained during the collapse ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such gas can collapse to some small radius , @xmath175 , without becoming rotationally supported , which leads to the next element of discussion  angular momentum segregation .",
    "_ segregation in a turbulent medium_ in paper i , we determined that most of the gas becomes supersonically turbulent as a result of virialization .",
    "therefore let us theorize how angular momentum transport happens during the transition from being pressure supported to rapidly cooling and collapsing .",
    "first consider a turbulent uniform - density gas cloud , where parcels of gas at a specific radius can have many different values of @xmath173 .",
    "this differs from the organized rotation of a disc .",
    "if we start with such an initial configuration , how does angular momentum transport occur during the collapse ?",
    "gas with small ( high ) @xmath173 will preferentially migrate to small ( large ) radii , following turbulent flow lines . in an axi - symmetric system , the rayleigh criterion @xcite requires that the specific angular momentum must be a monotonically increasing function with respect to radius .",
    "the gas with the lowest @xmath173 progressively piles up in the center of dm potential wells until @xmath17  @xmath64  @xmath19  when it can catastrophically cool and collapse .",
    "such low @xmath173 gas may originate in lower mass progenitors because the gas resided in shallow potential wells ( i.e. low mass halos ) that led to smaller turbulent and thermal velocities .",
    "we argue that this effect is intimately linked to the gas acting to achieve virial equilibrium at all stages during the collapse ( see paper i ) .",
    "furthermore , the system becomes unstable to turbulence as the material segregates .",
    "this onset of turbulence can be delayed if viscosity is large enough so that reynolds numbers are below the order of @xmath176 or @xmath99 .",
    "however there are many modes of instability if the rayleigh criterion is not met , and even gas with a low reynolds number will eventually become fully turbulent on a timescale that is chaotic , depending on the initial perturbation and reynolds number @xcite .",
    "we note that a more comprehensive approach would consider the solberg - hiland criterion @xcite that generalizes this to include partial rotational and pressure support in a disc .",
    "_ bar - like rotational instabilities_ after sufficient amounts of gas have migrated to small radii because of angular momentum segregation , this gas increases its rotational velocity as it conserves angular momentum .",
    "gas with similar angular momentum now obtains some organized rotational velocity . as the rotational energy increases",
    ", some shells may become rotationally unstable ( @xmath177 ) in a secular @xmath178 mode . in the case of a collapsing gas cloud",
    ", turbulent viscosity provides the dissipative force that drives the secular instability .",
    "the system then deforms into a bar - like object , where the gas with large @xmath173 moves to larger radius and gas with small @xmath173 can infall to even smaller radii .",
    "the combination of these three processes alleviates the `` angular momentum problem '' of inside - out collapses .",
    "such a scenario of angular momentum transport during a self - similar collapse may be widely applicable in cosmological collapse problems .",
    "our simulations follow the self - similar collapse of protogalactic halos over 14 orders of magnitude in length .",
    "we find that a cascade of three ( four ) bar - like instabilities occur during the latter stages of the collapse . the ratios of mass enclosed in each successive instability varies from 10 to 10,000 in our simulations . as a consequence of these instabilities , the collapse of the densest point never halts because of rotational support . instead the gas becomes rotationally unstable when it gains sufficient rotational energy .",
    "the lowest @xmath173 gas then falls to smaller radius and may become unstable yet again .",
    "this sequence could repeat itself several times .",
    "in addition , we find that rotational instabilities are possible without a global disc as in simulation a.    this is the `` bars within bars '' scenario originally proposed to fuel active galactic nuclei through dynamical rotational bar - like instabilities @xcite .",
    "it was then adapted for funneling enough gas into pre - galactic ( @xmath179 ) smbhs by @xcite , in whose framework the angular momentum of the disc , where the instability occurs , depends on the spin parameter of the halo ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "thus the amount of gas available for accretion onto the central smbh also depends on the spin parameter .",
    "dynamical instabilities require 45% more rotational energy to occur than secular ones . in the framework of @xcite , only requiring secular instabilities may result in a larger fraction of halos forming a pre - galactic smbh because of the log - normal distribution of spin parameters ( eq . [ eqn : lambda_prob ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we do not advocate our simulations as evidence of pre - galactic smbh formation because we have neglected many important processes related to h@xmath23  cooling and primordial star formation that we detail briefly in the next section .",
    "our results depict the importance of turbulence , accretion , and the hydrogen cooling in the initial collapse of these halos .",
    "however we are missing some essential processes , such as h@xmath23  chemistry , primordial and population ii stellar formation and feedback , smbh formation and feedback , and metal transport and cooling .",
    "it was our intention to study only the hydrogen and helium cooling case first and gradually introduce other processes at a later time to investigate the magnitude and characteristics of their effects , which we will present in later papers .",
    "gas becomes optically thick to ly@xmath12  radiation above column densities of @xmath0@xmath180 @xmath181 , and ly@xmath12  radiation trapping becomes important above a density of @xmath0@xmath182 @xcite .",
    "we continue to use optically thin cooling rates above this density .",
    "thus we overestimate the cooling within 0.03 pc . as a consequence",
    ", we do not suggest that these simulated objects ever form in nature .",
    "however this scenario poses an excellent numerical experiment of turbulent collapse , which should be common in galaxy formation , where turbulence is generated during virialization , and star formation within turbulent molecular clouds .",
    "clearly local dwarf spheroidals contain stars with ages consistent with formation at very high redshifts @xcite . to develop a model that desires to fit galaxy luminosity functions down to the faintest observed galaxies",
    "one may need a star formation and feedback model that follows molecular clouds as small as one thousand solar masses in order to allow for the dominant mode of star formation observed locally .",
    "it should be already technologically feasible with current cosmological hydrodynamical models to simulate these galaxies one star at a time .",
    "correct initial conditions for early galaxy formation require prior star and bh formation and feedback .",
    "the typically adopted conditions for phenomenological star formation are velocity convergence , a critical overdensity , @xmath19  @xmath14 @xmath17 , and being jeans unstable @xcite .",
    "phenomenological primordial star formation is possible if we include two additional conditions as utilized in @xcite .",
    "first , the h@xmath23  fraction must exceed 10@xmath58 @xcite , and second , the metallicity of the gas must not exceed some `` critical metallicity '' of 10@xmath58  10@xmath183 of the solar value @xcite . from prior studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the lyman - werner radiation from massive stars can dissociate h@xmath23  from large distances @xcite , suppress star formation in lower mass halos @xcite , and should be considered to accurately model future star formation .",
    "bh formation in the death of some primordial stars can also have a profound effect on surrounding structure formation as it accretes infalling matter during later mergers . in principle",
    ", one should include feedback of seed bhs from primordial stars with masses outside of the range between 140 and 260 solar masses .",
    "also it is possible to phenomenologically model smbh formation in a similar manner as the stellar case .",
    "if the protogalactic collapse occurs faster than stellar formation timescale of a massive star , a smbh may form inside this region .",
    "using the stellar formation conditions plus this condition and allowing the particle to accrete ( i.e. sink particles ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , protogalactic collapses can be followed in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "these sink particles should regulate the accretion with an appropriate subgrid model .",
    "important processes include an appropriate accretion rate ( e.g. eddington or bondi - hoyle ) , turbulence @xcite , rotational support of the infalling gas , and a viscosity timescale for accretion discs .    for small galaxies",
    ", radiative transfer effects can have a great impact ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and should not be neglected .",
    "ionization front instabilities in these galaxies create cometary small - scale structure and shadowing effects as a result from the explicit treatment of three - dimensional radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "stellar feedback can have both a positive and negative impact on subsequent star formation .",
    "some examples of positive feedback include enhanced h@xmath23  formation in relic regions @xcite and dust and metal - line cooling @xcite .",
    "negative feedback may occur from baryonic expulsion from host halos @xcite and halo photoevaporation @xcite .",

    "this method has also been independently implemented into _",
    "enzo _  by @xcite .",
    "finally as used in many stellar formation routines @xcite , we hope to include thermal and radiative feedback from population ii stars in future studies .",
    "we have simulated the hydrodynamics and collapse of a protogalactic gas cloud in two cosmology amr realizations .",
    "our focus on the hydrodynamics presents a basis for future studies that consider stellar and bh feedback . in the idealized case presented",
    ", we find a central dense object forms on the order of 10@xmath114 and @xmath184 pc .",
    "this central object is not rotationally supported and does not fragment in our simulations .",
    "however our results do not dismiss disc formation in protogalaxies because rotationally supported disc formation may begin after the initial central collapse .",
    "disc formation may be sensitively affected by feedback from the central object .",
    "these simulations highlight the relevance of secular bar - like instabilities in galaxy formation and turbulent collapses .",
    "similar bar structures are witnessed in primordial star formation simulations .",
    "as low angular momentum infalls , it gains rotational energy as it conserves angular momentum .",
    "this induces an @xmath185 = 2 , bar - like instability that transports angular momentum outwards , and the self - similar collapse can proceed without becoming rotationally supported and exhibits a density profile @xmath186 .",
    "this process repeats itself as material infalls to small scales that is indicative of the `` bars within bars '' scenario .",
    "we see three and four occurrences of embedded secular instabilities in the two realizations studied here .",
    "we also find that supersonic turbulence influences the collapse by providing a channel for the gas to preferentially segregate according to its specific angular momentum .",
    "the low angular momentum material sinks to the center and provides the material necessary for a central collapse . here",
    "the possibilities of a central object include a direct collapse into a smbh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "all of these cases are viable in the early universe , and the occurrence of these cases depends on the merger history , local abundances in the halo , and the existence of a seed bh . moreover , star formation should occur whether a central bh exists or not .",
