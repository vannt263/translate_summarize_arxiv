    "optimal control theory @xcite has been extensively used recently for the design of pulses that optimize the performance of various nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and quantum systems limited by the presence of relaxation @xcite , the dissipation due to random interactions between the system and its environment . in this letter",
    ", we employ tools from optimal control to derive minimum - energy @xmath0 and @xmath1 pulses for a simple nmr system described by the bloch equations . in particular ,",
    "we study the case where transverse relaxation dominates the dissipation of the system and the control amplitude is bounded .",
    "the problem of optimal control of the bloch equations and its closely related corresponding problem for a two - level quantum system have received considerable attention .",
    "d alessandro and dahleh @xcite considered the problem of minimum - energy optimal control for a two - level quantum system without dissipation .",
    "boscain and mason @xcite examined the time minimal problem for a spin-@xmath2 particle in a magnetic field neglecting dissipation .",
    "sugny , kontz and jauslin @xcite , bonnard and sugny @xcite and bonnard , chyba and sugny @xcite studied extensively the problem of time - optimal control for a dissipative two - level quantum system .    in our recent work , we studied the problem of designing minimum - energy @xmath0 and @xmath1 pulses for the bloch system dominated by the transverse relaxation with unlimited control amplitude @xcite .",
    "this dissipative system is of great practical importance as it is a very good approximation for many applications of interest . in this article",
    ", we extend this previous work to consider the case where the control amplitude is limited , which accounts for realistic limitations of the experimental setup and also makes the problem more interesting from a control theoretic perspective .    in the next section ,",
    "we formulate the related optimal control problems of such pulse designs .",
    "the solutions of these problems are presented in section 3 , which is the main contribution of this article .",
    "then in section 4 , we present some examples to demonstrate our analytical results .",
    "in a resonant rotating frame , the bloch equations with the longitudinal relaxation neglected are of the form @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the magnetization vector , @xmath5 are the transverse components of the magnetic field and @xmath6 is the transverse relaxation rate .",
    "the above equations constitute a dissipative bilinear control system . by the following change of variables ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3d ] ) and time rescaling @xmath7 we arrive at a new system @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the normalized components of transverse magnetic field perpendicular and parallel to @xmath10 , respectively .    note that @xmath11 does not affect the angle @xmath12 of the pulse .",
    "it just rotates @xmath13 around @xmath14-axis , resulting in a waste of energy .",
    "thus , optimality requires that @xmath15 and hence @xmath16 .",
    "if for example we choose @xmath17 to be parallel to the @xmath18-axis , then @xmath19 and @xmath13 rotates in @xmath20-plane , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] .",
    "this is the case that we consider in this letter .",
    "equations ( [ magnitude ] ) and ( [ angle ] ) are sufficient to describe this rotation .    [",

    "to conclude , in this letter we calculated minimum - energy @xmath0 and @xmath1 pulses for bloch equations in the case where transverse relaxation dominates and the control amplitude is bounded , using optimal control theory .",
    "this work is expected to find applications in nmr spectroscopy , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and quantum information processing , serving as a reference for numerical studies of more complicated and realistic situations that incorporate for example longitudinal relaxation and magnetic field inhomogeneity ."
