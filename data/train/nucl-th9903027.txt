    "the calculation of the charge form factors , @xmath8 , and density distributions , @xmath9 of nuclei , is a challenging and appealing problem @xcite .",
    "a possibility to face this problem is by means of an independent particle model .",
    "this approach , which is particularly attractive because of its simplicity , fails to reproduce the high momentum transfer data from electron scattering in nuclei . for this reason",
    "a modification of the single particle ( sp ) potentials has to be suitably made .",
    "in fact a short range repulsion in this potential seems advisable for light nuclei @xcite .",
    "for example , with an harmonic oscillator ( ho ) potential having in addition an infinite soft core , the @xmath8 of @xmath10 can be well reproduced , but for the heavier nuclei , such as @xmath11c and @xmath6o , state dependent potentials seem necessary and even then the fit is not so good for higher q  values @xcite . another way is the introduction of a modified shell model with fractional occupation numbers for the various states @xcite .",
    "an approach , which is rather similar , is the introduction of the short range correlations ( src ) in the slater determinant .",
    "many attempts have been made in this direction , concerning mainly light closed shell nuclei in the framework of the born  approximation .",
    "czyz and lesniak @xcite first showed that the diffraction character of the @xmath12he form factor can be qualitatively explained by means of jastrow  type @xcite correlations .",
    "khana @xcite , using iwamoto ",
    "yamada cluster expansion and retaining only one and two  body cluster terms , showed that the inclusion of short range nucleon ",
    "nucleon correlations provide an adequate description for the known data on the elastic scattering of electrons by @xmath7ca and make predictions for the behavior of the cross section at large momentum transfers .",
    "ciofi degli atti , using the `` single pair approximation '' @xcite and the iwamoto ",
    "yamada cluster expansion @xcite in s ",
    "p shell nuclei , showed that the elastic electron scattering at high momentum transfers seems to give a strong indication of the presence of src in nuclei .",
    "bohigas and stringari @xcite and dal ri et al @xcite evaluated the effect of src on the one and two  body densities by developing a low order approximation ( loa ) in the framework of the jastrow formalism .",
    "they showed that one  body quantities like the form factor provide an adequate test for the presence of src in nuclei , which indicates that the independent  particle wave functions can not reproduce simultaneously the form factor and the momentum distribution of a correlated system .",
    "stoitsov et al @xcite generalized the model of jastrow correlations , suggested by bohigas and stringari @xcite within the loa of ref .",
    "@xcite , to heavier nuclei like @xmath6o , @xmath13ar and @xmath7ca reproducing very well the experimental data .    in the above approaches ,",
    "different types of expansions were used .",
    "the expansions were connected with the number of the simultaneously correlated nucleons , and the order of the jastrow correlation function , @xmath14 , which were retained in the cluster expansion .",
    "usually they are truncated up to the two  body terms which give significant contribution to various expectation values .    in a series of papers @xcite an expression of the elastic charge form factor , @xmath8 , truncated at the two  body term , was derived using the factor cluster expansion of clark et al @xcite .",
    "this expression , which is a sum of one  body and two  body terms , and depends on the ho parameter and the correlation parameter through a jastrow type correlation function , is used for the calculation of @xmath8 of @xmath5he , @xmath6o and @xmath7ca and in an approximate way for the open s ",
    "p and s  d shell nuclei .",
    "the motivation of the present work is the systematic study of the effect of src on the s ",
    "p and s  d shell nuclei by completely avoiding the approximation made in earlier work @xcite for open shell nuclei , that is the expansion of the two  body terms in powers of the correlation parameter , in which only the leading terms had been retained .",
    "general expressions for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 were found using the factor cluster expansion of clark et al and jastrow correlation functions which introduce src .",
    "these expressions are functionals of the sp wave functions and not of the wave functions of the relative motion of two nucleons as was the case in many previous works @xcite .",
    "because of that , it is easy to extrapolate them to the case of open shell nuclei and use them either for analytical calculations with ho wave functions or for numerical calculations when more realistic sp wave functions are used .",
    "an advantage of the present method is that the mass dependence of the ho parameter @xmath1 ( with the presence of correlations ) and the correlation parameter @xmath2 can be studied .",
    "these parameters have been determined , for the various s ",
    "p and s  d shell nuclei by fit of the theoretical @xmath8 to the experimental ones .",
    "it is found that while the parameter @xmath2 is almost constant for the closed shell nuclei , @xmath5he , @xmath6o and @xmath7ca , it takes larger values ( less correlated systems ) in the open shell nuclei , indicating a shell effect for the closed shells .",
    "the present method has also been used with wave functions of skyrme  type interactions . in this case",
    "there is only one free parameter , the correlation parameter @xmath2 and the two body ",
    "term is a small correction to the one body ",

    "we found that while the @xmath162 values become better , comparing to those of case 2 , the third diffraction minimum is not reproduced either and the behavior of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 as functions of the mass number @xmath163 remains the same .",
    "the results in this case are shown in table i and in figure 2 .",
    "the values of the occupation probability @xmath161 of the above mentioned three nuclei are : 0.0355 , 0.0245 and 0.2945 respectively , while the corresponding values of @xmath164 , which can be found from the values of @xmath161 through the relation : @xmath165/10\\ ] ] are : 0.3929 , 0.5951 and 0.7411 respectively .",

    "the contribution of the src to @xmath9 , @xmath166 is shown .",
    "the introduction of short range correlations has the feature of reducing the central part of the densities of the closed shell nuclei , while @xmath167 is small and characterized by oscillations in the case of open shell nuclei .    from the determined mass dependence of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the values of these parameters for other s ",
    "p or s  d shell nuclei can found . in figures 1d and 5d",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the nucleus @xmath13ar , treated as an 1d closed shell nucleus , are shown . as there are no experimental data for @xmath8 for high @xmath168 values , the value of the parameter @xmath2 is taken to be the mean value of the corresponding values of @xmath6o and @xmath7ca , that is : @xmath169 @xmath170 , while the parameter @xmath1 is determined assuming that @xmath171 where @xmath172 using the values of the parameters @xmath173 fm , @xmath174 fm from table i and choosing the parameter @xmath175 fm in order to reproduce the experimental rms charge radius of @xmath13ar ( @xmath176 fm @xcite ) the value @xmath177 fm was found .",
    "these values of @xmath178 and @xmath179 have been used for the calculations of the correlated @xmath8 and @xmath9 of @xmath180ar , which are shown in figures 1d and 5d , respectively . the calculated rms charge radius , @xmath181 fm , which was found , is within the experimental error .",
    "the effect of src on the form factors has also been examined with various skyrme  type wave functions . in this case",
    ", there is only one free parameter , the correlation parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the potential parameters have been adjusted in refs .",
    "@xcite in order to reproduce various physical quantities such as rms radii , binding energies e.t.c .. thus , some effects of the src , we would like to study , have already been averaged out . because of that we can not study the effect of the src on the parameters of the skyrme interactions . this can be done if both the skyrme parameters and the correlation parameter are readjusted by fit to various experimental data including the form factors and the fit is made for many nuclei at the same time . as this is out of the scope of the present work",
    ", we examined the form factors of @xmath6o and @xmath7ca with various skyrme interactions , namely sk1 to sk6 @xcite , without src , named case 3 and with src , named case 4 .    in case 3 and for @xmath6o , only sk1 gives smaller value for @xmath147 compared with that of case 1 ( ho without src ) .",
    "the inclusion of src ( case 4 ) to the skyrme  type wave functions gives better @xmath147 only for the sk1 , but still this value is about 10% larger than in case 2 ( ho with src ) and 1% smaller than in case 3 . for sk2 to sk6",
    "the correlated parameter @xmath2 goes to very large values ( very small correlations ) without improving the quality of the fit . for @xmath7ca and for case 3 all the skyrme interactions , we have examined ,",
    "give almost the same @xmath147 value which is about 20% smaller than in case 1 and 10% larger than that of case 2 , while the inclusion of the correlations improves the quality of the fit , for all the skyrme interactions , not more than 2% .",
    "see table i and figure 1 for the results we have found with sk1 .    from the results with skyrme  type wave functions we could conclude that even if a mean field is more realistic than the ho one , the inclusion of the src does not improve the fit , at least of the @xmath8 , significantly .",
    "significant improvement of the fit should be expected if the parameters of the mean field will be determined along with the correlation parameter .",
    "it should be noted also that , a good fit to the experimental @xmath8 of @xmath182li , @xmath11c and @xmath6o has been found by ciofi degli atti et al @xcite , using woods ",
    "saxon wave functions , only if the correlation parameter and the depths and radii of the wells were free parameters .",
    "in the present work , general expressions for the correlated charge form factors and densities have been found using the factor cluster expansion of clark et al .",
    "these expressions can be used , either for analytical calculations , with ho orbitals or for numerical calculations of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , with more realistic orbitals .",
    "the systematic calculations , with ho orbitals , of these quantities , for a number of n = z , s  p and s  d shell nuclei , show that there is a shell effect on the values of the ho parameter @xmath1 and on the correlation parameter @xmath2 . regarding the parameter @xmath2",
    "it is almost constant for the closed shell nuclei while it takes larger values for the open shell nuclei .",
    "the mass dependence of these parameters indicates that the src are stronger for the closed shell nuclei than for the open shell ones .",
    "this dependence can also be used to find reasonable values of these parameters for nuclei for which there are no experimental data of the @xmath8 .",
    "numerical calculations with various skyrme  type wave functions , taken from the literature @xcite , indicate that even if a mean field is more realistic than the ho one , the introduction of the src does not improve the fit of the charge form factors significantly .",
    "the reason for this should be that the introduction of the correlations makes a change in the mean field in a way that there is a balance between the src and the mean field , while for a given mean field there is not this flexibility . a way to overcome",
    "this difficulty should be to readjust the parameters of the mean field and the parameter of the correlations .",
