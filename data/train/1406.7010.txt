    "over the past ten years , gauge - string duality has found fruitful application in the realm of strongly coupled systems , from low - energy qcd to superconductors .",
    "the connection between string theory and qcd is far older , however .",
    "it dates back to the days of regge theory , when string theories were constructed in order to describe hadronic spectra , and hadronic scattering at high center - of - mass energy @xmath5 and small momentum transfer @xmath6 ( the regge regime ) @xcite . to good approximation",
    ", the masses of mesons and baryons lie on linear trajectories  regge trajectories  with particle spin @xmath7 related to the mass @xmath8 as @xmath9 .",
    "string theories generate precisely such a spectrum .",
    "meanwhile , scattering events at small @xmath6 should be governed by the exchange of hadrons . in the regge regime ,",
    "hadrons of arbitrarily high spin contribute to the process , so the entire regge trajectory should be taken into account .",
    "the mediating hadron can be replaced by a `` reggeon , '' which couples like the lowest state on the exchanged trajectory .",
    "the veneziano amplitude , now known to describe the scattering of strings in flat space , was first proposed as a phenomenological model for the scattering of hadrons in the regge limit .",
    "the old idea of treating reggeons as flat space strings captures many qualitative features , but fails to accurately describe the observed regge trajectories and scattering processes .",
    "it may yet find new life in gauge - string duality , whereby certain gauge theories ( like qcd ) are mapped onto string theories in higher dimensional curved spacetimes .",
    "regge regime hadronic scattering can thus be translated to the holographic dual , where hadronic scattering is quite literally string scattering  but in a curved 5d space .",
    "consider , for example , the behavior of proton - proton or proton - anti - proton scattering in the regge regime .",
    "since the cross - sections behave similarly at very large @xmath5 , the exchanged object should be insensitive to the charges of the scattered ( anti)protons . , the exchange of mesonic trajectories also contributes . ]",
    "the exchanged trajectory thus has vacuum quantum numbers , and is known as the _",
    "pomeron_. the lightest particle on the pomeron trajectory is widely believed to be a @xmath10 glueball .",
    "since the pomeron consists of even spin glueballs , its holographic dual should be a closed string @xcite .",
    "the pomeron was first identified in a holographic context in @xcite as the regge trajectory of string states in an asymptotically anti - de sitter ( aads ) space , whose lowest state is the graviton .",
    "this means that hadron scattering mediated by pomeron exchange should be equivalent to closed string scattering in the holographic dual .",
    "though such amplitudes are difficult to calculate exactly , one can model the interactions of the lowest modes on the regge trajectories in the supergravity limit of gauge - string models , and then extend the results for these lowest - energy states to the regge regime .",
    "although no known holographic dual model perfectly reproduces all relevant features of low - energy qcd , several reasonable toy models exist . the sakai - sugimoto model , for instance ,",
    "consists of @xmath11 d8 and @xmath12 branes in the warped gravitational background generated by @xmath13 d4-branes @xcite ( for large @xmath13 ) . the open strings on the d - branes are dual to mesons , while the closed strings living in the bulk are dual to glueballs . despite some important limitations ,",
    "the masses of mesons and some glueballs computed in this framework have been found to match experimental and lattice results with reasonable accuracy @xcite .",
    "it is interesting and important , then , to extend the results of low - energy holographic duals to modeling the scattering processes of baryons and mesons in the regge limit .",
    "glueball scattering ( in the regge limit and beyond ) was studied in @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite proposed a more phenomenological approach for studying proton-(anti)proton scattering holographically , relying on the assumption that string scattering in weakly curved backgrounds should roughly take the same form as _",
    "flat space _ string scattering .",
    "first , @xcite computed the amplitude for holographic proton - proton scattering via spin 2 glueball exchange from the supergravity limit of the sakai - sugimoto model .",
    "they then used the structure of the flat - space virasoro - shapiro amplitude to model the full pomeron propagator , and substituted this propagator for the glueball propagators in the proton - proton scattering amplitude .",
    "we call this procedurereggeizing \" the amplitude  in other words , extending the low energy result to the regge regime .",
    "the slope and intercept of the pomeron trajectory were left as free parameters in this procedure , as these should differ from their flat space values .",
    "the result of @xcite s procedure was a phenomenological model for high energy scattering which could be directly compared with data .",
    "in this work , we use similar techniques to model the double - pomeron - mediated central production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in regge - regime proton - proton scattering .",
    "we begin by determining the differential cross section for the central production of a pseudoscalar meson via the exchange of spin 2 particles .",
    "this process violates natural parity . in ads",
    "/ qcd , natural parity violating couplings arise from bulk chern - simons terms present in all d - brane constructions which yield qcd in the low - energy limit .",
    "these terms are responsible for reproducing the gravitational ( and chiral ) anomalies of qcd ) . ] . since the coefficients of these terms are fully fixed  from supergravity and field theory  their inclusion in an ads / qcd model",
    "does not increase the number of free parameters , and is furthermore relatively model - independent .",
    "after computing the low energy amplitude , we use the form of a five ( closed ) string amplitude to motivate the `` reggeization '' of the process .",
    "this does not lead to the same prediction as separately reggeizing each glueball propagator , as was done in @xcite .",
    "our treatment is based on an analysis of central production of particles by double pomeron exchange in the string dual @xcite , where it was demonstrated that the behavior of the scattering amplitude depends on the mass of the centrally produced particle .",
    "we will see that the relatively light mass of the pseudoscalar meson we are considering strongly affects how the glueball propagators should be reggeized .",
    "we finish by generating a monte carlo simulation of @xmath14 central production at @xmath2 gev .",
    "we choose this energy to facilitate comparison with the wa-102 experiment @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that double pomeron exchange only accounts for a small part of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in this regime , with significant contributions coming from double reggeon exchange .",
    "however , double pomeron exchange dominates at much higher energies , and there our model , as it stands , should represent a reasonable approximation .",
    "the central ingredients of our construction yield clear experimental signatures to distinguish them from other approaches , thus providing a powerful check of its underlying principles .",
    "first of all , treating the pomeron as a trajectory of even spin glueballs implies a particular class of couplings , which would not be present if the lowest state were a vector - like particle .",
    "the effects of this distinction are apparent in the form of the differential cross sections .",
    "in addition , because the pomeron should be flavor neutral , the pomeron - pomeron - pseudoscalar interaction exclusively involves the flavor singlet pseudoscalar meson , which we will call @xmath15 . the couplings to @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons",
    "are generated using the mixing angle with the flavor singlet . as pions",
    "can only be centrally produced by exchanging two mesonic regge trajectories ( `` reggeons '' ) , the sole production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 becomes a unique signature for double pomeron processes .",
    "furthermore , the coefficient of the bulk gauge - gravity chern - simons term which generates our coupling is uniquely fixed by requiring consistency of the supergravity theory on one side of the duality , and by the gravitational anomaly on the other .",
    "this makes our predictions relatively model - independent , though explicit predictions for the glueball - glueball - meson couplings do require us to choose a particular holographic qcd dual .",
    "finally , the reggeization procedure based on the 5-string amplitude has a clear experimental signature distinct from the naive reggeization of individual graviton propagators .",
    "all of this suggests that comparison to experiment , either by supplementing these calculations with those for double reggeon exchange or by considering experiments run at higher center - of - mass energy , may yield significant new insights .",
    "the body of this work begins in section ii , where we calculate the cross section for central production of @xmath0 or @xmath1 via @xmath6-channel glueball exchange in the regge limit . in section iii",
    "we discuss the 5-string flat space amplitude and describe the reggeization of our differential cross section .",
    "in section iv we compute the necessary low - energy couplings in the sakai sugimoto model . in section v",
    ", we present the results of a monte carlo simulation for our model .",
    "finally , we discuss the results and suggest some future work in section vi . a detailed description of the kinematics and phase space of @xmath16 scattering in the regge limit is provided in the appendix .",
    "in the regge limit , production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in proton - proton scattering is dominated by processes involving the @xmath6-channel exchange of pomerons .",
    "we begin by reviewing the kinematics and phase space of @xmath17 scattering , and the implications of the regge limit for this process .",
    "we then compute the amplitude and cross section for producing @xmath0 or @xmath1 mesons via t - channel double glueball exchange in proton - proton scattering .",
    "because the glueball is flavor neutral , it only couples to the flavor singlet in the pseudoscalar meson nonet .",
    "we therefore use the mixing angle to determine the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath1 production .      consider a @xmath17 central production process : there are two incoming protons with momenta @xmath18 and @xmath19 , two outgoing protons with momenta @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and one outgoing pseudoscalar meson with momentum @xmath22 , shown in figure [ kinematics ] .",
    "the mass - shell conditions ( with a mostly plus metric ) are [ eqn : massshell ] p_1 ^ 2 = p_2 ^ 2 = p_3 ^ 2 = p_4 ^ 2 = -m_p^2 , p_5 ^ 2 = -m_5 ^ 2 , where @xmath23 is the mass of the proton , and @xmath24 is the mass of either the @xmath0 or the @xmath1 particle .",
    "in addition , conservation of four - momentum yields [ eqn : conservation ] p_1 + p_2 = p_3 + p_4 + p_5 . to make calculations more convenient",
    ", we can define five mandelstam variables , s = -(p_1 + p_2)^2 , t_1 = -(p_1 - p_3)^2 , t_2 = -(p_2 - p_4)^2 , s_1 = -(p_3 + p_5)^2 , s_2 = -(p_4 + p_5)^2 .",
    "we will assume the initial protons momenta are equal and opposite , aligned along the @xmath25-axis , so that we can write the five four - momenta as p_1 = ( e , 0 , 0 , p ) , p_2 = ( e , 0 , 0 , -p ) , p_3 = ( e_3 , * q*_3 , p_3z ) , p_4 = ( e_4 , * q*_4 , p_4z ) , p_5 = ( e_5 , * q*_5 , p_5z ) .",
    "there are five independent kinematic variables determining the outgoing particles momenta .",
    "however , the azimuthal symmetry of the initial states ensures that the final states will only depend on four .",
    "we will use @xmath26 and @xmath27 as two of these variables .",
    "a third will be the angle @xmath3 between the transverse portions of momentum for the outgoing protons , defined as _ 3 = ( q_3_3 , q_3_3 ) , _ 4 = ( q_4_4 , q_4_4 ) , _ 34 = _ 4 - _ 3 .",
    "the fourth will be @xmath28 , the difference between the fractions of initial longitudinal momentum carried by the outgoing protons , defined as p_3z = x_1p , p_4z = -x_2p , x_f = x_1 - x_2 . in the regge limit , where the center - of - mass energy is large and the scattering angles of the two protons are small",
    ", we will have @xmath29 ( where @xmath8 could be the mass of any of the particles involved ) .",
    "we also assume that the quantity [ eqn : eta ] = , remains fixed in the regge limit , and of magnitude comparable to @xmath30 or @xmath31 for any of the involved masses ; we have renamed it to avoid confusion with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons . ] . in appendix",
    "a , we analyze the kinematics and phase space in the regge limit .",
    "we find that the phase space is dominated by the region near @xmath32 , and that we can write the total cross section as [ eqn : cross ] ||^2 ( ) d_34 dt_1 dt_2 , where the spin - averaged amplitude squared @xmath33 is evaluated in the regge limit at @xmath32 . in this limit , we also have m_5 ^ 2 - t_1 - t_2 + 2 _ 34 , s_1 s_2 , q_3 , q_4 .",
    "graph1    ( 2,1.3 )      the feynman diagram we need to compute is shown in figure [ feynman ] .",
    "it involves the propagator for the glueball , a massive spin 2 object ( see e.g. @xcite ) : d_(k ) = , with    d_(k ) = ( _ _ + _ _ ) + ( k_k _ _ + k_k _ _ + k_k _ _ + k_k _ _ ) @xmath34\\eta_{\\mu\\rho}\\eta_{\\nu\\sigma } - \\frac{(k^2 + 3m_g^2)}{6m_g^4}\\left(k_{\\mu}k_{\\rho}\\eta_{\\nu\\sigma } + k_{\\nu}k_{\\sigma}\\eta_{\\mu\\rho}\\right ) + \\frac{2k_{\\mu}k_{\\rho}k_{\\nu}k_{\\sigma}}{3m_g^4},\\ ] ] where @xmath35 could be either @xmath36 or @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the mass of the glueball .",
    "we will see that due to the structure of the vertices , only the first term in this expression contributes .",
    "we also need two vertices : a proton - proton - glueball vertex and a glueball - glueball - pseudoscalar vertex .",
    "we assume that the glueball couples primarily to the stress - energy tensor of the protons , as inspired by the idea of tensor meson dominance @xcite . in this case , the proton - proton - glueball vertex can be written as ^ = _ , with @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the form factors @xmath41 are then derived from the energy - momentum tensor , which implies that @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite . in our amplitude , the term proportional to @xmath44 will not contribute : it vanishes when contracted through the glueball propagator with the natural - parity - violating central vertex .",
    "we also drop terms proportional to @xmath45 , as @xmath45 is small and slowly varying near @xmath46 , where the amplitude is largest .",
    "this is supported by calculations in the sakai - sugimoto model , as discussed in @xcite .    meanwhile , the glueball - glueball - pseudoscalar vertex is [ eq : vertex ] v^ = ^k_1k_2 , with k_1 = p_1 - p_3 , k_2 = p_2 - p_4 .",
    "the structures appearing here are the only ones allowed by the symmetries of the strong force : parity and charge conjugation in addition to lorentz symmetry .",
    "note the presence of the natural parity violating epsilon tensor , which on the gravity side of the duality arises from the chern - simons interaction .",
    "we will eventually take the as - yet - arbitrary factors @xmath47 and @xmath48 from the sakai - sugimoto model , along with the coupling constant @xmath49 and the form factor @xmath50 of the proton - proton - glueball vertex .",
    "the full amplitude for central production of pseudoscalars in double glueball exchange processes is thus @xmath51 using the dirac equation along with the structures of the propagator and vertices ( and dropping terms proportional to @xmath45 ) , we can rewrite this as = , with p_1 = , p_2 = .      in order to find the differential cross section , we now compute @xmath33 , averaging over spins for the incoming protons and summing over the spins of the outgoing protons .",
    "we find     @xmath52\\left[g_1(t_1 , t_2)\\eta^{ef } + g_2(t_1 , t_2)k_2^{e}k_{1}^{f}\\right]\\varepsilon^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\\varepsilon^{abcd}k_{1\\gamma}k_{2\\delta}k_{1c}k_{2d}}{(t_1 - m_g^2)^2(t_2 - m_g^2)^2}\\ ] ] @xmath53 @xmath54    the last two kinematic multiplicative terms come from expanding the traces over gamma matrices associated with the proton - proton - glueball vertices . in each one ,",
    "only the first term ( proportional to @xmath55 ) contributes in the regge limit .",
    "this allows for great simplification , leaving us with ||^2= .",
    "combining this result with the expression for the total cross section in equation yields the differential cross section [ eqn : sigma ] = ( ) ^4 ( ) .",
    "perhaps the most interesting aspect of this result is the dependence on the angle @xmath3 .",
    "the factor of @xmath4 arises directly from the contraction with the epsilon tensor , and is therefore a simple consequence of breaking natural parity .",
    "however , there is an additional possible dependence on @xmath3 in the factor @xmath56 , which arises from the vertex structure . at lower energies this process",
    "should be dominated by the double exchange of vector particles , where this additional structure does not occur .",
    "lower energy data , such as that of the wa102 collaboration at @xmath57 , shows no evidence of any angular dependence other than the overall @xmath4 @xcite , which is consistent with the idea that at these energies we expect the exchange of reggeons to play a larger role in the process . at higher energies ,",
    "the amount that the @xmath4 dependence is modified will be determined by the relative values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which we will compute using the sakai - sugimoto model in section iv .    finally , we need to relate this expression to the production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "the glueballs are flavor neutral , and thus should only couple to the flavor singlet pseudoscalar @xmath15 .",
    "this is a linear combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , using the mixing angle @xmath58 : |_0= -|+ |. equation gives the result for production of @xmath15 , and therefore the results for the production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 should be [ exp : sigmaeta ] = ^2()^4 ( ) and [ exp : sigmaetaprime ] = ^2()^4 ( ) .",
    "the overall factor of @xmath59 or @xmath60 is not the only way that the production of @xmath0 differs from the production of @xmath1 : the differing masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons also play a role , as we shall see more clearly once we have properly reggeized the propagators , and computed the factors @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "in the high energy limit we `` reggeize '' the glueball propagators appearing in the differential cross section : we replace them with pomeron propagators .",
    "we use a form motivated by the fact that pomerons are dual to closed strings . in @xcite , the amplitude for 4-string scattering in flat space bosonic string theory",
    "was considered , assuming that the amplitude in the curved space dual to qcd retains the general structure of the flat space amplitude , but with values for parameters such as the trajectory s slope and intercept allowed to vary .",
    "we begin by reviewing that treatment , and then discuss the `` naive '' reggeization of the central production process , assuming we separately reggeize each of the propagators .",
    "we then examine the behavior of the 5-tachyon amplitude in bosonic string theory , as developed in @xcite .",
    "finally , we propose a modification of the naive reggeization procedure motivated by the 5-string amplitude .",
    "this procedure relies crucially on the assumption that the curved space string scattering process involves amplitudes which essentially have the same form as flat - space amplitudes , with the entire effect of space - time curvature and extra dimensions encapsulated in the regge trajectory parameters , which are left arbitrary .",
    "this is clearly an approximation : for instance , it has been shown that long spinning strings receive corrections to their regge trajectories which are not linear in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , for weak spacetime curvatures and scattering processes essentially localized at a single radial position in the holographic space , the assumption should be sufficient to create a reasonable model .",
    "the starting point in analyzing proton - proton scattering in @xcite is the crossing - symmetric virasoro - shapiro amplitude , = 2c  , as given in @xcite .",
    "this is the expression for the scattering of four closed - string tachyons , but it can be modified to account for the external particles having non - zero spin through the inclusion of a kinematic pre - factor with no poles or zeroes .",
    "such a modification has no effect on the procedure of reggeization so we ignore it in what follows .    in bosonic string theory in flat space , we take @xmath61 , so that the mass of the tachyon is @xmath62 .",
    "when we use this as an ansatz for glueball exchange in 4-proton scattering , we assume @xmath63 is a linear function related to the glueball trajectory @xmath64 by [ eqn : traj ] 2 + 2a(x ) = _ c(x ) , so that the lowest element on the trajectory ( corresponding to @xmath65 ) is a spin-2 glueball with mass m_g^2 = . in replacing the dependence on @xmath66 with dependence on @xmath5 and @xmath6 , a mass shell parameter @xmath67",
    "is introduced so that [ eqn : naivechi ] a(s ) + a(t ) + a(u ) = . by then comparing the lowest t - channel pole with the regge limit of this expansion , we obtain the proposed replacement in the regge limit [ eqn : naive ] ( -)^_c(t ) - 2 .",
    "the net effect of what we have done in moving from the bosonic string theory result to the proposed reggeization of the glueball propagator is to introduce the factor @xmath67 ( which in bosonic string theory in flat space would be equal to @xmath68 ) , and replace the bosonic trajectory @xmath61 with the glueball trajectory , according to equation .",
    "this procedure ( and what follows in the analysis of the 5-string amplitude ) has limitations .",
    "however , it has the advantage of maintaining important features such as the crossing symmetry and general regge behavior of the virasoro - shapiro amplitude , while allowing for some phenomenologically motivated adjustments .",
    "the naive reggeization of the @xmath17 scattering process would involve simply replacing the two glueball propagators in our amplitude according to equation .",
    "the result would be    @xmath69 ^ 2 \\left(-\\frac{i\\alpha_c ' s_1}{2}\\right)^{\\alpha_c(t_1 ) - 2}\\left(-\\frac{i\\alpha_c ' s_2}{2}\\right)^{\\alpha_c(t_2 ) - 2 } \\frac{\\gamma\\left[1 - \\frac{\\alpha_c(t_1)}{2}\\right]\\gamma\\left[1 - \\frac{\\alpha_c(t_2)}{2}\\right]}{\\gamma\\left[\\frac{\\alpha_c(t_1)}{2 } - 1 - \\chi\\right]\\gamma\\left[\\frac{\\alpha_c(t_2)}{2 } - 1 - \\chi\\right]}.\\ ] ]    in order to insert this into the differential cross section , we must compute its magnitude squared . at the same time",
    ", we will make the regge limit approximation @xmath70 .",
    "this gives    @xmath71 ^ 4}{s^4}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\alpha_c ' \\mu}\\right)^4\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_c'^2 s\\mu}{4}\\right)^{\\alpha_c(t_1 ) + \\alpha_c(t_2 ) } \\frac{\\gamma\\left[1 - \\frac{\\alpha_c(t_1)}{2}\\right]^2\\gamma\\left[1 - \\frac{\\alpha_c(t_2)}{2}\\right]^2}{\\gamma\\left[\\frac{\\alpha_c(t_1)}{2 } - 1 - \\chi\\right]^2\\gamma\\left[\\frac{\\alpha_c(t_2)}{2 } - 1 - \\chi\\right]^2}.\\ ] ]    it is interesting to note that this expression has a significant dependence on the kinematic parameter @xmath56 .",
    "this would be in addition to the dependence that arises from the structure of the coupling .",
    "phenomenologically , this would complicate an experimental signature associated with the angular ( @xmath3 ) dependence of the scattering cross section",
    ". it would also affect the ratio of the production of @xmath0 to @xmath1 mesons ( through dependence on the mass of the centrally produced meson ) , which would otherwise be governed almost entirely by the mixing angle .",
    "naive reggeization does not take into account the fact that in the dual picture , we should be looking at a 5-string scattering amplitude .",
    "in bosonic string theory in flat space , the five closed string tachyon amplitude can be written = cd^2 u d^2 v |u|^-2a(t_1 ) - 2|v|^-2a(t_2 ) - 2|1 - u|^-2a(s_1 ) - 2|1 - uv|^2a(s_1 ) + 2a(s_2 ) - 2a(s ) - 2 , where @xmath61 is the bosonic closed string regge trajectory ( again ) . unlike the 4-string amplitude , this can not be computed in closed form .",
    "however , it can be approximated in the regge regime in two different limits : @xmath72 large , and @xmath72 small @xcite .",
    "in the former scenario , we obtain 4 ^ 2 c ( -)^2a(t_1)(-)^2a(t_2 ) .",
    "this is essentially just the product of two separate reggeized propagators , which suggests `` naive reggeization . ''",
    "on the other hand , if we assume @xmath72 is small , we obtain -4 ^ 2 c \\{()^2a(t_1)()^2a(t_2 ) @xmath73\\gamma[a(t_2 ) - a(t_1)]}{\\gamma[1 + a(t_1)]\\gamma[1 + a(t_1 ) - a(t_2 ) ] } \\ , \\bigg\\}.\\ ] ]    this expression is somewhat more complicated than the naive result .",
    "the value of @xmath56 , given in equation , is primarily determined by the mass of the centrally produced meson : @xmath74 .",
    "based on fitting to proton - proton scattering in @xcite , we also know @xmath75 .",
    "this gives @xmath76 for central production of the @xmath0 meson , and @xmath77 for central production of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "it is clearly more reasonable to use the approximation that @xmath78 is small , which is not consistent with naive reggeization .",
    "we will therefore use the form of the 5-string amplitude as a guide to create a modified reggeization scheme for the glueball propagators in central production processes .      in analogy to the 4-string procedure , we propose a modified form of the reggeized double glueball propagator in the small @xmath78 limit as ( ) ^2 ^ 2(-)^-2 @xmath79 where we define ( t_1 ,",
    "t_2 ) = . here",
    ", we maintain the same ratio of gamma functions , but we modify the trajectory to be the glueball trajectory .",
    "this creates the correct pole structure .",
    "we also introduce factors of @xmath67 according to their appearance in equation . however , it is not clear what value @xmath67 should assume .",
    "the value found in equation may not be appropriate here : if @xmath67 arises from mass - shell relationships between mandelstam variables , it should surely depend on the mass of the centrally produced meson .",
    "in order to determine the reggeized double propagator formally , we would need to rewrite the original 5-string amplitude in a form where the appropriate crossing symmetries are manifest , and then rewrite the expression in terms of the five independent mandelstam variables @xmath80 , using appropriate mass - shell relations .",
    "nevertheless , changing the value of @xmath67 mostly rescales the reggeized double propagator without significantly affecting its functional form , provided it is negative and of order @xmath81",
    ". we will therefore use the value given in equation when simulating central production in section v.    as before , we now compute the magnitude squared reggeized propagators and insert @xmath70 , as dictated by the regge limit .",
    "this gives    [ eq:5stringreg ] ( ) ^_c(t_1 ) + _ c(t_2 )    @xmath82^{\\alpha_c'(t_2 - t_1)}\\mathcal{w}^2(t_1 , t_2 ) \\",

    "the reggeization suppresses values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 that are significantly nonzero , and so this dependence on @xmath56 is very weak , in contrast with what is implied by naive reggeization .",
    "therefore , using the modified reggeization scheme , we should expect almost all of the @xmath3 dependence to come from the structure of the glueball - glueball - pseudoscalar vertex .",

    ", however , we expect that double pomeron exchange will dominate and that the differential cross section will exhibit modifications from the pure @xmath4 behavior .",
    "let us examine the source of this deviation from @xmath4 behavior .",
    "besides the overall factor of @xmath4 , there are three sources of angular dependence in the differential cross section , all of which arise from the structure @xmath257 .",
    "first , we have the factor of @xmath258 , which comes from the kinematics and phase space of @xmath259 scattering . because @xmath56 is always close to @xmath260 and",

    "however , since @xmath262 , the quantity @xmath261 will also varies quite slowly : at most 10% over the domain of the differential cross section .",
    "finally , we have the expression @xmath263 , which comes from the structure of the spin 2-spin 2-pseudoscalar vertex . this is the dominant factor modifying the @xmath4 dependence .",
    "the ratio @xmath230 controls the degree of this modification , suggesting that the deviation of @xmath254 from @xmath4 could be used ( at higher energies ) as an experimental test both of the even - spin nature of the pomeron trajectory ( which is what allows such a vertex structure to exist in the first place ) , as well as the specific value of @xmath230 .      as discussed previously",
    ", the reggeization scheme based on a 5-string amplitude structure has significantly different implications for the scattering process than a naive reggeization scheme . in order to highlight this",
    ", we can also look at simulations based on the naive reggeization scheme , and for the un - reggeized differential cross section .",

    "we notice immediately that @xmath265 shows only a very weak deviation from the @xmath4 shape , with a maximum just greater than @xmath266 .",

    "this cancellation depends on the precise value of @xmath268 . if we instead look at @xmath1 production , shown in figure [ fig : etaprime_naive ] , this cancellation effect is less exact due to the increased value of @xmath24 , and the maximum shifts to below @xmath266",

    "the ratio of the naively reggeized @xmath0 and @xmath1 total cross sections is approximately @xmath282 , due to the additional dependence on @xmath24 in this calculation .",
    "it is also interesting to compare these cross sections to the experimental cross sections from the wa102 experiment @xcite , which found @xmath283 at @xmath284 gev .",
    "it would thus appear that double pomeron exchange accounts for only about @xmath285 of the production of @xmath1 , and less than @xmath286 of the production of @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the overall cross sections calculated are sensitive to a number of factors that we have estimated only very roughly .",
    "in particular , varying the mass - shell parameter @xmath67 by @xmath287 changes the cross sections by an order of magnitude .",
    "however , this sensitivity is not carried over into either the dependence on @xmath3 or the ratio of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 total cross sections .",
    "furthermore , such a strong hierarchy is not surprising from the holographic perspective : the coefficient of the 5d gravitational chern - simons term that gives rise the pomeron - pomeron-@xmath15 interaction is determined by the anomaly to be @xmath288 , while the pure gauge chern - simons term that generates the reggeon - reggeon-@xmath0 vertex has a coefficient of @xmath289 . without taking into account the reduction to a 4d effective theory ,",
    "whose couplings are determined in part by these coefficients , in part by wavefunction overlaps ( as described in the previous section ) , the hierarchy of chern - simons coefficients implies that the cross sections differ by a factor of roughly 2500 !",
    "the dependence on @xmath5 , meanwhile , favors pomeron exchange as @xmath5 grows larger , since reggeized pomeron propagators scale ( roughly ) with @xmath290 while reggeons scale with @xmath291 , leading to naively reggeized central production cross sections that approximately go like @xmath292 and @xmath293 , respectively .",
    "it is thus clear that while understanding reggeon exchange is essential at presently - measured energies , at high enough energies pomeron exchange should play the dominant role .",
    "we have used the ideas of holographic qcd and regge theory to construct a model for the central production of a pseudoscalar meson via double pomeron exchange in proton - proton collisions .",
    "our starting point was the tree - level process involving the t - channel exchange of massive spin-2 particles , where the forms of the vertices and propagators are dictated by lorentz , parity and charge conjugation symmetry .",
    "the central vertex , in particular , must violate natural parity , which leads to an overall factor of @xmath4 in the cross section , where @xmath3 is the angle between the emerging photons in the plane transverse to the scattering process .",
    "assuming that the exchanged particles are spin 2 leads to additional possible structures ( and additional dependence on @xmath3 ) , that are not present if for instance the exchanged particle is spin 1 .",
    "motivated by gauge - string duality , we considered this process to be the low - energy limit of a 5-string scattering process , and sought to find an appropriate `` reggeization . ''",
    "it was previously shown that in elastic proton - proton scattering , the regge limit of the string amplitude is reasonably approximated by simply replacing low - energy propagators with a reggeized propagator that encompasses the entire exchanged regge trajectory , in this case a pomeron .",
    "we found that a naive approach based on this idea , separately replacing each propagator with a pomeron , is not equivalent to what follows from analyzing a 5-string amplitude in the regge limit , unless the mass of the centrally produced meson is sufficiently large .",
    "this should not be the case for the @xmath0 or @xmath1 mesons .",
    "we therefore proposed a modified reggeization procedure for this scattering process .",
    "this form of reggeization , in particular , does not introduce significant additional dependence on the angle @xmath3 into the scattering cross section ( while the naive reggeization process would ) .",
    "we then computed the low energy coupling constants using the sakai - sugimoto model as the supergravity limit of the dual theory .",
    "here , the natural - parity - violating central vertex arises from a chern - simons action which reproduces the gravitational anomaly in qcd .",
    "the values of the two coupling constants involved were computed as overlap integrals depending on the modes of the graviton in the bulk and the vector field on the d8-brane .",
    "the chern - simons action leads to a vertex structure that includes more information than can be inferred using symmetry arguments alone .",
    "this information is likely to be relatively model independent ; any qcd dual theory must contain parity violating chern - simons terms that reflect the chiral gravitational anomaly of qcd .",
    "these five - dimensional chern - simons couplings are universal , although some weak model dependence enters through the wave functions of the glueballs and @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .    finally , we generated simulations of the scattering process at the energy @xmath2 gev , using our reggeization procedure for the propagators and the values of the coupling constants derived from the sakai - sugimoto model .",
    "we saw a clear shift of the differential cross section @xmath254 away from a pure @xmath4 profile .",
    "experimental data at this energy shows no such deviation , supporting the idea that at this energy double reggeon exchange dominates the process .",
    "we also computed the total cross sections for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 production . using our reggeization procedure",
    ", we found that the ratio is primarily determined by the mixing angle between @xmath0 and @xmath1 : the glueballs couple only to the flavor singlet .",
    "given that the existing central production data ( e.g. from the wa102 @xcite experiment ) lies squarely in the regime where reggeon exchange seems to dominate , a crucial next step in this analysis is to create a model that also incorporates double reggeon exchange .",
    "it will be an important zeroth - order check of our methods to see whether holographic calculations which include reggeons give the right ballpark estimate for the total cross section .",
    "since double reggeon process should dominate at this energy , the dependence of the differential cross section on @xmath3 should be a simple @xmath4 profile dependence from reggeization are unlikely ; the amplitude in the small @xmath56/regge limit has only weak dependence on @xmath56 , just as for the 5-closed - string amplitude . ]",
    ". it would be interesting to analyze the behavior of the full model at increasing center - of - mass energy so as to pinpoint where significant deviations from @xmath4 begin to arise .",
    "the present analysis could also be made more consistent .",
    "the reggeization of propagators was somewhat ad hoc : we used the 5-string scattering amplitude for flat space bosonic strings as a starting point , but did not take into account the modifications of the mass - shell conditions in a well - motivated way",
    ". it would be interesting to take a more systematic approach , particularly as this might lead to additional dependence on the mass of the centrally produced meson .",
    "we could also use a more accurate treatment of the proton in the dual model that better accounts for the 5d structure of the process instead of simply relying on the skyrmion solution for both the form factor and the coupling constant between the protons and the glueballs .",
    "however , the recent numerical work of @xcite on exact skyrmion solutions suggests that this may not be a reasonable approach",
    ". a numerical analysis to determine these factors would be more appropriate , and might yield further insights .",
    "overall , our results suggest that the central production of pseudoscalar mesons in very high energy proton - proton collisions could provide interesting insights into the success of string / gravity duals for qcd .",
    "though the details of the production rate are model - dependent , the central ingredient  a natural parity - violating coupling between glueballs and pseudoscalar mesons required by the gravitational contribution to the chiral anomaly  is not .",

    "note that so far we have made no use of the regge limit",
    ". we should also remember that we eventually want to work with the process in terms of @xmath303 , which means we want to rewrite the integrals over @xmath304 and @xmath305 as integrals over @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "however , it will be much easier to understand how to do this once we work out the regge limit .",

    "we want to have @xmath306 , where @xmath8 is any of the masses involved , and @xmath307 is held fixed in the limit .",
    "this implies that in the regge limit we have s x_f s_1 - s_2 .",
    "we can then rewrite @xmath308 and @xmath309 in terms of @xmath56 and @xmath310 , as s_1 , s_2 . using these expressions then gives us e_5 =",
    "the appearance of @xmath311 in the phase space integral then implies that in the extreme regge limit @xmath312 there is a pole at @xmath32 , but for any finite @xmath5 there is just a sharp peak , with @xmath313 at @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , we should have q_3 ^ 2 -(2 + x_f - ) - ( x_f - ) ^2 and similarly q_4 ^ 2 -(2 - x_f - ) - ( x_f + ) ^2 .",
    "now , in performing the variable transformation necessary to rewrite the integrals over @xmath304 and @xmath305 in terms of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , we should note that @xmath56 will depend on @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "however , to leading order in the regge limit , we will get d(q_3 ^ 2 ) d(q_4 ^ 2 ) dt_1 dt_2 dt_1 dt_2 .",
    "we also have e_3 = , e_4 = , and this implies that |e_3 p_4z - e_4 p_3z| .",
    "this then demonstrates that in the regge limit we simply have dt_1 dt_2 .",
    "( notice that there is neither a formal pole nor a sharp peak at @xmath314 . )",
    "this allows us to write our total cross section as dx_f d_34 dt_1 dt_2 . finally ,",
    "since the phase space is sharply peaked in the far regge limit around @xmath32 , we can approximate this further by replacing @xmath33 with its value at @xmath32 , and evaluating the integral over @xmath28 explicitly .",
    "this gives _",

    "note first that we will now have s_1 s_2 , q_3 , q_4 .",

    "<S> we construct a string - inspired model for the central production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in proton - proton collisions via double pomeron exchange . using general symmetry considerations </S>",
    "<S> , we construct a low - energy differential cross section for double glueball exchange in terms of some undetermined coupling constants and form factors . </S>",
    "<S> we extend this model to the regge regime , replacing the glueball propagators with pomeron trajectories , and modifying the interaction term by a factor derived from the 5-string scattering amplitude in flat space . </S>",
    "<S> we then fix the couplings which remain undetermined , using the sakai - sugimoto framework to model low - energy qcd . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we generate a simulation of the scattering process at @xmath2 gev , where double pomeron exchange should play a role ( secondary to double reggeon exchange ) . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the dependence of the scattering cross section on @xmath3 , the angle between the scattered protons in the transverse plane . </S>",
    "<S> the results exhibit a definite deviation from the pure @xmath4 dependence that arises as a consequence of natural parity violation alone . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of deviation is primarily determined by couplings that come from the chern - simons action of the ads / qcd supergravity dual , which is directly related to the qcd gravitational anomaly , and thus constitutes a universal part of any five - dimensional string / gravity dual theory of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this makes the high energy central production of pseudoscalar mesons an interesting probe of ads / qcd models . </S>"
