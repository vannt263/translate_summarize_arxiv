    "time - resolved pump / probe experiments have seen a rebirth in recent years as timescales have been pushed well into the femtosecond ( and sometimes attosecond ) range , and as many different types of experiments can now be performed in an ultrafast pump / probe format .",
    "much of the experimental work , ranging from ultrafast optical studies to angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) have been centered on examining the behavior of charge density wave materials  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will review work on theoretical descriptions of pump / probe time - resolved photoemission spectroscopy on charge - density - wave ( cdw ) materials .",
    "because this is a short review , we will focus entirely on our work , which describes many of the experimental features seen in recent studies .",
    "pump / probe photoemission experiments really came to life when it was recognized that one could period quadruple a 1.5  ev light pulse to create 6  ev pulses that also are ultrashort ( typical widths are in the few 10s of femtoseconds ) .",
    "the higher - energy pulses are sufficient to photoemit electrons from part of the brillouin zone ( bz ) in materials with small workfunctions . the experimental apparatus for this",
    "was then applied to a wealth of different materials , with a large focus on cdw systems like tas@xmath0 , tise@xmath0 and tbte@xmath1 .",
    "these materials have complex ground states , and often have a number of different competing phases that can be accessed by changing temperature or pressure .",
    "tas@xmath0 was the first material studied  @xcite .",
    "in the 1 t phase , this material goes through a range of different phase transitions , starting with an incommensurate cdw at high temperature , passing to a nearly commensurate cdw , and then a commensurate one , which has a three - sublattice ordering in the form of planar star - of - davids .",
    "this lowest temperature commensurate cdw is predicted to be a metal in density functional theory calculations , but is seen to be an insulator in transport measurements ( and other probes ) .",
    "it has long been believed that the insulator arises from a mott transition in the band at the fermi energy  @xcite , but recent work has called this interpretation into question  @xcite , as it is becoming clearer that the stacking of the orbital ordering along the c - axis also plays an important role , and could even be the origin of the insulating behavior .",
    "the time - resolved arpes studies showed that the system has its gap collapse when it is driven and it also saw an interesting subgap resonance as the system relaxed back to equilibrium . an ultrafast core - level x - ray photoemission spectroscopy study measured the charge modulation order parameter of the material  @xcite and found that it decreases , and then relaxes back , but never goes all the way to zero , even though the gap has collapsed .",
    "more recently , it has been found that the system can relax to a metastable metallic nonequilibrium state  @xcite that appears to be similar in many respects to the nearly commensurate cdw but with some clear differences .",
    "electron diffraction studies found yet another nonequilibrium metastable phase  @xcite .",
    "other materials have also been studied .",
    "tbte@xmath1 is another interesting material which has been examined with time resolved arpes  @xcite . here",
    "one can watch the closing and re - opening of the gap directly in momentum space .",
    "in addition to seeing this behavior , two new results have emerged  first , the photoemission rings at a frequency given by the ordering phonon in the system and second , the spectral gap can be reduced , but not all the way to zero , even if there is a high fluence and there are significant subgap states which have closed the gap .",
    "the persistence of this spectral gap feature is something that naturally emerges in nesting - based cdws as we describe below .",
    "finally , tise@xmath0 has been thoroughly studied  @xcite .",
    "this material is believed to be an excitonic insulator , which should respond fast to a pump because the ordering is electronic in nature and does not require phonons .",
    "indeed , the response time is seen to be quite fast in this system ( under 50 femtoseconds ) , and a recent theory has been developed to describe the experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that there is much more work needed to fully understand the behavior of these materials .",
    "many - body theory has also seen a significant development in recent years .",
    "dynamical mean - field theory  @xcite ( dmft ) has emerged as one of the most useful methods for describing electron correlations in three - d materials .",
    "its extension to nonequilibrium  @xcite , enables a wide range of different many - body problems to be solved .",
    "the theory can work both in the normal state and in commensurate ordered phases , and recently , there has been a range of work on the nonequilbrum properties of cdws .",
    "this started with the exact solution of a simplified bandstructure model , where a range of different phenomena were studied : ( i ) pump / probe photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite ; ( ii ) high - harmonic generation of light  @xcite ; ( iii ) response to a large dc current and bloch oscillations  @xcite ; and ( iv ) how quantum systems are excited as functions of the pump amplitude and frequency  @xcite .",
    "since then , this approach has been expanded to examine the behavior of nesting - driven electronic cdws as described by the falicov - kimball model  @xcite and also being solved exactly  @xcite . here , the bloch oscillations in response to a large dc field , and the time - resolved photoemission spectroscopy were both studied .",
    "the cdw phase of the falicov - kimball model is quite interesting , because it displays an additional tricritical quantum - critical point , which is unique in that the order parameter is not suppressed to zero at the critical point ",
    "instead , the system transforms from an insulator to a metal  @xcite .",
    "we describe this unique phenomena in detail here .",
    "this review is not intended to be an exhaustive review of the subject , instead , its intent is to carefully derive the needed formalism to solve these problems , explain how one controls the numerics to implement the solutions , and then discusses the properties of those solutions .",
    "our focus has been entirely on our work , which represents nearly all of the work on these systems within the nonequilibrium dmft approach .",
    "finally , we discuss how one can relate the results of the theory to experiment , and determine the origin of some of the features seen in these experiments .",
    "most cdw order is complex in real materials and does not simply follow the peierls paradigm of an ab ordered phase  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the simplest case of an ab ordered phase provides a rich playground to examine the generic properties of many cdw systems  @xcite .",
    "it also is the easiest problem to solve , and hence we focus all of our efforts in this work to understanding the properties of such an ordered system .",
    "we envision the lattice @xmath2 having @xmath3 sites and being bipartite , which means it consists of two disjoint sublattices : the a sublattice and the b sublattice , which are each connected by the hopping matrix @xmath4 .",
    "the hopping only connects between sites in different sublattices and for standard systems like a simple - cubic lattice , or a square lattice , the ordering wavevector is @xmath5 , in which @xmath6 is the lattice spacing ; we work in units where @xmath7 here .",
    "this allows us to express the formalism in two representative ways  in real space or in momentum space .",
    "due to the ordering , the translational symmetry is reduced in real space , requiring a lattice with a basis , while in momentum space , we have a coupling between momentum @xmath8 and @xmath9 for all momenta in the reduced brillouin zone , which is half the size of the original bz .",
    "the ordering wavevector satisfies @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the position vector of the @xmath12th lattice site .",
    "note that the bandstructure for a periodic lattice , where @xmath4 depends only on @xmath13 , can be expressed as @xmath14    the hamiltonian will be written in terms of spinless fermionic creation @xmath15 and annihilation @xmath16 operators for conduction electrons at site @xmath12 on the lattice .",
    "these operators satisfy the conventional anticommutation relations @xmath17 and can be transformed to momentum space via @xmath18 in the ordered phase , the reduced brillouin zone ( rbz ) is defined via @xmath19 when there is only nearest - neighbor hopping and @xmath20 is restricted to the rbz .",
    "every momentum @xmath20 is then coupled to the momentum @xmath21 which lies in the original bz , but outside the rbz .    in momentum space ,",
    "the two fermionic operators are denoted @xmath22 and @xmath23 , whereas , for the sublattice basis , we restrict the momentum summations to the respective sublattices , as follows : @xmath24 where the @xmath25 is required so that these fermionic operators satisfy the conventional anticommutation relations . with this notation , we then find that @xmath26 as we work on the development of the many - body formalism for pump / probe experiments on cdw systems , we will find it convenient to use both of these different bases to represent the fermionic creation and annihilation operators . converting between",
    "the two is simple , with the unitary transformation that relates them satisfying @xmath27    we will be working with an all electronic model of the cdw , which can be described by the falicov - kimball model ( or a specific , noninteracting limit of the model described below )  @xcite , which has conduction electrons , denoted with a @xmath28 and localized electrons , denoted by an @xmath29 , which mutually interact .",
    "the hamiltonian in an external electric field is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the localized electron number operator ( which can be treated as a classical ising - like variable ) , @xmath32 is the conduction electron chemical potential , @xmath33 is the @xmath29-electron site energy and @xmath34 is the on - site coulomb repulsion .    in the limit @xmath35 , and in the case of half - filling , where the density of conduction electrons and the density of localized electrons is each 0.5 , we find that the equilibrium solution has @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "the simplest model for a cdw fixes @xmath40 at those exact values for all @xmath41 . for the simplified model",
    ", the system always has cdw order , and it can be solved by diagonalizing a bandstructure on a lattice with a basis ( although the dynamics are still complex in nonequilibrium ) . while in the falicov - kimball model , the asymmetry between the two sublattices decreases as the temperature increases until we reach @xmath42 , where the density of both particles becomes uniformly distributed , on average , throughout the entire lattice . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) , the hopping matrix is time - dependent to model an electric field via the peierls substitution  @xcite @xmath43 with the spatially uniform , but time - dependent electric field given by the negative of the time derivative of the spatially uniform vector potential : @xmath44 . in eq .",

    "in other words , we will be working on the infinite - dimensional hypercubic lattice .",
    "we re - express the kinetic - energy operator in terms of the bandstructure in eq .",

    "the inverse is with respect to both the time indices and the @xmath54 structure imposed by the ordered phase .",
    "note that the green s functions and the self - energy are continuous matrix operators .",
    "hence , they can not be easily evaluated numerically .",
    "to do so , requires one to discretize the contour and approximate the operators by finite matrices , which can then be inverted using standard linear algebra methods .",
    "the discretization is then extrapolated to zero to produce the approximation to the continuous matrix operator .",
    "details for how to do this can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we are often interested in local quantities , such as the local green s function , which is found by summing the momentum - dependent green s function over all momentum in the rbz . in many cases",
    ", it is more convenient to perform the summation over the entire bz , since each term appears twice in the summation and one does not need to trace over the final @xmath54 structure .",
    "the difference is whether one sums over @xmath86 terms that are larger than zero .",
    "if restricting to the rbz , then we must weight the @xmath87 terms by 0.5 , otherwise , those boundary terms will be over counted .",
    "of course , because the self - energy is independent of momentum , the sum over momentum can be replaced by a two - dimensional integral over the joint density of states for @xmath86 and @xmath53 . in the @xmath48 limit",
    ", we find that the joint density of states is a double gaussian given by  @xcite @xmath88 if restricting to the rbz , then one needs to reweight the joint density of states , and in some cases perform a trace over the final @xmath54 matrix .",
    "but , by convention , we often weight the green s functions so that the many - body density of states on the a sublattice and the b sublattice each have spectral weight of 1 . in that case , one averages over both to get the _ average _ local density of states .",
    "the simplified cdw case is determined more easily than the full interacting case .",
    "the self - energy simplifies to @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "then , the evolution operator becomes block - diagonal for each momentum ( or , equivalently for each @xmath86 , @xmath53 pair ) , which is described by a simple @xmath54 landau - zener - like system .",
    "the full evolution operator is found by using the trotter formula for a given discretization @xmath91 and can be analytically found to satisfy @xmath92",

    "the full evolution operator for this @xmath54 block then becomes @xmath96 and then this is repeated for each momentum point .",
    "it turns out that the green s function for the simplified cdw model is determined entirely in terms of this evolution operator .",
    "namely , we find that the retarded green s function in the 1,2 momentum representation is determined by just evolution operators between times @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( because the quantum states just depend on the instantaneous value of the hamiltonian ) via @xmath97 if we sum over momentum and convert to the @xmath80 representation , we find that @xmath98 , \\ ] ] with the @xmath99 sign for the @xmath100 sublattice and the @xmath101 sign for the @xmath102 sublattice ; these green s functions are normalized so that @xmath103 .",
    "note that the sum over momentum is replaced by a double integral over the two band energies weighted by the joint density of states .",
    "the lesser green s functions are more complicated , because they depend on all times , not just the times between @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this is reasonable , because how the states are occupied depends on the history of how the occupancy has evolved over time .",
    "the final expression depends on the initial occupancies of the electrons .",
    "these are given by the following @xmath104 here , we use the following notation @xmath105 . the final result for the lesser green s function in the 1,2 representation is cumbersome and is given by @xmath106,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath107,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath108,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath109.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the shortened symbol @xmath110 is employed in these equations . while the transformation to the @xmath80 representation is straightforward , the resulting equations are so long , that we do not write them down here .",
    "however , it is important to calculate the order parameter of the conduction electrons , for both the falicov - kimball model and the simplified model .",
    "it is given by @xmath111}=-\\frac{\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\in { \\rm rbz}}\\left [ g^<_{12}(\\mathbf{k},t , t)+g^<_{21}(\\mathbf{k},t , t)\\right ] } { 2\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\in { \\rm rbz}}\\left [ g_{11}^<(\\mathbf{k},t , t)+g_{22}^<(\\mathbf{k},t , t)\\right ] } , \\ ] ] which is bounded between 0 and 0.5 in equilibrium ( but can become negative in nonequilibrium ) .",
    "similarly , the order parameter of the localized electrons is @xmath112 which is fixed at 0.5 for the simplified model , and reaches 0.5 at @xmath113 for the falicov - kimball model .",
    "it is always nonegative , because it is fixed at its equilibrium value , and hence also has no time dependence .",
    "while we have provided a complete solution of the simplified model , we have not yet described how one solves the dmft for the cdw state in nonequilibrium .",
    "it is solved via an iterative algorithm , but we must work with matrices that have time discretized on the contour .",
    "the algorithm starts with a guess for the self - energies on the two sublattices ( in the @xmath80 representation , the self - energy is diagonal in the @xmath114 space ) .",
    "the iterative approach is then as follows : ( 1 ) for the given self - energies , compute the local green s function @xmath115 by summing dyson s equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyson ] ) over all momenta ( practically speaking , we use an integration over the joint density of states to do this and we do so in the @xmath80 representation ) ; ( 2 ) extract the effective medium @xmath116 from the local dyson s equation ( which has an additional @xmath54 matrix structure in the @xmath80 representation ) : @xmath117 ( 3 ) construct the ( diagonal ) impurity green s function from the diagonal components of the effective medium via @xmath118(t , t'),\\ ] ] with @xmath119 or @xmath102 and @xmath120 with @xmath121 or @xmath102 ; ( 4 ) extract the self - energy for the impurity by solving @xmath122 ( 5 ) and finally setting the new self - energy for the lattice to equal that of the impurity and then iterates steps ( 1)(4 ) until it is converged",
    ".    one of the important checks is the short time behavior of the green s function .",
    "it turns out that by carefully examining the definition of the green s function , one can find the coefficients of the taylor series expansion in relative time .",
    "in particular , for the retarded green s function , when @xmath123 ( or @xmath124 ) , we immediately know that @xmath125 , because the anticommutator of two fermionic operators is equal to one ; this holds both in momentum space and in real space .",
    "higher derivatives can be evaluated by taking commutators with the hamiltonian . remarkably , the first few derivatives do not depend on the field , so they hold in equilibrium and in nonequilibrium .",
    "these results are also called moment sum rules , because that is what they look like when one converts the relative time to a frequency via fourier transformation .",
    "since the first few moment sum rules ( or equivalently relative time derivatives ) of the green s function can be found exactly , they become an important tool in testing the accuracy of calculations  @xcite . for the simplified cdw model",
    ", one can evaluate a taylor series expansion of the time evolution operator and immediately find that the expressions given above satisfy the appropriate sum rules  @xcite .",
    "for the falicov - kimball model , we calculate the moment sum rules by numerically evaluating the first few derivatives of the retarded green s functions .",
    "they serve as important numerical consistency checks of the approach , and are critical to ensure accuracy of the final results .",
    "the derivation of these sum rules is straightforward , but tedious .",
    "while one can do this both for the momentum - dependent green s functions and the local green s functions , we report them only for the local green s functions here . the standard way to report them is in terms of the many - body density of states for each sublattice , which is defined to be @xmath126 , with @xmath127 . here , the average time is @xmath128 and the relative time is @xmath129 .",
    "the moments then satisfy @xmath130 which become @xmath131 @xmath132 and @xmath133 the expectation value @xmath134 measures the average density of the heavy particles on each sublattice ; this expectation value does not change with time .",
    "when calculating momentum - dependent quantities , like the angle - resolved pes , one must be careful to work with gauge - invariant quantities to ensure that the object being measured is a true observable . in this work , we will focus on the angle - summed pes , or total pes , which , being a local quantity , is manifestly gauge invariant .",
    "hence , we do not discuss gauge - invariance issues further here .",
    "in addition , we work with a constant matrix element approximation . for a single band model in the normal state , a constant matrix element simply factors out of the pes expressions .",
    "but when the system has multiple bands , so that the green s function is represented by a matrix ( here a @xmath54 matrix structure for the @xmath100 , @xmath102 sublattices ) , then the matrix elements can not be constant in all different bases  they are constant in one basis , then they are related by a unitary transformation in another basis . while it is tempting to ignore this fact , and approximate the pes signal by the trace of the matrix green s function ( since it is an invariant ) multiplied by a constant , this only holds in the basis where the green s function matrix is diagonal ; the photoemission spectra may not satisfy positivity in this case .",
    "otherwise , the pes ( and especially the angle - resolved pes ) can involve more complex contributions .",
    "here we take the simplifying assumption that the pes is given by a constant matrix element multiplied by the sum of the local diagonal contributions in the @xmath100 , @xmath102 representation . the averaging over the two sublattices",
    "is required because the probe pulse will uniformly irradiate both sublattices .",

    "<S> in this review , we develop the formalism employed to describe charge - density - wave insulators in pump / probe experiments using ultra short driving pulses of light . the theory emphasizes exact results in the simplest model for a charge - density wave insulator ( given by a noninteracting systems with two bands and a gap ) and by employing nonequilibrium dynamical mean - field theory to solve the falicov - kimball model in its ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> we show both how to develop the formalism and how the solutions behave . </S>",
    "<S> care is taken to describe the details behind these calculations and to show how to verify their accuracy via sum - rule constraints .    </S>",
    "<S> _ keywords _ : pump / probe experiment , charge - density - wave insulator , time - resolved photoemission spectroscopy , nonequilibrium dynamical mean - field theory </S>"
