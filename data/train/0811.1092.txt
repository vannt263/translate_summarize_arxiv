    "continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum information processing @xcite has been considered as a promising alternative to discrete variable quantum information processing .",
    "particularly quantum optics offers well - established tools for cv quantum information processing , that is , linear optics , squeezed states and homodyne detections . while discrete variable ( qubit ) quantum information processing depends on a single photon detector which has a limited efficiency , in cv quantum information we can achieve homodyne detections with almost unit - efficiency .",
    "furthermore there recently have been great steps to improve the squeezing level , up to -9db at 860 nm @xcite and -10db at 1064 nm @xcite which show great potentials of cv quantum information processing with squeezed states .    in quantum optical setting , an electromagnetic field mode",
    "is represented by an annihilation operator @xmath0 with real and imaginary parts @xmath1 and @xmath2 corresponding to the position and momentum quadrature - phase amplitude operators .",
    "these operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 satisfy the commutation relation @xmath3 = i \\hbar $ ] ( we set @xmath4 ) .",
    "cv quantum information processing is achieved by a unitary operation @xmath5 upon these variables @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "note that a unitary operation @xmath8 is also called a _",
    "quantum gate _ in the context of quantum information processing , and here @xmath9 is the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "universal quantum computation is realized by an arbitrary unitary operation .",
    "hence one of our goals will be the implementation of an arbitrary unitary operation .",
    "lloyd and braunstein demonstrated that an arbitrary hamiltonian is constructed with arbitrary quadratic hamiltonians and another hamiltonian which has third or higher order @xcite .",
    "their proposal is based on a simple formula @xmath10 \\delta t^2 } + o(\\delta t^3)$ ] ( if we have two hamiltonians @xmath11 and @xmath12 , we can construct hamiltonian @xmath13 $ ] . ) . here",
    "quadratic hamiltonians correspond to gaussian operations , namely , displacement @xmath14 , phase shift @xmath15 , squeezing @xmath16 , and beam splitter @xmath17 .",
    "these gaussian operations can be efficiently performed with linear optics and squeezers .",
    "therefore we need to realize arbitrary gaussian operations and one of non - gaussian operations for universal quantum computation .    in order to construct fault - tolerant quantum gates we can exploit quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "although quantum teleportation was first proposed in the context of quantum communication @xcite , it is also used as a building block in quantum computation .",
    "quantum teleportation is characterized by an ancilla state preparation and measurement - and - feedforward .",
    "it is known that by modifying the entangled resource of teleportation , some quantum gates could be implemented ( off - line scheme ) @xcite . moreover , by choosing appropriate measurement - and - feedforwards with a fixed entangled resource ( cluster state ) we can realize universal one - way quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the teleportation - based computations are illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . figure 1 ( a ) shows a generalized teleportation circuit @xcite .",
    "a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) gate , which is a cv analog of a cnot gate , is realized with a hamiltonian @xmath18 .",
    "off - line scheme ( ancilla state preparation ) is shown in fig . 1 ( b ) .",
    "in this case , first we apply a gate @xmath8 to the teleportation output , and then move the gate @xmath8 before the qnd gate .",
    "note that , in general , @xmath8 does nt commute with a displacement gate and a qnd gate .",
    "but some important gate , e.g. , a cubic phase gate @xmath19 @xcite commutes with a qnd gate @xmath20 .",
    "moreover the displacement @xmath21 can be replaced by @xmath22 which consists of squeezing and displacement @xcite",
    ". hence a cubic phase gate , which will be one of universal gate sets , can be constructed with gaussian operations and a cubic phase state which can be fault tolerantly prepared .",
    "furthermore off - line scheme is useful not only for non - gaussian gate constructions but also for gaussian gate constructions .",
    "for example , we can construct a squeezing gate by using off - line scheme @xcite .",
    "although this scheme is not exactly the same as the teleportation - based scheme described above , it is essentially same . in order to construct the squeezing gate",
    ", we use a transmittance - variable beam splitter and an ancillary squeezed vacuum state instead of a qnd gate and the ancilla state @xmath23 in fig.1 ( b ) . in this scheme",
    ", we can avoid to apply direct nonlinear process which is often lossy and experimentally difficult to control .",
    "moreover we can control the squeezing parameter by varying transmittance of the beam splitter .",
    "this controllability of squeezing leads to construction of some other gates which consist of squeezing gates and beam splitters , e.g. , a qnd gate @xcite .",
    "although a qnd gate is often difficult to realize experimentally , realization of a qnd gate would be desirable for the potential applications .",
    "another teleportation - based computation ( one - way computation ) in fig . 1 ( c ) is also easily understood . in this case , first we apply a gate @xmath8 to the input , and then move the gate in front of the measurement .",
    "again we consider some unitary gate which commutes with a qnd gate .",
    "then the unitary gate can be replaced by a generalized measurement @xmath24 .",
    "hence by applying a sequence of generalized teleportation with the generalized measurements @xmath25 , we can realized @xmath26 . in this scheme",
    ", we only need to change measurement bases .",
    "because the ancilla state is fixed through operations , we can prepare all the ancilla states in advance , that is a cluster state @xcite , before computation . in one - way computation ,",
    "universality is fulfilled by applying non - gaussian measurements .    in this report , we present high - fidelity teleportation experiments and some examples of the teleportation - based computation , namely , a qnd gate and generation of a cluster state .",
    "in cv teleportation @xcite we exploit entanglement which can be generated by combining two squeezed vacua on a half beam splitter . because of the finite level of squeezing , entanglement has always finite correlation , which leads to imperfect teleportation . in order to realize the teleportation - based cv computation , it is of great importance to improve the performance of teleportation which is often evaluated with fidelity @xmath27 .",
    "here @xmath28 is an input state and @xmath29 is a density operator for the teleported state . since the first realization of teleportation ( @xmath30 @xcite )",
    ", fidelity has been improved @xcite .",
    "thanks to the recent improvement of squeezing ( -9db at laser wavelength 860 nm @xcite ) , we obtained fidelity 0.83 for teleportation of a coherent state @xcite .",
    "fidelity 0.83 corresponds to capability of five sequential teleportations , i.e. , after five times of teleportation the fidelity will be still beyond the classical limit 1/2 @xcite .",
    "repetition of teleportation is essential for the teleportation - based computation , i.e. , one - way computation . in one - way computation ,",
    "computation is achieved by changing measurement bases in each teleportation step .    as high - fidelity quantum teleportation experiments",
    ", we have realized sequential teleportation of a coherent state @xcite and teleportation of a squeezed state @xcite . in order to implement one - way quantum computation , we need to perform teleportation repeatedly .",
    "hence it is of practical importance to demonstrate sequential teleportation experimentally .",
    "moreover teleportation should be applied to an arbitrary input state including non - classical states , e.g. , a squeezed state .",
    "here squeezing below vacuum noise level indicates entanglement between the corresponding frequency sidebands . hence observing squeezing in the teleported state indicates success of teleportation of entanglement . in this section",
    ", both experimental results of sequential teleportation and teleportation of a squeezed state will be shown .    in our experiment , we use optical parametric oscillators ( opos ) which contain periodically poled ktiopo@xmath31 as a nonlinear medium @xcite . the output of a ti : sapphire laser at 860 nm is frequency doubled in an external cavity containing a 10 mm long potassium niobate crystal .",
    "the output beam at 430 nm is injected to opos .",
    "the output squeezed states of two opos are used to generate the epr beams . here",
    "we use a frequency sideband at 1mhz .    in the following ,",
    "we describe the teleportation process @xcite in the heisenberg representation .",
    "initially , the sender alice and the receiver bob share a pair of epr beams .",
    "alice performs a joint measurement on her epr mode ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) and the input mode ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) .",
    "she combines these two modes at a half beam splitter and measures @xmath36 and @xmath37 with two homodyne detectors .",
    "the measurement results ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) are then sent to bob through classical channels with gain @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "for simplicity , these gains are fixed throughout the experiment and treated as unity .",
    "bob receives alice s measurement results ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) through the classical channels and displaces his epr beam ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) accordingly , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the teleported mode can be written as @xcite @xmath46 ideally , the epr beams would have perfect correlations such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "hence , the teleported output would be identical to the input . in a real experimental situation ,",
    "epr beams have finite correlation and the variance would be written as @xmath49 ^ 2 \\right \\rangle = \\left \\langle \\left [ \\delta ( \\hat p_{\\rm a}+\\hat p_{\\rm b } ) \\right]^2 \\right \\rangle=2e^{-2r}\\sigma_{vac}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath50 is a variance of vacuum fluctuation , and r is a squeezing parameter .",
    "hence these additional noise terms are inevitably added to the output .",
    "the performance of cv quantum teleportation is determined by these noise terms . in order to improve fidelity of teleportation ,",
    "we improve the level of squeezing @xmath51 . in addition",
    ", we improve mechanical stability of the setup .",
    "this is because the imperfect phase locking makes effective squeezing level lower @xcite .    in the experiment of teleportation of a squeezed state @xcite , we use three opos and hence three squeezed vacua .",
    "one of three squeezed vacua is used as an input .",
    "fig 2 ( a ) shows the input squeezed state .",
    "the variances of the input state s squeezed ( @xmath52 ) and anti - squeezed quadratures ( @xmath53 ) are @xmath54db and @xmath55db , respectively .",
    "the result of teleportation is shown in fig . 2 ( b ) .",
    "the measured variances of the output state are @xmath56db and @xmath57db for the @xmath52 and @xmath53 quadratures , respectively .",
    "these levels of sub - vacuum noise measured in the output clearly demonstrate that the squeezing ( and hence the entanglement ) is preserved in the process of teleportation .",
    "in the experiment of sequential teleportation of a coherent state @xcite , we use four opos and construct two teleportation setup .",
    "the experimentally obtained wigner functions @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "the input coherent state was teleported twice and the individual teleportation fidelities are evaluated as @xmath58 and @xmath59 , while the fidelity between the input and the sequentially teleported states is determined as @xmath60 .",
    "this still exceeds the optimal classical teleportation fidelity @xmath61 and almost attains the value of the first ( unsequential ) quantum teleportation experiment with coherent states .",
    "a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) gate plays an important role in cv quantum information processing .",
    "this is because a qnd gate with unity interaction gain is a cv analog of a cnot gate @xcite .",
    "that is to say , we can make interaction between two optical modes with a qnd gate in the same manner as the qubit case .",
    "therefore a qnd gate is considered as one of the most fundamental cv quantum gates .",
    "a qnd gate makes interaction between two input modes with a qnd interaction hamiltonian @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "we can calculate output modes with a unitary operator @xmath63 ( e.g. , @xmath64 ) .",
    "input and output relation is obtained as , @xmath65 here @xmath66 is an interaction gain .",
    "( [ eq : qndinout ] ) implies the reason why this interaction is called as _ quantum non - demolition_. when we focus on @xmath52 quadrature , @xmath67 is preserved through interaction , on the other hand @xmath68 has the information of @xmath67 .",
    "we can get the information of @xmath67 without demolishing the @xmath67 . in this case",
    "@xmath68 works as a meter for a signal @xmath67 .",
    "notably the important aspect is that qnd interaction has duality for @xmath52 and @xmath53 quadratures . in the case of @xmath53 quadrature , @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    "are a meter and a signal , respectively .",
    "although a qnd interaction gate is naturally used for qnd measurements , qnd interaction is not necessarily needed to realize qnd measurement .",
    "conventional qnd measurement experiments consider only one quadrature @xmath52 or @xmath53 . here",
    "let us mention about the interaction gain @xmath66 . in the context of qnd measurement ,",
    "the bigger interaction gain is better .",
    "unity interaction gain @xmath71 , however , is more important for cv quantum information processing because of the correspondence to the cnot gate .",
    "hereafter we set the interaction gain @xmath66 as unity @xmath71 .",
    "notably it s worth noting the difference between a qnd gate and a beam splitter which is the most basic tool in quantum optics .",
    "beam splitters are often used to make interaction between two optical modes instead of a true cv cnot gate .",
    "beam splitter , however , can not preserve signal quadrature through interaction . then we can not achieve qnd measurement with a beam splitter .",
    "moreover the most different feature is the entangling property .",
    "it is well known that if we inject a non - classical state , e.g. , a squeezed state , into a beam splitter , the output beams are in an entangled state .",
    "beam splitter itself , however , does not have entangling property , hence can not entangle classical states like a coherent state .",
    "surprisingly a qnd interaction gate enables us to entangle even coherent states .",
    "this feature is quite contrast to a beam splitter .",
    "this is because a qnd gate itself has the entangling property .",
    "because of these superior properties of a qnd gate , a qnd gate would be of great importance for potential applications in cv quantum information processing .    in our experiment , we use coherent states as inputs . in order to verify the behavior of the qnd gate ,",
    "we check input - output relations and output - output correlations . a qnd interaction gate should work as qnd measurement for both @xmath52 and @xmath53 quadratures .",
    "hence we check qnd criteria for both @xmath52 and @xmath53 quadratures .",
    "qnd criteria are defined with transfer coefficients and conditional variances as @xcite , @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the transfer coefficient for the input signal to the output signal @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the transfer coefficient for the input signal to the output meter @xmath76 .",
    "note that @xmath77 is a correlation function between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is a conditional variance for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "these criteria are also applied to @xmath53 quadrature .",
    "in addition to these qnd criteria , we also verify entanglement between outputs , and check the entangling property of a qnd gate .    in the experiment , we realize a qnd interaction gate by using off - line scheme @xcite .",
    "the schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "4 ( a ) . here",
    "we use two off - line squeezers with squeezing parameter of which can be controlled by beam splitting ratio with suitable feedback gain .",
    "the outputs can be written with the reflectance of beam splitters r as @xcite , @xmath81    here @xmath82 and @xmath83 are squeezing parameters for ancilla squeezed vacuum states a and b. for unity gain we set @xmath84 , namely , r=0.38 .",

    "figure 4 ( b ) shows that the signal @xmath78 information is transferred to the meter @xmath79 .",
    "moreover the amplitudes of @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are almost same which assure the unity interaction gain ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we also measure the variance of @xmath88 and @xmath89 by using two vacuum states as inputs .",
    "we calculate transfer coefficients which can be expressed as @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite . here",
    "snr is signal to noise ratio , hence @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we obtain @xmath94 and @xmath95 , then @xmath96 which satisfy qnd criteria .",

    "conditional variance corresponds to the minimum value of the variance of @xmath102 .",
    "we obtain the conditional variance as @xmath104 ( similarly we measure and obtain @xmath105 )",
    ". therefore qnd criteria of eq .",
    "( [ eq : conditionalv ] ) are satisfied for both @xmath52 and @xmath53 quadrature .",
