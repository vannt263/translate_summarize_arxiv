    "it is one of the most significant problems in cosmology to understand the physical mechanism behind the late - time acceleration of the universe  @xcite .",
    "a number of scenarios have been proposed to account for this phenomenon  @xcite . in general , these fall into two categories : ( i ) the existence of an exotic form of energy with negative pressure , dubbed as `` dark energy '' , corresponding to a modification of the energy - momentum tensor in einstein equations ; and ( ii ) a modification of gravity , such as @xmath0 gravity models with @xmath0 representing an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath9-cold dark matter ( @xmath9cdm ) model is the simplest candidate of dark energy and fits a number of observational data well , which is referred to as the standard model of big bang cosmology .",
    "however , this model can not explain the origin of the inflation   or the nature of dark energy by itself , and is also embarrassed by the well known cosmological constant problems  @xcite , known as `` coincidence '' and `` fine - tuning '' problems . the lagrangian density for @xmath9cdm is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath9 is the cosmological constant .    at present , the cosmological observations can not distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity models .",
    "an important reason for the interest on the modified gravity theories is that the late - time acceleration of the universe can be realized without recourse to an explicit dark energy matter component  @xcite , while @xmath0 gravity is one of the popular and simplest modifications to general relativity ( gr )  @xcite .",
    "there are two approaches to derive field equations from the action in @xmath0 gravity , i.e. , the metric and palatini formalisms . in gr ,",
    "the two approaches provide identical field equations . however , they give rise to different field equations for the @xmath0 models with non - linear forms of the lagrangian density .",
    "it is pointed out that the palatini @xmath0 gravity appears to be in conflict with the standard model of particle physics  @xcite .",
    "given this , the metric @xmath0 gravity is preferred .",
    "the viability of @xmath0 gravity is examined with various criteria  @xcite , such as the local gravity constraints , the presence of the matter - dominated epoch , the stability of cosmological perturbations , the stability of the late - time de sitter point , and avoiding anti - gravity .",
    "the exponential @xmath0 gravity theory in the metric formalism is one of the viable models , which contains only one more parameter than the @xmath9cdm model and has been broadly studied in the literature  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the constraints on this model from the latest measurement on the hubble parameter @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , several other popular probes are also associated in the joint analysis , including the distance measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) from 6dfgs , wigglez and sdss iii data release 11 ( dr11 ) and type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) from the scp union2 compilation , as well as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements of the shift parameters from planck and wmap-9 .",
    "the dynamical features of the model are also analyzed , such as the evolutions of the effective equations of state ( eos ) @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and the deceleration parameter @xmath5 .",
