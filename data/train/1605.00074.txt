    "the observed photospheric magnetic field appears as distributed concentrations over the entire solar surface .",
    "these concentrations are charactirized by a variety of magnetic features ( i.e. elements ) that span over a huge range of spatial scales , from active regions down to small - scale mixed - polarity features of the quiet sun network and internetwork @xcite . in the quiet sun",
    "( hereafter referred to as qs ) , the aforementioned elements possess magnetic fluxes of the order of @xmath4 mx @xcite .",
    "these elements also show rich and complex dynamics , both in time and space , and interact with each other in a variety of ways as a consequence of the constant motions of the underlying flow patterns ( i.e. convective motions ) .",
    "the characterization of the elements is of crucial importance for many research topic within solar physics , such as : understanding the coupling between the different solar atmospheric layers @xcite , relation between the magnetic flux budget and coronal heating @xcite , extrapolations towards the solar corona @xcite , inferring semi - empirical magneto - hydrostatic models of the corona @xcite and solar wind @xcite , etcetera .",
    "+ the evolution of the qs magnetic features is studied in terms of flux emergence , cancellation , coalescence and fragmentation that give a certain intermittent distribution of fluxes over the solar surface .",
    "the statistics of the flux distribution is described by the so - called magnetochemistry @xcite .",
    "methodologically , the magnetochemistry is based on the identification and tracking of particular features @xcite .",
    "a prominent progress in our understanding of the solar surface magnetism has been achieved by methods based on feature tracking ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; and references therein ) . however",
    ", a comparison of the different feature - tracking algorithms @xcite , has showed that the characterization of the features is strongly affected by the choice of the algorithm and the assumptions they make ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "+ a key concern was voiced by @xcite : `` measurement of the behavior of small magnetic features on the photosphere is limited , partly by the spatial and temporal resolution of the observing instruments , and partly by the difficulty of following visual features that do not behave exactly like discrete physical objects '' .",
    "an later : `` experience has shown @xcite that even automated methods of solar feature tracking , produced by different authors with the intention of reproducing others results , have myriad built - in assumptions and subjectivity of their own unless great care is taken in specifying the algorithm exactly '' .",
    "+ motivated by these concerns , in this work we will try to obtain observationally useful and physically meaningful information about the nature of the magnetic flux concentrations in the qs , without subjective assumptions about the interaction and identification of the such features . in particular , we will show that the time - sequence of the magnetic flux density across surfaces with normal vectors perpendicular to the line - of - sight ( referred to as @xmath0 ) , and normal vector parallel to the line of sight ( referred to as @xmath1 ) , as well as the magnetic pressure ( @xmath2 ) , at a given position on the quiet solar surface verify the properties of a markov chain . to demonstrate",
    "this will employ observations of the solar magnetic field on the quiet photosphere taken by the sunrise / imax instrument ( section  [ section : observations ] ) and study specific relations for the joint probability and conditional probability density functions ( section  [ section : analysis ] ) for the three aforementioned time - varying quantities : @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
