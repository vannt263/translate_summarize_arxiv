    "the nuclear accident in the fukushima area in japan released radioisotopes to the atmosphere which have been measured in several locations in asia @xcite , north america @xcite , and europe @xcite , as the radioactivity spread around the earth .",
    "we report here the measurement of several isotopes in water samples collected in eastern north america during april  2011 , from 3 to 7  weeks after the fukushima incident .",
    "to investigate the dispersal of radioactivity from the fukushima incident we collected samples of rainwater in aluminum trays in greater sudbury , ontario on 3 , 16 , 20 , and 26  april , the first rainy days that followed 11  march . a reference sample of ice water from meatbird lake in lively , ontario",
    "was also collected on 3  april . within 12  d of their collection",
    "the water samples were passed through whatman grade 1 filters ( medium porosity , @xmath6 m ) and then poured into 1  l polyethylene marinelli beakers .",
    "filtration was necessary to remove particulate material that was present in the samples because they were collected at ground level under windy conditions .",
    "the volume of all samples was very close to 1  l. the beakers were sealed , encapsulated in nearly air - tight bags , and transported to the snolab underground laboratory where they were @xmath0-ray counted by a high - purity germanium detector . to minimize the background from ambient @xmath7rn in the mine air  @xcite , the samples began to be counted immediately after their arrival underground .",

    "the half - life of the observed decay is 3.7  d , considerably less than the 8.0  d half - life of @xmath1i .",

    "the ratio of activity of @xmath4cs to @xmath2cs is shown in figure  [ 134to137_vs_time ] .",
    "the weighted average ratio for the four measurements is @xmath59 , in agreement with the value of @xmath600.7 reported in @xcite and the measurements given in @xcite .",
    "this ratio is approximately constant because both of these isotopes are products of nuclear fission , @xmath2cs directly , and @xmath4cs by fission production of @xmath5cs followed by neutron capture .",
    "some laboratories @xcite have detected @xmath61te from the fukushima incident , but we did not observe this isotope .",
    "our supposition is that this is because of its short half - life of 3.2  d , the appreciable delay between the release and our first measurements , and the low volatility of te .    at no time during our measurements",
    "were the activities of the isotopes we detected from fukushima of any radioactive concern to the inhabitants of northern ontario .",
    "the average radioactivity levels were much less than what is received by normal background radiation and we were only able to observe these isotopes because of our extremely sensitive well - shielded low - background apparatus .",
    "several nuclear reactor fission products were observed in rainwater samples collected in greater sudbury and @xmath0-ray counted in a high - purity germanium detector at snolab .",
    "the short - lived isotope @xmath1i and the longer - lived isotopes @xmath4cs and @xmath2cs , were detected at concentrations much higher than in a background sample .",
    "the presence of all these isotopes is associated with their release to the atmosphere from the nuclear accident at the fukushima dai - ichi reactors in japan . these data , along with measurements made in other places around the world ,",
    "may aid our understanding of the release of radioactive fission products and their transport in the atmosphere .",
