    "such kind of point interaction potential can then be addressed by the self - adjoint extension approach @xcite .",

    "the introduction of spin changes the situation completely .",
    "the singularity at the origin due to the spin is physically equivalent to extract this single point from the plane @xmath67 and in this case the translational invariance is lost together with the self - adjointness .",
    "this fact has impressive consequences in the spectrum of the system @xcite .",

    "we shall see that for all values of this parameter there is an additional scattering amplitude resulting from the interaction of the spin with the magnetic flux ; if the parameter is negative there is a bound state with a negative eigenvalue .",
    "the existence of a negative eigenvalue in the spectrum can be considered rather unexpected , since the actions of suggest it as a positive definite operator .",
    "however , the positivity of such an operator does not just depend on its action , but also depend on its domain .",
    "indeed , there are several works in the literature which use the self - adjoint extensions and claim the existence of such a bound state .",
    "for example , the works of gerbert _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , jackiw @xcite ( in this reference an equivalence between renormalization and self - adjoint extension is discussed ) , voropaev _ et al . _",

    "the self - adjoint extension approach consists , essentially , in extending the domain @xmath113 to match @xmath114 in , turning @xmath98 a self - adjoint operator .",
