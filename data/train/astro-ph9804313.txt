    "the discovery of the soft x - ray / euv background ( @xcite ) and its anti - correlation with the galactic hi distribution has led to an on - going debate on the origin of that emission . since an absorption column density of @xmath0@xmath1 ( which corresponds to an optical depth @xmath2 at 0.25kev )",
    "is reached at a distance of approximately 100pc in the direction of the galactic plane , the diffuse background must arise from hot gas in the local interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "optical and uv absorption line measurements of nearby stars together with observations in the x - ray and euv wavelength range have established a local region with a significant hi deficiency which is partly filled with a plasma , the so - called `` local bubble '' ( lb ) .",
    "no definite model exists for this region and its origin is unclear .",
    "one view is that the gas in the lb has been heated by a supernova explosion which occurred in the solar neighborhood about @xmath3yr ago ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "other authors claim that the lb is part of an asymmetrically shaped superbubble created by stellar winds and supernova explosions ( cf .",
    ". however , the physical properties such as density , temperature , pressure , and extension of the lb , are not well determined and so far observational constraints are insufficient to establish a canonical model of the evolution and the origin of the lb .",
    "the mckee & ostriker model is the best known model but it is not easily testable . only soft x - ray and euv observations provide a direct method to study the hot gas in the ism and test lb models .",
    "this paper presents new measurements for the thermal pressure in the local ism , using observations of nearby clouds taken by the deep survey ( ds ) telescope on - board the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( euve ) .",
    "prior to this paper , bowyer  et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) reported on the first detection of a spatial absorption feature in the diffuse euv background ; this feature was positionally coincident with an iras cirrus cloud at a distance of @xmath4 40pc . since the cloud casting this shadow is optically thick at euv wavelengths , the authors concluded that all residual euv emission observed at the position of the cloud originated from material along the line of sight in front of the cloud . by attributing the background subtracted flux in front of the cloud to the hot gas in the ism , bowyer  et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) derived for the length of the emitting region ( 40pc ) a pressure ( p/@xmath5 ) of 19,000@xmath6k .",
    "these authors pointed out that an imperfect zero level calibration of the data can lead to a smaller value for the pressure , and estimated a lower limit for the pressure of 7,000@xmath6k .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a re - observation of the previously reported cloud shadow in the euv background and observations of two new shadows discovered in the ds .",
    "for all three shadow regions we provide new optical photometry data which establishes the distance of the respective clouds .",
    "we employ a differential cloud technique which does not depend on any zero level calibration , to obtain the pressure of the ism in these directions .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : first , in sect .  2 we describe our new observations and the data analysis .",
    "in sect .  3 , we employ a new analysis technique and compare our results for the three cloud shadows .",
    "we derive physical quantities of the hot interstellar gas from our observations . finally , in sect .  4 , we discuss the implications for models of the local ism .",
    "after launch in june 1992 the euve satellite performed an all - sky survey in four bandpasses in the spectral range between 70 and 800 .",
    "details about the euve mission and the instrumentation can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we only summarize the capabilities of the ds instrument which has been used to obtain the euve data discussed in this paper .",
    "the ds instrument , consisting of a grazing incidence telescope and two broad band filters ( lexan / boron filter : 65190 , al / carbon filter : 160385 ) in front of an imaging microchannel plate detector , is mounted perpendicular to the other scanner telescopes . during the euve survey phase , the ds made deep exposures of the sky along the ecliptic plane .",
    "a schematic layout of the ds detector field can be found in lieu  et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) . owing to its anti - solar pointing direction ,",
    "the ds instrument observed about @xmath7 of the galactic plane per day . with a typical exposure of 20ksec",
    "/ pixel the ds is about a factor of 10 more sensitive than the euve all - sky survey . generally speaking , diffuse emission is difficult to detect with microchannel plate detectors which exhibit a large instrumental background .",
    "it is thus clear that the ds data are better suited for a search for diffuse structures in the euv background than the much shorter exposed euve all - sky survey data .",
    "lieu  et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed that the diffuse astrophysical background contributes about 25% of the total count rate observed in the lex / b filter of the ds instrument , and used a ` filter frame subtraction ' method to remove particle background contamination from the diffuse background data .",
    "the resulting lex / b count rates were correlated with such terrestrial coordinates as satellite position , solar zenith angle and magnetic l - value , to identify and eliminate periods of data when the count rates are higher than the stable minimum value .",
    "we first discuss our re - observation of lb165 - 32 . as a naming convention for the shadowing clouds discussed here we use the letters `` lb '' followed by the galactic coordinates of the cloud in degrees .",
    "in this re - observation we used a different observational technique than that employed in the original observation .",
    "the longitudinal side of the filter was maintained at a 90@xmath8 orientation with respect to the ecliptic plane to maximize the exposed region above and below the plane . in the original observation during the euve ds this filter was constantly rotating about the ds axis . in both the original ds scan as well as in the re - observation , the same field of view of @xmath9 ,",
    "excluding the area of a dead spot ( @xmath10 ) was observed .",
    "however , the rotating filter configuration during the ds leads to a shorter exposure of those parts of the scan located outside the inner @xmath11 swath centered on the ecliptic plane . depending on the size , shape , and orientation of the interstellar absorption feature",
    ", this could result in a difference between the ds and re - observation count rates .",
    "we carried out a series of tests with a variety of synthetic absorption features folded with the spatial detector response and established a change in the count rates by up to 20% .",
    "in figure  [ euvedata ] we plot a pulse height spectrum of the lex / b filter counts detected during the re - observation of the cloud lb165 - 32 .",
    "the observed spectrum presented in figure  [ euvedata ] consists of a prominent gaussian profile and an exponential background distribution .",
    "the gaussian profile is typical of photon data from point sources and indicates that more than 90% of the diffuse counts are contributed by photons .",
    "this confirms and strengthens the results of lieu  et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) who showed using different techniques that we are detecting photons , not charged particles , in these observations . our new analysis technique ( discussed later )",
    ", shows that about 50% of these photons are astronomical in origin .",
    "the nonastronomical photons are believed to be a combination of scattered geocoronal and solar euv and x - ray emission .    in the upper panel of figure  [ 165euv ]",
    ", we plot our new results on the diffuse background as a function of the ecliptic longitude for lb165 - 32 . for comparison ,",
    "the original observation is shown in the middle panel ; the plotted scan of the ecliptic plane begins at galactic coordinates @xmath12 and ends at @xmath13 .",
    "it is evident that an absorption feature is present in both data sets .",
    "the dashed lines ( upper and middle panel ) give the average background levels for the two scans outside the shadow region . in the case of the ds observation",
    ", this background has been determined from the scan range between ecliptic longitude @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for the re - observation we determined the background from the scan at ecliptic longitude above @xmath16 and below @xmath17 .",
    "the respective average diffuse background count rates are 0.495 @xmath18 0.06cts / s for the ds scan and 0.612@xmath18 0.026cts / s for the re - observation ; the count rates correspond to a field of view of 0.7433 square degree . in the lower panel of figure  [ 165euv ]",
    "we plot an ir - emission scan across lb165 - 32 which we constructed from the continuum subtracted iras 100@xmath19 m sky map that has been folded with the spatial response of the rotating ds lex / b filter region used to extract the euv background scan across lb165 - 32 .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ 165euv ] , the absorption feature in the euve data is positionally coincident with an enhanced emission feature in the iras 100@xmath19 m data in the ecliptic plane near ecliptic longitude @xmath20 . in both independent euve observations",
    "the absorption feature appears with a significance of 3  3.5@xmath21 below the average background level .",
    "these two independent measurements , both at greater than than 3@xmath21 leave no doubt about the detection of this shadow in the euv background .",
    "modeling of synthetic absorption profiles folded with the detector spatial responses shows that the different shape of the absorption feature and the roughly 20% higher count rates during the re - observation of lb165 - 32 is explained by the modified observing technique used in the re - observation .",
    "for the ds scan of lb165 - 32 we find at the position of the cloud a minimum count rate of @xmath22cts / s . from the scan regions immediately adjacent to the cloud ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) we determine a local continuum diffuse euv background rate of 0.51 @xmath18 0.06cts / s .",
    "we have found a second absorption feature in the euv background which we designate as lb27 - 31 . in the upper panel of figure  [ 27euv ]",
    "we show the euve ds scan of the ecliptic plane near ecliptic longitude @xmath25 beginning at galactic coordinates @xmath26 and ending at @xmath27 .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ 27euv ] shows the ir emission for this sky location .",
    "both the euv background as well as the ir emission have been reduced in the same way as described for lb165 - 32 .",
    "the euv background absorption feature in the galactic plane centered near ecliptic longitude @xmath28 appears at the position of an iras cirrus cloud .",
    "again , a comparison of the euve ds data with the iras 100@xmath19 m data provides evidence for a prominent ( 5@xmath21 ) shadow in the euv background cast by a cloud in the local ism .",
    "the minimum count rate of @xmath29cts / s at the position of the shadowing cloud is taken from the data point at @xmath30 . by averaging the observed count rates between @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    ", we determine a local continuum count rate of @xmath33cts / s ,    a third cloud shadow ( designated as lb329 + 46 ) was found in the ds data in the range @xmath34 ( corresponding to galactic coordinates between @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "this scan is shown in figure  [ 329euv ] .",
    "with respect to the mean ds lex / b diffuse background count rate ( dashed line in figure  [ 329euv ] ) , taken from the scan range between @xmath37 excluding the region @xmath38 , the euv background exhibits a 4@xmath21 absorption feature between @xmath39 as well as an enhanced emission feature near @xmath40 .",
    "the comparison with the iras 100@xmath19 m data shows that the absorption feature is spatially coincident with two ir emission features near @xmath41 and @xmath42 ; the iras 100@xmath19 m sky map shows two finger - like emission structures crossing the ecliptic plane at these positions ( note that the zero flux of the ir scan is a result of the subtracted continuum which has been taken from the region near @xmath40 ) .",
    "we adopted a count rate of @xmath43cts / s for the position of the shadow . from the regions near @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "we obtain a local euv background count rate of @xmath46cts / s .",
    "the significantly lower ir emission near @xmath40 indicates a much lower absorption column in this direction .",
    "the higher euv emission ( @xmath47cts / s ) in this region can be explained by a larger emission column along this line of sight .      in this subsection",
    "we present our optical observations of stars in the direction of these shadows . in order to determine the distance to the euv - absorbing clouds we have used detailed strmgren photometry ;",
    "this technique has been shown to provide the absolute magnitude and reddening of most classes of main - sequence stars ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "all photometry was carried out with the strmgren automatic telescope at eso la silla , chile .",
    "the stars for observation were selected from the position and proper motion star catalog ( @xcite ) and the space telescope guide star catalogue ( @xcite ) .",
    "the error propagation of the uvby@xmath48 indices result in a typical error of roughly 15% for the distance to the stars investigated . for 34 of our 210 program stars",
    "hipparcos parallaxes exist . for these stars the distances obtained by strmgren photometry agree within the errors of the hipparcos measurements .",
    "this provides confirmation of the accuracy of our distance estimates for the overlapping stars .",
    "a detailed discussion of this comparison including all our optical data of the individual stars in the cloud regions can be found in @xcite . in table  [ stars ] we provide a summary of the optical data of the stars that we use to establish the distance of the shadowing clouds .",
    "for each of these 8 stars , table  [ stars ] provides the position in galactic coordinates , the distance derived from our photometry data and from the hipparcos data , and the reddening e@xmath49 .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     in figure  [ ratedist ] we plot the ds lex / b filter count rates versus the respective distances for all three cloud shadows .",
    "the different cloud shadow regions are marked by different symbols , the distance upper limits are indicated by left arrows . as is evident from figure  [ ratedist ] almost all the data points are reasonably fit with a straight line .",
    "we performed several correlation tests and confirmed the existence of a tight correlation between",
    "the ds lex / b filter count rates and the distances of the clouds .",
    "the formal results of a parametric linear regression analysis of the data ( including the two distance upper limits ) are 0.002 @xmath18 0.0003cts / spc@xmath50 for the slope and 0.331 @xmath18 0.045cts / s for the intercept of the regression line .",
    "this line is plotted in figure  [ ratedist ] .",
    "the slope of the regression line gives the diffuse euv flux per emitting length which we use to derive the pressure of the plasma in the ism .",
    "figure  [ ratedist ] includes the regression lines ( dotted lines ) for the individual lines of sight .",
    "the individual lines of sight show slopes between 0.0015cts / spc@xmath50 ( lb27 - 31 ) and 0.0027cts / spc@xmath50 ( lb165 - 32 ) which deviate by -25% and + 35% from the value obtained by the regression analysis including all clouds .",
    "we believe these limits reflect all uncertainties due to possible variations of the absorption column in the foreground of the different clouds , and within these uncertainties all data of all three lines of sight can be explained by the same slope . in the next section , where we compute the pressure of the hot ism gas ,",
    "we show that these uncertainties can affect the inferred pressure value by only 1015% .",
    "the tight correlation between observed diffuse euv flux and emitting length implies essentially the same pressure in all three cloud directions . in figure  [ clouddir ]",
    "we show a plot of the cloud locations in a projection from above the galactic plane .",
    "as can be seen the detected euv - absorbing clouds are located in three significantly different directions .",
    "this is important for our conclusions for the hot gas in the ism and is further addressed in sect .",
    "[ discus ] .",
    "an additional point is that the y - intercept provides a zero level calibration for our cloud shadow observations with the euve ds instrument .",
    "this zero level can be used to subtract the nonastronomical photons from the euve observations and allows us to measure absolute fluxes for the diffuse euv background ; we note that about 50% of all detected photons are astronomical in origin .",
    "consequently , the pressure value derived from the slope of the regression line not only provides the average pressure of the material in the distance range @xmath51 40  180pc ( between the shadowing cloud and the larger background cloud ) , it also allows us to determine the thermal pressure of the ism in the regions in front of the three clouds .",
    "it is noteworthy that these zero level corrected values also give the same pressure for the material in the foreground of the three shadowing clouds .",
    "we point out that intrinsic absorption along the lines of sight can have flattened the apparent correlation between euv flux and distance .",
    "therefore , the given value for the y - intercept represents an upper limit .",
    "we now utilize the results of our cloud shadow observations to compute the pressure of the local ism from the ideal gas law @xmath52 where p is the pressure , @xmath5 is the boltzmann s constant , em / l is the emission measure per emitting length , and t is the temperature ; the factor of 1.92 accounts for the number of free particles ( electrons + ions ) in the plasma .",
    "the conversion of the observed euve ds count rates per emitting length into em /",
    "l is model dependent .",
    "a detailed discussion of the implications of different plasma models and plasma emissivity codes on the pressure of the local ism will be given elsewhere .",
    "here we use the typically assumed model spectrum of a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium at a temperature of @xmath53k . to account for absorption in the foreground of the clouds",
    "we include a foreground ism absorption column of n@xmath54 in our model . with the plasma emissivity code provided by landini  &  monsignori - fossi  ( @xcite )",
    "we derive em / l = 7.3 @xmath55 and a pressure p/@xmath56k ; for a raymond  &  smith  ( @xcite ) model of the same parameters we obtain em / l = @xmath57 and p/@xmath58k .",
    "the column density of the local cloud around our sun in the three view directions varies between n@xmath59 ( lb27 - 31 ) and n@xmath60 ( lb165 - 32 ) ( p. jelinsky 1998 , private communication ) .",
    "this might explain some of the deviation between the data obtained in the individual view directions .",
    "however , a 10 times lower absorption column density affects the inferred emission measure by 30% and thus results in an uncertainty of the pressure value of only 15% . any significant absorption by cold gas in front of the clouds exceeding n@xmath54 would depress the apparent diffuse euv flux with increasing emitting length in the ism and , thus , increase the pressure of the hot gas in the ism .",
    "we point out that the variation in the pressure value resulting from the use of different plasma emissivity codes ( which is a general problem in high energy astrophysics ) exceeds the error in the determination of the euve ds count rate per emitting length as derived from the slope of the regression line in figure  [ ratedist ] .",
    "the latter results in an error of 1015% for the pressure value . strictly speaking , our value represents a lower limit for the actual value of the pressure . because we measure the count rate deficit at the position of a shadowing cloud against the local background , any flux contribution from behind the shadowing clouds reduces the respective count rate deficit . since we can not definitely exclude such contributions , the actual value for the slope of the regression line can be higher . additional intrinsic absorption along the lines of sight strengthens this effect .",
    "therefore , the derived value p/@xmath61k provides a lower limit for the pressure of the local ism .",
    "we have presented a re - observation of a cloud shadow in the diffuse euv background discovered by bowyer  et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) and present two additional shadows detected in the euve ds .",
    "we have developed a new method to derive the diffuse astrophysical euv background from the euve ds data .",
    "this differential cloud technique can be applied to any cloud shadow data without a known zero level calibration . in our case",
    "we can extrapolate the results to the origin and obtain a zero level calibration for the ds detector .",
    "this zero level calibration indicates that about 50% of the detected photons are astronomical in origin .",
    "more importantly , this zero level calibration allows a determination of the diffuse euv background in the direction of the three nearby cloud shadows and hence to derive the pressure in the regions between us and these clouds .",
    "the pressure obtained for these nearby regions is consistent with the value obtained from the differential measurements for the more distant regions along the lines of sight .",
    "the results of our cloud shadow observations with euve provide evidence for a constant pressure in three different directions in the local ism .",
    "we derived a pressure of p/@xmath56k .",
    "the canonical value obtained from the analysis of solar he  i 584  radiation resonantly scattered by helium in the inflowing cloud is p/@xmath62k ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "based on line measurements with euve , vallerga ( @xcite ) derived a pressure for the solar cloud in the range p/@xmath63k which is in good agreement with results obtained by @xcite , p/@xmath64k ) .",
    "a comparison of these results shows the pressure of the local ism exceeds the pressure of the cloud surrounding our sun by a factor of @xmath65 . the original observation ( bowyer  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) of a pressure imbalance between the solar cloud and the surrounding local ism could have been the result of a nearby shock wave which had not yet reached the sun .",
    "the results reported here are obtained in three different directions .",
    "the isotropy in the results for all these directions is not consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "flux in the soft x - ray bandpass requires a larger absorption column density to reach unit optical depth and it is difficult or impossible to separate the locally produced diffuse soft x - ray emission from contributions originating at larger distances .",
    "soft x - ray observations , therefore , typically provide only an upper limit for the pressure of the local ism . as discussed previously , the pressure obtained from our cloud shadow observations in the euv is strictly interpreted as a lower limit .",
    "although different plasma codes have been used by different authors , the pressure derived from our cloud shadow observations with euve is about the same as values derived from soft x - ray observations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite)when we use the same code ( p/@xmath5(euv ) = 13500 @xmath6k ; p/@xmath5(soft x - ray ) = 14000 @xmath6k ) .",
    "the near equality of these upper and lower limits implies we have measured the true pressure .    beyond the cloud surrounding our sun we found no significant intrinsic cold gas absorption in the local ism .",
    "this supports the idea of a cavity primarily filled with an ionized plasma .",
    "interstellar absorption lines in the spectra of nearby stars have indicated the existence of cloudlets of cold gas ( like the local cloud around our sun ) in the solar vicinity ( lallement  @xcite ) . however , the effect of these cloudlets on the diffuse euv emission observed in the directions of the cloud shadows discussed here is negligible .",
    "we point out that the different line of sights for the six clouds discussed here show that the local ism can not be simply described as a sphere with an almost constant radius ( @xcite ) .",
    "our observations provide evidence for a large pressure imbalance in the local ism compared to the local cloud surrounding our sun .",
    "this contradicts the basic assumption of almost all available models for the local ism of a pressure equilibrium ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is unclear what physical mechanism can maintain such a large pressure imbalance .",
    "we emphasize that these models as well as the calculations in the here presented work assume a hot plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "a completely different approach is provided by breitschwerdt & schmutzler ( @xcite ) .",
    "their model calculations are based on an adiabatically cooling non - equilibrium plasma .",
    "the advantage of this model is that it can at least qualitatively explain many of the observed features of the local ism and it does not require pressure equilibrium in the local ism .",
