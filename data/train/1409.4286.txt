    "membranes using nanoporous two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials are emerging as attractive candidates for applications in molecular separations and related areas@xcite . in particular , graphene - based materials@xcite exhibit vantage points with respect to conventional 3d materials , by virtue of their thermal and chemical stability as well as a low molecular weight and efficient transport capability .",
    "graphene sheets do not have pores for molecular sieving and the introduction of sub - nanometer pores is required to obtain sufficient molecular permeance .",
    "this can be achieved by means of `` top - down '' fabrication methods able to create holes in suspended graphene sheets@xcite , which , however , are in general not sufficiently controllable . `` bottom - up '' assembly processes represent a valuable alternative and have permitted the synthesis of new 2d materials characterized by regular and uniformly distributed sub - nanometer pores .",
    "the most promising examples are graphdiyne@xcite and 2d polyphenylene honeycomb ( 2dpph ) @xcite . in the former ,",
    "peculiar triangular pores arise from carbon chains formed by two conjugated c - c triple bonds that link adjacent benzene rings . in the latter ,",
    "the resulting structure is instead similar to that of graphene but with one missing hexagon per unit cell which is passivated by hydrogens , leading to almost circular openings ( see fig .",
    ". the successful synthesis of these materials has led to important theoretical studies devoted , firstly , to their application as effective single - layer membranes for gas separation and water filtration technologies @xcite and , secondly , to the tailoring of related porous 2d structures by changing pore shape and size through the incorporation of functional groups @xcite .    in this work",
    "we want to assess the capability of the recently synthesized graphdiyne and 2dpph materials as efficient membranes for helium separation applications .",
    "as it is well known , helium is an irreplaceable natural resource and its growing demand in a variety of industrial and scientific applications , together with ongoing production deficiencies , has recently led to shortages of this element@xcite . specifically , the lighter isotope , @xmath1he , is crucial for large neutron - scattering facilities and the depletion of its stockpiling might also affect fundamental research@xcite in ultracold physics and chemistry .",
    "natural gas remains the richest and most accessible source of helium even if its concentration is less than 1% in most of the helium - producing wells .",
    "unfortunately most of the natural - gas plants treat helium as a valueless gas and vent it to the atmosphere . therefore advanced and efficient technologies for its `` in situ '' recovery",
    "are highly desirable .",
    "existing methods for performing both the chemical separation of he from natural gas and the separation of he isotopes require energetically costly techniques , such as cryogenic distillation and pressure - swing adsorption@xcite . in principle",
    "membrane - based gas separation has a much lower thermodynamic cost@xcite and recent theoretical works have proposed the use of 2d membranes for the chemical@xcite and isotopic@xcite separation of he gas . in particular , studies on he permeability through 2dpph membranes were already addressed@xcite but , to our knowledge , the graphdiyne capability for he separation has not been investigated yet . moreover , in our opinion , the reliability of the he2dpph penetration barriers , obtained by means of the density functional theory ( dft)@xcite and second - order mller - plesset perturbation ( mp2)@xcite methodology , might need a deeper analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 refers the computational methodologies for electronic structure calculations as well as the quantum mechanical tools used to calculate the penetration probabilities . in section 3",
    "we present our results concerning the barriers and the quantum simulations using new force fields , optimized from the electronic structure calculations .",
    "the paper ends with section 4 , in which some conclusions are summarized .",
    "the electronic structure calculations have been carried out at the `` coupled '' supermolecular second - order mller - plesset perturbation theory ( mp2c)@xcite level of theory by using the molpro2012.1 package@xcite .",
    "the geometry of the systems is that of fig .",
    "1.a , and for the pores we have considered the following bond lengths@xcite : 1.431  for the aromatic c - c , 1.231  for triple c - c , 1.337  for the single c - c between two triple c - c bonds , 1.395  for the single c - c connecting aromatic and triple c - c bonds and 1.09  for c - h bonds . the aug - cc - pvtz@xcite basis set was employed for the pore structures , while the aug - cc - pv5z@xcite basis has been used for rare gases and methane molecule .",
    "all considered molecular structures are treated as rigid bodies : the atoms composing the investigated pores are frozen in their initial positions and the molecular configuration of methane is not allowed to relax during the calculations .",
    "the interaction energies have been further corrected for the basis set superposition error by the counterpoise method of boys and bernardi@xcite .    for the calculation of the transmission probabilities of the atom / molecule through the pores we have employed a model that makes use of wave packet propagation .",
    "this technique is specially well suited for this system@xcite since it is not necessary to invoke any periodicity and defects and many other interesting features can be naturally taken into account .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation was solved by propagating wave packets in a potential energy surface that is symmetric with respect to the origin , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 represents the distance between the atom and the membrane . the initial wave packet is@xcite    @xmath5 \\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 0.434 @xmath7 a.u .",
    ", @xmath8 is a sufficiently large distance ( typically 12 - 16  ) , and @xmath9 is chosen such that @xmath10 is close to the barrier height , where @xmath11 is the mass of the colliding particle .",
    "the wave packet is represented in a grid from @xmath12 to @xmath13 ( @xmath14= 50  ) and is propagated using the split operator method@xcite .",
    "the transmission probability is obtained by evaluating the probability current at the barrier ( @xmath15)@xcite    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the stationary wave function .",
    "it is computed from the fourier transform of the time - dependent wave packet ,    _ e ( z ) = dt e^iet/ ( z , t ) ,    with    a(e ) = c dz e^i k z ( z , t=0 )    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is important to note that , with this choice for the normalization of the stationary wave function , the probability current of eq .",
    "( 2 ) becomes adimensional and , in addition , it exactly corresponds to the transmission probability@xcite .",
    "finally , the temperature - dependent transmission probability , @xmath20 , was computed from numerical integration of @xmath21 , weighted by a one - dimensional maxwell - boltzmann distribution of molecular velocities .",
    "in fig . 1.a we report the molecular structures that can be considered as the smallest precursors@xcite of graphdiyine and 2dpph and which are here used to study their pores .",
    "it can be seen that , inside the pores , smaller black figures are also depicted .",
    "their area corresponds to the effective pore size which has been estimated by considering the van der waals ( vdw ) radii of the acetylenic carbon bonds , for graphdiyne , and of the inner hydrogen atoms , for 2dpph ( @xmath22 1.6  and 1.3  , respectively ) .",
    "the side length of the inner triangle is 3.9  , for graphdiyne , and the diameter of the inner circle is 0.8  for 2dpph . in the same way ,",
    "the helium vdw diameter is 2.6 @xcite(represented by a double - headed arrow in fig .",
    "1.a ) and it is smaller than the graphdiyne pore side but larger than the diameter of the 2dpph circular opening .",
    "this comparison already suggests that he penetration should be easy in graphdiyne pores and more difficult when passing through the 2dpph smaller pore .",
    "a more quantitative assessment comes from electronic structure calculations .",
    "the prototypical systems of fig .",
    "1 are small enough to allow the use of the high level ( and computationally expensive ) mp2c approach and , at the same time , they are large enough to describe the interaction features of the pores , as demonstrated by test calculations in which we have considered further prototypes of increasing size .",
    "the accuracy of the mp2c method , which is particularly suited to recover non - covalent weak interactions , has been recently assessed by extensive calculations of rare gas ",
    "fullerene@xcite and -coronene@xcite interaction energies and it was concluded that the mp2c results are in good agreement with density functional theory - symmetry adapted perturbation theory ( dft - sapt)@xcite calculations , with the advantage of a significantly lower computational cost . in fig . 1.b we report the calculated potential energy profiles for one helium atom perpendicularly approaching the 2d structures . in particular , @xmath4 is the distance between helium and the geometric center of the pores . it can be seen that the penetration barrier ( defined as the energy difference between @xmath4=0 and @xmath23 , e@xmath24 ) is high ( about 0.516 ev ) for 2dpph but becomes much lower ( about 0.033 ev ) for graphdiyne .",
    "the he2dpph penetration barrier was previously obtained by means of mp2 and dft calculations and found to be 0.523@xcite and 0.430@xcite ev , respectively .",
    "our estimation is in between the previous calculations and closer to the mp2 value .",
    "present value should be considered as the reference one since , to our knowledge , the employed dispersion corrected dft approach@xcite has not been sufficiently tested on this specific system .",
    "in fact we have determined that the calculated penetration barrier may vary depending on both the adopted density functional and a posteriori empirical dispersion correction .",
    "also , in our opinion the mp2 estimation@xcite has been obtained by using basis sets ( cc - pvdz and cc - pvtz ) not sufficiently extended , thus neglecting diffuse functions that we have found to be important to properly describe the interaction in this system .",
    "moreover the standard mp2 approach lacks the correction included in the mp2c method@xcite which is indeed needed to improve the description of non - covalent interactions@xcite . as an example , we have estimated that by using the same basis set the penetration barrier at the mp2 level of theory would be about 7% larger than present mp2c value .",
    "as for the he  graphdiyne system , it should be stressed that the calculated barrier of few tens of mev is not only much lower than that for 2dpph , but also represents an energy gap comparable with other proposed 2d materials which , however , have not been fully synthesized yet .",
    "they include partially nitrogen functionalized porous graphene@xcite ( about 0.025 ev ) and porous graphene - e - stilbene-1 @xcite ( about 0.050 ev ) .    barrier heights could be further reduced if the optimization of the position of the atoms defining the pores is taken into account . in fact",
    ", related additional calculations at the density functional level of theory ( dft ) have been performed by considering the full `` periodic '' structure of a single graphdiyne layer and we have found that the barrier can lower by about 15@xmath25 due to the deformation of the pores ( see fig .",
    "s1 of the supporting information ) . to examine the efficiency of the two kinds of pores for helium permeation in more detail , we have considered a simple arrhenius behavior for the diffusion rate @xmath26 as a function of the temperature @xmath27 : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the computed penetration barrier . as it is custumary in this context@xcite we have taken the same diffusion prefactor @xmath30=10@xmath31s@xmath32 for both pores .",
    "the related diffusion rates are reported in fig . 1.c and it can be seen that graphdiyne exhibits a much higher permeability than 2dpph in an ample range of temperature , being the difference of about eight orders of magnitude at room temperature .",
    "these results clearly show that , due to its `` ad hoc '' pore size , a graphdiyne membrane is much more suited than the 2dpph one for helium permeation and in the following we will focus on the former , analyzing in detail its separation capabilities .    in order to investigate the separation of helium from natural gas ,",
    "we have considered neon and methane as limiting cases of the complex mixture of alkanes and rare gases therein usually present .",
    "thus , additional accurate energy profiles are reported in fig . 2 ( upper panel ) and compared with that of helium .",
    "it should be pointed out that methane is considered as a pseudo - atom , so that the reported energy profile is actually an average of different potential curves(see supp .",
    "inf . and fig .",
    "we find that this approximation is reasonable since the collision time @xmath33 ( the average time taken to cross the barrier ) is about 2.5 times larger than the average ch@xmath0 rotational period , @xmath34 , for temperatures ranging from 100 to 300 k@xcite .",
    "we have found that the penetration barrier @xmath29 ( also reported in table 1 ) for ne and ch@xmath0 increases up to 0.106 and 1.460 ev , respectively , suggesting a high impediment to the passage of methane .      to assess the separation capability of the graphdiyne pores , we have computed transmission probabilities for the passage of these species by means of time - dependent wave packet simulations .",
    "a new force field , optimized on the benchmark mp2c electronic structure results , has been obtained to this end .",
    "it provides the basic features of the interaction in the full configuration space , and therefore it is suitable for performing molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "specifically , for describing the non - covalent interaction between the rare gas ( and methane in the pseudo - atom limit ) and the carbon atom forming the graphdiyne net structure the improved lennard - jones ( ilj ) pair potential function@xcite is used :    @xmath35 \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is a reduced pair distance @xmath37 , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the well depth and equilibrium distance of the rare gas(methane)-carbon interaction , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath40 is expressed by @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a parameter defining the shape of the potential and depending on the nature and hardness of the interacting partners .",
    "the optimized ilj parameters are reported in table 1 .",
    "they have a physical meaning , since they have been obtained by fine tuning initial data estimated by exploiting the polarizability values of the interacting partners . in the case of the graphdiyne pore , the average effective polarizability of the c atom has been used .",
    "in particular , a value equal to 1.1@xmath1 , consistent with that reported by gavezzotti@xcite describing the average behavior of c atom in various aliphatic and unsaturated molecules , has been adopted to estimate the dispersion energy contribution and the @xmath38 parameter associated to each rare gas ( methane)-c interacting pair ( see also ref .",
    "moreover , many - body effects have been also taken into account in the evaluation of the @xmath43 values according to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "additional mp2c energy curves for approaches of the atom ( molecule ) to different sites of the graphdiyne pore have been computed and taken into account ( see fig .",
    "3 ) in order to more extensively test the features of the involved force field . in the upper panel of fig . 2 ( and in fig .",
    "3 ) we present a comparison between mp2c and ilj curves and a very good agreement can be observed which confirms the reliability of the proposed force fields .    for simplicity",
    "we have just considered a one - dimensional transmission@xcite of the atom through the center of a graphdiyne pore , where the interaction potentials have been obtained by summing up ilj pair potentials between the atom ( molecule ) and the neighboring carbon atoms of a graphdiyne sheet until convergence .",
    "values of the penetration barriers obtained in this way are reported in table 1 .",
    "thermally weighted transmission probabilities @xmath20 have been computed and used to estimate selectivities of the different molecular combinations @xmath44 , defined as the probability ratios @xmath45 .",
    "the temperature dependence of these selectivities is presented in the lower panel of fig .",
    "2 . exceptionally high selectivities can be noticed for he / ch@xmath0 and ne / ch@xmath0 combinations in a wide range of temperatures and they are about 10@xmath46 and 10@xmath47 , respectively , at room temperature . as for the he",
    "/ ne combination , the corresponding selectivity is about 27 at room temperature , suggesting a less efficient capability for the separation of these species , but in any case larger than 6 , the value considered acceptable for industrial applications@xcite . it should be noticed that the predicted selectivities could be actually reduced if the lowering of the penetration barrier due to deformation of the pores is taken into account : for the heavier species the larger lowering is expected ( see fig .",
    "s1 ) even if we do not consider that this effect can alter significantly the very favourable he / ch@xmath0 and ne / ch@xmath0 probability ratios we have found .",
    "further effects due to the neglect of both the interaction and competition of single components in the gas mixtures are not expected to provide significant deviations@xcite in the obtained @xmath48 behavior at least around and above room temperature .",
    "our results clearly indicate that the combination of a very high he diffusion rate ( fig . 1 ) and very high he / ch@xmath0 and ne / ch@xmath0 selectivities ( fig .",
    "2 ) makes graphdiyne a very promising material for the separation of he and ne from the hydrocarbons contained in natural gas ( higher alkanes , also present in natural gas , are expected to have even smaller transmission probabilities due to their larger size ) . as a matter of fact , due to the very low he and ne concentrations in most of the natural gas reservoirs , very high selectivities ( about 1000@xcite ) are required .",
    "this stringent requirement is indeed largely overcome by present estimations and , to our knowledge , not achieved by the polymeric membranes proposed up to date ( corresponding selectivities are about 100@xcite ) .",
    "the high permeability that we have found for he - graphdiyne has encouraged us to study the possibility of separation of its isotopic variants .",
    "in particular , the separation of @xmath1he and @xmath2he could be achieved by taking advantage of slight differences in the tunneling probabilities of the two isotopes and by exploiting them in multistage processes@xcite , which involve the passage of the gas through a number of graphdiyne layers . to this end",
    "we have computed transmission probabilities for @xmath1he and @xmath2he as functions of kinetic energy .",
    "the results are given in the upper panel of fig .",
    "it can be seen that , for kinetic energies lower than the classical barrier ( see last column of table 1 ) , the @xmath1he transmission probability is significantly higher than that of @xmath2he , while the opposite occurs for higher kinetic energies . for this reason",
    ", it makes sense to keep the gas temperature as low as possible in order to exploit the low energy side of the transmission curve .",
    "thermally weighted transmission probabilities as well as the corresponding @xmath1he/@xmath2he selectivity as a function of temperature are reported in fig .",
    "4 ( lower panel ) .",
    "it should be stressed that , for simplicity , we have assumed a ( classical ) boltzmann distribution for kinetic energies of both isotopes instead of the intrinsic quantum statistics of fermionic @xmath1he and bosonic @xmath2he atoms .",
    "however , if a mixed nonideal quantum gas was considered , an even larger @xmath1he/@xmath2he selectivity would be expected since the fermi - dirac distribution is broader than the bose - einstein one . therefore",
    ", present estimation for the isotopic selectivity at 77 k ( liquid nitrogen temperature ) is about 1.04 and increases rapidly at low temperatures reaching the acceptable reference value of 6@xcite at about 20 k. however , as the temperature drops , the transmission probabilities considerably decrease , as well as the he flux .",
    "in fact at 20k the @xmath1he transmission probability , even if larger than that of @xmath2he and of the classical limit ( see lower panel of fig .",
    "4 ) , is quite low and in the range of 10@xmath49@xcite .",
    "the overall flux is the transmission probability multiplied by the frequency of gas collisions with the pore , which , according to the kinetic theory of gases , is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the pressure of the species , @xmath27 the temperature and @xmath52 the boltzmann constant .",
    "if we assume a 100@xmath25 porous sheet , ideal gas conditions and a pressure of 3 bar we can estimate an upper - bound@xcite of the total helium flux : at 77k it is about 3.7@xmath5310@xmath54 moles @xmath55 s@xmath32 while at 20k is about 1.5@xmath5310@xmath56 moles @xmath55 s@xmath32 , a value leading to a permeance@xcite equal to 1.5@xmath5310@xmath56 moles @xmath55 s@xmath32 bar @xmath32 which is slightly lower than the limit of 6.7@xmath5310@xmath56 moles @xmath55 s@xmath32 bar @xmath32@xcite considered acceptable for industrial applications .",
    "in summary , by means of electronic structure mp2c computations , we have shown that graphdiyne is much more suited than 2dpph for helium permeation since it involves a much lower penetration barrier ( of the order of few tens of mev ) .",
    "additional calculations of the interaction of neon and methane with a graphdiyne pore have allowed us to setup reliable full force fields which have been used to compute quantum mechanical probabilities and selectivities for the passage of gases through the openings .",
    "we have found exceptionally favorable he / ch@xmath0 and ne / ch@xmath0 selectivities in a wide range of temperatures which largely exceed the performance of the best membranes used for helium chemical separation .",
    "thermally weighted helium tunneling calculations have been also performed to show selective transmissions of @xmath1he versus @xmath2he . for temperatures below 100k",
    "the @xmath1he/@xmath2he selectivity becomes appreciably larger than 1 , reaching an acceptable value of 6 at about 20k .",
    "we thus propose that , in addition to its promise for hydrogen@xcite and water@xcite purification , a graphdiyne based membrane can be efficiently used for helium separation applications addressed to filtering natural gas and , possibly , isotopic mixtures . on the basis of present results , since species other than helium are assumed to provide penetration barriers whose values increase with their vdw diameter , we consider that graphdiyne pores should also provide favorable selectivities for he / ar , he / kr and he / n@xmath57 gas combinations which could permit optimal separation of helium from heavier rare gases and hydrothermal spring gases , the latter primarily composed of nitrogen@xcite .",
    "a full assessment of the capability of graphdiyne for helium isotopic separation would actually require three - dimensional simulations in order to better estimate the helium permeance at low temperatures and to take into account for zero - point energy effects due to in - pore vibrational modes .",
    "work in this direction , by using the ilj full force field , is in progress .",
