    "astrophysical reaction rates are central to tracing changes in the abundances of nuclei by nuclear reactions .",
    "they provide the temperature- and density - dependent coefficients entering reaction networks , the large sets of coupled differential equations required to study nucleosynthesis and energy generation in astrophysical environments .",
    "the reaction rates are computed from reaction cross sections which , in turn , may be predicted in theoretical models or extracted from experiments .",
    "in addition to the difficulties arising in the determination of the cross sections , the conversion to reaction rates is further complicated by modifications of the rates in a hot plasma and the fact that the rates of forward and reverse rate for the same reaction have to be consistent to ensure numerical stability and proper equilibrium abundances at high temperature .",
    "both issues can be addressed at once by accounting for the thermal population of target states which leads to _ stellar _ rates obeying a reciprocity relation between forward and reverse rate . using this reciprocity , knowledge of the rate in only one direction is needed because the other reaction direction can be directly computed from that rate , thus ensuring consistency .    for numerical reasons , further elaborated in sec .",
    "[ sec : sef ] , it is usually preferable to start from the rate of a reaction with positive reaction @xmath0 value when computing the rate for its inverse reaction .",
    "even more importantly , experimentalists want to determine rates as close as possible to the actual stellar rates , i.e.  rates with minimal thermal population effects of the target . again",
    ", it can be argued that this is the case for exothermic reactions .",
    "this led to the commonly applied rule that measurements of exothermic reactions are more important than those of endothermic ones . in this paper",
    "we show that there is a considerable number of reactions for which a suppression effect brings the stellar rate of an endothermic reaction closer to the laboratory value than its exothermic counterpart .    as an example of how to exploit this suppression effect and to obtain stellar rates from a measurement of an endothermic reaction",
    ", we experimentally studied the reaction @xmath1rb(p , n)@xmath1sr , having @xmath7 mev .",
    "the importance of the reaction is manifold . in the last several years a number of proton capture cross section measurements with relevance for @xmath8 process studies have been carried out ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . the @xmath8 process was shown to synthesize @xmath3 nuclides ( proton - rich isotopes not accessible to the @xmath9 and @xmath10 processes ) by a series of photodisintegrations of stable nuclides in hot layers of massive stars @xcite . recently , systematic @xmath8 process simulations found not only that photodisintegration reactions are important but also that ( p , n ) reactions , and in particular @xmath1rb(p , n)@xmath1sr , strongly influence the final @xmath3 abundances @xcite .",
    "additionally , this reaction is well suited to test the optical potential used for calculating the interaction between protons and target nuclei .",
    "we commence by outlining the theoretical background regarding stellar rates and the suppression effect in secs .",

    "the results of a large - scale study of the effect in the full extension of the nuclear chart are discussed in sec .",

    "a brief account of our findings was already given in @xcite .",
    "the present follow - up paper expands the discussion and also provides additional results in all parts of this investigation .",
    "the stellar enhancement factor ( sef ) @xmath11 is defined as the ratio of the stellar rate @xmath12 relative to the ground state rate @xmath13 @xcite @xmath14 the rate @xmath15 derived from cross sections @xmath16 measured in the laboratory is the same as @xmath13 because so far all experiments use target nuclei in their ground states .",
    "the sef is a measure of the influence of the thermally excited target states in the hot plasma .",
    "astrophysical reaction rates are usually defined as giving the number of a specific reaction occurring per time . here , we constrain ourselves to two - body reactions of nuclei and nucleons .",
    "the concept of the stellar rates suppression introduced below is easily extended to other reaction types .",
    "reaction cross sections are folded with the energy distribution of the interacting nuclei to obtain the reaction rate .",
    "the energy distributions of nuclei and nucleons in an astrophysical plasma follow maxwell - boltzmann distributions in most applications , thus yielding @xcite @xmath17 for reactions proceeding from target state @xmath18 with reaction cross section @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the number densities of the interacting nuclei , @xmath22 is the plasma temperature , @xmath23 denotes the boltzmann constant , and @xmath24 is a renormalization factor @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the reduced mass number @xmath27 .    when nuclei are in thermal equilibrium with their environment , their excited states are populated according to a boltzmann factor @xcite @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 denoting the relative population , spin , and excitation energy of state @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "each of the states is bombarded with maxwell - boltzmann distributed projectiles which would require to have a separate rate for each target state weighted by the population factor of the state @xmath18 from which the reaction proceeds .",
    "it was shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that by making use of the reciprocity theorem for nuclear reactions and detailed balance ( assuming thermalization of both initial and final states of a reaction ) , for compound reactions the rate equation can be simplified to @xmath32 in order to avoid additional computations caused by the population coefficients and also to avoid having a temperature dependent stellar cross section , the effective cross section @xmath33 was introduced above , which sums over all bound states in the initial _ and _ final system ( denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath34 , respectively ; the energetics of the transitions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff ] ) @xcite : @xmath35 this is a theoretical construct ( as any measurement would always proceed on a certain initial state and thus neglect the sum over target states ) but it is useful in two respects .",
    "firstly , it simplifies the computation of the rate and therefore is utilized in all _ astrophysical _ compound reaction codes .",
    "secondly , it allows us to easily find a reciprocity relation between forward and inverse rate by remembering that @xmath36 obeys reciprocity between forward and inverse reaction due to detailed balance .",
    "it should be noted that only _ stellar _",
    "reactivities @xmath37 ( and thus stellar rates @xmath38 obey reciprocity ( as long as detailed balance is applicable ) whereas rates derived from ground state cross sections @xmath39 do not , unless the sef is equal to unity in the given direction .    for reactions @xmath40 with target nucleus 1 , projectile 2 , final nucleus 3 , and ejectile 4 ,",
    "the relation between backward and forward stellar reactivity is given by @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the reaction @xmath0 value , @xmath43 denote ground state spins , and @xmath44 are nuclear partition functions summing over states @xmath18 and integrating over a level density @xmath45 above the last discrete state @xmath46 included @xcite : @xmath47 this partition function also appears in eq .",
    "[ eq : simprate ] where it is sufficient to compute it once and separately from the rate integration .",
    "stellar capture reactions @xmath48 are related to stellar photodisintegration by @xcite @xmath49      figure [ fig : eff ] shows a sketch of the energetically allowed transitions included in the effective cross section defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : effcs ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that there are more transitions possible to and from states of the nucleus being the final nucleus in a reaction with positive @xmath0 value .",
    "therefore , assuming a similar level structure in all involved nuclei , it is expected that the sef ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : sef ] ) of a given reaction will be smaller for the exothermic direction @xmath50 than for the endothermic one @xmath51 ( here we define the forward reaction to be the one with positive @xmath0 value and the reverse reaction having negative @xmath0 value ) : @xmath52 this is especially pronounced in photodisintegration reactions due to the many possible @xmath8 transitions @xcite . in consequence , aiming at performing a measurement as close as possible to the stellar value , an exothermic reaction should be chosen .",
    "another impact of the @xmath0 value is found by inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : revrate ] ) and ( [ eq : invphot ] ) where the @xmath0 value appears in an exponential .",
    "for numerical consistency and to obtain proper equilibrium abundances when forward and reverse reaction are both fast and in equilibrium , reaction network codes avoid employing separate rates for the two directions but rather make use of these equations .",
    "taking an endothermic reaction as starting point for application of the equations would lead to a large value of the exponential term , amplifying any numerical errors inherent in the original rate and in the @xmath0 value .",
    "this is mainly important when dealing with rate fits . in many astrophysical reaction network codes ,",
    "the rates are implemented not as large tables but as fits with a smaller number of parameters per reaction .",
    "any deficiency in the fit would be amplified when computing an exothermic rate from an endothermic one .    for the above reasons , it was commonly assumed that it is always preferable to determine the cross section and rate of an exothermic reaction and not those of an endothermic one . here",
    ", we want to correct that notion by showing that there are cases for which @xmath53 the basic idea is to realize that although there are more transitions energetically possible to the final states of exothermic reactions , some of them may be suppressed and thus not contributing . of course , it is obvious that not all transitions are of equal strength .",
    "quantum mechanical spin and parity selection rules and centrifugal barriers ( or lack thereof ) may prefer certain transitions over others .",
    "this will be important in reactions with small @xmath54 and in nuclei with large level spacings . in both cases ,",
    "only a small number of transitions will be possible and the spins can give larger weight to an even smaller subset .",
    "however , for reactions with sizeable @xmath0 values or involving nuclei with high level densities this suppression due to spins will not be sufficient because there will always be a number of states with matching spins .",
    "transitions to higher lying excited states of a nucleus proceed at lower relative energy . except for s - wave neutrons , also transitions at lower relative energy will be weaker than those at larger relative energy . if the suppression of transitions with smaller relative energy is different in the entrance and exit channel of the reaction , this may also result in @xmath55 .",
    "the strongest suppression for charged particles is due to the coulomb barrier . having different coulomb barriers in the entrance and exit channel , e.g. in ( n",
    ", p ) or ( p,@xmath4 ) reactions , can more strongly suppress the transitions to the nucleus with higher coulomb barrier than to the one with lower coulomb barrier .",
    "with respect to fig .",
    "[ fig : eff ] and assuming , e.g. , a reaction a(n,@xmath4)f this means that most transitions to states in nucleus f are suppressed and the contributing transitions may be fewer than those accessing states in nucleus a.    this coulomb suppression of the sef is a general principle almost independent of nuclear structure and will act for a large range of nuclei . whether the suppression is strong enough to yield @xmath55",
    "depends on the size of the @xmath0 value relative to the coulomb barrier , i.e. the effect can occur in a reaction provided that there are different coulomb barriers in the entrance and exit channel and @xmath56 is low compared to the coulomb barrier .",
    "the strongest impact is to be expected when the forward reaction involves neutrons in the entrance channel which form a compound state by s - waves on excited target states and charged particles experiencing a high coulomb barrier in the exit channel . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : astrorate ] the reaction @xmath1rb(p , n)@xmath1sr is an excellent example for such a case .",
    "a quantitative exploration of the suppression effect across the nuclear chart is given in the following section .",
    "not only theoretically interesting , this coulomb suppression effect is also important for experiments because it allows to directly determine an astrophysically relevant rate by measuring in the direction of suppressed sef . the above mentioned complication of fitting rates with negative @xmath0 values can be circumvented by directly applying detailed balance and numerically computing the rate for the forward reaction before performing a fit .",
    "this is possible when @xmath57 .",
    "subsequently , fits for both rates can be obtained in the standard way . as an example , an application of this procedure to the rate of @xmath1rb(p , n)@xmath1sr is shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : astrorate ] .      in this section ,",
    "we quantitatively study the sef suppression introduced and discussed in the previous section .",
    "using non - smoker results @xcite we compared @xmath50 and @xmath51 for reactions involving light projectiles ( nucleons , @xmath4 ) and targets from ne to bi between the proton and neutron driplines . to avoid trivial cases , only reactions with @xmath58",
    "are considered .",
    "furthermore , the sef were computed for @xmath59 gk to find cases important in most nucleosynthesis environments and to eliminate cases only occurring at high temperature .",
    "because of our aim to provide guidance for experiments , we further only focus on examples with @xmath60 .",
    "even with these restrictions we find 1200 reactions exhibiting such a strong suppression effect that @xmath55 .    to check the dependence on the coulomb barrier , fig .",
    "[ fig : qdep ] shows the obtained range of @xmath0 values still yielding @xmath55 as a function of target charge @xmath61 for ( p , n ) and ( @xmath4,n ) reactions with negative @xmath0 values . it can be clearly seen that larger maximal @xmath56 is allowed with increasing charge @xmath61 . the different increase in",
    "permitted maximal @xmath56 is different for the two reactions , reflecting the difference in the height of the acting coulomb barriers .",
    "below each maximally allowed @xmath56 for each given charge , there is a range of other values .",
    "this scatter is mainly caused by the available @xmath0 values ( as defined by the masses of the nuclei ) and not by other effects such as spins and parities of the involved nuclei .",
    "although the strengths of the involved transitions also depend on spin and parity of the initial and final state , coulomb repulsion dominates the suppression when the interaction energy is small , as it is the case for astrophysically relevant energies .",

    "[ eq : rate ] directly with the experimental cross sections already yields the stellar rate because the sef is small in the ( p , n ) direction .",
    "the stellar rate of the exothermic ( n , p ) reaction can then be computed using eq .",

    "our data covers an energy range sufficient to compute the rates between 2 and 4 gk . because of the excellent agreement of theory with experiment ( using the newly modified potential of @xcite ) , we supplement the data with the theoretical values to compute the reactivities at lower and higher temperatures , applying the same errors as for the data .    it is to be noted that fits of the rates should be obtained by first fitting the ( n , p ) rate and then deriving the ( p , n ) rate fit by modifying the fit coefficients according to detailed balance as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : revrate ] ) ( see @xcite for details ) . for convenience ,",

    "below 2 gk , the new reactivity is @xmath81% lower than previously .",
    "the change in the temperature dependence is due to the different proton optical potential used . at very low temperature",

    "we showed that  contrary to common wisdom  a large number of endothermic reactions exhibit smaller stellar enhancement than their exothermic counterparts and are thus preferable for experimental studies .",
    "the main cause of suppression of the sef in an endothermic reaction is the coulomb suppression of transitions with low relative energy .",
    "this coulomb suppression of the sef was found to act for reactions with @xmath82 but low @xmath56 and charged projectiles . allowing only nucleons , @xmath4 particles , and photons as projectiles or ejectiles , and restricting the results to experimentally useful values of the sefs",
