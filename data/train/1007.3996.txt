    "quantum field theories on curved spacetimes are of immense physical importance in many circumstances , for example in deriving the predictions of inflationary cosmology or in understanding the semi - classical physics of black holes .",
    "historically , much of our understanding of curved - spacetime quantum field theory has been based on a study of free fields . already in this context",
    "one encounters interesting physical issues such as the definition of the vacuum state and particle production due to spacetime curvature , cf . , @xcite .",
    "while there has been some work extending this to perturbative studies of weakly coupled field theories , direct studies of strongly coupled field theories pose technical and conceptual challenges .    in the context of cosmological evolution , one could readily envision the importance of understanding the dynamics of strongly interacting field theories on cosmological backgrounds .",
    "in fact , as we now explain , there is good reason to believe that qualitatively new phenomena arise in such theories , and that some of these phenomena might indeed be relevant for the physics of the early universe .    as an example , consider the case of de sitter spacetime , characterized by a hubble parameter @xmath1 which parameterizes the rate of accelerated expansion . from studies of free field theory in de sitter space , it is well known that an observer moving along a timelike geodesic observes a thermal bath of particles at temperature @xmath2 if the corresponding ( free ) field is in its de sitter - invariant vacuum state @xcite .",
    "this thermal behaviour is intimately associated with the cosmological horizon seen by the observer .",
    "while this resembles the thermal character of black hole horizons , there is a crucial difference : the cosmological horizon is observer - dependent .",
    "nevertheless , we can associate a temperature to de sitter spacetime and one should therefore consider local quantum theory residing on this background to be in an appropriate density matrix inside any horizon .    a natural question that we can then ask is the following : consider interacting field theories which ( in minkowski space ) exhibit multiple phases at non - zero temperatures , and undergo phase transitions as their temperature is increased or decreased past some critical value @xmath3 .",
    "when such theories are coupled to a background de sitter metric , can a change in the cosmological scale - and thus a change in @xmath4 - produce a similar phase transition ?",
    "specifically , one might expect to find a phase transition as we vary @xmath1 past a critical value where @xmath5 .",
    "we should emphasize that while plausible , the existence of such phase transitions is by no means obvious . in the de sitter background , the temperature @xmath6 and the curvature scale @xmath7 ( which is inversely proportional to the hubble constant @xmath1 ) are linked by @xmath8 , which implies that one can not easily disentangle the effects of curvature from thermal effects . indeed",
    ", the state of the field theory in a curved background like de sitter could be quite different from the state at the same nominal temperature in minkowski space ( where we have the best developed intuition for various phases ) .",
    "it is therefore a nontrivial question whether in the context of inflationary cosmology `` thermal '' phase transitions can occur dynamically as the acceleration of the universe changes .    in this paper",
    ", our approach will be to study this question using holographic gauge / gravity duality @xcite .",
    "specifically , we consider field theories which may be studied using a gravity dual and which exhibit a confined phase at low temperatures and a deconfined phase at high temperatures . using holographic methods , we can ask whether these theories also exhibit deconfinement as the acceleration is increased on a de sitter background .",
    "the confining gauge theories we are interested in are defined by scherk - schwarz compactification of cfts on a circle , so the study of these theories in de sitter spacetime is equivalent to a holographic study of cfts on @xmath9 .",
    "fortunately , this system has been considered in detail before , with the relevant dual gravity solutions derived and discussed ( including some comments about possible field theory interpretation ) in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the work @xcite emphasized that such theories indeed exhibit phase transitions as the ratio between de sitter radius and @xmath10 radius is varied , and that small @xmath11 and large @xmath11 phases exhibit properties of a hadronized phase and a plasma phase , respectively . interpreting these results in terms of our confining gauge theory ( i.e. the cft on a fixed - size @xmath10 ) ,",
    "they confirm our expectations that there is a phase transition at a critical value of the de sitter acceleration , and strongly suggest that this phase transition is associated with deconfinement . on the other hand ,",
    "we show that the transition does not occur when the de sitter temperature @xmath6 equals the minkowski space transition temperature @xmath3 , but rather at a lower temperature @xmath12 .    in order to relate the the de sitter transition to the minkowski space deconfinement transition more directly",
    ", we note that it is useful to consider varying the field theory temperature @xmath13 and the hubble parameter @xmath14 independently .",
    "previous work focused on field theory states defined on global de sitter space , implying the restriction @xmath15 .",
    "however , by working in the static patch of de sitter , we will be able to decouple the field theory temperature from the hubble constant and thus to provide evidence that the large @xmath15 phase is indeed continuously connected to the deconfined plasma in minkowski space in the @xmath13-@xmath1 phase diagram ( see figure ) .    since @xmath16 provides a dimensionless parameter that is physically relevant even for conformal field theories ,",
    "it is also interesting to study conformal theories on static patch de sitter as a function of this ratio . for cfts with gravity duals",
    ", we are able to perform this analysis quite explicitly , though we do not find any phase transitions as @xmath16 is varied .",
    "[ [ methodology - and - outline ] ] methodology and outline : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we remind the reader that gauge / gravity duality relates dynamics of strongly coupled ( non - gravitational ) conformal field theories to the dynamics of string theory or gravity on the class of asymptotically locally ads spacetimes .",
    "typically , this has been employed to study strongly coupled conformal field theories on minkowski space or on the einstein static universe ( esu ) .",
    "however , it is also possible to use the duality to study certain non - conformal field theories on more general spacetimes , including cosmological backgrounds such as de sitter spacetime .    the key ingredient we will use is that when we consider a conformal field theory on a non - dynamical background spacetime @xmath17 , the gauge / gravity correspondence maps the problem in a suitable limit to dynamics of pure gravity in an asymptotically locally ads spacetime @xmath18 .",
    "this bulk spacetime manifold has as its conformal boundary @xmath19 on which we will pick our chosen metric @xmath20 .",
    "the states of the cft are then dual to bulk geometries @xmath18 with these boundary conditions .",
    "when more than one such spacetime represents an equilibrium state at a given temperature @xmath13 , the cft has multiple phases .",
    "this set - up has recently been exploited to analyze the behaviour of strongly coupled field theories in black hole backgrounds @xcite . in these papers",
    "the aim was to understand the key features of hawking radiation of strongly coupled quanta .",
    "the problem at hand is simpler since we wish to understand the dynamics in de sitter spacetime which has more symmetry than a black hole background , and at least in some cases one is able to find the dual gravity solutions of interest quite explicitly .    to facilitate the discussion we will concentrate on two distinct classes of theories .",
    "we first describe the behaviour of strongly coupled conformal field theories on ds@xmath21 which are somewhat simpler to analyze .",
    "subsequently , we turn to confining theories on ; the field theories in question are obtained via scherk - schwarz compactification of higher dimensional field theories and we describe how they might undergo a confinement - deconfinement phase transition as we vary the background cosmological constant .",
    "after a brief review of some relevant properties of de sitter spacetime in , we warm up in by using ads / cft techniques to study the physics of conformal field theories on de sitter spacetime .",
    "for the de sitter - invariant vacuum state in a cft ( whose correlation functions are obtained by analytic continuation from correlation function on the sphere ) there can be no interesting dependence on the hubble parameter , since @xmath1 provides the only scale in the problem .",
    "therefore one expects no interesting phase transitions when we consider cft on global ds spacetime",
    ".    however , as we will explain in detail , within the static patch of ds spacetime we can study field theories in thermal states corresponding to temperatures @xmath13 different than the de sitter temperature @xmath6 . these states will be singular on the global ds spacetime , but that singularity will be hidden behind the cosmological horizon of the static patch .",
    "indeed while the existence of such states is clear for free field theories , we will show that they in fact also make sense for strongly coupled cfts .",
    "in particular , we find a one - parameter family of regular dual gravity solutions corresponding to conformal field theories at arbitrary values of the dimensionless combination @xmath16 .",
    "these interpolate between the solution dual to the cft at finite temperature on minkowski space and the solution dual to the ds spacetime cft in the de sitter vacuum state . using the dual gravity solutions",
    ", we calculate the stress - energy tensor in the field theory for general @xmath13 and @xmath1 .",
    "this stress tensor will be divergent on the cosmological horizon for all values of @xmath22 but will be manifestly regular when the temperature of the static patch coincides with the ds temperature .",
    "the gravitational dual solutions of these field theories are interesting in their own right - they are completely smooth and have a regular killing horizon with constant surface gravity .",
    "the surface gravity is in fact related to the temperature of the field theory @xmath13 . at the same time",
    "this bulk killing horizon asymptotically approaches the boundary de sitter horizon ( of the static patch ) , which has associated temperature @xmath6 . while classical gravity solutions with multiple killing horizons at different temperatures are common ( the schwarzschild de sitter spacetime being a prime example ) , we have here a unique situation where the bulk spacetime horizon has a different temperature from the horizon in the boundary despite the fact that the two are continuously connected",
    ".    having gained intuition from our analysis of cfts , we turn in to the more interesting case of confining gauge theory on de sitter space . while one would ideally like to consider a confining gauge theory like qcd on ds for physical interest , one is stymied by the absence of a holographic dual for qcd . to obtain a confining gauge theory that can be studied using holographic methods",
    ", we consider a conformal field theory compactified on a circle with anti - periodic boundary conditions for fermions ( i.e. scherk - schwarz compactification )",
    ". as we will review , the resulting lower - dimensional theory is confining , and in particular , undergoes a deconfinement phase transition at a temperature of order the kaluza - klein scale .",
    "thus , to study confining gauge theory on , one need only study conformal field theory on @xmath23 . the scale of confinement is simply the radius @xmath24 of the @xmath10 , and we will keep this fixed as we vary the hubble parameter of the de sitter space .",
    "the equilibrium state of the field theory for a given @xmath1 is the state dual to the asymptotically locally geometry whose boundary geometry is @xmath23 . as noted in @xcite following earlier work @xcite , it is easy to see using the euclidean picture that one indeed has a non - trivial phase transition in this set - up .",
    "since the euclidean continuation is an ads spacetime with boundary @xmath25 , this is nothing but the familiar hawking - page transition @xcite .",
    "the current set - up is simply a double wick rotation of the situation discussed in @xcite ; one starts with @xmath25 and analytically continues the @xmath26 into in contrast to the usual hawking - page story where one analytically continues the @xmath10 to obtain a lorentzian spacetime .",

    "subsequently , @xcite noted that the topological ads black hole of @xcite also has the same boundary .",
    "these disparate pieces were put together in @xcite who used the two distinct bulk solutions to investigate the behaviour of the @xmath31-vacua in de sitter spacetime for strongly coupled theories . in particular , it was argued that the @xmath31-vacua are unphysical since they would require additional singularities at anti - podally related points on the black hole horizon for green s functions .",
    "the bubble of nothing and the topological black hole spacetimes were further investigated in @xcite with an aim towards understanding the vacuum stability .",
    "it was argued that the bubbles of nothing mediate a semi - classical decay of the topological black hole spacetime , for small enough temperatures .",

    "@xcite provided evidence that the bubble of nothing phase is characterized by gapped hadronic excitations , while the baados black hole phase should be interpreted as a plasma .",

    "the temperature is thus fixed and we have chosen normalizations so that it is given by @xmath13 , independent of @xmath1 , as we hoped to achieve with our construction .",
    "a plot of the bulk horizon is shown in .",
    "coordinates used to express the solution as a solid black line .",
    "the static patch of de sitter is restricted to @xmath94 and this is the relevant region of the spacetime even in the bulk .",
    "the shaded region lies inside the horizon in the bulk geometry . ]",
    "independent of the explicit construction sketched in we can argue as follows that such a solution must exist .",
    "the static patch of ( for any value of @xmath1 ) is conformally related to minkowski space @xmath95 as both are ( conformally ) diamonds .",
    "in fact , since minkowski space is scale - invariant , it is clear that we can take them to be conformally related by a conformal factor that is a ) independent of time @xmath47 and b ) equal to 1 at @xmath40 for all @xmath47 .",
    "such a conformal transformation maps the timelike killing field @xmath51 of minkowski space to the usual static patch killing field @xmath96 of ( with the standard normalization ) .",
    "suppose one starts with in the btz coordinates , where the boundary is ( two copies of ) minkowski space and the solution is periodic in euclidean time with period @xmath97 ( which is related to the btz parameter ) . the above mentioned change of conformal frame maps @xmath98 to the static patch of , but",
    "since it maps the timelike killing fields properly @xmath99 , it follows that the euclidean period still remains @xmath97 .",
    "one thus obtains a solution with boundary hubble constant @xmath1 and temperature @xmath13 . though the construction is slightly different in form , this solution coincides with the one derived differently in .",
    "given the explicit solution , it is easy to evaluate the expectation value of the stress tensor .",
    "this is done by computing the quasi - local brown - york stress tensor using the standard ads / cft dictionary @xcite . for our purposes",
    "it is convenient to derive the boundary stress tensor for the configuration using the fefferman - graham expansion .",
    "the bulk metric @xmath100 is already in the fefferman - graham gauge ; all we need to do is to expand the metric at a constant @xmath101 slice , call it @xmath102 , in a taylor series expansion in @xmath101 with coefficients @xmath103 . given this expansion say in the form @xmath104 the holographic stress tensor is @xcite : @xmath105 where of course @xmath106 is the metric @xmath107 on the boundary and @xmath108 is proportional the boundary central charge .",

    "also note that the stress tensor is not traceless ; this is simply a manifestation of the conformal anomaly in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "in addition it is also useful to see that the result nicely interpolates between the stress tensor on de sitter at @xmath6 and the result for a theory in minkowski space at temperature @xmath13 .",
    "finally , we note that our solution is unique for all values of @xmath112 , indicating that there are no phase transitions for any value of @xmath78 .",
    "having discussed the simple example of 1 + 1 dimensional cfts , we now turn to higher dimensional cfts in spacetimes .",
    "once again it is easy to write down the holographic dual for the cft on global de sitter spacetime .",
    "the euclidean geometry is again uniquely determined to be in order to maintain full @xmath43 invariance .",
    "the bulk spacetime metric takes the form : @xmath113 one can again transform this into the static coordinates and recover the holographic dual for cfts at @xmath114 .    in order to consider cfts at temperatures differing from @xmath76 one",
    "needs a bit more work .",
    "the situation in a 2 + 1 dimensional bulk was somewhat special in that all negatively curved einstein three manifolds are diffeomorphic to .",
    "therefore the problem of finding three dimensional bulk geometries with specified 1 + 1 dimensional boundaries reduces to finding an appropriate diffeomorphism , which is a simpler ( albeit not necessarily trivial ) problem .",
    "for higher dimensional examples one does not have this luxury . a - priori it appears as though one has to solve a co - homogeniety two system of partial differential equations to determine the appropriate bulk geometry , since the boundary metric has only manifest @xmath115 isometry .",
    "happily , this complication can be circumvented and the desired bulk spacetimes can be found explicitly using the weyl rescaling idea sketched in . the basic idea is the following : we note that the static patch of is conformal to the lorentzian hyperbolic cylinder @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the euclidean hyperboloid ( i.e. , euclidean ads ) . moreover , the static killing field @xmath51 of de sitter maps to the static killing field of the hyperbolic cylinder as can be see by writing : @xmath118 and performing the coordinate change @xmath119 . therefore ,",
    "if one has the holographic duals for the hyperbolic cylinder with euclidean time period given by @xmath97 with @xmath120 , then by the above described weyl rescaling one can immediately construct the duals for the static patch of with @xmath59 ( or equivalently for the boundary euclidean manifold @xmath63 ) .",
    "fortunately , such solutions are indeed known ; these are the hyperbolic ( also referred to sometimes as topological ) black holes described in @xcite . in addition , it was argued in @xcite that these are the unique solutions with the desired symmetries and thus that there are no phase transitions for the dual gauge theory on @xmath116 .",
    "it follows that there are again no phase transitions on de sitter as a function of @xmath78 .",
    "the metric for the hyperbolic black hole geometries takes the form : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the metric on the euclidean hyperboloid .",
    "this bulk @xmath123 dimensional spacetime has a horizon at the zero locus of @xmath124 and the corresponding euclidean solution will be regular provided @xmath125 given this hyperbolic black hole , all we need to do is perform a diffeomorphism in the bulk that acts as a boundary conformal transformation , achieving the mapping indicated in .",
    "this is easily done for instance by defining @xmath126 which results in the metric @xmath127 we claim that are the bulk geometries appropriate to describe the dynamics of cfts on the static patch of at temperature @xmath13 given by , which in general differs from the de sitter temperature @xmath6 .",
    "of course , for the particular case @xmath128 , the metric differs from only by a simple coordinate change .    having identified the relevant holographic dual geometries we are in a position to answer physical questions about the dynamics of cfts at @xmath22 on the static patch of .",
    "the simplest observable one can extract from the holographic dual is the quantum expectation value of the stress tensor .",
    "as described in one can compute this by using the holographic prescription of @xcite .",
    "fortunately , our task is simplified for the case of odd dimensional de sitter spacetimes ( @xmath33 odd ) since one can obtain the result by following the conformal transformation .",
    "first of all note that the boundary stress tensor for the hyperbolic black hole has been previously determined in @xcite : @xmath129 where @xmath130 and vanishes for odd @xmath33 .",
    "we then note that under a weyl rescaling of the metric @xmath131 the stress tensor transforms as @xmath132 .",
    "this suffices to explicitly determine the boundary stress tensor for cfts on for odd @xmath33  in particular , we find the following stress tensor on the static patch of de sitter with temperature @xmath13 in terms of the central charge @xmath133 ) of the cft : and the hubble scale @xmath1 .",

    ", the above expression does not capture the conformal anomaly .",
    "one then indeed has to use the covariant formalism of boundary stress tensor or transform to fefferman - graham coordinates to extract the expectation value of the stress tensor .",

    "thus far we have concentrated on the behaviour of conformal field theories ( with ads duals ) on de sitter spacetime . however , even working in the static patch at temperatures @xmath59 , we have seen that the phase structure of such theories is trivial . as a result",
    ", these states do not quite address our original motivation : investigating phase transitions induced by cosmological evolution .",
    "thus , we now turn to the task of exhibiting a holographic cosmological phase transition .",
    "ideally one would like to take a phenomenologically relevant theory like qcd and examine its behaviour as one varies the background acceleration .",
    "this being a slightly ambitious task , we will instead address a simpler problem which nevertheless captures much of the basic physics .",
    "the idea is to consider a field theory with gravity dual that exhibits a deconfinement transition in minkowski spacetime , and check whether this theory also exhibits a transition at a critical value of @xmath1 on de sitter spacetime . for the theories we consider , the necessary de sitter analysis was already carried out in @xcite ( and earlier work ) and indicates that there is indeed a phase transition at a critical value of @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , we find that this critical value corresponds to a de sitter temperature @xmath4 _ lower _ than that of the associated phase transition in flat spacetime .      in order to study the phase structure of a confining gauge theory on de sitter , we first need a field theory with confined and deconfined phases that in addition has a holographic dual .",
    "the simplest such theories were described in @xcite and are realized as a scherk - schwarz compactification of a cft on @xmath10 .",
    "the scherk - schwarz boundary conditions are that the fermions in the theory be anti - periodic around the @xmath10 .",
    "to set the stage for our discussion we will first quickly review the physics of these theories on minkowski spacetime .",
    "one useful aspect of such scherk - schwarz compactifications of cfts is that one has a geometric picture of confinement : the bulk manifold dual to the theory in the confined phase smoothly caps off in the bulk effectively producing an ir end to the dual spacetime . gauge theory ( or equivalently large central charge @xmath142 cft ) prior to the scherk - schwarz compactification .",
    "this in particular , implies that the confined phase will have @xmath143 free energy while the deconfined phase will have @xmath144 free energy , which we take to be the basic order parameter for the confinement / deconfinement transition . ]",
    "generally , a @xmath123-dimensional cft on @xmath35 has a conformally invariant vacuum state which via the gauge / gravity duality , corresponds to a dual gravitational background : @xmath145 where @xmath146 .",
    "now , we can consider the field theory compactified on @xmath147 by taking the @xmath148 direction compact with size @xmath149 .",
    "while one might think that the gravity dual is simply given by periodically identifying @xmath148 in with period @xmath150 , it turns out the true vacuum state of the field theory is instead given by the ads - soliton geometry @xcite whose metric takes the form : @xmath151 where @xmath152 as long as we take @xmath153 the solution smoothly caps off at @xmath154 . at this point , the circle parametrized by @xmath148 pinches off , so the @xmath148 and @xmath155 directions form a cigar - type geometry .",
    "this pinching off is consistent provided we have anti - periodic boundary conditions for fermions on the circle . as explained in detail in @xcite",
    "this solution has lower action when compared to , and therefore represents the vacuum state of the field theory .",
    "the fact that the solution has an ir end implies that the corresponding field theory is confining ( i.e. , the gap in the spectrum can indeed be directly related to the capping off of the spacetime ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that confining field theories defined in this way undergo a deconfinement transition at a critical temperature @xmath156 the equilibrium state of the field theory at temperature @xmath13 may be analyzed by considering the euclidean geometries with boundary behavior as above , but with the euclidean time compactified on a circle of size @xmath157 with anti - periodic boundary conditions for fermions .",
    "one solution with these boundary conditions is the simple analytic continuation of the solution , @xmath158 and to take @xmath54 periodic with period @xmath97 .",
    "however , since @xmath54 and @xmath148 are now on the same footing ( they are compact directions with anti - periodic boundary conditions for fermions ) it is clear that we can obtain another solution by the replacements @xmath159 and simultaneously exchanging @xmath160 .",
    "the solution thus obtained has lower action when @xmath161 ( i.e. when the @xmath54 circle is smaller than the @xmath148 circle ) , so we have a phase transition at the critical temperature @xmath3 defined above .    back in lorentzian spacetime ,",

    "the horizon is located at @xmath165 , and corresponds to a deconfined phase of the field theory ( e.g. the polyakov loop has a non - zero expectation value since the temporal circle is contractible in the euclidean picture @xcite ) .",
    "having described a class of confining gauge theories that can be studied using ads / cft , one would like to investigate the physics of these theories on de sitter spacetime .",
    "since the field theories were defined as conformal field theories on @xmath10 , the same field theories on ds spacetime correspond to conformal field theories on @xmath166 . using the basic ads / cft dictionary explained at the beginning of",
    ", such theories should be described by the dual gravitational theory on an asymptotically locally ads spacetime whose boundary geometry is @xmath166 .",
    "while the circle and the ds spacetime both have a characteristic length scale that can be varied , physical observables only depend on the ratio of these , since the original field theory is conformal . in the language of the confining gauge theory",
    ", the physics depends only on how large the hubble parameter @xmath1 is compared with the confinement scale @xmath167 .",
    "in general , as discussed earlier , for a quantum field theory on de sitter spacetime , the de sitter - invariant equilibrium state for a given @xmath1 can be obtained by analytically continuing the euclidean vacuum state on the round sphere . for the current case of interest ,",
    "the relevant euclidean field theory is then a cft on @xmath168 .",

    "it remains only to write down the euclidean solutions and to wick rotate them to lorentzian solutions with de sitter boundaries .",
    "this construction is well - described in @xcite and references therein .",
    "we will therefore restrict ourselves to a general review these geometries .      parameterizing the @xmath10 by a coordinate @xmath171 with period @xmath172 , the two ( euclidean )",
    "solutions of interest are given as : @xmath173 the function @xmath124 is what determines the nature of the solution and its regime of dominance .",
    "the solution which has lower action for a large @xmath45 , i.e. , for small @xmath174 is the euclidean schwarzschild- black hole for which : @xmath175 this solution has topology @xmath176 for the @xmath177 smoothly contracts to a point as @xmath178 provided one chooses @xmath179 on the other hand the @xmath45 size remains finite everywhere in the spacetime .",

    "note that the solutions where the @xmath10 contracts smoothly in the interior of the spacetime exist only for a range of the radius of the scherk - schwarz circle .",
    "in particular , from we learn that @xmath183 moreover , the relation between @xmath24 and @xmath184 is double - valued ; for a given value of @xmath24 we have two different choices of @xmath184 which translates to two distinct solutions .",
    "on the contrary the second set of solutions where the @xmath45 shrinks to zero size at @xmath185 ( smoothly ) exist for all values of @xmath24 .",
    "the wick rotation of the euclidean black holes gives the ads bubble of nothing solutions of @xcite and the wick rotation of thermal ads gives the baados black hole @xcite .",
    "the baados black hole dominates at large @xmath29 while the bubble of nothing dominates at small @xmath186 to determine which of the solutions dominates the euclidean quantum gravity path integral , one needs to compute the on - shell action .",

    "more specifically , the critical ratio of circle radius to sphere radius @xmath190 in the boundary geometry for which the transition occurs is given by @xmath191 in terms of the parameters in the metric above , this translates to @xmath192 in terms of the de sitter temperature @xmath4 and the critical temperature @xmath3 for the minkowski space phase transition , we have @xmath193 perhaps surprisingly , the transition occurs when the de sitter temperature is lower by a factor of @xmath33 than the critical temperature in minkowski space !",
    "having seen the euclidean description of confining theories on de sitter , we now return to discussing the lorentzian geometry and investigate the properties of the two solutions , with the function @xmath124 being given by and respectively .",

    "the existence of a bubble of nothing is quite natural : the spacetime has to cap off in the ir , and if the geometry on which the field theory lives is quite flat relative to the qcd scale , one might expect that the full spacetime to look like a  thickened \" version of the boundary .",

    "the solution with lower euclidean action takes the same form as in , but now we take @xmath124 as given by the second solution above .",
    "this solution has a horizon at @xmath182 , so immediately , we see that it shares one feature with the deconfined solution ( [ decon ] ) .",
    "however , the nature of the horizon is somewhat different , since the entire de sitter factor in the metric goes to zero at this point .",
    "one might worry about the regularity of the spacetime here , but in fact the spacetime is non - singular at this horizon and is in fact just the topological ads black hole discovered by baados @xcite .",
    "we review some aspects of this in for completeness .",
    "our discussion so far considers states defined on global de sitter , thus imposing the restriction @xmath197 .",
    "it is interesting to remove this restriction and to consider the theory in the static patch of de sitter for @xmath22 . in particular ,",
    "we wish to prove that the phase transition described above and studied in @xcite for confining theories on de sitter is continuously connected to the analogous transition for the same theory on flat space .    with @xmath198 one",
    "can consider more generally the phase diagram for our theory on a static patch of de sitter spacetime , as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath1 ( as discussed in , and ) .",
    "for our confining theory in a regime where the theory has a weakly - curved dual gravity description , the equilibrium phase for a general @xmath13 and @xmath1 is related to the minimum - action euclidean geometry satisfying einstein s equations with negative cosmological constant and boundary geometry @xmath199 ( see for the definition of @xmath60 ) .",
    "this defines a family of euclidean geometries depending on two parameters : the angle @xmath171 which encodes the temperature , and the curvature of the @xmath45 , which encodes the acceleration parameter .",
    "the topology of the associated euclidean solution provides an order parameter that divides the @xmath13-@xmath1 phase diagram into at least two parts .",
    "the region for which the associated euclidean solution has topology @xmath176 contains both the low - temperature minkowski phase and the low - acceleration de sitter phase , while the topology @xmath181 region contains both the high - temperature minkowski phase and the high - acceleration de sitter phase .",
    "thus , the former two phases are cleanly distinguished from the latter two phases by an order parameter .",
    "further , it is clear that the low - acceleration de sitter phase is smoothly connected to the confined phase of the dual theory on flat space .",
    "this follows since in the @xmath44 limit the dual gravity solution in the low - acceleration de sitter phase goes smoothly into the solution dual to the minkowski - space confined phase .",
    "thus it is certainly correct to identify the @xmath200 phase in ds spacetime with the minkowski space confined phase .",
    "it remains to show that the euclidean solution corresponding to the high - acceleration de sitter phase smoothly connected by a change in parameters to the deconfined phase in minkowski space . to do this",

    "note that for the confining theory on @xmath201 , the bulk solution , has very similar properties to those associated to deconfined phases on minkowski space @xcite , namely the @xmath181 topology and the presence of the black hole horizon .",

    "the diagram assumes the absence of phase transitions other than the thick dashed line representing a change in topology of the dual euclidean solution from @xmath176 to @xmath181 .",

    "the rest of this section is devoted to providing some modest evidence that a high - temperature interpolating solution exists , and laying out a scheme to verify the conjectured diagram in more detail .",
    "the main idea is simply to expand perturbatively in powers of @xmath1 around the high temperature solution in minkowski space ( for simplicity , we focus on the case @xmath202 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the phase persists for @xmath203 , though numerical work appears to be needed to probe the regime @xmath204 , and thus to fully connect the baados black hole with the deconfined phase on flat space .",
    "given the high symmetry of the desired solutions , one may hope that such numerical investigations will be completed in the near future .",
    "we begin with an ansatz that should be general enough to include the desired solution which interpolates between the minkowski space deconfined solution and the de sitter deconfined phase , .    for simplicity ,",

    "to understand how these should be fixed , it is helpful to consider an alternate approach , working to all orders in @xmath1 , but perturbatively in @xmath266 , again demanding the @xmath208 behavior and the large @xmath155 behavior above . in this case , we obtain up to order @xmath267 @xmath268 we see that the most general solution may be expressed in terms of a single arbitrary function @xmath269 .",
    "the function @xmath269 should be fixed by demanding that the euclidean solution has no conical singularity along the curve @xmath270 .",
    "this is a whole function worth of conditions ( for each r , there will be some @xmath271 where @xmath272 , and we could have a potential conical singularity . demanding the absence of such a singularity typically requires the freedom of a whole function and should thus fix the solution of interest uniquely . in particular , this condition will determine which linear combination of the solution basis above corresponds to the physical solution of interest .",
    "the main focus of the current work has been to understand the behaviour of strongly coupled field theories in the static patch of de sitter spacetime for @xmath273 . in particular , we investigated the dynamics of cfts and confining gauge theories using the gauge / gravity duality",
    ".    for conformal field theories on global de sitter one has a unique vacuum state obtained from the euclidean bunch - davies vacuum .",
    "this vacuum is thermal in nature owing to the fact that a static observer in de sitter experiences thermal radiation emanating from his cosmological horizon . however , as we have argued it is possible to consider these theories in the static patch of de sitter at temperatures different from @xmath114 , at the expense of introducing a source on or just behind the cosmological horizon .",
    "we have constructed gravity duals for such theories and shown explicitly that the corresponding solutions in the bulk spacetime are manifestly regular . in particular ,",
    "an interesting feature of these solutions is the fact that the bulk horizon only knows about the temperature the field theory is at , rather than the de sitter temperature .",
    "this is despite the fact that the bulk horizon remains continuously connected to the de sitter horizon on the boundary , see .",
    "in addition to the behaviour of cfts on de sitter spacetime , we have also investigated the phase structure of confining gauge theories on these geometries .",
    "the class of confining theories we have investigated corresponds to those obtained via scherk - schwarz compactification of a higher dimensional cft .",
    "the confinement scale in these theories is set at the kaluza - klein scale of the scherk - schwarz circle . as described in @xcite , for such theories a suitable analytic continuation of the hawking - page phase transition , known to occur for thermal cfts on the einstein static universe ,",
    "can be used to demonstrate the existence of a phase transition .",
    "this phase transition occurs for the confining gauge theory as the acceleration parameter is varied past a critical value .",
    "we provided some modest evidence that this phase transition can be smoothly connected to the confinement / deconfinement transition in flat space by decoupling the temperature @xmath13 from the hubble constant @xmath1 .",
    "in realistic cosmological spacetimes , the hubble parameter changes dynamically , so we expect such phase transitions to occur dynamically in that context . in principle",
    ", this process could be studied using ads / cft by generalizing the de sitter boundary metric we have considered here to an frw - type metric with varying hubble parameter .",
    "the reduced symmetry in that situation would presumably necessitate a numerical study .",
    "alternatively , one could study the dynamics of transitions by working at fixed @xmath1 but starting in the phase corresponding to larger euclidean action . in this case",
    ", we should expect tunneling from the false vacuum to the true vacuum .",
    "precisely such a process was studied in detail in @xcite , in the context of decay of @xmath274 space via a bubble of nothing .",
    "reinterpreted in terms of the dual confining gauge theory , the process studied in @xcite represents a dynamical transition to a confined phase which occurs uniformly in space .",
    "more generally , one might expect the transition to proceed less uniformly ( e.g. by formation and percolation of bubbles ) , so it is possible that the gravitational instability considered in @xcite could be dominated by some less - symmetric process .",

    "in this appendix we give some basic details regarding the construction of the three dimensional geometries solving the equations of motion derived from whose boundary is with a temperature @xmath13 generically different from @xmath6 .",
    "since the boundary metric is static , we expect that the corresponding bulk solutions should also be static .",
    "this motivates an ansatz of the form .",
    "one can in fact easily show that for such an ansatz , all solutions are required to be of the form : @xmath276 where the functions @xmath277 depend solely on @xmath215 and are subject to additional coupled ordinary differential equations @xmath278 the solutions corresponding to the cft on with temperature equal to the de sitter temperature has @xmath279 while the solution corresponding to @xmath208 at temperature @xmath13 has @xmath280 we would like to find an interpolating solution corresponding to nonzero @xmath1 with @xmath13 not necessarily equal to @xmath6 . in order",
    "that the boundary metric is de sitter , we must have @xmath281 the temperature is encoded in the periodicity of the euclidean time , which is taken to be @xmath282 .    with this choice , we find that the most general solution to the differential equations for @xmath283 and @xmath284 is in fact given by @xmath285 where @xmath31 is an arbitrary constant of integration .",
    "this result matches both solutions above in the appropriate limits @xmath208 and @xmath286 provided we make the choice @xmath287 with this choice we arrive at the final interpolating solution as reported in .",
    "consider the lorentzian spacetime which is the dual of the confining gauge theory on de sitter for @xmath288 .",
    "first of all it is easy to see that the spacetime is regular in the vicinity of @xmath185 .",
    "in fact , as @xmath289 one encounters the origin of global ( in the euclidean solution ) . for the lorentzian solution a change of coordinates @xmath290 brings , to the manifestly regular form : @xmath291 in fact , the metric we have written covers a patch of the `` topological black hole '' solution described by baados @xcite . to understand this solution",
    ", we note that the global spacetime has a boost symmetry generated by a vector @xmath292 ( which is one of the generators of @xmath293 ) that one can use to quotient the geometry .",
    "this orbifold construction is similar in spirit to the construction of the btz black hole in three dimensions .",
    "in fact , one can write the metric , in manifestly btz form by the following coordinate transformation : @xmath294 which leads to the metric @xmath295 the only difference from the conventional btz metric in 3 dimensions is the fact that the temporal direction has been replaced by a copy of .    to understand the causal structure , it is useful to pass over to kruskal type coordinates described in @xcite . continuing with the btz analogy it is possible to find a coordinate chart that cover the fully - extended spacetime ( essentially by invoking the embedding coordinates for and finding an appropriate representative for the boost generator employed in the quotient ) . in such a suitable set of coordinates the metric for takes the form : @xmath296 where @xmath297",
    "the boost generator in question is then simply @xmath298 and quotient construction just involves identifying the coordinate @xmath299 to have period @xmath300 . in these coordinates ,",
    "the boundary of the spacetime is at @xmath301 , the horizon is the light cone @xmath302 , and we have a `` singularity '' at @xmath303 where the @xmath299 circle pinches off .",
    "the penrose diagram is shown in ( b )",
    ". an interesting feature of this geometry is the absence of a bifurcation surface on the horizon . since the horizon located at @xmath304 ( equivalently @xmath305 )",
    "is simply a copy of we see that one has instead a bifurcation point .",
