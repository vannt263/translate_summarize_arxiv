    "<S> two mechanisms of decoherence in ion traps are studied , specially related to the experiment [ kielpinski _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , science 291 ( 2001 ) 1013 ] </S>",
    "<S> . statistical hypothesis are made about unknown variables and the expected behaviour of the visibility of the best experimental pattern is calculated for each mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> data from the experiment are analyzed and show to be insufficient to distinguish between them . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest improvements which can do this with slight modifications in the present facilities .    </S>",
    "<S> decoherence , ions traps , decoherence free subspaces , 03.65.yz , 03.67.pp , 32.80.qk , 42.50.xa    ions traps are physical systems over which experimentalists have a large amount of precise control of the relevant degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> this naturally makes these systems good candidates for exploring quantum phenomena and even for small scale quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> decoherence is the major barrier to be overtaken . </S>",
    "<S> one way of understanding decoherence is as a kind of _ quantum noise_@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its consequence is the transformation of pure states , which can be described by a state vector @xmath0 , into mixed states to which only density operator description applies . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , there is a huge set of decoherence sources , from spurious electromagnetic fields originated in the lab , passing through small oscillations in parameter controls , up to background radiation and gravitational waves or whatever other kind of perturbation which forbids the system to be completely isolated@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> usually they are all considered as an _ environment _ to which the system is coupled .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we give special attention to a paper by the nist group@xcite , in which they showed how to produce a decoherence `` free '' qubit from a pair of ions trapped together . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of decoherence free subspaces can be classically understood , despite the fact of being a quantum phenomenon : if two classical moving particles are subjected to exactly the same noise , their relative motion is unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , if one can determine the major source of decoherence , and find two state vectors which are affected in the same way by free hamiltonian and this decoherence source , any quantum information encoded in the subspace generated by these two vectors will be preserved from this decoherence source . as a cat and rat dispute </S>",
    "<S> , the other sources of decoherence will prevent this subspace to be completely decoherence free , but decoherence times will be substantially raised . </S>",
    "<S> that is what was obtained in two different situations in the cited experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> we will start our analysis by considering that the major source of decoherence are oscillations in the magnetic fields used to split hyperfine structure of @xmath1 ions . </S>",
    "<S> more generally speaking , in situations like this , one can just consider the system to be subjected to a hamiltonian @xmath2 , which depends on a stochastic parameter @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> stochastic hamiltonians generate stochastic evolutions , so pure states evolve to mixed ensembles in a quantum state diffusion picture@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider a situation in which only the magnitude of the field is subjected to oscillations , then the eigenvectors of @xmath2 do not depend on @xmath3 , but their eigenvalues do . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a model like this for the ions : we are interested only in two internal states of each ion , so we consider the stochastic hamiltonian to be ( @xmath4 ) @xmath5 which can be rewritten as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the form ( [ hamxim ] ) makes evident the structure of the hamiltonians @xmath2 , including their dependence on @xmath3 . in the ideal case , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 , we get a doubly degenerate level with energy @xmath10 , and two other levels with energies @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> if the perturbations keep @xmath9 we have a bidimensional decoherence free subspace generated by @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> so the situation close to dfs is to have @xmath13 , and to consider initial states in this subspace . in this subspace , </S>",
    "<S> the term proportional to @xmath14 is ineffective , and decoherence is only originated by the variations in @xmath15 ( _ i.e. _ : only relative variations are important , because they affect born frequencies ) .    </S>",
    "<S> now we address the question : how does a state in a decoherence `` free '' subspace decohere ? </S>",
    "<S> let us consider an initially pure state @xmath16 for a fixed value @xmath3 , the hamiltonian ( [ hamxim ] ) implies that at time @xmath17 one has @xmath18 it is interesting to stress that in this model the vector state ( [ xistatet ] ) always belongs to the decoherence `` free '' subspace , but due to its dependence on @xmath3 , decoherence emerges . writing the state ( [ xistatet ] ) as a density operator and taking the ensemble average over the stochastic parameter @xmath3 , with weights @xmath19 , </S>",
    "<S> one gets @xmath20 } , \\label{rhok}\\ ] ] where we defined the parameter @xmath21    let us stop for a moment to discuss states like ( [ rhok ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a bloch vector picture is simple , specially in cylindrical coordinates : @xmath22 determines @xmath23 coordinate , and @xmath24 is the cylindrical radius ( _ i.e. _ : the distance to the @xmath23 axis ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting case is @xmath25 ( which corresponds to the experimental case ) , when @xmath26 directly gives the norm of bloch vector , which can be interpreted as a direct measure of the purity of the state . in practice </S>",
    "<S> , the norm of a bloch vector can be associated to the visibility of the best interferometer prepared with the state @xmath27 . in interferometric experiments </S>",
    "<S> one naturally searches for the largest visibility@xcite , therefore we shall focus our attention on the factor @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us discuss the factor @xmath28 of the model here presented , eq.([defk ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the only influence of @xmath3 we are considering is on the frequency @xmath29 , we can consider as stochastic parameter a frequency @xmath30 itself , with an ensemble weight @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> so we have @xmath32 where one can recognize the structure of fourier transform of the stochastic weight @xmath31 , so common in optics@xcite . as @xmath28 determines the visibility of the best interferometer prepared with state @xmath27 , the data of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite must fit this expression for @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting improvement on the experiment would be to independently monitor the magnetic field , and try to compare the fringe visibility and the fourier transform of the statistical variations of the field . </S>",
    "<S> this would decide whether fluctuations of the magnetic field are the major decoherence source or not . </S>",
    "<S> as these fluctuations are not available , we can only speculate about them . </S>",
    "<S> one natural hypothesis is of gaussian distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this would imply a gaussian decay of @xmath26 with time @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> other distributions can also appear , but we have no a priori reasons for treating them . </S>",
    "<S> one last example is to suppose exponential decay for the visibility , what in this model would be consistent with lorentzian stochastic weight @xmath33    in the cited experiment@xcite , one state in the decoherence `` free '' subspace ( dfs state ) and one out of it ( test state ) were submitted to two distinct situations each : autonomous evolution , just subjected to natural noise , and an engineered reservoir , consisting of a dissonant laser with random intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the first situation is supposed to be well modeled by the above discussion on variable magnetic field , but the second one deserves special attention . </S>",
    "<S> experimental values allow one to consider only decoherence sources related to the presence of the dissonant laser . the most simple way to do </S>",
    "<S> it would be to consider the dispersive approximation to jaynes - cummings model for the interaction among one field mode and two two - level ions : @xmath34 where @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is a dipolar coupling constant , @xmath40 is the detuning , and dispersive approximation was applied , under the condition @xmath41 , @xmath42 the number of photons . </S>",
    "<S> however , this can not mimic the experimental situation , unless we include somehow the randomization of the laser field . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done by considering an environment coupled to this field . as usual , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a huge set of harmonic oscillators and bilinear coupling as a model to the environment . </S>",
    "<S> in this sense , the full hamiltonian we must consider is @xmath43 the laser - environment part of this hamiltonian can be rewritten in terms of normal modes , and this formally shows the equivalence between two ions coupled to a laser coupled to an environment and the same two ions directly coupled to a reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> to go further one needs to make some hypothesis on the coupling of the laser to the environment . </S>",
    "<S> white noise is a natural choice , and a wigner - weisskopf like approximation@xcite implies the form of the coupling between ions and environmental normal modes . </S>",
    "<S> this is once again consistent with exponential decay of fringe contrast in interferometry .    </S>",
    "<S> so , we considered two distinct sources of decoherence for a system like the one worked out in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : one given by stochastic variations of the energy levels ( probably due to variations of the applied magnetic field ) , and other given by the direct coupling to a `` classical '' field mode ( `` classical '' in the sense of being strongly coupled to an environment ) . for both , </S>",
    "<S> we made statistically natural hypothesis , namely gaussian fluctuations and white noise . </S>",
    "<S> the first model naturally gives gaussian decay for the fringe contrast while the second implies exponential decay . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore strongly believe that when the laser is off , `` natural '' decoherence will fit a gaussian , while with the laser on , `` engineered '' decoherence will be exponential . </S>",
    "<S> we take the data from the experiment , and used least square methods to obtain the best gaussian and the best exponential to each set of data , and also used a kind of sieve to try to tell us if the points fit better a gaussian or an exponential . </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss in detail the methods we used and the results we got .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the function which we statistically treated was @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the visibility of the fringe pattern . </S>",
    "<S> for each set of data we search for the least square curves of the form @xmath46 for which is important to say that both have the same number of parameters , what make the comparison fair . </S>",
    "<S> for each set of data , and each fitting family , we accumulate the vertical distances between the measured points and the best fitting curve and compare : for each set of data , the one which accumulate less distance is considered the best curve . for each initial state and laser situation </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows the experimental points , the best gaussian ( in fact , the best parabola for the logarithm ) and the best exponential ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> linear function ) . </S>",
    "<S> the accumulated distance is given in captions . </S>",
    "<S> the worked data are not enough to corroborate or deny our pre - conclusions about the form the coherence decays in each case , although a few more points could do the job . also , as pointed out before , independently recording the field fluctuations and comparing its line shape to the visibility ( with the laser off ) could test the usually accepted viewpoint that the most important decoherence source are these field fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this work can stimulate more detailed experiments towards a better understanding of the mechanisms of decoherence on ion traps . </S>"
