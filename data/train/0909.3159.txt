    "a fossil group consists of an isolated , luminous early - type galaxy embedded in an extended x - ray halo .",
    "the origin of such systems is still a matter of debate , with three main scenarios proposed in the literature .",
    "first , fgs may be the end - product of merging galaxies in normal loose groups at high redshift ( ponman et al .",
    "1994 ; jones et al . 2000 ; khosroshahi , jones & ponman 2004 ) .",
    "the main motivation for this idea is that the merger time scales for @xmath3 group galaxies are much shorter than the cooling time scales for the hot gas component in which they are embedded ( e.g. barnes 1989 , ponman & bertram 1993 ) . in this simplistic view",
    ", fgs can be used to trace the mechanisms driving the coalescence of galaxies in the not - so - high - redshift universe .",
    "alternatively , fgs may originate in regions that inhibit the formation of @xmath4 galaxies , leading to an atypical galaxy luminosity function ( mulchaey & zabludoff 1999 ) .",
    "an intermediate picture is also plausible , whereby the atypical luminosity function of fgs is a transient yet common phase in the evolution of groups , ending with the infall of fresh galaxies from the surroundings  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we compare the properties of bright ellipticals in fossil and non - fossil systems , homogeneously selected from the same dataset , together with those of galaxies in hickson compact groups ( hcgs ) .",
    "the fg sample is described in sec .  1 , while sec .  2",
    "compares the properties of the fossil , non - fossil , and hcg samples .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "we select fgs using spectroscopy and photometry from sdss - dr4 , and rass x - ray imaging .",
    "we define a volume - limited sample consisting of all galaxies in sdss with r - band petrosian magnitude @xmath5 and spectroscopic redshift in the range of @xmath6 to @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "a galaxy is defined as an fg optical candidate if it has early - type morphology and no companion galaxies within a magnitude gap of  @xmath8  mag inside a cylinder ( parallel to the line - of - sight ) with a radius of  @xmath9  mpc and a semi - height of  @xmath10  km / s ( see  @xcite , hereafter ldc09 , for details ) .",
    "we further exclude galaxies hosting an agn , classified using the diagnostic diagrams of  @xcite , as well as fg candidates closer than @xmath11  mpc to a rich ( @xmath12 ) abell cluster .    ,",
    "width=491 ]    for each optical candidate , we measure the x - ray luminosity @xmath13 ( @xmath14  kev ) from the rass .",
    "a source is considered to have an x - ray counterpart if there is an x - ray detection whose position is matched to that of the optical source within @xmath15  fwhm and whose luminosity is 3  @xmath16 above background .",
    "we classify the fg x - ray sources as extended if the extension parameter is greater than zero at the 2@xmath16 level .",
    "the extension parameter is measured by subtracting in quadrature the fwhm of the rass psf from the fwhm of the fgs .",
    "our final sample consists of 25 fgs .",
    "[ f1 ] shows three fg examples of x - ray contours from the rass , with the positions of the optical sources overlaid .",
    "we select a control sample ( hereafter cs ) of bright ellipticals from sdss+rass following the same procedure as for the fgs , but without applying the cylinder test for bright companions around the first - ranked galaxy .",
    "this yields a sample of @xmath17 cs ellipticals ( against @xmath18 fgs ) .",
    "[ f2 ] compares the distributions of @xmath13 and @xmath1 ( describing the deviation of the galaxy isophotes from purely elliptical shapes ) for the fg and cs systems .",
    "the @xmath13 distributions are fully consistent ( using the ks test ) .",
    "since fgs and cs ellipticals have similar optical luminosities ( by construction ) , the consistency of @xmath13 implies that fossils do not have enhanced x - ray luminosity compared to non - fossil galaxies , in contrast to the results of  @xcite and  @xcite , but in agreement with  @xcite .",
    "the distributions of @xmath1 values are also consistent , with fg and cs galaxies presenting both disky ( @xmath19 ) and boxy ( @xmath20 ) isophotes .",
    "this result is in disagreement with that of  @xcite , who concluded that fg systems have preferentially boxy isophotes ( for a sample of seven fgs ) . on the other hand",
    ", the fact that fg ellipticals can have a variety of isophotal shapes agrees with the predictions of n - body simulations from  @xcite .",
    "( left panel ) and @xmath1 ( right panel ) for fgs ( filled circles ) and control sample ellipticals ( empty symbols ; normalized to the total number of fgs ) .",
    "error bars are 1  @xmath16 poissonian errors ( from ldc09 ) .",
    "[ f2],width=377 ]    we also investigate the stellar population properties of the fg and cs samples - age , metallicity , and @xmath2-enhancement , @xmath21 $ ] ( see ldc09 for details ) .",
    "the twenty elliptical galaxies in hickson compact groups ( hcgs ) , studied by de la rosa et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , are also included in the analysis .",
    "[ f3 ] shows @xmath21 $ ] as a function of the central velocity dispersion , @xmath22 , for galaxies in the three samples .",
    "we find that the stellar population properties of fg galaxies are very similar to those of bright ellipticals in non - fossil systems while ellipticals in hcgs have lower @xmath21 $ ] relative to both fg and cs galaxies .",
    "is plotted as a function of the central velocity dispersion , @xmath22 , for first - ranked galaxies in fgs ( filled circles ) ; ellipticals in the control sample ( empty circles ) ; and ellipticals in hcgs ( filled triangles ) .",
    "the dashed line is the best - fit line for field galaxies ( see ldc09 ) .",
    "[ f3],width=340 ]",
    "we find a striking consistency between fossil and non - fossil galaxies .",
    "this similarity indicates that fgs are not a separate class of systems , but represent a common phase in the evolutionary history of galaxy groups , which can undergo fossil phases at different cosmic epochs , with these phases ending with an infall of gas rich galaxies from their surroundings  @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that generally there is no evolutionary link between fossil and compact group ( cg ) galaxies .",
    "in fact , dry mergers of ellipticals in cgs would not increase their @xmath2-enhancement , and can not therefore generate the higher @xmath23 observed in most of the fg galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) . on the other hand , wet",
    "mergers also seem not to play a major role , since we do not find any excess of first - ranked ellipticals with either disky isophotes or positive internal color gradients ( see ldc09 ) .",
    "however , if ellipticals in cgs at intermediate redshifts have different properties from those in cgs at @xmath24  @xcite , our results can not rule out an evolutionary sequence between the higher-@xmath25 cgs and low-@xmath25 fgs .",
