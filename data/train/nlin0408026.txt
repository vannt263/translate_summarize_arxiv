    "many chemical and biological systems exhibit excitability . in small ( zero - dimensional ) geometry",
    "they show threshold behavior , i.e. small perturbations immediately decay , whereas sufficiently large perturbations decay only after a large excursion .",
    "one dimensional ( 1d ) excitable media support travelling pulses , or rather , periodic wave trains ranging in wavelength @xmath0 from the localized limit @xmath1 to a minimal value @xmath2 .",
    "pulses and wavetrains are best - known from nerve propagation along axons . in 2d one typically observes spiral waves .",
    "spirals have been observed for example in the auto - catalytic belousov - zhabotinsky reaction @xcite , in the aggregation of the slime mold dictyostelium discoideum @xcite and in cardiac tissue @xcite .    for certain system parameters",
    "the propagation of pulses , wave trains or the development of spiral waves may fail ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the analytical tools employed to describe these phenomena range from kinematic theory @xcite , asymptotic perturbation theory @xcite to dynamical systems approaches @xcite .",
    "however , no theory exists which describes propagation failure using only equation parameters , and which reproduces the behavior close to the bifurcation point .",
    "for example , asymptotic perturbation theory fails to describe the square - root scaling behavior of the amplitude and the pulse velocity with respect to the bifurcation parameter at the bifurcation point . in kinematic theory results",
    "are not given entirely in terms of the system parameters .",
    "in this paper we develop a non - perturbative method to study propagation failure and compare the results with numerical simulations .",
    "+ most theoretical investigations are based on coupled reaction - diffusion models .",
    "we follow this tradition and investigate a two - component , two - dimensional excitable medium with an activator @xmath3 and a non - diffusive inhibitor @xmath4 described by @xmath5 this is a reparametrized version of a model introduced by barkley @xcite .",
    "we expect our method to be independent of the particular model used .",
    "note that the diffusion constant @xmath6 is not a relevant parameter as it can be scaled out by rescaling the length .",
    "this model incorporates the ingredients of an excitable system in a compact and lucid way .",
    "thus , for @xmath7 the rest state @xmath8 is linearly stable with decay rates @xmath9 along the activator direction and @xmath10 along the inhibitor direction .",
    "perturbing @xmath3 above the threshold @xmath11 ( in 0d ) will lead to growth of @xmath3 . in the absence of @xmath4",
    "the activator would saturate at @xmath12 leading to a bistable system . a positive inhibitor growth factor @xmath13 and @xmath14 forces the activator to decay back to @xmath15 .",
    "finally also the inhibitor with the refractory time constant @xmath16 will decay back to @xmath17 .",
    "for @xmath18 the system is in zero - dimensional systems no longer excitable but instead bistable .",
    "this relaxation behaviour in the 0d system for super - threshold perturbations gives rise to pulse solutions in the 1d ( and 2d ) case .",
    "the relaxation mechanism mediated by the inhibitor forces the pulse solution to decay in its back .",
    "hence we observe pulses in excitable media and not fronts .",
    "the barkley model is a variant of the class of 2-component fitzhugh - nagumo models . in the traditional fitzhugh - nagumo models",
    "@xmath19 in eq.([barkley ] ) is replaced by @xmath20 .",
    "thus the nullclines @xmath21 , which in the traditional fitzhugh - nagumo models are cubic polynomials , are replaced by straight lines in the barkley model .",
    "most of the qualitative behavior in the relevant parameter ranges is unchanged by this . whereas the barkley model is computationally more efficient and also analytically better tractable , the traditional fitzhugh - nagumo models display a feature which makes them more realistic for the discription of excitable media in biology : the activator experiences an undershoot below its equilibrium value and slow decay in the tail region of a pulse .",
    "we expect that for the phenomena discussed in this paper the difference only leads to quantitative changes ( indeed , we have done some tests to verify this assertion ) .    in order to study pulse propagation in 1d",
    "it is useful to first consider the case of constant @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting bistable model is exactly solvable @xcite and the pulse velocity is @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "hence , excitability requires that @xmath11 is below the stall value @xmath23 .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 characterizes the strength of excitability and @xmath25 coincides with the solitary pulse velocity for @xmath26 .",
    "clearly , for @xmath27 and not too large @xmath28 , pulse propagation fails for @xmath13 larger than some @xmath29 .",
    "the critical growth factor @xmath29 describes the onset of a saddle - node bifurcation @xcite .",
    "the saddle node can be intuitively understood when we consider the activator pulse as a heat source , not unlike a fire - front in a bushfire . due to the inhibitor",
    "the width of the pulse decreases with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "hence , the heat contained within the pulse decreases . at a critical width , or a critical @xmath13 , the heat contained within",
    "the pulse is too small to ignite / excite the medium in front of the pulse .    for periodic wavetrains",
    "the saddle node depends on the wavelength .",
    "the pulses run into the inhibitor field of their respective preceding pulse .",
    "hence , propagation failure for periodic wave trains is controlled by the decay of the inhibitor and propagation is only possible when the inter - pulse distance @xmath0 becomes larger than a critical wavelength @xmath2 .",
    "note that @xmath2 diverges for @xmath30 when the decay rate of the inhibitor @xmath31 vanishes .",
    "+ in previous analytic works on one - dimensional pulses the limit of small @xmath13 was considered @xcite .",
    "then the solution of the activator @xmath3 is well separated in two flat plateau regions with @xmath32 and @xmath15 which are separated by a steep narrow front .",
    "this approach does not capture the square - root behavior of @xmath33 close to the saddle - node bifurcation point .",
    "close to the bifurcation point the solution resembles rather a bell - shaped pulse than a plateau . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with the behavior near the bifurcation at @xmath29 and make explicit use of the observed bell - shape form of the solution .",
    "this allows us to describe the scaling behavior close to the bifurcation in terms of the equation parameters .    in 2 dimensions spiral waves",
    "are observed .",
    "spirals can be created in excitable media from a finger , i.e. a 1d pulse which is extended in the second dimension and has one free end .",
    "fingers may be created due to inhomogeneities in the excitability of the system @xcite . at long times ,",
    "the free end will either sprout or retract depending on the growing velocity @xmath34 being positive or negative . if @xmath35 , the tip of the finger will sprout into the fresh medium , and in particular it sprouts and curves backwards .",
    "this causes a non - vanishing curvature at the tip of the finger . due to the increased curvature",
    "the finger tip is slower than the flat part of the front further away from the tip .",
    "thus , the extending part far from the tip will curl up .",
    "this leads to the formation of a spiral with the free end at its core .",
    "the criterion @xmath35 is therefore a necessary criterion for spiral formation .",
    "the transition to retraction always occurs before the 1d propagation failure .",
    "it is harder to tackle analytically .",
    "general and universal dynamical system approaches exploiting only the euclidean symmetry of excitable media describe the transition as a drift bifurcation .",
    "these model independent theories give an explanation for the divergence of the core radius at the bifurcation point and also explain why a finger at the bifurcation point is translating with finite speed , i.e. that the transition to retracting fingers always occurs before the 1d propagation failure @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it has the unphysical result that at the bifurcation point @xmath36 a spiral changes its sense of rotation @xcite . whereas these theories treat the spiral as a global solution of the underlying equations and see the transition to spiral waves as a pitchfork or drift bifurcation @xcite",
    ", we take a local approach and describe the transition not as a bifurcation but as a quantitative change in the velocity of the finger , analogous to a maxwell point in a first - oder phase transition .",
    "asymptotic techniques in the limit @xmath37 have also been performed for this problem @xcite and produced an analytical expression for the onset of retraction for small @xmath13 . moreover ,",
    "the authors were able to go one step further , in a detailed and sophisticated asymptotic analysis , and described the onset of meandering . in this paper",
    "we go beyond the restriction of small @xmath13 and propose a more intuitive approach to the problem of the growing velocity which nevertheless gives good agreement with the numerics .",
    "+ in the following we assume given excitability parameters @xmath28 , @xmath11 and take @xmath13 as the bifurcation parameter .",
    "we will be looking for solutions that move with velocity @xmath38 in the @xmath39 direction and may grow ( or retract ) with velocity @xmath34 in the @xmath40 direction .",
    "thus we rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ barkley ] ) in a frame moving with velocity @xmath41 as @xmath42",
    "we first look for pulse and wavetrain solutions that do not depend on @xmath40 .",
    "the reason for the failure to describe the pulse properties at @xmath29 within the framework of asymptotics employing the smallness of @xmath13 is due to the fact that at @xmath29 the pulse shape for @xmath3 can not be separated into a steep narrow front and a flat plateau .",
    "hence , asymptotic techniques such as inner and outer expansions are bound to fail .",
    "instead the pulse has the shape of a rather symmetric bell - shaped function ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in the following",
    "we make explicit use of the shape of the pulse close to the critical point and parametrize the pulse appropriately ; a method reminiscent of the method of collective coordinates in the studies of solitary waves @xcite .",
    "we choose @xmath3 of the general form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is chosen as a symmetric , bell - shaped function , for example a gaussian , of unit width and height .",
    "hence , we restrict the solutions to a subspace of bell - shaped functions @xmath44 which is parametrized by the amplitude @xmath45 and the inverse pulse width @xmath46 .",
    "the aim of our method is to determine the so far undetermined parameters .",
    "this is done by minimizing the error made by the restriction to the subspace defined by ( [ ansatz ] ) .",
    "we avoid further uncontrolled approximations and solve for the inhibitor field @xmath4 explicitly @xmath47 where @xmath48 @xmath49 is determined via the periodic boundary condition @xmath50 and is @xmath51 we assume that the width @xmath52 is small compared to the distance between two consecutive pulses @xmath0 . in the temporal domain",
    "this means that the time scale for the decay of the inhibitor is much longer than the activator pulse width .",
    "this assures that the activator field of consecutive pulses is well separated and only the inhibitor field overlaps , and that the interaction between pulses is mediated only through the inhibitor .",
    "otherwise we would have to choose periodic functions @xmath44 .",
    "however , in this case we can now replace the limits of integration @xmath53 by @xmath54 . for the isolated pulse ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath55 , @xmath49 vanishes .",
    "we now determine the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 by projecting eq .",
    "( [ barkleyt1 ] ) onto the tangent space of the restricted subspace defined by ( [ ansatz ] ) .",
    "the tangent space is spanned by @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this assures that the error made by restricting the solution space to the test functions is minimized . to achieve this , we multiply eq .",

    "the resulting equations can be combined to give , at fixed @xmath62 and @xmath28 , a quadratic equation for @xmath45 with two solutions @xmath63 which describe the stable and unstable branch , respectively ( see below for a subtle issue at the saddle node ) .",
