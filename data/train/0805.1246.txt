    "it remains unknown to what degree present - day galaxies are assembled discretely via the merger of pre - existing galaxies ( e.g. kauffmann , white , & guideroni 1993 ; somerville , primack , & faber 2001 ) or through more continuous processes such as cold gas and dark matter accretion ( e.g. kere et al . 2005 ; dekel & birnboim 2006 ) . the most obvious way to constrain the importance of galaxy mergers is to count the number of on - going merger events . however , current observational constraints on the galaxy merger rate are highly uncertain and strongly debated ( ryan et al . 2008 ; lin et al . 2008 ; lotz et al . 2008 ; renzini 2007 ; kartaltepe et al . 2007 ; masjedi et al .",
    ". moreover , theoretical predictions for the galaxy merger rate and mass assembly can vary by factors of ten ( jogee et al . 2008 ) .",
    "these discrepancies are partially the result of the non - trivial conversion of the observed number density of galaxy mergers into a galaxy merger rate and the comparison of this galaxy merger rate to the cosmological predictions for dark matter halo assembly ( e.g. berrier et al . 2007 ; guo & white 2008 ; kitzbichler & white 2008 ) .    since the realization that the merger of two disc galaxies could produce a spheroidal galaxy (",
    "toomre 1977 ) , spheroidal galaxies , red galaxies , and post - starburst galaxies have been used to indirectly trace the role of galaxy mergers in galaxy evolution ( e.g. bell et al . 2004 ; faber et al . 2007 ; brown et al . 2007 ; abraham et al . 2007 ;",
    "hopkins et al . 2007 ; hogg et al . 2006 ) . however , there are multiple ways to quench star - formation and produce post - starbursts or red spheroidal galaxies ( e.g. dekel & birnboim 2006 ; moore , lake , & katz et al .",
    "also , simulations of galaxy mergers often show significant star - formation and disc components well after the merger event ( springel & hernquist 2005 ; robertson et al .",
    "2006a ; naab , jesseit , & burkert 2006 ; cox et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ; khalatyan et al 2008 ) , thus the photometric and morphological signatures of merger remnants are ambiguous . a merger remnant s star - formation history , morphology , and kinematics are likely to depend on the properties of the progenitors and the merger conditions , which are increasingly difficult to determine as time passes",
    ". therefore _ direct _ observations of on - going galaxy mergers are needed to constrain the role of mergers in galaxy assembly .",
    "galaxy merging is a process that lasts several billion years rather than a short - lived event .",
    "the signatures of a galaxy merger change with merger stage , making the identification of galaxy mergers challenging .",
    "if hierarchical models of galaxy assembly are correct , then the majority of massive galaxies could be considered an on - going merger or a merger remnant which will undergo another merger event within a few gyr ( stewart et al .",
    "we shall define a galaxy merger as a pair of galaxies which are gravitationally bound and whose orbits will dynamically decay such that their nuclei will merge within @xmath6 billion years , where @xmath6 is typically 1 - 3 gyr for ` major ' mergers with mass ratios greater than 1:3 .",
    "there are two general approaches to identifying such systems observationally .",
    "the first approach is to find close pairs of galaxies before their nuclei have coalesced , either by selecting galaxies close in projected angular separation and line - of - sight radial velocity ( e.g. patton et al .",
    "2000 ; barton , geller , & kenyon 2000 ; lin et al . 2004",
    "; de propris et al .",
    "2005 ; lin et al .",
    "2008 ) or by measuring the deprojected correlation function on small scales ( bell et al . 2006a ; masjedi et al . 2006 , 2008",
    "; li et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the second approach is to identify morphologically disturbed galaxies , some of which will be post - mergers and some of which will be interacting pairs .",
    "morphological disturbances can be found qualitatively through visual inspection ( e.g. kampczyk et al .",
    "2007 ; bundy et al . 2005 ; brinchmann et al . 1998 ) , or by quantitative measures such as the gini coefficient , second - order moment of the brightest 20% of the light ( @xmath1 ) , and asymmetry ( abraham et al .",
    "1994 ; conselice 2003 ; abraham et al . 2003",
    "; lotz , primack , & madau 2004 [ lpm04 ] ; scarlata et al .",
    "2007 ) . at present , all quantitative merger indicators are calibrated empirically using galaxies with ` normal ' and ` disturbed ' visual classifications .",
    "translating the number of observed merger candidates into a merger rate requires the assumption of an observability time - scale  the time during which one would have identified the system as merging . until now , this time - scale has been poorly constrained .",
    "close pair studies often assume a dynamical friction time - scale ( which varies from 200 myr to 1 gyr ) .",
    "however this value does not take into account the range of possible orbits for the merging system nor the time during which the system would not meet the pair criteria at very large and very small separations .",
    "also , recent comparison of n - body simulations to analytical calculations indicate that analytically - derived dynamical friction time - scales can deviate substantially from those predicted by n - body simulations ( boylan - kolchin , ma , & quataert 2008 ; jiang et al .",
    "very similar time - scales are also generally assumed for mergers selected using both visual and quantitative morphologies .",
    "this assumption is even less likely to be valid given that different morphological selection criteria are sensitive to different stages of the merger process .",
    "for example , visual classification using a combination of signatures ( e.g. tidal tails , multiple nuclei , shells ) is likely to be sensitive for longer time - scales and lower - mass merger ratios than current quantitative methods .    the observability time - scale for a particular merger may depend on ( 1 ) the method used to identify the merger ; ( 2 ) the merger parameters ( mass ratio , gas properties , bulge / disc ratio , orbits , dust content ) ; and ( 3 ) the observational selection ( observed wavelength , viewing angle , spatial resolution ) . cosmological - scale numerical simulations currently do not have the spatial resolution to directly determine the cosmologically - averaged observability time - scale for each method .",
    "therefore , one is required to use a suite of galaxy - scale numerical simulations which span a large range of input merger parameters to constrain the observability time - scales for the different input parameters . given a sufficiently broad range of merger parameters ,",
    "the observability time - scales for each parameter set may then be weighted by the probability distribution of the mass ratios , gas fraction , etc . which can be computed from current cosmological - scale simulations .",
    "an additional complication is that galaxy - scale numerical simulations typically track the distribution of ` particles ' ( star , gas , and dark matter ) , as opposed to the projected light distribution at a particular wavelength ( which is what is observed ) .",
    "a few works have attempted to quantify the observability time - scales using only the stellar particles ( conselice 2006 ; bell et al .",
    "2006b ) or gas particles ( iono , yun , & mihos 2004 ) and ignoring the effects of dust and age - dependent stellar luminosities . while this may be acceptable for gas - poor dissipationless mergers ( e.g. bell et al .",
    "2006b ) , the appearance of most gas - rich mergers is almost certainly affected strongly by both young stars and dust .    in this work ,",
    "we present a first attempt to constrain the observability time - scales for a variety of methods for identifying galaxy mergers .",
    "we present a morphological analysis of a large suite of gadget n - body / sph equal - mass gas - rich disc galaxy merger simulations which have been processed through the monte - carlo radiative transfer code sunrise . with the resulting images ,",
    "we examine the dependence of quantitative morphology in the sdss @xmath4-band ( @xmath7 4686 ) on merger stage , dust , viewing angle , orbital parameters , gas properties , supernova feedback , and total mass .",
    "we constrain the time - scales of quantitative morphology disturbances in gini coefficient , @xmath1 , and asymmetry , and the time - scales during which close pairs lie at projected separations @xmath820 , 30 , 50 , and 100 @xmath9 kpc , assuming @xmath10 .",
    "finally , we compare the simulated merger remnant morphologies and star - formation rates . in  2 , we describe the galaxy merger simulations , including the gadget n - body / sph calculations , the sunrise monte - carlo radiative transfer calculations , the initial galaxy models , and the range of merger parameters explored . in  3 , we define the morphological quantities @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ". we also describe the different observational criteria used to identify galaxy mergers , and define the merger observability time - scale for each method . in  4 , we present the results of our analysis , and in  5 we discuss the implications of these results for finding galaxy mergers , calculating the merger rate , and the properties of merger remnants .",
    "a subsequent paper with a similar analysis of non - equal mass mergers is in preparation .",
    "all of the simulations presented in this work were performed using the n - body / sph code gadget ( springel et al .",
    "the details of these simulations , their global star - formation histories , and their remnant properties are discussed in cox et .",

    "each galaxy is initially modeled as a disc of stars and gas , a stellar bulge , and a dark matter halo .",
    "the stellar and dark matter particles are collisionless and are subject to only gravitational forces .",
    "the gas particles are also subject to hydro - dynamical forces .",
    "the baryonic and dark matter particles have gravitational softening lengths of 100 pc and 400 pc respectively .",
    "the sph smoothing length for the gas particles indicates the size of the region over which the particle s hydrodynamic quantities are averaged and is required to be greater than half the gravitational softening length or @xmath11 50 pc . while we use the first version of gadget ( springel et al .",
    "2001 ) , the smoothed particle hydrodynamics are upgraded to use the ` conservative entropy ' version that is described in springel & hernquist ( 2002 ) .",
    "the radiative cooling rate @xmath12(@xmath13 , @xmath14 ) is computed for a primordial plasma as described in katz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "gas particles are transformed into collisionless star particles assuming the kennicutt - schmidt law ( kennicutt 1998 ) where the star - formation rate depends on the local gas density @xmath15 .",
    "this occurs in a stochastic sense ( springel & hernquist 2003 ) in which each gas particle can spawn one or two new star particles with a probability determined by the star - formation rate .",
    "these new star particles have typical masses @xmath16 m@xmath17 , and are assigned ages based on their formation time and metallicities based on the metallicity of the gas particle from which they are spawned .",
    "we adopt the instantaneous recycling approximation for metal production whereby massive stars are assumed to instantly become supernovae , and the metals produced are put back into the gas phase of the particle . in this version of gadget , metals do not mix and remain in the gas particle in which they are formed . the enriched gas contribution from stellar winds and type ia supernovae",
    "are ignored .",
    "unlike the metals , there is no recycling of hydrogen and helium to the gas .",
    "feedback from supernovae is required to produce stable star - forming discs .",
    "energy from supernovae heats and pressurizes the interstellar gas and stabilizes it against gravitational collapse .",
    "because of the limited resolution of most n - body / sph simulations , the physical processes associated with supernova feedback can not be directly modeled and must be included using simple prescriptions .",
    "we test two supernova feedback models , which are discussed in detail in cox et al .",
    "both models assume the supernova feedback energy is dissipated on an 8 myr time - scale , and have a equation of state parameterized by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 model treats star - forming gas with a stiff equation of state where the pressure in star - forming regions scales as @xmath21 , while the @xmath22 model assumes that this gas is isothermal with an effective temperature @xmath16 k ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "both feedback models produce stable isolated star - forming discs and predict similar gas consumption during the merger , but the strength and timing of the merger - induced starbursts depend on the feedback model assumed ( cox et al .",
    "no active galactic nuclei are included in these simulations .",
    "such agn are expected to influence the star - formation and morphologies only during the post - merger stages ( see  5 for discussion ) .",
    "sunrise is a parallel code which performs full monte carlo radiative - transfer calculations using an adaptive - mesh refinement grid ( jonsson 2006 ; jonsson et al .",
    "this code was developed to calculate the effects of dust on the emission from the gadget n - body / sph simulations .",
    "sunrise can model arbitrary geometries of emitting and absorbing / scattering material with a large spatial dynamical range and efficiently generate images of the emerging radiation viewed from arbitrary points in space .",
    "we use sunrise v2 for these simulations ( jonsson 2006 ) . given a particular simulation geometry and viewing angle , sunrise v2 performs the monte - carlo radiative transfer calculation for 20 wavelengths from the far - ultraviolet to the mid - infrared and interpolates a resulting spectral energy distribution of 510 wavelengths including the effects of absorption and scattering .",
    "at least 30 timesteps are analysed for each merger simulation . for each gadget simulation timestep , sunrise assigns a spectral energy distribution to each star particle using the starburst99 population synthesis models ( leitherer et al .",
    "new star particles are treated as single stellar populations with ages based on their formation time .",
    "bulge star particles form in an instantaneous burst well before the start of the simulation ( 8 - 13 gyr depending on the galaxy model ; see rocha et al .",
    "initial disc star particles are assumed to have formed with an exponentially declining star - formation starting at the time of the formation of the bulge .",
    "the metallicities of the gas and stars of the initial galaxy models decline exponentially with the radius of the disc .",
    "the density of dust is linearly proportional to the density of metals in the gas .",
    "the dust attenuation in the initial galaxy models have been found to reproduce the observed galaxy inclination - attenuation relations and the global infrared - to - ultraviolet flux ratios for spiral galaxies ( rocha et al .",
    "2008 ) . during the merger , the gas discs of the initial galaxies become disrupted , resulting in complicated dust geometries .",
    "the full radiative transfer calculation done by the sunrise v2 code are well - suited to determining the effects of complicated dust geometries . however , the dust approximation is limited by the low spatial resolution of the regions of cold gas and star - formation in the input gadget simulations ( @xmath24 100 pc )",
    ". therefore the attenuation of very young stars may be underestimated , and the effects of clumpy dust and gas on small scales are not included .",
    "a future version of sunrise will include improved treatment of small scales .",
    "the attenuation and infrared luminosities of the output sunrise images during the merger have been compared to the available literature for local dusty mergers .",
    "jonsson et al . ( 2006 ) found that these simulations reproduce the observed relationships between ultraviolet spectral slope @xmath25 and the global infrared - to - ultraviolet flux ratio , thus the simulated dust distribution is a reasonable approximation of the dust found in local dusty mergers .",
    "images in multiple band - passes ( galex fuv / nuv , sdss @xmath26 , 2mass @xmath27 ) for 11 isotropically positioned viewpoints ( ` cameras ' ) are generated and the total absorbed bolometric luminosity over all wavelengths / viewing angles is calculated .",
    "these cameras are positioned with respect to the plane of the merger orbit at @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( degrees ) = ( 0,0 ) , ( 0 , 79 ) , ( 72 , 79 ) , ( 144 , 79 ) , ( 216,79 ) , ( 288,79 ) , ( 0 , 127 ) , ( 72 , 127 ) , ( 144 , 127 ) , ( 216 , 127 ) , and ( 288,127 ) . in figures 1 and 2 ,",
    "we show examples of composite sdss @xmath30 images for one of our simulations viewed face - on ( camera 0 ) and edge - on ( camera 4 ) .",
    "the predicted dust attenuation for the initial undisturbed galaxy models agrees well with observations of dust attenuation in local disc galaxies ( rocha et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the goal of this work is to calibrate the morphological disturbance time - scales for merging and interacting galaxies using realistic ` observations ' of galaxy merger simulations including the effects of star formation and dust .",
    "dust and star formation have a much stronger effect on gas - rich merger morphologies than dissipationless mergers , hence we examine the mergers of gas - rich disc galaxies .",
    "all of the disc galaxy models explored here have relatively small bulge components with stellar bulge - to - disc mass ratios @xmath31 0.25 .",
    "such low bulge - to - disc ratio galaxies are more likely to experience strong starbursts ( mihos & hernquist 1996 , cox et al .",
    "2008 ) and stronger morphological disturbances ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "these galaxies may also be more representative of high redshift mergers , as bulge - dominated systems are increasingly rare at @xmath32 ( e.g. lotz et al .",

    "we adopt two general models for gas - rich discs : the ` sbc ' model tuned to match a large , gas - rich sbc disc galaxy , and the ` g - series ' of discs with varying mass ( g3 , g3 , g1 , g0 ) with lower gas fractions tuned to match sdss observations of local galaxies .",

    "however , the turnover in the angular - size/ redshift relation is such that the angular scale of galaxies does not change dramatically at @xmath36 . in order to determine if the time - scales calculated here can be applied to @xmath35 images of high - redshift galaxies , we measure the morphologies and time - scales of the high numerical resolution simulation sbcppx10 tuned to match typical @xmath35 observations of galaxies at @xmath37 .",

    "this is also in reasonable agreement with our results here , assuming that single nucleus ulirgs are observed after the first pass or after the coalescence of the nuclei .",
    "the duration , strength , and timing of the observed morphological disturbances depend on the merger orientation and orbital parameters , the gas properties of the initial galaxies , and the presence of dust .",
    "when dust is included , the merger observability time - scales depend most strongly on the gas properties , pericentric distance , and relative orientation . galaxies with high gas fractions have more star - formation along tidal arms , producing stronger asymmetries during the first pass . mergers with large impact parameters have long orbital decay time - scales , and exhibit disturbed morphologies for longer .",
    "retrograde - retrograde mergers also show disturbed morphologies for 50 - 100% longer than prograde - prograde and prograde - retrograde mergers .",
    "we find that the supernova feedback prescription and the total mass of the merging galaxies do not have a strong effect on the overall duration of morphological disturbances .",
    "the relative orientations affect the strength of the morphological disturbances , with the prograde - retrograde and polar orientations showing the strongest disturbances .",
    "the orbital parameters and gas fractions have the strongest influence on the timing of the morphological disturbances .",
    "most of the high gas - fraction ( sbc ) parabolic orbits show morphological disturbances at the first pass and final merger , while the high gas - fraction highly radial orbit and large pericentric distance simulations have weak disturbances at the first pass and stronger disruptions at the final merger . the lower gas - fraction ( g - series )",
    "parabolic orbit simulations experience less star - formation and morphological disturbances during the first pass , and hence are most likely to be detected morphologically during the final merger .",
    "obscuration from dust has a very strong impact on the measured morphologies throughout the merger process until at least 1 gyr after the coalescence of the nuclei .",
    "dust extinction is highest for the central nuclei where the star - formation rates are highest .",
    "because much of the central light is masked by dust , this results in lower @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and higher @xmath1 values during and after the merger .",
    "dust lanes in the remnants can also produce higher asymmetries .",
    "however , the inclusion of dust does not significantly change the morphological disturbance time - scales during the prograde - prograde sbc merger .",
    "our models may overestimate the dust content in the remnants as dust is not destroyed by shock - heating nor is gas removed in a post - merger ` blowout ' by an active galactic nucleus as predicted by other galaxy merger models ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "however , dust destruction is expected to be most important after the final merger , when the star - formation rate and dust production have sufficiently declined .",
    "therefore , while the dust and gas content of our merger remnants may be overestimated , the morphologies and time - scales calculated during the merger are unlikely to be affected by the destruction / removal of dust at late stages .",
    "the observability time - scales clearly depend on the method used to select merger candidates .",
    "the time - scale during which a merging system is a close pair at a particular projected separation is not the same as the time - scale during which the system shows high asymmetries or high @xmath5 values .",
    "the gas - rich sbc mergers have 2 - 4 times longer @xmath50 and @xmath51 than @xmath49 and @xmath94 kpc ) .",
    "the lower gas - fraction g - series simulations , on the other hand , have similar time - scales for @xmath5 , @xmath46 , and @xmath3 disturbances .",
    "although @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the most affected by dust , the @xmath5 time - scale is the least affected by the merger parameters with typical time - scales @xmath95 gyr for the g - series simulations and @xmath96 gyr for the sbc simulations .",
    "the typical @xmath46 time - scales are @xmath97 gyr for the g - series simulations and @xmath98 gyr for the sbc simulations .",
    "the typical @xmath3 time - scales are @xmath95 gyr for the g - series simulations and @xmath99 gyr for the sbc simulations .",
    "thus the @xmath5 time - scales have @xmath24 0.4 gyr dispersion , while the @xmath46 and @xmath3 time - scales have @xmath24 0.8 gyr dispersion .",
    "while more mergers may be identified using asymmetry given the longer asymmetry time - scales , the merger rate calculated using @xmath5 mergers will be less uncertain given the better consistency of the @xmath5 time - scales .",
    "the close pair time - scales depend on the orbital decay times , with the smaller projected separations showing the greatest fractional variability . for @xmath100 kpc , the observability time - scales are @xmath101 gyr for the g - series simulations and @xmath102 gyr for sbc .",
    "these are slightly longer at @xmath103 kpc , with time - scales @xmath104 gyr for the g - series simulations and @xmath105 gyr for sbc . at larger projected radii @xmath69 50 ,",
    "100 @xmath9 kpc , the highly radial orbit and the large pericentric distance parabolic orbit have significantly shorter ( @xmath24 0.3 , 0.8 gyr ) and longer time - scales ( @xmath24 1.4 , 3.0 gyr ) , respectively .",
    "the typical @xmath106 kpc time - scales are @xmath107 gyr for the g3/g2 simulations and @xmath108 gyr for the sbc simulations .",
    "the typical @xmath109 kpc time - scales are @xmath24 1.9 gyr for the g3 simulations and @xmath110 gyr for the sbc simulations . therefore the observability time - scales for close pairs vary by a factor of 4 - 6 at small projected separations and by a factor of 2 - 3 at larger separations .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that these are the observability time - scales for truly merging pairs ( @xmath111 in eqn .",
    "16 ) and does not include the contamination correction for non - merging pairs observed in projection ( @xmath112 in eqn .",
    "close pairs with large projected separations are more likely to be contaminated by non - merging galaxies , so the optimal separation distance is likely to be at intermediate separations between 30 - 50 @xmath9 kpc .    unlike our simulated mergers where we know the merger parameters and initial galaxy properties a priori",
    ", it is generally impossible to recover these for each galaxy merger observed in large surveys of the distant universe .",
    "ideally , one would like to determine an effective observability time - scale for each method of identifying mergers in order to convert the number density of observed mergers observed into a galaxy merger rate .",
    "this effective time - scale should be weighted by the distribution of initial galaxy properties , mass ratios , and orbital parameters predicted for galaxy mergers by cosmological simulations .",
    "our work here is a first step towards determining the mean observability time - scale and has concentrated on the systems most likely to be affected by dusty starbursts , i.e. gas - rich equal mass mergers of discs with small bulges .",
    "while this is significant improvement over previous estimates of the morphological disturbance time - scales , it is not sufficient to convert the observed fraction of morphologically disturbed and paired galaxies into a galaxy merger rate .",
    "our next paper will explore the merger observability time - scales of non - equal mass mergers needed to estimate the effective observability time - scale for a realistic population of mergers and calculate the galaxy merger rate .",
    "galaxy mergers are often assumed to be associated with vigorous starbursts , such as observed for local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( e.g. sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "our results here suggest that the timing of morphological disturbances can be offset from the peak in star - formation rate , especially if the stiff @xmath20 supernova feedback prescription is correct . in general , the maximum morphological disturbances occur before the peaks in the star - formation rate . while asymmetries experience a sharp peak at the first pass lasting 100 - 200 myr , the star - formation rate of the system remains enhanced above the initial rate for significantly longer after the first pass for both supernova feedback models .",
    "asymmetries also peak sharply at the final merger , while the star - formation peaks after the galaxies appear as single object when the nuclei coalesce .",
    "therefore , the objects with highest star - formation rates may not always have the highest asymmetries .",
    "this is particularly true for the stiff @xmath20 supernova feedback models , which experience a long burst at the final merger ( @xmath24 500 myr ) lasting longer than the high asymmetries ( @xmath24 200 myr ) . during both first pass and final merger ,",
    "the majority of the enhanced star formation occurs in the nucleus which makes the quantitative morphologies appear more concentrated but not necessarily disturbed .",
    "if we ignore the effect of dust on the morphologies , @xmath0 correlates directly with the star - formation rate .",
    "because dust lowers the measured @xmath0 value , the dusty sbc final mergers do not show high @xmath5 , while the less - obscured g - series final mergers do ( figs .",
    "[ merg_orient ] , [ merg_mass ] ) .",
    "roughly 75% of the strongest starbursts in the local universe , ulirgs , have quantitatively disturbed morphologies , and two - thirds show multiple nuclei .",
    "therefore the correlation between disturbed morphologies and peak star - formation rates appears to be better than what is implied by our models .",
    "we note that only one of our simulations ( the gas - rich , radial orbit , isothermal feedback simulation sbcrn=0 ) reaches a star - formation rate at the final merger that is comparable to ulirgs .",
    "ulirgs may have higher gas fractions than our models , and often host active nuclei that could destroy or sweep out dust in the central regions during the final merger , both of which would tighten the correlation between disturbed morphologies and high star - formation rates . finally , the star - formation rates of some ulirgs may be overestimated , as some of the infrared luminosity may be from dust - heating by an agn rather than star - formation .",
    "any correlation between high star - formation rates and disturbed morphologies will depend on the star - formation indicator used to calculate the star - formation rate . observed h@xmath113 luminosities and equivalent widths are expected to be highest during the first pass and initial starbursts before the star - forming regions have been enshrouded in dust , while infrared luminosities will peak during the final merger after sufficient amounts of metals and dust have been produced ( jonsson et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the vast majority of our equal - mass gas - rich merger remnants are decidedly disc - like and dusty , even those mergers which started with relatively low gas fractions .",
    "previous studies of these and other equal - mass merger simulations have shown that the mass distribution of star particles follow @xmath114 laws with steep central cusps consistent with or more concentrated than the light profiles of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. cox et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ; naab et al . 2006 ; bournaud , jog , & combes 2005 ) and lie on the fundamental plane ( robertson et al .",
    "only simulations with gas fractions @xmath11 50% ( springel & hernquist 2005 ; robertson et al .",
    "2006a ) or mass ratios less than 1:3 ( naab et al . 2006 ,",
    "bournard et al .",
    "2005 ) have been found to have merger remnants with massive disc components .",
    "the masses of our merger remnants are dominated by the bulge component ; our merger remnants appear disc - like and less concentrated than elliptical galaxies because we examine the @xmath4-band light profiles which are strongly affected by both dust extinction in the central regions and a bright but low - mass disc of young stars .",
    "only models with less dusty remnants ( as produced by @xmath22 supernova feedback ) or models that ignore dust in the remnant produce remnants with high enough @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and low enough @xmath1 values to be called spheroids .",
    "however , even these spheroidal remnants are forming stars at rates @xmath11 1 m@xmath17 yr@xmath47 , and would not be classified as red e / s0 or post - starburst e+a galaxies . if these simulations accurately represent the end stages of the merger process , a number of ` green ' sb galaxies may be merger remnants ( e.g. hammer et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , our models may overestimate the extinction and star - formation during the post - merger stages . destroying dust by shock - heating would not be sufficient to produce true red and dead spheroids , and additional physics such as feedback from an active galactic nucleus may be needed to clear out the gas and kill star formation ( see also khalatyan et al .",
    "the remnants forming the fewest stars and with the least dust are those produced by the lowest mass systems .",
    "but the low - mass remnants are the least centrally concentrated of all the simulated remnants . like their higher mass counterparts ,",
    "the low - mass remnants have more gas ( @xmath24 10@xmath115 m@xmath17 ) and star formation than typical dwarf ellipticals .",
    "we present a morphological analysis of a large suite of gadget n - body / sph equal - mass gas - rich disc galaxy merger simulations which have been processed through the monte - carlo radiative transfer code sunrise . with the resulting images ,",
    "we have examined the dependence of quantitative morphology and projected separation in the sdss @xmath4-band on merger stage , dust , viewing angle , merger orientation and orbital parameters , gas properties , supernova feedback prescription , and total mass .",
    "we have determined the time - scales for quantitative morphological disturbances in the gini coefficient , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , and the time - scale during which close pairs lie at projected separations @xmath116 20 , 30 , 50 , and 100 @xmath9 kpc .",
    "we also examine the merger remnant morphologies and star - formation rates .",
    "@xmath117 all of the equal - mass gas - rich merger simulations experience quantitatively disturbed morphologies in @xmath5 , @xmath46 , and @xmath3 at the first pass and/or the final merger .",
    "this is in good agreement with the morphologies and merger stages of the local ulirg sample used to empirically calibrate these quantities . however , merging galaxies observed between the first pass and final merger or after the coalescence of their nuclei may not show disturbed @xmath5 and asymmetries .",
    "@xmath117 the time - scale during which an equal - mass gas - rich merger may be identified is strongly dependent on the method used to find the merger .",
    "the @xmath5 time - scales are the shortest of the morphological methods , but have the least dependence on the merger parameters with @xmath118 gyr . the asymmetry time - scales vary by a factor of 3 - 4 between @xmath119 gyr , and the @xmath46 time - scales are the longest , with @xmath120 gyr .",
    "the close pair time - scales vary by factor of 2@xmath876 with the orbital parameters , depending on the projected separations adopted . at @xmath100 kpc , the observability time - scales are @xmath121 gyr . at @xmath122 kpc , the observability time - scales are @xmath123 gyr . at @xmath124 kpc ,",

    "@xmath117 the presence of dust has strong impact on the quantitative morphological measurements , lowering @xmath0 and @xmath2 , raising @xmath1 throughout the merger , and raising @xmath3 during the post - merger and remnant stages .",
    "@xmath117 when dust is included , the time - scales for morphological disturbances are most sensitive to the gas fraction of the merging galaxies , their pericentric distance , and relative orientation .",
    "the supernova feedback prescription and the total mass of system do not significantly change the morphological time - scales .",
    "the relative orientations also affect the strength of the morphological disturbances , with prograde - retrograde and polar orientation showing the highest asymmetries .",

    "@xmath117 the timing of morphological disturbances is generally offset from the peak in star - formation rates , with strong morphological disturbances occurring before bursts of merger - induced star - formation and for shorter durations .",
    "hence , not all merger - induced starbursts will exhibit morphological disturbances and vice versa .",
    "the mode of supernova feedback and dust production also play important roles in the correlation between morphological disturbances and observed star - formation indicators .",

    "<S> a key obstacle to understanding the galaxy merger rate and its role in galaxy evolution is the difficulty in constraining the merger properties and time - scales from instantaneous snapshots of the real universe . </S>",
    "<S> the most common way to identify galaxy mergers is by morphology , yet current theoretical calculations of the time - scales for galaxy disturbances are quite crude . </S>",
    "<S> we present a morphological analysis of a large suite of gadget n - body / hydro - dynamical equal - mass gas - rich disc galaxy mergers which have been processed through the monte - carlo radiative transfer code sunrise . with the resulting images , </S>",
    "<S> we examine the dependence of quantitative morphology ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) in the sdss @xmath4-band on merger stage , dust , viewing angle , orbital parameters , gas properties , supernova feedback , and total mass . </S>",
    "<S> we find that mergers appear most disturbed in @xmath5 and asymmetry at the first pass and at the final coalescence of their nuclei , but can have normal quantitative morphologies at other merger stages . </S>",
    "<S> the merger observability time - scales depend on the method used to identify the merger as well as the gas fraction , pericentric distance , and relative orientation of the merging galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> enhanced star formation peaks after and lasts significantly longer than strong morphological disturbances . despite their massive bulges , </S>",
    "<S> the majority of merger remnants appear disc - like and dusty in @xmath4-band light because of the presence of a low - mass star - forming disc .    </S>",
