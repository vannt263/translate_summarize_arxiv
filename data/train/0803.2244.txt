    "d. hofmann e w. meeks proved a beautiful theorem on minimal surfaces , the so - called `` halfspace theorem '' in @xcite : there is no non planar , complete , minimal surface properly immersed in a halfspace of @xmath6 we focus in this paper complete surfaces with constant mean curvature @xmath4 in the product space @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the hyperbolic plane and @xmath3 is the set of real numbers . in the context of @xmath7-surfaces in @xmath1",
    "it is natural to investigate about halfspace type results .    before stating our result we would like to emphasize that , in last years there has been work in @xmath7-surfaces in homogeneous 3-manifolds , in particular in the product space @xmath8 new examples were produced and many theoretical results as well .",

    "the result in @xcite is different in nature from our result because in @xcite , the `` halfspace '' is one side of a horocylinder , while for us , the `` halfspace '' is the mean convex side of the rotational simply connected surface .",
