    "the simplest field theories involving a vector that acquires nonzero vacuum expectation values are the so - called bumblebee models @xcite .",
    "the lorentz violating is trigged by a vector field , called the bumblebee field , whose minimum of the potential gives rise to the background field .",
    "amongst the possible choices for the potential are the smooth quadratic @xcite , the lagrange - multiplier @xcite and the nonpolynomial potentials @xcite .",
    "kosteleck and samuel proposed the usual maxwell - like kinetic term for the bumblebee field and a smooth quadratic potential @xcite .",

    "the quadratic bumblebee lagrangian expanded around the vacuum value @xmath0 has the form of the maxwell lagrangian added with an axial gauge fixing term @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the excitations of the bumblebee field can be cast into two classes : two nambu - goldstone ( ng ) modes , transverse to the vacuum expected value of the bumblebee field , and one massive or longitudinal mode @xcite . at tree level in the linear regime ,",
    "the two ng modes can be identified with the two polarization modes of the photon @xcite . in turn",
    ", the massive mode appears as a tachyonic ghost excitation and the associated hamiltonian of the model is unbounded below @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a appropriated choice of the initial conditions for the field configurations can yield regions of phase space that are ghost - free and have hamiltonian positive @xcite .",
    "an important question is how the quantum effects affect the stability of the ks theory and the propagation of the unphysical modes . in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , the canonical quantization of the ks model in flat minkowski spacetime was addressed .",
    "the stckelberg method was employed to define an extended fock space such that the second - class constraints are converted into the first - class ones . in the restricted fock space for the physical states ,",
    "the free ks model turns out to be unitary and equivalent to the maxwell electrodynamics in the temporal gauge @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the radiative corrections induced by the interaction terms in the ks model were not addressed in the literature yet .    in this letter",

    "the quantum effects are accessed exploring the similarity between the bumblebee model at the linear approximation and the maxwell theory in the axial gauge .",
    "we evaluate the one - loop radiative corrections due to the bumblebee self - energy and we find that no correction for the mass term of the longitudinal mode is generated . however , the transversality condition @xmath1 is not satisfied , which confirms that the massive mode is naturally going to be excited by the interactions terms .",
    "this letter is organized as the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theoretical - model ] , we define and review the main properties of the ks model and study the free propagation of the bumblebee field in the absence of matter . in sec .",
    "[ radiativecorrections ] , we study the one - loop radiative corrections of the bumblebee self - energy . finally , our conclusions , as well as perspectives are outlined in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we begin presenting some classical results on a particular class of bumblebee models , namely the kosteleck - samuel ( ks ) model .",
    "the lagrangian for the ks model that describes the dynamics of the bumblebee field is given by @xcite @xmath2where @xmath3 is a dimensionless positive coupling , @xmath4 is a positive constant with squared mass dimension , @xmath5 is supposed to be a conserved current formed of matter fields that are also the source for the @xmath6 field , and the field - strength tensor @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8    the smooth quadratic potential term @xmath9 is responsible for triggering the mechanism of spontaneous lorentz violations .",

    "@xcite , in theories with spontaneous lorentz violation , the potential propagating modes can be classified into five types : gauge modes , nambu - goldstone ( ng ) , massive modes , lagrange - multiplier modes , or spectator modes . in particular , for the theory defined by the lagrangian density in eq .",
    ", only the ng and massive modes are present .",
    "the ng modes arise if the excitations satisfy the condition @xmath16 , where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "consequently , the massive mode is an excitation associated with a non - minimal value of the potential , and it is observed when @xmath18 .    the stability and the unitarity of the hamiltonian associated with the lagrangian were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . besides the massless ng mode , the ks model also possesses a propagating massive tachyonic excitation which leads to instabilities .",
    "however , one can consistently choose a set of constraints which reduce the phase space to a region where the hamiltonian is positively definite @xcite . in this restricted phase space the tachyon does not propagate and the free model is classically equivalent to the maxwell theory in a nonlinear gauge @xcite . by means of the stckelberg method and a suitable choice of the creation and annihilation operators ,",
    "it is possible to define a reduced fock space which is ghost - free and whose physical states have positive hamiltonian @xcite .    in the sequel , we use the lagrangian approach to show that no physical propagating massive mode can be achieved .",
    "since our main objective is to study the dynamics of the bumblebee field @xmath6 around the vacuum , we adopt the following decomposition @xmath19    in terms of the excitation @xmath20 , the bumblebee lagrangian can be rewritten as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a field strength for the bumblebee excitation @xcite .",

    "the equation of motion reduces to @xmath28    since the background vector @xmath0 defines a preferred direction in space , we can split the excitations @xmath20 into transverse @xmath29 and longitudinal @xmath30 modes by means of the orthogonal projection operators @xmath31 such that @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , so that @xmath35 . with these definitions",

    "it turned out that the self - energy is not transversal .",
    "this is related to the lack of gauge symmetry which allows excitations for the massive mode .",
    "furthermore , the quadratic part of the effective action is free of non - local terms and renormalizable at one - loop order . even though the smooth",
    "quadratic potential breaks the gauge symmetry , no radiative corrections was produced for the ng mode mass or for the massive mode . as a matter of fact , the massive mode remains propagating at one - loop order , which indicates that the non - physical mode detected in the analysis of ks model ( tree - level ) @xcite persists at the quantum level .    as future developments of the quantum features of the bumblebee electrodynamics we point out the analysis of process involving coupling with a matter source .",
