    "perhaps the most perplexing and long - standing problem associated with galactic and cluster cooling flows is the uncertain physical nature and spatial distribution of the gas that cools .",
    "the apparent absence of large masses of cooled gas in elliptical galaxies has led some to argue that little or no cooling actually occurs and to postulate some source of heating that offsets the radiative losses in x - ray emission .",
    "but the energy required to balance radiative losses is prohibitively large and appropriate heating sources may not be universally available .",
    "if the expected radiative cooling actually occurs , two questions arise : ( 1 ) what is the nature of the objects that condense from the hot gas ? and",
    "( 2 ) where is most of the cooled mass located in the galaxy ? regarding the first question ,",
    "a variety of physical arguments support the hypothesis , or even the inevitability , of low mass star formation ( fabian , nulsen & canizares 1982 ; thomas 1986 ; cowie & binney 1988 ; vedder , trester , & canizares 1988 ; sarazin & ashe 1989 ; ferland , fabian & johnstone 1994 ; mathews & brighenti 1999 ) . here",
    "we shall address the second question in the context of cooling flows in elliptical galaxies where the known stellar mass and light profiles strongly constrain the spatial distribution of cooled gas .",
    "we adopt the generally accepted hypothesis that only stars of very low mass ( e.g. @xmath5 @xmath6 ) form in cooling flows ( e.g. ferland , fabian & johnstone 1994 ) , so that the mass to light ratio of the young stellar population formed from the cooling gas is essentially infinite . in view of the difficulties we encounter with this hypothesis , described below",
    ", it seems more likely that the stellar population formed from cooled gas extends to somewhat more massive stars that are optically luminous .",
    "our gas dynamical models for the evolution of hot interstellar gas in giant ellipticals indicate that the origin of the gas varies with galactic radius .",
    "most of the gas in the inner , optically luminous regions originates from the ejected envelopes of evolving stars ; gas in the outer halo is supplied by cosmological secondary infall or tidal acquisitions from neighboring galaxies ( mathews & brighenti 1998b ) .",
    "circumgalactic gas around massive ellipticals is enriched by type ii supernovae that accompanied early star formation .",
    "the variability of circumgalactic gas among luminous ellipticals is responsible for some of the enormous dispersion in x - ray luminosity @xmath7 among ellipticals of similar optical luminosity @xmath8 ( mathews & brighenti 1998a ) .",
    "since the hot interstellar gas in a bright elliptical emits observable x - rays , it is clearly losing energy .",
    "however , as the gas loses energy it is compressed toward the galactic center by gravitational forces and @xmath9 work maintains the high temperatures observed , @xmath10 k , producing a galactic cooling flow .",
    "the positive interstellar temperature gradients typically observed within a few effective radii are often cited as evidence of radiative cooling in a cooling flow , but this cooling is due instead to the mixing of somewhat cooler , locally virialized gas ejected from stars with hotter gas arriving from larger galactic radii ( mathews & brighenti 1998b ; brighenti & mathews 1998 , 1999a ) .",
    "if large entropy fluctuations are present in the hot gas , catastrophic cooling can occur at any radius in the flow .",
    "regions of low entropy ( low temperature , high density ) radiate more and cool sooner .",
    "the amplitude distribution of entropy fluctuations in the interstellar gas determines the radius where cooling mass dropout occurs in the cooling flow . for example , if the entropy in some region in the flow is only slightly less than in the ambient flow , the differential radiative cooling will be small and the region will cool out of the flow at small galactic radii ; conversely , localized regions with entropy much lower than the ambient flow cool rapidly and deposit their mass at large radii . some possible sources of interstellar entropy variations are stellar winds , explosions of type ia supernovae , non - uniform snii heating at early times , and mergers with small , gas - rich galaxies .    the total rate that mass cools and drops out of the flow is closely related to the x - ray luminosity @xmath7 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity can be approximately expressed as the product of the total cooling rate @xmath11 and the enthalpy per gram in the hot gas , or @xmath12 here we have used data from the giant virgo elliptical ngc 4472 : @xmath13 k ; @xmath14 ; @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath16 are reasonably constant over the hubble time , a mass @xmath17 @xmath6 of cold gas is expected to condense from the hot ism somewhere within ngc 4472 .",
    "although this mass is very large , it is only about 4 percent of the total stellar mass in ngc 4472 today .",
    "the mass that cools can therefore be ignored if it is widely distributed throughout the galactic volume . however , the central concentration of h@xmath18 emission in ellipticals ( e.g. macchetto et al .",
    "1996 ) suggests that the cooling is concentrated toward the galactic center where the interstellar density is highest and the bulk of the x - ray energy is emitted .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to explore a variety of options for the mass dropout profile of cooled gas in bright ellipticals appropriately constrained by the known radial distributions of total stellar and non - baryonic mass .",
    "the radial mass dropout profile of cooled gas can not be determined from first principles because the distribution and amplitude of the entropy and magnetic fluctuations in the hot gas are unknown and difficult to evaluate from simple physical arguments .",
    "nevertheless , the total mass of cooled gas inside an effective ( half - light ) radius @xmath3 must be consistent with the mass to light ratio determined from stellar velocities and with the total mass inferred from x - ray observations within @xmath3 .",
    "assuming that the stellar mass to light ratio is uniform with radius , the stellar mass @xmath19 and the x - ray mass @xmath20 appear to be in nearly perfect agreement for two bright virgo ellipticals in the range @xmath21 ( brighenti & mathews 1997a ) .",
    "because of constraints on the mass distribution of cooled gas provided by x - ray and stellar dynamical observations , galactic cooling flows provide a critical venue for testing the physics of mass deposition in cooling flows .",
    "the mass of cold ( @xmath22 k ) gas @xmath23 actually observed in ellipticals is many orders of magnitude less than the total cooled mass estimated above .",
    "for example , neither hi nor h@xmath24 gas has been observed in ngc 4472 , only upper limits , @xmath25 @xmath6 ( bregman , roberts & giovanelli 1988 ; braine , henkel & wiklind 1988 ) .",
    "if stars form they must either be indistinguishable from the old stellar population or non - luminous .",
    "we explore here the possibility that most of the cooled gas forms dense baryonic clouds or stars that are dark at optical and radio frequencies .",
    "the very low mass stars advanced by ferland , fabian & johnstone ( 1994 ) satisfy this invisibility criterion , while the star formation models of mathews & brighenti ( 1999 ) indicate that ( luminous ) stars of mass @xmath26 @xmath6 can form in galactic cooling flows .",
    "x - ray studies indicate significant masses of cold , absorbing gas in cluster and galactic cooling flows ( e.g. white et al .",
    "1991 ; allen et al . 1993 ; fabian et al .",
    "1994 ; allen & fabian 1997 ; buote 1999 ) , but these results are inconsistent with the absence of radio frequency emission from the cold gas ( braine & dupraz 1994 ; donahue & vogt 1997 ) and should be regarded as controversial until this inconsistency is resolved .",
    "even taken at face value , the total mass of cooled gas implied by the x - ray absorption in cluster cooling flows is typically only a small fraction of the total mass that should have cooled in a hubble time ( allen & fabian 1997 ; wise & sarazin 1999 ) , implying that most of the cooled gas may have formed stars . if cooled gas forms into small stars , these stars will have apogalatica near their point of origin where they will spend most of their orbital time .",
    "we shall assume that the gas mass that cools and drops out of the flow contributes optically dark ( stellar ) mass at the radius where the cooling occurred .    in the following we describe a series of gas dynamical calculations for the evolution of x - ray emitting interstellar gas over the hubble time and",
    "investigate a variety of assumptions about the radial distribution of optically dark cooled gas . to be specific ,",
    "we compare our models with the well - observed massive elliptical ngc 4472 .",
    "we find that the mass of cooled gas contributes significantly to dynamical mass to light determinations within @xmath3 based on stellar velocities .",
    "the e2 elliptical ngc 4472 is a luminous , slowly rotating [ @xmath27 galaxy in the virgo cluster . with an adopted distance @xmath28 mpc ,",
    "its optical luminosity is @xmath29 @xmath30 and its half light or effective radius @xmath31 is @xmath32 kpc ( faber et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the total stellar mass @xmath33 @xmath6 is found from the mass to light ratio @xmath34 determined by van der marel ( 1991 ) with a two - integral stellar distribution function .",
    "this mass to light ratio is appropriate to the galactic region within about 0.4@xmath3 where stellar velocities are well determined , although the mass determined from x - ray observations suggests that @xmath35 remains constant to at least @xmath3 ( brighenti & mathews 1997a ) .",
    "if @xmath35 is spatially constant , the stellar mass also has a de vaucouleurs profile . within a central core or break radius @xmath36 ( @xmath37 pc ) the stellar density profile flattens ( faber et al .",
    "1997 ) , but we shall not consider this small feature here .",
    "ngc 4472 contains a central black hole of mass @xmath38 @xmath6 ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) .    the total mass distribution in luminous ellipticals can most easily be determined from the radial variation of density and temperature in the hot interstellar gas , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the interstellar density and temperature profiles in ngc 4472 .",
    "the filled circles in figure 1 are _ einstein _",
    "hri observations ( trinchieri , fabbiano & canizares 1986 ) and open circles are rosat hri and pspc data from irwin & sarazin ( 1996 ) ( also see forman et al . 1993 ) . the @xmath39 and @xmath40 profiles have been fit with analytic curves as described by brighenti & mathews ( 1997a ) .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium in the hot interstellar gas is an excellent approximation since the cooling flow velocity is very subsonic .",
    "the total mass interior to radius @xmath41 determined from x - ray observations is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the proton mass and @xmath44 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "the last term , representing the possibility of magnetic pressure @xmath45 , is negative if @xmath46 as seems likely .",
    "if the magnetic term is important but not included , the total mass will be underestimated .",
    "assuming @xmath47 , the total mass @xmath20 in ngc 4472 is shown with a solid line in figure 1b .    in the outer halo , @xmath48 ,",
    "the total mass is dominated by the dark halo .",
    "the dark halo mass distribution in ngc 4472 can be approximated with an nfw halo profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) of virial mass @xmath49 @xmath6 although the observed halo is somewhat less centrally peaked than nfw ( brighenti & mathews 1999a ) .",
    "within @xmath3 the contribution of the dark nfw halo mass in the model is small ; for example at @xmath50 the total mass to light ratio is @xmath51 , only 10 percent greater than the dynamic value 9.2 determined in @xmath52 .",
    "it is remarkable that the total mass found from the x - ray data @xmath20 is nearly identical to the expected dynamical mass @xmath19 ( based on stellar velocities and @xmath53 ) in the range @xmath21 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "an almost identical agreement in this radius range is indicated by x - ray observations of another bright virgo elliptical , ngc 4649 ( brighenti & mathews 1997a ) . in this important region",
    "the hot gas is confined by the _ stellar _ potential .",
    "the excellent agreement of the stellar and x - ray masses supports the consistency of two radically different mass determinations : from stellar velocities and from the radial equilibrium of hot interstellar gas .",
    "the apparent agreement of the x - ray and stellar masses in this range of galactic radii also indicates that the hydrostatic support of the hot gas is not strongly influenced by local magnetic fields and rotation .",
    "however , it is not obvious why @xmath35 would be constant with galactic radius , particularly when the cooling dropout mass is considered , and why the agreement between stellar dynamic and x - ray masses no longer obtains in the central regions @xmath54 . in this central region",
    "the total mass indicated by the x - ray observations in figure 1 is considerably less than the expected mass based on an assumed de vaucouleurs profile and constant mass to light ratio .",
    "this type of deviation could be due to magnetic or other non - thermal pressure in this region , to rotation , or to local cooling dropout in the hot interstellar gas .",
    "the lower mean temperature in cooling regions lowers the total apparent gas temperature and results in an underestimate of the total internal mass ( equation 1 ) .",
    "we assume that currently available _ einstein _ and rosat observations are accurate in the central region of ngc 4472 , @xmath54 .",
    "these observations have been reduced assuming no ( non - galactic ) photoelectric absorption by low temperature gas in the central regions .",
    "if x - ray absorption is present , the true hot gas density would be more centrally peaked than shown in figure 1 and the total mass indicated by the x - ray observations would increase .",
    "buote ( 1999 ) finds that two - temperature models fit the x - ray spectrum for ngc 4472 quite well .",
    "the two temperatures do not necessarily need to be spatially mixed ; they could also approximately represent the range of the radial temperature variation observed in ngc 4472 . in buote s two temperature model ,",
    "only the cooler component ( @xmath55 kev located in @xmath56 ) requires an absorption column @xmath57 @xmath58 in excess of the galactic value .",
    "however , the influence of cold gas having this column density on the hot gas density plotted in figure 1 is small . for a worst case example",
    ", suppose that absorbing material with column density @xmath57 @xmath58 is in a disk oriented perpendicular to the line of sight and that this disk absorbs _ all _ x - rays from the back side of the galaxy .",
    "the radius of this disk would be @xmath59 pc if it contained the maximum mass @xmath60 @xmath6 allowed by co and hi observations ( bregman , roberts & giovanelli 1988 ; braine , henkel & wiklind 1997 ) or 20 kpc if it contained all of the gas that has cooled , @xmath61 @xmath6 .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness within the opaque disk would be reduced by 2 , but the corresponding gas density would be lowered by only @xmath62 since the volume emissivity @xmath63 .",
    "such a small correction in the density ( gradient ) could not account for the large mass discrepancy between the x - ray mass and the stellar dynamical mass shown in figure 1 within 0.1@xmath3 .",
    "the densities and temperatures in figure 1 were determined from x - ray data assuming the abundance of the hot gas is uniformly solar . since the gas is likely to be more metal rich at smaller galactic radii ( matsushita 1997 ; brighenti & mathews 1999b ) , an allowance for this gradient would tend to lower the derived density gradient and the internal mass , _ increasing _ the discrepancy in @xmath64 in figure 1 by a small amount . in the following discussion we shall ignore the relatively small possible influence of absorption or metallicity gradients on the results shown in figure 1",
    "the hydrodynamical models we use in this paper are similar to those in our recent papers ( e.g. brighenti & mathews 1999a ) so we provide only a brief review here .",
    "hot interstellar gas in ellipticals has a dual origin : ( i ) mass loss from an evolving old stellar population and ( ii ) secondary infall into the overdensity perturbation that formed the galaxy group within which the elliptical formed by early merging events . for a given set of cosmological parameters , dark and baryonic matter flow toward an overdensity region .",
    "the dark matter forms an nfw halo , growing in size with time .",
    "spherical geometry is assumed . within the accretion shock at time @xmath65 gyr ,",
    "when enough baryons have accumulated , we form the current de vaucouleurs stellar profile and release the energy of all type ii supernovae according to a salpeter imf ( slope : @xmath66 , mass limits : @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xmath6 ) .",
    "all stars greater than 8 @xmath6 produce type ii supernovae each of energy @xmath69 ergs .",
    "we assume that a fraction @xmath70 of this energy is delivered to the internal energy of the gas .",
    "we have shown ( brighenti & mathews 1999b ) that such a galaxy formation scheme can work in a variety of cosmologies : flat or low density , with or without a lambda term .",
    "the evolution of gas within the optical effective radius @xmath3 , of most interest here , is insensitive to these cosmological parameters . for simplicity",
    "therefore we assume a simple flat universe with @xmath71 , @xmath72 km s@xmath73 mpc@xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we characterize the dark halo with an nfw profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) having a virial mass @xmath49 @xmath6 at the current time @xmath75 gyrs .",
    "the models we discuss here are identical to the standard model of ( brighenti & mathews 1999a ) except we now use a finer central spatial zoning ( 65 pc for the innermost zone ) , a snii efficiency @xmath70 , and a mass `` dropout '' function @xmath76 with more adjustable parameters ( see below ) .",
    "our objective is to seek solutions of the gasdynamical equations including mass dropout that jointly satisfy several observational constraints at time @xmath77 : ( i ) the observed hot gas density , temperature and x - ray surface brightness profiles , ( ii ) the known dynamical mass in the galactic center usually attributed to a massive black hole , ( iii ) the apparent dynamical mass to light ratio @xmath34 determined in @xmath52 , and ( iv ) an apparent internal mass @xmath20 in @xmath78 based on equation ( 1 ) that agrees with the constant-@xmath79 de vaucouleurs profile as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the baryonic component in our models has a complex evolution .",
    "much of the initial baryonic mass is consumed in creating the stellar system .",
    "when the type ii supernova energy is released , a significant mass of gas is expelled as a galactic wind .",
    "after these early events , the interstellar gas is re - established and sustained by stellar mass loss and by inflow of circumgalactic gas ( secondary infall ) , most of which was previously enriched and expelled by snii .",
    "we assume that the stars form during a short epoch that can be described by a single burst salpeter imf as discussed above .",
    "the stellar mass loss rate for this imf varies as @xmath80 where @xmath81^{-1.3}$ ] sec@xmath73 .",
    "although galactic stars form at @xmath82 gyr , their mass loss contribution to the ambient interstellar gas is assumed to begin at a later time , @xmath65 gyrs . since",
    "galactic stars have been enriched by supernova ejecta , the single burst model can not be strictly correct , but our approximation @xmath83 is consistent with several early starbursts closely spaced in time and allows for metal enrichment of old galactic stars that are not in the first single - burst population . if the de vaucouleurs profile is a result of largely dissipationless merging , some or most of the star formation must have occurred at a time @xmath84 before the important merging events at @xmath65 gyrs . by taking @xmath85 we reduce by @xmath86 @xmath6 the total amount of gas ejected by stars within the galactic potential .",
    "we recognize the inconsistencies in these approximations of complex stellar formation and dynamical processes that are poorly understood .",
    "however , once the galaxy is formed , we follow the interstellar gas dynamical evolution in full detail , conserving mass and energy .    continued heating by type ia supernova",
    "is assumed to vary inversely with time , snu@xmath87 snu@xmath88@xmath89 , where the current rate , snu@xmath90 snia per 100 yrs per @xmath91 @xmath30 , is near the lower limit of observed values , snu@xmath92 ( cappellaro et al . 1997 ) , as required to maintain the low interstellar iron abundance .    for the models discussed here the equation of continuity includes a `` mass dropout '' term : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the time for gas to cool locally by radiative losses at constant pressure ( see , e. g. sarazin & ashe 1989 ) .",
    "the cooling is assumed to be instantaneous without advection in the cooling flow , i.e. @xmath95 , although in practice this inequality may not always be satisfied . while this type of cooling dropout has been widely used in past models ,",
    "there is no adequate physical model for mass dropout .",
    "clearly , the gas must cool somewhere  the emission of x - rays indicates a large net energy ( and mass ) loss from the interstellar medium .",
    "when small regions of low entropy cool , the pressure remains constant since the sound crossing time is much less than the flow time .",
    "following fabian , nulsen & canizares ( 1982 ) and ferland , fabian , & johnstone ( 1994 ) , we assume that cooled gas converts to a second population of optically dark , low mass stars . regarding h@xmath18 emission as a tracer for the cooling gas , mathews & brighenti ( 1999 ) have shown that the cooling occurs at a multitude ( @xmath96 ) of cooling sites distributed throughout the inner galaxy and that only stars with mass @xmath97 can form at each cooling site .",
    "this is supported by the observed absence of young massive stars and snii in elliptical galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , in the following discussion we assume that the maximum stellar mass in the dropout population is sufficiently low that the optical light from these stars is unobservable .",
    "we expect cooling and low mass star formation to be concentrated within at least 2 kpc , which is the observed extent of h@xmath18 emission in ngc 4472 ( macchetto et al .",
    "while the region containing optical emission lines provides a natural guideline for selecting the dropout profile , we consider a wider range of constant or variable dropout coefficients @xmath76 parameterized by @xmath98 which concentrates the cooling within radius @xmath99 .",
    "note that even when @xmath100 is constant , the mass dropout term is spatially concentrated , @xmath101 .",
    "in a series of recent papers in this journal we have presented evolutionary cooling flow models for ngc 4472 that agree quite well with the observed distributions of interstellar gas density , temperature and metallicity ( brighenti & mathews 1999a ; 1999b ) , particularly at intermediate and large radii . since the total mass of cooled gas in these calculations was only a few percent of the stellar mass , the gravitational contribution of cooled gas was ignored , even in models including mass dropout . for a better understanding of the inner galaxy",
    ", we now include the gravity of all gas , both hot and cold , except when specifically noted . in this section",
    "we begin with models having @xmath102 everywhere , so that cooling to low temperatures occurs in a small central region , then we investigate models in which @xmath100 is constant throughout the cooling flow .",
    "we begin by considering a perfectly homogeneous interstellar flow in which all the gas reaches the central computational zone ( @xmath104 pc ) or its neighboring zones where it then cools to @xmath105 k. for comparison we discuss two cases : in model 1 we ignore the gravity of this cooled gas ; in model 2 ( and subsequent models ) we include its gravitational influence on the flow .",
    "the mass of gas that cools into the central gridzone is dynamically equivalent to a massive black hole , but we do not necessarily regard our calculation as a realistic model for black hole formation . in figure 2a",
    "we illustrate the radial variation of gas density and temperature for models 1 and 2 after the interstellar gas has evolved to @xmath106 gyrs .",
    "several global parameters for these and subsequent models are listed in table 1 .",
    "when the gravity of the cooled gas is considered ( model 2 ) , the interstellar gas within a few kpc of the galactic center is compressed and sharply heated in the local potential .",
    "such hot central thermal cores are not generally observed ( but see colbert & mushotzky 1998 ) .",
    "the central mass in both models , @xmath107 @xmath6 is about 16 times larger than the black hole mass found in ngc 4472 , @xmath38 @xmath6 ( magorrian et al .",
    "for these reasons neither model 1 nor 2 provides a realistic interstellar mass distribution for this galaxy .",
    "rosat band x - ray surface brightness profiles @xmath108 for models 1 and 2 are shown in figure 2b and the total rosat band luminosities are listed in table 1 . for model 1",
    "the x - ray brightness peaks strongly in the galactic center , diverging from the observations within about 3 kpc ; it was just this sort of disagreement that initially led to the assumption of distributed mass dropout in cooling flows ( thomas 1986 ; vedder , trester , & canizares 1988 ; sarazin & ashe 1989 ) .",
    "if the efficiency of heating by early snii were lowered , models 1 and 2 could be made to agree better with @xmath109 observations in @xmath110 kpc , but the computed @xmath109 would rise even further above the observations within a few kpc .",
    "the x - ray luminosities @xmath7 for models 1 and 2 listed in table 1 are unreliable in part because of numerical inaccuracies caused by the extremely steep variation of gas temperature and density in the central 2 or 3 computational zones .",
    "this numerical difficulty is common to all cooling flows that proceed to the very center of the galaxy before cooling , for any reasonable central grid spacing . since more @xmath9 work is done on the flow in model 2 ( where the gravity of cooled gas is included )",
    ", we expect that @xmath7 should also be larger than for model 1",
    ". the opposite sense of the change in @xmath7 shown in table 1 evidently results from numerical inaccuracies near the central singularity where zone to zone variations are no longer linear .",
    "if the gas has not cooled before flowing into the core ( @xmath111 pc ) , as in models 1 and 2 , a significant fraction of the total x - ray emission should come from this very central region , again in disagreement with observations .    in models 1 and 2 a sphere of cold ( @xmath112 k ) , dense gas accumulates in the central gridzones and grows in mass and size over the hubble time .",
    "this sphere is an unrealistic artifact of our computational assumptions .",
    "therefore , to explore further the central numerical difficulty with @xmath7 encountered in models 1 and 2 , we considered two additional models using higher spatial resolution ( radius of central zone is only 15 pc ) , both of which include the gravitational influence of cooled gas .",
    "the first model ( model 2.1 ) is similar to model 2 with @xmath102 in all zones . in the second model ( model 2.2 )",
    "we set @xmath102 in all zones except the central zone where @xmath113 .",
    "model 2.2 is the appropriate limit of the series of models discussed below in which the cooling dropout is more and more centrally concentrated .",
    "while the flow in @xmath114 kpc is very similar in models 2.1 and 2.2 , the behaviour at smaller radii is quite different .",
    "for example the flow parameters for model 2.1 at 100 pc and @xmath75 gyrs are : @xmath115 k , @xmath116 @xmath117 , and @xmath118 km s@xmath73 . at the same radius and time for model 2.2 the flow is quite different : @xmath119 k , @xmath120 @xmath117 , and @xmath121 km s@xmath73 . at projected radius @xmath122 pc , the rosat x - ray surface brightness in model 2.2 is 20 times larger than model 2.1 and the total rosat x - ray luminosity integrated over the entire cooling flow in model 2.2 is larger by a factor 32 .",
    "the differences between these two models result from upstream propagation of information about the central boundary conditions made possible by subsonic flow near the origin .",
    "fortunately , these numerical and physical difficulties near the origin do not arise in more realistic cooling flows discussed below in which @xmath123 at larger galactic radii .      while solutions of the gasdynamical equations provide the temperature as a function of physical radius @xmath39",
    ", the observed temperature @xmath124 is an emission - weighted mean temperature along the line of sight at projected radius @xmath125 .",
    "for symmetric galaxies and at small galactic radii , these two temperatures are nearly identical because of the steep radial variation in x - ray emissivity .",
    "the variation of temperature with physical radius @xmath126 in the background flow is shown with light solid lines in figure 2a .    in the presence of spatially distributed cooling dropout",
    ", the local temperature is an emission - weighted mean of the background ( uncooled ) gas and the cooling regions .",
    "cooling is assumed to occur at a large number of cooling sites where the gas remains in pressure equilibrium as it cools , apparently unrestricted by magnetic stresses ( see mathews & brighenti 1999 for details ) .",
    "the heavy solid lines in figure 2a show the mean apparent temperature @xmath127 including contributions from locally cooling regions , @xmath128 where @xmath16 is the background flow temperature and the slowly - varying functions @xmath129 are plotted in brighenti & mathews ( 1998 ) .",
    "note that the effective temperature is independent of the local gas density .",
    "the temperature that is actually observed is an average of @xmath130 along the line of sight ; this temperature @xmath131 is shown with dotted lines in figure 2a .",
    "lacking an acceptable physical model for spatially distributed mass dropout in galactic cooling flows , we are at liberty to choose any variation for the dropout coefficient @xmath76 , appropriately constrained _ a posteriori _ by the known dynamical mass from stellar velocities , the x - ray mass , the central black hole mass and the observed radial variation of hot gas density , temperature and x - ray surface brightness .",
    "it is natural to begin with constant @xmath100 solutions similar to those considered by sarazin & ashe ( 1989 ) in their steady state cooling flow solutions . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the mass of cooled gas remains at the cooling site where it contributes to the gravitational potential .    in the central panels of figure 2a we illustrate the hot interstellar gas density and temperature that results after @xmath75 gyrs assuming uniform @xmath137 and 4 ;",

    "we compare the radial distribution of stellar and dark halo mass with the distributed dropout mass that results after 13 gyrs with @xmath137 and 4 . the de vaucouleurs `` stellar '' mass profile in figure 3",
    "is constructed assuming uniform @xmath34 .    as @xmath100 increases from 1 to 4 , the background hot gas density ( light solid lines in fig .",
    "2a ) decreases and its radial gradient flattens , causing a rise in temperature to provide enough pressure to support the cooling flow atmosphere .",
    "note that the total dropped - out mass within @xmath142 decreases with larger @xmath100 ( figure 3 and table 1 ) .",
    "although more overall cooling dropout occurs as @xmath100 increases , most of this cooling occurs at very large @xmath41 and , somewhat paradoxically , less gas remains for dropout closer to the galactic center , @xmath56 .",

    "2a ) is less sensitive to @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath137 solution ( model 3 ) is preferred for its fit to observed temperatures while the @xmath113 solution ( model 4 ) agrees better with the observed density in @xmath143 kpc and almost exactly with the x - ray surface brightness ( fig .",
    "in addition , the centrally concentrated dropped out mass in the @xmath137 solution ( model 3 ) contributes a larger fraction of the dynamical mass in @xmath144 and the total mass within the central gridzone ( @xmath104 pc ) is almost equal to the known mass of the black hole in ngc 4472 ( table 1 ) .",
    "evidently , cooled masses in models with @xmath145 would exceed the central dark mass observed .    for both values of @xmath100 considered ,",
    "the dropped out mass listed in table 1 contributes appreciably to the total mass within @xmath146 . when both old stellar and dropout mass are included , the @xmath35 values at @xmath142 shown in table 1  12.19 and 11.21  exceed both the dynamical value @xmath34 found by van der marel ( 1991 ) within @xmath147 and the value @xmath148 in our models which includes a small additional contribution of non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "to quantify the influence of the dark baryonic dropout mass on the mass to light ratio we include in table 1 an entry for @xmath149 @xmath150 where @xmath151 @xmath6 is the combined mass of luminous stars and dark halo matter at @xmath142 and @xmath152 also includes the dropout mass within this radius .",
    "since our computed total mass @xmath153 exceeds the observed dynamical value 9.2 ( and also 10.18 ) , to be fully consistent we should have chosen @xmath154 for the old stellar population ( see below ) , provided @xmath35 for stars produced from the cooled gas is infinite as we have assumed .",
    "if these constant @xmath100 models are physically appropriate , the agreement between @xmath20 and @xmath19 in @xmath78 , as shown in figure 1 ( and for ngc 4649 ) , is surprising since @xmath155 and @xmath156 differ by 10 - 40 percent ( table 1 ) for the constant @xmath100 models .",
    "this suggests that the mass to light ratio of the dropout stellar population is not infinite as we have assumed , but comparable with that of the old stellar population .",
    "we now seek evolutionary gasdynamical solutions with variable dropout coefficients @xmath76 that strongly concentrate the mass dropout in the inner galaxy , @xmath56 .",

    "the mass dropout in these three models is progressively more concentrated toward the galactic center . the results for model 5 , for which the dropout scale length is very large , @xmath161 kpc , are similar in most respects to those of model 4 except the massive dropout in the outer galaxy is no longer present . in particular",

    "the apparent density and @xmath109 ( heavy solid lines ) are considerably greater than observed values in @xmath163 kpc , although the projected apparent temperature is a reasonable fit to the ngc 4472 data .",
    "the radial distribution of dropout mass for model 6 is shown in figure 3 . from table 1",
    "the total ( old stars , halo and dropout ) mass to light ratio at @xmath142 is @xmath164 , 29 percent higher than van der marel s value and 22 percent greater than the corresponding value for our background model galaxy .    also shown in figures 2a and 2b are similar results for model 7 in which the mass dropout , now approximated with a gaussian , is concentrated within @xmath165 pc .",
    "model 7 is constructed so that most of the mass dropout occurs in @xmath166 , corresponding to the region of apparent disagreement between @xmath167 and @xmath168 in figure 1 .",
    "it is of interest that the gas density and @xmath109 within 1 kpc for model 7 , where the dropout is greatest , exceeds those of model 2 in which there is no dropout at all .",

    "for model 2 without distributed dropout the inward moving gas velocity increases through the entire region illustrated and shocks at @xmath169 kpc . in the presence of dropout ,",

    "the dropout mass for model 7 shown in figure 3 equals that of the old population stellar mass at @xmath171 kpc ( @xmath172 ) . for these reasons model 7 seems less satisfactory than model 6 , but neither is as generally successful as model 3 ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "although increased mass dropout can decrease the x - ray surface brightness @xmath109 , as when uniform @xmath100 increased from 1 to 4 ( models 3 and 4 in fig .",
    "2b ) , this is not always the case .",
    "when the dropout is concentrated more toward the galactic center , @xmath109 actually increases , as in the transition from model 6 to 7 .",
    "it is interesting to determine the influence of distributed dropout on the total apparent mass @xmath20 found from the model by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium ( equation 1 ) . due to the contribution of low temperature cooling regions to the total x - ray emission , @xmath39 and",
    "therefore @xmath20 is always lower than the true mass @xmath173 in cooling dropout regions .",
    "a difference in this sense is apparent in table 1 at @xmath146 for models 3 - 7 ; this is similar to the mass discrepancy in figure 1 at @xmath54 .",
    "the high central apparent gas density and surface brightness for model 6 shown in figures 2a and 2b are obvious problems for this model .",
    "however , the gas density can be reduced if a strong magnetic field or other non - thermal energy density is present in @xmath174 kpc .",
    "dynamically important magnetic fields may also be required to fit the x - ray data of ngc 4636 ( brighenti & mathews 1997a ) and may be generally expected in luminous ellipticals ( mathews & brighenti 1997 ; godon , soker & white 1998 ) .",
    "additional non - thermal pressure support is also implied for model 6 since the effect of central cooling dropout fails to lower the apparent mass @xmath20 below the actual mass @xmath175 as much as the observed deviation shown in figure 1 .",
    "like many bright ellipticals , ngc 4472 has a weak non - thermal radio source within the central @xmath176 kpc , indicating @xmath177 @xmath178 g ( ekers & kolanyi 1978 ) .    for all calculated models in table 1 with distributed dropout ,",
    "the total mass @xmath179 significantly exceeds the mass of the old stellar population plus dark halo @xmath180 throughout the inner galaxy , indicating that dropout material makes an important additional contribution to the total mass .",
    "however , the apparent mass @xmath167 determined from equation ( 1 ) is less than @xmath175 in the inner galaxy and , for model 6 , can also be less than @xmath181 .",
    "of particular interest is the region @xmath182",
    "( i.e. , @xmath183 ) in figure 1 .",
    "although the agreement in figure 1 is excellent in this region , for models 6 and 7 the total mass is larger than @xmath173 and values of @xmath184 in table 1 suggest that the dropped out mass contributes 25 - 35 percent of the total mass in this region .",
    "therefore , if the dropout mass is optically dark , the true stellar mass to light ratio of the old stellar population must be @xmath185 rather than the value @xmath34 found by van der marel which includes the dropout mass .    to investigate such a possibly more self - consistent old stellar component",
    ", we consider model 8 based on the same @xmath76 used in model 6 , but with @xmath186 for the old stellar population .",
    "for additional consistency in model 8 , @xmath187 is increased by the ratio of assumed stellar mass to light ratios 9.2/6 = 1.53 as described below ; the total stellar mass ejected is identical to that in model 6 .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the dropout mass profile for model 8 .",
    "the apparent density , temperature and @xmath109 profiles for model 8 shown in figures 4a and 4b are very similar to those of model 6 , so this adjustment of the stellar @xmath35 has had little effect .",
    "the radial mass profiles of models 6 and 8 are compared in figure 5 . in this plot",
    "the open circles show the observed x - ray mass @xmath20 for ngc 4472 using equation ( 1 ) and the solid lines shows @xmath20 based on equation ( 1 ) using @xmath40 and @xmath39 from the models .",
    "the dashed lines show @xmath141 and the dotted lines are the stellar mass @xmath19 based on a de vaucouleurs profile with @xmath34 in the upper panel ( model 6 ) and @xmath186 in the lower panel ( model 8) .",
    "the superiority of model 8 is evident from the closer agreement between the x - ray mass data points for ngc 4472 and the solid line for that model .",
    "this agreement for model 8 would be even closer in the range @xmath188 if we had used a dark halo mass profile less centrally peaked than nfw .",
    "model 8 may provide the most self - consistent overall fit to the mass constraints for ngc 4472 ; if so , the old stars in ngc 4472 have a mass to light ratio @xmath185 , about @xmath189 percent lower than the mass to light ratio determined from stellar dynamics .    in summary ,",
    "none of our models is fully satisfactory in every respect . the total mass to light ratio ( including dropout mass ) in @xmath144 is 10 - 35 percent higher than the value for the underlying galaxy .",
    "however , in model 8 in which @xmath186 for the old stars , the difference between the x - ray mass determined from the models and ngc 4472 is appreciably reduced .",
    "nevertheless , the central apparent gas density and x - ray surface brightness in model 8 are still larger than observed , requiring additional non - thermal support .",
    "there is no independent theoretical justification for the dropout profile @xmath76 assumed in models 6 and 8 ; as explained earlier , the dropout distribution depends on unknown interstellar entropy fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , for all models considered here the mass of cooled interstellar gas contributes significantly to the total mass and the dynamically determined mass to light ratio within the inner galaxy .",
    "in this series of calculations we have taken a census of all baryons involved in the evolution of a large elliptical galaxy : the original stellar component , the interstellar medium , and  of most interest  the small but troublesome mass of hot gas that cools over cosmic time .",
    "we have shown that the radial distribution of cooled interstellar gas influences dynamical and x - ray determinations of the total interior mass and the radial profiles of apparent density , temperature and x - ray brightness of the hot gas . in our models ,",
    "cooled gas is slowly deposited in the central galaxy @xmath56 ( see figure 3 ) as indicated by the extent of observed h@xmath18 emission . since there is little or no direct observational evidence for the mass that has dropped out in ellipticals like ngc 4472 , the cooled mass must either be dark at optical and radio frequencies or indistinguishable from the old stars .",
    "low mass stars are an obvious and physically reasonable endstate for the cooled gas ( ferland , fabian & johnstone 1994 ; mathews & brighenti 1999 ) . we also suppose that the cooled gas remains at the dropout site where it contributes to the galactic potential .      in an attempt to reduce the influence of cooling and cooled gas on the models , we have altered many of the model parameters .",
    "the chosen cosmology ( @xmath71 ; @xmath190 and @xmath191 , etc . ) or the baryon fraction @xmath192 have little influence on the total dropout mass . changing the times when the stars and the galactic potential form ( @xmath84 and @xmath193 ) or the spatial scale of the release of snii energy within reasonable limits have only a modest influence on the dropout mass that accumulates by time @xmath75 gyrs . increasing the interval @xmath194 between star and galaxy formation",
    "does reduce the total dropout mass , but this interval can not be too large since luminous ellipticals are observed at large redshifts . the cooling dropout would not be dramatically reduced if massive ellipticals were all only a few gyrs old since most of the stellar mass loss occurs just after star formation ; however , many or most luminous ellipticals are thought to be very old .    perhaps the most effective way to preserve the excellent agreement between @xmath181 and @xmath167 in figure 1 in @xmath195 , without constraining the mass dropout profile @xmath76 , would be to reduce the total mass that has cooled over cosmic time .",
    "the most sensitive parameter influencing the cooled mass is the specific rate of stellar mass loss , @xmath187 .",
    "although the total mass of hot gas increases with time due to the continued influx of secondary infalling gas , the mass of hot gas within the optical galaxy originates mostly from stellar mass loss and the x - ray luminosity there scales as @xmath196 ( appendix b of tsai & mathews 1995 ) . computed models similar to those described here but with arbitrarily reduced @xmath187 fit the @xmath40 and @xmath108 data rather well at time @xmath77 and produce much less cooling dropout",
    "however , @xmath187 can not be lowered without also increasing the stellar mass .",
    "for all reasonable power law initial mass functions , @xmath187 varies inversely with the stellar mass to light ratio : @xmath197 { 1 \\over ( m_*/l_b ) } \\propto { 1 \\over ( m_*/l_b)}.\\ ] ] the physical explanation for the constancy of @xmath198 is that both @xmath8 ( dominated by post - main sequence stars ) and @xmath199 depend on the instantaneous rate that stars leave the main sequence so this imf - dependent factor cancels out ( e.g. renzini & buzzoni 1986 ) . to illustrate this result",
    ", we use the renzini - buzzoni procedure and plot in figure 6 the relationship between @xmath200 and @xmath35 at time @xmath75 gyrs for 84 power law imfs with slopes @xmath2010.6 , 0.8 , 1.0 , 1.2 , 1.4 , 1.6 , and 1.8 , each with lower and upper mass limits of @xmath2020.01 , 0.032 , 0.1 , 0.32 and @xmath20310 , 32 , 100 .",
    "the remarkable linearity in figure 6 shows that the quantity in square brackets in the equation above is almost invariant to large changes in the slope or mass limits for power law imfs .",
    "therefore , if @xmath187 is reduced by 2 or 3 in an attempt to reduce the total dropout mass , the stellar mass ( and @xmath35 ) must be increased by the same factor ; as a result the total mass ejected , @xmath204 , and the total dropout mass do not change .",
    "although massive ellipticals are not rotationally flattened , they do rotate significantly , e.g. @xmath205 for ngc 4472 ( faber et al .",
    "if the hot interstellar gas rotates in the same sense as the bulk of mass - losing stars , stars formed from the cooled gas should form into a disk of scale @xmath206 ( brighenti & mathews 1997b ) , although the development of such disks is likely to be suppressed by the mass dropout process . nevertheless , to the extent that the cooled gas has a disk - like distribution , its global influence on the stellar dynamics in @xmath52 would be less than if the same dark mass were distributed spherically .",
    "remarkably , there is no observational evidence at present for rotational flattening in the x - ray images of giant ellipticals like ngc 4472 .",
    "dynamical determinations of the mass to light ratio from stellar velocities reflect the entire mass within the stellar orbits , including non - baryonic mass .",
    "the nfw halo we use in our models for ngc 4472 agrees with x - ray observations in the extended halo but is slightly too massive near @xmath207 relative to the x - ray mass @xmath20 observationally determined for ngc 4472 .",
    "this may indicate that dark halos are less centrally peaked than nfw ( see kravtsov et al .",
    "the mass of our nfw halo model contributes about 10 percent to the dynamical mass to light ratio measured within @xmath142 , but the nfw profile is probably disturbed in this region .",
    "when the dominant baryonic mass in @xmath56 compressed to form the de vaucouleurs profile , we expect that the nfw halo was dragged inward and distorted .",
    "however , the dark halo cores of the earlier galactic condensations that merged to form the elliptical may have expanded due to starburst driven galactic winds . because of these various counteracting effects , the small non - baryonic contribution to dynamical mass to light determinations is uncertain .      for all models studied here  based on a wide variety of mass dropout profiles @xmath76",
    " the mass of cooled interstellar gas contributes substantially to the total mass within @xmath147 where the stellar mass to light ratio is determined from stellar velocities . if optically dark low mass stars form from the cooled gas , the `` stellar '' mass to light ratios in the literature refer to two distinct stellar populations having radically different initial mass functions and spatial distributions . the stellar mass to light ratio of the original ,",
    "optically luminous stellar population is lower than published values indicate .",
    "a complete solution of this problem requires a better understanding of the physics of star formation and the processes that control the stellar imf .",
    "we have assumed here that a salpeter imf provides a satisfactory approximation to the original single - burst star formation at early times .",
    "yet we argue that the younger dropout imf is strongly skewed toward low mass stars .",
    "the imf has evolved over time .",
    "it is possible therefore that the early , more intense mass dropout resulted in a more nearly salpeter - like imf , producing a fraction of currently observed luminous stars in ellipticals .",
    "if so , this early dropout would not contribute to the excess dropout mass that we find in our models , but would have already been included in the original de vaucouleurs population .",
    "high density , metal enriched stellar cores in elliptical galaxies may have derived from normal - imf star formation from early , more intense interstellar cooling .",
    "this is similar to assumptions made for dissipative galactic core formation from the convergence of gas following major mergers ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "while such notions can not be entirely dismissed , the approximate universality of the de vaucouleurs light profile among ellipticals may argue against a dual formation process for the radial distribution of luminous stars : violent relaxation and cooling flow dropout .    throughout this discussion",
    "we have assumed that the stellar population formed from cooling flow dropout is optically dark .",
    "although there is little or no evidence that normal massive ob stars ( or snii ) are present in elliptical galaxies , it is possible that younger stars having masses up to @xmath26 @xmath6 are present and that such intermediate mass stars could form from the cooled gas ( mathews & brighenti 1999 ) .",
    "this type of dropout stellar population could contribute to the total optical light .",
    "if the mass to light ratio of dropout and old stellar populations are similar , the dropout component could be difficult to detect by the means we have discussed here and its perturbation on the observed @xmath35 would be greatly lessened . in this case",
    "the dropout population would introduce an additional radial light profile that would differ slightly from that of the old stellar population .",
    "the dropout mass profiles in figure 3 indicate that models 4 and 6 would be rather difficult to detect against the background stellar light .",
    "intermediate mass dropout stars could therefore provide a satisfactory resolution to the problems we have discussed here .",
    "the ensemble of elliptical galaxies is known to have global parameters that deviate slightly from the assumptions of virial equilibrium and homologous structure .",
    "the deviation of this fundamental plane relationship is in the sense that the dynamical mass to light ratio increases with galactic mass , @xmath208 ( dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) . such a non - homologous deviation could in principle be produced by the small amount of cooled interstellar gas @xmath23 provided it increases appropriately with @xmath168 .",
    "to test this idea , we performed an identical hydrodynamic calculation for an elliptical galaxy having a mass one fourth that of ngc 4472 .",
    "the dark halo mass was also reduced by the same factor but the cosmological environment and mass dropout distribution were identical to those used for ngc 4472 , scaled to a smaller @xmath3 .",
    "we found that the amount of mass dropout @xmath23 is _ higher _ in smaller ellipticals relative to the total baryonic mass @xmath168 .",
    "this is opposite to the trend observed in the fundamental plane .",
    "however , if hot gas and dark matter in the outer halos of smaller ellipticals is tidally stripped in group environments , as suggested by mathews & brighenti ( 1998b ) , then the mass of cooled gas would be reduced and its effect on the fundamental plane would be reduced .",
    "nevertheless , explanations of the deviations of the fundamental plane from virial scaling must recognize the possible additional influence of dropout mass , regardless of the trend of @xmath209 with @xmath168 .",
    "\\(1 ) if the hot interstellar gas cools only in the very center of ngc 4472 for @xmath210 gyrs , the total accumulated mass there would be @xmath211 times larger than the mass of the central black hole observed .",
    "if such large concentrated masses were generally present in bright ellipticals , interstellar gas in @xmath166 would be compressed and heated to temperatures @xmath212 kev .",
    "such hot thermal cores are not generally observed .",
    "we conclude that the cooling dropout in massive ellipticals must occur before the gas reaches the galactic center .",
    "the hypotheses of distributed mass dropout and low mass star formation were proposed many years ago ( fabian , nulsen & canizares 1982 ; thomas 1986 ; cowie & binney 1988 ; vedder , trester , & canizares 1988 ; sarazin & ashe 1989 ; ferland , fabian , & johnstone 1994 ) . however , these historical arguments were generally based on the notion that mass dropout would help reduce computed x - ray surface brightness profiles at small projected radii , as required by the observations , but we have shown here that in some cases enhanced dropout at small galactic radii can cause @xmath109 to increase , not decrease .",
    "( the total bolometric x - ray luminosity @xmath7 should always be lower in distributed cooling models since the hot gas experiences only a fraction of the galactic potential . )",

    "<S> typically @xmath0 percent of the total baryonic mass in luminous elliptical galaxies is in the form of cooled interstellar gas . although the mass contributed by cooled gas is small relative to the mass of the old stellar system in these galaxies , it is almost certainly concentrated within the optical effective radius where it can influence the local dynamical mass . </S>",
    "<S> however , the mass of cooled gas can not be confined to very small galactic radii ( @xmath1 ) since its mass would greatly exceed that of known central mass concentrations in giant ellipticals , normally attributed to massive black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the proposition that a population of very low mass , optically dark stars is created from the cooled gas . for a wide variety of assumed radial distributions for the interstellar cooling </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the mass of cooled gas contributes significantly ( @xmath230 percent ) to stellar dynamical mass to light ratios which , as a result , are expected to vary with galactic radius . however , </S>",
    "<S> if the stars formed from cooled interstellar gas are optically luminous , their pertubation on the the mass to light ratio of the old stellar population may be reduced . </S>",
    "<S> cooling mass dropout also perturbs the local apparent x - ray surface brightness distribution , often in a positive sense for centrally concentrated cooling . in general </S>",
    "<S> the computed x - ray surface brightness exceeds observed values within @xmath3 , suggesting the presence of additional support by magnetic stresses or non - thermal pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of cooled gas inside @xmath3 is sensitive to rate that old stars lose mass @xmath4 , but this rate is nearly independent of the initial mass function of the old stellar population .    </S>",
