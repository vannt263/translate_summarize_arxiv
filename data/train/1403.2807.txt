    "we have introduced methods of some generality for the construction of compressed sensing matrices . in the interests of clarity and brevity ,",
    "we have sketched only the basic ideas . in this section",
    "we give a number of extensions .",
    "let @xmath312 be a set of orthonormal bases of @xmath313 ( written as matrices with the basis vectors as columns ) .",

    "we show that a set of mubs can be used to increase the number of columns in the matrices given in construction [ con0 ] without any loss in @xmath66-recoverability .",
    "suppose that @xmath71 is a @xmath141 in which all points have replication number @xmath93 , and let @xmath320 be a set of mubs of dimension @xmath93",
    ". denote by @xmath321 the frame constructed from construction [ con0 ] using @xmath319 throughout .",
    "we claim that the frame @xmath322 $ ] is @xmath82-equiangular . to see this",
    ", it suffices to consider the inner product of a column from @xmath321 with a column from @xmath323 . in the case",
    "that the columns are labelled by distinct points , the columns share a single non - zero entry , so the inner product is of absolute magnitude at most @xmath324 . in the case",
    "that the columns are labelled by the same point from @xmath41 , we have that the inner product is @xmath324 , by the definition of the mubs .",
    "thus we obtain a frame with the same number of rows as in a naive application of construction [ con0 ] , but with @xmath325 times as many columns .",
    "this construction is particularly effective when @xmath93 is a prime power , as in this case a full set of @xmath326 @xmath327s exists @xcite . if @xmath71 is a @xmath328 ( that is , a @xmath77 with @xmath329 ) , then @xmath330 , and every point has replication number @xmath331 . a direct application of construction [ con0 ] yields a @xmath332 compressed sensing matrix .",
    "under the assumption that @xmath333 is a prime power and using a set of mubs , we obtain a @xmath334 matrix .",
    "while in the first case we obtain a ratio @xmath335 between rows and columns , in the second we obtain a ratio @xmath336 , which is a substantial improvement .    of course , the restriction that all replication numbers are equal is merely a convenience .",
    "we are free to replace each hadamard matrix in construction [ con0 ] with a set of mutually unbiased hadamard matrices .",
    "little is known about the existence of mubs when the dimension is not of prime power order , so the practical applications of this observation in the general case may be limited .",
    "if @xmath41 is a set of @xmath41 points and @xmath69 is a collection of subsets of @xmath41 , then @xmath337 is a _ packing _ if each pair of points occurs together in at most one block of @xmath69 .",
    "if each block in @xmath69 has cardinality in @xmath72 , then we denote such a packing by @xmath338 .",
    "( if every pair of points is contained in exactly one block we recover the definition of a @xmath141 . )",
    "it is easily verified that construction [ con0 ] produces @xmath5-equiangular frames when a packing is used in place of a pairwise balanced design , provided that there are no points with replication numbers that are too small .",
    "if there exists a @xmath77 with @xmath108 and @xmath109 in which the smallest replication number is at least @xmath339 , then there exists a compressed sensing matrix with @xmath22-recoverability for all @xmath340 .",
    "if the average block size is @xmath244 , then the ratio of rows to columns is @xmath341 .",
    "we observe that the existence of dense packings is guaranteed by the rdl ` nibble ' ( see section 4.7 of @xcite , for example ) .",
    "whilst results depending on theorem [ caroyuster ] are asymptotic in nature , one can apply the rdl nibble to obtain a packing of any complete graph with graphs from @xmath147 . as @xmath342",
    ", this packing will tend to an @xmath147-decomposition .",
    "thus we can in principal construct compressed sensing matrices of any size using this method , though they will approach welch - optimality only as @xmath343 .",
    "[ con1 ] if @xmath71 is a @xmath77 , then let @xmath78 and @xmath344 and define @xmath13 to be the @xmath12 frame constructed as follows .",

    "* for each @xmath85 , column @xmath15 of @xmath80 determines @xmath345 columns of @xmath13 : each zero in column @xmath15 is replaced with the @xmath346 row vector @xmath89 , and each @xmath82 in column @xmath15 is replaced with a distinct non - initial row of @xmath347 .",
    "results analogous to those shown for construction [ con0 ] hold also for construction [ con1 ] .",
    "the main interest of construction [ con1 ] is as a source of @xmath5-equiangular frames for @xmath68 .",
    "[ mainthm1 ] if @xmath71 is a @xmath77 , then construction [ con1 ] produces an @xmath348-equiangular frame .    using the techniques developed in proposition [ mainthm0 ]",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath349 we note in particular that the ratio between the upper and lower bounds is @xmath350 .",
    "it is almost immediate from the statement of the welch bound that @xmath351 .",
    "we now produce a sharper lower bound for @xmath50 than that given in proposition [ mainthm0 ] .",
    "observe that @xmath50 is an increasing function in @xmath11 and @xmath352 .",
    "recall also that @xmath353 . then @xmath354    using the ratio between the upper and lower bounds on inner products described above and the fact that @xmath50 lies between the bounds , we obtain the following : @xmath355    finally , as in the definition of equiangularity , we solve for @xmath5 , finding it to be the greater of @xmath356 and @xmath357 , completing the proof .",
    "we note that in the special case that @xmath329 , we achieve a @xmath84-equiangular frame .",
    "lemma [ normlemma ] implies that such a frame is tight , and so we obtain an etf .",
    "this is the main result of fickus et al .",
    ", see theorem 1 of @xcite .",
    "in proposition [ integercase ] we showed that in the @xmath358 plane , if we choose any ray through the origin ( with integer slope @xmath244 ) , there exists a constant @xmath211 such that all points of the form @xmath359 at distance at least @xmath211 from the origin correspond to compressed sensing matrices meeting the square - root bottleneck .",
    "we generalised this in theorem [ mainexistence ] to rational slopes , and showed that points close to the ray of form @xmath360 corresponded to compressed sensing matrices .",
    "we give another result in this section which shows that small perturbations to the underlying @xmath141 can be used to obtain @xmath361 compressed sensing matrices close to the square - root bottleneck .",

    "first note the elementary identity @xmath365 which tells us that @xmath366 blocks of size @xmath244 cover the same number of pairs of points as @xmath244 blocks of size @xmath310 and @xmath310 blocks of size @xmath311 . but observe that the sum of the block sizes on the left is @xmath367 , whereas the sum of the block sizes on the right is @xmath368 .",
    "that is , we can reduce the number of columns by @xmath82 by swapping @xmath366 blocks of size @xmath244 for @xmath244 blocks of size @xmath310 and @xmath310 blocks of size @xmath311 .",
