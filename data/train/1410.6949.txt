    "in this paper we study the generic assouad dimension for a variety of different models for generating random fractal sets .",
    "the first model is that of _ random iterated function systems_. this well - studied random construction is based on randomising the classical iterated function system in a natural way .",
    "since this model will be used in several instances throughout the paper we will describe it in detail in section [ randomintro ] .",
    "firstly , we seek to study the almost sure assouad dimension of attractors generated in this way , and to do so we specialise to the self - similar setting , in section [ sssection ] , and the setting of self - affine carpets , in section [ bmsection ] .",
    "in particular , these two sections seek the generic dimension from a measure theoretic point of view .",
    "secondly , in section [ typsection ] we consider the same model but seek the generic dimension from a topological point of view , i.e. for a residual subset of the sample space .",
    "this approach was initiated by the first author in @xcite and , as in that paper , we are able to compute the generic dimension in a much more general setting than the measure theoretic approach permits .",
    "our second model is _ fractal percolation _",
    ", often referred to as _ mandelbrot percolation _ , which is also a famous and well - studied model for randomness .",
    "our results on fractal percolation will be given in the self - contained section [ percsect ] .",
    "in particular , conditioned on non - extinction , we compute the almost sure assouad dimension of fractal percolation as well as the almost sure assouad dimension of all orthogonal projections of the percolation simultaneously .",
    "a somewhat surprising corollary of our results is that , conditioned on non - extinction , almost surely the fractal percolation can not be embedded in any lower dimensional euclidean space , no matter how small the almost sure hausdorff dimension is .",
    "all proofs will be given in section [ proofs ] .",
    "finally , in section [ questionsection ] we discuss our results and pose some questions of particular interest to us .",
    "+   + the key common theme throughout the paper and across the somewhat disparate array of questions is that the assouad dimension is always generically as large as possible . in the measure theoretic setting this behaviour is completely different from that observed by other important notions of dimension , such as hausdorff , packing or box counting , where these dimensions are generically an intermediate value , which can take the form of an appropriately weighted average of deterministic values . in order to put our results into context , our results will be compared throughout the paper to those showing some kind of ` averaging ' . in the topological",
    "setting , the generic dimensions of random fractals were shown to be ` extremal ' in @xcite : some are generically as small as possible and others are generically as large as possible .",
    "the interesting thing for us is that for the assouad dimension of random attractors the measure theoretic and topological answers agree .",
    "this is also in stark contrast with what is ` usually ' the case .",
    "a classical example being that lebesgue almost all real numbers are normal , but a residual set of real numbers are as far away from being normal as possible @xcite .",
    "the assouad dimension is the main object of study in this paper and will be defined and discussed in this section .",
    "it was introduced by the french mathematician patrice assouad during his phd research at universit paris xi , orsay in the 1970s @xcite .",
    "assouad s original motivation was to study embedding problems , a subject where the assouad dimension is still playing a fundamental rle , see @xcite .",
    "the concept has also found a home in other areas of mathematics , including the theory of quasi - conformal mappings @xcite , and more recently it is gaining substantial attention in the literature on fractal geometry @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that , due to its intimate relationship with tangents , it has always been present , although behind the scenes , in the pioneering work of furstenberg on micro - sets and the related ergodic theory which goes back to the 1960s , see @xcite .",
    "the assouad dimension also plays a rle in the fractional hardy inequality .",
    "if the boundary of a domain in @xmath3 has assouad dimension less than or equal to @xmath4 , then the domain admits the fractional @xmath5-hardy inequality  @xcite .",
    "the assouad dimension gives a coarse and heavily localised description of how ` thick ' a given metric space is on small scales ; hence its importance for embedding problems .",
    "most of the other popular notions of dimension , like the hausdorff , packing , or box dimension , give much more global information , taking an ` average thickness ' over the whole set .",
    "as such , exploring and understanding the relationships , similarities , and differences , between the assouad dimension and the other global dimensions is of high and increasing interest , and is one of the key themes of this paper .",
    "+   + let @xmath6 be a metric space and for any non - empty subset @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and let @xmath9 be the smallest number of sets with diameter less than or equal to @xmath10 required to cover @xmath11 .",
    "the _ assouad dimension _ of a non - empty subset @xmath11 of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , is defined by @xmath14 it is worth remarking that some authors do not include the @xmath15 in the above definition , i.e. they allow @xmath10 and @xmath16 to be arbitrarily large .",
    "the reason for this is to guarantee invariance of the assouad dimension under specific types of maps , for example the involution @xmath17 @xmath18 , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem a.10 ( 1 ) ) .",
    "this clearly gives rise to a larger quantity , but for bounded sets @xmath11 the two notions are equivalent and in this paper , as with most papers on fractal geometry , we only consider bounded sets .",
    "we also note that the assouad dimension can be defined in a number of slightly different ways , but all leading to the same concept .",
    "for example , the function @xmath19 can be replaced by the maximum size of an @xmath10-packing of the set @xmath11 , or the minimum number of closed cubes of side length @xmath10 required to cover @xmath11 .",

    "our results in sections [ sssection ] , [ bmsection ] and [ typsection ] use the random iterated function systems model , which we recall and discuss in this section .",
    "this model has been used extensively in the literature and fits in to the more general framework of @xmath20-variable fractals introduced and discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath21 be a compact metric space .",
    "a ( deterministic ) iterated function system ( ifs ) is a finite non - empty set of contraction mappings on @xmath12 .",
    "given such an ifs , @xmath22 , it is well - known that there exists a unique non - empty compact set @xmath11 satisfying @xmath23 which is called the attractor of the ifs , see  @xcite .",
    "we define a random iterated function system ( rifs ) to be a set @xmath24 , where each @xmath25 is a deterministic ifs , @xmath26 , for a finite index set , @xmath27 , and each map , @xmath28 , is a contracting self - map on @xmath12 . we define a continuum of attractors of @xmath29 in the following way .",

    "the attractor of @xmath29 corresponding to @xmath33 is defined to be @xmath34 so , by ` randomly choosing ' @xmath35 , we ` randomly choose ' an attractor @xmath36 .",
    "we now wish to make statements about the generic nature of @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , our key question is : `` what is the assouad dimension of @xmath36 for generic @xmath35 ? '' we note that in this paper we adopt two different definitions of ` generic ' .",
    "firstly , we may mean _ almost surely with respect to a natural probability measure on _ @xmath37 or , secondly , we may mean _ for a residual subset of _ @xmath37 . in sections [ sssection ] and [ bmsection ]",

    "the second , topological approach , will be discussed in section [ typsection ] , the only section where it will be used .",
    "section [ percsect ] will concern mandelbrot percolation so here ` generic ' will again refer to _ almost surely with respect to a natural probability measure _ , although the measure in that section is different to the one described here .",
    "+   + we may refer to elements in @xmath37 as _ realisations _ and , in general , for symbolic codings refer to finite or infinite sequences as words . for an alphabet @xmath38 , we write @xmath39 and @xmath40 to denote all infinite and finite sequences with entries in @xmath38 , respectively . given two ( finite or infinite ) words @xmath41 we write @xmath42 for the maximum number of common initial entries : @xmath43 , where we assume for convenience that @xmath44 .",
    "we write @xmath45 to denote the finite word @xmath46 of length @xmath47 such that @xmath48 .",
    "we also write @xmath49 to denote the one - sided left shift on @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "we define a metric on our space @xmath37 by @xmath51 for @xmath52 with @xmath53 and use this metric to define the topology on @xmath37 .",

    "* chapter 3 ) .",
    "it was unknown until recently whether or not the assouad dimension also always coincides with the other dimensions , but it was proved in  @xcite that this was not true by providing an explicit counter example and then a general theory was developed in  @xcite . the key properties which decide if the assouad and hausdorff dimensions coincide are various separation conditions which control how the different pieces of the self - similar set overlap with each other .",
    "we recall these now , as they are relevant for this study .",
    "open set condition _ ( osc ) was introduced by moran in  @xcite and has played a fundamental rle in the theory of self - similar sets ever since .",

    "* chapter 9 ) and  @xcite .",

    "the opposite inequality is trivial and since @xmath550 occurs almost surely conditioned on non - extinction , the result follows .",
    "it will be clear to the diligent reader that our methods could be used with only minor alterations to prove more general results than the ones we chose to state .",
    "this was a conscious choice made in order to clearly display what we believe are the key new phenomena we were able to observe .",
    "in particular , in the random self - similar setting , a simple modification of the ` good sets ' would yield that for the almost sure lower bound , the maximum over deterministic ifss can be replaced with the supremum over periodic words .",
    "this only effects things when there are overlaps as theorem [ theo2 - 1 ] shows that the two values are the same if the uosc is assumed .    assuming no separation conditions , is the almost sure assouad dimension of a 1-variable random self - similar attractor given by the supremum of the assouad dimensions of attractors corresponding to eventually periodic words ?    for the example in section [ counterexample ]",
    "we readily obtain that the almost sure assouad dimension is 1 .",
    "moreover , in the self - affine setting , our methods should enable the analogous results to be proved for random lalley - gatzouras carpets or random baraski carpets .",
    "in these cases the upper bounds would be considerably more technical , but by combining our methods with the techniques in @xcite the expected results should follow .",
    "+   + our methods for proving theorem  [ percolationassouad ] easily extend to encompass more general percolation models , for example the model considered by falconer and jin  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) .",
    "this model is based on an ifs of similarities @xmath553 satisfying the osc and a probability vector @xmath554 associated with the power set of @xmath553 where we assume each entry is non - zero .",
    "each sub - ifs describes a different way to iterate the construction starting from any cylinder and for every surviving @xmath47th level cylinder , which ifs to apply is chosen randomly and independently with respect to this probability vector , giving rise to a random subset of the initial attractor .",
    "similar to theorem  [ percolationassouad ] we can show that if the probabilities are chosen such that there is a positive probability of non - extinction then , conditioned on this happening , the assouad dimension is almost surely maximal , i.e it equals the assouad dimension of the attractor of @xmath553 .",
    "+   + this paper has unearthed the following general principle : _ for a randomly generated set , the assouad dimension is generically as big as possible_. we wonder to what other random settings this principle applies .",
    "some of the most famous examples of random fractals are certain sets associated to random functions or random processes .",
    "for example , the graph , range , and level sets of ( fractional ) brownian motion are random fractals with interesting dimension theoretic properties .",
    "the almost sure hausdorff dimensions of these objects are long known and are , in some sense , intermediate values .",
    "what are the almost sure assouad dimensions of the graph , range and level sets for ( fractional ) brownian motion on @xmath143 $ ] ?    a natural direction to try to push theorems [ ssresult ] and [ lowerboundcarpets ] would be to consider more general rifss , either by allowing more general classes of map or less control on the overlaps , or a more general random model , for example @xmath20-variable .",
    "one particular instance of this could be to consider more general self - affine carpets , like those considered in @xcite .",
    "the assouad dimension of bedford - mcmullen carpets and the extensions considered by lalley - gatzouras @xcite and @xcite were computed in @xcite , but extending the calculations to the carpets considered by feng - wang @xcite or the first author @xcite is currently out of reach due to the lack of a suitable grid like structure .",
    "+   + another possible way of randomising the ifs construction is to consider one particular deterministic ifs and then randomise some of the defining parameters .",
    "there are many ways of doing this , but perhaps the most well known is the approach pioneered by falconer in @xcite . here a fixed collection of linear contractions on @xmath223 are turned into a nontrivial ifs by randomly choosing a set of corresponding translation vectors .",
    "the main result of @xcite is a formula for the hausdorff dimension which holds for almost all translations ( assuming a mild technical condition on the norms of the matrices ) .",
    "it was already asked by the first author what the generic assouad dimension of a self - affine set in this setting is  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* question 4.3 ) .",
    "we raise it again because , if the general principle in this paper applies here , then the answer would be that the assouad dimension is almost surely maximal , i.e. the same as the ambient spatial dimension , however , this can not be the case .",
    "for example , work in @xmath555 and take an ifs with two ( or more ) similarity maps with very small contraction ratios .",
    "then there will be a positive measure set of translations where the resulting self - similar set satisfies the osc and thus has hausdorff and assouad dimension equal and strictly less than 1 .",
    "+   + it is of particular interest that theorems [ ssresult ] and [ lowerboundcarpets ] do not depend on which specific bernoulli measure we chose .",
    "in particular , as long as the defining probability vector is strictly positive , then the assouad dimension is almost surely maximal no matter what .",
    "this is perhaps surprising since for all other notions of dimension the almost sure value depends crucially on the exact measure used .",
    "this leads to the following natural question .",
    "for which ( borel probability ) measures @xmath57 on @xmath37 do theorems [ ssresult ] and [ lowerboundcarpets ] remain true ?",
    "we feel it is likely that this will hold for much more general measures than bernoulli measures .",
    "the argument should go through with only minor modifications for gibbs measures for hlder potentials , for example , but we expect a much more general statement is true .",
    "+   + concerning fractal percolation , we wonder about various types of intersection problems .",
    "for example , it is currently a topic of interest to study slices , that is intersections with translations of lower dimensional subspaces , see @xcite .",
