    "in a multiuser multi - relay network , the users desire to transfer their messages to a common destination or to different destinations with the help of relays in an efficient and reliable way . to date , most proposed relaying schemes such as amplify - and - forward ( af ) and decode - and - forward ( df ) perform quite well in the absence of multiuser interference [ 1 - 2 ] , where the users transmit in orthogonal channels ( for instance , by using time division multiple access ( tdma ) ) at the cost of low network throughput . on the other hand ,",
    "if the users transmit simultaneously , the performance will be degraded due to the multiuser interference or noise amplification . by utilizing network coding along with df or af relaying scheme ,",
    "a combination of the users messages can be constructed in each relay to improve the system throughput [ 3 - 4 ] .",
    "the novel relaying technique , known as compute - and - forward ( cmf ) [ 5 ] , has been designed for multiuser applications with the aim of increasing the network throughput . in this scheme ,",
    "based on a noisy received combination of simultaneously transmitted signals of the users , each relay attempts to recover a linear integer - combination of the users messages ( an equation ) , instead of recovering each individual message separately . to enable the relay to recover the equation ,",
    "the cmf scheme is usually implemented based on using proper lattice codes [ 6 ] .",
    "an attractive characteristic of cmf scheme is that the channel state information ( csi ) is not needed in the transmitters , which makes it practical for most applications .",
    "the recovered equations by the relays are then forwarded to the common destination that attempts to solve and recover the users messages .",
    "in fact , the cmf method exploits rather than combats the interference , towards a better network performance .",
    "cmf method has been considered and studied in multi antenna systems [ 7 ] , two way relaying systems [ 8 - 9 ] , cooperative distributed antenna systems [ 10 ] , multi - access relay channels [ 11 ] , generalized multi - way relay channels [ 12 ] , and two transmitter multi - relay systems [ 13 ] . however , among the most important challenges of the cmf is the rank failure problem which has not been solved yet . since",
    "each relay selects its equation coefficients independently to maximize its own rate , the equations that are received from different relays at the destinations can be linearly dependent . in other words ,",
    "the coefficient matrix of the equations received by the destinations can encounter rank failure . in this case , the destination can not recover the users messages and the system performance deteriorates considerably [ 13 ] . in the method proposed in [ 14 ] , each relay recovers its best @xmath0 equations with the highest rates and then sends them to the destination , each equation in a time slot .",
    "these equations are not necessarily independent . among the equations received from the relays ,",
    "the destination selects @xmath1 ( @xmath1 is the number of transmitted messages ) independent equations , if any , with highest rate in order to recover the messages .",
    "however , this method can also encounter rank failure , although its probability reduces with the increase of @xmath2 at the cost of very high required time slots from relays to destination .",
    "the rank failure problem is mostly considered when there exists a central coordinator with a global csi that computes independent equations with a maximum computation rate ( the equation detecting rate ) , then allocates the equations to the relays [ 10 ] . on the other hand , most af- and df - based strategies , which do not encounter the rank failure problem , have only a simple timer implemented in each relay to coordinate different relays [ 15 - 16 ] .    in this paper , we propose novel distributed strategies to handle the rank failure problem for a general multi - user multi - relay wireless network at the absence of a central coordinator . as demonstrated , the proposed schemes are based on simple timer on each relay and can compete with the conventional af and df schemes practically .",
    "our contributions are as follows ;    \\1 .",
    "we propose a relaying strategy based on cmf , named `` incremental compute - and - forward '' ( icmf ) , in which the linearly independent equations are recovered one by one through cooperation among the relays using a simple timer in each relay .",
    "for the first time , we propose a general distributed successive method for recovering different number of equations .",
    "we provide an algorithm ( algorithm 1 ) that can be implemented in multi - relay scenarios with low complexity .",
    "we present a receiver structure for our scheme , and propose limited search area for its integer optimization problem ( lemma 1 ) .    here , though we use the same concept as in [ 17 ] for creating effective channels in our scheme , the successive cmf presented in [ 17 ] is a one - stage successive equation computator implemented in one relay .",
    "in fact , this scheme is proposed for recovering an equation with the help of another decoded equation at a rate higher than the cmf .",
    "we prove that despite of its much less complexity , the icmf with sufficiently strong inter - relays channels outperforms the achievable rate of the optimal centralized cmf scheme with global knowledge ( theorem 2 ) .",
    "we introduce `` amplify - forward - and - compute '' ( afc ) , based on using the conventional amplify - and - forward relaying method and the integer - forcing linear receiver ( iflr ) introduced by zhan , et al [ 7 ] . in afc , each relay simply amplifies its received combination of the users noisy signals and forwards the result to the destination .",
    "then , the destination recovers all the required equations .",
    "hence , the relay structure in this scheme is considerably simpler than those in cmf and icmf . in afc method ,",
    "the destination acts as a computation center , while in the cmf and the icmf , the computation ( recovering the equations ) is performed by the relays in a distributed manner . here",
    ", we borrow the reciever structure for iflr from [ 7 ] , with slight modification to be matched with the amplified received signals .",
    "we also introduce limited search area for its integer optimization problem .",
    "we introduce `` hybrid compute - amplify and forward '' ( hcaf ) scheme , based on the combination of icmf and afc schemes . in this strategy , first the linearly independent equations are successively recovered by the relays based on the icmf scheme till the stage at which the maximum computation rate derived by the relay is less than the target rate .",
    "then for the rest of the equations , the afc technique is used and the related equations are recovered by the destination .",
    "the destination exploits the equations transmitted from the computing relays to recover the rest of equations with higher rate .",
    "a new receiver structure and limited search area for the integer optimization problem of the hcaf scheme are presented as well .",
    "we evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes , in terms of outage probability , and compare the results with the cmf and the df relaying schemes .",
    "our numerical results show that the icmf and afc strategies outperform the cmf method significantly and provide higher diversity orders .",
    "the proposed icmf slightly outperforms the centralized optimal cmf with global knowledge at strong inter - relays channels , while holds an acceptable performance degradation compared with the optimal cmf at very poor inter - relays channels .",
    "although the afc strategy performs worse than the icmf , especially when the links between the relays are strong , it has much less complexity .",
    "hcaf improves the performance of the icmf at the cost of more complex receiver structure at the destination .",
    "our proposed schemes lead to substantially less outage probability compared to the conventional df scheme .",
    "moreover , the performance gain of the proposed schemes increases with the number of users and relays .",
    "the reminder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system model and the conventional cmf strategy are described .",
    "the proposed methods , namely icmf , afc , and hcaf , are presented in section iii , section iv , and section v , respectively .",

    "hence , the overall rate for recovering equation @xmath45 at the destination is determined by , @xmath64    the destination receives @xmath15 equations from the relays . to recover the users messages ,",
    "the destination should select @xmath1 equations from these @xmath15 equations .",

    "in this method , @xmath1 independent equations with the highest computation rates are recovered and sent to the destination through the cooperation among the relays in a distributed manner .",

    "hence , the rate of this strategy can be written as @xmath201 note that , the same as in the icmf , the hcaf needs @xmath136 time slots to transmit @xmath1 messages . to maximize the computation rate ( 67 ) , from ( 65 )",

    "the remaining equations , i.e. the rows of @xmath208 , are recovered by quantizing @xmath178 as @xmath209 where , @xmath175 finally , by solving the @xmath1 independent equations , obtained from the @xmath77 computing relays and the @xmath158 amplifying relays , the destination can recover all of the users messages .",
    "in this section , we evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed methods through computer simulations .",
    "we assume the case in which all of the nodes , i.e. , the users and the relays , have equal transmission powers , and @xmath210 , @xmath211 , and @xmath212 .",
    "however , the same qualitative conclusions as in the presented figures hold for the heterogenous setups as well .",
    "threshold rate is set equal to one ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "figures 4 and 5 show the outage probability , i.e. @xmath214 , versus snr for three proposed schemes along with those of the conventional cmf and df relaying schemes for @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 and @xmath220 , respectively . for the df strategy , the best relay with maximum rate",
    "jointly decodes the users messages utilizing the successive interference cancellation method ( [ 4 ] and [ 20 ] ) , and then transmits them separately to the destination . from this figures ,",
    "the icmf and afc methods perform significantly better than the cmf and df methods , especially at high snrs . for example , for @xmath219 and at outage probability of @xmath221 ,",
    "the proposed icmf and afc schemes perform approximately @xmath222 and @xmath223 better than the cmf and the df strategies , respectively . moreover ,",
    "both the icmf and afc methods achieve significantly higher diversity order than cmf in which due to the rank failure problem at the destination , the diversity order is low .",
    "as realized from the figures , the hcaf always shows better performance than icmf ; the amount of the improvement decreases with the inter - relay channel qualities , i.e. , higher @xmath224 .",
    "for example , at outage probability of @xmath221 , for @xmath225 and @xmath226 , hcaf outperforms icmf approximately @xmath227 and @xmath228 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , icmf can perform better than the afc for @xmath224 higher than a certain threshold , due to the fact that the icmf requires each relay to correctly decode the other relays transmissions in order to utilizes the previously transmitted equations .",
    "for example at outage @xmath221 , while at @xmath225 , icmf performs approximately @xmath229 worse than the afc , at @xmath219 it performs @xmath230 better . note although the df outperforms cmf in these figures , the cmf can have a better performance than df under very simple scenarios such as two way relay channels , where the probability of rank failure is low [ 8 ] .    in fig .",
    "6 , we consider the case with @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath231 , and @xmath219 . by comparison of figs . 5 and 6",
    ", it can be realized that the performance of the proposed schemes is better when the channels from the relays to the destination experience higher snr , i.e. , higher @xmath232 . as can be observed and expected , the effect of @xmath232 on the performance of afc is more substantial than the other schemes , and the amount of the improvement of icmf over afc decreases for high @xmath232 .",
    "for example , at @xmath231 and @xmath233 , and at outage @xmath221 , icmf performs approximately @xmath234 and @xmath230 better than afc , respectively .    in fig .",
    "7 , the effect of the inter - relays channels qualities , i.e. @xmath235 , on the performance is considered . in this figure , we have @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218",
    ". as we can see , icmf with @xmath224 larger than @xmath233 outperforms the centralized optimal cmf with global knowledge and the modified icmf ( please see appendix 2 for introduction ) performs similar to the optimal cmf .",
    "in addition , although the perfromance is degraded by the decrease of @xmath235 , the optimal but impractical approach performs only about @xmath229 better than the icmf at very poor inter - relay links , i.e. , @xmath236 .    in fig .",
    "8 , the effect of the number of relays on the performance has been studied and compared .",
    "the values of the parameters are : @xmath215 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 , and @xmath237 and @xmath238 . by the increase of the number of relays , the performance and also the diversity order",
    "are significantly improved .",
    "for example at outage @xmath239 and the parameter setting of the figure , the proposed schemes with @xmath216 lead to approximately @xmath240 better than the ones with @xmath237 .    in fig .",
    "9 , we consider three users and three relays , i.e. @xmath241 and @xmath216 , and we set @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 . at outage probability of @xmath221",
    ", it can be observed that the proposed schemes have approximately @xmath242 better perfromance than the df method , and provide significant improvment in comparison with the cmf scheme . as observed from figs .",
    "4 and 8 , the performance gain of the proposed schemes , compared to the state - of - the - art approaches , increases with the number of users .",
    "in this paper , we considered different relaying strategies for multi - user multi - relay networks , named as icmf , afc , and hcaf . in these strategies ,",
    "new ideas are exploited to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional cmf strategy and to provide efficient and reliable transmission frameworks for multiuser cooperative networks . in icmf , each relay exploits the previously transmitted equations , in a distributed and cooperative manner , to extract a new independent equation with highest computation rates . in afc , the relays amplify and forward their received signals and the destination , as a center of computation , recovers all required equations . in hcaf ,",
    "a combination of icmf and afc approaches are used in which whenever the highest computation rate of the relays is lower than the target rate , the relays switch from computing nodes to amplifying nodes .",
    "numerical results indicate that the outage performance and diversity order of the proposed strategies are considerably better than those of the conventional cmf and df strategies specially at high number of users or relays .",
    "moreover , numerical results show that icmf performs better than afc only when the links among the relays experience high quality .",
    "it is notable that the complexity of afc is much lower than that of the icmf .",
    "hcaf strategy outperforms the icmf , at the cost of more complicated receiver .",
    "finally , the icmf and hcaf schemes , independent of the number of relays ( @xmath15 ) , need @xmath136 time slots to transmit the @xmath1 users messages , in contrast to afc and cmf that require @xmath75 time slots .",
    "from ( 24 ) , the optimum coefficient vectors are obtained by minimizing the following function : @xmath243 from the definition of @xmath97 in ( 21 ) , we have , @xmath244 hence , we can write @xmath245 the optimum value for @xmath104 is obtained by setting the derivative of @xmath246 with respect to @xmath104 equal to zero @xmath247 which leads to : @xmath248 in a similar way , to obtain the optimum value for @xmath105 , we set : @xmath249 which leads to : @xmath250 thus , the theorem is proved .",
    "assume that a central coordinator has access to all relays channels information , or equivalently it knows all the equations coefficients recovered all the relays , and selects simultaneously @xmath1 linearly - independent equations among them .",
    "this method , called optimal centralized cmf , is the asymptotic case of the method proposed in [ 14 ] when @xmath251 goes to infinity with considering only @xmath1 time slots for relays to destination transmission .",
    "also consider a modified version of our proposed icmf method , in which the relays do not use the previously selected and transmitted equations for recovering the current equation , in each stage .",
    "it is clear that the performance of original icmf is better than modified icmf .",
    "note that for the modified icmf the rate of equation recovered in step @xmath76 in relay @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath128 reduces from ( 27 ) to ( 7 ) .    here , we prove that the modified icmf method achieves the same rate as the optimal centralized cmf .",
    "consider that the all equations coefficients known by the central coordinator are sorted in descending order in terms of their computation rates defined in ( 7 ) , and are denoted by ecvs @xmath252 and their corresponding computation rates @xmath253 .",
    "the central coordinator searches among all the possible @xmath1-independent equations combinations , i.e. sets @xmath67 , to choose linearly - independent ecvs @xmath254 with maximum overall rate , similar to the processes described in section ii , as follows : @xmath255 on the other hand , we have two steps in modified icmf : first , at each stage , for each relay , the best equation that is independent of the previously selected and transmitted equations is found .",
    "then , using timer setting method , the best equation among the ones recovered by the relays at that stage is selected .",
    "this procedure continues until @xmath1 linearly independent equations @xmath256 are selected .",
    "hence , when the inter - relays links are strong enough such that the computation rates of all previously transmitted equations at the relays are not decreased , i.e. , @xmath257 in ( 16 ) for all @xmath258 and @xmath22 is equal or greater than @xmath128 in ( 7 ) , for the last selected equation in modified icmf , we have @xmath259 it is clear that we can rewrite ( 81 ) as @xmath260 now suppose that the optimal approach has a rate higher than the modified icmf , i.e. , we have    @xmath261 . from ( 82 ) , @xmath262 is the ecv with the highest rate among all the ecvs that are linearly independent of @xmath263 .",
    "this implies that any ecv with a rate higher than @xmath264 is linearly dependent to the set @xmath263 . as a result",
    ", we have @xmath265 which indicates that the dimension of the space spanned by vectors @xmath254 is at most @xmath266 , but this contradicts the assumption of linear - independency of these equations .",
    "hence , the modified icmf achieves the same rate as the optimal centralized cmf , without requiring to collect all equations recovered by all relays in a coordinator center . moreover , since original icmf , in each stage , takes advantage of the previously recovered equations in decoding of current equation , it can achieve a rate higher than the modified icmf and optimal centralized cmf .",
    "from ( 60 ) , the optimum values are obtained by minimizing the following function : @xmath267 from the definition of @xmath183 in ( 56 ) , we easily obtain : @xmath268 hence , we have @xmath269 the optimum value of @xmath190 is the solution of @xmath270 hence , @xmath192 in a similar way , the optimum value of @xmath191 is found from the solution of @xmath271 which leads to @xmath272 thus , the theorem is proved .    1 a. nosratinia , t.e .",
