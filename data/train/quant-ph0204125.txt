    "in 1948 casimir made the remarkable prediction that there is an attractive force between a pair uncharged parallel plane perfect conductors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , he argued that this force arises solely from a shift in the energy of the vacuum state of the quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "an early attempt by sparnaay @xcite to observe this force was inconclusive , but in recent years several new experiments @xcite have been performed which seem to give good agreement with casimir s prediction .",
    "( to be more precise , most of these experiments actually measure the force between a plate and a sphere and incorporate a theoretical correction to compare to casimir s result .",
    "of the recent experiments , only that of bressi _ et al _ @xcite uses two parallel plates . )",
    "if the energy of the vacuum state is zero in the limit of infinite plate separation , then the attractive force found by casimir would seem to imply a negative vacuum energy at finite separation .",
    "in fact , brown and maclay @xcite showed that for perfectly conducting plates , one has a constant negative vacuum energy density .",
    "this conclusion is of great theoretical interest , because negative energy density has the potential to cause some rather bizarre effects in gravity theory .",
    "( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . )",
    "however , questions have been raised as to whether the negative energy density will still arise in a more realistic treatment in which the plates are not perfect conductors @xcite .",
    "in particular , helfer and lang @xcite calculated the energy density outside of a single half - space filled with a nondispersive dielectric material and obtained a positive result .",
    "they interpreted this as a positive self - energy density associated with a single plate which would add to the negative interaction energy density between a pair of plates .",
    "helfer and lang conjecture that the net casimir energy density might be positive when the self energy is accounted for .",
    "if this conjecture is correct , then the situation would be analogous to that of the energy density in classical electrostatics .",
    "a pair of oppositely charged particles have a negative interaction energy , but the net energy density , which is proportional to the square of the electric field , is always positive .",
    "however , the helfer and lang calculation does not include dispersion , which is essential in a realistic treatment .",
    "numerous authors , beginning with lifshitz @xcite , have studied the effects of dispersion upon casimir forces . however ,",
    "these authors have been concerned with the force or the total energy , and not the local energy density .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a calculation of the casimir energy density in a model in which dispersion is included . for this purpose",
    ", we will use the methods of source theory developed by schwinger and coworkers @xcite .",
    "this is a method based upon the calculation of green s functions which is especially well suited to dissipative materials , and was used by schwinger _ et al _ @xcite to rederive the results of lifshitz .",
    "milonni and shih @xcite have used conventional quantum electrodynamics to reproduce some of the results of source theory .",
    "there has also been considerable interest in recent years in quantization of the electromagnetic field inside dissipative materials using operator methods @xcite .",

    "[ sec : gf ] we review the source theory approach as applied to parallel interfaces of dielectric media . in sect .",
    "[ sec : one ] we compute the expectation values of the squares of the electric and magnetic fields in the vacuum region outside a half - space filled with a uniform dispersive dielectric .",

    "this section is a review of the formalism of schwinger _",

    "one begins by writing the maxwell equations for the macroscopic electromagnetic fields produced by an external polarization source @xmath0 , which formally describes the zero point fluctuations of the fields will be used in this paper .",
    "also , it is assumed that the magnetic permeability is unity . ]",
    "@xmath1    where @xmath2  is the dielectric constant of the medium .",
    "the wave equation for the electric field resulting from the maxwell equations is    @xmath3    by assuming a linear relation between sources and fields , the electric field can be written as a spacetime integral    @xmath4    where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a green s dyadic , which satisfies ( [ wave ] ) with a @xmath8-function source .",
    "let @xmath9 where @xmath10 . from ( [ wave ] ) and ( [ sol ] )",
    ", it follows that @xmath11 satisfies the following equation :    @xmath12    so far , the discussion has been purely classical . at this point ,",
    "et al _ @xcite",
    "use source theory to identify the green s dyadic @xmath7 with an `` effective product of electric fields ''    @xmath13    we can interpret this as the fourier transform of the electric field correlation function . from the maxwell equation @xmath14 * * , * * one finds the corresponding expression for the magnetic field :    @xmath15    note that @xmath16 makes its first appearance in these expressions .",
    "these expressions can be identified with the vacuum expectation values of products of field operators , which appear in the more conventional field theory approach to quantization of the electromagnetic field . from now",
    "onward , we revert to units in which @xmath17 . in order to calculate the field correlation functions",
    ", one needs to find the green s function @xmath18 occurring in ( [ gwave ] ) .",
    "this amounts to solving a classical boundary value problem .    the interfaces between the media are chosen to be perpendicular to the @xmath19 direction , so for now it will only matter that the dielectric constant changes in the @xmath19 direction only .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to introduce a transverse spatial fourier transform    @xmath20    where the vector @xmath21 can be chosen to point along the @xmath22 axis ( @xmath23 ) .    some components of @xmath24are found to be @xcite    [ gcomps ] @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , the `` transverse electric '' , and @xmath28 , the `` transverse magnetic '' green s functions satisfy    [ gegh ] @xmath29 g^{e}(z , z^{\\prime } ) & = & \\delta ( z - z^{\\prime } ) ,   \\label{ge } \\\\",

    "one way of removing this singularity is to allow the position of the boundary to fluctuate .",

    "we have also assumed zero temperature throughout this paper . for systems at room temperature , this should be a good approximation when the separations are of the order of a few micrometers .",
    "more generally , one can ignore thermal effects at distances small compared to @xmath170 .",
    "contrary to the view expressed by lamoreaux @xcite , the appearance of negative energy density in a quantum field theory is very natural .",
