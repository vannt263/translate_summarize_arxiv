    "numerical simulations have clearly shown that the global characteristics of the remnants of binary mergers between two equal - mass spiral galaxies , called major mergers , resemble those of early - type galaxies ( _ i.e _ ellipticals & lenticulars ) , hereafter etgs @xcite .",
    "modern work tends to quantify in detail the properties of major and minor merger remnants , together with thorough comparisons with observed properties of etgs .    in this paper",
    ", we further examine the role of the initial conditions ( mass ratios , impact parameters , relative velocities , inclinations and spins of the progenitors ) on the morphology and the kinematics of the remnants of binary galaxy mergers .",
    "we build two - dimensional momentum ( intensity , velocity and velocity dispersion ) maps of the merger remnants and analyse their apparent properties , directly linked with their orbital structures @xcite .",
    "using two - dimensional maps enables us to compare our merger remnants directly with the complete , volume - limited sample of 260 local etgs from the atlas@xmath0 survey @xcite .",

    "i.e _ violent relaxation , which can significantly impact the morphology and kinematics of merger remnants @xcite .",
    "we have simulated binary mergers of spiral galaxies with mass ratios of 1:1 , 2:1 , 3:1 and 6:1 . the first progenitor , which is defined as the most massive for unequal - mass mergers , has a baryonic mass of 1.3  @xmath1  10@xmath3  m@xmath4 . the bulge fraction is @xmath5 and the gas fraction in the disc is usually 10 per cent ( 33 per cent in some 2:1 mergers ) .",
    "this initial galaxy is representative for a _",
    "spiral galaxy .",
    "the other progenitor has its total mass determined by the mass ratio and a gas fraction of 10 per cent .",
    "the main difference with the first progenitor is the lower bulge fraction with @xmath6 .",
    "this second progenitor galaxy is denoted as the _ sc _ spiral progenitor .",
    "we simulate 70 galaxy mergers with different initial conditions .",
    "we vary five parameters to study their importance on the properties of the final remnant : the mass ratio , the inclination of the spiral _ wrt _ the orbital plane , the impact parameter , the relative velocity of the spirals and the orientation of the spin of the spirals .",
    "the spin of the spirals can be then either direct ( parallel ) or retrograde ( anti - parallel ) _ wrt _ the orbital spin .",

    "the spiral progenitors have a direct spin , in black symbols the spirals have a retrograde spin _ wrt _ the orbital spin.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to quantify the global kinematics of each system , using the velocity and velocity dispersion maps , we measure the @xmath7 parameter , which is a robust proxy for the stellar projected angular momentum defined in @xcite .",
    "this parameter is used to separate etgs in two families : the fast rotators and the slow rotators ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for detailed properties on these families ) . to quantify the morphology",
    ", we measure the ellipticity @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the semi major- and minor - axes , respectively . to compute these two parameters , we project our simulated merger remnants over 200 differents viewing angles to obtain statistically representative results .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath11 diagram for the 70 high - resolution simulations of binary mergers for their 200 projections .",
    "all projected galaxies which are above ( _ resp . _ below ) the black line",
    "are classified as fast rotators ( _ resp . _",
    "slow rotators ) .",
    "we first note that almost all the merger remnants formed with a 3:1 or 6:1 are classified as fast rotators .",
    "they preserved the structure of the input fast rotating spiral progenitors .",
    "major spiral mergers ( with mass ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 ) lead to both fast and slow rotators .",
    "a look at their velocity maps reveals that most of the slow rotators hold a stellar kinematically distinct core ( kdc ) in their 1 - 3 central kilo - parsec : these kdcs are built from the stellar components of the progenitors .",
    "the mass ratio is then a fundamental parameter for the formation of slow rotators in binary mergers .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig2 ] shows the number of fast and slow rotators for the 1:1 and 2:1 mergers as a function of the inclination of the _ sb _ spiral progenitor ( a negative inclination occurs when the spin of the spiral is retrograde _ wrt _ the orbital spin ) .",
    "the formation of the slow rotators requires a retrograde spin for the _ sb _ spiral with respect to the orbital angular momentum . due to its massive bulge , the spin of the _ sb _ spiral is preserved during the merger while the _ sc _ spiral ( with a lower bulge ) always acquires the direct spin of the orbit .",
    "it thus forms a merger remnant with two contributions in counter - rotation and forms , in our simulations , an apparent kdc .",
    "these slow rotating merger remnants are then representative of the 2-@xmath12 galaxies observed in the atlas@xmath0 survey @xcite .",
    "the properties of these observed galaxies indicate that they are composed of two counter - rotating components and could have been formed via a single binary merger ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the galmer project consists of one of the largest publicly available sample of numerical simulations of interacting galaxies @xcite : with a high number of simulations but a relatively low resolution ( a total number of particles of 1.2  @xmath1  10@xmath13 and a softening length of 280  pc ) .    to confirm the importance of the spins orientation of the progenitors , we have selected in the galmer database the simulations of 1:1 spiral",
    "  spiral mergers .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig2 ] shows the @xmath11 diagram for the edge - on view of the merger remnants .",
    "this plot confirms our previous findings : merging spirals with a retrograde orientation _ wrt _ the orbital spin produces a remnant with a lower angular momentum content .",
    "however , there is a large scatter in the @xmath7 values of these simulated galaxies .",
    "this is probably due to the lower resolution of the simulations : a look at the velocity maps of the merger remnants reveals a high level of numerical noise .",
