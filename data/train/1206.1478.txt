    "perturbation theory is these days a standard tool in theoretical cosmology . since the introduction of the theory more than sixty years ago , the `` gauge issue '' has been troubling cosmologists .",
    "although the problem has been resolved by now , at all orders in perturbation theory , there still seems to be some confusion as to its origins .",
    "we aim at clarifying these issues in this short note , by highlighting previous results that might be well known to the specialist , but not necessarily to the wider community .",
    "+ after the pioneering work by lifshitz in 1946 @xcite , bardeen in 1980 @xcite demonstrated how the gauge issue can be rigorously solved in the metric based approach .",
    "the reviews by kodama and sasaki @xcite and mukhanov , feldman and brandenberger @xcite further contributed to the success of this approach . more recently the gauge issue has also been studied beyond linear order in cosmological perturbation theory , leading to a rich body of work using the bardeen and related gauge - invariant formalisms @xcite",
    ".    a different approach has been developed , which is usually referred to as the `` covariant '' approach , following ellis and bruni @xcite ( and earlier work by @xcite ) . however , as we show below , also the covariant approach has to face the gauge issue if a `` background '' spacetime is introduced .",
    "+ but what do we mean by gauge dependence in cosmological perturbation theory , where does it actually come from , and what makes it so difficult ?",
    "in cosmological perturbation theory we split quantities into a background and small perturbations , both for the matter variables and the metric .",
    "gauge dependence then stems from requiring a unique background spacetime on which the background quantities are defined , that does not follow the coordinate or gauge transformation , whereas the perturbations do obey the transformation .",
    "this allows us to talk about e.g.  _ the _ friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background around which we perturb our quantities .",
    "before we define once more what we mean by gauge - invariance in the setting of cosmological perturbation theory below , let us briefly state what it is not .",
    "it should not be mistaken for or mixed up with covariance , the requirement that the governing equations do not depend on the coordinate system chosen .",
    "indeed , it is well known that covariance can be broken in cosmology without conceptual or other problems arising , e.g.  in order to choose a particular coordinate system that makes the calculation simpler @xcite .",
    "gauge - invariance in cosmological perturbation theory should also not be confused with the gauge choice in standard general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "we can choose four arbitrary coordinate functions in the metric tensor ( thanks to the four constraint equations in einstein s field equations , see e.g.  ref .",
    "in cosmological perturbation theory the symmetries of the physical spacetime , namely homogeneity and isotropy , lead us to choose a background that is frw ( with zero background curvature for convenience ) , and we can then use covariance to choose our coordinates in the background such that the line element has a particularly simple form , i.e. ds^2=dt^2+a^2(t)_ijdx^idx^j , where @xmath0 is the scale factor and @xmath1 the flat background metric .",
    "this is related to the `` geodesic slicing '' in numerical relativity , which is selected by choosing a lapse function normalised to unity , and choosing a vanishing shift vector selects gaussian normal coordinates ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "hence the `` standard gr coordinate freedom '' is used , actually used up , in choosing and specifying the background . + this note is aimed at the non - specialist and we try to keep our discussions as non - technical as possible , working rather by way of example than by introducing theorems . nevertheless , in the following two sections we have to define gauge - dependence and gauge - invariance in a more rigorous way than above .",
    "in section [ relating ] we show how quantities in the covariant formalism are related to the ones in standard metric perturbation theory , and comment briefly on the issue of non - locality in perturbation theory in section [ nonlocal ] , and conclude with a short discussion in section [ discussion ] .",
    "finally we highlight in appendix [ example ] the difference between covariance and gauge - invariance .",
    "we use predominantly coordinate time @xmath2 , and denote derivatives with respect to @xmath2 with a dot .",
    "conformal time @xmath3 is related to @xmath2 by @xmath4 , where @xmath0 is the scale factor .",
    "greek indices @xmath5 , and @xmath6 range from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , lower case latin indices , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , have the range @xmath12 .",
    "so far we have mentioned that there is a problem in cosmological perturbation theory often referred to as the `` gauge issue '' , but in the previous section we only sketched it very roughly .",
    "let us therefore now turn to the origin of gauge dependence and define what we mean by _ gauge _ , _ gauge dependence _ , and _",
    "gauge invariance_. we shall use the frw background universe as an example spacetime . as stated above , we shall attempt to be as non - technical as possible in this note , and refer the interested reader to the seminal papers by stewart and walker @xcite and stewart @xcite for technical details , and to ref .",
    "@xcite whose notation we follow where possible .",
    "+ the physical domain ( `` the universe '' ) in which we work in cosmology can be regarded as a single manifold @xmath13 . in perturbation theory , following ref .",
    "@xcite we introduce another , fiducial , manifold @xmath14 ( frequently referred to as the `` background '' manifold ) .",
    "a correspondence or map ( one - to - one mapping or diffeomorphism ) between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is referred to as a _ gauge _ and the correspondence is generated by a vector field , the _ gauge generator_.    as illustrated in fig .",

    "then relabelling the points on @xmath13 induces a _",

    "when we change the coordinate system on the physical space @xmath13 by a small amount @xmath21 and require that the coordinates of the background remain unperturbed , to keep a unique background spacetime ( e.g.  the frw background in standard cosmology ) the perturbed quantities on @xmath13 will undergo a gauge transformation generated by this relabelling of coordinates .",
    "+ let us rephrase the above in a slightly more technical form .",

    "studying the transformation behaviour of the perturbed quantities allows us to `` fix '' or correct this different and disparate behaviour of the quantities ( i.e.  the background quantities remain fixed , the perturbations are allowed to vary ) , and construct gauge - invariant quantities ( free of gauge - artefacts , the @xmath28 defined in eq .",

    "note that @xmath29 .",

    "we now turn to the``covariant approach '' to cosmological perturbation theory and how it deals with any potentially ensuing gauge issues .",
    "one might be tempted , given the approach s name , that here the gauge issue is avoided altogether , after all gr does nt suffer from the perturbation theory gauge issue besides the `` normal '' coordinate freedom , as pointed out in section [ intro ] .    the covariant approach to perturbation theory @xcite allows in principle to avoid the gauge issue , as it does not require to specify the metric from the beginning of the calculation . however , as soon as one imposes a split into a particular background and perturbations , the same issues as described above in section [ origin ] and troubling the metric approach will `` haunt '' the covariant approach .",
    "one possibility to remove gauge artefacts is to use the stewart - walker lemma , and use quantities that vanish in the background .",
    "hence in frw we can construct the spatial gradient of a scalar , and since the background is time dependent only , this has no correspondence in the background ( i.e.  removes gauge terms , see below ) .",
    "however , this only works at linear order in a standard frw background : if we think perturbatively again , as the second order quantities `` live '' in the first order time and space dependent background , which does allow gradients .",
    "this is also the reason why second order tensor perturbations are no longer gauge - invariant , as they have first order tensor perturbations acting as a background@xcite .",
    "we can now relate quantities in the covariant formalism and in the bardeen formalism ( see e.g.  refs .",

    "( [ project ] ) , relative to some vector field , usually chosen to be the fluid four - velocity .",
    "this suggests that the quantities constructed in this way are closely related to quantities in the bardeen formalism in comoving gauge .",

    "we are using the definitions from ref .",
    "@xcite , and only consider scalar quantities .",

    "0(v+b ) , which is what we expected .",
    "we finally reflect on another topic of frequent discussions with colleagues , which was also discussed recently in refs .",
    "@xcite , namely the issue of whether perturbation theory is `` local '' or `` non - local '' , with regard to metric and covariant approaches .",
    "the question here is , how to deal with gradient terms that appear in the governing equations .",
    "gradient terms are already present in the definitions of the perturbed variables , e.g.  in the definition of the 4-velocity , eq .",
    "( [ def4vel ] ) above , or in the spatial section of the metric tensor , if we decompose the variables on spatial 3-hypersurfaces .",
    "this decomposition leads to the standard `` nomenclature '' for matter and metric perturbations , labelling them by their transformation behaviour on the spatial 3-hypersurfaces : we can decompose 3-vectors into a scalar ( the curl - free part ) and a divergence - free vector , and similarly 3-tensors into scalars , vectors ( divergence - free ) , and tensors ( divergence - free and traceless ) .",
    "this decomposition is popular in cosmological perturbation theory , as at linear order the governing equations for the different types of perturbations decouple @xcite , which simplifies the calculations .",
    "to get rid of the gradients in the ensuing equations , we have to formally integrate the equations , or if we work in fourier space , solve the governing equations for the mode functions ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "this is straight forward at linear order , where only simple operators of the form @xmath55 ( acting on the whole equation ) , or @xmath56 arise .",
    "however beyond linear order this is no longer the case , and to rewrite the governing equations in closed form in terms of scalar quantities we will inevitable pick up inverse gradient terms ( see e.g.  refs.@xcite ) .",
    "it is these inverse gradients terms that are usually referred to as `` non - local '' .",
    "this also means that in fourier space this will lead to mode - mixing , which requires solving convolution integrals .",
    "+ there are several ways to deal with this issue : a ) we can use a large scale or super - horizon approximation and a gradient expansion , that is simply neglect the gradient terms at a particular order ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "\\b ) alternatively , we can keep the gradient terms as they are without solving for the scalars , as is common in `` standard gr '' and the covariant formalism , as advocated in e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ( at linear and higher order , respectively ) .",
    "but then we can only calculate e.g.  the power spectrum of the gradient of the density perturbation . to get the power spectrum of the density perturbation itself",
    ", we will have to invert the equations to get rid of the gradients .",
    "we could also in the bardeen formalism keep our equations `` local '' , if we do not invert the gradient terms .",
    "but then we would only have governing equations for the gradients of scalars as in the covariant formalism , and have the same problems as mentioned above .",
    "\\c ) or we can simply suffer the consequences of deriving governing equations for the scalar variables at higher order , namely the introduction of non - local terms , and very complex equations . however , although complex the ensuing equations can be readily solved numerically ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    to conclude this section",
    ": if we want governing equations for purely scalar quantities , both the covariant and the bardeen formalism will lead to equations with inverse gradient or non - local terms .",
    "as gr is a non - linear theory , we usually have to resort to some form of approximative scheme to solve the governing equations .",
    "perturbation theory allows us to solve the equations iteratively order by order .    in cosmological perturbation theory",
    "we have to allow for perturbations of spacetime itself , by using a perturbed metric tensor and correspondingly perturbing the coordinates .",
    "this is a major difference to classical perturbation theory in e.g.  fluid dynamics , which uses a fixed euclidean or minkowsky spacetime .",
    "+ gauge dependence in cosmological perturbation theory comes from the need to work with a unique background spacetime , that remains fixed under small coordinate transformations .",
    "we can begin with the physical spacetime @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , on which we define all unperturbed variables .",
    "we then start our perturbative expansion , by introducing a fiducial background spacetime @xmath14 on which we define the background quantities , both matter and metric variables .",
    "the perturbations are then defined as the difference between the quantities defined on the physical spacetime @xmath13 and the unperturbed quantities on @xmath14 .",
    "we relate the background quantity to its perturbed version ( on @xmath13 ) , i.e.   get a correspondence between the perturbed and unperturbed realisations of the quantities using a one - to - one map , parametrised by a vector field , the gauge generator .",
    "a gauge transformation changes this correspondence and hence the perturbations unless they are gauge - invariant .",
    "we can always construct gauge - invariant variables , at any order , by studying their transformation behaviour , and then combining the variables in such a way that the gauge artefacts that they pick up in the transformation cancel .",
    "note that a coordinate transformation transforms all the coordinates , i.e.  in both the background and physical spacetimes , whereas a gauge transformation does not affect the background quantities .",
    "+ the gauge issue outlined in this note will arise in any theory that keeps the background fixed under small coordinate transformations .",
    "once we have decided to use cosmological perturbation theory , a choice of gauge is therefore always required if such a theory is used , even when dealing with physically measurable quantities and working on small scales . hence dealing with the gauge issue",
    "is not optional or a question of taste , it is dictated by the fact that we have chosen cosmological perturbation theory and a unique background spacetime . of course",
    ", for many applications newtonian theory will be sufficient , and hence no gauge issue will arise .",
    "moreover , we should consider the gauge freedom as an opportunity to choose the simplest form of the governing equations possible , not as a problem .",
    "as long as we use the formalism with care , namely make sure that no gauge artefacts or `` unphysical degrees of freedom '' are left in the equations , there will be no ambiguity when we relate observations with theory .",
