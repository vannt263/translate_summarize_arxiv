    "the radiation pressure coupling between the optical field inside an optomechanical cavity and its moving mirror has been employed for a wide range of applications such as the cooling of the vibrational mode of the moving mirror to its quantum mechanical ground state @xcite , ultrahigh precision measurements @xcite and the detection of gravitational waves @xcite and also providing a good approach for fundamental studies of the transition between the quantum and the classical world@xcite .    on the other hand , in hybrid systems consisting of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) trapped inside a high finesse optical cavity @xcite interacting dispersively with the optical field of the cavity , an effective optomechanical coupling comes into existence in which the fluctuations of the atomic field of the bec ( the bogoliubov mode ) plays the role of the vibration mode of the moving mirror in an optomecanocal cavity . for low photon numbers or in the weakly interacting regime the dynamics",
    "can be restricted to the first motional mode of the bec which plays the role of the mechanical oscillator@xcite .",
    "optomechanical systems have also attracted considerable attention in connection with quantum state engineering ; because of the great possibilities they are expected to produce nonclassical states of both the mechanical oscillator @xcite and the cavity field @xcite . from the point of view of quantum mechanics a system which may be a macroscopic object like the moving mirror of an optomechanical cavity can be in a coherent superposition of different quantum states .",
    "recently , due to improved technology , there has been a growing interest in the possibility of observing such superposition states , commonly known as schrdinger cat states @xcite .",
    "coherent states of the electromagnetic field mode inside an opical cavity is a good candidate for these macroscopic states @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown the possibility of generating motional nonlinear coherent states and their superposition for an undamped vibrating micromechanical membrane inside an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "one of the most important characteristics of the optomechanical systems is a kind of inherent nonlinearity which is due to the mutual interaction between the optical field and the matter inside ( the moving mirror or the atomic ensemble ) @xcite .",
    "this nonlinearity leads to realization of the kerr effect in such systems @xcite . in hybrid optomechanical systems containing a bec there",
    "exists another kind of nonlinearity which is due to the atom - atom interaction . both kinds of these nonlinearities have considerable effects on the optical properties of the system like the bistability of the cavity @xcite and the squeezing of the output optical field @xcite and also on the mechanical properties like the cooling process of the moving mirror @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite we showed that the nonlinear atom - atom interaction in a hybrid system consisting of a bec inside an optical cavity is very similar to the interaction hamiltonian of a degenerate parametric amplifier ( dpa ) which can lead to the normal mode splitting ( nms ) phenomenon . in a dpa",
    "a pump beam generates a signal beam by interacting with a @xmath0 nonlinearity .",
    "this process has long been considered as an important source of the squeezed state of the radiation field @xcite .    in the present paper , we consider a one dimensional bec interacting dispersively with the optical field of an optical cavity . in the weak - interaction regime and",
    "using the bogoliubov approximation , the bec can be described by a single mode quantum field ( the bogoliubov mode ) which fluctuates about a classical mean field ( condensate mode ) .",
    "such a system behaves as a so - called atomic parametric amplifier ( apa ) in which the condensate acts as an atomic pump field and the bogoliubov mode plays the role of the signal mode in the dpa .",
    "besides , the _ s_-wave scattering frequency of atom - atom interaction plays the role of the nonlinear gain parameter .    in the absence of damping processes",
    ", we calculate the time evolution of the state vector of the system and show that the degree of squeezing of the quadratures of the bogoliubov mode can be controlled by the _ s_-wave scattering frequency of atomic collisions .",
    "since the _ s_-wave scattering frequency is controllable through the transverse trapping potential @xcite then the degree of squeezing of the bogoliubov mode becomes controllable .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sech ]",
    "we derive the hamiltonian of the system and diagonalize it in two steps . in section [ secdyn ]",
    "the evolution operator of the system in the schrdinger picture and in the absence of damping processes is calculated and then the reduced density operator of the bogoliubov mode of the bec is derived . in section [ secq ]",
    "the effect of atomic collisions on the @xmath1 function of the bogoliubov mode is investigated . in section [ secquad ]",
    "we will show how one can manipulate the suqeezing degree of the quadratures of the bogoliubov mode throught the _",
    "s_-wave scattering frequency .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section [ seccon ] .",
    "as schematically shown in fig.[fig : fig1 ] , we consider a system consisting of a bec of @xmath2 two - level atoms with mass @xmath3 and transition frequency @xmath4 inside an optical cavity with length @xmath5 . the cavity is driven through one of its mirrors by a laser with frequency @xmath6 , and wavenumber @xmath7 .",
    "we assume the bec to be confined in a cylindrically symmetric trap with a transverse trapping frequency @xmath8 and negligible longitudinal confinement along the @xmath9 direction @xcite . in this way we can describe the dynamics within an effective one - dimensional model by quantizing the atomic motional degree of freedom along the @xmath9 axis only .        in the dispersive regime where the laser pump is far detuned from the atomic resonance ( @xmath10 exceeds the atomic linewidth @xmath11 by orders of magnitude ) ,",

    "s_-wave scattering length @xcite .    in the weakly interacting regime , where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the recoil frequency of the condensate atoms ) , and under the bogoliubov approximation @xcite , the atomic field operator can be expanded as @xmath21 where the first term is the condensate mode which is considered as a c - number and the operator @xmath22 in the second term is the annihilation operator of the bogoliubov mode .",
    "substituting this expansion into eq.([h1 ] ) , we can find the hamiltonian of the system in the following form @xmath23 here , we have assumed that the external laser drives the cavity for a limited time until the optical field and the bogoliubov mode are prepared in a coherent and a vacuum state , respectively and then it is turned off and we let the system evolves by itself . in eq.([hopa ] ) @xmath24 is the cavity effective detuning , @xmath25 the frequency of the bogoliubov mode , @xmath26 the s - wave scattering frequency and @xmath27 is the waist of the optical potential .",
    "the third term of the hamiltonian ( [ hopa ] ) corresponds to the atom - atom interaction and the fourth term is the optomechanical interaction of the bogoliubov mode with the radiation pressure of the optical field with the coupling constant @xmath28 .    in a dpa due to the nonlinear interaction of the pump field with a nonlinear crystal a signal mode in a sqeezed state",
    "is generated @xcite .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian of such a system is @xmath29 where the operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the annihilation operators of the driving field and the signal mode , respectively and @xmath32 is the coupling constant which depends on the second - order susceptibility tensor that mediates the interaction . in the limit of strong driving field when its depletion is negligible ,",
    "it can be considered as a classical field and therefore the interaction hamiltonian can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are , respectively , the amplitude and the phase of the driving field .",
    "as is seen , the interaction hamiltonian of eq.([hdpa ] ) is very similar to the atom - atom interaction in the hamiltonian ( [ hopa ] ) where the bogoliubov mode @xmath36 ( with zero phase ) plays the role of the signal mode @xmath31 .",
    "besides , the _ s_-wave scattering frequency ( @xmath37 ) plays the role of @xmath38 in the dpa hamiltonian . in this way",
    ", we are dealing with an apa where the condensate mode acts as the driving field and the bogoliubov mode acts as the signal mode .    in the following",
    "we will diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ hopa ] ) in two steps and will show that the atom - atom interaction term is responsible for the generation of squeezed states in the bogoliubov mode .      since the radiation pressure of the optical field on the bogoliubov mode acts as a driving field ,",
    "so in the first step of diagonalization we use the displacement operator @xmath39 where the parameter @xmath40 is defined as @xmath41 the action of this displacement unitary transformation on the operators @xmath36 and @xmath42 will give the following results :    [ dcd ] @xmath43    transforming the hamiltonian ( [ hopa ] ) under the unitary operator ( [ d ] ) , one can find @xmath44 after substituting eqs.([dcda ] , [ dcdb ] ) for @xmath45 and @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ dhd1 ] ) the hamiltonian @xmath47 reads @xmath48 as is seen from this equation , the energy structure of the cavity - field hamiltonian , corresponding to the first two terms in the right hand side of eq.([hprime ] ) , becomes the anharmonic one due to the photon - photon interaction induced by the radiation pressure .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hprime ] ) is diagonal in terms of the creation and annihilation operators of the optical field , while it is not diagonal in terms of the operators of the bogoliubov mode due to the presence of atom - atom interaction term .      in order to diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ hprime ] ) in terms of the operators of the bogoliubov mode , @xmath36 and @xmath42",
    ", one can use the squeezing operator @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the squeezing parameter . transforming the operators @xmath36 and @xmath42 under this unitary transformation leads to the following operators :    [ scs ] @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are defined in terms of the squeezing parameter @xmath50 .",
    "the squeezing parameter should be so evaluated that the squeezing operator @xmath54 diagonalizes the hamiltonian ( [ hprime ] ) . if the unitary transformation @xmath54 is applied to eq.([hprime ] ) , then the hamiltonian in eq.([hprime ] ) becomes @xmath55 by using eqs.([scsa],[scsb ] ) , the hamiltonian of eq.([shs1 ] ) takes the following form @xmath56 c^{\\dagger}c\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\hbar\\big[\\mu\\nu\\omega_{c}+\\frac{1}{4}\\omega_{sw}(\\mu^2+\\nu^2)\\big](c^{2}+c^{\\dagger2})\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\hbar\\delta_{c}a^{\\dagger}a-\\hbar(\\omega_{c}+\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_{sw})\\beta^2(a^{\\dagger}a)^2+\\mathcal{e}_{0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this hamiltonian @xmath57 is a constant which has no effect on the dynamics of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "the term in the square brackets of the first term of the hamiltonian ( [ shs2 ] ) is the effective frequency of the bogoliubov mode which we will denote it by the new parameter @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , in order to bring the hamiltonian ( [ shs2 ] ) into the diagonal form , the term in the square brackets in the second line of eq.([shs2 ] ) should be equal to zero . in this way",
    ", we will have the following system of algebraic equations :",
    "@xmath59    with this system of algebraic equations the hamiltonian @xmath60 takes a diagonal form in terms of the operators @xmath36 and @xmath42 as follows : @xmath61    solving the system of algebraic equations for the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 , they are obtained as    [ munu ] @xmath64    where the effective frequency of the bogoliubov mode @xmath58 is @xmath65 in this way using eqs.([munua ] , [ munub ] ) , one can obtain the squeezing parameter @xmath66 .    therefore using the two unitary transformations , i.e.",
    ", the displacement and the squeezing operators [ eqs.([d ] ) , ( [ s ] ) ] , and based on eqs.([shs1]),([dhd1 ] ) the hamiltonian of the system can be transformed into the diagonalized hamiltonian : @xmath67",
    "in this section we are going to study the time evolution of the state vector of the system in the schrdinger picture in the absence of any damping processes i.e. , the time interval in which we observe the system is smaller than the decoherence times of both the optical and the atomic fields .    in order to obtain the time evolution of the state vector of the system in the schrdinger picture we need to calculate the time evolution operator @xmath68 .",
    "however , since the hamiltonian @xmath69 is not diagonal we use eq.([hzegondh ] ) to writ it in terms of the diagonalized hamiltonian @xmath60 in the following form : @xmath70 defining the unitary operator @xmath71 and using eq.([hhzegond ] ) the time evolution operator can be written as follows : @xmath72 in the second line we have used the operator theorems @xcite . since @xmath73 is diagonal , calculation of the exponential function appeared in the last line of eq.([u ] ) is straightforward .",
    "now using the time evolution operator in the form obtained in eq.([u ] ) we can investigate the time evolution of the state vector of the system .",
    "if we assume the optical field of the cavity and the bogoliubov mode of the bec have been initially prepared , respectively , in a coherent and a vacuum state , then the initial state vector of the system is @xmath74 where the indices @xmath31 and @xmath36 refer to the optical field of the cavity and the bogoliubov mode of the condensate , respectively .    in a previous paper @xcite , we showed that by controlling the detuning between the frequencies of the laser pump and the cavity resonance , the fluctuation in the number of atoms in the bogoliubov mode can be minimized . if it reduces to values below unity , one can conclude that the bogoliubov mode has been prepared in the vacuum state .",
    "therefore , the time evolution of the state vector of the system can be evaluated as follows : @xmath75 by expanding the coherent state of the optical field in terms of number states , the state vector of the system can be written as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a squeezed coherent state of the bogoliobov mode ( @xmath36 ) of the condensate . by substituting the right hand side of eq.([hzegond ] ) for @xmath60 in the above equation we will have : @xmath78 here ,",
    "we have used the eigenvalue equation @xmath79 . the last expression in this equation ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath80 denotes the free evolution of a squeezed coherent sate which is given by [ appendix [ apa ] ] : @xmath81 using this equation , the state vector of the system at time @xmath82 reads @xmath83      in order to determine the reduced density operator of the bogoliubov mode , we first construct the density operator of the total system @xmath84 where @xmath85 is given by eq.([psitotal ] ) .",
    "then , taking trace over the degrees of freedom of the optical field , i.e. , @xmath86 $ ] , the reduced density operator of the bogoliubov mode is obtained as follows : @xmath87 where the state vector @xmath88 which is a vector in the hilbert space of the bogoliobov mode is defined as latexmath:[\\[\\label{phic }    here , the time @xmath82 has been replaced with the dimensionless time @xmath90 . besides , since the degrees of freedom of the optical field , i.e. , operators @xmath31 and @xmath91 , are not present in these equations and from now on we just deal with the degrees of freedom of the bogoliubov mode , so we no longer need to retain the index c for identification of the state vectors of the bogoliubov mode and therefore we have deleted it .",
    "using the reduced density operator of the bogoliubov mode , one can calculate any of the distribution functions of this mode . here , we consider the temporal behaviour of the @xmath1 function @xcite of this mode and investigate the effect of atom - atom interaction on the shape of this function .",

    ", the atomic field of the bec can be described by a single mode quantum field in a simple optomechanical model in which the quantum fluctuations of the atomic field ( bogoliubov mode ) is coupled to the radiation pressure of the optical field of the cavity .     and ( b ) the squeezing parameter @xmath207 versus the dimensionless time @xmath200 for different values of the _ s_-wave scattering frequency .",
    "the values of the other parameters have been chosen based on the experimental data of ref.@xcite just like those of fig.[fig : fig2],title=\"fig:\",width=259 ]   and ( b ) the squeezing parameter @xmath207 versus the dimensionless time @xmath200 for different values of the _ s_-wave scattering frequency .",
    "the values of the other parameters have been chosen based on the experimental data of ref.@xcite just like those of fig.[fig : fig2],title=\"fig:\",width=259 ]    .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ]    using the similarity between the atomic interaction in the present model and the interaction potential of a dpa , we have shown that the condensate and the bogoliubov modes in this hybrid system play , respectively , the roles of the pump field and the signal mode in the dpa system .",
    "in fact , as the nonlinear property of the crystal in the dpa system causes the manifestation of quadrature squeezing in the signal mode , in the same way the nonlinear effect of atom - atom interaction in the bec can lead to the generation of squeezing property in the bogoliubove mode of the bec .",
    "therefore , the hybrid system under consideration behaves just like a parametric amplifier in which the _ s_-wave scattering frequency plays the role of the nonlinear gain parameter .",
    "since the _ s_-wave scattering frequency is controllable by the transverse harmonic potential confining the bec , so the degree of squeezing of the bogoliubov mode can be effectively controlled .",
    "the authors wish to thank the office of graduate studies of the university of isfahan for its support .",
    "in this appendix we derive the free evolution of a squeezed sate @xcite .",
    "let us consider a free field described by the hamiltonian @xmath211 and assume that the system has been prepared in an initial squeezed coherent state @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the squeezing parameter , the state @xmath214 is the eigenstate of the annihilation operator @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath215 , and @xmath216 is the vacuum state of the field .",
    "the displacement and squeezing operators is defined as            noting the definition of a squeezed coherent state as @xmath220 we can derive the action of the transformed operator @xmath45 on the state @xmath221 as @xmath222 substituting for @xmath45 from eq.([cpa ] ) in the above equation we obtain : @xmath223 based on this equation @xmath224 is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator @xmath225 with the eigenvalue @xmath40 .",
    "now we want to show that @xmath226 is the eigenstate of the operator @xmath227 . for this purpose",
    "we should determine the action of this operator on the mentioned state vector : @xmath228 now noting that        we will have @xmath230 substituting this result in eq.([c ] ) we will have @xmath231 as is seen from eq.([egsqt ] ) , @xmath226 is the eigenstate of the operator @xmath232 with the eigenvalue @xmath40 .",
    "now , multiplying both sides of eq.([egsqt ] ) by @xmath233 we will have @xmath234    on the other hand comparing this equation with eq.([egsq ] ) which can be rewritten in the following form @xmath235 one can conclude that @xmath226 is a squeezed coherent state : @xmath236 ) and ( [ sqtresult ] ) one goes to the conclusion that the free evolution of an initial squeezed coherent state is given as follows @xmath237        c. genes , d. vitali , p. tombesi , s. gigan , and m. aspelmeyer , phys .",
