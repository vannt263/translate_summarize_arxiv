    "the search for majorana fermions has become an active and exciting pursuit in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "majorana fermions , particles which are their own antiparticles , were originally envisioned by e. majorana in 1937  @xcite in the context of particle physics ( _ i.e. _ , the physics of neutrinos ) .",
    "however , the current search for majorana particles is mostly taking place in condensed matter systems  @xcite where majorana quasi ",
    "particles appear in electronic systems as a result of fractionalization , and as emergent modes occupying non  local zero energy states .",
    "the non  locality of these modes provides the ability to exchange and manipulate fractionalized quasiparticles and leads to non ",
    "abelian braiding statistics  @xcite .",
    "hence , in addition to being of paramount importance for fundamental physics , this property of the majoranas places them at the heart of topological quantum computing schemes  @xcite .",
    "we mention that solid ",
    "state systems , where the majorana mode emerges as a zero energy state of an effective ( but realistic ) low  energy hamiltonian , enable the realization of the majorana operator itself , not just of the majorana particle .",
    "consequently , majorana physics in solid  state systems is in fact much more subtle than originally envisioned by e. majorana in 1937 .",
    "for example , in condensed matter systems the non  local non  abelian topological nature of the majorana modes that are of interest to us is a purely emergent property .",
    "about ten years ago , read and green  @xcite discovered that majorana zero - energy modes can appear quite naturally in 2d chiral p  wave superconductors where these quasiparticles , localized at the vortex cores , correspond to an equal superposition of a particle and a hole . a year later , kitaev  @xcite introduced a very simple toy model for a 1d majorana quantum wire with localized majorana zero  energy modes at the ends .",
    "both these proposals involve spinless p  wave superconductors where one can explicitly demonstrate the existence of majorana zero - energy modes by solving the corresponding mean field hamiltonian .",
    "recently , several groups  @xcite suggested a way to engineer spinless p  wave superconductors in the laboratory using a combination of strong spin ",
    "orbit coupling and superconducting proximity effect , thus opening the possibility of realizing majorana fermions in solid  state systems to the experimental field .",
    "the basic idea of the semiconductor / superconductor proposal  @xcite is that the interplay of spin  orbit interaction , s  wave superconductivity and zeeman spin splitting could , in principle , lead to a topological superconducting phase with localized zero  energy majorana modes in the semiconductor .",
    "since then , there have been many proposals for realizing solid  state majoranas in various superconducting heterostructures  @xcite . among them ,",
    "the most promising ones involve quasi1d semiconductor nanowires with strong spin ",
    "orbit interaction proximity  coupled with an s  wave superconductor  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of this proposal is its simplicity : it does not require any specialized new materials but rather involves a conventional semiconductor with strong rashba coupling such as inas or insb , a conventional superconductor such as al or nb , and an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "high quality semiconductor nanowires can be epitaxially grown ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite for inas and ref .",
    "@xcite for insb ) and are known to have a large spin  orbit interaction strength @xmath0 as well as large lande @xmath1-factor ( @xmath2  @xcite and @xmath3  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , these materials are known to form interfaces that are highly transparent for electrons , allowing one to induce a large superconducting gap @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "thus , semiconductor nanowires show great promise for realizing and observing majorana particles  @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in the superconductor  semiconductor heterostructures the majorana mode is constructed or engineered to exist as a zero  energy state , and as such , it should be experimentally observable in the laboratory under the right conditions .    in a strictly 1d nanowire in contact with a superconductor , the condition for driving the system into a topological superconducting phase  @xcite is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the zeeman splitting due to the in  plane magnetic field , @xmath7 is the chemical potential and @xmath4 is the proximity  induced superconducting gap .",
    "thus , the key to the experimental realization of majorana fermions in this system is the ability to satisfy a certain set of requirements that ensures the stability of the majorana bound states .",
    "the challenging task here is the ability to suppress effects of disorder , control chemical potential fluctuations as well as fluctuations of other parameters .",
    "given that realizing single channel ( or one subband ) nanowire is quite challenging , it is natural to consider semiconductor nanowires in the regime of multi  subband occupancy .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this is a promising route and the existence of majorana fermions does not require strict one dimensionality . in fact , the stability of the topological superconducting phase is enhanced in multiband nanowires due to the presence of  sweet spots \" ( multicritical points in the topological phase diagram , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) in the phase diagram where the system is most robust against chemical potential fluctuations  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we expand on these ideas and explore effects of various perturbations such as disorder in the superconductor and semiconductor , fluctuations in the tunneling matrix elements , etc . on the stability of the topological phase .",
    "our goal is to identify parameter regimes favorable for the exploration of the majorana physics in the laboratory .",
    "we therefore use realistic physical models and realistic values of the parameters throughout this work so that our theoretical results are of direct relevance to experiments looking for majorana modes in nanowires .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ secii ] by introducing a tight  binding model for the semiconductor nanowires , and derive the superconducting proximity effect .",

    "single  channel semiconductor ( sm ) nanowires have been recently proposed@xcite as a possible platform for realizing and observing majorana physics in solid state systems . obtaining strictly one - dimensional ( 1d ) nanowires would raise significant practical challenges@xcite , but this requirement can be relaxed to a less stringent quasi1d condition corresponding to multiband occupancy@xcite .",
    "the physical system proposed for studying majorana physics consists of a strongly spin - orbit interacting semiconductor , e.g. , inas and insb , proximity - coupled to an s - wave superconductor ( sc ) .",
    "the quasi1d sm nanowire is strongly confined in the @xmath8 direction , so that only the lowest corresponding sub - band is occupied , while the weaker confinement in the @xmath9 direction is consistent with a few occupied sub - bands .",
    "consequently , the linear dimensions of the rectangular nanowire satisfy the relation @xmath10 which is the usual physical situation in realistic semiconductor nanowires .",

    "a brute force diagonalization of hamiltonian ( [ hnw ] ) on a lattice containing more than @xmath41 sites would be numerically very expensive .",
    "more importantly , the relevant energy scales in the problem are of the order of a few mev allowing to construct the low - energy model as we show below and significantly reduce the hilbert space .",
    "the largest energy scale is given by the gap between the lowest sub - bands , which , for example , for the first and second subband and the parameters used in our calculation is @xmath42mev .",
    "consequently , we are only interested in the low - energy eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ hnw ] ) . to obtain these states ,",
    "we take advantage of the fact that the eigenproblem for @xmath12 can be solved analytically and notice that @xmath43 can be treated as a small perturbation .",
    "explicitly , the eigenstates of @xmath12 are @xmath44 where @xmath45 with @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is an eigenstate of the @xmath48 spin operator .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath49 where the chemical potential in the semiconductor @xmath7 is calculated from the bottom of the band .",
    "we project the quantum problem into the low - energy subspace spanned by the eigenstates @xmath50 with energies below a certain cutoff value , @xmath51 , where the cutoff energy @xmath52 is typically of the order @xmath53mev , i.e. , one order of magnitude larger than the inter sub  band spacing .",

    "@xcite in the simplest case of a single sub - band nanowire , this can be achieved with the help of a zeeman field ( _ i.e. _ a spin splitting ) @xmath58 which opens a gap at small momenta and removes one of the helicities that characterize the spectrum of a rashba - coupled electron system . in the multi - band nanowires",
    "the situation is more complicated ( see below ) but the zeeman term is essential to avoid fermion doubling . the zeeman term can be obtained using an external magnetic field applied along the @xmath59 axis , @xmath60 .",
    "when the chemical potential lies within one of the zeeman gaps at @xmath61 , the condition for odd sub  band occupation is satisfied and thus fermion doubling is avoided , which allows for the existence of majorana modes at the ends of the nanowire . note that in sm with a large g - factor , e.g. , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , relatively small in - plane magnetic fields can open a sizable gap without significantly perturbing superconductivity",
    "this is a crucial ingredient of the present proposal which is particularly important in the context of the effect of disorder on the topological phase as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : disorder ] .",

    "in addition to affecting the proximity - induced sc gap , the repulsive coulomb interactions among the sm electrons lead to an effective enhancement of the zeeman splitting which might be favorable for inducing topological superconductivity  @xcite .    thus , the total hamiltonian for our model of semiconductor / superconductor heterostructure is given by @xmath71 where the tunneling term reads @xmath72 ,     \\label{hnwsc}\\ ] ] with @xmath73 and @xmath74 being electron destruction operators acting within the sm and sc , respectively .",

    "note that the closing of the gap in the critical region between the trivial sc phase and the topological sc phase can be clearly observed . in this region",

    "the majorana bound state at @xmath544 is clearly marked by a sharp peak at @xmath545 , separated by a gap from other finite energy features .",
    "we conclude that measuring the tunneling differential conductance can provide a clear and unambiguous probe for majorana bound states in semiconductor nanowires .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a comprehensive theory for the realization and the observation of the emergent non - abelian majorana mode in semiconductor ( e.g. , inas , insb ) nanowires proximity coupled to an ordinary s  wave superconductor ( e.g. , al , nb ) in the presence of a zeeman splitting induced by an external magnetic field .",
    "the importance of our work lies in the thorough investigation of the experimental parameter space , which is required in order to predict the optimal parameter regime to search for the majorana mode in nanowires .",
    "since the number of possible physical parameters in the problem is large ( e.g. , electron density in the nanowire , geometric size of the wire , chemical potential , the strength of spin - orbit coupling , the superconducting gap , the hopping matrix elements between the semiconductor and the superconductor , the strengths of various disorder in the semiconductor , or in the superconductor , or at the interface between them ) , theoretical guidance , as provided in this work , is highly desirable for the success of the experimental search for the majorana fermion in solid  state systems . aside from the obvious conclusions ( e.g. ,",
    "strong spin - orbit coupling and large lande @xmath1-factor in the semiconductor , large superconducting gap in the superconductor , and low disorder everywhere stabilize the topological phase ) , we have discovered several unexpected results . in particular , we find somewhat surprisingly that the strict one - dimensional limit with purely one  subband occupancy for the nanowire , as originally envisioned by kitaev  @xcite and later used by many researchers  @xcite , is not only unnecessary , but is in fact detrimental to creating majorana modes . in the presence of disorder",
    ", the optimal system should have a few ( 3 - 5 ) occupied subbands in the nanowire for the creation of the majorana modes with maximal stability .",
    "this is , of course , great news from the experimental perspective , because fabricating strictly 1d semiconductor nanowires with pure one subband occupancy is a challenging task .",
    "another important result of our analysis is the relative immunity of the majorana modes to the presence of disorder in the system .",
    "the most dangerous disorder mechanisms are due to charged impurity centers in the semiconductor and to inhomogeneous hopping across the semiconductor - superconductor interface .",
    "our work suggests that the optimal nanowires for observing the majorana mode should not only have as little charge impurity disorder as possible in the semiconductor , but they should also have a thin insulating layer separating the semiconductor and superconductor ( so that the tunneling across the interface is not too strong ) , as well as some non  uniformity in the tunneling amplitude between the semiconductor and the superconductor across the width ( but not the length ) of the nanowire .",
    "our detailed numerical calculations establish that the zero  energy majorana modes should clearly show up in experiments , even in the presence of considerable disorder in the nanowires .",
    "in addition , we establish that the disorder in the superconductor has little effect on the majorana mode in the nanowire .",
    "another salient aspect of our work is the detailed calculation of the expected tunneling spectroscopy spectra for observing the majorana mode in the nanowire using realistic physical parameters .",
    "our results establish that the predicted topological quantum phase transition between the trivial phase with no majorana mode to the topological phase with a well - defined zero energy majorana bound state should be clearly observable as a striking zero - bias anomaly in the tunneling current when the zeeman splitting is tuned through the quantum critical point separating the two phases .",
    "more importantly , we calculate realistic tunneling spectra in the presence of uncontrolled spurious bound states in the system which are invariably present in real samples due to the localized random impurities in the semiconductor environment , clearly showing how to discern the topological features associated with the majorana bound states from the background of contributions due to trivial bound states caused by impurities in the system .",
    "our work emphasizes the tunneling measurements , which would directly establish the existence of a robust zero energy mode in the system , providing the necessary condition for the existence of the majorana fermion .",
    "what we have done here is to develop a detailed theory for the existence of a topological phase in the semiconductor - superconductor heterostructure , by taking into account essentially all of the relevant physical effects .",
    "once the presence of a robust zero energy mode is established , hence the necessary condition for the existence of the majorana is realized , one must move on to establish the sufficient condition , which would obviously be a harder task .",
    "several ideas for establishing definitively the existence of the majorana mode ( and its non - abelian braiding statistics nature ) have already been suggested in the literature , including experiments involving the fractional josephson effect  @xcite , the quantized differential conductance  @xcite , and majorana interferometry  @xcite .",
    "our work establishes the realistic likelihood of the existence within laboratory conditions of the non - abelian majorana zero  energy mode in spin ",
    "orbit interacting semiconductor nanowires proximity  coupled to ordinary superconductors .",
    "we also establish that tunneling spectroscopy is one of the easiest techniques to directly observe the elusive majorana in realistic solid  state systems .",
    "greater challenges , such as carrying out topological quantum computation , lie ahead once the laboratory existence of the majorana mode is established experimentally .",
