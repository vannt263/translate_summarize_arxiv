    "accurate knowledge of elemental abundances is of fundamental importance for many astrophysical processes . in soft x - rays from hot , low - density plasmas ( @xmath7@xmath8 , or @xmath9@xmath10 ; @xmath11@xmath12 ; @xmath13 ) in collisional ionization equilibrium , emission processes are relatively simple in that every collisional excitation results in a radiative transition whose photon escapes the plasma . at coronal temperatures ,",
    "ions are highly charged and the dominant species are typically h- and he - like ions .",
    "the abundant elements from c to fe have their principal h- and he - like lines in this band .",
    "hence , high - resolution x - ray spectra provide a wealth of emission lines from numerous abundant elements over a range of temperatures from a plasma which is relatively easily modeled .",
    "the solar corona and coronae of other stars still have some unexplained properties related to their elemental abundances , and these , in turn , relate to the formation of coronae and their use as diagnostics of stellar abundances .",
    "it has been known for quite some time that there is a correlation of solar coronal abundances with the elements first ionization potentials ( fip ) in the sense that elements with low fip ( @xmath14 ) are enhanced by up to a factor of 4 over photospheric values @xcite .    in other stars",
    ", coronal abundance anomalies were suspected even with low - resolution _ asca _ spectra @xcite , but there the low - fip elements were depleted relative to solar photospheric values ( termed an inverse fip effect ) . with the advent of high - resolution spectroscopy with the _ chandra_x - ray observatory ( cxo ) and _ xmm - newton_grating instruments nearly a decade ago , these results were confirmed in detail @xcite .",
    "the stellar observations have several difficulties in interpretation and in direct comparison to the sun .",
    "the photospheric abundances are often unknown , so the comparison is done against solar values .",
    "the stellar disks are unresolved ; we do not know whether particular structures , such as actively flaring regions or quiescent loops , dominate the emission , nor how extended are such structures .",
    "since flares in the sun  and presumably other stars  heat and evaporate chromospheric plasmas , it has been suggested that the flare matter would more likely represent the underlying photospheric plasma , since purported diffusion processes sensitive to the fip have had no time to have effect .",
    "observational results have been mixed .",

    "@xcite examined the fip effect in m - dwarfs and found that both high and low activity stars can have an inverse fip effect .",
    "they suggested that there is a trend with spectral type and that stars of type k are unbiased , earlier types have a fip effect , and later types have an inverse fip effect .",

    "calculations of fractionation amounts with model loops having typical parameters are similar to those observed .",
    "the determination of abundances from x - ray spectra can have far - reaching implications .",
    "@xcite used the rather uniform values of the ne : o abundance ratio in many stars to argue that these elements do not undergo differential fractionation , but represent the cosmic abundance ratio , and so adoption of this ratio for the sun would reconcile a rather serious conflict with stellar interior models and helioseismology .    here",

    "to compare @xmath0gemand hr@xmath1to the sun , we use a high - resolution x - ray spectrum from the _ coronas - f _ resik instrument of a solar flare on 2002 december 26 , in which the high - temperature plasmas reach the mid - range of temperatures found in the stellar spectra whose emissions are also probably due , in large part , to stellar flares , as we will show for @xmath0gemhere , and as has been shown for hr@xmath1 by @xcite .",

    "these two objects have the highest fluence exposures among hot , coronally active stars observed with the hetgs ; there are about 350,000 counts for each star in the combined first orders over the @xmath19@xmath20 range covered by both megand heg .",
    "the only other similar source with more counts is capella ( a calibration object ) having 20 hetgsexposures for nearly 800,000 counts .",

    "the default binning was adopted , which over - samples the instrumental resolution by about a factor of 4 .",
    "the counts spectra are thus composed of 4 orders per source per observation : the @xmath32 orders for each grating type , the megand heg , which have different efficiencies and resolving powers .",
    "several calibration files are required for analysis to convolve a model flux spectrum with the instrumental response in order to produce model counts .",
    "these are made for each observation and each spectral order by the ciaoprograms which use observation - specific data in conjunction with the calibration files to make the effective area files ( `` auxiliary response file '' , or arf ) and the spectral redistribution and extraction - aperture efficiency files ( `` response matrix file '' , or rmf ) @xcite .",

    "resik ( rentgenovsky spekrometr s izognutymi kristalami ) was a bent crystal spectrometer on the russian _ coronas - f _ spacecraft viewing solar active regions and flares , and was operational between 2001 and 2003 .",
    "the instrument consisted of a pair of si ( crystal plane 111 ) crystals and a pair of quartz ( @xmath33 ) crystals , with a one - dimensional position - sensitive proportional counter for each crystal pair .",
    "the combination of bent crystals and position - sensitive detector enables the entire spectral range to be observed simultaneously within a data - gathering interval .",
    "the duration of these intervals varied inversely with the amount of incident x - ray emission , typical values being @xmath34s for flare peaks and up to five minutes for times late in a flare decay .",
    "the wavelength ranges of the four channels for on - axis sources were 3.40@xmath35 ( channel 1 ) , 3.83@xmath36 ( 2 ) , 4.35@xmath37 ( 3 ) , and 5.00@xmath38 ( 4 ) .",
    "the lack of a collimator allowed resik to observe off - axis flares , extending the wavelength limits in one direction or the other by up to @xmath39 .",
    "the low atomic number of the crystal material ensured a much lower background due to crystal fluorescence ( which depends on @xmath40 ) than previous solar crystal spectrometers , enabling the solar continuum to be measured for at least the two shorter - wavelength channels . the total wavelength range ( 3.4@xmath38 ) included resonance lines of he - like k ( k  ) , h - like and he - like ar ( ar  , ar  ) , he - like cl ( cl  ) , h - like and he - like s ( s  , s  ) , and h - like and he - like si ( si  , si  ) . the wavelength resolution ( fwhm ) varied from @xmath41 ( near @xmath42 ) to @xmath43 ( near @xmath22 ) .",
    "resik was unable to resolve thermal doppler broadening for typical flare temperatures .",
    "thus , for a temperature of @xmath44 the thermal doppler broadening ( fwhm ) of the k   resonance line at @xmath45 is @xmath46 , and for the si   line at @xmath47 it is @xmath48 .",
    "further instrumental details about resik are given by @xcite .",
    "the resik spectra thus cover a much more limited wavelength region than the chandra / hetg spectra but the high quality of the absolute calibration allow a detailed comparison of the abundances of si , s , ar , and k in particular . in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : threespec ]",
    "we show a resik spectrum taken over a data - gathering interval of @xmath49s during the rise phase of a goes class  c1.9 flare on 2002 december 26 at 06:30  ut ( maximum ) .",
    "identifications of some of the principal emission lines are given .",
    "the analysis of the hetgspectra required an iterative combination of global plasma model fits , parametric line fitting , and line - based reconstruction of the emission measure distribution ( emd ) and elemental abundances .",
    "the first step was to fit a plasma model to the binned spectrum in order to provide a physically - based continuum for parametric line fitting . even at hegresolution ( @xmath50 )",
    ", there are regions of the spectrum for which the apparent continuum is above the true value due to line blending .",
    "the continuum originates from free - free ( ff ) and free - bound ( fb ) components , and the latter depends significantly upon elemental abundances , especially for solar flares @xcite ; for the stars with high temperatures and low metallicity , ff emission dominates the continuum .",
    "the line emissivities , more generally called @xmath51 functions ( in which @xmath52 is the plasma s electron temperature ) , are defined by the amount of radiation emitted by an optically thin plasma per second with unit volume emission measure ( @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the electron density , @xmath55 the proton density , and @xmath56 the emitting volume ) . in terms of plasma and atomic quantities ,",

    "the line luminosity is related to @xmath66 through an integral over the emission measure , which , through a change of variables , is expressed as a differential in electron temperature instead of volume : @xmath67\\ ,                   \\mathrm{d}\\log t_e }                       \\quad\\mathrm{[phot\\,s{^{-1}}]}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath60 and @xmath61 identify the transition and ion , as in the expression for @xmath51 ) .",
    "the quantity in square brackets is called the differential emission measure .",
    "when we refer to the emission measure distribution ( emd ) it will be this quantity integrated over intervals of @xmath68 _ vs. _  temperature ( for historical examples , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the plasma models describing the hetgspectra , we relied on the output of the astrophysical plasma emission code ( apec ) , as available in the atomic database , atomdb @xcite , which provided continuum and line emissivities for low - density plasmas in collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "we adopted the defaults for ionization balance @xcite and solar photospheric abundances @xcite ( though abundances were free parameters and referenced to more recent determinations later ) .",
    "the initial fit used a broken powerlaw model for the emission measure temperature distribution with variable abundances for the most abundant elements with strong emission line features in the hetgspectrum ( e.g. , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe ) .",
    "this model allowed a range of temperatures as required for multi - thermal plasmas . including lines provided strong constraints on dominant temperatures , but the `` abundances '' were here solely parameters , since the line flux , continuum flux , and abundances are degenerate to a large degree .",
    "the result is a semi - empirical plasma model which follows the observed continuum .    given a continuum model , we then parametrically fit a large number of lines ( in small groups ) as a sum of the plasma continuum and gaussian line profiles .",
    "the free parameters were the line wavelengths and fluxes .",
    "since the lines are unresolved ( the thermal broadening being below instrumental resolution , and with no detection of other broadening , such as due to turbulence , rotational , or from binary motions ) , intrinsic widths were typically frozen at a small value ( e.g. , @xmath69 ) .",
    "the only exception was for the ly-@xmath70 lines of h - like ions which are marginally resolved doublets ; and allowing the width to be free was sufficient for an accurate determination of line flux . for regions with heavily blended lines , constraints on line separations",
    "were sometimes imposed if the features were well identified ( e.g. , ne   lyman series at @xmath71@xmath72 blending with the mg   triplet at @xmath73 ) .",
    "each line fit had a candidate identification with a transition in atomdb , based on prior experience with similar spectra ( for example , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or if it is unknown or an unresolved blend , it may have been fit solely to remove it from an overlapping feature of interest .",
    "lines with large absolute wavelength residuals relative to the atomdb identification were flagged as probable mis - identifications and excluded from further analysis .",
    "we give the line measurements for @xmath0gemand hr@xmath1 in tables  [ tbl : sgemlines][tbl : hrtenlines ] .",
    "the resulting list of lines and fluxes were then used to perform a simultaneous determination of the emd and elemental abundances .",
    "this was done by minimizing the residuals of model and measured fluxes against a smoothness constraint on the emd , using the emissivities _ vs. _  temperature taken from atomdb for each line .",
    "the free parameters were the emd weights in each of 26 logarithmically spaced temperature bins which spanned the sensitivity range of the lines , and the relative abundances .",
    "we started with a flat emd and constant abundances .",
    "the constraint was cast in the form of a penalty function proportional to the summed squared second derivative of the emd , and by fitting the logarithm of the emd to enforce positivity .",
    "figure  [ fig : linetemps ] shows the temperature regime covered by lines in the hetgbandpass ( @xmath74@xmath5 ) , spanning @xmath74@xmath75 . since the continuum emissivity was not included explicitly in this procedure , the resulting abundance and emd normalizations are degenerate , requiring a good starting point , and a post facto evaluation of the binned spectrum to evaluate the continuum level .",
    "we performed an iteration in which we derived the emd and abundances , evaluated the model spectrum , scaled the overall emd normalization and abundances inversely , and repeated the reconstruction until converged . in ",
    "[ app : ratioresids ] , we show the line flux residuals against different parameters to demonstrate the quality of the solutions",
    ". ratios of observed to theoretical fluxes within a factor of 2 are typical of such reconstructions ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "we tested the emd / abundance reconstruction method by fitting spectra simulated with sums of 13 broken powerlaw emds ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "we used different shapes for the input emd , from single , narrow peaks , to 23 peaks of different widths , positions , and weights .",
    "the results showed that small wiggles in the emd ( of order 10% ) were artifacts , that the emd peak temperatures could be determined to about 0.1 dex , that abundances could be determined to about 10% accuracy for strong - lined ions ( in this self - consistent treatment of the method ) , and finally that the weak line features should have their abundances fitted post facto using the emd solution .",
    "the simulations also allowed us to tune the smoothness constraint , since if it was too small , much jagged structure appeared in the solution .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : emd ] gives a detailed view of the @xmath0gemand hr@xmath1emds .",
    "values plotted are the emission measure integrated over 0.1 dex temperature bins .",
    "the dip in both curves at just above @xmath77 is probably a reconstruction artifact , as are wiggles on the low - temperature tail .",
    "the large peak at about @xmath78 in the @xmath0gemsolution , however , is required by the spectrum ( and actually required a slightly more relaxed emd smoothness constraint than for hr@xmath1to give a good match to the model spectrum ) .",
    "after we obtained a solution , we then ran several ( @xmath79100 ) monte - carlo iterations in which we perturbed the line fluxes by their uncertainties and then re - computed the emission measure distribution and abundances .",
    "this provided some idea of the uncertainty in the solution due to counting statistics .",
    "the @xmath80 envelopes are shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : emd ] , though these do not represent independent errors .",
    "the uncertainties from counting statistics are relatively small . especially for the abundances ( see figure  [ fig : abunds ] ) , they are generally less than systematic uncertainties expected from the underlying atomic data .    for lines too weak or too few to include in the emd reconstruction , we did post facto fits of their abundances by adopting the emd as a frozen quantity , then fitted only the relevant abundance in narrow regions of the binned spectrum including the lines of interest .",
    "we did such for k  , na  , and al  .",
    "abundance values are given in table  [ tbl : abund ] .",
    "we have also listed the monte - carlo determined statistical uncertainties , even if unrealistically small .",

    "scaling their emission measure up by a factor of 8 and their abundances scaled down by a factor of 2.5 provides a reasonable match to observed counts above @xmath109 , but is very poor at shorter wavelengths ; this is probably due to their sharp cutoff in the emd above @xmath110 .",
    "@xcite analyzed flares in several stars , including @xmath0gemand hr@xmath1 , using both _ xmm - newton_and _ chandra_spectra .",
    "the _ xmm - newton_spectra do not provide high resolution data at the short wavelengths of interest here ; they relied on ccd resolution for lines of s , ar , and ca .",
    "since the _ xmm - newton_observation of @xmath0gemwas entirely of a flare state , they used the hetg  @xmath0gemobservation to represent its quiescent state .",

    "we have somewhat discrepant results : while our values for @xmath114 , the x - ray luminosity over the @xmath15@xmath115 band , are of the same order ( @xmath116 ) , our integrated emission measure ( @xmath117 ; see table  [ tbl : stars ] ) is about 5 times larger .",

    "our estimate of the @xmath117 appears robust , being obtained even if fitting a single temperature plasma with uniformly variable abundances to a single order of one observation  the lines match poorly overall , but the continuum is a fair match and largely specifies the @xmath117 .",
    "the factor of 5 difference is likely due to the abundances used .",
    "the line luminosity is degenerate in abundance and emission measure which enter as a product ( see equations  [ eqn : gt ] and  [ eqn : emd ] ) .",
    "@xcite were interested in abundances changes , and did not determine the fe abundance . hence ,",
    "if one adopts an iron abundance 20% of solar in their analysis , their @xmath117 would be 5 times larger .",
    "another case , which at first appears discrepant , actually agrees for the same reason .",
    "@xcite derived the emd for @xmath0gemand hr@xmath1from uv emission lines .",
    "they also assumed solar abundances , and have a @xmath117 about 5 times lower than our determination .",
    "if we use our model to predict the @xmath118 fe - blend flux , we obtain values within a factor of 2 of their measurements . if we use their model to evaluate the fe   @xmath119 flux , we get essentially the same as our measurement .",
    "given that the stars are variable , we have very good agreement with the uv results .    in sum , we believe our models improve on  in a global and absolute sense  prior works    which dealt with ratios , limited spectral ranges , or low resolution .",
    "our detailed modeling is especially important for determining reliable values for some of the weak emission lines from low fip elements , where the multi - thermal continuum model can be very important .",
    "the origin of the values of elemental abundances in solar and stellar coronae is an unsolved problem .",
    "it is an important one because the differences in abundances from the underlying photosphere could provide information on the coronal structure , such as loop geometry or alfvn wave frequency and amplitude , e.g. , under the ponderomotive fractionation theory of @xcite . or",
    "if the relation between coronal and photospheric abundances were known , then x - ray spectra would be very valuable in determining abundances in star - forming regions where stars are deeply embedded and not visible in other wavelength bands .",
    "the x - ray spectral modeling is fairly simple ; the spectra are amenable to determination of absolute abundances , especially in the short wavelength region where the continuum is dominated by a single temperature , and the line - to - continuum ratio is directly proportional to the elemental abundance . at about @xmath77 ,",
    "the continuum flux at @xmath120 is about 10% that at @xmath22 , but becomes comparable by about @xmath112 . our model for @xmath0gemshows that below @xmath22 the primary contribution is from plasmas with @xmath121 , and @xmath122 of the continuum",
    "is emitted by h and he thermal bremsstrahlung . above @xmath22 ,",
    "the continuum comes from plasmas with temperatures which differ by more than 0.3 dex  the typical width of a line emissivity or @xmath66 function  which means that a multi - thermal plasma model is required to interpret the line - to - continuum ratio in terms of an absolute abundance .",
    "hence , one must use all the lines available and perform emission measure and abundance reconstructions .",
    "the region below @xmath22 fortunately contains lines from abundant elements of both high and low fip , in particular k ( @xmath123 ; @xmath124 ) and ca ( @xmath29 , @xmath125 ; @xmath126 ) , and at the other extreme , ar ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 ; @xmath129 ) .",

    "such was possible using the resik instrument for the sun , and the _ chandra_/hetgsfor stars . in order to obtain results for the lowest fip element present ( k )",

    ", we used a solar flare spectrum so that it has plasma at comparable temperatures to the stars .    as a secondary goal , the richness of the hetgsspectra allowed determination of elemental abundances for other low fip species , namely na , al , and ca , which had not before been measured in detail , as well as measurements for the high - fip elements , o , n , and",
    "ne .    determination of the stellar abundances from the broader hetgsspectrum necessarily required a full emission measure solution , since emission measure and abundance appear as a factor in line flux formation , and because the continuum beyond about @xmath22 has significant contributions from a broad range of temperatures .",
    "these details must be considered carefully when attempting comparisions to other work .",
    "hence , we have determined new elemental abundances for the lowest fip species  particularly k and na , but also ca and al  in two stellar coronal sources with very hot , flaring plasmas . while the abundance of k ( having the lowest fip ) in @xmath0gemis similar to that in the solar corona , other low - fip elements ( na , al , ca , mg , fe , and si ) are strongly depleted , only becoming near or above solar for the high fip elements n , ar , and ne .",
    "even the stellar s abundances ( considered high - fip ) has a very low relative abundance .    except for k ,",
    "for which we only have an upper - limit in hr@xmath1 , the two stellar elemental abundance distributions are remarkably similar to each other , despite differences in their rotational periods ( @xmath151 and @xmath152 for hr@xmath1and @xmath0gem , respectively ) and luminosity classes .    the solar flare plasma , which reaches stellar coronal temperatures of @xmath153 , shows low - fip elements of k and fe to be typical of the solar corona ( that is , enhanced relative to photospheric values ) , while si and s are photospheric or lower , but still above the stellar values .",
    "the abundances of ar is similar in the solar and stellar flares .",
    "the overall trend with fip is similar to , but less extreme than the stellar case , with the exception of fe having high relative abundance , though it has about the same fip as si .",
    "both the stellar and solar cases show abundance trends more complicated than simple fip or `` inverse''-fip during flares .",
    "whether other active stars have similar patterns at the lowest fip would require investment of @xmath154-@xmath155 per star to raise some of the existing lower fluence hetgsobservations of coronal sources to comparable levels .",

    "figure  [ fig : lineratioresids ] shows in detail the line flux ratio residuals ( model to data ) against wavelength , temperature , and line flux . features with ratios roughly between 0.5 and 2.0 were used in the emission measure modeling .",
    "we include some of the weaker lines ( such as of k , na , and al ) which were not used , but were later fit for abundances post facto using the emission measure solution .",
    "the figures show that there are a significant number of lines spanning the wavelength and temperature ranges , and of significant quality for emission measure modeling .",
    "a small bias can be seen in that residuals are slightly more likely to be high than low .",
    "this is more clearly seen in the histogram of the residuals in figure  [ fig : residhist ] .",
    "there is a tail above a ratio of 1.4 , and it is similar in both stars .",
    "looking at the lower panel of figure  [ fig : lineratioresids ] we can see that this bias is more prevalent in the weaker lines .",
    "hence , we believe it is due to inclusion of unresolved blends in the measured flux which are not accounted for in the model flux . a systematically low continuum would also produce high residuals , but the flat residuals seen in figures  [ fig : threespec ] , [ fig : kregdetail ] , [ fig : naregdetail ] and  [ fig : siggemspec ] argue against that explanation , as do other well modeled weak lines .",
