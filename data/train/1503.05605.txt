    "recently , a great deal of theoretical attention has been devoted to the accurate determination of the shear - viscosity - to - entropy - density ratio ( @xmath0 ) of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) , and how its temperature dependence around the transition point between these two phases might be probed in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in particular , a recent study @xcite suggested the possibility of discriminating experimentally between different parametrizations of the temperature dependence of @xmath0 using systematic analyses of the anisotropic flows @xmath1 and @xmath2 as functions of transverse momentum @xmath3 and pseudorapidity @xmath4 . in this paper , we present a complementary analysis of the hbt radii for au+au collisions at rhic energies , to argue that the hbt radii can be used profitably to help constrain viable parametrizations of @xmath5 .",
    "the hbt radii are physical observables which are well defined on an event - by - event basis . as parameters that describe the size and shape of the particle emitting source ,",
    "they fluctuate from event to event .",
    "experimental data so far @xcite determine only the average source radii characterizing a large ensemble of events @xcite . elsewhere",
    "@xcite we discuss new ideas of how to complement such measurements of the ensemble - averaged hbt radii by a determination of their variances , i.e. , the width parameters characterizing their event - by - event fluctuations . in that work",
    "@xcite it is also shown that the experimentally accessible observables characterizing the mean source radii and their variances clearly track the algebraic mean and variance of the source radii that are calculated theoretically from the individual emission functions of a large set of dynamically simulated heavy - ion collisions with fluctuating initial conditions .",
    "we here show the transverse pair momentum ( @xmath6 ) dependencies of these mean radii and their variances for the same four parametrizations of the specific shear viscosity @xmath0 studied in @xcite .",
    "we also compare the mean radii to those one would obtain from a single average source by dynamically evolving a single initial profile , constructed as the ensemble average of the fluctuating initial conditions of the full ensemble .    to save time and effort , we employ for this pioneering study the shortcut of calculating the hbt radii from the source variances of the emission function @xcite for directly emitted pions only , instead of performing a 3-d gaussian fit to the correlation function including all resonance decays @xcite .",
    "this approximation , which holds exactly only for gaussian sources @xcite , is known to be sufficient to discern qualitative features of the hbt radii and their @xmath7 dependences , although it is not accurate enough for quantitative comparisons with experimental data @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we compute the hbt radii , as outlined in the previous section , for central ( 0 - 10% ) au+au collisions at 200@xmath8gev , based on charged pion correlations .",

    "this effect is especially severe for the parametrizations lh - hq and hh - hq where at early times , when the longitudinal - transverse velocity shear is biggest , @xmath24 is very large . to compensate for this effect , we rescale our initial entropy profiles by a constant factor @xmath25 , which depends on the chosen parametrization of @xmath24 . for a given choice of @xmath24 , @xmath25",

    "three - dimensional experimental hbt analyses , therefore , exclusively report measurements based on large collections of events , rather than measurements of event - by - event hbt radii . in order to obtain an apples - to - apples comparison with experimental data , theoretical hbt calculations must therefore , at some level , average over all events in the ensemble .",
    "this procedure , known as _ ensemble averaging _ , can be performed in several ways , two of which we consider here . according to one prescription ,",
    "the initial conditions for all events in the ensemble are averaged _ before _ their hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "we refer to this method of ensemble averaging as `` single - shot hydrodynamics '' ( ssh ) @xcite . for a sufficiently large ensemble , averaging over many , individually fluctuating and bumpy initial conditions results in a _ smooth _ initial transverse entropy density profile , which in turn may be evolved hydrodynamically as a single , averaged event .",
    "this prescription eliminates any sensitivity to event - by - event fluctuations in the initial state .",
    "we will here denote the hbt radii derived from single - shot hydrodynamics by @xmath46 .",
    "an alternative prescription for computing the ensemble - averaged hbt radii evolves each fluctuating event _ independently _ and averages over the entire ensemble only _",
    "after _ the hbt radii have been computed for each event from its individual hydrodynamic emission function @xmath47 .",
    "this leads to the following definition of ensemble - averaged hbt radii : @xmath48 we denote by @xmath49 the hbt radii of the @xmath50th event , and we label the mean hbt radii computed according to this `` direct ensemble average '' ( dea ) by @xmath51 .",
    "the basic formalism describing our calculation of the hbt radii was presented in @xcite .",

    "the dependence of the hbt radii on the pair emission angle @xmath62 also allows them to be expanded in a fourier series ( we suppress the additional dependence of all hbt parameters on @xmath7 and @xmath63 ) , @xmath64 , \\label{r2ij_ft_defn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the flow - plane angle @xmath65 is defined by the complex phase of the @xmath66th - order anisotropic flow coefficient @xmath67 @xcite : @xmath68 in this work , we average @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 over @xmath62 , but we report the 2nd @xmath62-harmonic @xmath72 of the out - side cross - term @xmath73 , since the mean value of its @xmath62-average @xmath74 vanishes for symmetric nucleus - nucleus collisions at midrapidity @xcite . for single events with fluctuating initial conditions , @xmath72 receives non - zero contributions from both @xmath75 and @xmath76 on an event - by - event basis , but the former contribution averages to zero for a sufficiently large ensemble . we therefore consider only the mean and variance of the event - wise fluctuations of @xmath77 for the remainder of this paper . for notational simplicity , we will drop the 0 subscript from the azimuthally averaged radii , and write simply @xmath78 .    at @xmath61 , eq .",

    "the sensitivity to @xmath35 at freeze - out of the hbt radii probing the outward and longitudinal dimensions of the emission function ( panels ( b , c ) ) is negligible .",

    "however , @xmath24 affects hadronic observables in two distinct ways .",
    "first , there is the cumulative dynamical effect of shear viscosity on the development of flow in the fireball ; flow probes the entire temperature history of @xmath24 between the initial and decoupling temperatures .",
    "second , the emission function is affected by the viscous correction @xmath35 to the distribution function at freeze - out , eq .",

    "this gives a contribution to observables such as the hbt radii that depends exclusively on the behavior of @xmath24 at @xmath94 and is basically independent of its prior history ( except for the accumulated effect of @xmath24 on the flow pattern whose associated shear tensor also affects the shear stress at freeze - out ) .",

    "additionally , both of these studies extract the hbt radii from a gaussian fit to the full three - dimensional correlation function instead of using the short - cut through the source variances .",

    "the purpose of the present work is not a realistic comparison with experimental data which , as done in @xcite , would require a simultaneous tuning of several additional parameters ( see also ref .",

    "there is little to no effect on either from variations in the behavior of @xmath24 in the hadronic phase below @xmath90 , except for the sideward and out - side radius parameters @xmath103 and @xmath72 and the sideward variance @xmath131 which all show significant sensitivity to the viscous @xmath35 correction at freeze - out .",
    "the latter , in turn , depends on the value of @xmath0 at the freeze - out temperature but not on its prior dynamical evolution in the hadronic phase .",
    "since the @xmath35 correction is not theoretically well constrained at the present moment , this sensitivity of @xmath69 and @xmath72 to @xmath0 at freeze - out should be viewed with some caution .    , but without the viscous correction @xmath35 to the freeze - out distribution function .",
    "one sees that for the normalized width of the distribution of sideward radii @xmath103 , deleting @xmath35 removes all sensitivity to the temperature dependence of @xmath0 in the hadronic phase , while all other normalized widths are only weakly affected by @xmath35 .",
    "[ f10 ] ]    the levels of sensitivity of the hbt radii and their variances to the temperature dependence of @xmath0 observed here are comparable to those observed in ref .",
