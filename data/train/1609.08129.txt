    "although the standard model ( sm ) is in agreement with the observed properties of the charged fermions , it is unlikely to be the ultimate theory . from the experimental point of view",
    ", we can mention at least three evidences which are hints that there must be physics beyond the sm : i ) the nonzero neutrino masses  @xcite . in the sm the neutrinos are massless to all orders in perturbation theory , and non - perturbative effects are negligible ;",
    "ii ) the strength of cp violation in the sm , through the single phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix , is not able to generate the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe  @xcite ; iii ) the existence of dark matter ( dm )  @xcite , in the sm there is no such a candidate to explain this issue .",
    "one of the most popular extensions of the sm is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is usual in the mssm framework to introduce @xmath5-parity in order to forbid baryon and lepton number violating interactions avoiding proton decay and processes like @xmath6 .",
    "when the model satisfies the @xmath5-parity the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable and , therefore , it is a candidate to be the dark matter in the universe @xcite .",
    "however , in this model neutrinos are massless . if we want to generate masses to them we need to break the @xmath5-parity generating violation of the lepton number @xmath3 , but baryon number @xmath2 is still conserved , so that the proton remains stable and at least one neutrino gets mass at the tree level @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mssm contains new cp - violating sources beyond the ckm matrix  @xcite .",
    "therefore , mechanisms for generating leptogenesis  @xcite are natural in supersymmetric models .",
    "it is a well known fact that in the context of the sm ( no right - handed neutrinos ) both , baryon and lepton numbers , are conserved automatically .",
    "however , both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are anomalous  @xcite ( but their consequences are well suppressed , at least at zero temperature ) and only the combination @xmath9 is anomaly free . when the @xmath10 symmetry is gauged , it becomes anomaly free but only if an appropriate number of right handed neutrinos is added , for instance , one per family .",
    "when we consider the @xmath4 symmetry as a local symmetry it appears a lot of new kind of models , for instance , the left - right symmetric models  @xcite .",
    "both neutrino masses and the baryon asymmetry problems can be readily solved if right - handed neutrinos are introduced .",
    "once right - handed neutrinos are introduced the baryon number minus lepton number , i.e. , the @xmath4 quantum number can be related to a local @xmath11 gauge symmetry .",
    "a possibility is to add an extra @xmath11 factor to the sm gauge symmetry , denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "the symmetry at high energy is @xmath13 , and @xmath14 after the symmetry is broken at the tev scale  @xcite .    if we consider @xmath9 as an additional gauge symmetry we can introduce a term like @xmath15 if @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the right - handed neutrinos , and a majorana mass term is induced to the neutrinos if @xmath18 .",
    "if this term is not present , there is a fine tuning in the dirac neutrino mass , i.e. , the respective yukawa couplings are severely constrained , @xmath19 , in order to explain the neutrino masses , see for instance ref .",
    "the tev mass scale for right - handed neutrinos is naturally obtained in the supersymmetric @xmath4 extension of the sm .",
    "recently it was proposed a model in which @xmath10 is not just a new factor added to the sm gauge symmetry but @xmath20 in @xmath12 is substituted by @xmath21 and the breaking @xmath22 occurs at the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the number of right - handed neutrinos and their @xmath4 ( or @xmath1 ) quantum numbers are free parameters , but the cancellation of the cubic and the linear anomalies implies that at least three right - handed neutrinos must be added to the matter representation content of the sm .",
    "explicit solutions for the @xmath4 ( or @xmath1 ) parameters show that at least two types of model arise : i ) the model with three right - handed neutrinos having @xmath23 ; the model with two right - handed neutrinos having @xmath24 and the third one having @xmath25 . in models of the second type it is possible to generate dirac masses or the inverse seesaw mechanism for the active neutrinos  @xcite .",

    "we have considered a supersymmetric version of a model in which the @xmath20 factor in the sm is substituted by @xmath21 which is broken down to @xmath20 by non - trivial scalar singlets vevs at an energy scale higher than the electroweak scale  @xcite .",
    "we have introduced three right - handed neutrinos , with the same @xmath4 as the active neutrinos , that are sterile with respect to the sm interactions but are not sterile with respect to the @xmath245 and @xmath10 ones . charged lepton and neutrino masses",
    "are generated at the tree level . in the neutrino case",
    ", we have implemented a type - i seesaw mechanism .",
    "we also have shown the mass spectra of all the other fermions and scalars , and also of the gauge bosons .",
    "in particular we have shown that the lightest neutral scalar has a upper limit of 140 gev when radiative corrections are taken into account .",
    "the model has interesting feature such as i ) neutrinos do not mix with neutralinos , ii ) the conservation of the @xmath5-parity is related not to @xmath2 and @xmath3 conservation separately , but with the @xmath4 conservation ; and iii ) the model has several flat directions due to the existence of a gauge - invariant scalar combination of the right - handed sneutrinos , sleptons and one the higgs doublets .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that a model with a flat direction , as in eq .",
    "( [ flat1 ] ) , may unify inflation , dark matter and neutrino masses . however , the price to be paid is a fine tune in the yukawa sector @xmath246 .",
    "we will show elsewhere that our model has these features without resorting to a yukawa fine tuning  @xcite .",
