    "concentrated suspensions are important in many industrial applications such as drilling , water - coal slurries transport , food processing , cosmetics and ceramics manufacture . in nature",
    ", flows of concentrated suspensions appear as mud slides , lava flows and soils liquefied by the earthquake - induced vibrations ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "an asymptotic formula for the effective viscosity of a suspension of non - colloidal particles in a newtonian fluid , derived in @xcite , is based on the local lubrication analysis of the energy dissipation rate in the narrow gap between a pair of nearly touching particles .",
    "the distance between two neighboring particles in a periodic array is the small parameter in the problem . for periodic arrays , this _",
    "inter - particle distance _ is uniquely determined by the volume fraction of particles , so that the asymptotics of the effective viscosity is obtained as a function of the volume fraction @xmath3 that is close to the maximal packing volume fraction @xmath4 .",
    "the asymptotics of the effective viscosity obtained in @xcite has the form @xmath5 as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "the formulas for effective viscosity of periodic suspensions in the whole space @xmath8 ( without boundary ) subject to a prescribed linear flow , obtained in @xcite , also rely on the local lubrication analysis .",
    "asymptotic representations for the components of the effective viscosity tensor calculated by @xcite are of the form @xmath9 recently , concentrated random suspensions were investigated numerically by @xcite using accelerated stokesian dynamics .",
    "it was observed that the behaviour of the effective high frequency dynamic shear viscosity of disordered suspensions can be accurately described by the asymptotic @xmath10 , indicating degeneration of the leading term in the asymptotic expansions ( [ 001 ] ) ( weak blow up ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite also show that their results are in good agreement with available experimental data ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that for generic random suspensions , the asymptotics of the effective viscosity defined by the ( properly normalized ) global dissipation rate can not be identified with the local dissipation rate in a single gap .    in this paper , we use the discrete network approximation proposed in @xcite to study the asymptotics of the shear effective viscosity @xmath0 and the extensional effective viscosity @xmath1 corresponding to general disordered particle arrays . for such arrays ,",
    "the volume fraction alone is not sufficient for determining the effective viscosity .",
    "therefore , instead of @xmath11 , we use the inter - particle distance parameter @xmath2 that controls the distances @xmath12 between neighboring particles .    the mathematical construction of @xcite accounts for the long range hydrodynamical interactions between the particles , and provides an algorithm for calculation of the effective viscosity , which takes into account variable distances between neighboring particles in non - periodic arrays .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite it was observed that the leading term of the asymptotics may degenerate due to the external boundary conditions and geometry of the particle array , while in the scalar case ( @xcite ) the order of the leading term is the same for all particle arrays that form a connected network .",
    "this paper is devoted to a detailed study of this degeneration phenomenon .",
    "in particular , we clarify the issue of weak versus strong blow up in the asymptotics of the effective viscosity .",
    "the definition of the effective viscosity employed in this paper differs from the definition in @xcite .",
    "their definition is closely related to the definition of the effective material properties of periodic media in homogenization theory ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , where these properties are defined via analysis on a periodicity cell",
    ". then these properties are determined by the properties of constituents and geometry of the periodic array , independently of the external boundary conditions and applied forces .",
    "such properties are usually defined in the limit when particle size tends to zero while the number of particles approaches infinity .",
    "our definition is more directly linked to the viscometric measurements that necessarily involve boundary conditions .",
    "we assume that particles of a fixed size are placed in a bounded domain ( apparatus ) , and the typical distance between the neighboring particles approaches zero .",
    "thus , the total volume fraction of particles approaches the maximal packing fraction . in this case",
    "the effective viscosity will be influenced not just by the inter - particle interactions but also by the forces or velocities prescribed at the boundary of the apparatus .",
    "since we work with linear models , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) are independent of the applied shear ( extension ) rate .",
    "however , we also show that the asymptotic order of the effective viscosities depends on the relation between the orientation of the velocity prescribed at the boundary , shape of the boundary , and orientations of the line segments connecting pairs of neighboring particles",
    ".    we present sufficient conditions for degeneration ( weak blow up ) and non - degeneration ( strong blow up ) of the leading term .",
    "we show that @xmath0 always exhibits weak blow up , while local analysis alone predicts strong blow up .",
    "we also show that the asymptotic order of @xmath1 depends on the geometry of the particle array . in the paper",
    ", we define a broad class of arrays of particles for which the leading order term of @xmath1 does not degenerate .",
    "this situation is typical in the sense that for a generic array @xmath0 and @xmath1 have vastly different values , and their ratio depends on the inter - particle distance , which indicates possible non - newtonian behaviour of the effective fluid under the imposed boundary conditions .",
    "we also give an example of a closely packed particle array for which the leading term in the extensional viscosity degenerates .",
    "we consider a concentrated suspension of rigid , non - brownian , neutrally buoyant particles in a viscous incompressible newtonian fluid . in the two - dimensional model ,",
    "the suspension occupies a domain @xmath13 which is a square of side length two centered at the origin .",
    "the boundary of @xmath13 is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the upper and lower sides of @xmath15 are denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "we also let @xmath18 denote the cartesian basis vectors parallel to the sides of @xmath15 . the particles @xmath19 , @xmath20 are modelled as rigid disks with centers @xmath21 , placed in @xmath13 . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the monodisperse case , so that all particles have radius @xmath22 .",
    "the part of @xmath13 which is not occupied by particles is the fluid domain , denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "the fluid at low reynolds number is governed by stokes equations @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fluid viscosity , @xmath26 the velocity field , and @xmath27 is the pressure .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the external boundary conditions of the shear and extensional types .",
    "the shear type boundary conditions are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a constant shear rate .",
    "in the case of extensional boundary conditions the velocity is prescribed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a constant extension rate .",
    "the two remaining ( vertical ) sides of @xmath15 are free surfaces , where the zero traction condition is prescribed .",
    "to define particle velocities , we first recall that a rigid body moving in the plane defined by @xmath32 has a velocity vector of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane of motion . therefore , if @xmath35 , then @xmath36 . equation ( [ p - vel ] )",
    "shows that the velocity of a particle @xmath19 , @xmath20 is completely determined by two parameters : a constant translational velocity vector @xmath37 and a scalar angular velocity @xmath38 . both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are unknown and",
    "must be determined in the course of solving the problem .",
    "since each rigid disk is in equilibrium , the total force and torque exerted on @xmath19 by the fluid must be zero , which provides the boundary conditions on the particle boundaries @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the exterior unit normal to @xmath39 , and @xmath42 in ( [ def - stress ] ) and throughout the paper , @xmath43 denotes the strain rate tensor defined by @xmath44 the superscript @xmath45 stands for the transposed tensor , and @xmath46 denotes the unit tensor .    solving equation ( [ eq1 ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ shear - fbc ] ) ( or ( [ ext - fbc ] ) ) and ( [ p - bc ] ) is equivalent to minimizing the functional @xmath47 over the function space @xmath48 of admissible velocity fields @xmath49 .",
    "this space is a space of vector functions in @xmath13 satisfying either ( [ shear - fbc ] ) or ( [ ext - fbc ] ) , and such that @xmath50 since the fluid velocity @xmath26 is the minimizer of the variational principle ( [ primal])-([sp_u ] ) , the energy dissipation rate @xmath51 in the fluid ( defined in equation ( [ sus - dis ] below ) can be written as @xmath52    in next section we will see that calculation of the effective viscosities essentially amounts to calculation of @xmath51 .",
    "we suppose that the suspension can be modelled on a macroscale by a single phase viscous fluid , called an _",
    "effective fluid_. the velocity field of the effective fluid is denoted by @xmath53 .",
    "the effective fluid is subject to the same external boundary conditions as the flow of the suspension .",
    "we assume that the effective stress tensor @xmath54 satisfies the constitutive equation of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a symmetric tensor function that does not depend explicitly on @xmath57 . in this paper",
    ", we do not derive or postulate the precise from of the constitutive law for the effective fluid .",
    "instead , we use the fundamental principle ( going back to @xcite ) , that viscous energy dissipation rate of the suspension must be equal to the dissipation rate of the effective homogeneous fluid .",
    "the dissipation rates are defined by @xmath58 in the suspension , and @xmath59 in the effective fluid . in the equations ( [ sus - dis ] ) , ( [ eff - dis ] ) , @xmath60 is the inner product of tensors .    for small particle volume fractions , ( @xcite , @xcite ) ,",
    "this principle was further combined with the assumption that the effective fluid is newtonian with a constant effective viscosity . however , for concentrated suspensions this assumption is not validated by rigorous mathematical derivation or experimental data and at present the problem of finding the effective constitutive law for such suspensions is still under investigation .",
    "some experimental studies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) suggest that the effective fluid may be non - newtonian .",
    "our calculations of the effective viscosity suggest that non - newtonian behavior is possible for irregular ( non - periodic or random ) suspensions .",
    "we use the rheological definitions of shear and extensional viscosities as ratios of the corresponding components of the stress and strain rate tensors . to calculate the asymptotics of the two viscosities , we employ the network approximation introduced in ( @xcite ) .",
    "we analyze the network functional ( discrete dissipation rate ) introduced in @xcite and show that the standard relation between two viscosities which holds for newtonian fluids ( see @xcite ch . 9 for the 3d - case and appendix a for 2d - case ) does not hold .",
    "suppose that a homogeneous effective fluid undergoes a steady shear flow with the shear rate @xmath29 .",
    "the velocity field @xmath61 satisfies the shear type boundary conditions ( [ shear - fbc ] )",
    ". the effective shear viscosity is defined by ( see ( [ eo - shear ] ) ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the corresponding component of the effective stress tensor and @xmath64 .",
    "note that our definition of @xmath65 in ( [ const ] ) implies that @xmath66 is constant when @xmath67 is constant .",
    "since @xmath68 , the equivalent definition is @xmath69 thus the calculation of @xmath0 amounts to evaluation of the total dissipation rate integral @xmath70 where @xmath71 solves ( [ eq1])-([p - bc ] ) .      a steady extensional flow of the effective fluid is characterized by a constant extension rate @xmath31 .",
    "the velocity @xmath72 satisfies the extensional boundary conditions ( [ ext - fbc ] ) . the extensional viscosity ( see , e.g. @xcite .",

    ", the effective extensional viscosity can be defined in terms of the suspension dissipation rate @xmath51 , as follows .",
    "@xmath76 and calculation of @xmath1 again reduces to evaluation of the total dissipation rate ( [ dirint ] ) with @xmath61 replaced by @xmath77 . in the remaining part of the paper we derive asymptotic formulas for the total dissipation rate under boundary conditions ( [ shear - fbc ] ) and ( [ ext - fbc ] )",

    "therefore , it makes sense to look for conditions on the network which would guarantee that every solution of the homogeneous system is of the form @xmath210 . then the non - homogeneous system ( [ compls ] )",
    "would be uniquely solvable up to horizontal translation . in section 7.3",

    "if a periodicity cell corresponding to a simple cubic lattice is subjected to a uniform shear ( extensional ) flow , then the straightforward calculation presented above shows that the shear ( extensional ) effective viscosity exhibits weak ( strong ) blow up . however , for other lattice types such as bcc and fcc , formulas from @xcite imply strong blow up of both viscosities , while our approach leads to the weak blow up of the shear viscosity for all two - dimensional lattices .",
    "perhaps , this can be attributed to the fact that in @xcite effective viscosity is defined in a different way , as explained in the introduction . in particular",
    ", our definition takes into account boundary effects which are known to be essential in rheological measurements ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "considerations based on infinite periodic lattices can not capture these boundary effects .",
    "futhermore , if our approach is applied to a rectangular periodic lattice in a rectangular domain chosen so that lattice periodicity is preserved , then our results are consistent with @xcite .",
    "we have studied properties of the network approximation of the shear effective viscosity @xmath0 and extensional effective viscosity @xmath1 of two - dimensional flows of concentrated suspensions with complex geometry .",
    "the flow domain was chosen to be a square , upper and lower sides of which represented the physical flow boundary , while the other two sides were assumed to be free surfaces .",
    "a small inter - particle distance parameter @xmath2 was used to describe the high concentration regime for particle arrays which are not necessarily periodic ( i. g. random ) . in the recent paper @xcite by sierou and brady , the high frequency dynamic viscosity of concentrated suspensions ( see @xcite ) was calculated as a function of volume fraction @xmath3 by means of accelerated stokesian dynamics simulations .",
    "numerical results indicate a singular behaviour of the effective viscosity as @xmath3 approaches the maximal close packing fraction @xmath4 .",
    "we quote here from ( @xcite ) :  ... the exact form of this singular behaviour is not known .",
    "results from lubrication theory for cubic lattices would suggest that the singular form should consist both of @xmath351 and @xmath352 , where @xmath353 , but the relative amount of each term is unknown ... as far as we are able to tell at this point , the @xmath352 behaviour accurately describes the numerical data .     when the volume fraction is ( approximately ) constant over the flow region , @xmath354 .",
    "one of the objectives of our investigation was to address the issue of the unexpectedly weak blow up in @xcite , and determine the asymptotic order of the effective viscosity coefficients as @xmath134 .",
    "our analysis of the shear viscosity @xmath0 , based on the discrete network approximation , showed that @xmath218 as @xmath134 , while the formal estimate based of the local lubrication analysis would give a higher rate @xmath291 . in dimension three , the corresponding rates , given by the network approximation , are , respectively , @xmath216 and @xmath212 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis offers an explanation of the weak blow up of the shear viscosity .",
    "this analysis is also consistent with the numerical simulations in @xcite up to the difference in the space dimension .",
    "we also show that the asymptotic order of the extensional viscosity @xmath1 depends on the geometry of the particle array . for generic disordered arrays",
    "the network partitions the domain into polygons ( delaunay cells ) , most of which are triangles .",
    "we have showed that for these generic arrays @xmath355 .",
    "the same asymptotic rate is obtained for a larger class of networks called quasi - triangulated . in a quasi - triangulated network",
    ", the percentage of triangular cells may be relatively small , but the subnetwork containing triangular cells must be spanning .",
    "another class of networks for which @xmath355 consists of rectangular periodic arrays aligned with the boundary of the flow .",
    "more generally , the same rate is obtained for arrays containing a single spanning chain of neighboring particles , perpendicular to the part of the boundary where the velocity is prescribed .",
    "we show that in case of the strong blow up , the leading term in the asymptotics of @xmath1 can be uniquely determined by solving a simplified linear system of the network equations , provided the array is quasi - triangulated .",
    "the simplified system , obtained by neglecting rotational and pairwise shear motions of particles , provides an efficient computational tool for evaluating the dependence of the effective viscosity on the geometry of the particle array and external boundary conditions .",
    "when a network contains neither a spanning triangulated subgraph , nor a spanning vertical path , the extensional effective viscosity can be of order @xmath166 .",
    "this weak blow up is obtained , for instance , in the case of a periodic rectangular lattice , with interior edges misaligned with the orientation of the prescribed boundary data .",
    "our results imply that the ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath0 for generic disordered particle arrays is @xmath356 .",
    "by contrast , in a newtonian fluid this ratio depends only on the space dimension .",
    "therefore , our results indicate possible non - newtonian behaviour of the effective fluid .",
