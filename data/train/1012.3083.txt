    "our universe is supposed to verify the strong cosmological principle which demands homogeneity and isotropy at all scales .",
    "this standard approach , known as friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) cosmology obeys the set of equations ,    @xmath0    that , together with equations of state as relations between the homogeneous variables , e.g. between the pressures and energy densities , forms a closed system .",
    "the flrw framework is widely used in order to describe the dynamics of our universe and the formation of its constituents .",
    "it , however , leaves in suspense an explanation about the origin of dark energy and dark matter , which respectively represent in this model about 3/4 and 1/4 of the total content of the universe model .",
    "this last point might actually reveal a symptom of a deeper problem linked to this approach .",
    "indeed , in flrw cosmology one determines background quantities regardless of the scale and makes them evolve according to a homogeneous  isotropic solution of einstein s equations .",
    "but , are the background quantities well  defined within standard cosmology , _",
    "i.e. _ as a suitable average over the inhomogeneities ? is their evolution well  approximated in this framework , _",
    "i.e. _ is the time dependence of the homogeneous ",
    "isotropic averaged state well approximated by a homogeneous  isotropic solution ?",
    "all these issues can be routed back to the nonlinearity of the gravitational equations and the averaging problem @xcite .    rewriting einstein s equations via the adm formalism and spatially averaging , in a domain  dependent way , the scalar parts of the equations with respect to free  falling fluid elements , the averaged dynamics of an inhomogeneous universe model filled with a pressureless fluid assumes the following form @xcite :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the effective scale factor",
    ", @xmath3 is the energy density of the irrotational dust averaged over a compact , mass  preserving domain @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the kinematical backreaction term ( an extrinsic curvature invariant ) , and finally @xmath6 is the curvature deviation from a constant  curvature @xmath7 according to the flrw solution ( an intrinsic curvature invariant ) .",
    "these variables are defined as    @xmath8    with @xmath9 the initial volume of the domain and @xmath10 its volume at a proper time @xmath11 , @xmath12 the rate of expansion , @xmath13 the rate of shear , and @xmath14 the @xmath15ricci scalar curvature . comparing the set of equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , one",
    "easily notices that the average evolution of an inhomogeneous universe model differs from the evolution of a homogeneous one .",
    "the change of the cosmological background evolution is here driven by the non  trivial geometrical structure of an inhomogeneous space , and the corresponding deviations are encoded into the backreaction terms @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which are coupled through the relation ( [ eq : inhom_dyn ] ) .",
    "other formulations of the effective inhomogeneous equations can be done .",
    "the first one aims at considering the backreaction terms as an effective fluid by introducing an effective perfect fluid energy momentum tensor with @xmath16 leading to the following reformulation of the system ( 2 ) :    @xmath17    where we see that the coupling between the backreaction terms now stands for the conservation law of the backreaction fluid .",
    "we also appreciate that , like in the standard model , we need an equation of state to close the system that here is dynamical and furnishes a relation between the effective sources .",
    "we shall consider two of such equations of state employed as closure conditions for the set of equations ( 5 ) .",
    "the second reformulation , suggested by the form of the effective sources ( [ backreactionfluid ] ) @xcite , consists in describing the backreaction fluid by a minimally coupled real scalar field @xmath18 ,  called the _ morphon field _ , evolving in an effective potential @xmath19 @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 for a standard scalar field ( with a positive kinetic energy ) , and @xmath22 for a phantom scalar field ( with a negative kinetic energy ) .",
    "the scalar field language leads to the following _ correspondence relations _ :    @xmath23    where the klein ",
    "gordon equation is simply the counterpart of the conservation law for the backreaction fluid .",
    "this correspondence allows us to interpret the kinematical backreaction effects in terms of the properties of scalar field cosmologies , notably quintessence or phantom  quintessence scenarii that are here routed back to models of inhomogeneities .",
    "in the above introduced effective inhomogeneous cosmologies , the dark components may be unified through the kinematical backreaction : @xmath24 effectively mimics dark matter and @xmath25 effectively mimics dark energy . both dark energy and dark matter",
    "are then not included as additional sources but are both manifestations of spatial geometrical properties .",
    "another unification of the dark components is realized thanks to the standard chaplygin gas ( cg ) .",
    "this exotic fluid , whose state equation reads @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , has the interesting property to connect dark matter and dark energy behaviors via its evolution @xcite .",
    "the two previous features motivate us to build a model in which the backreaction fluid is supposed to obey a scale  dependent cg equation of state : @xmath28 with @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this construction allows to unify the dark components , first , simultaneously , thanks to the scale dependence of the backreaction fluid , and , second , through its evolution .",
    "the origin and the magnitude of the dark energy ( first situation in figure 1 ) and of both dark energy and dark matter ( second situation in figure 1 ) can be entirely explained by the particular geometrical structure of an inhomogeneous space obeying the chaplygin equation of state .    in our framework , it is necessary to reinterpret observational data .",
    "indeed , angular diameter and luminosity distances , for instance , depend on metrical properties related to the averaged scalar curvature which evolves differently compared with its friedmannian counterpart . in light of this remark",
    "it is premature to exclude @xcite the standard chaplygin equation of state as providing a good match with observational data .    finally ,",
    "note also that , depending on the initial conditions of the kinematical backreaction , the volume of the domain @xmath4 might undergo different dynamics : its expansion is first decelerated then accelerated ; its expansion is always accelerated ; or its expansion is accelerated , then decelerated and again accelerated @xcite .",
    "the latter case is an interesting situation since two accelerated phases occur .",
    "our model only concerns the matter  dominated universe ; however , this situation allows us to imagine that the accelerated phase in primordial inflation and the one occurring today might be driven by the same mechanism that has to be studied in a more general model .",
    "indeed , we are going to explain the first steps towards a modeling of inflation in the next section .",

    "the effect of inhomogeneities can play a role in _ primordial _ cosmology too , when using the morphon description .",
    "indeed , inflation , the most prevalent paradigm used to cure the flatness , smoothness and horizon issues of the standard model of cosmology , is often described through the dominance of a slow  rolling scalar field , namely the inflaton , over the other components of the energy budget . furthermore , there is a general trend relying on the flrw description to assume inflation unsustainable when the initial conditions are even slightly inhomogeneous , contrary to the idea that inflation should stem from _ chaotic _ initial conditions .",
    "we offer the idea @xcite that the morphon can formally play the role of an effective inflaton and that inhomogeneities could be the actual cause of a de sitter  like era prior to the last scattering surface . in this case ,",
    "several interpretations emerge and differ from ordinary chaotic inflation :    * the nature of the inflaton is solved ; * the inflaton / morphon is purely classical , therefore its value is no longer bounded by @xmath37 , and eternal inflation is naturally avoided ; * the inflaton s wave equation does not come from an additional term in the action but is rather given by the morphon s integrability condition ( [ eq : inhom_dyn ]",
    ". , [ eq : morphon ] ) ; * the choice of the potential is forced by physical requirements such as * * a true initial conditions freedom of choice ( @xmath38 , see figure 2 ) , * * the necessity to end the expansion at one point , * * the necessity to describe the vanishing of inhomogeneities at that end , * the emergence of inflation within a ( physical ) inhomogeneous background is allowed / favored .    motivated by these requirements we choose the ginzburg ",
    "landau potential , @xmath39 as a sufficiently generic and conservative example of an initial conditions poorly dependent potential , while the kinetic part of the morphon is canonical ( @xmath40 ) .    .",
    "the arrows schematically indicate the amplitude of the morphon s initial speed @xmath41 . in the order of the points ( from left to right ) : the first two points dominated by shear fluctuations ( red , green ) are obtained for @xmath42 ; the next points dominated by expansion fluctuations ( blue , pink ) for @xmath43 , where the de sitter@xmath44 equivalent case has a stiff morphon @xmath45 ; the homogeneous case ( last point , orange ) is obtained for @xmath46.,width=264 ]          and show in figure 3 how , even in the absence of matter ( @xmath50 ) , the energy density in the friedmannian curvature @xmath51 strongly decays and converts into the backreaction terms , while @xmath52 is the condition tantamount to inflation . in the presence of pressure ",
    "less matter , the same scenario occurs , irrespective of the initial conditions .",
    "related publications will soon appear on the the various attempts we made to render inflation implicit and duration natural in inhomogeneous cosmologies .",
    "we shall consider the interaction of the morphon with radiation , dust , and a fundamental scalar field , and we shall address the horizon problem .",
    "another analysis is dedicated to the global instability of the flrw backgrounds employing a dynamical system analysis of the averaged equations in the phase space of the cosmological parameters .",
