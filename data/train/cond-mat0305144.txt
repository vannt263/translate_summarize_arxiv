    "geometrically frustrated metallic systems have attracted much interest since the discovery of the heavy fermion behavior in the transition metal oxide , @xmath0@xcite . this compound has the spinel structure and the band calculations show that the conduction bands are essentially composed of vanadium 3@xmath1 orbitals , which are well separate from the oxygen 2@xmath2 bands .",
    "therefore when low - energy properties are concerned , it is sufficient to consider only the vanadium 3@xmath1 orbitals @xcite .",
    "the vanadium sublattice in the spinel structure constitutes a network of corner - sharing tetrahedra , i.e. , the pyrochlore lattice , and this is a typical example of geometrically frustrated lattices in three dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "various works have revealed unusual low - energy properties of spin systems on the pyrochlore lattice , including the presence of thermodynamic degeneracy of the ground states @xcite .",
    "another metallic pyrochlore compound , @xmath3 , also exhibits the heavy fermion behavior where unusual feature has been observed in the dynamical susceptibility @xcite . in both compounds ,",
    "no long - range order has been observed and the specific heat coefficient is strongly enhanced at low temperatures , similar to the lanthanide or actinide heavy - fermion systems .",
    "the heavy fermion behavior in the lanthanide or actinide systems is , as well known , attributed to the kondo effect and the presence of localized @xmath4-orbital is essential to this mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , in these transition - metal heavy fermion systems , 3@xmath1 electrons are much more mobile than @xmath4-electrons and the presence of local magnetic moment has not been detected so far .",
    "it is highly nontrivial whether the enormous mass enhancement is also attributed to the kondo effect , and there may exist another mechanism leading to the heavy fermion - like behavior .",
    "this indeed gives rise to a number of theoretical proposals on the mechanism of the formation of heavy quasi - particles . among them",
    ", it has been claimed that geometrical frustration plays an important role even in the metallic phase when the electron interactions are sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) kagom lattice is another geometrically frustrated system , which may be regarded as a 2d analog of the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "antiferromagnetic spin systems on this lattice have been intensively studied and many unusual properties have been found .",
    "for example , in the @xmath5 heisenberg antiferromagnet , there exists a finite energy gap between the singlet ground state and triplet excitations , and a thermodynamic number of singlet excitations exist within the singlet - triplet gap due to strong frustration@xcite .",
    "this level scheme of excitations is in common with that for the spin systems on the 3d pyrochlore lattice , and it may be quite generic in geometrically frustrated systems . if electrons become itinerant , electron motion will be coupled to both spin - triplet and spin - singlet excitations .",
    "therefore , quasi - particles in this case may be renormalized in a different manner than other more conventional cases without frustration . to study this issue",
    ", we will investigate the correlation effects in the 2d kagom lattice .",
    "the kagom lattice is simpler than the pyrochlore lattice due to the low dimensionality , but otherwise its magnetic properties in the insulating phase are in common with those in the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "therefore , the study on a metallic kagom system is a good starting point to investigate how geometrical frustration affects physical properties in a metallic phase , and we expect that many of the results will hold in the other frustrated systems including the pyrochlore system .    in this paper , we will investigate the effects of geometrical frustration of the kagom lattice on physical properties . in particular , we focus on the possibility of magnetic instability and its relationship to the nature of quasi - particles in a metallic phase .",
    "we employ the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation @xcite for electron correlations and calculate the spin and charge susceptibilities , and the one - particle spectral function .",
    "we will show that geometrical frustration of the kagom lattice indeed suppresses the instability to various ordered states , and stabilizes the formation of quasi - particles .",

    "[ fig : vk ] ( d ) ) and the ratio of the largest and smallest velocity is about @xmath137 for @xmath71 . with increasing @xmath28 , the ratio is gradually reduced to the smaller value of about @xmath138 for @xmath139 , indicating again the suppression of the * k*-dependence . on the other hand , for the anisotropic case @xmath140 , the ratio is not reduced but enhanced .",
    "for instance , for @xmath100 , the ratio changes from about @xmath141 for @xmath103 to @xmath142 for @xmath139 .",
    "these results are in accordance with those of the renormalization factor in the sense that the wavevector dependence grows with increasing hopping anisotropy .",
    "in this paper , we have studied how geometrical frustration of the isotropic / anisotropic kagom lattice affects physical properties in a metallic phase . by using the flex approximation for the hubbard model at half - filling",
    ", we have calculated the spin and charge susceptibility , the one - particle spectrum , the total spectral density , the quasi - particle renormalization factor , and the fermi velocity . in the isotropic kagom lattice",
    ", we have shown that the spin susceptibility is enhanced by the coulomb interaction as far as the amplitude of susceptibility is concerned . however ,",
    "in contrast to ordinary cases of magnetic instability , its wavevector dependence is strongly suppressed at the same time , and there appear many peaks in the bz accumulating to form a line .",
    "this reduction of the wavevector dependence around the fermi surface is also observed for other quantities , such as the quasi - particle weight of the one - particle spectrum .",
    "we have demonstrated that this behavior is indeed due to the frustrated lattice geometry by controlling frustration by anisotropic hopping ; the * k*-dependence is considerably recovered with the decrease of @xmath11 i.e. when frustration is reduced . by comparing the spin susceptibility calculated by the flex approximation with that of rpa",
    ", we have shown that the instability to magnetically ordered phases is dramatically suppressed by mode - mode couplings of fluctuations , which are neglected in the rpa level .",
    "this suppression is most prominent in the isotropic case , i.e. most frustrated case .",
    "furthermore , considering the one - particle spectrum , we have shown that the coherent part has a large weight in the isotropic kagom lattice up to larger @xmath28 regime , which is also consistent with the behaviors of the renormalization factor and fermi velocity .",
    "these results indicate that geometrical frustration stabilizes the formation of quasi - particles .",
    "the main conclusion of the present study is that the strong geometrical frustration reduces the wavevector dependence of spin fluctuations and suppresses the instabilities to various orders , such as the sdw , cdw , and current - carrying states , so that the metallic state is stabilized and the quasi - particles become well - defined in the isotropic kagom lattice .",
    "this conclusion derived from the flex approximation , which is a essentially weak - coupling approach , but it is consistent with the results known for the strong coupling model , i.e. , the absence of any magnetic order due to strong frustration in the antiferromagnetic spin system on the kagom lattice .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable that characteristic properties discussed in the present work for the weak - coupling hubbard model on the kagom lattice are naturally connected to those inherent in the frustrated heisenberg spin system .    within the flex approximation in this paper ,",
    "we have not observed other ordered states , either such as the staggered flux ( current - carrying ) state @xcite and the charge ordered state@xcite etc .",
    ", which are other possible orders in the strong coupling regime . in the present case of half - filling , although charge ordered states are unlikely , a staggered flux state may appear due to strong geometrical frustration .",
    "furthermore , upon finite hole doping , geometrical frustration may realize a charge ordered state .",
    "it is an interesting open problem to be addressed in the future .",
    "experimentally , most compounds studied so far have been restricted to spin systems on the kagom lattice , such as @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "it is thus interesting to study electron correlations in metallic kagom lattice materials .",
