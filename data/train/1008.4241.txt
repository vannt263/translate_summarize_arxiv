    "when critical fluctuations in a medium are confined by the presence of macroscopic bodies such as walls , long - range effective forces between these bodies are induced .",
    "this phenomenon , first pointed out by fisher and de gennes @xcite , is the thermal analogue of the familiar casimir effect between metallic objects caused by fluctuations of the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "it has attracted considerable attention during the past 15 years @xcite .",
    "its indirect experimental verification through the thinning of @xmath24he wetting layers near the lambda transition @xcite some time ago and the more recent first direct measurement of such casimir forces for binary fluid mixtures @xcite are likely to spur further interest and increasing research activities in this field .",
    "previous studies of critical casimir forces in statistical physics have focused exclusively on macroscopic media exhibiting _ isotropic _ scale invariance in the absence of confining walls and macroscopic bodies .",
    "the characteristic feature of such systems is that they become self - similar when distances @xmath25 along arbitrary directions are rescaled by a scale factor @xmath26 .",
    "alternatively , one can say that the bulk correlation lengths characterizing the decay of correlations along all directions exhibit the same power - law divergence @xmath27 as the temperature @xmath28 approaches the bulk critical temperature @xmath29 .    in this paper",
    "we shall be concerned with _ strongly anisotropic _ scale - invariant systems . in bulk systems of this kind there exist one or several principal directions along which coordinate separations @xmath30 must be rescaled by a nontrivial power @xmath31 of the scale factor @xmath32 associated with the remaining principal directions in order to have self - similarity of the initial and transformed systems .",
    "the asymptotic power laws @xmath33 of the respective bulk correlation lengths @xmath34 and @xmath35 are governed by distinct exponents @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "such systems are ubiquitous in nature",
    ". important examples of equilibrium systems whose ( multi)critical equilibrium states exhibit anisotropic scale invariance ( asi ) are systems at lifshitz points @xcite and liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "furthermore , asi is a common feature of the stationary states of many nonequilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "we shall show that the casimir forces induced by confinement of fluctuations in systems exhibiting asi differ _ qualitatively and quantitatively _ from their analogues for isotropic scale - invariant systems .    consider a system confined by two parallel planes at a distance @xmath11 , each of which has area @xmath38 .",
    "the reduced free energy of the system per area @xmath38 can be written as @xmath39 in the limit @xmath40 at fixed @xmath11 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are @xmath11-independent bulk and surface excess densities .",
    "the ellipsis in @xmath43 stands for additional thermodynamic bulk fields ( such as magnetic field or chemical potential ) ; the one in @xmath44 represents both bulk fields of this kind as well as additional surface variables ( such as surface interaction constants ) .",
    "the @xmath11-dependence resides in the so - defined residual free - energy density @xmath45 . for given medium and boundary planes ,",
    "this function decays at the bulk critical point as @xmath46 as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are metric factors ( units of area and length , respectively ) . at conventional critical points exhibiting isotropic scale invariance",
    ", one has @xmath50 for the decay exponent .",
    "furthermore , the metric factors are chosen to satisfy @xmath51 for systems whose correlation regimes are hyperspherical ( i.e. , whose bulk correlation lengths @xmath52 characterizing the decay of correlations along different spatial directions diverge with the same exponent _ and _ have equal amplitudes @xmath53 ) .",
    "this choice guarantees that @xmath48 and @xmath49 drop out of equation  ( [ eq : frescrit ] ) .",
    "the `` casimir amplitude '' @xmath54 depends on gross properties of the medium ( universality class ) and the boundaries , namely , the boundary conditions ( bc ) that hold on large length scales @xcite , but is independent of microscopic details ( universal ) . to avoid confusion ,",
    "let us explain how the metric factors @xmath48 and @xmath49 ought to be chosen when the hypersphericity condition on the correlation regime is violated in the way weakly anisotropic critical systems do @xcite . for those , the bulk correlation lengths @xmath55 associated with distinct directions diverge with the same critical exponent @xmath56 but involve several different amplitudes @xmath53 , so that their correlation regime is hyperellipsoidal .",
    "their critical behavior can be expressed in terms of that of standard isotropic systems such as the conventional @xmath57 model @xcite .",
    "the required transformation that makes the correlation regime hyperspherical  a similarity transformation followed by a rescaling of the principal radii  generally changes @xmath48 and @xmath49 into transformed values @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( see p.  1517",
    "of @xcite ] ) . to define @xmath60 for weakly anisotropic systems in a consistent manner , one must simply choose @xmath58 and @xmath59 according to our rule for isotropic systems , requiring them to drop out of the corresponding analogue of equation  ( [ eq : frescrit ] ) .",
    "the anisotropy one encounters in weakly anisotropic critical systems is of a fairly harmless kind : it can be transformed away , absorbed by a proper choice of ( nonuniversal ) coordinates .",
    "this is not the case for systems exhibiting asi .",
    "their anisotropy is of a more profound type .",
    "this has important consequences for fluctuation - induced forces .",
    "general aspects of the orientation of the boundary planes matter .",
    "two fundamentally distinct orientations must be distinguished : parallel ( @xmath6 ) , for which the normals to the boundary planes are oriented along a @xmath8-direction , and perpendicular ( @xmath5 ) , for which the normals are parallel to an @xmath7- but perpendicular to all @xmath8-directions .",
    "if one has @xmath15 @xmath7- and @xmath61 @xmath8-directions in a @xmath0-dimensional system , then the corresponding decay exponents are given by @xmath62 in the cases of @xmath15-axial lifshitz points , which we explicitly consider in the following , the value of the anisotropy exponent @xmath63 is close to @xmath64 ; one has @xmath65 , @xcite where @xmath66 is the deviation of the bulk dimension @xmath0 from the corresponding upper critical dimension @xmath16 of the system .",
    "the associated casimir amplitudes @xmath67 and @xmath68 depend on the bc , and generally differ for perpendicular and parallel orientations .",
    "how they should be defined in order to avoid trivial dependences on nonuniversal metric factors needs to be clarified .",
    "the results  ( [ eq : zetas ] ) for the decay exponents can be understood by simple scaling arguments .",
    "the residual reduced free energy density @xmath69 has dimension @xmath70 where @xmath38 scales as @xmath71 and @xmath72 for parallel and perpendicular surface orientations , respectively .",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath1 are the only relevant lengths besides @xmath11 , then equation  ( [ eq : zetas ] ) should hold . and @xmath1 are bulk correlation lengths , they diverge at the bulk critical point . in later sections",
    "we shall also consider finite - size correlation lengths .",
    "these remain finite at the bulk critical point when @xmath73 . ]    to substantiate these claims and verify explicitly that the casimir amplitudes differ for parallel and perpendicular slab orientations , we shall investigate a familiar class of prototype @xmath14-vector models exhibiting asi  namely , @xmath74",
    "@xmath57  models with an @xmath15-axial bulk lifshitz point ( lp ) @xcite in a slab geometry .",
    "the cases of parallel and perpendicular orientations of the boundary planes will both be studied under periodic ( pbc ) and free ( fbc ) boundary conditions . however , when considering fbc , we shall restrict ourselves in two ways : we assume that the bc that result in the large length - scale limit ( i ) do not break the @xmath74 symmetry and ( ii ) are associated with the respective most stable renormalization - group ( rg ) fixed point . for parallel orientation",
    "this simply means that dirichlet bc @xmath75 hold asymptotically @xcite . in the case of perpendicular orientation ,",
    "two _ bc hold on either boundary plane .",
    "these simplify in the large - length - scale limit to the conditions that both the order parameter @xmath76 and its normal derivative @xmath77 @xcite vanish .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the models and specify their hamiltonians including the boundary terms they involve in the cases of free boundary planes . in section  [ sec : bc ] we first give the mesoscopic bc that result from the boundary contributions to the classical equations of motion in the cases of parallel and perpendicular slab orientations . assuming that the values of the surface interaction constants comply with the above - mentioned conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) , we then recapitulate which asymptotic boundary conditions are encountered in the limit of large length scales . in section  [ sec : bgptrg ] we recall the background on the renormalization of these models at and below their upper critical dimensions @xmath16 and the field - theoretic rg approach to bulk and surface critical behavior at lp required for our subsequent analysis of the casimir forces .",
    "we then turn to the calculation of fluctuation - induced forces at the lp .",
    "the case of parallel slab orientation is dealt with in section  [ sec : calcpar ] , that of perpendicular orientation in section  [ sec : caperp ] .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] provides a brief summary and concluding remarks .",

    "however , perturbative rg approaches that are capable of dealing with critical behavior in bulk and semi - infinite systems ( such as those based on the @xmath268 expansion ) fall short of reaching this ambitious goal .",
    "even the more modest aim of obtaining well - defined asymptotic expansions in @xmath268 at the bulk ( multi)critical point may prove elusive for certain large - distance bc involving zero modes at the level of landau theory .",
    "it comes as no surprise that these problems turned out to be more pronounced and severe than in previous analogous studies of casimir interactions at bulk critical points @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the present study of finite - size properties involves a bulk _",
    "_ multi__critical point , the lp .",
    "if the values of @xmath0 and @xmath15 are such that a lp continues to exist for finite @xmath11 , the theory must be able to account in a reliable fashion for the shifts of the lp and the phase boundaries that meet at it .",
    "for @xmath506 and finite @xmath11 , the situation is even more complicated .",
    "one expects the thermal fluctuations to destabilize the phases with homogeneous and modulated order so that the critical lines get replaced by pseudo - critical ones and no real lp may be expected to exist for finite @xmath11 ( see @xcite and their references ) .",
    "an appealing feature of the large-@xmath14 limit is that it is capable of dealing with thermal fluctuations and dimensional crossover in a mathematically controlled fashion .",

    "finally , let us briefly comment on the question of verification of the casimir amplitudes investigated here .",
    "previous experimental investigations of thermodynamic casimir forces have focused for very good reasons on fluid systems @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using fluid systems is that the number of degrees of freedom of the medium ( fluid ) between macroscopic bodies ( e.g. , walls ) can vary , a fact which enables direct and indirect confirmations of such fluctuation - induced forces .",
    "by contrast , the continuum models exhibiting anisotropic scale invariance on large distance scales considered here have natural realizations as lattice models ( such as the annni model in the uniaxial case @xcite ) and rely on the presence of corresponding lattice anisotropies .",
    "unlike fluid systems , such systems do not lend themselves to direct measurements of thermodynamic casimir forces . on the other hand ,",
    "the casimir amplitudes we considered are finite - size quantities .",
    "just as other finite - size quantities ( which are not necessarily measurable via induced forces ) , they are well - defined observables that at least in principle should be measurable . at the moment ,",
    "the most promising means of checking our predictions appears to be monte carlo simulations .",
    "this technique was successfully used already some time ago to study the surface critical behavior of bounded three - dimensional annni models @xcite .",
    "appropriate extensions of this work along the lines of recent monte carlo investigations of thermodynamic casimir forces near critical points @xcite should be possible and enable reliable checks of our predictions .",
    "we hope that the present work will stimulate such investigations of fluctuation - induced interactions in strongly anisotropic critical systems .",

    "<S> strongly anisotropic critical systems are considered in a @xmath0-dimensional film geometry . </S>",
    "<S> such systems involve two ( or more ) distinct correlation lengths @xmath1 and @xmath2 that scale as nontrivial powers of each other , i.e.  @xmath3 with anisotropy index @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> thus two fundamental orientations , perpendicular ( @xmath5 ) and parallel ( @xmath6 ) , for which the surface normal is oriented along an @xmath7- and @xmath8-direction , respectively , must be distinguished . </S>",
    "<S> the confinement of critical fluctuations caused by the film s boundary planes is shown to induce effective forces @xmath9 that decay as @xmath10 as the film thickness @xmath11 becomes large , where the proportionality constants involve nonuniversal amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the decay exponents @xmath12 and the casimir amplitudes @xmath13 are universal but depend on the type of orientation . to corroborate these findings , @xmath14-vector models with an @xmath15-axial bulk lifshitz point are investigated by means of rg methods below the upper critical dimension @xmath16 under periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) and free bc of an asymptotic form pertaining to the respective ordinary surface transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the exponents @xmath12 are determined , and explicit results to one- or two - loop order are presented for several casimir amplitudes @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the large-@xmath14 limits of the casimir amplitudes @xmath18 for periodic and dirichlet bc are shown to be proportional to their critical - point analogues at dimension @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the limiting values @xmath20 are determined exactly for the uniaxial cases @xmath21 under periodic bc . </S>",
    "<S> unlike @xmath22 , the amplitude @xmath23 is positive , so that the corresponding casimir force is repulsive .    </S>",
