    "different scenarios were proposed .",
    "it was suggested that the effect is due to coulomb interaction , which favors a quantum hall ferromagnet ground state.@xcite alicea and fisher@xcite proposed that the plateaus might be related to symmetry breaking terms , such as zeeman and underlying lattice interactions , which give rise to a paramagnetic phase as it occurs at @xmath14 .",
    "an explanation based on the so - called `` magnetic catalysis '' mechanism was proposed by gusynin _",
