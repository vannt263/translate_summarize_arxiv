    "as a modern theory of strong interaction , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is supposed to give us the possibility to describe all properties of observed hadrons , such as the structure of nucleon . however , due to its nonperturbative difficulty in infrared region and the complexity of hadronic phenomena , this is still impossible .",
    "we have to rely on the qcd - inspired phenomenological models , such as bag model and constituent quark model , to describe effectively some properties of observed hadrons . with their close relation to the experimental observables , the deeper investigations to these models",
    "are expected to give some hints for the solutions of qcd , or strong interaction .",
    "the strangeness in nucleon may provide important observables for studying various models .    according to the quark parton model , which is the consequence of qcd ,",
    "a nucleon is composed of 3 valence quarks plus a fluctuating number of gluons and sea quark anti - quark pairs . since the strange quarks are the lightest quarks different from nucleon s valence quarks , the strangeness in the nucleon is of particular interest for understanding the role of sea quarks .",
    "experiments have indicated that strange quarks do , in fact , play a fundamental role in understanding properties of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "it could be interpreted that the existence of strangeness in nucleon is a nonperturbative effect .",
    "then the question can be asked , in what kind of form do these strange quarks exist in the nucleon ?",
    "many models have been proposed .",
    "the widely used ones are meson cloudy model and chiral constituent quark model .    recently , in order to explain the empirical indications for a positive strangeness magnetic moment of the proton , a new possible configuration has been proposed for the strangeness in the proton @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath3 in the ground state and the @xmath4 system in the @xmath5 state .",
    "the new configuration can also reproduce other strangeness properties of the proton @xcite and has been successfully extended to explain properties of other baryons @xcite . in order to further check the validity of the new configuration , study of the asymmetry of parton distribution functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 versus the momentum fraction @xmath8 and its consequence would be a proper choice .",
    "the possible asymmetry of @xmath6 and @xmath7 has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite by signal and thomas and further explored by other authors @xcite .",
    "the analysis of related experimental data @xcite seems not conclusive , and the limit of the @xmath0-@xmath1 asymmetry quoted in @xcite is @xmath9 < 0.004 $ ] , where @xmath10 = \\int_{0}^{1 } dx x[s(x ) - \\bar{s}(x)]$ ] . the refreshed interest on this subject is prompted by the ",
    "nutev anomaly \" @xcite - a 3@xmath11 deviation of the nutev measured value of @xmath12 ( 0.2277 @xmath13 0.0013@xmath130.0009 ) @xcite from the world average of other measurements ( 0.2227@xmath130.0004 ) .",
    "the contribution of @xmath0-@xmath1 asymmetry to this departure has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of meson - baryon model and chiral constituent quark model , respectively .",
    "it is rather puzzling that the two pictures give entirely different results .    in this article",
    ", we will discuss the difference of the meson - baryon model and chiral constituent quark model related to the strange content in nucleon ; then calculate the second moment of the strange - antistrange distributions @xmath10 $ ] and its contribution to the  nutev anomaly \" with a newly proposed penta - quark model for the strangeness in the proton @xcite .",
    "the strange quark in nucleon sea , as well as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , can be broken down into perturbative and nonperburbative parts .",
    "the perturbative part of @xmath16 due to short - range fluctuation of gluon field has no contribution to the @xmath0-@xmath3 asymmetry .",
    "we only focus on the nonperburbative part , which can exist over the longer time than the interaction time in the deep inelastic process and hence contributes to the @xmath0-@xmath3 asymmetry observables . as discussed in precious section , there are many models about the nonperturbative strange sea quarks . these models can be classified into two sorts : meson - baryon configuration and quark - meson configuration . the dynamical information of the two pictures can be obtained from relevant scattering experiments .    in the meson - baryon configuration",
    ", the nucleon sometimes fluctuates to a baryon plus a meson .",
    "contributions to the strange sea can come from fluctuations involving a hyperon , such as @xmath17 . in this example",
    ", the contribution to the strange quark distribution s(x ) comes from the strange quark in the @xmath18 , while the contribution to the anti - strange distribution @xmath7 comes from the anti - strange quark in the kaon .",
    "then the strange distribution can be calculated by using the valence parton distribution of @xmath18 and kaon , respectively . because of the different fluctuation functions and different parton distributions in @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the calculated results for @xmath6 and @xmath7 are different",
    ". however , there are some theoretical uncertainties in this picture .",
    "first , the dynamical quantities , such as coupling constants , which are derived from reproducing experimental data on scattering processes , may be invalid in applying directly to the interior of the nucleon .",
    "the off - shell extension suffers large uncertainty .",
    "secondly , the parton distributions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which can not be directly calculated from first principle , would also bring large uncertainties to the results .",
    "we will see that these two problems could be avoided in the penta - quark model .    in the chiral constituent quark model with quark - meson configuration ,",
    "the meson octet was introduced as the goldstone particles , which are the consequences of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry ( sbcs ) .",
    "therefore , the quarks are dressed by mesons .",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom in this configuration are constituent quarks and goldstone bosons ( the effect of gluon can be negligible at low energy ) . in this picture",
    ", the constituent quarks couple directly to the gs bosons , for example , @xmath20 .",
    "the contribution to @xmath21 comes from the parton distribution in @xmath19 , and contribution to @xmath6 comes directly from dynamical process .",
    "obviously , this picture also results in different @xmath6 and @xmath7 distributions .",
    "because the sbcs is included in this configuration , which is the nonperturbative effect of qcd , this picture is expected to provide a satisfactory representation for low energy hadron properties .",
    "the results of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 in these two configurations are very different , and even contradictory in some special regions @xcite . and the predicted @xmath0-@xmath1 asymmetry from these two pictures differs by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "while the calculation within the framework of effective chiral quark model claims that the @xmath0-@xmath1 asymmetry can account for about @xmath22 of the nutev anomaly @xcite , the calculations with the meson - baryon configuration give much smaller results ranging from @xmath23 @xcite to @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "besides the choice of parameters , the interaction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with other constituents may be the key to understand this difference . in meson - baryon configuration , the @xmath0",
    "is bound in the hyperon , while the @xmath0 is asymptotic free in the meson - quark picture .",
    "we reckon that the fluctuations of @xmath25 give a harder momentum distribution for @xmath0 than that given by nucleon fluctuations into @xmath26 .",
    "recently a new possible configuration for the five quark components in the nucleon has been proposed @xcite . in the penta - quark model ,",
    "the largest five quark components in the proton are @xmath27 and @xmath28 with the anti - quark in the orbital ground state and the four quarks in the mixed orbital @xmath29_x$ ] symmetry , i.e. , one in p - wave and three in s - wave .",
    "therefore , the quark wave function for the proton may then be expanded as : @xmath30[ud]\\bar d > + a_{s\\bar s }    @xmath31 and @xmath16 , which are interpreted as the probability to find the @xmath32 component and @xmath33 in a proton , can be obtained as @xmath34 and @xmath35 by reproducing the observed light flavor sea quark asymmetry in the proton , @xmath36 and the strangeness spin of the proton , @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "since the @xmath1 in @xmath33 system is in its ground state and the @xmath4 subsystem has mixed orbital symmetry @xmath29_{x}$ ] which gives the possibility of 1/4 for @xmath0 to be in p - wave , this also gives naturally an @xmath0-@xmath3 asymmetry .",
    "the  nutev anomaly \" is an important open question in recent years .",
    "although many sources of it have been explored in the past years @xcite there has been no consistent explanation on this subject .",
    "the measurement of weinberg angle @xmath38 in ref .",
    "@xcite by nutev collaboration is closely related to the paschos - wolfestein(pw ) relation @xcite , which is written as @xmath39 where the three @xmath40 terms are due to the nonisoscalarity of the target ( @xmath41),next - to - leading - order(nlo ) and nonperturbative qcd effects ( @xmath42 ) , and higher - order electroweak effects ( @xmath43 ) , respectively .",
    "the qcd corrections consist of three terms , which can be written as @xmath44 , where the three @xmath40 terms in the right side are due to possible strange asymmetry ( @xmath45 ) and isospin violation ( @xmath46 ) effects ( @xmath47 ) in the parton structure of nucleon , and nlo(@xmath48 ) corrections(@xmath49 ) , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we only focus on the correction from @xmath0-@xmath1 asymmetry , which contributes to @xmath50 as @xmath51}{[q^{-}]},\\ ] ] where @xmath10",
    "\\equiv \\int x[s(x ) - \\bar{s}(x)]dx$ ] quantifying the strangeness asymmetry , and @xmath52 = \\int x[q(x ) - \\bar{q}(x)]dx$ ] with @xmath53/2 $ ] representing the isoscalar valence quark distribution . in order to solve the nutev anomaly , the sigh of @xmath10 $ ] needs to be positive , i.e. @xmath10 > 0 $ ] .",
    "generally , for a nucleon in its @xmath54 configuration created in the fluctuation process @xmath55 with @xmath0 and @xmath1 in @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , the @xmath0 distribution can be expressed as a convolution of fluctuation function @xmath58 with the valence parton distribution @xmath59 in the state @xmath56 ; and the distribution of @xmath1 can be expressed as a convolution of fluctuation function @xmath60 with the valence parton distribution @xmath61 in the state @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "explicitly , the strange and anti - strange quark distributions in the nucleon can be written as @xmath62 with general constraints @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the probability to find the @xmath66 configuration in a nucleon .",
    "the fluctuation function @xmath58 is interpreted as probability to find @xmath67 with a fraction @xmath8 of the nucleon momentum , while the @xmath60 is the probability to find @xmath68 with a fraction @xmath8 of nucleon momentum .",
    "it reflects the dynamical information of the fluctuation process , which is the nonperturbative effect closely related to qcd at large distances .",
    "the dynamical mechanism behind this process may be important for further research .",
    "however , in our case with penta - quark configuration , the thing is getting simpler .",
    "the fluctuation function is just @xmath69 .",
    "the dynamical information of the fluctuation process is included into the probability which can be obtained from experimental data .",
    "this could be one of advantages of the penta - quark model .",
    "the next step in our calculation is to determine parton distribution in the penta - quark configuration .",
    "simple harmonic oscillator wave functions are used with radial part as @xmath70 for the s - state and p - state , respectively . here",
    "@xmath71 with @xmath72 the harmonic oscillator parameter . with these wave functions , the distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in @xmath33 system can be obtained by the method in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the distributions of @xmath73 in the five - quark constituent can be expressed as @xmath74 the light - cone momentum of @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath75 and @xmath76 need to be normalized to 1 .      assuming commonly used values @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the calculated results of @xmath75 and @xmath76 are shown in fig.1 . compared with @xmath1 , the @xmath6 is softer in small x and harder in large x region .",
    "this variation can be easily understood in our theoretical frame , because in the penta - quark model the difference of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in nucleon entirely results from the different distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the @xmath33 component .",
    "while the @xmath3 stays 100% in s - state , the @xmath0 has 25% probability staying in p - state .",
    "hence the @xmath0 is more likely to take larger fraction of nucleon momentum .",
    "the distribution of @xmath79 , with @xmath80 is shown in fig .",
    "2 . the behavior of @xmath81 can be well understood in the penta - quark configuration where the @xmath1 stays in the s - wave around the center of the system while @xmath0 in the @xmath4 has 25% probability in the p - state and gives harder distributions ( @xmath6 ) at large @xmath8 region .",
    "the results are sensitive to the value of parameter @xmath82 .",
    "larger @xmath82 leads to larger difference of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this is because larger @xmath82 gives larger difference between p - state and s - state .",
    "the choice of @xmath83 value makes little effect on the result .",
    "> from these strange parton distributions , assuming @xmath84 and @xmath85 , we obtain @xmath10 = 0.001 $ ] , which can account for 10% of the nutev anomaly .",
    "there is some evidence @xcite suggesting that the @xmath86 constituent is very compact with @xmath82 around @xmath87 . in this case",
    ", the @xmath0-@xmath1 asymmetry would result in @xmath10 = 0.002 $ ] and account for about @xmath24 of nutev anomaly .",
    "the result from the newly proposed penta - quark configuration is much smaller than that from chiral constituent quark model @xcite , but comparable with that of meson - baryon models @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are many other uncertainties in theoretical framework for nutev experiment , and some other corrections may account for the nutev anomaly . the @xmath0-@xmath1 asymmetry may not be the whole story .    *",
