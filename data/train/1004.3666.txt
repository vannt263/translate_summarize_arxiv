    "extensive air showers ( eas ) have been studied over the last 70 years @xcite .",
    "they result from the interaction in the atmosphere of high - energy protons and nuclei arriving from space .",
    "the product of these collisions are a set of secondary particles carrying a fraction of the primary energy .",
    "these secondaries move through the atmosphere and interact again generating new secondaries",
    ". the process continues , increasing the number of secondary particles , until their energies are too low to contribute to the generation of new particles .",
    "particles reaching ground are sampled with arrays of detectors , and their properties are used to infer the properties of the primary initiating the shower .",
    "measurements of the electron and muon density , of the arrival time of the particles at ground , and of the depth at which the shower has the maximum number of particles ( x@xmath1 ) , give information on the arrival direction , primary energy , and on the mass of the primaries @xcite .",
    "the complexity of the cascade phenomena , and the poor knowledge of the hadronic interactions at very high energy @xcite , make the experimental determination of the properties of the primaries very difficult .",
    "moreover , primary particles with the same energy , mass and direction produce secondary particles with parameters that vary from shower to shower .",
    "this feature is called  shower to shower fluctuations \" .",
    "an understanding of the shower to shower fluctuations will help to improve the interpretation of cosmic - ray data .",
    "the calculation of shower to shower fluctuations can in principle be addressed with monte carlo simulations of extensive air showers . however , the number of particles that are produced in an air shower at ultra high energy ( above @xmath2 ev ) is so large ( @xmath3 ) , that it is almost impossible to follow the propagation to ground level of all the secondaries in the monte carlo in a reasonable amount of time , or even to store the large amount of information produced . for this reason , a statistical sampling procedure called  thinning \" @xcite",
    "is used in the simulations .",
    "thinning algorithms typically consist on propagating only a small , representative fraction of the total number of particles in the shower , assigning statistical weights to the sampled particles to compensate for the rejected ones .",
    "however , thinning algorithms introduce artificial fluctuations in the simulated showers , hampering the determination of the intrinsic , physical shower to shower fluctuations with monte carlo simulations . for this reason",
    "the study of fluctuations using monte carlo simulations is quite difficult and uncertain .",
    "this is of utmost importance in cosmic - ray physics , since an incorrect assumption on the shower to shower fluctuations can lead to systematic errors on the determination of the parameters of the primary particles .    in this work",
    "we address the problem of determining the true , physical shower to shower fluctuations in monte carlo simulations , and quantify the effect of thinning on their determination .",
    "we give expressions that allow the estimation of physical fluctuations from monte carlo simulations , even in the case of relatively strongly thinned showers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s : thesimulations ] we describe the simulations performed in this work , and the thinning algorithm adopted . in section [ s : fluctuations ] we identify the different sources of fluctuations in shower simulations . in section [ s : results ] we perform a comprehensive study of the fluctuations in the longitudinal and lateral shower development , and give expressions that allow to separate physical shower to shower fluctuations from the artificial fluctuations induced by the thinning procedure . in section [ s : composition ] , we quantify the influence on the shower to shower fluctuations of the fluctuations of the depth of first interaction of the primary initiating the shower . finally , we summarize our conclusions in section [ s : conclusions ] . in the appendix",
    "we give an explicit mathematical derivation of the expressions presented in section  [ s : results ] .",
    "in this work we have used the air shower simulation program , aires @xcite , along with the hadronic model qgsjet01 @xcite to simulate proton and iron - induced showers with primary energy @xmath4 ev . as explained above , due to the large number of particles that are created in the simulation ,",
    "aires includes a statistical sampling algorithm , that consists on propagating a small , representative fraction of the total number of particles , assigning a statistical weight @xmath5 to the sampled particles to compensate for the rejected ones .",
    "the weight is adjusted in such a way that both the total energy and the average number of particles is guaranteed to be conserved .",
    "before the simulation starts , the user indicates , as an input to aires , the relative thinning level @xmath6 .",
    "the thinning energy @xmath7 - the energy below which the thinning process starts - is defined as @xmath7=@xmath8 where , @xmath9 is the primary energy .",
    "for ultra high energy cosmic ray shower simulations convenient values for the relative thinning are @xmath10 , but the actual choice depends on the purpose of the simulation .",
    "the thinning level affects both the simulation cpu time and the size of the output produced in the simulation , both typically behaving linearly with @xmath11 .",
    "if we increase @xmath6 by a factor of 10 the simulation speeds up by a similar factor , and the output is reduced accordingly , but the price to pay is an enhancement of the artifical fluctuations in the simulated showers as discussed below .",
    "we describe here the thinning algorithm implemented in the aires code @xcite , originally due to hillas @xcite . at the beginning of the simulation ,",
    "the primary particle is assigned a weight @xmath12 . then the primary is propagated and interacts in the atmosphere producing @xmath13 secondary particles . before incorporating any secondary particle in the simulation , the energy of the primary @xmath14 which has generated that secondary is compared to @xmath7 . if @xmath15 , then all the secondaries with energy greater or equal than @xmath7 are kept , and their weight is equal to the weight of the primary particle .",
    "secondaries with energy less than @xmath7 are kept with a probability @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the energy of @xmath18 secondary ) , and their weight is adjusted so that @xmath19 , with @xmath5 being the weight of the mother particle producing that secondary . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath20 , it means that the particle came from a previous thinning operation .",
    "then , one and only one of all the produced secondaries - say the @xmath21 - is kept , with probability @xmath22 .",
    "again , the weight of this particle is increased by a factor @xmath23 .    to avoid confusion between particles and weights , we identify an _ entry _ with a particle explicitely followed in the simulation which is associated a weight @xmath5 .",
    "hence , an entry represents @xmath5 particles .",
    "it is important to stress that once the thinning energy is reached , the number of entries @xmath24 is no longer increased in the shower processes ( only one secondary particle is followed in each interaction ) , while the number of particles @xmath25 does however increase , since the weight of each entry typically increases in the showering process .",
    "when evaluating a physical observable , each entry must be weighted with its corresponding statistical weight .    in aires ,",
    "the thinning algorithm is complemented with an `` extended thinning algorithm '' @xcite , designed to ensure that all the statistical weights are always smaller than a certain positive number ( other algorithms based on this same idea are possible , see for instance @xcite ) . to ensure this , an external parameter called statistical weight factor @xmath26 is available in the simulation . to further optimize the procedure of sampling , separated weight factors for electromagnetic ( @xmath27 ) and heavy particles ( @xmath28 ) ,",
    "are defined .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 is specified indirectly by the ratio : @xmath30 the default value of this ratio in the simulation is @xmath31 .",
    "the default value of the weight factor @xmath27 is 12 . in this paper",
    ", we will use these default values unless otherwise specified .",
    "we have simulated proton and iron - induced showers with primary energy @xmath32 ev , zenith angle @xmath33 and @xmath34 and relative thinning @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( the two latter @xmath6 for proton only ) .",
    "we have also simulated showers with relative thinning of @xmath37 but with @xmath38 instead of the default value .",
    "finally , we have also simulated two sets of proton and iron - induced showers at @xmath39 , with fixed depth of first interaction , starting at the corresponding mean interaction depth for protons and iron at @xmath4 ev .",
    "in a real shower or in a simulation of an eas , there are a number of different fluctuations that can occur .",
    "rather generally , we can make a simple classification as shown in table [ table : exp ] .",
    "`` physical fluctuations '' are those due to physical processes in the shower . here",
    "we split them into those due to the first interaction , and those occuring in the secondary interactions , as is customary , and because it has recently been suggested that `` universal '' shower properties may emerge when considering only the fluctuations in the first interaction point @xcite .",
    "physical fluctuations occuring in the first interaction are further divided into those affecting the depth of the first interaction , and those that arise from fluctuations of multiplicity or inelasticity also in the first interaction .",
    ".classification of the fluctuations in a shower , arising from the physical processes in the shower and the measurement process , and those that appear only in shower simulations . [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in this section we study the influence of the fluctuations in the depth of first interaction on the overall shower to shower fluctuations of the number of particles . in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig13 ] and [ fig : fig14 ] we plot the relative fluctuations @xmath40 in @xmath4 ev proton and iron - induced showers respectively . in all panels",
    "we show the results of our regular simulations , together with the results of a special set of simulations performed by fixing the depth of first interaction of the primary particle ( proton or iron ) at the value of its mean interaction depth predicted by the qgsjet model ( namely 44.9 g/@xmath41 for proton at @xmath4 ev and 10.7 g/@xmath41 for iron at the same energy ) . in all cases we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) to split the fluctuations into artificial and physical fluctuations , and we also show them in the figures .",
    "firstly , it is interesting to see that the artificial fluctuations in the number of electrons or muons in iron showers are approximately equal to those in proton showers , while the physical fluctuations are smaller in iron than in proton - induced showers .",
    "the latter observation is a well - known effect which is attributed to the fact that showers initiated by a nuclei can be considered , in a first approximation , as a superposition of @xmath42 ( atomic mass ) nucleons , each with an energy @xmath43 with @xmath44 the energy of the primary nucleus .",
    "it is rather remarkable that the relative fluctuations in the number of particles @xmath40 in the two different sets of simulations ( fixing or varying the depth of the first interaction point ) , are essentially the same .",
    "this conclusion applies to both the number of electrons and the number of muons .",
    "one could think that this is due to the fluctuations induced by thinning which mask the effect of the fluctuations of the depth of first interaction , however this does not seem to be the case , since as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig13 ] and [ fig : fig14 ] , neither the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) ( the thinning fluctuations ) , nor the second term ( the physical fluctuations ) change much when varying or fixing the depth of first interaction .",
    "we conclude that the relative shower to shower fluctuations on the number of particles at ground @xmath40 are rather insensitive to the physical fluctuations of the depth of first interaction .",
    "this is related to the fact that the maximum of a shower at @xmath39 , where the fluctuations are minimum @xcite , occurs near the ground . for other zenith angles",
    "a small difference appears in the physical fluctuations of the simulations performed with fixed and fluctuated first interaction point .",
    "in this work we have performed a comprehensive study of shower to shower fluctuations by means of monte carlo simulations of extensive air showers .",
    "an understanding of the shower to shower fluctuations will help to improve the interpretation of cosmic - ray data .",
    "we have shown that the determination of the true , physical shower to shower fluctuations is hampered by the thinning procedure necessary to simulate in a practical manner air showers at eev energies and above .",
    "however , we also show that the artificial fluctuations induced by thinning ( @xmath45 ) can be identified and splitted from the physical fluctuations ( @xmath46 ) with the aid of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) , which we have shown to account for all , true and artificial fluctuations appearing in the simulations .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) reproduces the expectation that as the thinning level decreases @xmath47 , and showers are less thinned , then the artificial fluctuations decrease , the physical ones become dominant , and they do not depend on @xmath6 .",
    "our simulations also indicate that the physical shower to shower fluctuations of the number of particles at ground behave proportionally to the number of particles @xmath25 , while the artificial fluctuations are poissonian , i.e. , behave as @xmath48 .    besides",
    ", we have shown that the size of the relative fluctuations due to the depth at which the first interaction initiating the shower occurs , is smaller or of the same order as the fluctuations occuring in the subsequent secondary interactions in the shower .",
    "in this appendix , we calculate the probability distribution of the number of particles @xmath25 in a given bin of @xmath49 distance to shower core , or of energy . making some simplifying assumptions .",
    "we want to calculate the probability distribution of particles , possibly in a given bin of @xmath49 or of energy .",
    "we will assume that the probability for an entry ( a non - thinned particle ) to have a weight @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 .",
    "in addition the number of entries , @xmath24 in a given shower is a random variable with probability distribution @xmath52 .",
    "our main simplifying assumption is the following : we will assume that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are independent of each other .",
    "this assumption is only approximate , because in a shower simulated with thinning both the entries and the weight assigned to each particle are controlled by the branching of the shower and therefore they must be related .",
    "however , as we will see a posteriori , the approximation is good enough for our purposes here , and it serves to clarify the role of thinning .    under this approximation",
    "we can write the probability @xmath55 of having @xmath25 particles as , @xmath56 . \\label{factor}\\ ] ] where the @xmath57function expresses the constraint that the sum of weights is equal to the total number of particles .    in",
    "what follows we evaluate this expression first by making further assumptions about the shape of @xmath54 and @xmath53 , and afterwards in the general case using the characteristic function , related to the probability distribution .",
    "the definitions of cumulants and of the characteristic function can be found in any text book on statistics , for instance @xcite .",
    "we start with the integral @xmath58 and introduce the fourier representation for the delta function . @xmath59",
    "changing the order of integration gives @xmath60 @xmath61^{n_e}. \\label{in}\\ ] ] to further continue with the evaluation of @xmath55 we need to make additional approximations .",
    "we assume that @xmath53 is a gaussian distribution with average @xmath62 and rms @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the probability normalization .",
    "its fourier transformation is given by @xmath66 therefore , @xmath67 for large values of @xmath68 , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ factor ] ) can be approximated by an integral @xmath69 if we assume that @xmath52 is also a gaussian with average @xmath68 and standard deviation @xmath70 and inserting eq .",
    "( [ fourier_in ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ integral ] ) gives @xmath71 the integral over @xmath24 can be done analytically @xmath72.\\ ] ] where we neglect in the exponential powers of @xmath73 larger than 2 , after applying the saddle point approximation .",
    "we arrive at the final expression @xmath74 where @xmath75 notice that the above expressions have the correct asymptotic behaviour .",
    "if the particles have no weight , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , then the average number of particles is equal to the average number of entries ( non - thinned particles ) @xmath78 and @xmath79 . on the extreme case of a strongly thinned shower in which all particles are grouped together in a single entry ( @xmath80 ) then @xmath81 and @xmath82 , as expected .",
    "the above result is general and valid for any probability distribution for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the only requirement is the  factorization \" property given in eq .",
    "( [ factor ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ in ] ) , we introduce the characteristic function for the probability distribution @xmath53 , @xmath83 which , in general can be written as @xmath84 = e^{i g(k)},\\ ] ] where the coefficients of the expansion of @xmath85 are related to the cumulants of the distribution of @xmath53 .",
