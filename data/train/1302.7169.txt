    "the last decade has seen a great interest in spin qubits hosted in semiconductor quantum dots , motivated by the prospects of easy scalability , weak coupling to external perturbations , and flexible tunability.@xcite experimental advance has been substantial in the past years , and essential operations including qubit initialization , manipulation , and readout have been convincingly demonstrated.@xcite this progress is not only exciting in the context of quantum computation and information , but it also provides a unique platform for studying fundamental quantum properties of nanoscale systems .",
    "ongoing effort is therefore directed at improving the quality of the spin qubits , mainly by trying to reduce qubit dephasing@xcite and increase the measurement fidelity.@xcite    a common method to read out a quantum dot spin qubit relies on the so - called pauli spin blockade:@xcite a double quantum dot is tuned to a @xmath0 charge state , meaning that each dot contains exactly one excess electron,@xcite and two of the four resulting @xmath0 spin states are used as a qubit basis .",
    "after qubit manipulation , the double dot potential is tilted such that a @xmath1 charge state becomes the two - electron ground state . for not too strong tilting , the only accessible @xmath1 state is a spin singlet , which makes the @xmath2 charge relaxation spin - selective .",
    "if the two qubit basis states contain a different spin - singlet component , then one can use charge detection to measure the qubit s final state before tilting , either by doing transport measurements coupling the doubly occupied dot strongly to an outgoing lead,@xcite or by detecting the charge state with a nearby charge sensor.@xcite    the accuracy of such a readout depends crucially on the effectiveness of the spin blockade : any leakage out of the blocked triplet states reduces the readout visibility and thereby distorts the measurement.@xcite a detailed understanding of the spin - flip relaxation responsible for such triplet leakage is thus essential in the context of spin qubit measurement .",
    "most existing theoretical work along these lines was done for _ single - dot _ spin relaxation@xcite or consists of numerical studies of the relaxation rates.@xcite a thorough analytical study of interdot spin - flip charge relaxation in double quantum dots is still missing .    here",
    ", we study in detail the @xmath0 triplet to @xmath1 singlet decay rate for a lateral double quantum dot .",
    "we investigate two spin - mixing mechanisms which provide a coupling between the otherwise orthogonal states : ( i ) for small externally applied magnetic fields the coupling is believed to be dominated by the effective magnetic field gradient over the two dots caused by the hyperfine coupling of the electron spins to the randomly fluctuating nuclear spins in the host material.@xcite ( ii ) at larger fields , this coupling is suppressed for the two polarized triplet states for which spin - orbit interaction takes over as dominating spin - mixing mechanism.@xcite the second ingredient necessary for a finite leakage rate is the dissipation of the energy difference @xmath3 between the initial @xmath0 triplet and final @xmath1 singlet state , which we assume to be provided by the coupling to acoustical phonons in the host material .",
    "we derive the function @xmath4 for this specific charge transition , which gives the probability that the transition is accompanied by the dissipation of energy @xmath3 by a single phonon ( alternatively one could call this function the effective phonon density of states for the charge transition ) .",
    "we include the contribution from piezoelectric as well as deformation potential electron - phonon coupling , and we find that the piezoelectric contribution to @xmath4 is linear at low energies and @xmath5 at high energies , whereas the coupling to the deformation potential leads to a contribution @xmath6 for low energies and @xmath7 for high energies .",
    "we finally evaluate explicit relaxation rates using parameters of the experiment of ref .  .",
    "we find a decay rate @xmath8  mhz , which agrees with experimental observations.@xcite    our results are not only relevant for spin qubit readout . in ref .",
    "it was suggested that the spin - orbit coupling of the @xmath0 triplet and @xmath1 singlet states could also be utilized to drive off - resonant microwave - stimulated raman transitions within the @xmath0 space . in that case transitions between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states",
    "would contribute to qubit dephasing , and a detailed understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these transitions would be essential in this context as well .",

    "we see that a large size ratio @xmath189 suppresses the relaxation efficiently : for widely separated dots the overlap of the two single - dot wave functions becomes exponentially small , and this suppresses the matrix element @xmath64 . in the limit of strongly overlapping wave functions ,",

    "could thus enhance or counteract the spin - flip tunneling enabled by spin - orbit interaction .",
    "one word of caution is however required here : if the field gradients are caused by the effective hyperfine fields , then the final state @xmath233 in ( [ eq : fgr2 ] ) is _ different _ for a spin - orbit and a hyperfine mediated transition .",
    "indeed , in the course of hyperfine induced spin - flip tunneling the spin of one of the nuclei is raised by @xmath234 , which does not happen during a spin - orbit mediated transition . in that case one",

    "we first derived an effective phonon density of states @xmath4 for this charge transition , and found that at small energies @xmath184 is linear in energy , @xmath236 , and dominated by the piezoelectric electron - phonon coupling , whereas at large energies the @xmath184 is dominated by the coupling to the deformation potential and is @xmath7 .",
    "then , we investigated two different spin - mixing mechanisms coupling the spin triplet and singlet states : a magnetic field gradient over the double dot ( relevant at low external magnetic field ) and spin - orbit interaction ( relevant at high field ) .",
    "we showed how the spin - orbit - mediated coupling depends on the device geometry as well as on the in - plane direction of the applied magnetic field .",
