    "in light of our new observations and analysis , we revisit the interpretation of the cygnus  x-1 outflow . we have put tighter and more physically - motivated limits on the pre - shock velocity ( the shock velocity measured in the lab frame ; @xmath11 ) , pre - shock density ( @xmath12 ) , and power needed to drive the shockwave ( @xmath13 ; table  [ table : results ] ) compared to previous work @xcite . using these new constraints",
    ", we explore the source of power for the shockwave in this section .",
    "first , the near perfect alignment between the small - scale radio jet and large - scale shockwave , which are both at a position angle @xmath14 , leads us to first investigate the case where the shockwave is driven exclusively by the bh jet .",
    "for comparison to models and other ( xrb and agn ) observations , we calculate the efficiency at which accreted power is converted to other forms of power .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is commonly used to trace the accretion rate : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the conversion efficiency ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the total power in the accretion process is not only radiated ; some ( potentially a large fraction ) is advected or is ejected in a jet or disk wind ( the kinetic power ) .",
    "therefore , we more explicity specify how the accretion power , @xmath17 , can be transformed into other forms of power ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and where the latter relation is for a non - spinning bh . in this representation , @xmath20 represents the fraction of rest - mass energy liberated by the accretion process , which scales with the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit and is fundamental to the spacetime metric . for a non - spinning ( schwarzschild ) bh , @xmath21 but it can be as high as @xmath22 for a rapidly spinning ( kerr ) bh .",
    "the relative values of @xmath23 , @xmath9 , @xmath24 depend on the accretion flow solution . in the case of cygnus  x-1 , we estimate @xmath25 using the 0.1  ",
    "200  kev hard state luminosity , @xmath26  erg  s@xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is @xmath27 for a 14.8  m@xmath28 bh .",
    "we adopt the above value for @xmath25 with a couple of caveats .",
    "first , we do not include the recently observed mev spectral tail in @xmath25 , which would only be a small correction ( but is important for understanding jet physics ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , we have made no duty cycle correction to the x - ray bolometric luminosity because only a very small correction is implied ( much smaller than the uncertainties in the other relevant parameters ) : cygnus x-1 has spent most of the time ( @xmath29 per cent ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in approximately the last two decades in this state and this correction is likely much smaller than long - term ( over thousands of years ) changes in the accretion rate .",
    "next , we can use these constraints with the parameterization above to explore the kinetic efficiency , which is the jet efficiency if the jet is driving the outflow ( i.e. @xmath30 ) .",
    "cygnus  x-1 completes a small track in the hardness - intensity diagram in intermediate states , indicating that it never strays too far from the transition between its intermediate soft and hard states ( @xmath31 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) like low - mass xrbs typically do ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this regime ,",
    "if the accretion flow is characterized by an advection - dominated accretion flow , the advection efficiency is expected to be small ( @xmath32 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is the efficiency we assume below . in its soft state ,",
    "the radio emission drops dramatically ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that the jet has been mostly quenched @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity increases by factors of a few , making @xmath33 . in its hard state , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are approximately equivalent , meaning that @xmath36 .",
    "this corresponds to an average accretion rate of @xmath37  m@xmath28  yr@xmath0 . in this most likely case",
    ", there is enough kinetic power in the jet to power the outflow .",
    "however , we can not rule out a large range of outflow powers with high significance .",
    "in particular , considering up to the @xmath38 limit gives @xmath39 .",
    "such a large jump in the accretion power needed to fuel the jet at the state transition could not be hidden in bolometric corrections @xcite , and increasing the advection efficiency only exacerbates the problem .",
    "this would imply that there is not enough accretion energy to power the outflow via the jet unless @xmath40 . in this case",
    ", the jet would have to extract considerable amounts of rotational energy from the bh @xcite .",
    "this would support the claim that cygnus  x-1 is rapidly spinning @xcite .",
    "this would also provide support for the claim that the jet power is higher for more rapidly rotating bhs based on an observed correlation between the peak radio fluxes of xrbs and the spins fitted from disk continuum modeling @xcite .",
    "however , other studies of ballistic jet ejections and radio / x - ray correlations from low / hard state bhs do not find strong effects of bh spin @xcite .",
    "these contradictory studies together with our measurements lead us to conclude that we have no reason to favor the idea that the high efficiency of jet production is due to different values of the bh spin .",
    "the bh jet can also be placed in the context of the standard model for bh jets , which may not be complete . @xcite carried out a detailed comparison of the observed jet power to that estimated from the canonical model for flat radio emission from jet cores @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a dramatic difference between the small- and large - scale jet power estimates ( observed , large - scale jet power is too large ) and could only reconcile them through some combination of non - standard factors : a small filling factor , a mass - loaded jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a contribution of other sources of power to the large - scale shockwave ( see sections [ section : supernova ] and [ section : ostar ] ) , and/or a some fundamental issue with the jet model itself .",
    "constructing even a small , comparative sample of sources to place this analysis in context is challenging .",
    "there are only a couple of other sources in the milky way with well - measured , large - scale shockwaves : circinus  x-1 and ss  433 , but the large - scale features have a considerably different morphology from that of cygnus  x-1 . instead of cygnus  x-1 s one - sided , parsec - scale bow shock ,",
    "these two systems are embedded in their natal supernova remnants , making them unusually young xrbs ( a few @xmath41  yr for circinus  x-1  @xcite and @xmath42  yr for ss  433  e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these binaries have dual , parsec - scale termination shocks of the bipolar jets referred to as  ears \" for ss  433 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or  caps \" @xcite .",
    "the implied kinetic power of the jets in both systems is enormous : @xmath43  erg  s@xmath0 for ss  433 @xcite and @xmath44  ",
    "@xmath45  erg  s@xmath0 for circinus  x-1 @xcite but could be as high as @xmath43  erg  s@xmath0 ( based on what could be a protrusion of the jet on the south side of the supernova remnant ; * ? ? ?",
    "these two systems also have considerably different accretion flows compared to cygnus  x-1 s well - characterized bh binary wind - fed system , which has spent most of the time in the last few decades in the hard state where a steady jet is seen @xcite and expected to be found @xcite .",
    "ss  433 appears to have a supercritical , heavily extincted accretion flow with considerable uv emission and strong winds surrounding what is a likely but not a securely determined @xmath46  m@xmath28 bh @xcite .",
    "this system may more closely resemble the population of ultra - luminous x - ray sources seen in nearby galaxies @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "circinus x-1 is a confirmed neutron star @xcite xrb in a highly eccentric orbit with very strong variability , showing both z- and atoll - like behavior ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in its very low state ,",
    "the system does exhibit a steady jet @xcite .",
    "the fact that it is not easily classified with the rest of the neutron star binary population can now be attributed to the fact that it is in a unique evolutionary phase as the youngest neutron star xrb in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "these qualitative differences can bring about considerable quantitative systematic uncertainties in @xmath23 and @xmath9 , and , therefore , @xmath47 ( these could change by an order of magnitude or more between states because the variability is so strong ) .",
    "because @xmath47 is so poorly constrained , we choose not to try to estimate it to compare to cygnus x-1 .",
    "we discuss some of these issues in the context of cygnus x-1 in section [ section : future ] .",
    "finally , the cygnus x-1 jet may also be better understood when comparing our results to samples of agn where the total jet power can be measured ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such comparisons could be problematic because @xmath48 does not provide a good estimate for @xmath17 in supermassive bhs as it does for xrbs @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite and @xcite both found the estimates of the scaled jet power compared to the accretion power for cygnus  x-1 to be consistent with those of their agn samples , albeit with large uncertainties comparable to the uncertainties in the jet power that we find in this work .",
    "in contrast , @xcite claimed to find a discrepancy between the jet and wind - scaling correlations with the bolometric luminosity and the values found for cygnus x-1 using different scaling relations .    in the next two subsections , we consider other possible sources for the observed shockwave .",
    "we consider whether the data suggest that this shockwave could be the remnant of the supernova that created the cygnus  x-1 bh . in this case , the distance from cygnus x-1 to the shockwave and the limits on the velocity imply that the shockwave would likely be near the transition of the sedov - taylor @xcite and  snow - plough \" phases .",
    "given our constraints on the density ( @xmath49  @xmath2 ) , size ( @xmath50    9  pc ) , and velocity ( @xmath51  km  s@xmath0 ) of the shockwave ( we do not expect that our limits on these three parameters are strongly model - dependent ) , the upper limit on the supernova energy in these phases is @xmath52  erg ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "because @xmath53 is sensitive to @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and the shockwave is asymmetric and possibly inclined , the uncertainty in this upper limit is approximately a factor of 2    3 .",
    "nevertheless , this upper limit is approximately an order of magnitude fainter than the typical supernova energy of @xmath56  erg ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this leads us to consider a couple possibilities .",
    "first , the shockwave could be the remnant of a low - energy explosion , where most of the mass was promptly swallowed by the bh , also explaining the low proper motion of the binary .",
    "this has already been suggested by @xcite , but in a different context before the shockwave had been discovered .",
    "@xcite considered the kinematics of the entire region including the proper motion of cygnus  x-1 relative to the nearby cyg ob3 association .",
    "they suggested that the bh progenitor , a @xmath57  m@xmath28 star , exploded within the nearby h  ii region a few million years ago , producing a low - energy shockwave in the h  ii region or none at all .",
    "assuming , instead , that the current young ( a few @xmath58  yr ) shockwave is the low - energy explosion that they suggest , could explain the unusual , but not implausible morphology ( e.g. n132d ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the lack of unusual metal abundance patterns ( e.g. oxygen , nitrogen , sulfur ) expected for typical supernovae . since supernova blastwaves can sometimes have lower energies as constrained above ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this scenario remains an intriguing possibility .",
    "another simpler possibility is that this could be a supernova remnant unrelated to cygnus  x-1 , seen in chance projection at a larger distance .",
    "the shockwave would be much more extended in this case , bringing the required energy more in line with a typical supernova energy .",
    "as this is close to a nearby star - forming region , cyg  ob3 , perhaps another supernova occurred behind cygnus  x-1 in the more distant past .",
    "we can not rule out this possibility .",
    "however , given the excellent alignment with the bh jet , the unusual morphology , and the lack of unusual abundance patterns as stated above , the simplest , most likely explanation is that the shockwave is associated with cygnus  x-1 .",
    "the o - star companion in the binary can have a strong effect on the ism and shockwave near cygnus  x-1 .",
    "first , the photoionizing spectrum could have a large impact on the ism ahead of and behind the shockwave .",
    "given that the strmgren sphere of the o - star is @xmath59  pc using the limits on the pre - shock density we measure , the o - star should photoionize the gas throughout this entire shocked region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our model comparisons to the data , which do take pre - photoionization into account , provide some insight here .",
    "while neither the data nor the models are detailed enough to make precise statements concerning the level of ionizing flux at the shock front and they do not enable us to rule out any of the scenarios we consider , we do find that the shock models consistently prefer a relatively low fractional ionizing o - star flux .",
    "the data are almost always best - fit with the @xmath60 models ( see table  [ table : model_params ] ) .",
    "this is puzzling and could be explained by a number of possibilities : there is considerable attenuation of ionizing radiation ( e.g. by dust ) in between the o - star and the shockwave , the shockwave is considerably inclined to the line of sight , the shockwave is unassociated with cygnus  x-1 , or limitations of the one dimensional mappings  iii shock models are the cause of this discrepancy .",
    "we also consider the role of the o - star wind .",
    "we use the measured wind mass - loss rate ( @xmath61  m@xmath6  yr@xmath0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the measured characteristics of the companion star in cygnus  x-1 ( @xmath62  kk , log  @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) together with a model of theoretical mass loss rates of isolated o- and b - stars @xcite .",
    "this model includes a wind efficiency / performance number , @xmath16 , that describes the fraction of the momentum of the radiation that is transferred to the ions in the wind . for these input values , @xmath65    0.2 , implying a spherical wind power of @xmath66  erg  s@xmath0 .",
    "unless the wind is somehow focused , @xmath67 per cent of the wind power is directed toward the shockwave .",
    "this is consistent with the measured power needed to drive the shockwave , suggesting that the o - star could be an important driving force behind the shockwave .    to investigate the possibility of o - star winds driving the shock",
    ", we consider a well - known , extreme example of a system with o - star wind - blown shocks , eta carina . in an outburst over",
    "100 years ago , which could have been confused for a supernova explosion @xcite , this binary double o - star has driven powerful bipolar outflows @xcite .",
    "multiple observations have revealed high outflow velocities of thousands of kilometers per second , well beyond the escape velocity of the system @xcite .",
    "various wind models over the past couple of decades have attempted to reproduce the powerful , bipolar outflows of eta carina ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with varying degrees of success",
    ". however , no model yet exists to take into account the unique effects of a bh companion instead , as in the case of cygnus  x-1 .",
    "while we have concluded that a supernova origin for the outflow is unlikely , we have found that the o - star wind and bh jet both remain strong possibilities and likely work together to create the outflow and influence the state of the gas on both sides of the shock front .",
    "for instance , recent simulations clearly show how the o - star wind can be strongly affected by the dynamics of the gas very near the bh @xcite .",
    "additional thermal heating , photoionization , bulk gas motions , clumping , and additonal turbulence likely present in a bh binary system may work to alter outflows .",
    "in addition , the winds of the previous and current o - stars in the binary can produce a variable density profile in the nearby ism , whereas the mappings  iii shock models assume a uniform density ism .",
    "detailed three dimensional models are needed that take into account these effects and translate how they affect large - scale outflows .",
    "in addition , a better , more robust determination of the large - scale outflow power , including a more robust lower limit on the outflow velocity , would help to constrain the outflow .",
    "however , this is a challenging prospect because of considerable observational and theoretical hurdles that add large uncertainties :    * if the jet is driving the outflow , it could be injecting most of its kinetic power in different modes ( steady versus discrete jet ejections ) . for instance , defining @xmath68 is problematic if most of the accreted mass is lost in a wind instead of a jet or if most of the injected energy in the jets is during a short - lived powerful outburst where the @xmath23 , @xmath9 , or @xmath24 could vary radically .",
    "there is not much evidence for this in the last few decades while cygnus  x-1 has been well - monitored , but this is only a small fraction of the lifetime of the bh .",
    "the upper limit on the velocity ( @xmath69  km  s@xmath0 ) implies that the outflow was launched @xmath70  yr ago . * how energy is injected into large - scale lobes and shockwaves",
    "may not be fully understood .",
    "we may be considerably underestimating ( @xmath71 ) how much energy is needed to create the large - scale lobe north of cygnus  x-1 , which is analyzed similarly to radio lobes in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "* despite the complexity of the 1-d shock models we employ that have been developed over many decades , the implementation of future 3-d simulations with more physical processes that are tracked and understood from the launching point to the large - scale outflow could considerably affect our interpretation and measurements .",
    "this includes developing a better understanding how winds and jets might couple together to drive large - scale outflows .",
    "such simulations are challenging to develop and much more computationally expensive to run than the tens of thousands of computer hours for the 1-d shock models we used . *",
    "much of the uncertainty in the outflow power arises from the our inability to constrain many of the shock model parameters tracing properties of the shock and ism , most of which we marginalized over ( see table  [ table : model_params ] ) : inclination ( and distance from cygnus  x-1 ) , density , velocity , magnetic field strength , abundance , and o - star ionizing flux .",
    "unfortunately , placing improved observational constraints on these parameters is very difficult and expensive in terms of the observing time required .",
    "one solution could be to search for similar shockwaves around other xrbs , especially in cases where the stellar companion would not have a strong wind .",
    "if other systems with large - scale shockwaves are found , this methodology could be applied again to determine the outflow power to within a factor of a few .",
    "however , this could be problematic for a couple reasons . first",
    ", if the shockwave north of cygnus  x-1 is mostly powered by the o - star wind , then such shockwaves may not exist in most cases .",
    "second , such shockwaves would exist at a range of random ages . as noted in section [ section : models ] , our data are heavily constrained by models to the left of the cooling line where the temperature is low enough that low ionization species are observable . however , a large fraction of the optical radiative output of the shockwaves are in emission lines .",
    "this implies that such shockwaves may not be observable via optical lines for most of their lifetimes because the cooling time is so short .",
    "however , the shock could be re - energized with the continuous injection of energy by the bh jet , extending the cooling time . in any case , we conclude that making substantial progress in firmly determining and better constraining the source of this and other similar outflows beyond initial , rough , simple estimates may require large strides in theoretical understanding and observational capabilities .",
    "we have presented an in - depth analysis of the parsec - scale outflow of cygnus x-1 by comparing multiwavelength observations to detailed shock models .",
    "we place physically - motivated results on the shock velocity , the pre - shock density , and the jet power . with these new results ,",
    "we discuss the complicated nature of the outflow and the list some possibilities for the source of the outflow power .",
    "we find that , unless the shockwave was formed in an unusual supernova explosion , it is unlikely to be a supernova remnant .",
    "the morphological alignment to the relativistic radio jet suggests that it plays an important or central role in driving the shockwave .",
    "however , the o - star could also play an important role in creating a wind - blown bubble producing the large - scale shock .",
    "we conclude that a significantly better characterization of the outflow appears to be a daunting task because it requires much better constraints on multiple observational and theoretical systematic uncertainties .",
