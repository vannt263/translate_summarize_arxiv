    "integrodifferential equations with nonlocal terms of the convolution type often arise in applications such as mechanics of heterogeneous media , the theory of viscoelasticity , thermal physics , kinetic theory of gases and others .",
    "for example , it was rigorously proved that in the case of heterogeneous two - phase medium , consisting of viscous fluid and elastic inclusions , the effective equation is integro - differential , and the corresponding convolution kernel is a finite of infinite sum of decreasing exponential functions .    if the viscosity of the liquid is small ( big ) , the effective equation does contain ( does not contain ) the third order terms corresponding to kelvin - voigh friction , see @xcite . in the theory of viscoelasticity , it is a common practice to approximate the relaxation kernels by the sum of exponents .    in thermal physics ,",
    "laws of heat conduction with an integral memory are studied in many papers ; note among them @xcite .",
    "the presence of integral memory in the law of heat conduction might lead to the appearance of a thermal front which moves at a finite speed .",
    "this makes an important difference with the heat equation whose solution propagates at infinite speed .    in this paper",
    ", we give an outline of the results on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to these systems and consider the problem of controllability .",
    "in this article , we consider the problem of non controllability of a system governed by the integrodifferential equation @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 hereinafter @xmath4 is a bounded domain , @xmath5 is an arbitrary twice continuously differentiable function such that @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a control supported ( in @xmath8 ) on @xmath9 .",
    "the kernel @xmath5 can be represented , for example , as a sum of decreasing exponential functions : @xmath10 @xmath11 , @xmath12 are given positive constants .",
    "for brevity , we write @xmath13 and @xmath14 instead of @xmath15 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "this also means that @xmath13 , @xmath14 are functions of @xmath16 with values in some suitable space .",
    "the goal of the control is to drive this mechanical system to rest in a finite time .",
    "we say that the system ( [ 1])([3 ] ) is _ controllable to rest _ if for every initial condition @xmath17 we can find a control @xmath18 with compact support ( in @xmath16 ) such that the corresponding solution @xmath19 of the problem ( [ 1])([3 ] ) has a compact support ( in @xmath16 ) .",
    "conversely , the system is _ uncontrollable to rest _ if there is the initial condition @xmath17 such that for every control @xmath18 ( @xmath18 is in the suitable class of functions ) the corresponding solution does not have compact support ( in @xmath16 ) .    in this article",
    ", we prove that the system governed by two - dimensional gurtin - pipkin equation is uncontrollable to rest if the distributed control is supported on the subdomain which is properly contained in arbitrary bounded domain with a smooth boundary .",
    "this result is some generalization of the analogous theorem in @xcite devoted to the similar one - dimensional problem .",
    "the method used in the paper can also apply to the case where the dimension of @xmath9 is greater than 2 .",
    "it will be discussed in section 6 .",
    "the presence of nonlocal terms of the convolution type in the equations and systems leads to a number of interesting qualitative effects that are not observed in the case of differential equations and systems of equations .",
    "for instance , the systems of this type exhibit the properties of both parabolic and hyperbolic equations . in spectral problems for such equations and systems the spectrum is composed of two parts : real and complex .",
    "the former one corresponds to the energy dissipation in the heat equation ; the later corresponds to vibrations .",
    "such equations can be solved by means of the method similar to the fourier method .",
    "in addition , systems of this type are usually uncontrollable to rest , if we apply boundary control or control which is distributed on the part of the domain . here",
    "we recall the well - known work @xcite that deals with the equation of the vibration of a string . as was proved in this work ,",
    "if we apply the control to the end of the string , then the system can be driven to rest .",
    "the author used the so - called moment method .",
    "the mentioned results were generalized to the multidimensional case in @xcite .    at the same time , if we use the control distributed on the whole domain then integral terms of the convolution type `` facilitate '' the process of control . in this case , the control time is significantly reduced .",
    "it should be noted that the spectral method proposed in @xcite can be successfully adapted to the case of systems with nonlocal terms of convolution type , see @xcite .",
    "the uncontrollability mentioned above was justified in @xcite for one - dimensional systems similar to ( [ 1 ] ) . in most cases the property of controllability to rest is not observed .",
    "for example , in @xcite it was proved that a solution to the heat equation with memory can not be driven to rest in a finite time if some auxiliary function has roots .",
    "this result is valid both for boundary and distributed control .",
    "moreover , the case of distributed control can be reduced to the case of boundary control . in our paper , we obtain similar results for the case of two - dimensional domains .",
    "we should also mention the work @xcite , where the boundary non controllability was justified for the heat equation with memory .",
    "positive results on controllability of a one - dimensional wave equation with memory were obtained in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this equation can be driven to rest by applying a bounded distributed control . in this case , the kernel of the integral term in the equation is the sum of @xmath20 decreasing exponential functions .",
    "problems similar to ( [ 1])([3 ] ) for integrodifferential equations were widely studied in the existing literature .",
    "equation ( [ 1 ] ) was originally derived in @xcite .",
    "the questions of solvability and asymptotic behavior of solutions for equations of this type were investigated for example in @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was proved that the energy for some dissipative system decays polynomially , when the memory kernel decays exponentially .",
    "problems of solvability of system ( [ 1])([3 ] ) were considered in @xcite .",
    "it was proved that a solution belongs to some sobolev space on the semi - axis ( in @xmath16 ) if the kernel @xmath5 is the sum of exponential functions , each of them tends to zero as @xmath21 .",
    "interesting explicit formulas for the solution of ( [ 1])([3 ] ) were obtained in @xcite under the assumption that the kernel @xmath5 is also the sum of decreasing exponential functions .",
    "it follows from these formulas that solutions tend to zero when @xmath21 . in all these works",
    "it is supposed that the kernels of integral terms in the studied equations are non increasing functions .",
    "let @xmath22 be an operator acting on a space @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a bounded domain with boundary of class @xmath25 .",
    "we consider now the control function @xmath26 and the initial condition @xmath27 .    * definition 1 .",
    "* the function @xmath28 is the solution of the problem ( [ 1])([3 ] ) if @xmath13 satisfies the equation ( [ 1 ] ) and initial condition ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "we note that the boundary condition ( [ 3 ] ) makes sense because for any @xmath29 @xmath13 is a continuous ( in @xmath30 ) function .",
    "there are several theorems of existence and uniqueness dedicated to the problem ( [ 1])([3 ] ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us denote @xmath31 as the linear space of the laplace transforms of elements of @xmath32 with compact support distributed on @xmath33 .",
    "it is a well known fact that @xmath34 if and only if it is an entire function such that    \\1 ) there are real numbers @xmath35 and @xmath36 such that @xmath37 .",
    "note that @xmath35 and @xmath36 depend on @xmath38 .",
    "\\2 ) @xmath39 .",
    "now we consider an auxiliary boundary - value problem @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43    in this problem for each @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath46 .    * definition 2 . *",
    "@xmath47 is the solution of the problem ( [ 4])([6 ] ) if @xmath13 satisfies the equation ( [ 4 ] ) , initial condition ( [ 5 ] ) and the boundary condition ( [ 6 ] ) ( in the sense of the trace ) .",
    "suppose there is a solution to the problem ( [ 4])([6 ] ) .",
    "we multiply ( in the sense of the inner product in @xmath48 both parts of ( [ 4 ] ) by the function @xmath49 such that @xmath50 .",
    "hereinafter @xmath51 is a normal vector to the domain boundary @xmath52 .",
    "after that , using green s formula we replace the operator @xmath53 from @xmath13 to @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 is the inner product in @xmath56 .",
    "the orthonormalized system of eigenvectors of @xmath53 are the functions @xmath57 which in polar coordinates @xmath58 , @xmath59 have the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 are bessel functions , @xmath62 are positive roots of @xmath61 .",
    "it is a well - known fact that this system is a basis for @xmath56 .",
    "we substitute @xmath63 in ( [ 7 ] ) . then using the notation @xmath64 we obtain @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "if we use polar coordinates we have @xmath67    let us make the laplace transformation for both parts of ( [ 8 ] ) and express @xmath68 : @xmath69    * lemma 1 . *",
    "if in the problem ( [ 4])([6 ] ) @xmath70 has at least one root @xmath71 in the domain of holomorphism ( we require that this domain exists ) then controllability to rest is impossible ; that is , there exists the initial condition @xmath72 such that for any @xmath44 and for every control @xmath46 the corresponding solution does not have compact support ( in t ) .",
    "* let us use the polar coordinates in the integral of the equality ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "then the equality ( [ 9 ] ) takes the form : @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "the system of functions @xmath75 is an orthogonal basis in @xmath76 .",
    "thus we can expand @xmath77 where @xmath78 hence we obtain @xmath79    we note that if the system is controllable to rest then @xmath80 , @xmath81 have compact support .",
    "thus @xmath68 and @xmath82 are in @xmath31 .",
    "as it follows from the definition of @xmath31 , @xmath68 is an entire function then it can not have singularities at the roots of the denominator @xmath83 .",
    "thus the control function @xmath82 has to satisfy the following equalities : @xmath84 when @xmath85 is a root of the equation @xmath86 .",
    "as @xmath87 then ( [ 12 ] ) can be rewritten as follows @xmath88    we note that equalities ( [ 12.1 ] ) can be presented in the following form : @xmath89 the latter equalities are the so - called moment problem .",
    "we record now index @xmath90 .",
    "let @xmath90 , for example , be equal to @xmath91 and @xmath92 changes from @xmath91 to @xmath93 .",
    "we get the subsystem of equalities for values of the function @xmath94 at such points @xmath95 that @xmath96 : @xmath97 we note that @xmath70 has a root @xmath71 ( if @xmath5 is a series of decreasing exponentials then @xmath70 has a countable number of roots , see @xcite ) . then applying methods used in @xcite ( in which rouche s theorem was used )",
    "we can prove that there exists a sequence @xmath98 of zeros of @xmath99 and it is important that this sequence is convergent to the non - zero complex number .",
    "let us choose @xmath100 . hence @xmath101 .",
    "as the sequence of zeros is convergent and @xmath102 is an entire function , then @xmath103 .",
    "we get that for any @xmath92 all @xmath104 have to be zero .",
    "but we can always take some of them as non - zero numbers .",
    "thus we come to the conclusion that there exists such initial condition @xmath17 that for any control function @xmath105 controllability to rest is impossible .",
    "lemma is proved .",
    "we consider the problem ( [ 1])([3 ] ) .",
    "the following theorem is the main result of this article",
    ".    * theorem . *",
    "if the control function @xmath106 in the equation ( [ 1 ] ) has compact support ( in @xmath30 ) on @xmath9 and @xmath70 has at least one root @xmath71 in the domain of holomorphism then controllability to rest is impossible ; that is , there exists the initial condition @xmath27 such that for any @xmath44 and for every control @xmath106 ( with compact support on @xmath9 ) the corresponding solution does not have compact support ( in t ) .",
    "* let @xmath7 at each time @xmath107 be an arbitrary function in @xmath108 with compact support @xmath109 .",
    "as support of u is a closed and bounded set then we can consider a circle @xmath110 which is properly contained in @xmath9 and does not intersect @xmath109 ( see figure 1 ) . at each time",
    "@xmath107 the solution @xmath111 .",
    "we restrict the solution @xmath13 to @xmath110 ( in this case @xmath112 ) and consider a new initial boundary - value problem on @xmath110 . in this problem",
    "the boundary condition is equal to the restriction ( in the sense of the trace theorem ) of the solution on the boundary of @xmath110 . as @xmath112 this restriction can be computed and at the each time @xmath107 is an element of @xmath113 . we can consider the restriction of the solution to @xmath52 as the control .",
    "thus we obtain the boundary control problem on the circle @xmath110 .",
    "the solution of this problem exists automatically . using the previous lemma we have proved that if controllability to rest of this new problem is impossible then it is impossible , to stop oscillations of the origin problem ( [ 1])([3 ] ) .",
    "the theorem is proved .",
    "to obtain analogous result for gurtin - pipkin equation in the case where the dimension of @xmath9 is greater than 2 , it is necessary to use the orthonormalized system of eigenvectors of @xmath53 defined in @xmath110 , where @xmath110 is a ball .",
    "these eigenvectors , for example in @xmath114 , are constructed by means of spherical harmonics @xmath115 while we use functions @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 in case of two - dimensional domains . using orthogonal property of spherical harmonics @xmath119 on the unit sphere",
    "we expand @xmath120 and after that all steps of the proof remain unchanged ( see proof of the lemma 1 ) .",
    "we choose @xmath121 in present paper as the clearest and evident way to demonstrate the idea of the proof .",
    "most likely , it can be proved that if @xmath122 and the control function does not have compact support properly contained in @xmath9 , then the problem ( [ 1])([3 ] ) is controllable to rest .",
    "we note that if @xmath123 then the equation ( [ 1 ] ) is a classical wave equation and @xmath70 does not have a null , and it is a well - known fact that using a control contained in a subdomain the system is controllable to rest . if @xmath124 , @xmath125 then the equation ( [ 1 ] ) can be reduced to the equation @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 can be considered as a new control .",
    "the latter equation is a damped wave equation .",
    "let us consider the one - dimensional case then , instead of the laplace operator @xmath129 , we write the second derivative @xmath130 : @xmath131 it is proved ( will be published later ) that oscillations of the string governed by the equation ( [ 17 ] ) ( let @xmath132 ) can be stopped if we apply the control to the end of the string , the second end being fixed .",
    "apparently , using this fact it can be proved ( but it is not proved ) , that by means of a control @xmath133 contained in a subsegment ( in @xmath134 ) , the system is also controllable to rest .    finally , we also note a link between stability and controllability for the one - dimensional case . if we consider equation @xmath135 where @xmath136 is convolution and @xmath137 , then solutions of this equation are stable if the parameter @xmath138 $ ] , and unstable if @xmath139 or @xmath140 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath141 or @xmath142 then the system is controllable to rest .",
    "in this article , we have proved that the system governed by the two - dimensional gurtin - pipkin equation is uncontrollable to rest if the distributed control is supported on the subdomain which is properly contained in arbitrary bounded domain with a smooth boundary . in this case , the memory kernel is a twice continuously differentiable function , such that its laplace transformation has at least one non - zero root .",
