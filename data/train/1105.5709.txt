    "the two - dimensional ising model is one of the most well - studied models in statistical mechanics . given a discrete planar domain @xmath0 ( a bounded subset of the square grid ) , the ising model in @xmath0 can be viewed either as a random assignment of spins to the _ faces _ of @xmath0 , or a random collection of edges of @xmath0 , with an edge drawn between each pair of faces having different spins .",
    "the partition function of the model is given by @xmath1 \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\sum\\limits_{s\\in{\\mathrm{conf}}({\\omega^{\\delta } } ) } x^{|s|},\\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath2 denotes the set of faces of @xmath0 and @xmath3 is the set of subgraphs @xmath4 of @xmath0 such that all vertices of @xmath0 have even degrees in @xmath4 .",
    "we refer the reader to section  [ sec : notations ] for a more detailed discussion and notation",
    ". we will be interested in the properties of the model at the critical temperature @xmath5 , which corresponds to @xmath6 .",
    "this value of @xmath7 will be fixed throughout the paper .",
    "discrete holomorphic observables , also called holomorphic fermions or fermionic observables , were proposed by smirnov in  @xcite as a tool to study the critical ising model , although similar objects appeared earlier in  @xcite and  @xcite without discussing corresponding boundary value problems .",
    "since then , these observables proved to be very useful for a rigorous analysis of the planar ising model at criticality in the scaling limit when @xmath0 approximates some continuous domain @xmath8 as the lattice mesh @xmath9 tends to zero .",
    "recall that smirnov s fermionic observable is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the set of edge subsets @xmath4 , such that @xmath4 can be decomposed into a disjoint collection of loops and a simple lattice path @xmath12 connecting a boundary edge @xmath13 to the midpoint @xmath14 of an inner edge @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is the winding number of  @xmath12 ; and @xmath17 denotes the orientation of the outgoing boundary edge @xmath13 . with this definition",
    ", the observable has been shown to be discrete holomorphic and satisfy riemann - type boundary conditions @xmath18 this led to a proof of its convergence to a conformally covariant scaling limit @xcite .",
    "this result has been the main ingredient of the recent progress in rigorous understanding of conformal invariance in the critical two - dimensional ising model .",
    "the martingale property of @xmath19 ( see further details in  @xcite ) allows one to prove convergence of the ising interfaces to the chordal schramm s @xmath20 curves . using a slightly different version of this observable",
    ", hongler and smirnov  @xcite were able to compute the scaling limit of the energy density in the critical ising model on the square grid , including the lattice dependent constant before the conformally covariant factor .",
    "this result was later extended to all correlations of the energy density field and certain boundary spin correlations @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", similar observables proved to be very useful in the analysis of the random cluster ( fortuin - kasteleyn ) representation of the critical ising model  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown by beffara and duminil - copin  @xcite that they can be used to give a short proof of criticality of the ising model at the self - dual point .",
    "many of these results generalize beyond the case of square grid approximations .",
    "thus , convergence of fermionic observables has been proven for isoradial lattices @xcite , which reappeared in the connection with the critical ising model in the paper of mercat  @xcite .",
    "this proved the universality phenomenon , i.e. , the fact that a microscopic structure of the lattice does not affect macroscopic properties of the scaling limit .",
    "moreover , discrete complex analysis technique developed in @xcite and  @xcite provides a general framework for such universal proofs .    on the other hand , one of the most natural questions about the ising model  the rigorous proof of conformal covariance of spin correlations in the scaling limit",
    " remained out of reach until recently .",
    "the goal of the present work is to introduce a new tool ",
    "spinor holomorphic observables  that allows to attack this problem . in particular , we prove convergence of ratios of spin correlations corresponding to different boundary conditions to conformally invariant limits . in a subsequent joint paper with clment hongler @xcite , using a more elaborate version of the spinor observables , we prove conformal covariance of spin correlations themselves .      in this paper",
    "we extend the study of fermionic observables to the case of multiply connected domains . given a double cover @xmath21 of such a domain , we define the observable @xmath22 by @xmath23 where @xmath24 , but the sum is taken over _ the same set of configurations _ as before ; @xmath25 is the number of loops in @xmath4 that do not lift as closed loops to @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the indicator of the event that @xmath12 lifts to @xmath26 as a path running from @xmath13 to @xmath28 ( and not to the other sheet ) , see section  [ sec : observables_limits ] for detailed discussion . in other words",
    ", we plug into ( [ smirnovf ] ) an additional sign that depends on homology class of @xmath4 modulo two .",
    "it is worth to mention that our observables should be closely related to the vector bundle laplacian technique applied to uniform spanning trees and double dimers by kenyon  @xcite , although at the moment we do not know any exact correspondence of that sort .",
    "our main observation is that @xmath29 are discrete holomorphic and satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ eq : rim_bc ] ) , just like smirnov s observable @xmath19 .",
    "the definition implies that @xmath30 , if @xmath31 belong to a fiber of the same point ; hence , we call @xmath32 _ holomorphic spinors_.    to describe the scaling limits of @xmath33 , we will introduce the continuous holomorphic spinors @xmath34 .",
    "roughly speaking , these are fundamental solutions to the continuous riemann boundary value problem ( [ eq : rim_bc ] ) on the double - cover @xmath35 , with a singularity at @xmath13 and the property @xmath36 . postponing precise definitions until section  [ sec : observables_limits ] , we now state our first main result ( see theorem [ thm : mainconv_int_1 ] ) :    suppose that @xmath0 is a sequence of discrete domains of mesh size @xmath37 approximating ( in the sense of carathodory ) a continuous finitely connected domain @xmath8 , and that @xmath38 tends to @xmath39 as @xmath40 .",
    "then there is a sequence of normalizing factors @xmath41 such that @xmath42 uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath8 .",
    "this convergence also holds true up to the `` nice '' parts of the boundary ; moreover , considering ratios of observables corresponding to different @xmath43 s , one can get rid of normalization issues .",
    "we work this out in theorem [ thm : mainconv ]",
    ".    a striking feature of our new observables is their direct relation to spin correlations .",
    "let @xmath0 be a _ simply connected _ domain with @xmath44 punctures , that is , @xmath44 single faces @xmath45 removed , and let @xmath46 be the cover that branches around each of these punctures .",

    ", @xmath80 denotes the ( random ) spin of the component @xmath79 .",
    "further , closely following the route proposed by hongler in  @xcite , we prove a pfaffian formula which generalizes ( [ intratio1 ] ) to the case of @xmath81 boundary change operators ( in other words , `` @xmath82 '' boundary conditions with @xmath81 marked boundary points , see section  [ sec : pfaffian ] ) . for @xmath72 this pfaffian formula ( along with the expressions for @xmath68 )",
    "was previously derived by means of conformal field theory @xcite , whereas we give it a rigorous proof for general @xmath44 both in discrete , and , thanks to the convergence theorem , in continuous settings .",
    "another application of our new observables  @xcite is the proof of convergence of ( multiple ) ising interfaces to sle curves in multiply connected domains . in that context , a proper choice of the observable @xmath83 ( i.e. , the corresponding double cover @xmath43 ) guarantees its martingale property with respect to the growing interface . to prove that property ,",
    "it is important to relate the values of @xmath83 to the partitions function of the model with relevant boundary conditions . in section [ sec : pfaffian ] , we show how to do it in the most general case , see proposition  [ prop : obsz ] .",
    "the simplest example of an sle process treated in this way ( for which the use of a non - trivial double cover is essential ) is a radial ising interface converging to radial sle@xmath84 .    for simplicity , in the present paper we work on the square grid , but",
    "all our proofs remain valid for the self - dual ising model defined on isoradial graphs ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",

    "we then define the continuous counterparts of the observables and briefly discuss their properties .",
    "section [ sec : proof ] is devoted to the proof of main convergence results for spinor observables : theorem  [ thm : mainconv_int_1 ] ( convergence in the bulk ) and theorem  [ thm : mainconv ] ( convergence on the boundary ) .",
    "we generalize our results to the case of multiple boundary change operators in section  [ sec : pfaffian ] .",
