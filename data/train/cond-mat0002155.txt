    "quantum dots have been in the focus of intensive research already for at least a decade which lead to a countless number of publications ( for a recent book see ref . ) .",
    "although almost all experiments are performed at dot lattices , in the vast majority of theoretical investigations the interaction between dots is neglected .",
    "this is for the following reasons : i ) because the confinement frequency @xmath0 is a parameter , which is mainly extracted from optical properties , it is difficult to tell the influence of dot interaction apart from the intrinsic single dot value .",
    "( possibilities to overcome this problem are discussed in the present work . )",
    "ii ) the theory of raman spectra , which can in principle monitor the dispersion ( wave number dependence ) of excitation energies as a direct consequence of interdot interaction , is not yet advanced enough to extract the dispersion .",
    "iii ) the lattice constant of dot arrays produced with current technologies is so large ( @xmath1 ) that large electron numbers @xmath2 per dot are necessary to obtain a seizable amount of shift . for these n , however , reliable first principle calculations are not possible . with",
    "the advent of self assembled dot arrays the last item might change .",
    "+ the scope of this paper is to investigate conditions , which lead to _ qualitative _ and observable effects of interdot interaction on excitation spectra and the phase transition found in ref .. unlike in ref .",
    ", a magnetic field * b * is explicitly taken into account and a microscopic theory is applied .",
    "our approach is purely microscopic , i.e. we solve the schrdinger equation of a model system _ exactly_. our model comprises the following approximations : i ) the dot confinement is strictly parabolic in radial direction , but with anisotropic confinement frequencies @xmath3 and independent of @xmath2 and * b*. ii ) overlap of wave functions between different dots is neglected ( no hopping ) .",
    "iii ) the coulomb interaction of the electrons in different dots is treated in dipole approximation ( second order in dot diameter over lattice constant ) .",
    "our model is similar to that in ref . , but allows more complicated dots and lattice structures . besides we calculate",
    "also the intra dot excitations ( apart from the collective center of mass excitations ) for @xmath4 explicitly and discuss the instability @xcite in this microscopic model .",
    "our results on the lateral dot dimer are compared with a former paper @xcite , which uses a high magnetic field approach , in sect .",
    "+ the plan of this paper is as follows . for further reference",
    ", we briefly summarize in sect .",
    "i some relevant results for one single dot , or for dot lattices , where the distance between the dots is very large .",
    "this is important , because all exact solutions in the center of mass subsystem are traced back ( by special transformations ) to the solution of this one electron hamiltonian .",
    "this is analogous to ordinary molecular and lattice dynamics .",
    "after this , we consider a dot dimer , which mimics a lattice , where the dots are pairwise close to each other .",
    "this model can give an idea of the effects expected in dot lattices with a basis .",
    "next we consider a rectangular , but primitive lattice in order to obtain the dispersion in the spectra .",
    "finally , the intra - dot excitations of the hamiltonian in the relative coordinates are calculated numerically .",
    "the paper ends with a summary . in the appendix",
    "we give a short and elementary proof for the fact that the generalized kohn theorem holds even for arbitrary arrays of identical non - circular quantum dots with coulomb interaction ( between the dots ) in an homogeneous magnetic field .",

    "because _ in the harmonic model _ both energies depend quadratically on elongation , the dimer _ would _ be ionized , i.e. stripped of the electrons . clearly , in this case we have to go beyond the dipole approximation for the interdot interaction and beyond the harmonic approximation for the confinement potential .    in order to obtain a hand - waving picture of what happens ,",
    "the confinement potential of the system for shear mode oscillations is supplemented by a @xmath128 order term in the following way : @xmath129 $ ] with @xmath130 , and the coulomb interaction in @xmath128 order reads : @xmath131 where @xmath132 as above .",
