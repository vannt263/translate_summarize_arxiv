    "it is a common result of solid state physics that , below its debye temperature , @xmath1 , a solid exhibits a behavior that significantly deviates from the predictions of classical mechanics , because of quantum fluctuations associated to atomic motions : in such conditions , one or several vibration modes of the system do not behave classically , _",
    "i.e. _ the energy quantum @xmath2 separating their eigenstates is significantly higher than the thermal energy @xmath3 . in harmonic , or mildly anharmonic systems ,",
    "quantum effects can be theoretically treated in the framework of the harmonic or quasiharmonic approximation , using the standard quantization of atomic vibrations through the introduction of the normal coordinates , and many solids can be considered as harmonic below a certain temperature .",
    "such harmonic systems usually exhibit weak dependence of their dielectric properties with temperature , and their dielectric permittivity is not sensitive to quantum effects@xcite .    however , the influence of quantum effects is more complex in systems in which the microscopic degrees of freedom move inside a strongly anharmonic energy landscape .",
    "for example , in a number of crystals exhibiting a form of ferroic order related to atomic displacements ( ferroelectric , ferroelastic , antiferrodistortive , ferrotorroidic , etc ) , most of the degrees of freedom typically evolve throughout a multiple - well energy surface .",
    "if the system is considered as classical ( quantum effects neglected ) , there always exists a temperature below which such system exhibits harmonic behavior ( it is finally trapped in one single well of the energy surface ) , but in a quantum system , if the quantum fluctuations on the displacements in the ground state extend beyond the harmonic region associated to each well , the standard treatment of quantum effects by means of the harmonic approximation becomes irrelevant . in such cases , _ where quantum fluctuations of the ground state cause the system to probe the anharmonic part of the potential _",
    ", deviations from the harmonic approximation are expected down to zero  k.    ferroelectric systems are typically characterized by complex multiple - well energy landscapes affecting the polar degrees of freedom , and the interplay between quantum fluctuations and polar modes at low temperature is strongly system - dependent . in the case of a deep multiple - well surface , the effects might be limited to weak quantum delocalization .",
    "but in the case of a shallow multiple - well surface , dramatic consequences can be observed , up to strong tunneling effect that can be able to fight against the order parameter , and even make it disappear .",
    "one of the most spectacular interaction between quantum fluctuations and polar degrees of freedom is indeed the suppression of the ferroelectric polarization due to quantum zero point motions in the so - called `` quantum paraelectric '' materials such as srtio@xmath4@xcite and ktao@xmath4,@xcite two systems in which the existence of an underlying ferroelectric instability ( thus associated to a shallow multiple - well energy surface ) is experimentally infered from the very large and saturated values of the dielectric permittivity just above zero  k , and suggested from density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations in the case of srtio@xmath4@xcite .",
    "similar effects are suggested in another family of compounds , the `` high - temperature '' quantum paraelectrics , such as catio@xmath4@xcite , la@xmath5na@xmath5tio@xmath4@xcite or in a more general way re@xmath5na@xmath5tio@xmath4,@xcite in which re features a rare - earth element .",
    "however , even in `` standard '' ferroelectric crystals such as batio@xmath4 ( bto ) , the quantum effects have been shown by path - integral monte - carlo technique to significantly decrease the phase transition temperatures by @xmath0 30 - 50  k@xcite and to strongly modify the shape of the pressure - temperature phase diagram@xcite up to room temperature .",
    "quantum effects can thus strongly influence the structural and dielectric properties of ferroelectric ( fe ) systems , not only at low temperature but also at room temperature and beyond .",
    "anharmonicities in bto are impacting the physics even at low temperature , as shown by its lowest phase transition ( rhombohedral - orthorhombic  expt : 183  k@xcite , @xmath0 190  k with the hamiltonian used in the present work@xcite ) . in a simple picture ,",
    "each phase transition in bto corresponds , upon heating , to the temperature at which the local modes ( dipoles ) get out of the potential well(s ) in which they were confined , and come to visit new potential energy minima , giving rise to a new value and direction of the macroscopic polarization .",
    "in other words , phase transitions are the points at which anharmonicities in the potential energy surface strongly manifest and impact the physics .",
    "this simple microscopic picture of bto has been theorized more than 40 years ago through the well - known `` eight - site '' order - disorder model of comes _ et al._@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the local dipoles evolve among eight off - center satellite sites located along the @xmath6111@xmath7-type directions . in the paraelectric phase ,",
    "all the sites are visited with equal probability ( resulting in a zero polarization ) , while in the fe phases , only a subset of these sites ( the same at all cells due to strong intersite correlations ) is visited , giving rise to a non - zero polarization .",
    "modern calculations using an effective hamiltonian fitted on first - principles calculations@xcite show that , in the paraelectric phase , the local density of probability is in fact quasi - isotropic ( with slight maxima along the @xmath6111@xmath7 directions ) since the dipoles also spend a significant part of their time between these off - center sites@xcite . at any rate",
    ", this simple model confirms the strongly anharmonic character of this system , at least above its first phase transition and thus , _ the complete impossibility to describe its phase transitions in the harmonic approximation_. let us mention that the signature of anharmonicities is seen also below the first phase transition : in the rhombohedral phase , order - disorder mechanims associated with local reversal of the dipoles have been observed , both experimentally@xcite and by calculations,@xcite suggesting anharmonic behavior also in the ground state phase of bto .",
    "on the other hand , the debye temperature of bto is commonly placed about 150  k above room temperature ( @xmath8 480  k@xcite ) , showing that the dipole dynamics should be impacted by quantum effects up to such high temperature .",
    "therefore , since the structural phase transitions occur well below @xmath1 , subtle interplay between quantum fluctuations and anharmonicities are expected in bto .",
    "let us also mention the fact that the so - called `` temperature rescaling '' method@xcite does not apply to bto since the effective temperature calculated from the phonon density of states obtained at @xmath9  k in the rhombohedral phase is about 250  k , which falls above the two first phase transitions of bto , namely in the tetragonal phase .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the anharmonicities of barium titanate at low temperature ( in its rhombohedral phase ) , that manifest through the quantum fluctuations of its ground state .",
    "we describe the influence of quantum effects on the order parameter , on the dielectric permittivity and on the piezoelectric constants of bto , by using path - integral molecular - dynamics simulations .",
    "the quantum effects related to atomic motions are accounted for by using the path integral ( pi ) formalism . in this formulation of quantum statistical mechanics , the canonical partition function @xmath10 is written as a discretized imaginary time path integral . for a quantum system containing @xmath11 ( discernable ) particles of mass @xmath12",
    ", @xmath10 can be expressed according to :    @xmath13    this integral involves @xmath14 ( trotter number ) replicas of the system labeled by the integer @xmath15 , each replica consisting of a set of @xmath11 positions @xmath16 .",
    "these replicas characterize the discretization of the pi in imaginary time ( imaginary time slices ) .",

    "the discretized expansion of eq .  [ eq0 ] is at the root of a formal analogy@xcite ( `` classical isomorphism''@xcite ) between any quantum system and an equivalent classical system made of @xmath14 images of the initial set of @xmath11 particles , because the multidimensional integral of eq .",
    "[ eq0 ] can be viewed as the canonical partition function of this equivalent classical system .",
    "each quantum particle is associated to a ring polymer of @xmath14 classical particles , these classical particles interacting with each other through the `` true '' physical forces ( divided by @xmath14 ) inside each slice , and through harmonic forces ( acting between each particle of slice @xmath33 and the corresponding particles of slice @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "each set of harmonic interactions is assumed to close onto itself , forming a closed ring ( @xmath36 ) . in the limit where the trotter number @xmath37 , this equivalent classical system has exactly the same partition function as that of the quantum system under study .",
    "the extension to the isothermal - isobaric ensemble ( npt ) is straightforward@xcite .    as a consequence ,",
    "classical simulation techniques such as monte carlo ( mc ) or molecular dynamics ( md ) can be applied to the classical equivalent to estimate numerically the thermodynamic properties of the quantum system .",
    "the corresponding methods are respectively called path - integral monte carlo and path - integral molecular dynamics ( pimd ) .",
    "the estimated properties should be converged with the trotter number , and if this condition is fullfilled , it is possible to compute thermodynamic quantities that exactly include all the quantum _ dispersion _ effects .",
    "however , the path - integral expansion of eq .  [ eq0 ] assumes distinguishible particles .",
    "the physical properties computed by the present pi formalism thus do not include exchange between particles , which are assumed to obey boltzmann statistics@xcite .",
    "practical application of pimd raises technical problems , related to the fact that for high trotter number , the forces acting inside the classical equivalent are mainly harmonic . in such harmonic system , obtaining ergodic trajectories by using the standard algorithms of md such as nos - hoover thermostat is difficult@xcite . in order to recover ergodicity , two different approaches can be employed :    \\(i ) a deterministic approach using efficient schemes based on _ thermostat chains_@xcite ;    \\(ii ) a stochastic approach based on the use of the langevin thermostat@xcite .    in the present case",
    ", we have found very efficient to use the langevin dynamics , which is extremely powerful to produce an ergodic exploration of phase space by introducing at each time step a random force that mimics the `` noise '' observed in the motion of a brownian particle .",
    "we have successfully tested the scheme on simple systems ( 1d and 3d harmonic oscillator , double well potential , quartic potential ) and found an excellent agreement between pimd and the exact result ( obtained by analytic formulae or by a numerical solution of the schrdinger equation ) .",
    "another practical difficulty of pimd is the existence of modes evolving on very different time scales@xcite . to circumvent",
    "this difficulty , a specific coordinate transformation ( `` normal mode '' or `` staging '' ) that diagonalizes the harmonic parts of the pimd forces could be employed",
    ". an appropriate choice of fictitious masses gives the same time scale for the dynamics of each degree of freedom .",
    "instead of using such a coordinate transformation , we performed long enough trajectories ( see sec .",
    "[ md ] ) .",
    "we use the effective hamiltonian of zhong _",
    "et al._@xcite , which is derived from first - principles density - functional calculations and has been shown to provide an excellent description of the thermodynamics of bto , especially its complex sequence of phase transitions : rhombohedral(r ) - orthorhombic(o ) - tetragonal(t ) - cubic(c )  and the ( first ) order of its phase transitions . in particular , although the curie temperature @xmath38 is predicted at @xmath0 300  k , _",
    "i.e. _ about 100 k too low with this hamiltonian , it provides a good value for the r - o phase transition temperature ( @xmath0 190  k without inclusion of quantum effects@xcite , and @xmath0 160  k after inclusion of quantum effects , to be compared with the experimental value of 183  k@xcite ) .",
    "the degrees of freedom of this hamiltonian are the local modes @xmath39 , the mechanical displacement modes @xmath40 and the ( homogeneous ) strain tensor @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is , roughly speaking , the local polar displacement inside cell @xmath43 , related to the local dipolar moment @xmath44 through an effective charge @xmath45 : @xmath46 .",
    "for simplicity , the mechanical displacement modes  that allow appearance of an inhomogeneous component of the total strain and have been shown to be of very weak influence in this material@xcite  are not accounted for in the present study .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath47 is thus a function of the local modes @xmath48 , and of the ( homogeneous ) strain tensor components @xmath41 .",
    "it consists of a ( local ) `` onsite '' part , a long - range dipole - dipole interaction term , a term describing short - range interactions between neighboring local modes ( up to 3@xmath49 neighbor ) , a ( local ) term that couples the local mode to the strain and an elastic energy@xcite . in the presence of an external electric field",
    "@xmath50 , a term @xmath51 is added .    in this work ,",
    "we use in the discussion the mean local mode @xmath6@xmath52@xmath7 as order parameter ( this is a displacement ) . an unambiguous relationship with the spontaneous polarization @xmath53",

    "for each temperature , the macroscopic order parameter @xmath6@xmath52@xmath7 and the homogeneous strain are obtained by averaging over unit cells , ( real ) time steps , and imaginary time slices , allowing to determine the symmetry of the phase ( r , o , t or c ) .",
    "bto is simulated under fixed ( hydrostatic ) pressure and fixed temperature conditions . since",
    "langevin dynamics is very efficient to recover ergodicity within the pi formalism in the canonical ensemble , we wish to use this method , not only under fixed temperature but also under fixed pressure .",
    "the extension of the langevin method to the isothermal - isobaric ensemble has precisely been achieved by quigley and probert@xcite , giving rise to an algorithm in which random and friction forces are applied , not only on the atomic coordinates , but also on the supercell vectors .",

    "this random force on the barostat is symmetrized at each time step to avoid global rotation of the supercell during the simulation .",

    "let us denote by @xmath101 the zero - point energy associated to atomic motions , and by @xmath102 the typical ( free ) energy barrier to overcome to reverse the polarization ( as would be given for instance by a phenomenological treatment within landau theory ) .",
    "different prototypical cases can be described .",
    "\\(i ) fe crystals with very deep double - well free energy landscape exhibit large barrier height ( @xmath102 ) compared to @xmath101 and thus a curie temperature @xmath38 relatively high .",

    "this is typically the case of the quantum paraelectric crystals , such as ktao@xmath4.@xcite in such systems , the dielectric permittivity increases upon cooling but , since the phase transition does not take place , it eventually saturates to a large value down to zero  k.    \\(iii ) an intermediate situation corresponds to a zero - point energy @xmath105 , but large enough anyway so that the ground state extends up to the anharmonic region of the potential ( while staying confined in a single energy minimum ) . in such a case , all the physical quantities exhibit therefore anharmonic behavior down to @xmath9  k. the dielectric permittivity , in particular , saturates at low temperature , as a property of the ground state . in the present work we have demonstrated that bto belongs to this last case , _ and",
    "is thus an anharmonic system down to zero kelvin_. it is important to point out that in the case of the classical treatment , harmonic behavior is observed at sufficiently low @xmath30 , leading here again to a plateau in the low - temperature evolution of the dielectric permittivity .",
    "however , the difference of origin between the quantum and classical plateaus is reflected by their different values ( the quantum plateau is higher than the classical one ) .",
    "in this work , the pimd simulations have been performed to study low - temperature ( r phase ) dielectric and piezoelectric properties of bto : spontaneous polarization , dielectric susceptibility and piezoelectric constants .",
    "we have shown that these three properties are different whether they are treated classically or quantum - mechanically .",
    "more precisely , significant enhancement of the dielectric tensor components and of the piezoelectric constants are observed as a consequence of the inclusion of quantum fluctuations .",
    "such enhancement is attributed to the anharmonic contributions to the ground state , in which the system saturates at low temperature .    by contrast , without including the quantum effects , the system eventually becomes harmonic at low temperature . in bto ,",

    "this is corroborated by the significant difference between the low - temperature spontaneous polarizations computed classically and quantum - mechanically .",
    "bto is a strongly anharmonic system down to zero kelvin , the anharmonicity being retained at low temperature by the quantum zero - point effects .",

    "<S> we investigate the influence of quantum effects on the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of barium titanate in its ( low - temperature ) rhombohedral phase , and show the strongly anharmonic character of this system even at low temperature . for this purpose , we perform path - integral molecular - dynamics simulations under fixed pressure and fixed temperature , using an efficient langevin thermostat - barostat , and an effective hamiltonian derived from first - principles calculations . the quantum fluctuations are shown to significantly enhance the static dielectric susceptibility ( @xmath0 by a factor 2 ) and the piezoelectric constants , reflecting the strong anharmonicity of this ferroelectric system even at very low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the slow temperature - evolution of the dielectric properties observed below @xmath0 100  k is attributed ( i ) to zero - point energy contributions and ( ii ) to harmonic behavior if quantum effects are turned off . </S>"
