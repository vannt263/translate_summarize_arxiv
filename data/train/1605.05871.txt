    "it can change due to the magnetostriction , modulation of the magnetic exchange by lattice vibrations ( spin - phonon coupling ) , and due to the changes in the electron - phonon interaction due to spin polarization and changes in the electronic spectrum .",

    ".    the dft calculations can give us some guidance for understanding of the changes of the phonon frequencies and linewidths , but one has to be aware of its limitations .",
    "the dft calculations ( see table ii ) give a rather large magnetostriction , i.e.  rather large change in the size of the unit cell between the fm and pm phases ( @xmath46 changes by 3.2% and @xmath26 by 4.3% ) .",
    "this leads to very large changes in the phonon frequencies , see table iii .",

    "this already points to the limitations of the dft calculations , which is expected near the phase transition .",
    "similar conclusion is also present in ref .",
    "the dft ignores spin fluctuations which often leads to quantitative discrepancy in various physical quantities @xcite and , in some cases , even predicts wrong phases . in the case of k@xmath0co@xmath1se@xmath2",
    ", the dft calculations correctly predict the fm ground state , but the calculated magnetic moment @xmath93 is much larger than the experimental value @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "this already shows the importance of correlations and quantum fluctuations which are neglected within the dft .",
    "strong correlation effects can be captured using screened hybrid functional @xcite or within the dynamical mean field theory combined with dft ( lda+dmft ) @xcite , which is beyond our present work .",
    "since the magnetostriction effects are overestimated in the dft calculations with relaxed unit cell size , we repeated the dft ( dfpt ) calculations keeping the experimental value for the unit cell size and relaxing only the fractional coordinate ( positions of the se atoms ) .",
    "this is often done in the literature on iron based superconductors and related compounds @xcite .",
    "our calculated frequencies are given in the parenthesis in table iii .",
    "we see that the frequency changes between the two phases are small , in better agreement with the experiment .",
    "the phonon linewidths of the a@xmath3 and b@xmath3 modes are very large , @xmath95 @xmath53 and @xmath96 @xmath53 , which implies the importance of disorder ( impurities , nonstoichiometry , lattice imperfections ) in measured samples .",
    "in general , the broadening of the phonon lines can be a consequence of the electron - phonon interaction , disorder , spin fluctuations and anharmonicity effects .",
    "the temperature dependence of the linewidth in the pm phase is , however , very weak , which indicates that the anharmonicity effects are small .",
    "the dft calculation of the linewidth is usually based on the allen s formula , @xcite @xmath97 .",
    "here , @xmath98 is the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level , @xmath99 is the electron - phonon coupling constant , and @xmath100 is the phonon frequency of the mode @xmath59 and wavevector @xmath101 . a straightforward implementation of allen s formula in the @xmath102 limit corresponding to the @xmath13 point is , however , unjustified , as explained for example in refs .",
    "in addition , structural disorder and impurities break the conservation of the momentum , which means that phonons with finite wave vectors also contribute to the raman scattering spectra .",
    "the standard dft calculation for the brillouin zone averaged electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath103 gives too small value to explain the large width of the raman lines in pnictides and chalcogenides,@xcite and several other metallic systems like mgb@xmath2 @xcite and fullerides @xcite .",
    "a correct estimate of the phonon linewidth can be obtained only by explicitly taking into account the disorder and electron scattering which enhances the electron - phonon interaction,@xcite which is beyond the standard dft approach and scope of the present work .",
    "the raman mode linewidth is not directly affected by the lattice thermal expansion .",
    "assuming that the three - phonon processes represent leading temperature dependent term in the paramagnetic phase , full width at half - maximum , @xmath65 , is given by @xmath104 the first term represents the anharmonicity induced effects , where @xmath105 is the anharmonic constant .",
    "the second term @xmath106 includes the contributions from other scattering channels , i.e. structural disorder and/or coupling of phonons with other elementary excitations , like particle - hole and spin excitations .",

    "small and sometimes irregular changes in @xmath65 are also observed in other materials whose raman spectra are considered to be dominated by spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "therefore , we believe that a simple separation of @xmath65 to the anharmonic and temperature independent term , which works well in many systems , is not appropriate for itinerant magnetic systems like k@xmath0co@xmath1se@xmath2 . we conclude that the spin fluctuations and electron - phonon coupling are likely to affect the linewidth even above @xmath6 .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction strength is proportional to the density of states at the fermi level @xmath98 .",
    "our dft calculations for the dos agree with those in ref .",
    "the calculated dos in the fm phase , @xmath111/ev , is smaller than , @xmath112/ev , in the pm phase .",
    "( though , in reality , it is possible that the dos significantly differs from the one given by the dft calculations due to the spin fluctuations and disorder effects . ) therefore , one expects that the phonon line is narrower in the fm phase than in the pm phase .",
    "this is indeed the case for the a@xmath3 mode , but the opposite is observed for the b@xmath3 mode .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the b@xmath3 mode is much more asymmetric than the a@xmath3 mode and almost twice broader .",

    "the vibrational mode that modulates the distance between the magnetic cr atoms also features large asymmetry and linewidth . in our case , the distances between the magnetic co ions are modulated by the vibrations of the b@xmath3 mode , see fig .  1 .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that the anomalous features of the b@xmath3 mode are the consequence of spin fluctuations coupled to the electronic structure via lattice vibrations ( in addition to the magnetostriction and spin polarization , which change the electronic spectrum near the fermi level and , therefore , affect the electron - phonon interaction for both modes ) .",
    "it should be noted that similar anomalous properties of b@xmath3 phonon were experimentally observed in cuprate high - temperature superconductor yba@xmath2cu@xmath113o@xmath114 @xcite , and explained as a consequence of the out - of - phase nature of this mode which couples to oxygen - oxygen in - plane charge fluctuations @xcite in the case of iron - based superconductors and related compounds , the chalcogen atoms and fe ( or co ) are not in the same plane and phonons of a@xmath3 symmetry can also directly couple with the electrons . a satisfactory agreement of theory and raman experiments remains to be established @xcite .",

    "spin fluctuations increase the electron - phonon scattering , similar as does the disorder .",
    "technically , the electronic green function acquires an imaginary component of the self energy due to the spin fluctuations , and this implies the increase in the damping term in the phonon self - energy , as explained in , e.g. ref .",

    "<S> polarized raman scattering spectra of the k@xmath0co@xmath1se@xmath2 single crystals reveal the presence of two phonon modes , assigned as of the a@xmath3 and b@xmath3 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> absence of additional modes excludes the possibility of vacancy ordering , unlike in k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase transition at @xmath4 k leaves a clear fingerprint on the temperature dependence of the raman mode energy and linewidth . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath5 the temperature dependence looks conventional , driven by the thermal expansion and anharmonicity . </S>",
    "<S> the raman modes are rather broad due to the electron - phonon coupling increased by the disorder and spin fluctuation effects . in the fm phase the phonon frequency of both modes increases , while an opposite trend is seen in their linewidth : the a@xmath3 mode narrows in the fm phase , whereas the b@xmath3 mode broadens . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the large asymmetry and anomalous frequency shift of the b@xmath3 mode is due to the coupling of spin fluctuations and vibration . </S>",
    "<S> our density functional theory ( dft ) calculations for the phonon frequencies agree rather well with the raman measurements , with some discrepancy being expected since the dft calculations neglect the spin fluctuations . </S>"
