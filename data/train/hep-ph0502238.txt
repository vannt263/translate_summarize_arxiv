    "recent experimental data from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) further emphasize the important role of jet physics in extracting information from relativistic proton - proton ( @xmath0 ) and nuclear collisions about the strong interaction in the hard sector  @xcite .",
    "in particular , hadron - hadron correlations have been used to learn about the transverse momentum distribution of partons in the proton  @xcite .",
    "some of these measurements report a trigger dependent width for the intrinsic transverse momentum distribution of partons in the proton .",
    "we aim to understand the origin of any such dependence , which appears surprising at first sight .",
    "the procedure to extract the transverse momentum width of partons in the proton is complicated experimentally because partonic properties need to be inferred from final - state hadrons .",
    "on the theory side , perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) studies have been carried out recently , primarily with the goal of addressing asymmetries in polarized proton - proton scattering  @xcite . here",
    "we restrict our attention to unpolarized scattering and focus on the information that can be obtained from measured quantities .    in the framework of perturbative qcd , the starting point for the description of high transverse - momentum particle production in a @xmath0 collision",
    "is provided by the secondary partons produced in elementary parton - parton collisions .",
    "gluon radiation affects all partons , and the secondary partons may go through rescattering and multi - parton interaction even in a @xmath0 collision .",
    "furthermore , the partons must finally hadronize , fragmenting into observable high - energy final - state hadrons .",
    "we address whether the width of the initial transverse momentum distribution of the partons in the proton can be extracted in this environment .",
    "another goal is to prepare the way for the study of hadron - hadron correlations in nuclear collisions ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) . especially in matter , while leading - order ( lo ) calculations have a clear physical interpretation , there are many sources of complication in higher orders . in this paper",
    "we first consider @xmath5 processes ( lo ) with an `` intrinsic '' transverse momentum .",
    "the average `` intrinsic '' @xmath1 effectively contains the contribution of perturbative soft gluon radiation , clouding the separation of perturbative orders  @xcite .",
    "further higher - order corrections include various random initial and final - state processes ( elastic and inelastic scattering on colored scattering centers and hard radiation ) . mirroring the experimental situation , we focus on the transverse momentum components , and find it economical for this purpose to represent these corrections by a randomization prescription . this way we maintain a simple interpretation of di - hadron correlations .",
    "we show that the degree of randomization determines whether the transverse - momentum width of the parton distribution in the proton can be extracted from data .",
    "a naive procedure to accomplish this in the case of partial correlation is outlined .    in the second part of the paper",
    "the complications from parton fragmentation are introduced .",
    "we derive a practical formula to extract the intrinsic transverse momentum width from the measured widths of the near - side and away - side peaks of the hadron - hadron correlation function .",
    "the necessary approximations are discussed and the relation to commonly - used formulae is noted .",

    "the initial partons have transverse momentum components @xmath6 and @xmath7 , while the secondary partons are characterized by transverse momenta @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",

    "2.3 we introduce a model for the partially correlated case , where the loss of correlations can be a result of any number of further interactions .",
