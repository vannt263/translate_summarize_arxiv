    "in recent years , there has been a rapidly increasing interest in two - neutron decays of unbound nuclei beyond the neutron drip line @xcite .",
    "these are similar phenomena to the two - proton radioactivities in unbound nuclei beyond the proton - drip line @xcite , but with neutrons .",
    "while the resonance in proton radioactivity is mainly due to the coulomb barrier , the resonant two - neutron emission arises from penetration of a centrifugal barrier .",
    "since the long range coulomb interaction is absent in the two - neutron decays , it has in general been expected that nucleon correlations , such as the dineutron correlations @xcite , are easier to be probed in the two - neutron decays as compared to the two - proton decays .    among the two - neutron emitters",
    "studied so far , the @xmath0o nucleus has attracted a particular attention @xcite , owing partly to the problem of abrupt termination of neutron - drip line for the oxygen isotopes at the neutron number @xmath6=16 @xcite .",
    "the ground state decay of this nucleus was first observed by lunderberg _",
    "_ at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory ( nscl ) at michigan state university ( msu ) @xcite",
    ". a clear resonance peak was observed in the decay energy spectrum at @xmath7 kev @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed by the gsi - land group , who reported the upper limit of the decay energy to be 40 and 120 kev with the confident level of 68% and 95% , respectively @xcite .",
    "these experimental data on the ground state decay of @xmath0o have been theoretically analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "very recently , new experimental data on the decay of the @xmath8o nuclei came out from the radioactive ion beam factory ( ribf ) at riken , which have revised the previous data with much higher statistics @xcite .",

    "@xcite has also reported a clear second peak at 1.28 @xmath10 mev @xcite , which is likely due to the excited 2@xmath3 state .",
    "the data for the @xmath2o have also been revised in this experiment .",
    "while the previous measurements reported the @xmath11 resonance state at 770@xmath12 kev with the width of 172@xmath13 kev @xcite , and at 725@xmath14 kev with the width of 20@xmath15 kev @xcite , the new measurement has shown the @xmath11 resonance state at 749 ( 10 ) kev with the width of 88 ( 6 ) kev @xcite .    in this paper",

    "we also discuss the structure of excited @xmath17 and @xmath18 resonance states , which were not presented in our previous publications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the resonance structure of the @xmath2o nucleus .",
    "we use the new experimental data for this nucleus to determine the @xmath16-@xmath1o potential and obtain the resonance states of @xmath2o .",
    "we also discuss how the green s function can be used to estimate the width of the resonance states . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the decay energy spectrum for the @xmath17 configuration of the @xmath0o nucleus .",

    "iv , we discuss the first 2@xmath3 state , and make a comparison with other theoretical calculations . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss the angular correlation of the emitted two neutrons and show that the back - to - back emission is enhanced due to the dineutron correlation .",

    "an important input for the three - body calculation is the potential between a neutron and the core nucleus . in order to calibrate it",
    ", we first discuss the properties of the two - body subsystem of @xmath0o , that is , the @xmath2o nucleus , using the neutron + @xmath1o model .    assuming that @xmath1o is inert in the ground state , we consider the following single - particle hamiltonian for the relative motion between a neutron and the core nucleus : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the reduced mass , @xmath21 and @xmath22 being the nucleon mass and the mass number of the core nucleus , respectively .",

    "the resultant value is @xmath31 = 45.605 mev @xmath33 , which is slightly smaller than the value employed in ref .",
    "this potential yields the resonance width of 87.2 kev , which agrees well with the experimental value , 86 ( 6 ) kev @xcite .",
    "in addition to the @xmath11 resonance , we also find a broad @xmath34 and a relatively narrow @xmath35 resonances with this potential .",
    "for the @xmath34 resonance , the resonance energy and the width are @xmath36 = 0.577 mev and @xmath37 = 1.63 mev , respectively , while they are @xmath36 = 2.44 mev and @xmath37 = 0.21 mev for the @xmath35 resonance .",
    "notice that , due to the lower centrifugal barrier , the @xmath34 resonance appears at a lower energy with a larger width compared to the @xmath11 and @xmath35 resonances .",

    "the angular distribution is symmetric with respect to @xmath55 ( see the dotted line ) . on the other hand ,",
    "in the presence of the interaction between the valence neutrons , the angular distribution becomes highly asymmetric , with an enhancement of the back - to - back emission @xcite , as is shown by the solid line .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the dineutron correlation in the momentum space shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : density2-p ] .    as we have already discussed in sec .",

    "one can now see the enhancement of the back - to - back emission , due to the interference between the @xmath39=0 and @xmath39=1 components , reflecting the dineutron correlation .",
    "moreover , one can also see that the angular distribution is almost exhausted only by the @xmath39=0 and @xmath39=1 components .",
    "one can view this as follows .",
    "that is , the original @xmath57 component in the reference wave function , @xmath58 , is scattered by the neutron - neutron interaction to the @xmath59 and @xmath60 configurations during the penetration of the centrifugal barrier , and are then observed as emitted neutrons from @xmath0o @xcite . the operator @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ amplitude2 ] ) has a responsibility for this multiple scattering process during the penetration .",
    "the mixing between the @xmath59 and @xmath60 configurations is such that the back - to - back emission is enhanced being consistent with the dineutron correlation . in principle , the two neutrons may be scattered to high partial waves , but these are suppressed due to high centrifugal barriers .",

    "@xcite , the degree of asymmetry is smaller in the present calculation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] .",
    "this is due to the smaller ground state energy , that is , we employ the ground state energy of 18 kev while ref .",
    "@xcite considered the energy of 140 kev . since the energy is smaller , the @xmath62 wave contribution is smaller in the present calculation .",
    "this leads to a smaller admixture between the @xmath56-wave and the @xmath62-wave components , and thus the smaller asymmetry in the angular distribution . in order to see this , fig .",
    "[ fig : angular2 ] shows the dependence of the angular distribution on the ground state energy . for this purpose",

    ", one can see that the asymmetry indeed becomes larger as the ground state energy increases .",
    "if the ground state energy further increases , the @xmath63-wave starts contributing , and the forward angle components grow up , even though the back - to - back emission is still enhanced due to the dineutron correlation .",
