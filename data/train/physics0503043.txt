    "due to the fundamental importance of the waves and instabilities in plasma and hydrodynamics investigations , computational researchers have devoted great efforts in developing appropriate tools .",
    "one of the main challenges after developing numerically stable algorithms in fluid models has been generation of the waves in the linear , nonlinear as well as unstable modes ; i.e. waves which preserve analytic dispersion relations@xcite . furthermore extending the case of hydrodynamics to that of mhd and or plasma physics one deals with waves with considerably more complicated propagation characteristics than the hydrodynamics cases treated by those authors ; i.e. dispersion , polarization , oblique propagations , etc .",
    "the main problems in generating a wave spectrum from small amplitude disturbances in fluid equations are : ( 1 ) the highly nonlinear nature of those equations ; ( 2 ) the lack of an initial thermal velocity distribution .",
    "the first problem could cause any small amplitude configuration space disturbance to grow to very large amplitudes in relatively short times and result in wave breaking and non - propagation .",
    "also when there does exist a thermal distribution , there are always a distribution of thermalized particles in phase with most waves ; they can therefore excite the allowed modes to at least half their thermal level .",
    "therefore in a case without thermal equilibrium , a disturbance of arbitrary wavelength can not strictly speaking apportion its energy to other allowed modes .",
    "for example in purely electrostatic cases , we know from equilibrium statistical mechanics that when there exist a thermal distribution each mode @xmath0 can acquire an energy @xcite : @xmath1 to investigate mhd wave spectra therefore magnetohydrodynamic particle codes have served as powerful tools@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . for other plasma waves",
    "pic @xcite and @xcite or hybrid codes @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have served as the main wave investigation tools ; i.e. , basically codes which start from thermal equilibrium . in these codes",
    "the random particle distribution acts like a disturbance in velocity space and configuration space remains unaltered at the beginning of each simulation .",
    "in our case we initiate each simulation by a perturbation in configuration space . despite the initial shape of the perturbation , we observe other allowed modes to develop similar to pic simulations .",
    "we believe that the mesh discretization and the finite differencing contribute in the following ways : ( i ) round of errors alter the initial perturbation shape and can drive other wavelength ; ( ii ) as the nonlinear effects grow amplitudes and shorten wavelengths to the numerical dissipation and dispersion scale lengths , these effects can act to dampen and initiate the propagation of the different modes and prevent indefinite nonlinear growth .",
    "these effects can therefore explain the observed wave spectra .",
    "with this then we can use fluid instead of pic codes as a convenient alternative to investigate many waves .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section ii the model is treated analytically ; in section iii the numerical scheme ( algorithm , stability and conservation laws ) are presented ; in section iv the various tests of the model are presented ( test of the dispersion relation , two stream instability , screening effect and nonlinear harmonic generation ) . at the end a brief summary and conclusion with future direction",
    "are presented .",
    "we focus on the investigation of the high frequency ( hf ) longitudinal waves ; i. e. a frequency domain where ions can be safely assumed to form an immobile background ( @xmath2 represents their uniform density ) .",
    "the appropriate equations are then poisson s and the electron fluid equations : @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the self - consistent electric potential , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the electron density , velocity , pressure and rest mass respectively . without any loss of generality this problem is treated in one dimension .",
    "these basic equations are supplemented by an  equation of state  according to the particular thermodynamic properties of the fluid of interest . here ,",
    "isothermal equation of state is used : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the electron temperature and is assumed to be constant and boltzmann s constant , @xmath13 , is assumed to be unity .",
    "the minimum requirement of any computational model lies in its ability to preserve conservation laws ; for that fluid equations are cast in flux conservative form . equation ( [ 2 ] ) in conservative form upon using eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) in eq . ( [ 2 ] ) becomes : @xmath14 note that the logarithmic term is caused by the electron pressure .",
    "therefore the three equations that form the basis of our model are : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 we will next derive a dispersion relation for wave propagation using eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) , and ( [ 8 ] ) . to do this ,",
    "linearizing eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) , and ( [ 8 ] ) about a spatially uniform equilibrium ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , we obtain the following set : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 assuming simple plane wave solutions , eqs .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) , and ( [ 11 ] ) reduce to the following set of equations : @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 eqs .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) , and ( [ 14 ] ) yield nontrivial solution if the following is obeyed : @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the electron plasma frequency and the thermal velocity , respectively",
    ".    studies of langmuir waves ( hf electron waves ) are of particular importance . aside from the applications to real experimental situations which will become evident in the application section ,",
    "they serve as excellent probes for testing the validity of the fluid code that we have developed .",
    "our model is simply an intuitive construct based on well - known fluid dynamics and poisson s equations , geared toward plasma physics applications , where many different wave phenomena in dispersive media are of interest .",
    "its physical  conceptual basis  can be regarded as a model that treats non - stationary electron wave motion for hf domain where @xmath29 in linear and nonlinear regions . besides",
    ", it can predict electron wave spectrum more accurately than  particle in cell simulation  as here we expect less numerical noise .      in these calculations we use the following normalizations : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the electron debye length .",
    "using these definitions , eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 3 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) , and ( [ 15 ] ) can now be rewritten as follows : @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 it is already mentioned , logarithmic term in eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) is caused by the electron pressure .. thus the code has the flexibility of being easily converted to the case when electron pressure is negligible .",
    "next we shall describe the numerical scheme .",
    "the steps of the scheme are summarized in table i. a lax - wendroff method is used to push @xmath7 and @xmath8 , while a poisson solver at the end of each step updates the electric potential .    the grid spacing and time step are denoted by @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "the fluid velocity and density are known at integer time step @xmath38 . to complete the initial conditions ,",
    "@xmath6 is computed at the same time step ( @xmath38 ) by the help of a poisson solver that is based on tridiagonal matrix method .",
    "then @xmath7 and @xmath8 are pushed from @xmath38 to @xmath39 as the auxiliary step of the lax - wendroff scheme using eqs .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) ( please refer to item 3 of the table i ) .",
    "then again @xmath6 is computed in the auxiliary step ( @xmath39 ) using the value of @xmath7 in the mentioned step .",
    "having known @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath6 at the time step @xmath39 , we push @xmath7 and @xmath8 all the way to time step @xmath40 as the main step of the lax - wendroff scheme in eqs .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) ( items 5 and 6 in table i ) .",
    "the electric potential @xmath6 is then computed at the time step @xmath40 using @xmath41 .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]     the reason for these choices is that the first perturbation maintain harmonics with wave numbers very close to @xmath42 while the latter two maintain harmonics more uniformly distributed in the @xmath13 space .",
    "the most important reason for such choices was to determine the impact of the initial perturbations on the final wave spectra ; strictly speaking the latter two are expected to give rise to more uniform spectra .",
    "the initial velocity profiles corresponding to these three profiles are drawn in figs .",
    "1(a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "these velocity profiles indicate broader and more uniform distribution of bulk flow velocities in the latter two ; i.e. the volume of phase space available to wave propagations are considerably larger .",
    "= 9truecm    given these two facts though , the plots of the power spectra , t ) , next for each @xmath43 temporal fft is performed on e(@xmath43,t ) ] of the modes versus @xmath44 ( their frequency ) indicate very close agreement in all the cases ; i.e. regardless of the initially excited modes and phase velocities , most the allowed @xmath13-space tends to get excited .",
    "this supports our earlier claim that the discretization procedure and the numerical dispersion and dissipation have in effect broadened and stabilized the initial spectrum .",
    "finally the plots of the dispersion relation for a system size of 1024@xmath45 with @xmath46 are shown in fig 2 and 3 .",
    "the close agreement between the analytic theory ( solid lines ) and the model ( circles ) for wave numbers @xmath13 as large as 6 indicate resolution of the modes with wave lengths of the order of grid spacing with negligible numerical dispersion .",
    "comparison of these with the corresponding pic simulations for a system 256@xmath45 length ( fig .",
    "4 ) clearly indicate resolution of much shorter wavelengths here and considerably less numerical dispersion . this is understandable since in the pic models",
    "the finite particle size effects introduce additional numerical dispersion which cause smaller allowed @xmath13 s .",
    "= 9truecm    = 6truecm    = 6truecm    one last remark about the cases corresponding to figs .",
    "2 and 3 is that the latter involves the case in which the bulk plasma had an initial flow velocity .",
    "3 not only shows that the doppler shifted waves also obey their respected dispersion relation , it also shows how any `` resulting '' plasma flow could impact those waves . that is if any nonzero average flow should arise from the initial perturbations ( i.e. if the scheme does not preserve momentum conservation ) the dispersion relation would be impacted as in fig .",
    "3 . a glance at fig . 2",
    "though points that there could not have been any doppler shift and therefore no net plasma flow must have resulted from the initial perturbations .",
    "calculations also showed that @xmath47 initially remained so to round off errors throughout the simulation .",
    "so these plots also probe the momentum to be conserved in the model .      in the next example",
    "a wave is launched from the boundary and its behavior is followed . theoretically , recall that in an unmagnetized plasma and in the linear regime the plasma shields any incoming ac density perturbation whose frequency is less than plasma frequency ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this effect is shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) and fig .",
    "6 . in this example",
    "the frequency of the applied density perturbation is half of the plasma frequency .",
    "the wave is launched at @xmath49 .",
    "the amplitude of the density perturbation has the following range : nonlinear ( 0.2,1.8 ) fig .",
    "5(a ) and linear ( 0.99,1.01 ) fig .",
    "the penetration depth is from @xmath50 in the linear and @xmath51 in the nonlinear case .",
    "furthermore as fig .",
    "6(a ) indicates , upon penetration , after one wave period following the first crest ( @xmath52 ) , the second crest steepens with its wavelength decreasing to grid cell scale . in the linear regime",
    "though [ fig .",
    "6(b ) ] no steepening can be seen .",
    "= 10truecm    in the other case , with the same initial condition ( respect to linear case ) , we launched a wave whose frequency was larger than the plasma frequency ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "this time the density perturbation propagated into the plasma with its wavelength and amplitude unchanged as it penetrated the plasma .",
    "its behavior also conformed with the analytic dispersion relation .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "= 12truecm    = 12truecm      as a more severe test of the code , we treated the two stream instability .",
    "although the instability arises under a wide range of beam conditions , we shall consider only the simple case of two countrastreaming uniform beams of electrons with the same number density @xmath54 .",
    "the first beam travels in the x direction with drift velocity @xmath55 and the second beam in the opposite direction with same drift velocity , i.e. the countrastreaming beams have the same speed .",
    "the dispersion relation is as follows : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the same plasma frequency for both beams .",
    "one can then obtain the following expression for @xmath58 : @xmath59 this relationship between @xmath58 and @xmath60 is shown graphically in fig .",
    "it is clear that , there exists a critical wave number @xmath61 which separates the stable and unstable modes .",
    "in fact , for @xmath62 two values of @xmath44 are complex , one of which represents a growing wave ; i.e. an instability .",
    "moreover , there exists a wave number @xmath63 that corresponds to the most unstable mode .",
    "= 6truecm    these effects are examined by the fluid code . in this case",
    "the code was generalized to a two countrastreaming fluid model .",
    "as the two countrastreaming beams emerging from the opposite ends meet half way into the simulation box , a growing wavelike disturbance develops . figs . 9 and 10",
    "show the evolution of this disturbance for the cases with and without the pressure terms respectively . in both cases",
    "the disturbance grows locally while in the latter it also begins to propagate in both directions ; i.e. a result of the dispersion due to the pressure term .",
    "= 10truecm    = 12truecm    furthermore , the instability of each mode was investigated using the mode energy discussed in the previous section : i.e. @xmath64 the time derivative of this function with respect to @xmath13 is shown in fig .",
    "as expected , there exists a critical wave number bellow which unstable modes can grow .",
    "furthermore we observed the the most unstable mode corresponding to @xmath65 as the maximum in the fig .",
    "also the dynamic evolution of the beam - beam interaction was observed as a movie and both the disturbance growth and upstream propagations ( when pressure term was included ) were observed .",
    "the result of this paper demonstrates that fluid model can be used to investigate any waves predicted by their basic set of equation .",
    "this can include waves of kinetic nature with and without dispersion with resolution far greater than the corresponding pic codes .",
    "it was demonstrated that appropriate initial perturbations coupled with difference algorithms of sufficient but not excessive numerical dispersion and dissipation can give rise to wave spectra spanning all the allowed k - space .",
