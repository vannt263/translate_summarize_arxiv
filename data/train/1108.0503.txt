    "in other words , although a full set of quantum numbers do not exist for labeling such states , there are reasons to believe that a sufficient number of approximate quantum numbers do exist to understand , and hence assign , the eigenstates . since the approximate quantum numbers arise out of the local dynamics due to specific resonances , relevant at the energies of interest , the assignment is inherently dynamical in nature . in a nutshell ,",

    "a rather extensive study@xcite of nearly @xmath29 zeroth - order bright (  feature \" ) states by chowdary and gruebele concluded that about one in thousand feature states are localized even at the highest energy - not enough to invalidate statistical theories but certainly indicating that even near the dissociation limit sccl@xmath0 is not just a bag - of - atoms .    the above observations hint at the existence of different classes of eigenstates in a specific energy range .",

    "state space plots and the participation ratio data do establish the first state of the sequence to be closer to being a @xmath5-resonant state .",

    "a remarkable aspect that emerges from this and other previous studies is worth noting - the expectation values shown , for example , in fig .",
    "[ fullplot ] are quantum objects .",
    "nevertheless , the observed patterns and sequences in the expectation values have a one - to - one correspondence with the semiclassical angle space densities of the eigenstates .",
    "thus , this establishes the close classical - quantum correspondence that exists for spectroscopic hamiltonians . at the same time , the observation that state space based measures of localization or delocalization of the eigenstates are insufficient to identify the sequences suggests that phase space is the ideal setting where the true nature of the eigenstates are revealed - a conclusion that fortifies decades of earlier work@xcite on systems with smaller degrees of freedom .",
    "the semiclassical action - angle representation is not all that abstract afterall !",
    "it is heartening to see that the simple level - velocity approach is capable of identifying the eigenstate sequences .",
    "the present work agrees , to a large extent , with the previous analysis@xcite and classification of the eigenstates .",
    "in particular , the eigenstate classes predicted in the earlier studies do persist in this study which uses a more accurate hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , the different classes of eigenstates and predictions of their influence on the ivr dynamics of certain zeroth - order bright states are expected to be robust even upon inclusion of other weak higher order resonances .",
    "the approach adopted in this work is easily generalized to systems with any number of degrees of freedom with several anharmonic resonances .",
    "the recently proposed method@xcite of lifting the eigenstates onto the arnold web _ i.e. , _ the network of nonlinear resonances can lead to further detailed insights into the anatomy of certain mixed states ( cf .",

    "[ psgoodsemi ] presents another crucial question .",
    "are there experimental signatures of the eigenstate sequences ? clearly , a state localized in the semiclassical angle space representation need not be localized in the state space representation . however , since the quantum expectation values do pick out the sequences correctly , it is of some interest to see if there are any spectral signatures of such different classes of eigenstate sequences . alternatively , fig .",
    "[ n4bifurplot ] suggests that new modes , like the counter - rotator and local bending modes in acetylene , might appear in sccl@xmath0 due to the various bifurcations in the underlying classical phase space .",
    "again , there must be spectral fingerprints of such new modes .",
    "more work in this direction needs to be done .",
