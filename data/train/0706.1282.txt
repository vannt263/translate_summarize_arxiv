    "the charge exchange reaction is well known as an effective tool to excite the isobaric analog of the target ground state .",
    "such an isobaric analog state ( ias ) has essentially the same structure as the ground state of the target except for the replacement of a neutron by a proton and , hence , differs in energy approximately by the coulomb energy of the added proton . in the isospin representation ,",
    "the two states are just two members of the isospin multiplet which differ only in the orientation of the isospin @xmath6 .",
    "the similarity of the initial and final states of the reaction makes this reaction very much like an elastic scattering in which the isospin of the incident proton is  flipped \" .",
    "indeed , the isospin dependent part of the optical potential ( op ) was used by satchler _",
    ". _ @xcite some 40 years ago as the charge exchange form factor in their study of the reaction within the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) .",
    "in general , the central op can be written in terms of the isovector coupling @xcite as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the isospin of the incident nucleon and @xmath9 is that of the target @xmath10 .",
    "the second term of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , known as the lane potential , contributes to the elastic ( @xmath11 ) and ( @xmath12 ) scattering as well as to the charge exchange ( @xmath13 ) reaction @xcite . while the relative contribution by the lane potential @xmath14 to the elastic nucleon scattering cross section is small and amounts only a few percent for a neutron - rich target @xcite , it determines entirely the ( fermi - type ) @xmath15 transition strength of the reaction to isobaric analog states .",
    "therefore , the reaction can be used as a reliable probe of the isospin dependence of the op .",
    "the op has been studied over the years and there are several",
    " global \" sets of the op parameters deduced from the extensive optical model analyses of nucleon elastic scattering , like that by becchetti and greenlees @xcite , the ch89 global op @xcite , and a recent systematics by koning and delaroche @xcite which covers a wide range of energies ( from 1 kev to 200 mev ) and target masses ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "although parameterized in the empirical woods - saxon form , these global systematics are very valuable in predicting the op when elastic scattering data are not available or can not be measured which is the case for the unstable , dripline nuclei . given a large neutron excess in the unstable neutron - rich nuclei , it is important to know as accurate as possible the isospin dependence of the op before using it in various studies of nuclear reactions and nuclear astrophysics .",
    "we recall here the two main methods used so far to determine the isospin dependence of the op :    \\(i ) study the elastic scattering of proton and neutron from the same target and measured at about the same energy , where the isovector term of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) has the same strength , but opposite signs for @xmath17 and @xmath18 elastic scattering ;    \\(ii ) study the ( isospin - flip ) charge exchange transition between isobaric analog states .",
    "since there are not sufficient high - quality data available for a wide range of target masses and proton energies , the empirical isospin dependence of the op has been deduced @xcite based mainly on method ( i ) .",
    "while these three global nucleon optical potentials have been widely used in predicting the op in numerous direct reaction analyses within the dwba or coupled - channel ( cc ) formalism , their isospin dependence has been rarely used to study the charge exchange transition between the ias s .",
    "the ( phenomenological ) lane potential @xmath14 has been studied in details so far at some particular energies only , like the systematics for @xmath14 deduced from ias data of the reaction measured at 22.8 @xcite and 35 mev @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to have a reliable microscopic prediction for @xmath14 by the folding model , to reduce the uncertainty associated with the isospin dependence of the op .",
    "another very interesting microscopic aspect of the lane potential is that it provides a direct link between the isospin dependence of the in - medium nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath19 ) interaction and the charge exchange reaction , so that accurately measured cross section can serve as a good probe of the isospin dependence of the @xmath19 interaction @xcite if the wave functions of the involved nuclear states are known .",
    "furthermore , within the frame of many - body calculation of nuclear matter ( nm ) , the asymmetry of the nm equation of state ( eos ) depends entirely on the density- and isospin dependence of the @xmath19 interaction @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry is actually determined by the nm symmetry energy @xmath20 which is defined in terms of the nm binding energy @xmath21 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the neutron - proton asymmetry parameter . the contribution of @xmath24 and higher - order terms in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) , i.e. , the deviation from the parabolic law was proven to be negligible @xcite .",
    "the knowledge about the nuclear eos ( [ e2 ] ) is well known to be vital for the understanding of the dynamics of supernova explosion and neutron star formation @xcite .",
    "the nm symmetry energy determined at the saturation density , @xmath25 with @xmath26 @xmath27 , is widely known in the literature as the _ symmetry energy _ or symmetry coefficient .",
    "although numerous nuclear many - body calculations have predicted @xmath28 to be around 30 mev @xcite , a direct experimental determination of @xmath29 still remains a challenging task .",
    "one needs , therefore , to relate @xmath29 to some experimentally inferrable quantity like the neutron skin in neutron - rich nuclei @xcite or fragmentation data of the heavy - ion ( hi ) collisions involving @xmath30 nuclei @xcite . in our recent study of the ias excitation in the 6pn reaction using the folded lane potential @xmath14 for the charge exchange form factor @xcite ,",
    "we have shown how the nm symmetry energy can be linked to the charge exchange transition strength and , hence , be probed in the folding model analysis of the reaction . to extend the folding model study of the reaction to heavier targets to validate the conclusion made in ref .",

    "one can see that @xmath25 is lying somewhat lower than the empirical value of around @xmath116 mev if @xmath117 is taken as determined from the bhf results by jlm @xcite .",
    "the weakness of the jlm isovector interaction is , thus , also confirmed in our hf calculation of asymmetric nm .",
    "a very good agreement with the empirical @xmath28 values is reached when @xmath118 is scaled by a factor @xmath119 , which is slightly larger than factor @xmath120 for @xmath121 at @xmath122 and 45 mev deduced from our folding model analysis of the reaction .",
    "the renormalized strength of the isovector density dependence also gives a good agreement with the empirical symmetry energy at the half - density point , @xmath123 @xmath124 mev , found from recent studies @xcite of the heavy - ion fragmentation in the same energy region as that considered in our study of reactions .",
    "it should be noted that analysis of hi fragmentation data was made based on the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics simulations @xcite which obtained @xmath123 @xmath125 at a _",
    "finite _ temperature of around 3 mev .",
    "therefore , this value approximately agrees with our hf result for the low - density part of @xmath20 shown in fig .",
    "[ f12 ] only if the temperature dependence of @xmath20 at low nm densities is neglected .",
    "finally we note that our results are also complementary to the structure studies which relate the @xmath28 value to the neutron skin , a method first suggested by brown @xcite . if one adopts a neutron - skin @xmath126 fm for @xmath4pb then a systematics based on the mean - field calculations @xcite gives @xmath127 mev ( which is plotted as solid square in fig .  [ f12 ] ) .",
    "although the folding model analysis of the reaction has put a constraint on the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath20 at @xmath128 , its behavior at high densities remains unexplored in our study due to a simple reason that the total nuclear density of the system never exceeds @xmath129 , so that the reaction is sensitive to the low - density part of the isovector interaction only . in particular ,",
    "when the isovector density dependence @xmath130 is taken to have the same functional form as the isoscalar density dependence @xmath82 , and scaled by a factor of 1.1 deduced from our recent cc analysis of the 6pn data @xcite , it gives nearly the same description of the symmetry energy @xmath20 at @xmath128 as the newly parameterized isovector density dependence ( see dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ f12 ] ) .",
    "the two sets of the isovector density dependence have , however , very different behaviors at high nm densities .",
    "the @xmath20 curves obtained with the isovector density dependence based on the bhf results of asymmetric nm increase monotonically with the increasing nm density .",
    "such a behavior has been recently discussed as the _ asy - stiff _ density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , while the @xmath20 curve given by @xmath130 having the same functional form as @xmath82 can be referred to as the _ asy - soft _ density dependence ( see more discussion in ref .",
    "although some hi collision data seem to prefer the stiff density dependence of the symmetry energy @xcite , much more studies need to be done before a definitive conclusion can be made .",
    "in particular , a double - folding approach to study the @xmath131he,@xmath132 ) or @xmath133c,@xmath134n ) reactions exciting ias might allow us to test the high density part of the isovector density dependence ( [ c1 ] ) , due to a higher overlap nuclear density reached during the collision and , eventually , to probe the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath20 at higher nm densities .",
    "a consistent cc analysis of the charge exchange reactions to the isobaric analog states of the ground states of @xmath1ca , @xmath2zr , @xmath3sn and @xmath4pb targets at the proton incident energies of 35 and 45 mev has been done using the form factors either calculated microscopically in the folding model @xcite or determined from the empirical ws parameters of the existing nucleon global op s @xcite .    although the isospin dependence of the ch89 global op @xcite has been established based only on the om studies of the elastic proton and neutron scattering only , it can be used to determine the charge exchange ff for the transition to ias , based the isospin coupling ( [ e3b ] ) .",
    "this ch89 form factor was shown to account quite well for the data if the parameters of the proton op are fine tuned to reproduce the measured elastic proton scattering and total reaction cross sections @xmath135 .    to probe of the isospin dependence of the effective @xmath19 interaction , a complex isovector density dependence of the cdm3y6 interaction",
    "@xcite has been carefully parameterized based on the density dependent jlm nucleon op @xcite and used further in the folding model analysis of the reaction . like previous studies @xcite using the original jlm interaction ( [ c8 ] )",
    ", the present results also show that the isovector strength of the jlm interaction is quite weak to account for the observed transitions .",
    "the cc results obtained with realistic ( semi - microscopic ) nucleon op s for the entrance and exit channels have shown that the real isovector density dependence needs to be enhanced by about @xmath136 to give a good description of the reaction .",
    "the isovector density dependence of the cdm3y6 interaction has also been constructed based on the jlm nucleon op at energy approaching zero for further use in the hf study of asymmetric nm .",
    "the hf calculation using this new isovector interaction gives the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath20 close to the empirical values at @xmath137 when the real isovector density dependence is scaled by a factor @xmath119 .",
    "this result confirms the weakness of the isovector strength of the jlm interaction found in the folding model analysis of the reaction at 35 and 45 mev . the new isovector density dependence predicts a behavior of @xmath20 at high nm densities similar to what discussed recently in the literature @xcite as the _ asy - stiff _ density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
