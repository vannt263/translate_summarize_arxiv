    "a fundamental notion in quantum computing ( qc ) is _ universality _ : a set of quantum logic gates ( unitary transformations ) is said to be `` universal for qc '' if any unitary transformation can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy by a quantum circuit involving only those gates @xcite .",
    "mathematically , this means the ability to efficiently generate a dense subgroup of the group of unitary operations on @xmath0 qubits , @xmath1 .",
    "physically , this is accomplished by carefully manipulating single qubit - external field and ( or only ) qubit - qubit interactions , thus generating unitary gate operations .",
    "a _ universal - gate set _ that accomplishes this , may be continuous , discrete , or both .",
    "a well - known example is the set of all single - qubit gates plus a controlled - phase ( cp ) gate ( that flips the phase of a target qubit depending on the state of a control qubit ) , but many other universal sets are known @xcite .",
    "an important example of a universal gate set , of relevance to us , is the set generated by controlling only _ isotropic _ heisenberg exchange interactions .",
    "this set was shown @xcite to be universal in the context of research on decoherence - free subspaces ( dfss ) @xcite , and requires that a logical qubit be encoded into at least @xmath2 physical qubits @xcite .",
    "efficient gate sequences for universal qc in this case were subsequently presented in ref .",
    "these results assume that all qubits have equal energies",
    ". however , this assumption may break down under magnetic field and/or @xmath3-factor inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "when the resulting zeeman splitting is taken into account , it can be shown that the isotropic heisenberg interaction is universal for qc using an encoding of one logical qubit into only two physical qubits , and efficient gate sequences have been found @xcite .",
    "we describe here a new universal gate set : that generated by the zeeman splitting and the _ anisotropic _ heisenberg interaction , defined more precisely below .",
    "this set is of particular importance to spin - based solid - state approaches to quantum computing @xcite , where anisotropy is inherently present @xcite .",
    "a single spin @xmath4 with magnetic moment @xmath5 couples to a magnetic field @xmath6 oriented along the @xmath7 axis through the zeeman splitting hamiltonian @xmath8 .",
    "this interaction can be spatially controlled by making @xmath6 inhomogeneous @xcite , or by modulating the @xmath3-factor @xcite .",
    "conversely , inhomogeneities and/or a non - uniform @xmath3-factor may be naturally present @xcite .",
    "the zeeman splitting removes the degeneracy of the two spin states and serves to define a physical qubit .",
    "switching on the zeeman term for the @xmath9 qubit causes a phase shift , i.e. , it generates the single - qubit gate @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a controllable parameter ( we use units where @xmath12 ) .",
    "e.g. , a useful gate is @xmath13 , which is a 180@xmath14 rotation about the @xmath7 axis .",
    "the typical switching time of the zeeman splitting is fast : it is similar to that of the heisenberg interaction ( ghz ) , which is the interaction assumed to govern the operation of two - qubit gates in some of the spin - based approaches to quantum computing @xcite .",
    "these qc proposals , as well as schemes for universal qc using the heisenberg interaction alone @xcite rely on this interaction being perfectly isotropic .",
    "however , in a crystal environment that lacks inversion symmetry , the actual interaction between spins @xmath15 and @xmath16 is @xmath17 where only the exchange parameter @xmath18 is directly controllable @xcite .",
    "this means that the isotropic heisenberg interaction @xmath19 itself is _ not _ independently tunable .",
    "the anisotropic part arises from spin - orbit coupling , as a relativistic correction .",
    "as written , the anisotropy parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 are dimensionless ; in systems like coupled gaas quantum dots @xmath22 is of the order of a few percent , while the last term is of the order of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "@xmath24 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hij ] ) is the most general anisotropic exchange interaction that is symmetric about a _ given axis _",
    ", here @xmath20 .",
    "further corrections will be even smaller .",
    "the anisotropic perturbation has been considered a problem and strategies have been designed to cancel it .",
    "e.g. , it can be removed to first order by shaped pulses @xcite , or cancelled in the absence of an external magnetic field @xcite . instead of trying to cancel the anisotropy",
    ", we show here how to use it to our advantage in order to generate a universal gate set .",
    "we first focus on the case of time-_in_dependent @xmath25 and @xmath21 , which should be dominant as discussed recently in ref .",
    "the corrections arising from the time - dependent anisotropic interaction are much weaker , sufficiently so that they are below the threshold for fault tolerant quantum computation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we also consider the time - dependent case below . now , turning on the exchange term @xmath24 generates a unitary evolution @xmath26 through the schrdinger equation , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a second controllable parameter .",
    "we assume that _ we can only use the two parameters _",
    "@xmath29 _ and _ @xmath30 to manipulate computational states and construct a universal gate set . direct control of hamiltonian terms that generate single - qubit rotations about the @xmath31 and @xmath32 axes causes device heating and other major technical problems , so that this type of control is best avoided @xcite .",
    "we thus refer to @xmath33 and the zeeman splitting as the `` available hamiltonians '' .",
    "we now show that using control only over these available hamiltonians suffices to generate universal gate sets for a variety of orientations of the vector @xmath20 .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , the orientation of @xmath20 is expressed in terms of the vector @xmath34 pointing from qubit @xmath15 ( e.g. , the center of the @xmath35 quantum dot ) to qubit @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we can always choose the direction of the magnetic field as the @xmath7 axis . since @xmath36 is a vector in the plane the quantum dots are lying on , if the magnetic field is applied parallel to @xmath20 , it too should be in the plane of the dots ( fig .  [",
    "a more common case is when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the dots ( figs .",
    "1b - d ) . we proceed to analyze each of these four cases .",
    "geometries of magnetic field @xmath37 , relative position of quantum dots @xmath34 , and spin - orbit field @xmath38 , considered in the text .",
    "quantum dots are indicated by shaded circles.,height=491 ]",
    "we first discuss the case in which the magnetic field @xmath37 is parallel to @xmath39 ( @xmath40 @xmath41 , fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) . in this",
    "( and only this ) case it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the effect of the anisotropy may be made to cancel exactly . however , this approach requires precise alignment of @xmath37 along @xmath39 , and utilizes single - qubit @xmath42 interactions for universality , which as discussed above , we seek to avoid here .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath43 case , the available hamiltonians are not universal for qc because they have too much symmetry : @xmath33 and the zeeman splitting both commute with @xmath44 .",
    "there is a simple way to solve the problem : we encode a pair of physical qubit states into a logical qubit :  @xmath45 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for other cases where this encoding proved useful for universality ) . in this manner",
    "the first logical qubit is given by physical qubits @xmath46 , the second by physical qubit @xmath47 , and so on .",
    "a calculation then shows that the _ encoded _ ( denoted by a bar ) single - qubit operations are : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , where the subscript denotes the @xmath51 encoded qubit .",
    "these operators have the same commutation relations as the three components of spin angular momentum [ i.e. , they generate @xmath52 . under our assumption of a controllable zeeman splitting",
    ", we can switch @xmath53 on / off , and hence can perform arbitrary rotations about the @xmath7 axis of the encoded qubit . while we do not have direct access to @xmath54 , the @xmath2-step quantum circuit depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a yields this operation .",
    "diagrams of circuits implementing logical operations in the @xmath43 case .",
    "lines denote physical qubits , time flows from left to right .",
    "the @xmath2-step circuit ( a ) implements the transformation @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 is an arbitrary angle and @xmath57 is a time - independent constant @xcite .",
    "the @xmath58-step circuit ( b ) implements the transformation @xmath59 , where @xmath60 .",
    "the notation used in the diagrams is : @xmath61 , @xmath62.,height=491 ]    the ability to perform arbitrary rotations about the @xmath7 and @xmath31 axes suffices for performing arbitrary single qubit operations , through a standard euler angle contruction @xcite . to complete the universal gate set",
    "we also need a logic gate coupling different encoded qubits in a non - trivial manner , such as a cp gate .",
    "we have previously shown that the interaction @xmath63 between logical qubits @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and which generates a cp  gate between these qubits , is equivalent to the interaction @xmath66 between physical qubits @xmath65 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this can be implemented by the @xmath58-step quantum circuit depicted in fig .",
    "we note that this circuit also provides a way to cancel the anisotropic interaction by controlling the zeeman splitting ( see also ref .",
    "in addition , the encoded qubit is a dfs against collective dephasing errors @xcite , so an automatic layer of error protection is built into these circuits .",
    "we now analyze the more common case where the magnetic field is perpendicular to the @xmath67 plane the quantum dots are on .",
    "first we consider @xmath68 ( or @xmath69 ) , which can be along the direction @xmath70 from qubit @xmath64 to qubit @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) . as shown in the previous case ( of fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) , the isotropic heisenberg interaction and zeeman splitting become universal for qc by using an encoding .",
    "in contrast , as we now show , @xmath33 together with the zeeman splitting are universal _ without encoding_. since @xmath71 is by our assumptions controllable , the problem for single - qubit rotations is to show how to generate @xmath72 .",
    "we will explicitly be using the anisotropic perturbation to this end , so the speed of the @xmath72 gate will be on the order of a few percent of the @xmath71 gate .",
    "this is still reasonable since it is similar to , or even better than , the relative strength of the two - spin interaction and the external radiofrequency magnetic fields in nmr @xcite .    to generate the @xmath72 gate",
    "we first introduce a simple @xmath2-step quantum circuit , that will serve as a building block for other gates : @xmath73 ( note that @xmath74 can be implemented in one parallel step ) .",
    "contrary to its appearance , this gate is actually separable for qubits @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this allows us to use it for creating single - qubit gates , e.g. , the following @xmath75-step circuit : @xmath76 recall that @xmath57 and @xmath77 is fixed ( given ) so that this circuit is _ discrete _ ( only whole multiples of the angle @xmath78 can be generated ) .",
    "alternatively , the following @xmath79-step circuit yields a continuous @xmath72 gate @xcite : @xmath80 with @xmath81 , and continuous angle @xmath82 , controlled in terms of @xmath29 .",
    "however , @xmath83 is bounded because of @xmath84 .",
    "e.g. , its maximum is approximately @xmath85 if @xmath86 therefore , in order to perform exactly a single - qubit @xmath72 gate with larger angle , one can first use @xmath87 to approximate the needed gate and then converge using the @xmath79-step continuous gate .    to complete the discussion of universality",
    "we again need to generate a logic gate coupling qubits .",
    "such a two - qubit operation can be obtained in terms of the following ( not necessarily optimized ) @xmath88-step quantum circuit ,    @xmath89    where the arbitrary angle @xmath90 is controlled in terms of the angle @xmath91 in @xmath33 .",
    "this gate is therefore no longer slow .",
    "note that @xmath92 can be implemented as above by a @xmath79-step quantum circuit",
    ". further note that since _ any _ entangling gate is universal ( together with single - qubit gates ) @xcite , in practice one may be able to reduce our @xmath88-step circuit , e.g. , using geometric time - optimal control methods @xcite .",
    "the general @xmath93 case is where @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 , i.e. , time - independent and somewhere in the @xmath67 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) .",
    "however , this case is equivalent up to a unitary rotation to the @xmath97 case .",
    "specifically , the transformation @xmath98 ( where @xmath99 ) , rotates @xmath38 so that it becomes parallel to @xmath100 . the treatment above then applies provided we everywhere replace @xmath101 by @xmath102 .",
    "it is noteworthy that in the present case of time - independent @xmath20 , similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite where efficient gate sequences for the isotropic heisenberg interaction were obtained , we did not employ the short - time approximation , i.e. , made use only of finite time steps .",
    "in contrast to the numerically derived circuits of ref .",
    "@xcite , our circuits are based on analytical results , and can be understood using elementary angular momentum theory @xcite .",
    "finally , we also consider the general case with @xmath20 and @xmath21 both time - dependent , @xmath103 in the @xmath67 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]d ) .",
    "in contrast to the time - independent case , gates now have to be implemented using the short - time approximation : @xmath104 for operators @xmath105 and @xmath106 that do not necessarily commute , and @xmath107 . while this is less accurate than the exact circuits given above , it is nevertheless a valuable and common tool in discussions of universality @xcite .",
    "the short - time evolution operator  corresponding to @xmath33 has the same form as before : @xmath108 with @xmath109 , except that now @xmath110 is an average value of the coupling constant in the time interval from @xmath111 to @xmath112 .",
    "assuming that all time - dependent parameters do not vary appreciably within the short time @xmath113 , a two - qubit cp gate is given by the repeated @xmath58-step circuit @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "the approximation improves with increasing @xmath116 . since @xmath117",
    "we only need to know the detailed properties of the evolution operator around time zero .",
    "next we must generate the single - qubit @xmath72 gate .",
    "to do so we combine a short - time and a finite - time circuit .",
    "first , @xmath118 where @xmath119 and we have used the short - time approximation . then the single - qubit @xmath72 gate is given in terms of the following circuit : @xmath120 this completes the generation of single - qubit gates , and thus proves universality of our available interactions in the time - dependent case .",
    "a discussion of universal quantum computation is incomplete without a consideration of decoherence , the process whereby quantum information is degraded through the interaction of qubits with their environment . in principle three of the major methods for resisting decoherence , quantum error correcting codes @xcite , dfss @xcite , and fast / strong `` bang - bang '' ( bb ) pulses",
    "@xcite are compatible with our universality results .",
    "as mentioned above , in the case of @xmath121 we have used an encoding into a dfs that is automatically resistant to collective dephasing errors .",
    "we have recently shown how , starting from a general ( linear ) system - bath coupling , to actively create the conditions for collective decoherence by applying bb pulses generated by the isotropic heisenberg interaction @xcite . in this case",
    "an encoding into a @xmath2- or @xmath58-qubit dfs is possible , which resists the remaining collective errors .",
    "leakage errors ( which would arise due to corrections to the short - time approximation invoked in bb theory ) can likewise be eliminated using only the isotropic heisenberg interaction @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that the same ( creation of collective decoherence , leakage elimination ) should be possible using the available interactions we considered here . even without encoding ,",
    "the use of bb pulses should serve to significantly enhance the robustness of our circuits under decoherence .",
    "we further note that some of our circuits already have a form of decoherence - resistance built into them .",
    "e.g. , the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : short - t - cphase ] ) is that of a parity - kick operation @xcite , which implies that this circuit eliminates all hamiltonians ( including system - bath ) containing system operators which anti - commute with @xmath74 and @xmath122 or @xmath123 .",
    "in fact the same consideration shows that this circuit also eliminates the undesired anisotropic interaction in the more complicated case in which the strength of the anisotropic interaction is not proportional to that of the heisenberg interaction .",
    "we have introduced a new set of universal hamiltonians : the zeeman splitting and anistropic heisenberg interaction .",
    "this set is of direct relevance to quantum computing in solid state systems that rely on spin - spin interactions @xcite . until recently , most studies of such systems assumed an isotropic heisenberg interaction , which , however , is an approximation due to spin - orbit coupling and other perturbations @xcite . instead of trying to cancel the resulting anisotropy @xcite",
    ", we showed here how to advantageously use the anisotropy .",
    "we analytically derived circuits which implement universal quantum logic in a variety of geometries of interest , for both time - independent and time - dependent perturbations . in the former case ,",
    "depending on geometry and type of gate implemented , these circuits come with an overhead of between @xmath2 and at most @xmath88 extra pulses .",
    "we hope that the methods presented here will enhance the prospects of quantum information processing in those promising quantum computing proposals where the inherent anisotropy of the exchange interaction can not be ignored .",
