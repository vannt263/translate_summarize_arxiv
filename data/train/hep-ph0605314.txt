    "recent studies on cosmology have almost unanimously confirmed the existence of dark matter ( dm ) in our universe with a fraction @xmath6 of the critical density @xcite .",
    "however , the identity of the dm still remains to be a mystery .",
    "future dm direct and indirect detection experiments and collider experiments will attempt to pin down the properties of the dm candidates and the underlying theories . among various proposed candidates in the literature ,",
    "the most studied one is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp , usually the lightest neutralino ) of supersymmetric theories ( susy ) .",
    "recently , another class of models based on little higgs models @xcite imposed with a @xmath0-parity @xcite provides an alternative dm candidate . in these models ,",
    "all the standard model particles are assigned with an even @xmath0-parity , while all the new particles proposed are assigned with an odd @xmath0-parity , except for the little higgs partner of the top quark . because of the @xmath0-parity assignment the lightest @xmath0-odd particle ( ltp ) is stable and hence a potential candidate to account for the dm of the universe @xcite .",
    "we note that electroweak precision measurements have placed severe constraints on earlier attempts of constructing the little higgs models without @xmath0-parity @xcite . imposing a discrete @xmath0-parity in the little higgs models",
    "therefore opens a much wider window for theorists to explore various phenomenologies of this class of models @xcite .    in little higgs models with @xmath0-parity ,",
    "the ltp is usually the @xmath1 , the corresponding heavy little higgs partner of the @xmath7 field of the @xmath8 symmetry . and @xmath9 fields are the mass eigenstates of @xmath10 and @xmath11 fields after a rotation by an angle analogous to the weinberg angle , but the rotation in the present case is highly suppressed by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 tev is the high scale where @xmath14 ^ 2 \\rightarrow su_l(2 ) \\times u_y(1)$ ] in the little higgs models and @xmath15 gev is the vev to break @xmath16 .",

    "it has been shown @xcite that in order for the ltp to account for all the dm of the universe , the mass @xmath17 of @xmath1 is related to the higgs boson mass @xmath18 by @xcite @xmath19 this mass relation between @xmath18 and @xmath17 clearly indicates that the dominant annihilation channel is via an @xmath20-channel higgs boson : @xmath21 .",
    "twice the mass of @xmath1 must be located at either side of the higgs boson peak , @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath23 is located right at the higgs boson mass , the annihilation would be too strong to provide a sufficient relic density for the dm .",
    "therefore , @xmath23 must falls on either side of the higgs boson mass such that the annihilation cross section has just the right size to produce the correct relic density for dm .",
    "this is somewhat a fine - tuned mechanism .",
    "perhaps a slightly more natural domain of the parameter space is a region where the coannihilation of the ltp @xmath24 and the @xmath0-odd partner of light quark @xmath2 becomes strong .",

    "we consider the associated production of @xmath28 , followed by the decay @xmath29 , which will give rise to monojet plus missing energy events , as well as the direct production of @xmath4 , which gives rise to the dijet plus missing energy signal .",
    "one can argue that using monojet plus missing energy events one can at least partially distinguish little higgs models with @xmath0-parity from minimal susy models with @xmath30-parity .",
    "some of the reasons are ( i ) monojet events arising from @xmath31 , followed by @xmath32 with the lightest neutralino @xmath33 as the lsp , is expected to be suppressed by the coupling .",
    "thus , the dominant channels for producing susy particles are qcd production of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "they tend to give multijet ( @xmath37 ) plus missing energy events ; ( ii ) the dominant mechanism for producing @xmath0-odd particles are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , which give rise to monojet and dijet , respectively , plus missing energy events .",
    "therefore , by counting how many jets in multijet plus missing energy events , one may be able to differentiate between little higgs models with @xmath0-parity and minimal susy models .",
