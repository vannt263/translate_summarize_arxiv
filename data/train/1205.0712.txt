    "the list of shape invariant potentials has remained quite the same until 2008 .",
    "then , key contributions of gmez - ullate et al . led to a quick and strong development of the subject in recent years .",
    "the first steps were the possibility of rationally extend shape - invariant potentials ( to obtain non shape invariant ones ) @xcite .",
    "then , the introduction of the so called @xmath1 exceptional laguerre and jacobi polynomials @xcite fostered all subsequent works . by the one hand , quesne ( and coworkers ) @xcite introduced the first examples of rationally extended shape invariant potentials .",
    "this idea has been greatly developed by odake and sasaki @xcite to infinitely many families of rationally extended shape - invariant potentials , even with functions depending on continuous index @xmath2 and multi - indexed polynomials .",
    "they have also extended these ideas to the context of discrete quantum mechanics ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "other works by grandati @xcite have a close relation with the ones cited .",
    "on the other hand , the works @xcite inspired our recent article @xcite , where a compatibility condition has been found that is satisfied by the new examples . even we have shown that such a condition forces the shape invariance of the examples treated there .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xcite are preceded by @xcite .",
    "this paper continues on the same line of study and shows that the examples of @xcite fit perfectly in our framework , satisfying the mentioned compatibility condition .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in the second section we recall the equations which satisfy the new translational shape invariant potentials of @xcite .",
    "we prove the equivalence between a generalization of the cited compatibility condition and the usual shape invariance condition .",
    "afterwards , we comment on the isospectrality properties of the potentials involved . in the third section",
    "we describe how the examples of @xcite fit into our framework .",
    "we obtain as a byproduct new relations , to the best of our knowledge , for laguerre , jacobi polynomials and ( confluent ) hypergeometric functions . in the fourth and last section",
    "we offer some conclusions .",
    "for a brief account of shape invariance , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein . in the examples of @xcite",
    "the superpotential function takes the form of w(x , a)=w_0(x , a)+w_1+(x , a)-w_1-(x , a ) , [ wgen ] where @xmath3 denotes the set of parameters under transformation .",
    "@xmath4 is the superpotential of a pair of shape invariant partner potentials of the classical type .",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 are logarithmic derivatives which moreover satisfy @xmath7 where @xmath8 in those cases is a translation of @xmath3",
    ".    the corresponding partner potentials for ( [ wgen ] ) are v(x , a)&=&w_0 ^ 2(x , a)-w_0^(x , a ) + & & + w_1+^2(x , a)+w_1+^(x , a ) + w_1-^2(x , a)+w_1-^(x , a ) + & & -2w_0(x , a)w_1-(x , a)+2w_0(x , a)w_1+(x , a ) + & & -2w_1-(x , a)w_1+(x , a)-2w_1+^(x , a ) [ vcom ] + v(x , a)&=&w_0 ^",
    "2(x , a)+w_0^(x , a ) + & & + w_1+^2(x , a)+w_1+^(x , a ) + w_1-^2(x , a)+w_1-^(x , a ) + & & -2w_0(x , a)w_1-(x , a)+2w_0(x , a)w_1+(x , a ) + & & -2w_1-(x , a)w_1+(x , a)-2w_1-^(x , a ) [ vtilcom ] however , for the examples of @xcite such partner potentials reduce to v(x , a)&=&v_0(x , a)-2w_1+^(x , a ) , [ vg ] + v(x , a)&=&v_0(x , a)-2w_1-^(x , a ) , [ tilvg ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 conform the pair of shape invariant partner potentials associated to @xmath4 . thus , it is in principle necessary that the following _ compatibility condition _ holds : @xmath11 ( the dependence on the arguments has been omitted for brevity ) .",
    "such compatibility condition is the main object of our interest here .",
    "first we will discuss a kind of symmetries of the problems of type ( [ wgen ] ) , ( [ sic2 ] ) , ( [ vcom ] ) , ( [ vtilcom ] ) .",
    "afterwards we establish the relation between a generalized compatibility condition and the ordinary shape invariance condition .",
    "there exist a class of symmetries of superpotentials of type ( [ wgen ] ) which satisfy the condition ( [ sic2 ] ) given by the transformations w_1+(x , a)&=&u_1+(x , a)-g(x ) [ trw1p ] + w_1-(x , a)&=&u_1-(x , a)-g(x ) [ trw1 m ] where @xmath12 is a function _ depending only on @xmath13_. the function @xmath12 must be differentiable in the domain of interest but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "for example , @xmath12 could be any polynomial , @xmath14 , etc .",
    "thus we have @xmath15 the corresponding partner potentials ( [ vcom ] ) , ( [ vtilcom ] ) are likewise invariant under ( [ trw1p ] ) and ( [ trw1 m ] ) . however , their different terms do vary , in such a way that their variations cancel out .",
    "firstly , we have & & w_1+^2+w_1+^+w_1-^2+w_1-^ -2w_0w_1-+2w_0w_1 + -2w_1-w_1 + + & & = u_1+^2+u_1+^+u_1-^2+u_1-^ -2w_0u_1-+2w_0u_1 + -2u_1-u_1 + + & & -2g^(x ) and moreover -2w_1+^(x , a)&=&-2u_1+^(x , a)+2g^(x ) + -2w_1-^(x , a)&=&-2u_1-^(x , a)+2g^(x ) therefore , if ( [ cc1 ] ) holds , we have & & u_1+^2(x , a)+u_1+^(x , a ) + u_1-^2(x , a)+u_1-^(x , a ) + & & -2w_0(x , a)u_1-(x , a)+2w_0(x , a)u_1+(x , a)-2u_1-(x , a)u_1+(x , a ) = 2g^(x ) this means that by virtue of a symmetry of the problem , the compatibility condition ( [ cc1 ] ) should be generalized in such a way that its right hand side could be a function of @xmath13 not necessarily equal to zero .",
    "this observation leads to our main result in the following subsection .      for the class of problems described in this letter",
    ", there is an equivalence between the mentioned generalized compatibility condition and the usual shape invariance condition , as described in the next theorem .",
    "assume we have a superpotential of the type w(x , a)=w_0(x , a)+w_1+(x , a)-w_1-(x , a ) , where @xmath16 @xmath8 being the transformation on the parameters @xmath3 , and @xmath4 satisfies the shape invariance condition @xmath17 then , the shape invariant condition for @xmath18 w^2(x , a)-w^2(x , f(a))+w^(x , f(a))+w^(x , a)=r(f(a))[siwt ] holds if and only if & & w_1+^2(x , a)+w_1+^(x , a)+w_1-^2(x , a)+w_1-^(x , a ) + & & -2w_0(x , a)w_1-(x , a)+2w_0(x , a)w_1+(x , a)-2w_1-(x , a)w_1+(x , a ) + & & = ( x ) [ cidelta ] for some non - singular function @xmath19 of @xmath13 only .",
    "_ proof _    the condition of shape invariance ( [ siwt ] ) reads in this case @xmath20 - 2w_{1-}^{\\prime}(x , a ) + 2w_{1+}^{\\prime}(x , f(a))=0\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\label{gor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the hypothesis that @xmath4 satisfies ( [ siw0 ] ) , also that @xmath21 and that & & w_1+^2(x , a)+w_1+^(x , a)+w_1-^2(x , a)+w_1-^(x , a ) + & & -2w_0(x , a)w_1-(x , a)+2w_0(x , a)w_1+(x , a)-2w_1-(x , a)w_1+(x , a ) + & & = ( x ) + & & w_1+^2(x , f(a))+w_1+^(x , f(a))+w_1-^2(x , f(a ) ) + w_1-^(x , f(a ) ) + & & -2w_0(x , f(a))w_1-(x , f(a))+2w_0(x , f(a))w_1+(x , f(a ) ) + & & -2w_1-(x , f(a))w_1+(x , f(a ) ) + & & = ( x)the shape invariance condition is readily satisfied .",
    "conversely , with the above hypothesis we assume that the shape invariance condition ( [ siwt ] ) is satisfied , therefore ( [ gor ] ) is also satisfied . taking into account",
    "( [ siw0 ] ) and @xmath21 and rearranging , ( [ gor ] ) becomes @xmath22 that is , the expression evaluated at @xmath23 equals the expression itself evaluated at @xmath24 , thus both expressions must be equal to a function of @xmath13 only , namely , @xmath19 .",
    "this ends the proof of the theorem .",
    "_ remarks _    \\1 . in actual examples",
    "it is observed that ( [ cidelta ] ) is satisfied with @xmath25 , which is a slightly stronger condition that in particular implies shape invariance .",
    "note that ho proposes in @xcite a similar form to the superpotential ( [ wgen ] ) , but that approach is different : other relations , different from ( [ cc1 ] ) or ( [ cidelta ] ) are satisfied .",
    "as an example of this , in @xcite it is shown that the harmonic oscillator and the morse potential admit no non - trivial extensions by our means .",
    "however with the technique of ho they do .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "we observe that the potentials in ( [ vg ] ) and ( [ tilvg ] ) are related by construction by a first order intertwining relation as described in section  2 of @xcite with superpotential ( [ wgen ] ) .",
    "the fulfillment of condition ( [ cc1 ] ) provides a cancelation of some of their terms ( it is the same condition for @xmath26 in ( [ vg ] ) and @xmath27 in ( [ tilvg ] ) ) .",
    "thus the isospectrality ( maybe up to the ground state of one of them ) of the potentials ( [ vg ] ) and ( [ tilvg ] ) is ensured .",
    "see @xcite for a group theoretical explanation of the intertwining technique .",
    "another question is the isospectrality of the mentioned potentials with the ordinary shape invariant potentials @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this is also easy to justify : with the conditions ( [ sic2 ] ) and ( [ cidelta ] ) the shape invariant relation ( [ siwt ] ) for the potentials of ( [ vg ] ) and ( [ tilvg ] ) becomes identical to that of the partner potentials @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in particular , the quantity @xmath28 , from which the spectrum of the potentials is calculated , is identical in both cases , showing the mentioned isospectrality ( maybe up to the ground state of one of them ) .",
    "see also @xcite for an approximation to such an isospectrality based on the intertwining technique .",
    "we have established that the generalized compatibility condition ( [ cidelta ] ) is equivalent to the ordinary shape invariance condition ( [ siwt ] ) in the mentioned circumstances .",
    "however , the former condition is simpler to work with than the latter for the cases studied in @xcite and in this letter .",
    "the condition ( [ cc1 ] ) has been shown , for @xmath29 satisfying the bernoulli equation @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 , etc . ) , in the examples of @xcite , to imply ( [ sic2 ] ) in particular .",
    "this means that such conditions are not really independent in specific examples .",
    "the compatibility condition ( [ cidelta ] ) admits another , even simpler , form .",
    "denoting @xmath32 it becomes @xmath33 where the dependence on the arguments @xmath23 has been dropped for simplicity .",
    "for the case of @xmath25 it follows @xmath34    in terms of the functions @xmath35 , the symmetries of subsection  [ symt ] are expressed in the following way .",
    "the functions change as _ 1+(x ,",
    "a)&=&(-g(x)dx)_1+(x , a ) + _ 1-(x , a)&=&(-g(x)dx ) _ 1-(x , a ) where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "in this section we study the fulfillment of the compatibility condition ( [ cc12 ] ) for the examples of @xcite .",
    "these cases are specially well suited for our purposes , since they take the form of section  [ eccsic ] and are known to be shape invariant . by the symmetry property of these problems , it suffices to study the compatibility condition ( [ cc12 ] ) , which will be obtained directly in all cases .",
    "we will obtain as a byproduct new relations , to the best of our knowledge , of laguerre , jacobi polynomials and ( confluent ) hypergeometric functions .        according to @xcite , the extended partner potentials of the radial oscillator have a superpotential of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are laguerre polynomials .",
    "we will try to check ( [ cc12 ] ) directly choosing ( with a slight abuse of notation ) @xmath42 and by writing it in another way , using the relation ( 2.41 ) of @xcite , namely ( dependence on arguments dropped ) @xmath43 thus the relation ( [ cc12 ] ) becomes @xmath44 this last relation can be proved using the equations ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 ) of @xcite .",
    "that implies , in particular , the fulfillment of ( [ siwt ] ) for this case .",
    "in @xcite it is proved ( [ siwt ] ) directly for the current case .",
    "the relations ( [ cc12 ] ) and ( [ cc12ro ] ) are new , and equivalent to each other , for laguerre polynomials .      according to @xcite ,",
    "the extended partner potentials of the trigonometric darboux - pschl - teller potential have a superpotential of the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are jacobi polynomials .",
    "we will try to check ( [ cc12 ] ) by choosing ( with a slight abuse of the notation ) @xmath49 moreover , we transform ( [ cc12 ] ) by using the relation ( 2.41 ) of @xcite , namely @xmath50 thus , the relation ( [ cc12 ] ) becomes @xmath51 such relation can be proved directly using ( 3.12 ) and ( 3.13 ) of @xcite .",
    "in such a paper , it has been proved the shape invariance condition ( [ siwt ] ) directly .",
    "we have proved it checking that the stronger ( and simpler ) condition ( [ cc12 ] ) or ( [ cc12tpt ] ) holds .    for this case ,",
    "( [ cc12 ] ) and ( [ cc12tpt ] ) are new relations , equivalent to each other , for jacobi polynomials .      according to @xcite ,",
    "the extended partner potentials of the hyperbolic darboux - pschl - teller potential have a superpotential of the form @xmath52 where @xmath39 , @xmath53 and @xmath48 are again jacobi polynomials .",
    "we will try to check ( [ cc12 ] ) by choosing @xmath54 and transforming the cited condition by using the relation ( 2.41 ) of @xcite , namely @xmath55 thus the relation ( [ cc12 ] ) becomes @xmath56 this last relation can be proved by using equations ( 3.12 ) and ( 3.13 ) of @xcite , as in the previous case .",
    "therefore , the shape invariance for this case holds in particular . in @xcite , the relation ( [ siwt ] )",
    "has been proved directly .    for this case ,",
    "( [ cc12 ] ) and ( [ cc12hpt ] ) are new relations , equivalent to each other , for jacobi polynomials .        according to @xcite ,",
    "the extended partner potentials of the radial oscillator with continuous @xmath57 have a superpotential of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 are the confluent hypergeometric and gamma functions , respectively .",
    "we choose ( with a slight abuse of notation ) @xmath42 in order to check whether ( [ cc12 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "we first transform it by using the relation ( 3.9 ) of @xcite , namely ( [ pp_ro ] ) and ( [ pm_ro ] ) .",
    "therefore , ( [ cc12 ] ) is transformed into ( [ cc12ro ] ) again .",
    "such relation can be proved again for the current @xmath61 by using properties ( 3.10 ) and ( 3.11 ) of @xcite . thus the compatibility condition holds and as a result",
    "also the shape invariance condition does .",
    "this last result has been obtained directly in @xcite .    for this case ,",
    "( [ cc12 ] ) and ( [ cc12ro ] ) are new relations , equivalent to each other , for confluent hypergeometric functions .      according to @xcite ,",
    "the extended partner potentials of the trigonometric darboux - pschl - teller potential with continuous @xmath57 have a superpotential of the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the hypergeometric function .",
    "we denote again @xmath49 in order to check that ( [ cc12 ] ) holds .",
    "we transform it first using the result ( 3.9 ) of @xcite , namely @xmath64 thus the relation ( [ cc12 ] ) becomes @xmath65 this last equation can be proved directly using the equations ( 3.10 ) and ( 3.11 ) of @xcite , thus fulfilling the compatibility condition . as a consequence , ( [ siwt ] ) holds ( something which has been checked directly in @xcite ) .    for this case ,",
    "( [ cc12 ] ) and ( [ cc12t2f1pt ] ) are new relations amongst hypergeometric functions equivalent to each other .",
    "we have studied the fulfillment of the compatibility condition introduced in @xcite in the cases of the extended shape invariant potentials of @xcite .",
    "firstly , we have proved that for the form of the superpotential ( [ wgen ] ) , where @xmath4 generates a pair of shape invariant potentials of the classical type and the extra terms satisfy ( [ sic2 ] ) , the compatibility condition ( [ cidelta ] ) is equivalent to the ordinary shape invariance condition for the full superpotential ( [ siwt ] ) .",
    "then , the cited examples are exactly of the form described in section  [ eccsic ] .",
    "we check directly whether the compatibility condition ( [ cc12 ] ) holds and indeed we prove it in all cases , using previous results of @xcite .",
    "thus , for the cases studied we provide an alternative and simpler way of proving shape invariance .",
    "the multi - index polynomial extensions to the radial oscillator and trigonometric darboux - pschl - teller potentials introduced in @xcite are shown to be shape invariant and they are of the form described in section  [ eccsic ] , thus the compatibility condition ( [ cidelta ] ) must hold in that cases as well",
    ".    it would be interesting to see whether there exists non - trivial rational extensions to other shape invariant potentials of the infeld and hull classification @xcite ( with superpotential of the type @xmath66 ) to infinitely many polynomial and continuous @xmath0 functions analogous to that of @xcite .",
    "if these examples do exist , the relation ( [ cidelta ] ) must hold again .",
    "we acknowledge correspondence with r. sasaki , where he advanced us the fulfillment of relation ( [ cc1 ] ) for some of their cases and made helpful remarks in a previous version of this paper .",
