    "cosmological @xmath4 body simulations are the primary instrument used to make theoretical predictions for structure formation in current models of the universe",
    ". analytical understanding of the non - linear regime , crucial for many non - trivial tests of these models , remains very poor despite the many phenomenological results derived in simulations .",
    "better understanding of the physics of non - linear clustering could help to better constrain and control cosmological simulations , which despite their ever increasing power and sophistication are still subject to questions about their accuracy and resolution . in this work we use",
    "simplified one dimensional ( 1d )  toy models \" of the full three dimensional ( 3d ) problem to study non - linear structure formation .",
    "more specifically we study , using a family of such models , how the properties of non - linear clustering depend on both initial conditions and cosmology .",
    "our main result is that , for cold initial conditions , we observe that the large phase space of initial conditions and cosmology we explore breaks up into two parts : on the one hand , a region in which there is an apparent `` universality '' of the non - linear clustering , i.e. , in which it depends very weakly both on initial conditions and on the cosmological expansion ; and on the other hand , a region where the non - linear clustering depends strongly on both the initial conditions and expansion history . in the latter region ,",
    "the exponent characterizing the two point correlations is in excellent agreement with a simple analytical prediction which follows from the so - called stable clustering hypothesis , appropriately generalized to this class of models .",
    "further the apparently well localized boundary dividing the phase space into these two disjoint regions can in fact be characterized using the stable clustering prediction , in terms of a critical value of the corresponding exponent .",
    "the non - linear clustering appears to be strictly universal in the limit in which there is no expansion , but also very well approximated for steeper initial spectra when there is expansion .",
    "we compare our results with those in three dimensions , and discuss how our results may provide a framework for understanding the much discussed apparent  universality \" of halo profiles in this context .    the exploration of 1d models as a tool for understanding the physics of non - linear structure formation in a cosmological context goes back at least as far as the work of @xcite for the case of hot dark matter models .",
    "different initial conditions and variants of the model have been discussed by a number of other authors @xcite .",
    "there is also an extensive literature on the statistical mechanics of finite one dimensional self - gravitating systems ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , as well as some studies which use this case to explore issues in cosmological n body simulations : @xcite uses it to probe discreteness effects , and @xcite the issue of universality in cold collapse .",
    "the study reported here is a direct continuation of that in @xcite .",
    "this latter paper showed , for the three 1d models studied in the previous literature , the very strong qualitative similarities in the temporal development of clustering to that in the 3d case .",
    "for cold cosmological like initial conditions clustering is hierachical and driven by the linear amplification of fluctuations , leading , for the case of power law initial conditions , to self similar evolution of the non - linear correlations .",
    "the exponent characterising the non - linear clustering was , further , found to be in very good agreement with that predicted by the so - called  stable clustering \" hypothesis . in this paper",
    "we extend this study to a one parameter family of models which allows continuous interpolation between the static model and the two expanding models previously considered .",
    "this allows us to probe fully the extent of validity of stable clustering , where it breaks down and what happens in this case .",
    "the study reveals that there is a fairly abrupt switchover from the validity of stable clustering to an apparent universality in the clustering .    in the next section",
    "we define the class of 1d models we study , discussing also their relation to 3d cosmological models .",
    "this presentation improves and simplifies that given in @xcite . for the family of scale - free models we focus on",
    ", we derive , more rigorously than in @xcite , the prediction for the behaviour of an isolated structure and use it to derive the exponents predicted for the non - linear two point correlation when the stable clustering hypothesis is made . in the following section we discuss our numerical simulations , and in particular how we calibrate them using  exact \" simulations .",
    "the next section gives our results , and in the last section we discuss their interpretation and possible relation to the three dimensional problem .",
    "the class of 1d models we study are defined as follows .",
    "we take the equations of motion _ in comoving coordinates _ of 3d cosmological @xmath4 body simulations , and simply replace the 3d newtonian gravitational interaction with the 1d gravitational interaction .",
    "this gives 1d equations of motion @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the particle positions on the line .",
    "the superscript ` j ' in the force term indicates that the sum , which extends over an infinite distribution of masses with non - zero mean mass density , is regularized , just as in 3d , by subtraction of the contribution of the mean mass density , i.e. , the force term is sourced only by fluctuations about the mean density . as we will discuss further below this sum",
    "can be written explicitly in a simple manner .",
    "the coupling @xmath7 is the 1d analogy of newton s constant ( multiplied by the particle mass ) . to establish a more direct relation between the 1d and 3d models",
    ", one can consider the  particles \" in the 1d system to represent infinite parallel sheets of zero thickness embedded in 3d . in this case one",
    "has the identification @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the surface mass density of the sheets .",
    "the mean ( comoving ) mass density @xmath10 of the corresponding 3d universe and the number density @xmath11 of the 1d system are then related as @xmath12 , and therefore @xmath13 for any given 3d cosmological model which provides a scale factor @xmath14 and associated hubble constant @xmath15 we then have a _ unique _ corresponding 1d model .",
    "the case @xmath16 ( and @xmath17 ) on the other hand , defines a model analogous to a 3d universe without expansion ( which is well defined but does not correspond to a cosmological model derived from general relativity ) .",
    "the one parameter family of models we will study is a _ continuous interpolation between the 1d model obtained using the 3d eds cosmology , and the static model_. to define them precisely , and motivate their choice , it is convenient to change time variable in eq .",
    "( [ 1deom1 ] ) defining @xmath18 .",
    "this gives the equations of motion in the form @xmath19 i.e. , in which all effects of the cosmology appear only as a fluid type damping term , with @xmath20 for a 3d eds universe with comoving mass density @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath21 where @xmath22 , we obtain a @xmath23 which is _ independent of time _ and given by @xmath24 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ g - grelation ] ) to derive the last equality . in a @xmath25cdm cosmology ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath23 is approximately constant through the matter dominated era and increases slightly at late times .",
    "we consider here simply the set of 1d models in which @xmath23 takes any constant value , and the focus of our study is the dependence of non - linear clustering on this parameter , as well as on the initial conditions .",
    "@xmath23 can simply be considered as a control parameter for understanding the role of expansion in the determination of the properties of the non - linear clustering .",
    "while most previous studies have considered either the eds model ( also known as the  quintic \" model for reasons which will be recalled below ) , or the static model , one other model in this family , corresponding to the case @xmath26 , introduced in @xcite , has been studied in @xcite as well as in @xcite .",
    "we note , using eq .",
    "( [ gamma - a - relation ] ) , that this class of models is obtained by taking the functional dependence of the 3d eds expansion law , but allowing a freedom in the normalisation of the expansion rate to the matter density , i.e. , we can obtain these models taking @xmath27 where @xmath2 is a positive constant .",
    "( [ gamma - a - relation ] ) then still holds , and thus @xmath28 , but instead of ( [ gamma - eds ] ) we have , using eq .  ( [ g - grelation ] ) , that @xmath29 in terms of 3d cosmological models the case @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 , can be considered to be a model in which there is not just  ordinary \" matter but an additional pressureless component of the energy density which does not cluster , e.g. , a homogeneous scalar field with appropriate equation of state ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "equivalently one can consider that the @xmath32 models are obtained using the  correct \" normalisation for the hubble constant , @xmath33 , but choosing the 1d coupling freely instead of imposing the relation eq .",
    "( [ g - grelation ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that , given that 3d hubble law is imposed  by hand \" on the 1d model , there is in principle no correct value for @xmath23 .",
    "our point of view here is simply to use @xmath23 ( or @xmath2 ) as a control parameter in trying to understand the role of expansion in non - linear structure formation . in other words",
    "we are seeking to improve our _ qualitative _ understanding only through the study of these toy models .",
    "in the context of the problem of structure formation the family of models we study has the interest of being , like eds models and static models in 3d , scale - free : the expansion introduces no additional time or length scales .",
    "this has as a consequence that , for cold particles with initial density fluctuations with a power law spectrum , one expects to obtain , at sufficiently long times , temporal evolution which is  self - similar \" , i.e. , the evolution in time of the spatial correlation functions is equivalent to a simple time dependent rescaling of the spatial variables .",
    "the reason why this occurs is that there is , in this case , only a single physically relevant length scale in the problem : the scale at which fluctuations are of order one , of which the evolution is predicted by linear theory .",
    "further if the clustering in the strongly non - linear regime does not depend on this scale one would expect to obtain a scale - free behaviour of spatial correlations in this regime .",
    "such power law behaviour has been observed in both expanding ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) and static 3d simulations @xcite for a range of power law initial conditions .",
    "3d simulations , however , can show such behaviour over a very limited spatial range , making it difficult to establish if it is associated with a true scale invariance of the non - linear clustering .",
    "the study of 1d models in the family we are considering @xcite , with much greater spatial resolution and numerical accuracy , shows very convincing evidence that these models do indeed give rise to power - law clustering indicative of truly scale - invariant clustering .",
    "a central problem of non - linear structure formation is then that of understanding how the exponent ( or possibly exponents ) characterizing the non - linear clustering is determined . in 3d eds cosmology peebles ( see @xcite ) proposed many years ago a simple explanation of how such scale invariant clustering might arise : if highly non - linear structures ( of all different sizes ) are supposed to evolve essentially independently after their formation , they will virialize and remain stable in physical coordinates . from this",
    "one may derive an exponent which depends only on the exponent in the power spectrum of initial density fluctuations .",
    "we derive here now , more rigorously than the heuristic derivation given in @xcite , the prediction of such a stable clustering hypothesis for the 1d models we study .",
    "to do so we simply derive and then analyse the equations of motion of a finite sub - system .      in the simulations which we consider here , we start , as in 3d cosmological simulations , from a particle configuration generated by applying small displacements to an _",
    "infinite _ perfect lattice configuration . at any moment in time",
    "such a configuration can be fully specified by giving the displacements @xmath34 of particles from the sites of a perfect lattice .",
    "the position of the @xmath35-th particle with respect to some arbitrary origin , is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 . in a particle labelling with @xmath38 for all @xmath35 ,",
    "the displacements are uniquely defined , and such that no two particles cross when they are applied to the lattice . in this case",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the force on the particle @xmath35 , given by the sum on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ 1deom2 ] ) , with an appropriate specification of the regularisation , has the simple _ exact _ expression @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the average particle displacement .",
    "this result has been shown for an infinite system with statistically translationally invariant displacements in @xcite , with the sole assumption of decay of correlations of the displacements at asymptotically large scales .",
    "the same result has been shown to hold in @xcite for the case of an infinite _ periodic _ system , using an appropriate regularisation of an ewald summation . in this case , as we will now show explicitly , the expression ( [ 1d - exact - force - disp ] ) can be written as @xmath41 + 2gn_0[x_i - \\langle x \\rangle_p ]   \\label{1d - force - periodic}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is the number of particles in the periodic cell to the left ( right ) of particle @xmath35 , and @xmath44 is the average particle position , i.e. , centre of mass of the particles in the cell .",
    "let us consider now any _ finite _ subsystem @xmath45 of the infinite system defined simply by the @xmath4 particles , with @xmath46 say , in some interval @xmath47 $ ] at a given instant in time , substituting @xmath48 in ( [ 1d - exact - force - disp ] ) , and noting that the number of particles in the interval to the left ( right ) of the @xmath35th particle is given by @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , we obtain that the force on the particle @xmath35 may be written @xmath51 + 2gn_0[x_i - \\langle x \\rangle_{\\cal",

    ". if the subsystem chosen is the periodic cell of an infinite periodic system , we have @xmath54 and thus obtain ( [ 1d - force - periodic ] ) . for any generic subsystem @xmath45 , on the other hand , the last term on the right in ( [ 1d - force - subsystem ] ) is the same for all particles in the subsystem . defining @xmath55 we thus obtain the equation of motion for any particle in the subsystem , relative to the cm of the subsystem , as @xmath56 where the sum extends over the particles in the subsystem .",
    "this remains valid for as long as no other particle outside the system crosses the particles at its extremities .",

    "\\label{1deom - finite - phys - coords}\\ ] ] these coordinates have been chosen in order to remove the damping term in the equations of motion , and all dependence on the expansion now appears only in a time dependent force term , of which the amplitude decays as @xmath60 . at sufficiently long times , therefore , an isolated subsystem of the infinite 1d  expanding \" model has , to an arbitarily good approximation , the equations of motion of a strictly isolated non - expanding 1d self - gravitating system .",
    "we will refer to the coordinates in ( [ physical coordinates ] ) as _ quasi - physical coordinates _ : they are the closest analogy we have to what are called physical coordinates in the three dimensional problem ( i.e. @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) . in these",
    "coordinates the 3d cosmological equations of motion are equivalent to those for an infinite newtonian self - gravitating system expanding about a centre in an infinite ( static ) space .",
    "correspondingly , any subsystem ( e.g. galaxy ) taken far from other mass in an expanding universe will evolve in these coordinates like an isolated newtonian system ( see e.g. @xcite for a derivation ) .",
    "the additional term in @xmath60 in the 1d model , which we can not get rid of by a coordinate transformation , appears because we have imposed in the derivation of the model the 3d expansion law rather than using the analogy of this law in 1d ( which gives a collapse in a finite time , qualitatively different to that of the 3d expansion which we wish to model ) . it is important to note that , re - expressed in terms of the three dimensional scale factor @xmath14 , the transformation in ( [ physical coordinates ] ) from the `` comoving '' coordinates @xmath63 to the `` quasi - physical '' coordinates in ( [ physical coordinates ] ) is @xmath64 , and _ not _ @xmath65 as one might naively expect . as a result",
    "they arrive at the incorrect conclusion from their numerical study that stable clustering is not observed in the model . ] .      the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 1deom - finite - finale ] ) may be rewritten simply as @xmath66 g n_0 y_i$ ] the first term is of order @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the average comoving density of the subsystem .",
    "thus if we consider any isolated subsystem which is already highly non - linear ( with @xmath69 ) we are necessarily in the regime where the second term may be neglected . in this case",
    "the isolated subsystem will thus behave , in quasi - physical coordinates , like a truly isolated 1d self - gravitating system . just as in 3d , such a system , for large @xmath4 , in the collisionless limit , attains on a few dynamical time scales ( @xmath70 ) a stationary virialized state ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , i.e. , a system which becomes time independent in the quasi - physical coordinates @xmath71 .",
    "more generally , even if not strictly virialized , it rapidly attains a well defined average size about which virial oscillations persist .      in order to derive the exponent in what follows we will also use the self - similar behaviour of the evolution , which , for the two point correlation function @xmath72 means that @xmath73 in the spatial range where",

    "further , since for @xmath95 , @xmath85 mesures simply the average density at distance @xmath83 from an occupied point normalized to the mean density , we have that @xmath96 .",

    "clearly , however , we do not expect in this case that the formation of non - linear structure at a given scale will leave approximately unperturbed the structures formed previously at smaller scales .",
    "the numerical study in @xcite , as most previous studies of the three models belonging to the class we are considering , exploits fully the very attractive property of these models that they admit  exact \" numerical integration : the force on particles , whether given in the form ( [ 1d - exact - force - disp ] ) or ( [ 1d - force - periodic ] ) , is such that the motion ( with or without damping ) admits an analytical solution other than at particle crossings .",
    "an event driven algorithm can then be employed , in which the determination of the time of the next  collision \" , and which pair of particles it involves , requires only the solution of algebraic equations .",
    "as described by @xcite the integration can be sped up optimally using a  heap \" structure .    for the previously considered cases ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath103 , the algebraic equations involved are , respectively , quadratic , quintic and cubic . for a generic @xmath2 ,",
    "however , the equations are not polynomial , and the numerical cost of solving them increases and makes the code , which is already expensive numerically , even more time consuming where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 and @xmath107 are constants . ] .",
    "as we wish to study fully a broad range of @xmath2 and initial conditions , we have chosen here instead to use a particle - mesh ( pm ) code of which the numerical speed can be greatly enhanced by the use of fft techniques and parallelization . in order to be sure that we are not , as a result , losing the advantages of the precision of the integration accessible in these 1d models , we calibrate , as discussed below , our choice of the new discreteness parameters introduced by the pm code by comparing our results with those obtained , for @xmath103 , using the  exact \" code .",
    "our pm code defines a regular grid on the simulation box , on which a density field @xmath75 is defined at each time step by a ",

    "an inverse fft then determines the force on the grid , which is then interpolated back onto the particle positions .",
    "the latter are then advanced using a leapfrog algorithm , with a simple adaptative timestep : it is chosen at each time by imposing that the mean distance travelled by particles during a time step be equal to a chosen fraction @xmath109 of the pm grid .",
    "compared to the exact code , our pm code therefore introduces resolution effects controlled by two dimensionless parameters : the size of the pm grid compared to the lattice spacing in the initial conditions , which we denote by @xmath110 , and the parameter @xmath109 controlling the size of the time steps .",
    "we have made an extensive study of the effects introduced by this finite resolution of the pm code , and in particular on the determination of the two point correlation function which is the quantity which interests us here .",

    "we have chosen our numerical parameters in the simulations reported below in order to obtain such an indiscernible difference in the correlation function between our code and the exact code , for the cases @xmath103 .",

    "we thus consider ( as in @xcite ) the cases @xmath119 .",
    "point processes with such power spectra are easy to set up : @xmath120 is obtained by randomly distributing points in the interval ( giving a power spectrum @xmath121 ) , the case @xmath111 by applying small random and uncorrelated displacements to a regular lattice , and @xmath122 in the same way but with the additional constraint that neighbouring pairs have equal and opposite displacements ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the fitted exponent associated with the ( by eye ) estimation of the end - points for the fit is very small ( of order a few percent at most ) in most parts of the parameter space .",

    "our results show excellent agreement with the stable clustering prediction for a very large part of the explored parameter space of initial conditions and cosmology .",
    "this region can be well characterized simply by the condition @xmath126 , i.e. , good agreement with stable clustering is observed simply in the region where the predicted exponent be larger than some critical value . in the rest of the parameter space ( i.e. for @xmath127 )",

    "it is precisely in this part of the parameter space , however , that there is also a considerable scatter about the curves of the measured exponents .",
    "this scatter is in fact just a measure of the uncertainty in the determination of these exponents , which is most difficult ( for reasons we explain in detail below ) in the region where the exponents become small .",
    "thus , our results are quite consistent with the hypothesis that the exponent in the region @xmath127 is  universal \" , in the sense that it is independent of initial conditions and cosmology . a schematic representation of this result is shown in fig .",

    "more precisely it appears that the criterion for it to work is that @xmath132 , which is a monotonically increasing function of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 , be larger than some critical value .",

    "let us consider two overdense regions , initially ( in the linear regime ) of comoving size @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",

    "( [ scaling ] ) can be written @xmath148 i.e. , the dependence on @xmath3 is in fact completely determined through the exponent @xmath132 itself .    the predicted stable clustering exponent is therefore directly related to a physical quantity which we would expect naturally to control the validity of the assumption made in deriving it : the more  concentrated \" are the pre - existing virialized substructures inside a larger structure when it collapses , the better should become the approximation that this structure will behave simply as a collection of sub - structures which are not disrupted by the virialization and subsequent evolution of the larger structure . indeed , in the limit that @xmath132 approaches unity , any structure which collapses and virializes will see the substructures it contains essentially as point particles . as @xmath132 decreases , on the other hand , we expect that the interaction between structures can lead to their disruption , and in particular that  mergers \" of substructures become much more probable .",
    "given that the value of the exponent @xmath132 characterizes precisely the relative  condensation \" of scales , it is very natural that a critical value of the exponent should characterize the breakdown of stable clustering .",
    "what our results do not allow us to conclude , as we have discussed , is what precisely happens in the regime where stable clustering breaks down : our numerical results do not allow us to clearly distinguish between the possibility of an abrupt ( discontinuous ) transition to a region in which there is a truly universal exponent , or a smoother transition to a region in which the exponent depends only very weakly on the relevant parameters ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "further we do not ( currently ) have a model to explain the exponent ( or narrow range of exponents ) observed in this part of the parameter space .    extending the analysis given just above to determine the scalings of relative sizes of structures , it is simple to understand why it is precisely the region of small @xmath132 in which the numerical results for the exponent of the power law in the correlation function are most noisy .",
    "the degree of precision in the measured exponent is essentially just a function of the range of scale over which the power - law behaviour extends , i.e. , it depends on the ratio @xmath150 accessible in a numerical simulation .",
    "the scale @xmath87 corresponds approximately at any time to the size of the largest ( approximately ) virialized scale .",
    "let use denote by @xmath6 the comoving size of the _ first _ structure which virializes in the simulation , at the time @xmath151 at which it virializes .",
    "self - similarity and stable clustering then imply the temporal evolutions @xmath152 we can infer , using eq .",
    "( [ time - delay ] ) , that , the range over which power law scaling is expected for @xmath153 at the end of the simulation can be expressed as @xmath154 where @xmath155 and @xmath156 are , respectively , the initial comoving size of the first and last scale to virialize during the evolution , and @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) are the number of particles they contain , respectively .",
    "thus , while for @xmath132 closer to unity this range of scales is large , as @xmath132 decreases it contracts and is simply of order the ratio @xmath159 for @xmath160 .    for our simulations , with @xmath112 particles , taking @xmath161 , or a little larger , and @xmath162 , we can , for small @xmath132 , access power law clustering over approximately two orders of magnitude , which leads in practice to the observed order of the uncertainly in the exponent ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "let us compare our results to those in three dimensions .",
    "numerical simulations have been done by various groups to test the stable clustering hypothesis , via the study of the eds model starting from power - law initial conditions ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . in this case , corresponding to @xmath80 in our notation , the predicted exponent , in three dimensions , of the two point correlation function is @xmath164 .",
    "the range of power spectra which has been probed numerically is @xmath165 .",
    "further , more generally , the stable clustering hypothesis leads to scaling relations for higher order correlation functions , which have been tested by some authors @xcite .    until the most recent and extensive study of @xcite , previous works had concluded that the stable clustering prediction worked quite well , with , in some cases , indications of small deviations close to the limits of numerical resolution .",
    "this last study , on the other hand , reports measurements of the exponent @xmath0 which are clearly discrepant with the stable clustering prediction : for @xmath166 , @xmath167 rather than @xmath168 ; for @xmath169 , @xmath170 rather than @xmath171 ; for @xmath172 , @xmath173 rather than @xmath174 ; for @xmath120 , @xmath175 rather than @xmath176 .",
    "these results are clearly _ qualitatively _ different from those we have found in our 1d models , for any @xmath2 . while the measured @xmath0 increases as @xmath1 increases , just as in one dimension , the discrepancy with stable clustering in three dimensions is associated with an exponent @xmath0 which is _ smaller _ than the predicted stable clustering exponent .",
    "further there is no indication  in this limited range of @xmath1 probed  that the discrepancy with respect to stable clustering is increasing , nor that the associated discrepancy manifests itself as an ( exact or approximate ) universality of the measured exponent .",
    "these differences between 1d and 3d results could , of course , be simply a reflection of the difference of the gravitational clustering in the two cases .",
    "one difference which may be essential , as discussed in @xcite , is that in one dimension there are no tidal forces , and a virialized structure may only be perturbed by another structure actually crossing it ( which is , on the other hand , much more likely than in three dimensions ) .",
    "however , one of the main motivations for this study is precisely that the reliability of results from 3d simulations is not clear : the combination of the fact that the range of comoving scales probed grows in proportion to @xmath177 , and the necessity to introduce a ( relatively large ) smoothing parameter to regularize the small scale divergence in the 3d gravitational force , mean that the exponents ( in existing studies ) are measured over at most a little more than one order of magnitude . further there are consideable discrepancies between some of the studies .",
    "@xcite find , for example , good agreement with stable clustering for the case @xmath166 with simulations of a similar size to those of @xcite .",
    "let us focus a little more on these differences between 1d and 3d simulations linked to the small scale smoothing of the force .",
    "in 1d , as discussed , the equations of motion can be integrated exactly in absence of smoothing , so that there is in practice _ no lower limit _ on spatial resolution other than that arising from the finite particle density , of order the scale @xmath86 in the correlation function .",
    "we note that , following the analysis above , we infer that , if stable clustering holds , we have @xmath178 in one dimension , while the same arguments applied to three dimensions give @xmath179 the scale @xmath180 , the comoving size of the first structure which virializes , is of order the initial interparticle spacing @xmath181 . in one dimension , even when we use , as here , a pm code , the smoothing can , without excessive numerical cost , be chosen so that it is at all times considerably smaller than the scale @xmath86 , so that we can be absolutely confident that it plays no role in the evolution . in three dimensions , on the contrary , cosmological simulations of a reasonable size ( i.e. , so that the range of scales @xmath159 which go non - linear cover at least a decade or two ) are typically performed with a smoothing of between one tenth and one hundredth of the interparticle spacing @xmath181 . thus 3d simulations can not in practice simulate systems manifesting stable clustering only over a very limited range of length scales , while remaining in the regime where @xmath182 . while the use of a cut - off @xmath183 does not necessarily imply that the clustering above the scale @xmath184 is not accurately reproduced , it is quite possible that this could be the case if great care is not taken in the choice of numerical parameters ( see @xcite ) . in this respect",
    "even when a relatively large smoothing is employed , two body relaxation may play a role in disrupting the desired collisionless evolution of @xmath4-body simulations , and such effects can potentially lead to a  pollution \" of larger scales than @xmath184 @xcite . in the 1d system , in contrast , there is in fact no two body collisionality analagous to that in three dimensions , and collisional relaxation ( of which the mechanism is not yet fully understood ) is extremely slow compared to that induced by 3d two body relaxation(see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "simple estimates show that such relaxation should play absolutely no role in our 1d simulations , while the same is not true in typical 3d simulations .",
    "our study thus suggests that particular attention should be paid to this point in the analysis of 3d simulations .",
    "we note also that simulations of clustering in a 3d universe have been performed for the case of a static universe , for the cases @xmath120 @xcite and @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "the results are in this case qualitatively very consistent with those observed here and in @xcite for the static ( @xmath185 ) limit . just as in the 1d simulations self - similarity is observed , and further a correlation function which appears to be the independent of the initial conditions , with a very shallow exponent in the inner part , @xmath186 .",
    "finally let us discuss the question of  universality \" .",
    "a striking feature of our 1d results is that the measured exponent characterising clustering appears to become independent of initial conditions and cosmology when the stable clustering approximation breaks down  more specifically when the exponent @xmath1 in the initial power spectrum is sufficiently small for any given expansion rate parameter @xmath2 . in three dimensions , following notably the work of @xcite ,",
    "much emphasis has been placed on a  universality \" of cosmological gravitational clustering which manifests itself as an apparent independence of halo profiles of initial conditions and cosmology .",
    "the range over which such a universality might apply is not , however , clear : studies such as that of @xcite show that , even in the eds cosmology , the inner exponent of halos may vary sensibly for power law initial conditions as a function of @xmath1 .    does the apparent universality we observe in 1d correspond to a universality in halo profiles ? as discussed in @xcite , one can identify and extract halos by prescriptions analogous to those used in three dimensions .",
    "however , the objects thus extracted are simply so  clumpy \" , at any scale significantly above the scale @xmath86 , that it is not possible to approximate the run of density by a smooth profile : indeed it can be verified directly that the power law exponent ( over several decades ) in the correlation function corresponds to a truly scale invariant fractal distribution of the matter in the corresponding range .",
    "if , however , the extracted halos are smoothed ( by hand ) over a scale much larger than @xmath86 , the exponent characterising the decay of density about the centre of the halo , should be approximately the same as that measured in the correlation function .",
    "this is true because the latter measures , by definition , the mean density as a function of distance about any point , which in a simple fractal type distribution is ( modulo fluctuations ) the same about any point .",
    "thus , in the 1d model , the universality we observe here is indeed expected to be associated to a universality of inner exponents of halos .    extrapolated to 3d , our results thus suggest that the relative smoothness of halo profiles is an artefact of insufficient spatial resolution , and that the minimal scale of substructure is limited only by such resolution . in this case , for power law initial conditions , the observed power law slope of the correlation function should in fact _ coincide _ with the inner exponent of the measured halo profiles .",
    "we note that this is completely different to what is predicted usually in three dimensions on the basis of a smooth halo model ( see e.g. @xcite ) . up to now 3d numerical studies have not , to our knowledge , addressed this point directly ( by comparing measured slopes in halos and two point correlation functions , in scale free cosmologies ) .",
    "we note that the results of @xcite on inner halo profiles appear , however , to be very consistent with a behaviour completely analogous to what we have seen in our 1d models : in their study of power law initial conditions in an eds cosmology , for @xmath1 varying in a range between @xmath187 and @xmath188 , inner slopes for halo profiles are estimated using different fitting procedures . for the simplest such procedure it is found ( see fig .",
    "2 ) that the measured exponent varies from a value in good agreement with stable clustering for the largest value of @xmath1 , but appears to deviate , as @xmath1 decreases , towards an exponent which is _ larger _ than predicted by stable clustering , tending rapidly towards an asymptotic exponent a little larger than unity , and consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "this suggests that in the 3d eds model , the universality of halos would translate to an insensitivity to initial conditions below an @xmath1 of order @xmath189 .",
    "given that the range of effective exponents of initial conditions of typical cosmological ( e.g. @xmath25cdm ) initial conditions falls in or close to this range , this would appear to be very consistent with the approximate universality of halo profile exponents observed in these kind of simulations .",
    "our 1d study thus motivates further careful numerical study of non - linear clustering in the pure matter ( @xmath80 ) eds model in three dimensions , extending recent studies such as @xcite and @xcite . in the same way",
    "as has been done here , the study of this model can be extended to the full family of eds models of which one limit is a static universe .",
    "the goal of such a study would be to see if , in this space of models , and for power law initial conditions , a similar structure is found to that we have seen in one dimension .",
    "our 1d study suggests that particular attention needs to be applied to controlling for the robustness of measure of exponents in the two point correlation function to small scale force smoothing , particularly when an exponent below the predicted stable clustering value is found ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "further , study of the relation between exponents measured from the two point correlation function and those measured from halos , and their variation as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , should clarify whether the qualitative nature of clustering is indeed like that usually assumed in theoretical modelling ( smooth halo models ) or instead like that in the 1d models ( hierarchical fractal clustering ) .",
    "if the framework suggested by the 1d models  of a  universal \" region in the space of initial conditions of clustering , delimited by a  critical \" value of the predicted stable clustering exponent  is correct , and applies also in three dimensions , the theoretical problem remains of understanding both the corresponding value of the  universal exponent \" , and why this universality applies in the specific region where it does .",
    "further study of the 1d model may then help to throw further light on this . as the static model is in the relevant part of the parameter space",
    ", it may suffice to study this particular limit , i.e. , the region in which there is universality is where the expansion of the universe has little effect on the non - linear clustering .",
    "we note that a very recent study in @xcite shows that there is an apparent universality in the properties of the  halos \" formed from the 1d collapse of a single structure with a range of cold initial conditions , and argues that this universality may be related to that observed numerically in three dimensions . the 1d halos in @xcite , however , are smooth , very different to the non - linear structures we observe here , which are very clumpy even in the static limit of the 1d model .",
    "as discussed above , however , in this limit the range of non - linear clustering explored by our simulations is still quite modest , and it may be that larger simulations might establish a link to the study of @xcite .    with respect to this last point ",
    "the effect of varying particle number  we note that we have not discussed here the question of whether the dynamics of these simulations in the non - linear regime is representative of the fluid or vlasov poisson limit . in three dimensions",
    "this is a crucial question which has been the subject of discussion and some controversy @xcite , and one might expect that these 1d models , with their large accessible spatial resolution , could help to throw light on this question . in n body simulations this question can in principle be directly probed by comparing simulations in which the particle number n is varied while keeping the lower cut - off scale to the initial density fluctuations fixed , or , alternatively , by increasing particle density in units of the grid of our pm code .",
    "further , in contrast to three dimensions , it should be feasible to address this question much more directly by comparison of the results of the integration of the n body system with a direct numerical integration of the vlasov - poisson equations themselves .",
    "this is another interesting future direction for work on these models .",
