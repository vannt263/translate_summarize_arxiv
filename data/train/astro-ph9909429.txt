    "that only a very small fraction of the mass in molecular clouds is ultimately converted into stars is well established by observations ( e.g. , zuckerman & palmer 1974 ; carpenter et al .",
    "1993 ; fuller 1994 ) .",
    "mouschovias ( 1976 , 1977 , 1978 ) proposed that the observed inefficiency in star formation is naturally explained by molecular clouds being supported against gravitational collapse by interstellar magnetic fields .",
    "collapse in the interior flux tubes of a cloud is initiated by ambipolar diffusion , the gravitationally - induced drift of neutral gas with respect to plasma and magnetic field .",
    "extensive discussion of various aspects of star formation in magnetic clouds , including the role of ambipolar diffusion , can be found in the reviews by mouschovias ( 1987 ) , shu , adams , & lizano ( 1987 ) , mckee et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and mouschovias & ciolek ( 1999 ) .",
    "early axisymmetric calculations considered the initial quasistatic evolution driven by ambipolar diffusion ( mouschovias 1979 ; nakano 1979 ; lizano & shu 1989 ) .",
    "fiedler & mouschovias ( 1992 , 1993 ) presented detailed numerical simulations showing the formation and subsequent collapse of supercritical cores in two - dimensional , axisymmetric , isothermal , self - gravitating , magnetic model molecular clouds .",
    "the flattening of the cloud along the magnetic field lines in these models was used in companion studies by ciolek & mouschovias ( 1993 , 1994 ; hereafter cm93 and cm94 , respectively ) , who modeled the formation of cores by ambipolar diffusion in disk - like magnetic clouds , including the effects of charged and neutral dust grains in their calculation .",
    "disk - like model clouds were also used by basu & mouschovias ( 1994 , 1995a , b ; hereafter bm94 , bm95a , bm95b ) , who studied the roles of rotation and magnetic braking in the evolution of cores .",
    "the effect of an external ultraviolet radiation field , which ionizes the outer regions of a cloud , was incorporated into these models by ciolek & mouschovias ( 1995 ; hereafter cm95 ) .",
    "qualitatively , the results of these calculations were quite alike : supercritical cores formed due to ambipolar diffusion and went on to collapse dynamically while embedded in magnetically supported ( subcritical ) clouds . these studies , as well as other magnetic models without ambipolar diffusion ( e.g. , tomisaka 1996 ; li & shu 1996 ; nakamura et al .",
    "1999 ) , show that collapsing supercritical regions should have an oblate shape .",
    "past comparison of observed cores with ambipolar diffusion models has yielded positive results . a model for the barnard 1 cloud was presented by crutcher et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ; core properties predicted by their model ( such as the mass , mean density , and magnetic field strength ) were found to be in excellent agreement with observed values ( in some instances , differing by less than 10% ) .",
    "in addition , sub - mm continuum observations of prestellar cores ( ward - thompson et al . 1994 ; andr , ward - thompson , & motte 1996 ) , yield density profiles that are in reasonable agreement with those developed in the ambipolar diffusion models .",
    "benson , caselli , & myers ( 1998 ) measured the velocity difference between @xmath0 and neutral molecules ( @xmath1 and ccs ) in sixty dense cores ; they noted that their upper limit on the ion - neutral drift speed ( @xmath2 ) is consistent with our published models of core formation and contraction due to ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the l1544 cloud , located in taurus , seems to be a particularly well - suited candidate for comparison with theoretical models .",
    "ward - thompson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) suggested that the l1544 core could be a transitional object between a starless core and a core with an iras source .",
    "as such , the evolutionary state of l1544 could correspond to a recently formed supercritical core which is entering the stage of rapid infall , according to the magnetic models described above .",
    "recent observations by tafalla et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter referred to as t98 ) indicate that l1544 does show infall on scales of 0.1 pc .",
    "more recently , williams et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter referred to as w99 ) have presented a high - resolution interferometric study of the l1544 core , which allows them to map the kinematics of the ionized species @xmath3 down to radii @xmath4 0.02 pc . in both papers ,",
    "significant infall motions are detected and used to call into question the applicability of the ambipolar diffusion models presented by , e.g. , cm95 and bm94 .",
    "a further point in favor of relatively rapid infall motions is the relative statistics of cores with and without embedded protostars , implying a starless core lifetime of @xmath4 1 myr ( e.g. , lee & myers 1999 ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate whether ambipolar diffusion models are relevant in explaining the formation and evolution of the l1544 core . in ",
    "2 we reexamine the results of the earlier ambipolar diffusion models in light of the new observational surveys .",
    "we find that , in reality , many of the results of the earlier models are consistent with the infall deduced from observations , if the infall region is taken to represent a portion of the supercritical core . in ",
    "3 we present a new ambipolar diffusion model specifically designed to simulate the evolution of the l1544 core .",
    "this particular model uses as input data quantities well within the observationally allowed region of physical parameters .",
    "our results are summarized in   4 .",
    "a key result of axisymmetric numerical simulations of magnetically regulated star formation ( fiedler & mouschovias 1993 ; cm94 , cm95 ; bm94 , bm95a , bm95b ) is the formation of an inner region with supercritical mass - to - flux ratio .",
    "a supercritical region can only form when the central column density ( indirectly , the density as well ) exceeds a critical value effectively determined by the background magnetic field strength . a supercritical region with size proportional to the thermal critical length scale ( see   3 ) at the critical column density begins rapid collapse and effectively separates from its subcritical surroundings . scaling laws for the sizes and masses of such cores",
    "are given by bm95b .",
    "the cores are characterized by power - law profiles in density , magnetic field components , and angular velocity .",
    "the innermost regions have density profiles approaching @xmath5 , but the outer regions ( where most of the mass is contained ) have progressively shallower slope , so that if we write @xmath6 , the mass - weighted mean @xmath7 falls between @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the various models ( cm94 , cm95 ; bm94 , bm95a , bm95b ) .",
    "the shallowness of the outer profile is due to increasing magnetic support ( alternatively , decreasing mass - to - flux ratio ) in the outer core .",
    "the cores are flattened due to the remaining significant magnetic support , with typical axial ratios in the range @xmath10 .",
    "an individual observed core is best compared with theory while keeping the whole ensemble of models in mind ( e.g. , see the parameter study done by bm95a , bm95b ) , rather than comparing with a single standard model .",
    "this is due to the considerable observational uncertainty in input parameters such as the background magnetic field strength and ionization fraction , as well as real variations allowed by nature .",
    "below , we interpret the l1544 observations in terms of an overall understanding gained from the parameter studies .",
    "a point of general agreement of the models with observations is the conclusion of t98 that the overall density profile in l1544 is shallower than @xmath5 .",
    "they find an approximate fit with an @xmath11 profile over a scale of 0.1 pc .",
    "several simplifying assumptions are used to obtain this estimate ( see t98 ) , and error bounds are not explicitly estimated , although @xmath12 and @xmath5 profiles are ruled out .",
    "we point out that an approximate @xmath11 density profile in a prestellar core is inconsistent with a scale - free isothermal ball of gas , but _ is _ in reasonable agreement with the magnetic models discussed above .",
    "an apparent disagreement with the magnetic models as stated by t98 and w99 is the evidence for extensive inward motions , of order 0.1 km s@xmath13 , from scales of 0.1 pc ( t98 ) down to 0.02 pc ( w99 ) .",
    "the claim that these motions exceed that of the magnetic models over similar ranges in length and density is based on a comparison with the standard models of the above studies .",
    "we first compare the w99 results with the existing models , since infall motions on the small scales @xmath4 0.02 pc are more easily produced in these models .",
    "the essence of w99 s claim is that at radius @xmath14 0.02 pc , where the inferred density is @xmath15 @xmath16 , the inferred infall motions for the ionic species @xmath3 , @xmath17 , greatly exceed those of ambipolar diffusion models .",
    "we refer the reader to w99 for an exposition of the significant uncertainties in obtaining these numbers . for the remainder of this paper ,",
    "we take these numbers at face value . when we examine the standard model 2 of bm94 and the standard @xmath18 model of cm95 ( scaling the results to the estimated kinetic temperature 12 k )",
    ", we find that the infall is indeed slower than these numbers when the _ central _ density is close to @xmath19 @xmath16 , i.e. , bm94 s model 2 has ionic infall velocity @xmath20 km s@xmath13 and cm95 has @xmath21 km s@xmath13 .",
    "however , the observations , which have spatial resolution @xmath14 0.01 pc , can not determine the central density .",
    "therefore , it is prudent to compare the evolutionary models at all possible times when the density at radius @xmath22 pc is in approximate agreement with the estimated density @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "it is striking that the development of a power - law density profile in the magnetic models yields an asymptotic value of the density at this radius that is very close to the observed one . at later times , when supercritical collapse is well developed , the density at @xmath23 pc is @xmath24 @xmath16 and @xmath25 @xmath16 in the bm94 and cm95 models , respectively . at the same radius ,",
    "the asymptotic values of @xmath26 are @xmath27 km s@xmath13 and @xmath28 km s@xmath13 in the same two models . since the likely inclination angle @xmath29 for the disk is @xmath30 ( see   3 ) , the @xmath31 factor due to the inclination of the disk can reduce the maximum line of sight velocity by a factor of only @xmath32 .",
    "hence , we conclude that the infall observations of w99 are _ not _ in disagreement with the standard magnetic collapse models if the cores are in a later stage of development , with an unresolved central density @xmath33 @xmath16 .",
    "such models are typically characterized by background magnetic field strengths of @xmath34 and ionization fraction @xmath35 at a neutral density @xmath36 @xmath16 . indeed , w99 themselves comment",
    "that their results may be in agreement with the rapid infall observed in the model of li ( 1998 ) if late time collapse is considered .",
    "we are in agreement with this statement since the model of li ( 1998 ) , while restricted to an unnatural spherical geometry in the presence of magnetic fields , and lacking the quantitatively important magnetic tension force , reproduces qualitatively the broad features of infall found in the more detailed models described above .",
    "the evidence for a later stage of evolution is strengthened by the millimeter dust continuum measurements of ward - thompson , motte , & andr ( 1999 ) , whose high - resolution observations establish a flattening of the column density profile of l1544 on inner scales of @xmath37 au , with a central column density @xmath38 @xmath39 .",
    "this central column density places the evolutionary state of the core between the times @xmath40 and @xmath41 in most of our models ( see   3 ) , corresponding to a central density in the range @xmath42 .    on larger scales of @xmath43 pc ,",
    "t98 detect infall motions with maximum values @xmath14 0.1 km s@xmath13 .",
    "these motions _ are _ somewhat greater than the infall speeds presented in the standard models mentioned above . at a radius @xmath44 pc , the standard model 2 of bm94 and the @xmath18 model of cm95 yield neutral infall speeds of @xmath45 km s@xmath13 and @xmath46 km s@xmath13 , respectively ( again , for @xmath47 k ) .",
    "the parameter study of bm95a and bm95b reveals two general means by which this factor @xmath48 ( or slightly higher due to disk inclination ) discrepancy can be resolved : ( 1 ) a lower background magnetic field strength , yielding a lower critical density for collapse and consequently a larger supercritical core ( see bm95b , models 5 and 6 ) .",
    "( 2 ) a lower ionization fraction , yielding relatively more rapid infall at all times ( see bm95a , models 8 and 9 ) .",
    "both magnetic field strengths and ionization fractions are characterized by appreciable observational uncertainty . in this paper , we concentrate primarily on the first possibility ; a lower background magnetic field strength .",
    "model 6 of bm95b can be interpreted as having a @xmath49 of about @xmath50 .",
    "the central flux tube initially has a critical mass - to - flux ratio , although the rest of the cloud is initially subcritical . results of this model , presented in bm95b ( see their fig .",
    "6 ) shows an extended infall zone due to the low density at which a supercritical core is formed . using @xmath51",
    "k yields neutral and ionic infall velocities @xmath52 km s@xmath13 and @xmath53 km s@xmath13 at @xmath54 pc .",
    "significant infall is actually present at even larger radii in this model .",
    "our point in reviewing these models is not that any single one fits the observations of l1544 exactly , but that the observed features are broadly consistent with features found in one or many previously published models which use reasonable input parameters .",
    "therefore , the l1544 core can very likely be modeled as a supercritical core undergoing magnetically diluted collapse . in the following section",
    ", we present a new model which can simultaneously match as many features of the l1544 core as possible .",
    "we now turn to a model designed to more accurately simulate inferred quantities for the l1544 core .",
    "dimensionless parameters used as initial input for this model are : a central mass - to - flux ratio ( in units of the critical value for collapse ) @xmath55 , and a reference state column density lengthscale @xmath56 .",
    "( the definition and meaning of these and the other free parameters specifying our disk models are discussed in cm93 , cm94 , cm95 , and bm94 , bm95a , b. ) since there have been no significant azimuthal velocities detected in l1544 , we neglect for now the effect of rotation and magnetic braking .",
    "we do account for the effect of an external ultraviolet radiation field acting on the cloud ; the dimensionless parameters @xmath57 ( @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the uv ionization rate of neutral atomic species @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the cosmic - ray ionization rate ) , which fix the uv ionization rates at the cloud boundary , are the same as those listed for models @xmath62 and @xmath18 in table 1 of cm95 , except that they are to be multiplied by a factor = ( 5/1.3)= 3.8 , reflecting our use of a cosmic - ray ionization rate @xmath63 instead of the @xmath64 used by cm95 . as in our previous models ,",
    "the dimensionless cloud radius @xmath65 is taken to be @xmath66 .",
    "we select a value of @xmath65 such that a mass @xmath67 is contained within the dimensional radius @xmath68 , as estimated for the l1544 cloud by t98 ( see their fig .",
    "the mass contained at radii @xmath69 pc , which is required in our models solely for computational purposes  the gravitational field diverges if we abruptly cut off the mass distribution at this radius ( see the associated discussion on this point in   4.1 of crutcher et al . 1994 )  has little effect on the dynamics of the core in our model cloud , and remains essentially fixed in space because of effective magnetic support at large radii ( see figs .",
    "@xmath70-@xmath71 ) .",
    "finally , the collisional effects of grains have been made negligible by assuming relatively large grains , with radius @xmath72 cm .",
    "the larger cross - section of these grains is more than offset by their low abundance relative to the ions ( cm93 , ciolek & mouschovias 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "the grains , however , still play a crucial role in the evolution of our model , in that recombination of ions and electrons takes place on their surfaces , which affects the chemical reaction rates and the calculation of the abundances of charged particles throughout the cloud ( cm94 , ciolek & mouschovias 1998 ) .",
    "physically , the parameters cited above could represent an isothermal cloud with temperature @xmath73 = 12 k , initial central density and magnetic field strength ( in the equatorial plane of the cloud ) @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively . because the cloud is only 20% subcritical ,",

    "note that the core radius is greater than the scale of the observations made by both w99 (= 0.02 pc ) and t98 ( @xmath97 pc ) , hence , as discussed in   2 , we identify the region studied in these dedicated studies as existing _ within _ the supercritical core .",

    "the detectable lifetime of the collapsing core in our l1544 model ( @xmath182 ) is comparable to that inferred from statistics of an ensemble of cores ( lee & myers 1999 ) .",
    "while our model supercritical core is to be compared with the infall zone of the l1544 core , of radial extent @xmath43 pc , our cloud model also yields numbers for the subcritical envelope .",
    "however , we have not presented these as predictions for the envelope structure . as discussed in our earlier papers ,",
    "the outer density structure is strongly dependent on adopted initial conditions .",
    "for example , a sharp break in the density profile , with power - law index @xmath102 dropping significantly lower than @xmath183 just outside the supercritical core , is a feature of models with highly subcritical envelopes ( e.g. , model 7 of bm95b , and model @xmath18 of cm95 ) .",
    "further modeling of the envelope structure can be guided by new data for the outer regions ( e.g. , see preliminary data in andr et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "hopefully , our new study will stimulate greater interaction between observation and theory , in which observations can more tightly constrain input parameters for theoretical models , and the models can make new predictions for unobserved quantities .",
    "although the occurrence of processes not included in our model can not be ruled out , our results suggest that current observations of infall in starless cores are compatible with the evolution of cores with supercritical mass - to - flux ratio that have formed through ambipolar diffusion .",
