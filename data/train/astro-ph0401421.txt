    "the baryonic content of the galaxy clusters is dominated by the hot ( @xmath1 kev ) intergalactic gas whose thermal emission is observed in x - rays",
    ". many clusters also exhibit diffuse radio sources that have no apparent connection to any individual cluster galaxy . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the extremely low - brightness , large - scale sources classified as _",
    "radio halos_. they often span the whole cluster and are unpolarized .",
    "other diffuse radio sources , not considered here , include strongly elongated _ relics _ , which are highly polarized and often found at the cluster periphery , and _ mini - halos _ which are found around the powerful central radio galaxy ; for recent reviews see e.g. kempner et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , feretti ( 2003 ) .    while the cluster x - ray emission is due to thermal electrons with energies of several kev , the radio halo emission at @xmath2 ghz is produced by synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons with energies of @xmath3 gev in magnetic fields with @xmath4 g .",
    "these electrons should coexist with the thermal population .",
    "their origin is still uncertain ; the difficulty in explaining their presence arises from the combination of the large sizes of halos ( @xmath5 mpc ) and the short synchrotron lifetime of these electrons ( @xmath6 yrs ) .",
    "one needs a mechanism by which these electrons are locally and simultaneously ( re-)accelerated over the halo volume . several such mechanisms of feeding energy to the relativistic electrons have been proposed ( see , e.g. , recent reviews by enlin 1999 ; sarazin 2001 ; brunetti 2002 ; petrosian 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "we will briefly review theoretical arguments in  [ sec : disc ] .    on the observational side ,",
    "the number of known radio halos is already sufficient to start looking for correlations with other cluster properties in order to elucidate their acceleration mechanism .",
    "halos are typically found in clusters with significant substructure in the x - ray brightness which indicates merger activity ( e.g. , feretti 1999 ; buote 2001 ) .",
    "halos are present in rich clusters , characterized by high x - ray luminosities and temperatures .",
    "the percentage of clusters with halos in a complete x - ray flux - limited sample ( that includes systems with @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 in the @xmath9 kev band ) is @xmath10% .",
    "the halo fraction increases with the x - ray luminosity , to @xmath11% for clusters with @xmath12 erg s@xmath8 ( giovannini , feretti , & govoni 1999a ) .",
    "the radio power of a halo , if one is present , strongly correlates with the cluster luminosity , gas temperature ( e.g. , liang et al .",
    "2000 ; colafrancesco 1999 ; feretti 1999 ) , or total mass ( govoni et al .",
    "2001a ) . in a number of well - resolved clusters , a spatial correlation between the radio halo and x - ray brightness",
    "is observed ( govoni et al .",
    "these observations indicate that radio halos are closely related to the intra - cluster thermal gas , its history and energetics .",
    "however , details of this connection need further investigations .",
    "because the halos appear to be related to cluster mergers , cluster gas temperature maps , which contain information on the merger geometry , stage , and velocity , can provide further information on their origin .",
    "indeed ,  studies of a2163 , a665 ( markevitch & vikhlinin 2001 , hereafter mv01 ) , e  ( markevitch et al . 2002a , hereafter m02a ) and a520 ( markevitch et al .",
    "2002b , hereafter m02b ) revealed a possible spatial correlation between the high - temperature cluster regions and the diffuse radio emission .",
    "a665 showed a spatial correlation between the radio halo brightness and the location of a possible bow shock , appearing to support a merger shock origin for the relativistic halo electrons .",
    "clearly , an x - ray and radio study of a greater cluster sample is needed to see whether a spatial correlation between the radio halo and the gas temperature is a common feature .",

    "the relatively small radio halo in a2218 ( giovannini & feretti 2000 ) is slightly ( by about @xmath41 ) offset from the x - ray brightness peak and does not show a particularly strong correlation with the temperature map  in fact , the hottest spot in the cluster is not seen in the radio , as in a754 and a773 .",
    "the radio image has a relatively low sensitivity , however .",
    "optical analyses of the bright nearby cluster a2319 ( e.g. , faber & dressler 1977 , oegerle , hill , & fitchett 1995 , tr ` evese , cirimele , & de simone 2000 ) suggested that it consists of two components superimposed along the line of sight , with a subcluster around the second - brightest galaxy projected about @xmath42 northwest of the cd galaxy ( seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : a2319]_a _ ) . that subcluster is seen as a cool x - ray extension in the  image and the crude  temperature map ( markevitch 1996 ) .",
    "a2319 exhibits an extended and powerful radio halo ( harris & miley 1978 ) with an irregular morphology well correlated with the x - ray brightness ( feretti et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we use a  observation of a2319 to derive the first detailed temperature map of this cluster , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a2319 ] along with our x - ray image and a 1.4 ghz  image from feretti et al .",
    "the most prominent feature seen in the x - ray data is a sharp cold front southeast of the cd galaxy , such as those discovered by  in many other merging clusters ( e.g. , markevitch et al .",
    "2000a ; vikhlinin , markevitch & murray 2001 ) .",
    "the central cool gas cloud is clearly moving southeast with respect to the ambient hotter gas ( or , equivalently , the hotter gas is flowing around it to the northwest ) .",
    "the cd galaxy is neither at the centroid nor at the coolest spot of the cluster , suggesting that the cool gas core is moving independently of this galaxy .",
    "the cd galaxy appears to have its own gas density peak on a smaller linear scale , itself displaced eastward from the galaxy .",
    "( we note that this brightness peak falls exactly on the acis - i central low - exposure spot , so the apparent temperature dip there may be an artifact . )",
    "we can also see a cool arm extending around the cluster center from the tip of the cold front in the general direction of the northwestern subcluster .",
    "it may either be a tail of that subcluster , or gas stripped from the cold front cloud , unrelated to the subcluster .",
    "overall , the picture suggests a later stage of a merger , well past the initial encounter .",
    "the radio halo follows remarkably closely the distribution of the cool gas in the core , except for two low - brightness extensions into the hotter gas northeast and southwest of the cold front .",
    "the radio halo is more extended southwest of the x - ray brightness centroid  toward the cooler gas that we observe there .",
    "[ [ e ] ] e ~    e  is one of the hottest , most luminous clusters known ( tucker et al.1998 ) which also contains the most luminous radio halo ( liang et al .",
    "an early  observation revealed a spectacular bow shock propagating in front of a dense , cool bullet - like subcluster exiting the site of the collision with a bigger subcluster ( m02a ) .",
    "those authors derived an approximate temperature map of this merger and noticed that the radio halo brightness peaks at the hottest cluster region .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1e0657 - 56 ] , we compare the liang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) 1.3 ghz radio image with a new , more accurate temperature map obtained from a deeper  exposure by markevitch et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the new map and the x - ray image suggest that the smaller subcluster has arrived at the collision site from the southeast .",
    "most of its outer gas was shocked and stripped during the collision with a bigger subcluster ( whose largest galaxies are now seen in the east ) .",
    "this stripped gas , together with the shocked gas from the other subcluster , form the north - south bar - like structure seen in the x - ray image , which is probably a pancake in projection .",
    "shocks could not penetrate and stop the dense core of the subcluster , and it is now continuing to the west , preceded by a bow shock with @xmath43 .",
    "this subcluster should be generating vigorous turbulence in its wake .",
    "the radio halo peak is clearly offset from the x - ray brightness peak ( in the region that excludes the bullet ) , and instead is centered in the hottest cluster region .",
    "the halo s eastern part is elongated along the presumed infall trajectory of the subcluster .",
    "interestingly , the western part of the halo extends all the way to the bow shock .",
    "substructure in the x - ray images and the galaxy spatial and velocity distributions , as well as complex gas temperature structure , are signatures of cluster mergers .",
    "all these properties are common in clusters containing radio halos .",
    "on the other hand , we do not know of extended radio halos in relaxed clusters .",
    "therefore , the available data suggest that radio halos are related to mergers .    from the energetic grounds , mergers can indeed dissipate enough kinetic energy  simultaneously over a megaparsec - scale volume  for the maintenance of a radio halo .",
    "however , it is not clear how exactly the relativistic particles are accelerated .",
    "in - situ acceleration ( or re - acceleration ) of relativistic electrons during a merger can occur in shocks ( e.g. sarazin 1999 , fujita & sarazin 2001 ) or in the gas turbulence ( e.g. schlickeiser , sievers , & thiemann 1987 ; brunetti et al .",
    "2001 ; ohno , takizawa , & shibata s. 2002 , fujita , takizawa , & sarazin 2003 ) .",
    "there are theoretical arguments against the shock hypothesis .",
    "most importantly , a relatively strong shock with @xmath44 is believed to be necessary for generation of an observable halo ( e.g. , brunetti 2002 ) .",
    "such high mach numbers should be very rare , as most merger shocks should have @xmath45 at the cluster center .",
    "gabici & blasi ( 2003 ) argued that shocks expected in mergers of clusters with comparable masses are too weak to result in significant non - thermal emission ( the expected mach number increases with the mass ratio of the merging subclusters ) .",
    "moreover , according to miniati et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , such radio emission would look more like radio relics at the cluster periphery rather than as radio halos .",
    "however , physics of collisionless shocks in clusters is not well understood , and so at present even relatively weak merger shocks can not be completely ruled out as an acceleration mechanism .    indeed ,",
    "comparison of the radio halo and gas temperature maps for a few merging clusters ( mv01 , m02a , m02b ) hinted at their spatial correlation , which could be easily explained if electrons were accelerated in shocks .",
    "a currently propagating or just - passed merger shock would leave clear imprint in the cluster gas temperature maps in the form of hot regions . after the shock passage , regions of shock - heated gas quickly expand adiabatically and come into pressure equilibrium with the surroundings .",
    "large - scale gas motions during the merger subsequently mix gases of different temperature , resulting in patchy temperature structure ( as seen in simulations , e.g. , roettiger , stone , & burns ( 1999 ) , takizawa 2000 , ricker & sarazin 2001 ) which persists for a considerable time in the absence of thermal conduction ( markevitch et al .  2003a ) .",
    "any relativistic electrons accelerated as the shock passes through the gas , will be prevented from diffusing far from their origin by the magnetic fields ( the same fields that suppress thermal conduction and diffusion of thermal electrons , e.g. , vikhlinin et al .",
    "2001 ; markevitch et al .",
    "2003a ) , and will follow the bulk motion of their host gas .",
    "thus , if relativistic electrons are accelerated by merger shocks , and assuming a uniform magnetic field ( or , at least , a field uncorrelated with the gas temperature ) , one expects strong spatial correlation between the radio halo brightness and the hottest gas regions ( in the absence of strong projection effects , of course ) .    on the other hand , the gas turbulence ,",
    "although not directly observable at present , is expected to exist throughout the merging clusters , including shock - heated and cooler gas regions ( e.g. , sunyaev , norman & bryan 2003 ) .",
    "therefore in the turbulence scenario , there should be no strong correlation between the radio brightness and the temperature .",
    "the analysis presented here is a qualitative attempt to distinguish between the shock and turbulence acceleration mechanisms by means of a systematic comparison of radio halo maps with the temperature maps for a sample of halo clusters with good radio and x - ray data .",
    "all clusters studied here reveal clear signs of ongoing mergers and the accompanying strong spatial temperature variations .",
    "although in most of these clusters , the merger geometry is ambiguous and the likely projection effects complicate comparison with the radio data , we can draw several conclusions .",
    "we confirm the previously reported spatial coincidence of bright radio features with the high temperature regions in a665 , a2163 , and e , which was based on the shorter x - ray observations . e  and a520 are the best examples of this temperature - radio connection .",
    "this spatial `` coincidence '' is not quite a",
    " correlation  these clusters also exhibit bright radio emission from some of the cool gas regions , but in the presense of projection effects , exact correlation is not expected . as discussed by mv01 , the leading edge of the `` limb - brightened '' ( jones & saunders 1996 ) halo in a665 coincides with the apparent location of a possible relatively strong shock ahead of the fast - moving cool core .",
    "this observation appear to argue for the shock acceleration mechanism .    on the other hand , in a2319 , which is at a very similar merger stage to a665",
    ", we do not detect a particularly hot , shock - heated region in front of the moving cool core , so its mach number should be low . yet",
    ", the cluster exhibits a radio halo whose brightest part follows rather closely the distribution of the _ cooler _ gas in the core ( although at a lower brightness level , the halo s ne - sw extension appears to coincide with the outlying hotter regions ) .",
    "moreover , in a754 and a773 , the hottest cluster regions do not show radio emission , at least at the present sensitivity , while there is radio emission elsewhere in these clusters .",
    "the same appears true for the small halo in a2218 , although the sensitivity of the radio data here is poor .",
    "while radio emission from cooler areas can be explained by projection effects , given that the x - ray - derived projected temperature is biased toward the denser , cooler gas on the line of sight , projection can not explain the absence of the radio emission from the hottest cluster regions .",
    "we believe that this is a strong observational argument against merger shocks , at least the relatively weak ones expected in most mergers , as the main acceleration mechanism .",
    "this leaves turbulence as a more viable mechanism .",
    "indeed , all clusters in our sample where the merger geometry is tractable  e , a520 , a2319 , and a665  exhibit relatively small , dense , cool moving clouds which are likely to generate turbulence in their wake .",
    "the radio halos are observed along the path of these moving clouds . in a754 , the eastern",
    "halo lies along the bright cool x - ray tongue , which is likely to be the flow of dense gas possibly generating turbulence at its interface . in a773 ,",
    "the passage of the eastern mass peak through the gas of the main subcluster may also generate turbulence in the bright radio area .",
    "the remaining clusters have sufficiently uncertain merger geometries to be consistent with the possibility of strong turbulence in the right regions .    however , with turbulence alone , it is difficult to explain the observed extension of the radio halo in e  ahead of the gas bullet all the way to the bow shock , a similar extension into the shock region ahead of the core in a665 , and possibly in a520 .",
    "turbulence caused by these cores can not precede the fast - moving core , especially in such a high - velocity merger as e. thus , in systems like these , at least some of the relativistic electrons should be accelerated in shocks .",
    "incidentally , e  has a shock with the highest - known mach number ( @xmath43 , m02a ) and a665 appears to contain a relatively high-@xmath46 shock as well ( @xmath34 , mv01 ) .    we conclude that in most clusters , the radio halo electrons are probably accelerated by turbulence , but in those rare cases when shocks with @xmath47 are present , these shocks also appear to contribute in the acceleration . in this regard",
    ", we note that kempner & david ( 2003 ) performed a similar radio ",
    "x - ray comparison for another halo cluster , a2744 , and concluded that both turbulence and shock acceleration may be present in that cluster .    in conclusion",
    ", we note that maps of the spectral index of the radio halo emission would be invaluable for pinpointing the electron acceleration sites ( because the halo spectrum steepens as the relativistic electrons lose energy ) .",
    "such data would be especially illuminating in clusters such as e , a665 ( feretti et al . , in preparation ) , and a520 , where both turbulence and shocks are likely to be present and can be separated spatially .",
    "also , for these clusters , higher - resolution halo images are required to determine if the front edges of the halos indeed coincide with the shock fronts .",
