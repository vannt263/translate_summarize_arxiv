    "are quite well understood nowadays due to the progress towards the exact solution of liouville theory achieved in the last decade .    on the other hand , almost nothing is known about theories of 2d gravity in which the matter field has massless excitations but is not conformal invariant .",
    "a typical example of such a theory is the @xmath0 loop model on a honeycomb lattice @xcite .",

    "the aim of this paper is to work out , using the matrix model formulation , explicit expressions for the partition functions of the gravitational @xmath0 model on the disk and on the sphere along the thermal flow . in this section",
    "we give a brief introduction in the @xmath0 model and present our results .",

    "the local fluctuating variable associated with the sites @xmath9 is an @xmath0 spin with components @xmath10 , normalised so that @xmath11 the partition function on the graph @xmath8 is defined as where @xmath12 is the temperature and the product runs over all links @xmath13 of the graph @xmath8 . expanding the trace as a sum of monomials , the partition function can be written as a sum over all configurations of self - avoiding , mutually avoiding loops that can be drawn on @xmath8 , as shown in fig.1 . here",

    "_ summary of the results : _    we have found that the susceptibility @xmath42 is related to the boundary entropy as the function @xmath43 is determined by comparing the expressions for the derivative @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which we obtained by solving the saddle point equations for the @xmath0 matrix model .",

    "as the susceptibility is related to the boundary entropy by ( [ defchi ] ) , it satisfies the transcendental equation which coincides , after a redefinition of the variables , with the eqation found in @xcite for the susceptibility of the gravitational sine - gordon model .",

    "@xcite for the solution in the special case @xmath83 .",
    "it is however more advantageous to reformulate the problem in terms of the collective field , or _ loop operator _ , which is the laplace transform of the disk partition function ( [ diskpf ] ) .",

    "the saddle point equation ( [ sdptcg ] ) can be reformulated as a boundary condition for the current which is analytic on the complex plane cut along the interval @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "namely , the values of @xmath89 on both sides of the cut are related by the function @xmath89 is completely determined by the boundary condition ( [ homfe ] ) and the first four coefficients of its laurent expansion at infinity , which are expressed in terms of @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,    we will split , as in @xcite , the function @xmath89 in two ` chiral ' pieces , satisfying simpler boundary conditions along the cut : the phase @xmath90 is defined by ( [ nnu ] ) . the boundary condition ( [ homfe ] ) , respectively ( [ fucpm ] ) , implies a quadratic functional identity for the current @xcite where @xmath91_{<0}$ ] denotes the negative piece of laurent expansion . therefore @xmath92 is an even polynomial of 4 degree whose coefficients are known functions of @xmath28 and @xmath27 . in order to avoid heavy expressions",
    "we rescale @xmath93 and @xmath80 as and use directly the laurent expansion of the chiral components @xmath94 : the new expansion coefficients are related to the old ones by then ( [ qfue ] ) implies the functional equation where the @xmath95 and @xmath96 are expressed in terms of @xmath97 and the first moment of the eigenvalue density @xmath98 :      the functional equation ( [ ppmi ] ) leads to an algebraic equation for @xmath99 : the value @xmath99 is analytic function of the couplings @xmath100 and @xmath27 in the domain where the loop gas partition function is convergent .",
    "the critical lines are therefore given by the border of the domain of analyticity of @xmath99 .",
    "the latter is given by the condition @xmath101 , or      the riemann surface of @xmath89 consists of infinitely many sheets , except for the case when @xmath90 is a rational number .",

    "2 ) . if we find a global parametrization of the riemann surface that resolves all branch points , then the boundary conditions ( [ fucpm ] ) will become quasi - periodicity conditions and can be solved ( in our case ) in terms of theta functions .",
    "2 : the riemann surface of @xmath89    to illustrate the method , let us first reproduce the solution along the critical line @xmath104 , found originally in @xcite by applying the wiener - hopf method to the integral equation ( [ sdptcg ] ) . along this critical line @xmath83 and the infinity of simple ramification points at @xmath105 merge into a single ramification point of infinite order at @xmath106 .",
    "the riemann surface is then globally parametrized by a hyperbolic map where the points with parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 must be identified .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ fucpm ] ) become a quasi - periodicity conditions in the complex @xmath107-plane : the unique solution of ( [ jose ] ) with the asymptotics ( [ exjpm ] ) is with one can check that the quadratic equation ( [ ppmi ] ) is satisfied with @xmath109 comparing with the asymptotics ( [ exjpm ] ) we find two more relations which determine the left branchpoint @xmath110 and the critical line @xmath111 that describes the dense phase .",
    "the line @xmath111 starts at the critical point @xmath112 where @xmath113 .    in a similar fashion",
    "we calculate the @xmath114-derivative of @xmath115 , which we rescale for convenience as the meromorphic functions @xmath116 satisfy the same boundary condition ( [ jone ] ) but have less singular behavior at infinity : the only solution of ( [ jone ] ) with such asymptotics is we finally obtain for the current ( [ defj ] ) and its derivative the scaling behavior for @xmath117 is where      a solution of the @xmath0 model in the most general case is presented in @xcite . however , we found easier to perform an independent computation rather than to use the results of @xcite",
    ".    for generic values of the couplings there exists a global parametrisation in terms of jacoby elliptic functions .",
