    "while the evolution of dark matter in the standard @xmath1 cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology is reasonably well understood , the evolution of the baryonic component is much less certain because of the complexity of the relevant physical processes , such as star formation and feedback .",
    "one approach to studying the dynamics of baryons in galaxy formation is to use semi - analytic techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that combine the growth of dark matter haloes with subgrid modelling of the baryonic physics @xcite . with semi - analytic models",
    ", it has been shown that the observed luminosity function of galaxies can be reproduced with feedback both from supernovae and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , where the numbers of low - mass and massive galaxies are decreased with supernova and agn feedback , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the other approach is to directly implement star formation and feedback into hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "many simulation codes have been developed for studying galaxy formation and evolution , not only of isolated systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) but also for cosmological simulations of individual galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or of the galaxy population as a whole @xcite . with these simulations ,",
    "it is possible to predict not only averaged properties of galaxies but also internal structures of galaxies , i.e. , kinematics and spatial distribution of stars and gas within galaxies , which have also become available in recent observations with integral field units and multi - object spectrographs . given the computational resources , it is not possible to resolve star - forming clouds , supernova ejecta , and agn , and therefore some parametrizations are inevitable .",
    "however , most of the parameters can be constrained from observations , and we aim to do this in this paper .",
    "supernova and hypernova feedback play an important rle in reducing the peak rate of cosmic star formation and reproducing mass - metallicity relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the ` down - sizing ' phenomenon is not fully reproduced @xcite .",

    ", because most of the stars in massive galaxies have formed in subgalaxies at high - redshift before they merge to the present galaxies , the stellar populations of massive galaxies are older than low - mass galaxies ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for semi - analytic models ) . however , the present star formation rates are still too high in massive galaxies , and thus the specific star formation rates are also too high , and the [ @xmath2/fe ] ratios are too low for massive early - type galaxies . some additional feedback that can efficiently work in massive galaxies is required , and agn feedback is the most plausible .",
    "the importance of black holes has been underscored by the discovery of the relationship between the mass of the central black hole and many properties of the host galaxy , including the mass of the bulge @xcite and stellar velocity dispersion @xcite , indicating co - evolution of black holes and host galaxies ( but see also * ? ? ?",

    "radiative cooling is computed using a metallicity - dependent cooling function @xcite , and molecular cooling is not included , and is not important for the temperatures resolved in our simulations .",

    "the star formation timescale is taken to be proportional to the dynamical timescale ( @xmath15 ) , where @xmath16 is a star formation timescale parameter which we set to @xmath17 @xcite , which gives a better agreement with observations of the cosmic sfr using a kroupa imf than @xmath18 .",

    "the progenitor model of type ia supernovae is based on the single degenerate scenario , and taking account of the metallicity effects of white dwarf winds @xcite , the lifetime distribution functions are calculated as in @xcite .        in previous implementations of agn feedback , a single supermassive black hole is spawned in every dark matter halo of sufficient mass ( typically @xmath4 ) , identified by regular running of the friend of friends routine @xcite .",
    "a gas particle within such a group , which satisfies some criterion ( the most gravitationally bound , or the most dense for example ) , is converted to a black hole , with mass @xmath22 .",
    "this ensures that galaxies that later form in these haloes contain a black hole .",
    "we adopt a different approach for the formation of seed black holes , motivated by the theory of primordial star formation and the observed signatures of the first chemical enrichment . much theoretical",
    "work has been undertaken in understanding how the first black holes formed , with the most likely candidates being as the remnants of populationiii stars or formed by the direct collapse of primordial gas .",
    "for the latter scenario , black holes formed via direct collapse of a massive , low angular momentum gas cloud are likely rare due to the conditions necessary for the collapse to occur . in order to maintain a high jeans mass ,",
    "the gas must not cool efficiently , since @xmath23 .",
    "this may be accomplished by suppressing the formation of h@xmath24 with a strong lyman werner flux , so that cooling is dominated by atomic hydrogen and the gas is not able to fragment .",
    "modeling of such situations can produce seed black holes as large as @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "for the former scenario , the deaths of populationiii stars , either as core collapse supernovae ( @xmath26 ) or by collapsing directly ( @xmath27 ) , could conceivably produce black hole seeds with mass in the range @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "our criteria for forming black holes are therefore as follows : any gas particle satisfying @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the density and metallicity of the gas particle respectively , and @xmath33 a specified critical density , is converted into a black hole with a constant seed mass @xmath34 .",
    "similar criteria were adopted in @xcite to study the occupation fraction of black holes in simulated haloes . from the above discussion , we consider the range @xmath35 .",
    "we treat @xmath33 as a free parameter and determine its value by comparing the final state of simulations with observations ( see section [ sec : rho ] ) .",
    "we therefore restrict neither the number of black holes that form , nor the locations where they form .",
    "note that , due to the limited mass resolution , @xmath34 is much smaller than @xmath36 . as in previous works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we store the mass of the black hole separately and use @xmath36 as the dynamical mass until @xmath37 reaches @xmath36",
    ". we also note that due to the limited spatial resolution of the simulations presented in this paper ( typically a few comoving kpc ) , it is possible for black holes to ` wander ' out of galaxies in a few timesteps solely because of numerical effects . to avoid this artificial effect , at every timestep we calculate the centre of mass of all particles within the smoothing radius of each black hole and reposition the black hole to that location .",
    "the seed black holes grow by both gas accretion and mergers with multiple other black holes . in cosmological hydro - simulations ,",
    "the spatial resolution is usually @xmath38kpc , and thus it is not possible to resolve the detailed physics of accretion near black holes .",
    "it is therefore necessary to use a sub - resolution model for the processes governing the growth of black holes and the feedback from black holes .",
    "we adopt roughly the same model as in many previous works @xcite",
    ". the growth rate due to accretion is taken to be proportional to the bondi - hoyle accretion rate @xcite , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the gas density local to the black hole , @xmath41 is the sound speed of the gas local to the black hole , @xmath42 is the relative velocity between the black hole and local gas , and the constant factor @xmath2 accounts for the finite resolution of the simulations .",
    "in contrast to other works ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mass is accreted from gas particles in a continuous fashion , rather than stochastically accreting entire gas particles . in each timestep @xmath43 ,",
    "gas particles neighbouring a black hole have their mass decreased by an amount @xmath44 times their sph kernel weight . in principle",
    ", this procedure could lead to gas particles with masses much less than the simulation resolution , however the accretion rates are sufficiently low compared to the gas particle mass that this problem does not arise ; at @xmath45 in our fiducial simulation , the lowest mass gas particle has 25 per cent of its original mass , and only 3 per cent of gas particles are less massive than initially .    in previous works ,",
    "values for @xmath2 as low as 1 @xcite , or as high as a few hundred @xcite have been used .",

    "black holes then grow due to accretion at a rate given by @xmath50 @xmath51 denotes the radiative efficiency of the black hole ; we set @xmath52 throughout this paper @xcite .",
    "a merger between black holes may occur if the following conditions are met : @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the relative velocity of the black holes , @xmath56 their separation , and @xmath57 the gravitational softening length of the black holes .",
    "for the condition of equation , we use the local sound speed @xmath41 as a measure of the local velocity scale @xcite , which precludes black holes undergoing a quick flyby from merging .",
    "we note that @xcite used @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the mass of the most massive black hole of the pair .",
    "we do not employ this criterion in the current work since the mass of a black hole as calculated by equation can be several orders of magnitude lower than the dynamical mass of the black hole , used to determine its velocity .",
    "following the merging of black holes , the properties of the primary black hole are updated such that mass and linear momentum are conserved , and it is relocated to the center of mass of the merging particles .",
    "although the processes of black hole binary hardening is still not well understood @xcite , and would not be resolved in these simulations of galaxies in any case , the conditions of equations and cause black holes that would be expected to merge eventually to do so .      in each timestep @xmath43 ,",
    "a black hole produces an amount of energy @xmath60 , which is calculated as @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the fraction of radiated energy that couples to the gas .",
    "previous works have used @xmath62 in the range 0.05 @xcite to 0.15 @xcite ; we treat @xmath62 as a free parameter and determine its value by comparing the final state of simulations with observations ( see section [ sec : epsf ] ) .",

    "because no signatures of the chemical enrichment from pisne have yet been observed ( section [ sec : intro ] ) , we propose the following scenario : the masses of the first stars are @xmath138 due to fragmentation and suppressed accretion , which explode as core - collapse supernovae .",
    "if the accretion is not suppressed , the mass of stellar cores grows beyond @xmath139 , which become our seed black holes .",

    "a constant @xmath62 is applied for all gas at all times .",
    "ultimately , the value of @xmath143 found here should be viewed as a rough average used in lieu of a more accurate expression for @xmath62 based on the properties of the gas around black holes . in reality , the extent to which radiation couples to gas will depend on various factors , including the density and metallicity of gas .",
    "in addition , we only allow the radiation to affect the thermal energy of the gas ; there is no kinetic component , nor do we employ the radiative electromagnetic feedback of @xcite . if the gas is more easily removed from galaxy centres by kinetic coupling , this can reduce the value of @xmath62 .",
    "however , @xcite argued that the mode of coupling is largely irrelevant as long as the feedback energy is distributed in a volume small compared to that of the galaxy , and in a time shorter than the dynamical time of the galaxy .",
    "indeed , even without kinetic feedback , outflows are seen from massive galaxies in our simulations . in the most massive galaxies ,",
    "we find that the wind speed is @xmath144kms@xmath145 at the edge of galaxies , and can be higher near the center as observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    that the value of @xmath62 has no bearing on the cosmic star formation history is surprising , as star formation is directly related to the internal energy of gas particles through the rapid cooling condition .",
    "however , this can be explained by the self - regulation of the black hole growth as follows : the simulations f and e1 - 4 are identical , apart from their value of @xmath62 , which means that , to a good approximation , black holes form at the same locations , at the same times , and with the same masses in each . assuming a power law dependence of @xmath146 on @xmath62 ,",

    "the self - regulated growth also explains the independence of black hole mass on the value of @xmath2 .",
    "again , when and where black holes form is unaffected by the value of @xmath2 .",
    "as before , we assume a power law dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath2 : @xmath156 and calculate @xmath154 as @xmath157 where @xmath158 denotes the mean black hole mass of the simulation with @xmath159 .",

    "our adopted ` best ' value for the minimum gas density for black holes to form , @xmath100 , is not intended as a physical density threshold of the gas that would have formed the first black holes in the universe , because the resolution of our cosmological simulations is insufficient to resolve such small scale physics .",

    "a major cause of uncertainty in our model is our prescription for calculating the accretion rate of gas onto black holes .",
    "we use the bondi - hoyle accretion rate , as in many previous works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this formulation is for spherical accretion in the newtonian regime .",
    "the angular momentum of infalling gas is ignored , which could , more realistically , cause the gas to settle into a disk around the black hole , rather than being accreted by it . jets may form with a strong magnetic field @xcite , which may help remove angular momentum .",
    "additionally , the gravitational potential felt by the gas is assumed to be dominated by the black hole , whereas that of the galaxy will be more important in these simulations . attempts to address some of these issues have been made ; for example , in @xcite a two - component ` accretion disk particle ' is used that models both a black hole and its accretion disk .",
    "gas is accreted onto the disk if it comes within some radius @xmath164 that is of order the gravitational softening length .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , calculate an accretion rate based on angular momentum transport via gravitational torques within the central @xmath165 kpc of galaxies .",
    "such methods require a somewhat higher spatial resolution than in this paper , and we will leave these to a future study .",
    "we have presented a new model for the formation of black holes in cosmological simulations , motivated by the first star formation .",
    "black holes are formed from metal free gas of high enough density .",
    "they may then grow via both mergers and through gas accretion . in this model ,",
    "black holes are formed anywhere in the simulation volume with gas satisfying the above criteria .",
    "we therefore do not restrict black holes to form only within dark matter haloes , as some previous models have , but still find that most galaxies contain at least one black hole by the present .",
    "massive black holes heat the surrounding material , suppressing star formation at the centres of galaxies , and driving galactic winds .",
    "we constrain the parameters of the model by comparing the simulations to observations , and successfully reproduce the black hole mass  galaxy mass relation , the cosmic star formation rate history , and the mass  size relation of galaxies .",

    "we found that black hole mass did not depend on the accretion rate modifier , @xmath2 , and that sfr did not depend on the fraction of radiation that coupled to gas , @xmath62 .",
