    "the fluorescent k@xmath0 iron emission line has been observed in several active galactic nuclei  ( agn ) with a broad and skewed line profile .",
    "the line is thought to be produced by iron fluorescence of a relatively cold x - ray illuminated material in the innermost parts of the accretion disc .",
    "bearing in mind that the line is intrinsically narrow in the local rest - frame of the emitting material , and is transformed into broad , skewed profile by doppler shifts and gravitational redshift effects , thus the line profile encodes the nature of the structure , geometry , and dynamics of the accretion flow in the immediate vicinity of the central black hole , as well as the geometry of the space - time , thereby providing key information on the location and kinematics of the cold material . investigating these spectral features in x - ray luminous black hole systems",
    "opens a unique window allows us to probe the physics that occurs in the vicinity of a black hole , and provides one way to test theory of strong field gravity .",
    "calculations of the line profiles emitted from an accretion disc around a black hole have been performed by several authors .",
    "theoretical fe k@xmath0 line profiles from a thin disc around a schwarzschild black hole were calculated by @xcite . @xcite",
    "extended those to the extreme kerr metric .",
    "these calculations are based on a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disc ( hereafter ssd , following @xcite ) , on which the accreting material is considered to be in keplerian orbit around a central black hole .",
    "further , the line emissivity is assumed to vary with @xmath1 in power - law form .",
    "efforts have been made later on to include various physically plausible processes in the accretion flow , such as spiral wave , disc warp , and disc thickness @xcite , as well as taking into consideration of the geometry and the relative motion of the primary x - ray source @xcite towards a more realistic emissivity distribution .",
    "some authors considered also the ionization effect , the emission from plunging region on the iron k line and reflection spectrum @xcite .    in the calculations ,",
    "two basic approaches have been used to map the disc into the sky plane .",
    "the first method follows photon trajectories starting from a given initial locus of emission region in the local rest frame of the disc to the observer at infinity . in this case a transfer function @xcite is usually introduced as an integration kernel which includes all relativistic effects in line profile calculation .",
    "the integration for the line flux is then performed directly on the surface of the accretion disc .",
    "the transfer function was first introduced by @xcite , who presented the numerical results for a grid of parameters aiming at estimating the relativistic effect on the continuum emission from ssd , and was re - fined and discussed in great detail by @xcite . the second method",
    "adopt a ray tracing approach @xcite .",
    "following the trajectories of photons from the sky plane to the accretion disc , in this method the image of the disc on the observer s sky is derived first and then the line flux is obtained by integrating over this image , weighted by the redshift factor and the radial disc emissivity profile .",
    "recently , @xcite developed a fast , accurate , high - resolution code which can be used to generate high - resolution line profiles numerically .",
    "@xcite extended it to include the contribution of higher - order photons to the line profiles .",
    "but all of these approaches are restricted to ssd .    on the other hand , direct imaging of accretion discs around a black hole",
    "is one of the most exciting areas of study to be considered in the future .",
    "the fact that a black hole posses an event horizon makes a black hole cast a shadow upon the background light with a size of roughly ten gravitational radii that is due to the bending of light by the black hole , and this shadow is nearly independent of the spin or orientation @xcite .",
    "however , for a black hole embedded in an optically thick accretion flow the shape and position of the shadow will be altered regardless of the black hole spin @xcite . from an observational point of view , the highest angular resolution is obtained with very long baseline interferometry at millimetre wavelengths ( so called mm - vlbi ) with an angular resolution of a few ten micro - arcseconds .",
    "this corresponds to a spatial resolution of only a few ten gravitational radii for the nearby galaxies .",
    "future global mm - vlbi array at short millimetre wavelengths therefore should allow to map the direct vicinity of the super massive black holes ( smbh ) such as sgr a * and m87 , and offers new possibilities to study the immediate environment of smbh @xcite . in the x - ray band , the proposed micro - arcsecond x - ray interferometry mission ( maxim ) aims to obtain submicroarcsecond resolution x - ray images of nearby galactic nuclei @xcite . at this resolution",
    ", one can capture the image of an event horizon of the central massive black hole in a nearby agn .",
    "the combination of high resolution radio interferometry and interferometric x - ray spectroscopy would form an powerful tool to study smbh and their environment with high accuracy and provide unprecedented and direct constraints on the dynamics and geometry of the disc , as well as the geometry of the space - time .    with the development of the observational techniques , high - quality observational data will eventually become available . by fitting the data",
    ", one can in principle constrain the parameters of the accretion disc system , this will provide both a direct evidence for the existence of a black hole and a way of quantitative test general relativity in strong gravity . however",
    ", accurate quantitative analysis of observational data requires a sophisticated model that treats all relativistic effects with a realistic accretion disc structure . at present , such a complete model is still not available . to our knowledge",
    ", ssd breaks down when the accretion rate approaches the eddington rate . at this limit",
    "the disc must become geometrically thick and be sub - keplerain @xcite , that is the so called slim disc . for a thick disc",
    ", @xcite pointed out it would be of lower density than a standard @xmath2disc which would increase the ionization parameter  ( flux divided by density ) , thus leads to iron in the inner parts of the disc becoming fully ionized and no iron lines at all . for slim disc",
    ", this may not be the case , the broad , ionized fe k@xmath0 line was discovered in some narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1 ) @xcite , which have been thought to work with high accretion rates .",
    "so , slim disc has been received much more attention because of it can be basically used to account for spectral features in nls1 @xcite . with the increasing evidence for ionized accretion discs in nls1 ,",
    "the spectra and emission lines of slim discs need to be studied in more details . motivated by the above considerations ,",
    "a geometrically and optically thick accretion disc model is presented making an attempt at gaining an insight into the effects of disc geometry and dynamics on the line profiles and disc images .",
    "following the idea presented by @xcite , we extend their method to the finite thick disc , and adopt elliptic integrals to improve the performance of the code which is much faster than the direct integral and widely used by many authors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ method ]",
    "we summarize the assumptions behind our model , and present the basic equations relevant to our problem , while some more technical aspects like the formulae of the integration for photon trajectories expressed in terms of the inverse jacobian elliptic functions are given in appendix  [ integral ] .",
    "we present our results in  [ result ] , and summarize the conclusions and discussion in  [ sum ] .",
    "the aim of this paper is to consider how the accretion disc geometry and dynamics affect the iron k@xmath0 line profiles and disc images . to this end",
    ", the disc shape and structure must be determined first . to obtain a rigorous model ,",
    "one should solve the disc structure equations numerically .",
    "however , this is beyond the scope of the current work . for simplicity",
    ", we adopt a conical surface for the disc geometry .",
    "the thickness of the disc can be described by the half subtending angle @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . when @xmath5 , the disc reduces to ssd .",
    "the complementary angle of @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath6 which is the angle between the symmetric axis of the system and the radial direction of the disc surface .",
    "the parameters of this model include : the radii of the emitting disc zone @xmath7 , the spin of the black hole @xmath8 , the inclination angle of the disc ( @xmath9 ) and the disc surface angle ( @xmath6 ) , the radial emissivity index @xmath10 , the angular velocity index  ( see below ) @xmath11 , respectively . in addition to all of those , the angular dependence of the emissivity also shall be given .",
    "the propagation of radiation from the disc around a kerr black hole and the particle kinematics in the disc were studied by many authors .",
    "we review properties of the kerr metric and formulae for its particle orbits , and summarize here the basic equations relevant to this work . throughout the paper we use units in which @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the gravitational constant , @xmath14 the speed of light .",
    "the background space - time geometry is described by kerr metric . in boyer - lindquist coordinates ,",
    "the kerr metric is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 here @xmath19 , @xmath8 are the black hole mass and specific angular momentum , respectively .",
    "the general orbits of photons in the kerr geometry can be expressed by a set of three constants of motion @xcite .",
    "those are the energy at infinity @xmath20 , the axial component of angular momentum @xmath21 , and carter s constant @xmath22 .",
    "the 4-momentum of a geodesic has components @xmath23 with @xmath24r - a^2 q^2 \\ ; ,   \\\\",

    "the technical details are given in appendix  [ integral ] .",
    "we assume that the disc is of a cone - shaped surface , axisymmetric , and lies on the equatorial plane of the black hole .",
    "photons are emitted or reflected from the gas on the conical disc surface which moves along circular orbits .",
    "the radial drift of the gas on the disc surface is neglected .",
    "thus , the 4-velocity field is chosen to be of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the angular velocity of the emitting gas .",
    "the choice of @xmath27 must satisfy the causality condition . for sub - keplerian velocity",
    ", we adopt the modification of @xmath27 firstly introduced by @xcite @xmath28\\omega , \\label{omega}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the poloidal boyer - lindquist coordinate , @xmath30 is the keplerian angular velocity and @xmath31 is the angular velocity of the gravitational drag .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath32    for describing physical processes near a kerr black hole , boyer - lindquist coordinates , which are unphysical in the ergosphere , are inconvenient . in order to make physics appear simple in their frames ,",
    "the locally nonrotating frames  ( lnrf ) was introduced by @xcite .",
    "the relation between the local rest frame attached to the disc fluid and lnrf is given by a lorentz transformation .",
    "in the lnrf , the azimuthal component of 3-velocity reads @xmath33 the corresponding lorentz factor @xmath34 as measured by lnrf is defined as @xmath35    due to relativistic effects , the photon frequency will shift from the emitted frequency @xmath36 to the observed one @xmath37 received by a rest observer with the hole at infinity .",
    "we introduce a @xmath38 factor to describe the shift which is the ratio of observed frequency to emitted one : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the 4-momentum of the photon , the 4-velocity of the observer and the emitter , respectively .",
    "the specific flux density @xmath41 at frequency @xmath37 as observed by an observer at infinity is defined as the sum of the observed specific intensities @xmath42 from all parts of the accretion disc surface , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the element of the solid angle subtended by the image of the disc on the observer s sky .",
    "we do not consider the effect of higher order images of the disc in the following computations as their contribution is small due to most high order photons reintercept and be absorbed by the disc .",
    "using the fact that @xmath45 is invariant along the path of a photon , where @xmath46 is the photon frequency measured by any local observer on the path , equation  ( [ feo ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath47 @xmath48 is the specific intensity measured by an observer corotating with the disc , and can be approximated by a @xmath3-function , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the emissivity per unit surface area . from well known transformation properties of @xmath3-functions we have @xmath51 ,",
    "using this in equation  ( [ feo1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath52    in order to calculate the integration over @xmath44 , we must first obtain the disc image or find the relation between the element of the solid angle and the disc linked by the null geodesic . the apparent position of the disc image as seen by an observer",
    "is conveniently represented by two impact parameters @xmath0 and @xmath53 , measured relative to the direction to the centre of the black hole .",
    "the impact parameters @xmath0 and @xmath53 are , respectively , the displacements of the image in the directions of perpendicular and parallel to the projection of the black hole spin .",
    "they are related to two constants of motion @xmath54 and @xmath55 by @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath9 is the angle between the observer and the rotation axis of the black hole ( i.e.  the inclination angle ) .",
    "the element of solid angle seen by the observer is then @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the distance from the observer to the black hole .",
    "substituting equation  ( [ solid_obs ] ) into equation  ( [ feo2 ] ) gives the desired result : @xmath59    to perform the integration , the form of the disc emissivity in the integrand also needs to be given .",
    "in general , it can be a function of the radius , @xmath60 and polar angle , @xmath61 , of an emitted photon with the surface normal of the disc in the rest frame of the emitting gas .",
    "this angle is determined by taking the dot - products of the photon four - momentum @xmath62 with the surface normal @xmath63 .",
    "the surface normal in the rest frame is @xmath64 by definition , we get @xmath65 if the emission is isotropic in the rest frame , we do not need to know @xmath61 .",
    "more generally , we take the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the cosine of the emitted angle  ( @xmath68 ) . and the radial emissivity is assumed to vary as a power law with emissivity index @xmath10 : @xmath69 we consider three possible cases for the angular dependence of the emissivity @xcite : ( 1 ) isotropic emission , @xmath70 ; ( 2 ) limb darkening law @xmath71 ; ( 3 ) limb brightening law @xmath72 .      with all of the preparation described in the previous section , we now turn to how to calculate the line profiles and the disc images numerically .",
    "we divide the disc into a number of arbitrarily narrow rings , and emission from each ring is calculated by considering its axisymmetry .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath73 the radius of each such emitting ring .",
    "for each ring there is a family of null geodesic along which radiation flows to a distance observer at polar angle @xmath9 from the disc s axis . as far as the iron k@xmath0 emission line is concerned , for a given observed frequency @xmath37 the null geodesic in this family can be picked out if it exists .",
    "so , the weighted contribution of this ring to the line flux can be determined .",
    "the total observed flux can be obtained by summing over all emitting rings .",
    "changing the observed frequency , then the line profiles will be obtained .",
    "this family of null geodesic for each ring can be used to map the accretion disc onto sky plane , that is , disc imaging .",
    "a geodesic in this family connects an emitting region in the ring to the distant observer .",
    "the constants of motion @xmath54 and @xmath55 of this geodesic can be used to determine the apparent position of the emitting point on the sky plane using the corresponding two impact parameters @xmath0 and @xmath53 .",
    "different geodesic is associated with different point . using geometric optics",
    ", one determines the appearance of the ring from this family of geodesic , then in this way images  ( at infinity ) of the accretion disc are obtained .    the main numerical procedures for computing the line profiles are as follows :    1 .",
    "specify the relevant disc system parameters : @xmath74 and the angular emissivity .",
    "the disc surface is modeled as a series of rings with the radii @xmath73 and weights @xmath75 which calculated using an algorithm due to rybicki g. b. @xcite .",
    "3 .   for a given couple  ( @xmath76 ) of a ring ,",
    "the two constants of motion @xmath54 and @xmath55 are determined if they exist .",
    "this is done in the following way : the value of @xmath54 is obtained by the another form of equation  ( [ gvalue ] ) @xmath77 the value of @xmath55 is determined for solving photon trajectory equation  ( [ r - th ] ) .",
    "then the contribution of this ring on the flux for given frequency @xmath37 with respect to @xmath38 is estimated .",
