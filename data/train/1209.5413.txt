    "+ later it was pointed out in @xcite that such correspondence can be seen as the association of a conformal metric at infinity with level surfaces of the geodesic defining functions of the conformal metric .",
    "in fact , the level surfaces of the geodesic defining function form the regular part of the normal flow ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) of the horospherically convex hypersurfaces both in the hyperbolic metric and the conformally compactified metric .",
    "we refer to the part of the normal flow where each leaf is embedded as the regular part .",
    "+ at first the horospherical support function @xmath22 is defined on the parameter space @xmath23 of an immersed horospherically convex hypersurface @xmath15 .",
    "hence the so - called horospherical metric @xmath24 is originally defined on @xmath23 too .",
    "it is much more useful if the horospherical support function @xmath22 as well as the horospherical metric @xmath25 can be pushed on a domain in @xmath3 through the gauss map @xmath8 . indeed ,",
    "when the gauss map is injective , we may view the hypersurface as a  graph \" of the horospherical support function @xmath26 over the domain @xmath27 in @xmath3 .",
    "though the gauss map of a compact horospherically convex hypersurface is always injective , the gauss map of an immersed , complete , horospherically convex hypersurface in general may not be injective .",
    "+ we notice that the gauss map of a horospherically convex hypersurface is naturally a development map .",
    "hence , as a consequence of the celebrated injectivity result of schoen and yau @xcite , we obtain the following :    [ quick ] suppose that @xmath0 is an immersed , complete , horospherically convex hypersurface and suppose that @xmath28 where @xmath20 are principal curvatures of @xmath21",

    ". then @xmath30    using the uniformly horospherical convexity ( cf .",

    "one of the most important issues in hypersurface theory is about when an immersed hypersurface is embedded .",
    "in contrast to the hadamard type theorem established in @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , it is pointed out in @xcite that even a horospherical ovaloid does not have to be embedded .",

    ". then @xmath21 can be unfolded into an embedded hypersurface along its normal flow eventually .",
    "our approach here is to use the connection between normal flows , geodesic defining functions , and conformal metrics at the infinity for the hyperbolic metric @xmath35 observed in @xcite .",
    "based on the hadamard type theorem established in @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) we are able to obtain the following :    [ embed ] suppose that @xmath0 is a properly immersed , complete , uniformly horospherically convex hypersurface with injective gauss map .",
    "in addition , we assume that the boundary at infinity @xmath31 is a disjoint union of smooth compact submanifolds with no boundary in @xmath3 .",

    "+ equivalently , suppose that @xmath1 is a complete conformal metric on a domain @xmath2 in @xmath3 with bounded curvature .",
    "in addition , we assume that the boundary @xmath36 is a disjoint union of smooth compact submanifolds with no boundary in @xmath3 . then the hypersurface @xmath37 is embedded when @xmath38 is large enough .",
    "it is interesting in the surface side to note that one also gets to know the end structure in the proof of the above theorem ( cf .",
    "remark [ end - structure ] ) .",
    "the above embedding theorem is particularly useful when combining with injectivity theorems in this paper and therefore gives us opportunities to apply the alexandrov refection principle in dealing with immersed hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space .",
    "based on a slight extension of the alexandrov - bernstein theorem in @xcite we obtain the following :    [ bernstein ] suppose that @xmath15 is an immersed , complete , horospherically convex hypersurface with constant mean curvature @xmath39 and @xmath40 then it is a horosphere if its boundary at infinity is a single point in @xmath3 .",
    "this is a strong bernstein theorem for immersed hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space .",

    "both subjects have a long history and both are very important subjects in the fields of differential geometry and partial differential equations . although they are mostly treated separately , there is a clear indication that these two subjects should be intimately related in terms of the types of problems and the tools that have been used . in this paper",
    "we extend the correspondence shown in @xcite and establish the following correspondence between uniformly horospherically convex hypersurfaces and complete conformal metrics with bounded curvature .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is an immersed , complete , uniformly horospherically convex hypersurface with injective gauss map @xmath33 .",
    "then it induces a complete conformal metric @xmath1 on @xmath42 with bounded curvature , where @xmath5 is the horospherical support function and @xmath43 on the other hand , suppose that @xmath1 is a complete metric on a domain @xmath2 in @xmath3 with bounded curvature .",
    "then it induces properly immersed , complete , uniformly horospherically convex hypersurfaces @xmath37 and @xmath44 for @xmath38 large enough .",
    "the correspondence established in the above theorem identifies the problem of finding a properly immersed and complete hypersurface @xmath0 that satisfies certain geometric equation with a prescribed boundary at infinity @xmath31 in @xmath3 @xcite with the problem of finding a complete conformal metric @xmath1 that satisfies the corresponding geometric equation according to on the domain @xmath45 whose boundary @xmath36 is the same as the prescribed boundary at infinity @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "for instance , the method of alexandrov reflection for embedded hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space @xmath4 in @xcite and the method of moving planes ( or spheres ) in @xcite are seen to be the same under the correspondence . as a consequence of our general alexandrov reflection principle for horospherically convex hypersurfaces satisfying elliptic weingarten equations",
    ", we also establish a general alexandrov reflection principle for conformal metrics satisfying fully nonlinear elliptic equations . from this general alexandrov reflection principle ,",
    "we derive , for example , the following delaunay type theorem :    [ liouville - delaunay ] suppose that @xmath46 is a complete conformal metric with bounded schouten tensor on the domain @xmath47 . and suppose that @xmath46 satisfies . then @xmath46 is cylindric .",
    "we would like to remark that this delaunay type theorem should be compared with those in @xcite .",
    "their theorems assume the scalar curvature is nonnegative , while ours assumes the schouten tensor is bounded .",
    "+ to end the introduction we would like to remark that it is not just desirable but imperative for us to consider general fully nonlinear elliptic problems and other than , for example , just the mean curvature equation for hypersurfaces . because , in order to gain the embeddedness and apply the alexandrov reflection principle , we need to unfold a given hypersurface along the normal flow , in which the curvature equation usually does not remain the same .",
    "this is seen , for instance , in the proof of theorem [ th : generalizedalexandrov ] in section 4 .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sect : local ] we recapture the works in @xcite and @xcite and clarify the relation of geodesic defining functions and normal flows . in section [ sect : global ] we develop the global correspondence between admissible hypersurfaces @xmath4 and realizable metrics on domains in @xmath3 .",
    "we also prove that an admissible hypersurface can be unfolded into an embedded one along the normal flow when the boundary at infinity is a disjoint union of smooth compact submanifolds with no boundary in @xmath3 . in section [",
    "sect : ellipticity ] we establish the full correspondence between elliptic problems from the two sides .",
    "in particular , we compare alexandrov theorems with obata theorems , bernstein theorems with liouville theorems and even delaunay type theorems .",
    "in fact we extend a general symmetry result in @xcite for both admissible hypersurfaces and realizable metrics based on our embedding theorem .    0.2in*acknowledgment * the authors would like to express their gratitude to the beijing international center for mathematical research .",

    "we will use horospheres to define the gauss map of an oriented , immersed hypersurface in hyperbolic space @xmath4 . in the above hyperboloid model ,",

    "in this section we compare the elliptic problems associated with weingarten hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space @xmath4 to those of conformal metrics on domains of the conformal infinity @xmath3 .",
