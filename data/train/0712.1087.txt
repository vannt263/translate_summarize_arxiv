    "the breakdown of space and time translation invariance leads to geometric and temporal surface effects .",
    "the former is very common in a system whose spatial correlation length is comparable to its dimensions .",
    "such effects become even more important when nano - scale materials are concerned . in a recent experiment , for example , an anomalous temperature profile of the phase transitions",
    "was observed in the presence of a ferromagnetic surface @xcite .",
    "the latter occurs in a nonequilibrium system , which is prepared by suddenly quenching the system to its critical temperature from any given initial condition .",
    "the breakdown of space translation invariance modifies the critical behaviors near geometric surface and new critical exponents must be introduced .",
    "there may exist several universality classes in one bulk system in the presence of free geometric surface .",
    "the critical behavior of geometric surface has been extensively studied , and the equilibrium phase diagram has been well established in the past decades @xcite . however , most previous studies concentrated on the static behaviors @xcite and the dynamics in the long - time regime@xcite , i.e. system only with geometric surface . the critical dynamics of surface in the _ macroscopic _ short - time regime , i.e. , when the system is still far from equilibrium , is much less touched @xcite .    on the other hand , for a system quenched to its critical temperature , because there is no characteristic time scale , the temporal surface has long - lasting effect",
    "this effect has very important consequences .",
    "one is that in nonequilibrium dynamic relaxation of magnetization , if in the initial state , there is small , nonvanishing magnetization @xmath3 , the magnetization grows as @xmath4 with @xmath5 being a new nonequilibrium dynamic exponent@xcite . in such short - time",
    "critical dynamics , there exist two competing nonequilibrium dynamic processes .",
    "one is the domain growth with scaling dimension @xmath6 and the other is the critical thermal fluctuation with scaling dimension @xmath7 . because the spatial correlation length @xmath8 grows as @xmath9 , we can relate @xmath5 to @xmath6 and @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "generally @xmath6 is larger than @xmath10 and the net effect is the domain growth in the nonequilibrium relaxation process .",
    "this short - time critical dynamics of bulk has been established in the past decade , and successfully applied to different physical systems @xcite .",
    "based on the short - time dynamic scaling , new techniques for the measurements of both dynamic and static critical exponents as well as the critical temperature have been developed @xcite .",
    "recent progresses can be found partially in refs .",
    "@xcite .    obviously , the physical phenomena are more complicated , when both temporal and geometric surfaces are considered .",
    "the interplay between both surfaces embraces many interesting physics and is worth for careful studies@xcite .",
    "recently it is reported that in non - equilibrium states , the surface cluster dissolution may take place instead of the domain growth @xcite . in these studies , the dynamic relaxation starting from a high - temperature state is concerned .",
    "the impact of defect on geometric surface is also of great concern .",
    "the presence of imperfection may alter the surface university classes and even the phase diagram .",
    "the former is easily signaled from the non - equilibrium dynamics as in the case of bulk@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the short - time critical dynamics on _ a perfect and non - perfect surface _ with monte carlo simulations . we generalize the universal dynamic scaling behavior to the dynamic relaxation at geometric surfaces , starting from the _ ordered _ state . at the ordinary , special and surface phase transitions , the dynamic scaling behavior of the surface magnetization , susceptibility and appropriate cumulant",
    "are identified .",
    "the static exponent @xmath1 of the surface magnetization and @xmath2 of the line magnetization of the defect line are extracted from the dynamic behavior in the macroscopic short - time regime .",
    "the robustness of surface university class against extended defect is investigated by means of non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "the surface transition and special transition can also be detected from the short - time dynamics .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the definition of the model and the short - time dynamic scaling analysis are presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] , the dynamic relaxation on a perfect and non - perfect surface is studied . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , the results are summarized .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath0 ising model with glauber dynamics and line defect on free surface in the absence of external magnetic field can be written as the sum of bulk interactions , surface interactions and line interactions , @xmath12 where spin @xmath13 can take values @xmath14 and @xmath15 indicates the summation over all nearest neighbors .",
    "the first sum runs over all links including at least one site that does not belong to the surface , whereas the second sum runs over all surface links excluding the links that both sites are inside the defect line .",
    "the last summation extends over all links which belong to the defect line .",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the coupling constants for the bulk , surface and defect line respectively .",
    "for ferromagnetic materials , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are positive .",
    "it is generally believed that the dynamic universality class of glauber dynamics is insensitive to the detailed algorithm used as long as the updating algorithm is local .",
    "here we use metropolis spin - flip algorithm . without explicitly specified",
    ", the dynamic exponent refers to the ising model with glauber dynamics in the following discussions .    for a perfect surface , i.e. , @xmath19",
    ", it is well known that there exists a special threshold @xmath20 in equilibrium . for @xmath21 ,",
    "the surface undergoes a phase transition at the bulk transition temperature @xmath22 , due to the divergent correlation length in the bulk .",
    "this phase transition is called _ the ordinary transition _ , and the critical behavior is independent of @xmath23 . see fig .",
    "this is a _",
    "strong _ universality . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the surface first becomes ferromagnetic at a surface transition temperature @xmath25 , while the bulk remains to be paramagnetic .",
    "if the temperature is further reduced , the bulk becomes also ferromagnetic at @xmath22 .",
    "the former phase transition is called _ the surface transition _ and the latter is called _ the extraordinary transition_. it is generally believed that the surface transition belongs to the universality class of the @xmath26 ising model @xcite . around @xmath27 occurs the crossover behavior . at",
    "exactly @xmath28 , the lines of surface transition , ordinary transition and extraordinary transition meet at this multicritical point with new surface exponents .",
    "the surface and bulk become critical simultaneously at this point and this phase transition is called _ the special transition_. the best estimate of @xmath27 for the @xmath0 ising in equilibrium is @xmath29 @xcite .    for a non - perfect surface",
    ", we introduce a defect line with coupling strength @xmath18 onto the surface . generally speaking",
    ", the impact of imperfection on a surface is two fold .",
    "take a surface with random bond disorder as an example .",
    "the randomness may reduce the surface transition temperature , and alter the global phase diagram of a semi - infinite system .",
    "for example , the special transition point of the ising model with a amorphous surface is located at @xmath30 @xcite , noticeably larger than that of the ising model with a perfect surface @xmath31 .",
    "another effect of the randomness is that it may change the universality class of the surface .",
    "the relevance or irrelevance of random imperfections on the pure surface can be assessed by the harris - type criterion @xcite . the extended - harris criterion states that for a surface with random bond disorder , the disorder is relevant for @xmath32 but irrelevant for @xmath33 .",
    "based on this criterion , the random surface coupling of the ising model is irrelevant at the ordinary transition since @xmath33 . in this case",
    ", it was rigorously proved @xmath34 by diehl based on the griffiths - kelly - sherman inequality , where @xmath35 is the critical exponent at the ordinary transition on a random bond surface@xcite .",
    "the situation is less clear at the special transition , for @xmath36 is very close to @xmath37 .",
    "recent simulations suggest that @xmath33 and hence the disorder is irrelevant@xcite .",
    "the irrelevance at the special transition has also been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . at the surface transition , the surface is equivalent to the @xmath26 ising model .",
    "the disorder only leads to logarithm correction ( see @xcite and reference therein ) . in the case of defect line",
    ", the defect does nt shift the transition temperatures of the surface transition , and therefore , the special transition point @xmath27 at which the surface transition line and ordinary transition line meet remains to be unchanged @xcite .",
    "we only consider the robustness of the ordinary , special and surface transition in the presence of line defect .",
    ".the bulk critical temperature and critical exponents of the @xmath0 ising model . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tbl3 ]    to investigate the impact of the line defect at the surface transition , we fix @xmath38 .",
    "we measure the time evolution of the line magnetization at its transition temperature @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , one observes that after a microscopic time @xmath44mcs , the power - law behavior emerges .",
    "however , the exponent @xmath2 is @xmath18-dependent , and the strong universality is violated .",
    "this is similar to the case in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a non - universal behavior of the edge and corner magnetization has been found at the surface transition .",
    "since the surface transition is essentially two - dimensional , one may relate this non - perfect surface to the @xmath26 ising model with a defect line _ without the presence of bulk_. the violation of the strong universality of the @xmath26 ising model with a line or a ladder defect is rigorously proved by bariev @xcite . for the line defect ,",
    "exact calculations show that @xmath45 with @xmath46 the critical exponent @xmath2 reduces monotonically , when the defect coupling @xmath18 is enhanced .",
    "we measure the exponent @xmath2 and compare it with the exact values obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ exact1 ] ) and ( [ exact2 ] ) .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tbl3 ] .",
    "one finds a good agreement between simulations and exact results . a similar behavior of the edge magnetization , which can be viewed as a line defect at the surface transition , is also observed in ref .",
    "our results support that at the surface transition , the critical exponent @xmath2 will change in the presence of a small perturbation .",
    "finally , the susceptibility @xmath47 and cumulant @xmath48 of the line magnetization , which are similarly defined as those of the surface magnetization , are also measured .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f6a ] and [ f6b ] .",
    "simple scaling analysis shows that @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the estimated exponents are also compiled in table [ tbl3 ] , and a good consistency with the theory can be spotted .",
    "with monte carlo simulations , we have studied the dynamic relaxation on a perfect and non - perfect surface in the @xmath0 ising model , starting from an ordered initial state . on the perfect surface ,",
    "the dynamic behavior of the surface magnetization , susceptibility and appropriate cumulant is carefully analyzed at the ordinary , special and surface transition .",
    "the universal dynamic scaling behavior is revealed , and the static exponent @xmath1 of the surface magnetization , the static exponent @xmath51 of the surface susceptibility and the dynamic exponent @xmath52 are estimated .",
    "all the results for @xmath1 are compiled in table [ tbl2 ] .",
    "since the exponents @xmath53 and @xmath52 can be identified as those at bulk , it is convenient to study different phase transitions from the non - equilibrium dynamic relaxation .",
    "especially , the dynamic crossover scaling form in eq .",
    "( [ neqcs ] ) is interesting .",
    "because of the existence of new scaling variable @xmath23 , the nonequilibrium relaxation of magnetization at the critical temperature may not obey a power law , which is quite different from the general systems investigated so far where a power law behavior was always expected .",
    "this unusual nonequilibrium behavior is a consequence of the presence of geometric surface .    on the non - perfect surface ,",
    "i.e. , with a defect line in the surface , the universality class of the ordinary transition remains the same as that at the perfect surface .",
    "on the other hand , for the special and surface transitions , the critical exponent @xmath2 of the line magnetization varies with the coupling @xmath18 strength of the defect line .",
    "the susceptibility and appropriate cumulant of the line magnetization also exhibit the dynamic scaling behavior and yield the static exponent @xmath54 and the dynamic exponent @xmath52 .",
    "the short - time dynamic approach is efficient in understanding the surface critical phenomena .",
