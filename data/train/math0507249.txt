    "some classes of combinatorial objects naturally possess a substantial amount of symmetry and when formal sums of monomials encoding some parameter of interest are taken over the entire class , symmetric functions , or symmetric series appear .",
    "there has been some recent activity to determine how to extract enumerative series of sparse sub - families of these classes directly from the symmetric functions .",
    "the principle can be illustrated with one well studied example , the subset of labelled graphs in which the degree of each vertex is a fixed value , say @xmath0 , known as the _ @xmath0-regular graphs_. here , we encode a graph by its degree sequence .",
    "when we consider the sum of this encoding over all graphs , they are encoded by the infinite product @xmath1 this is a well known symmetric series .",
    "further , we remark that the coefficient of @xmath2 in the formal power series development gives the number of labelled @xmath0-regular graphs on @xmath3 vertices .",
    "such a coefficient extraction can be set up as a multidimensional cauchy integral , as described by mckay for regular tournaments and eulerian digraphs  @xcite , and by mckay and wormald for graphs with a fixed degree sequence  @xcite .",
    "however , in general this may not be a useful or practical formula .",
    "indeed these techniques are well developed , and provide general formulae which we can not currently obtain with the methods here , but they are difficult to make systematic , as they contain a saddle point analysis to make the asymptotic estimate which may be quite fine and specific to the problem .",
    "the primary goal here is to lucidly illustrate how techniques for computing the scalar product of symmetric functions in  @xcite can be a part of an essentially algorithmic process for asymptotic analysis . at the heart of the method",
    "is the fact that the scalar product of symmetric functions preserves a notion of d - finiteness  @xcite , and , thanks to the algorithms in  @xcite , this result is effective .",
    "we begin with a short recollection of symmetric series and d - finiteness , and a brief discussion on some places that d - finite symmetric series appear in combinatorics .",
    "we analyse graphs with fixed finite degree sets , and hypergraphs .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : asympt ] , we have the results of our semi - automated asymptotic analysis of these classes .",
    "we provide a basic summary of symmetric functions in order to establish notation .",
    "the reader is directed to macdonald s book  @xcite for full details .",
    "denote by @xmath4 a partition of the integer  @xmath3 .",
    "this means that @xmath5 and  @xmath6 , which we also denote  @xmath7 .",
    "partitions serve as indices for the five principal symmetric function families that we use : homogeneous ( @xmath8 ) , power ( @xmath9 ) , monomial ( @xmath10 ) , elementary ( @xmath11 ) , and schur ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "these are series in the infinite set of variables , @xmath13 over a field  @xmath14 of characteristic  0 .",
    "when the indices are restricted to all partitions of the same positive integer  @xmath3 , any of the five families forms a basis for the vector space of symmetric polynomials of degree  @xmath3 in  @xmath13 on the other hand , the family of @xmath15 s indexed by the integers  @xmath16 generates the algebra  @xmath17 of symmetric functions over  @xmath14 : @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , the  @xmath15 s are algebraically independent over  @xmath19 .    generating series of symmetric functions live in the larger ring of symmetric series , @xmath20[[p_1,p_2,\\dotsc]]$ ] .",
    "there , we have the generating series of homogeneous and elementary functions : @xmath21 we often refer to @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "alternatively , the power notation @xmath24 for partitions indicates that @xmath25  occurs @xmath26  times in  @xmath27 , for  @xmath28 . the normalization constant @xmath29 plays the role of the square of a norm of  @xmath9 in the following important formula : @xmath30 where @xmath31  is  1 if @xmath32 and 0 otherwise .",
    "the scalar product is a basic tool for coefficient extraction . indeed ,",
    "if we write @xmath33 in the form  @xmath34 , then the coefficient of @xmath35 in  @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , when @xmath38 , the identity @xmath39 yields a simple way to compute this coefficient when @xmath36 is written in the basis of the  @xmath40 s . when viewed at the level of generating series , this fact gives the following theorem :    [ thm : theta ] let @xmath41 be the @xmath14-algebra homomorphism from the algebra of symmetric functions over  @xmath14 to the algebra  @xmath42 $ ] of formal power series in  @xmath43 defined by @xmath44 , @xmath45 for @xmath46 . then if @xmath36 is a symmetric function , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the coefficient of @xmath49 in  @xmath36 .",
    "to end our brief recollections of symmetric functions recall that plethysm is a way to compose symmetric functions .",
    "an inner law of  @xmath17 , denoted @xmath50 $ ] for @xmath51 in  @xmath17 , it satisfies the following rules  @xcite , with @xmath52 and   @xmath53 in  @xmath14 @xmath54=\\alpha u[w]+\\beta v[w ] ,    \\quad    ( uv)[w]=u[w]v[w],\\ ] ] and if @xmath55 then @xmath56=\\sum_\\lambda c_\\lambda p_{(n\\lambda_1)}p_{(n\\lambda_2)}\\ldots$ ] .",
    "for example , consider that @xmath57=p_n[w]$ ] , and in particular that @xmath58=p_{nm}$ ] . in a mnemonic way : @xmath59=w(p_{1n},p_{2n},\\dots , p_{kn},\\ldots ) \\qquad\\text{whenever}\\qquad w = w(p_1,p_2,\\dots , p_k,\\ldots).\\ ] ]      recall that a series @xmath60 $ ] is _ d - finite _ in @xmath61 when the set of all partial derivatives and their iterates , @xmath62 , spans a finite - dimensional vector space over the field @xmath63 .",
    "d - finite description _ of a series  @xmath36 is a set of differential equations which establishes this property .",
    "a typical example of such a set is a system of @xmath3  differential equations of the form @xmath64 where @xmath25  ranges over @xmath65 , each  @xmath66 is in @xmath67 for @xmath68 , and @xmath0 and  @xmath66 depend on  @xmath25 .",
    "such a system is a typical example of a d - finite description of a functions , and often this will be the preferred form for manipulating  @xmath69 . in truth we can accept any basis which generates the vector space of partial derivatives , but in the applications below , this form is particularly easy to obtain .",
    "the following definition of d - finiteness of series in an infinite number of variables is given by gessel  @xcite , who had symmetric functions in mind .",
    "a series @xmath70 $ ] is _ d - finite _ in the @xmath71 if the specialization to 0 of all but a finite ( arbritrary ) choice , @xmath72 , of the variable set results in a d - finite function ( in the finite sense ) . in this case , many of the properties of the finite multivariate case hold true .",
    "one exception is closure under algebraic substitution , which requires additional hypotheses .    the definition is then tailored to symmetric series by considering the algebra of symmetric series as generated over  @xmath14 by the set @xmath73 : a symmetric series is called _ d - finite _ when it is d - finite in the @xmath15 s or @xmath74 basis . ] .",
    "both @xmath75 and @xmath76 are d - finite symmetric functions , as for any specialization of all but a finite number of the @xmath15 s to 0 results in an exponential of a polynomial . similarly , @xmath77 is d - finite because @xmath78 is a polynomial in the @xmath15s .",
    "the closure under hadamard product of d - finite series  @xcite yields the consequence :    [ thm : rsc_pres_df ] let @xmath69 and @xmath79 be elements of @xmath80[[p_1,p_2,\\dotsc]]$ ] , d - finite in the @xmath15 s and @xmath81 s , and suppose that @xmath79 involves only finitely many of the @xmath15 s",
    ". then @xmath82 is d - finite in the @xmath81 s provided it is well - defined as a power series .      in our initial study",
    "@xcite we gave an algorithm which , given a d - finite descriptions of two functions satisfying the hypothesis of theorem  [ thm : rsc_pres_df ] , determines a d - finite description of the series of the scalar product .",
    "henceforth , we shall refer to this algorithm as  . as we noted in  @xcite ,",
    "a second algorithm ,  , based on the work of goulden , jackson and reilly  @xcite applies in the case when @xmath83 , which we shall see is precisely how one can extract the exponential generating series of sub - classes with `` regularity '' .",
    "they are implemented in maple , are are available for public distribution at the website http://www.math.sfu.ca/`~`mmishna .",
    "maple worksheets illustrating the calculations presented are also available at that same site .",
    "species theory ( in the sense of  @xcite ) is formalism for defining and manipulating combinatorial structures which relates classes to encoding series .",
    "an important connection to our work here is that the series for structures we consider are d - finite symmetric series , and many of the natural combinatorial actions preserve d - finiteness on the level of these series .",
    "the reader unfamiliar with species is heartily encouraged to consult  @xcite .",
    "a _ species _ associates to every set a family of structures in a way such that two sets of the same cardinality yield the same family , upto isomorphism .",
    "for example , the species of sets @xmath84 on the underlying set @xmath85 is simply @xmath86=u$ ] .",
    "the species of lists @xmath87=\\{(x_1 , x_2 , \\dots , x_n ) :    x_i\\in u , n=0,1,2\\dots\\}$ ] , is the set of finite ordered collections of elements .",
    "the atomic species , @xmath88 $ ] is @xmath85 if @xmath85 contains a single element , and is empty otherwise .",
    "the theory of species develops a rigorous formalism which allows a sort of calculus of combinatorial families .",
    "for example we construct lists of length 4 from our atomic species via multiplication : @xmath89=x^4[u]$ ] .    the key feature that we use",
    "are that for every combinatorial family ( species ) @xmath90 that one can define , there is an associated cycle index series @xmath91 and an asymmetric cycle index series  @xmath92 both of which are symmetric series .",
    "recall for any species its cycle index series @xmath91 is the series in @xmath93\\!]$ ] given by @xmath94     \\frac{p_1^{m_1}p_2^{m_2}\\cdots p_k^{m_k}}{z_\\lambda},\\ ] ] where the value of @xmath95 $ ] is the number of structures of @xmath90 which remain fixed under some labelling permutation of type has @xmath96 fixed points , @xmath97 cycles of length 2 , etc . ]",
    "@xmath27 , and @xmath98 gives the number of parts of @xmath27 equal to  @xmath0 .",
    "the definition of the _ asymmetry index series _ of a species  @xmath90 , denoted  @xmath92 , as introduced by labelle  @xcite is related , but more subtle .",
    "the series  @xmath99 behaves analytically in much the same way as the cycle index series , notably , substitution ( in almost all cases ) is reflected by plethysm , etc . essentially , this series counts the objects with no internal symmetry .",
    "table  [ tab : smallspec ] contains some small examples of both series .    .index",
    "series of small species and their corresponding symmetric functions [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    ' '' ''     formula & constant +   + @xmath100 & & a00986 & @xmath101 & @xmath102 + @xmath103 & & a110040 & @xmath104 & 0.007 + @xmath105 & @xmath106 & a110039 & @xmath107 & 0.43 + @xmath108 & & a110041 & @xmath109 & 0.05 +   + 1 & @xmath110 & a025035 & @xmath111 & 1 + 2 & @xmath110 & a110100 & @xmath112 & 0.175 + 3 & & a110101 & @xmath113 & 0.037 +   + 1 & @xmath114 & a110102&@xmath115 & 1 + 2 & @xmath116&a110103&@xmath117&0.100 +    ' '' ''    there are a few observations we can make based on this data .",
    "we see that allowing repetitions influences only the constant of the asymptotic expansion , and often only slightly .",
    "we see this again in the cycle covers in table  [ tab : other ] .",
    "the formulas look different than the graph formulas we presented earlier , however if we expand the factorials with stirling s formula for @xmath118 , we quickly see that they are the same .",
    "although we are able to compute the differential equations for the generating functions of the classes of 4-regular ( multi- ) graphs ( with loops ) , their asymptotic analysis is more complicated to do in an automated fashion , because a saddle point analysis arises .",
    "this is an obvious starting point for future work .",
    "most of the tools are already implemented , it is mostly a question of understanding them , and determining how to best automate them .",
    "we could make further observations by considering directed versions of any of these structures . for directed graphs ,",
    "we need only consider @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the species of lists of length @xmath0 , and we could generalize hypergraphs in a number of ways ; by putting an order , or even an orientation on each `` edge '' using the species of cycles or lists , as in the directed graph case .",
    "coefficients of taylor expansions of algebraic functions have a known kind of expansion , that can in fact we used to establish the transcendence of some series  @xcite .",
    "we can also describe asymptotic discrepancy criteria for coefficients of d - finite functions .",
    "as we remarked earlier , coefficients of d - finite series are also restricted in their asymptotic growth .",
    "a more complete version of this criteria is following theorem presented in wimp and zeilberger  @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath121 is a d - finite series in in @xmath122 $ ] .",
    "then , for sufficiently large @xmath3 , the coefficients @xmath123 have an asymptotic expansion which is a sum of terms of the form @xmath124 where @xmath125 , @xmath126 is a polynomial and @xmath127 , are complex numbers .",
    "we may ask ourselves , have our examples encompassed the full asymptotic potential of d - finite sequences ?",
    "we are very curious about the combinatorial structure of families which do have such expansions .",
    "are d - finite species sufficient to consider ?    for example , in our earlier study of @xmath0-uniform young tableaux  @xcite , which are enumerated by the scalar product @xmath128 , \\exp(h_kt)\\right\\rangle$ ] have a conjectured form ( verified for @xmath129 ) of @xmath130}\\sim \\frac1{\\sqrt2}\\left(\\frac{e^{k-2}}{2\\pi}\\right)^{k/4 } n!^{k/2 - 1}\\left(\\frac{k^{k/2}}{k!}\\right)^n\\frac{\\exp(\\sqrt{kn})}{n^{k/4 } } , \\qquad n\\rightarrow\\infty.\\ ] ] this is an exact conjecture , more complete than the examples we have presented here , although it results from the same kind of calculation , and presumably if we completed the complex saddle point analyses required for the @xmath131 cases , we might be able to guess such a form for our examples .",
    "it is also of interest to note that while in some cases operations of summation and integration preserve d - finiteness , @xmath132 , the class of _ all _ regular graphs is not d - finite .",
    "the same is true of all the classes we have presented here : although for any @xmath0 , the subclass of @xmath0-regular objects is d - finite , the larger subclass of regular objects is not .",
    "this is interesting and can help us refine our notion of d - finiteness .",
    "we have thus far restrained ourselves from defining a notion of d - finite species .",
    "ideally , such a theory would contain two main components : a `` d - finite species '' should satisfy some sort of system combinatorial differential equations with polynomial coefficients ; and symmetric series of such species should be d - finite .",
    "we would then expect to be able to have theorems of the form :    1 .",
    "[ eq : cis1 ] if and are d - finite species , then so are @xmath133 , and @xmath134 , @xmath135 ; 2 .",
    "[ eq : cis2 ] if is a polynomial species , ( in particular , if its cycle index series is a polynomial ) , then @xmath136 is a d - finite species ; 3 .",
    "[ eq : cis3 ] if satisfies an `` algebraic equation '' of species , including for instance , equations of the form @xmath137 for polynomial species @xmath138 , then @xmath90 is a d - finite species .      finally , much work has been done to characterize combinatorial classes of objects with rational and algebraic generating series ( see  @xcite for a recent summary ) , and hopefully this work is a step towards such a characterization for d - finite generating functions .",
    "we are encouraged by a recent thought of flajolet , gerhold and salvy  @xcite ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ almost every thing is non - holonomic unless it is holonomic by design . + _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    ( series are holonomic if and only if they are d - finite . )",
    "they follow this with the remark that there are several surprising exceptions to this rule , notably @xmath0-regular graphs .",
    "hopefully we have demonstrated that this is nt so surprising ; that in fact , there are deep reasons underlying the d - finiteness of objects with this sort of regularity , and that furthermore , this d - finiteness can be exploited in an automatic way .",
