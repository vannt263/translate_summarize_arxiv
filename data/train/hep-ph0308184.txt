    "an important feature of the phase transitions of higgs fields expected at the early stages of cosmological evolution is formation of topological defects , whose concentration can be roughly estimated as @xmath0 here , @xmath1  3 , 2 , and 1 for the monopoles , cosmic strings , and domain walls , respectively ; and @xmath2 is the effective correlation length , which is commonly assumed to be less than the cosmological causality horizon , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the speed of light , and @xmath5 is hubble constant at the instant of phase transition .",
    "so , the resulting concentration of the defects should be @xmath6 which exceeds considerably the upper limits following from the observational data ( e.g.  review  @xcite ) .    for the sake of definiteness",
    ", we shall further consider the simplest type of defects ",
    "the domain walls .",
    "in such a case , their excessive concentration can result in the @xmath7-dependence for the evolution of cosmological scale factor , leaving less time for galaxy formation and changing the rate of nucleosynthesis .",
    "in addition , the domain walls can produce unreasonably large distortions in the cosmic microwave background radiation  @xcite .    a commonly - used approach to resolve the domain - wall problem is to introduce some mechanism of their annihilation , for example , utilizing the concept of the so - called `` biased '' ( or asymmetric ) vacuum  @xcite .",
    "as a result , under appropriate choice of parameters of the fields involved , the regions of `` false '' ( energetically unfavorable ) vacuum will quickly disappear , eliminating the corresponding domain walls .",
    "( a detailed discussion of the various regimes of evolution can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "unfortunately , the concept of the biased vacuum is not sufficiently supported by realistic models of elementary particles .",
    "so , it becomes interesting to seek for solution of the problem by another way , namely , to answer the question if there are some mechanisms reducing the commonly - used lower limit on the topological defect concentration  ( [ standard_limit ] ) . to examine the efficiency of formation of the defects by the strongly - nonequilibrium symmetry - breaking phase transitions ,",
    "a number of experiments was carried out recently in the condensed - matter systems , such as liquid crystals  @xcite , superfluid @xmath8  @xcite and @xmath9  @xcite , and superconductors both in the form of bulk samples  @xcite and quasi - one - dimensional structures  @xcite .",
    "( the comprehensive review was given , for example , by kibble  @xcite . )    as was established in the last - mentioned experiment , utilizing the multi - josephson - junction loop ( mjjl )  @xcite , the probability of occurrence of various field configurations during the phase transition can be estimated much better if the energy concentrated in the defects is taken into account .",
    "the main aim of the present article is to apply this idea to the consideration of cosmological phase transitions and , thereby , to find the range of parameters at which formation of the domain walls can be substantially suppressed even without any assumption of asymmetry ( or bias ) of the vacuum states .",
    "a general scheme of the mjjl experiment is shown in fig .",
    "[ mjjl_exp ] : a thin loop produced of the high - temperature yba@xmath10cu@xmath11o@xmath12 superconductor and interrupted by 214 josephson junctions at the grain boundaries is rapidly cooled from the normal to superconducting phase ( namely , from @xmath13  k to 77  k ) .",
    "sketch of the mjjl experiment .",
    ", width=264 ]    at @xmath14  k , the segments separated by junctions become superconducting ; however the junctions are still normal and , therefore , the superconducting segments are effectively separate .",
    "so , a random phase of the superconducting order parameter should be established in each of them .    at subsequent cooling down to the temperature @xmath15 ( which is @xmath16  k below @xmath17 )",
    ", the josephson junctions also become superconducting , so that a superconducting current @xmath18 is formed along the entire loop . as a result",
    ", the loop will be penetrated by the magnetic flux @xmath19 , which is just the measurable quantity .",
    "( this is quite close to the original idea by zurek  @xcite , who proposed to observe a spontaneous rotation produced by the superfluid phase transition in a thin annular tube . )    because of the phase jumps between the isolated segments formed at the stage when @xmath20 , the final magnetic flux through the loop is nonzero and varies randomly from one heating  cooling cycle to another .",
    "its histogram @xmath21 derived from 166 cycles is well described by the normal ( gaussian ) law with zero average value and standard deviation @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the magnetic flux quantum ) .",
    "in fact , the above - written experimental value is unreasonably large : if the phase jumps between the segments would be absolutely independent of each other , then the expected width of the distribution should be only @xmath24 .",
    "on the other hand , the excessive experimental value was satisfactorily explained by the authors of this experiment under assumption that the phases of superconducting order parameter in the isolated segments are correlated to each other so that probability @xmath25 of phase jump @xmath26 at the @xmath27th junction is given by gibbs law : @xmath28 \\ , , \\label{mjjl_corr}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the energy concentrated in the josephson junction , @xmath30 is the temperature , and @xmath31 is boltzmann constant .",
    "so , the main conclusion from the results of the above experiment is that the energy concentrated in the defects should be taken into account in calculating the probability of realization of the corresponding field configurations , even if the defects are located at distances exceeding the effective correlation length of the phase transition . in other words ,",
    "the correlation length represents a size of the minimal domain in which the field must be uniform , but it can not be considered as the scale beyond which the field states are absolutely independent of each other .",
    "of course , for the correlations at the larger scales to take place , the corresponding regions should have the possibility to interact with each other in the course of the previous evolution , before the phase transition .",
    "( for the sake of brevity , we shall call them to be in a coherent state . )",
    "the last - mentioned condition is satisfied automatically in the laboratory systems but requires a special consideration in the cosmological applications ( see inequality  ( [ coher_state ] ) below ) .",
    "first of all , we should emphasize close similarity between the symmetry - breaking phase transitions in the multi - josephson - junction loop , drawn in fig .",
    "[ mjjl_exp ] , and the simplest one - dimensional ( 1d ) friedmann  robertson  walker ( frw ) cosmological model . to make the quantitative estimates ,",
    "let us consider the space ",
    "time metric @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the scale factor of frw model ) and the real scalar field @xmath34 ( simulating higgs field ) whose lagrangian @xmath35    \\ , - \\ : \\frac{\\lambda}{4 } \\ ,    { \\big [ \\ , { \\varphi}^2 \\ ! - \\left ( { \\mu}^2 / \\lambda \\right ) \\big]}^2 \\label{lagrangian}\\ ] ] possesses @xmath36 symmetry group , to be broken by the phase transition .",
    "( the resulting topological defects in such a model will be evidently the pointlike domain walls . )",
    "as is known , the stable low - temperature vacuum states of the field  ( [ lagrangian ] ) are @xmath37 while a domain wall between them is described as @xmath38 $ ] and involves the energy @xmath39 ( from here on , it will be assumed that thickness of the wall @xmath40 is small in comparison with a characteristic domain size . )",
    "next , by introducing the conformal time @xmath41 , the space ",
    "time metric  ( [ metric ] ) can be reduced to the conformally flat form @xcite : @xmath42 \\ , ; \\ ] ] so that the light rays ( @xmath43 ) will be described by the straight lines inclined at @xmath44 : @xmath45 .",
    "the entire structure of the space  time can be conveniently presented by the conformal diagram in fig .",
    "[ conf_diag ] .",
    "let @xmath46 and @xmath47 be the beginning and end of the phase transition , respectively , and @xmath48 be the instant of observation .",
    "then , as follows from a simple geometric consideration , @xmath49 is the maximum correlation length ; so that @xmath50 is the minimum number of spatial subregions causally - disconnected _ during _ the phase transition .",
    "( their final vacuum states are arbitrarily marked by the arrows . )      a probability of phase transition without formation of the domain walls @xmath51 is commonly estimated as ratio of the number of field configurations without domain walls to their total number : @xmath52 which tends to zero very sharply at large @xmath53 .",
    "so , the observable part of the universe , represented by the large upper triangle in fig .  [ conf_diag ] , will inevitably contain a considerable number of the domain walls .    on the other hand , if a sufficiently long interval of the conformal time @xmath54 preceded the phase transition , then a coherent state of the higgs field ( shown by the lower shaded triangle ) will be formed by the instant @xmath46 in the entire region observable at @xmath48 .",
    "the inequality  ( [ coher_state ] ) can be satisfied , particularly , in the case of sufficiently long de sitter stage . really , if @xmath55 , then @xmath56 so that @xmath57 can be sufficiently large . from the viewpoint of elementary - particle physics , the de sitter stage can be easily realized in the overcooled state of higgs field just before its first - order phase transition .",
    "( let us remind that just this idea was the basis of the first inflationary models ; for more details , see review  @xcite . )",
    "next , if condition  ( [ coher_state ] ) is satisfied , it is reasonable to assume that the coherent state of the field @xmath34 will exhibit gibbs - like correlations ( similar to the ones occurring in a superconducting bose condensate of mjjl ) between the all @xmath53 subregions drawn in fig .",
    "[ conf_diag ] .",
    "in such a case , the probability @xmath51 should be calculated taking into account the gibbs factors for the field configurations involving domain walls : @xmath58 where @xmath59 here , @xmath60 is the spin - like variable describing a sign of the vacuum state in the @xmath61th subregion , @xmath62 is the domain wall energy , given by  ( [ d - w_energy ] ) , and @xmath30 is the characteristic temperature of the phase transition .    from the mathematical point of view , statistical sum  ( [ stat_sum ] ) is very similar to the one for ising model , well studied in the condensed - matter physics ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using exactly the same methods ( attention should be paid to the appropriate choice of zero energy ) ,",
    "we get the final result : @xmath63}^n +    { \\left [ 1 - e^{- e / t } \\right]}^n } \\ ; . \\label{gibbs_probabil}\\ ] ] ( yet another method of calculating this quantity , based on explicit expressions for the probabilities of field configurations with various numbers of the domain walls , was presented in our article  @xcite . )    as is seen in fig .",
    "[ prob_distr ] , @xmath51 drops very sharply with increasing @xmath53 at small values of @xmath64 corresponds to the case when gibbs - like correlations between the subregions are absent at all , so that formula  ( [ gibbs_probabil ] ) coincides with  ( [ triv_probabil ] ) . ] but becomes a gently decreasing function of @xmath53 when the parameter @xmath64 is sufficiently large .",
    "therefore , _ just the large energy concentrated in the domain walls turns out to be the factor substantially suppressing the probability of their formation . _",
    "the probability of phase transition without formation of the domain walls  @xmath51 as function of the number of disconnected subregions  @xmath53 and the ratio of the domain wall energy to the phase transition temperature  @xmath64 .",
    ", width=283 ]    as can be easily derived from  ( [ gibbs_probabil ] ) , the probability of absence of the domain walls in the observable region of space  time becomes on the order of unity ( for example , @xmath65 ) if @xmath66 or , by substituting ( [ d - w_energy ] ) and ( [ num_subreg ] ) , @xmath67 which is just the required inequality , mentioned in introduction .",
    "because of the very weak logarithmic dependence in the right - hand side of  ( [ d - w_absence ] ) , this condition may be quite reasonable for a certain class of field theories .    moreover , the situation should be even more favorable in the cases of higher spatial dimensions .",
    "a well - known property of ising models in 2 and 3 dimensions is the tendency for aggregation of the domains with the same sign of the order parameter when the temperature drops below some critical value ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the condensed - matter applications",
    ", this corresponds to the spontaneous magnetization of a solid body . regarding the cosmological context",
    ", we can expect that probability of formation of the domain walls will be reduced dramatically at the sufficiently large values of @xmath64 . bears no relation to the phase transition in ising model .",
    "] this subject will be discussed in more detail in a separate paper  @xcite .",
    "although the model under consideration requires a presence of inflationary stage ( for the coherent state of higgs field to be formed ) can be satisfied much more easily if the phase transition develops from a strongly overcooled state of the higgs field . ] ) , it is not equivalent to the traditional inflationary models , where decrease in concentration of the _ previously formed _",
    "topological defects is a purely geometrical effect , associated with sharp expansion of the space .",
    "this raises a problem of _ new _ topological defects that can be formed at a _",
    "subsequent stage _ of decay of the inflaton field by itself . on the other hand , the inflationary stage in our model results in _ suppressing formation _ of the defects ( rather than subsequent decrease in their concentration ) . from this point of view , it represents a self - consistent solution of the problem .",
