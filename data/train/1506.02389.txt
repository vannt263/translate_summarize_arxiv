    "an _ involutory quandle _ is an algebraic structure @xmath0 satisfying the following identities : @xmath1 various other names have been used in literature : _ kei _ by takasaki ( and ocassionally later ) @xcite , _ symmetric sets _ by nobusawa and his followers @xcite , _ symmetric groupoids _ by pierce @xcite , _ left symmetric left distributive idempotent groupoids _ by the prague algebraic group @xcite .",
    "an _ involution _ ( or involutory mapping ) is a permutation @xmath2 such that @xmath3 .",
    "given a binary algebraic structure @xmath0 , consider the left translations @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "then @xmath0 is an involutory quandle if and only if it is idempotent and all left translations are involutory automorphisms . if we only assumed that left translations were automorphisms ( regardless their order ) , we would have obtained the class of _",
    "quandles_. many results presented here have a generalization into the class of all quandles .",
    "our goal is not a compact exposition of the theory of involutory quandles .",
    "rather , we want to tell the story of how the investigations of involutory quandles have been conducted .",
    "therefore , the primary ordering of the material is time . in section 2 ,",
    "we present three main motivations to study involutory quandles . in section 3 ,",
    "we overview most ( ? ) of the papers published on involutory quandles in 20th century . in section 4",
    ", we briefly mention how to study connected involutory quandles using a homogeneous representation and the canonical correspondence to transitive groups developed in @xcite , and show some enumeration results .",
    "the text is nearly self - contained , although familiarity with the basics of quandle theory , as described e.g. in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 2,3 ) or in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1 ) , would improve reader s understanding .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath7 be the ( left ) _ multiplication group _ and the _ displacement group _ of a quandle @xmath8 , respectively ( aka inner group and transvection group , resp . ) .",
    "a quandle @xmath8 is called _ connected _ if @xmath9 ( or , equivalently , @xmath10 ) acts transitively on @xmath8 .",
    "it is called _ faithful _ ( aka effective ) if all left translations are pairwise different .",
    "it is called _ latin _ ( aka a quasigroup ) if all right translations are permutations , too .",
    "it is called _ medial _ ( aka abelian or entropic ) if it satisfies the identity @xmath11 .",
    "in a euclidean space , let @xmath12 denote the reflection of @xmath13 over @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting algebraic structure is an involutory quandle .",
    "this observation , and the resulting abstraction of the notion of a reflection , can be attributed to takasaki and his remote 1942 work @xcite , but the real advances have been made by loos and others two decades later @xcite .",
    "symmetric spaces _ can be defined as differentiable manifolds equipped with a smooth involutory quandle operation such that , for any point @xmath14 , there is a neighborhood @xmath15 of @xmath14 such that @xmath14 is the only fixed point of the left translation @xmath16 on @xmath15 .    on any manifold with a metric ,",
    "define a symmetric space by @xmath17 to be the image of @xmath18 by the symmetry through @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , on the real line @xmath20 , on the @xmath21-sphere @xmath22 .",
    "the 3-sphere gives a reason why the fixed point condition is defined only locally : the point symmetric to the south pole through the north pole is the south pole , hence the uniqueness condition fails .",
    "another example of a symmetric space is the set of all @xmath23 positive definite symmetric matrices over the reals with the operation @xmath24 .",
    "grassman manifolds and jordan algebras are also symmetric spaces . any involutory quandle can be considered as a discrete symmetric space .    an interesting perspective on symmetric spaces is explained in @xcite .",
    "another class of geometric examples of involutory quandles , releated to homotopy classes on spheres , is discussed in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 be a group , or , more generally , a bol loop ( i.e. a `` non - associative group '' where associativity is replaced by a weaker law @xmath26 ) . the binary algebra @xmath27 with @xmath28 is an involutory quandle , called the _",
    "core _ of @xmath25 .",
    "cores were introduced by bruck who studied isotopy invariants of loops .",
    "he proved that isotopic moufang loops have isomorphic cores @xcite .",
    "cores were later picked up by belousov and others to construct some of the first examples of latin quandles , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter ix ) .",
    "cores were also investigated on its own .",
    "the equational theory of involutory quandles is that of the group cores @xcite .",
    "the core of a group is    * right distributive iff the group satisfies the identity @xmath29 @xcite . *",
    "medial iff the group is 2-nilpotent ( an unpublished result by roszkowska ) .",
    "* faithful iff the center of the group does not contain an involution @xcite .",
    "* latin iff the group is uniquely 2-divisible ( i.e. the mapping @xmath30 is a permutation ) @xcite .",
    "if the center of @xmath31 is trivial , one can state stronger results @xcite : the displacement group can be embedded into the product of @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are the groups generated by the left and right translations of @xmath31 , respectively , it consists of all @xmath34 such that @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( here @xmath37 denotes the derived subgroup ) , and if @xmath38 is the orbit of @xmath10 containing the unit , then @xmath38 is a normal subgroup of @xmath31 and @xmath39 is an elementary abelian subgroup of exponent 2 . consequently , if @xmath40 , then @xmath10 is isomorphic to @xmath41 .",
    "more about cores of bol loops can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter ix ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section iii.8 ) .",
    "some variations on the core construction are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the following construction is due to joyce @xcite and matveev @xcite .",
    "let @xmath42 be a tame knot and consider its diagram .",
    "it divides the knot to arcs ( segments from one underpass through some overpasses to the next underpass ) , let @xmath43 denote the set of arcs .",
    "the _ involutory knot quandle _ is the involutory quandle generated by @xmath43 subject to the relations @xmath44 for every crossing with the bridge @xmath14 and the underpassing arcs @xmath45 ( note that the position of @xmath45 plays no role since @xmath44 iff @xmath46 ) .",
    "the _ knot quandle _ is a richer structure , taking into account an orientation : the definition is analogous , requiring additionally that @xmath13 is the right underpass and @xmath47 is the left underpass .",
    "joyce and matveev , independently , proved that the knot quandle is a complete invariant with respect to ambient isotopy ( up to mirroring ) ; in particular , the knot quandle does not depend on the diagram .",
    "the involutory knot quandle is an incomplete invariant , nevertheless winker @xcite proved that it distinguishes the unknot ( i.e. non - trivial knots have non - trivial involutory quandles ) .",
    "the trefoil quandle is presented by @xmath48 and the figure - eight quandle is presented by @xmath49 it is easy to calculate that the involutory quandle of the trefoil is the core of the group @xmath50 , while for the figure - eight it is the core of @xmath51 .",
    "inspired by loos , nobusawa started a purely algebraic study of involutory quandles in the 1970s .",
    "he used the name _ symmetric set _ with the following definition : it is a mapping @xmath52 from a set @xmath43 into the set of involutions over @xmath43 , sending an element @xmath14 onto an involution @xmath53 such that @xmath54 and @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .",
    "then @xmath57 is an involutory quandle operation on @xmath43 , and every symmetric set results from an involutory quandle as the mapping @xmath58 .    in his first article @xcite ,",
    "nobusawa formulated some of the fundamentals of the structure theory of involutory quandles .",
    "he demonstrated that the displacement group reflects a lot of properties of the quandle .",
    "for example , an involutory quandle @xmath8 is medial if and only if the group @xmath10 is abelian . if @xmath8 is faithful , then it is medial if and only if @xmath59 for a fixed @xmath60 , and in such a case , @xmath8 is latin ( called homogeneous there ) . fix @xmath60 and define the power of an element @xmath14 by @xmath61 in this way , _",
    "cycles _ are defined ( in other terms , cycles are homomorphic images of the core of the group of integers in @xmath8 ) , and their properties investigated ( a somewhat clearer account on cycles can be found in ( * ? ? ? * section iii.5 ) ) .",
    "a finite involutory quandle is latin if and only if all cycles have odd length .",
    "latin involutory quandles with prime and prime square elements are cores of abelian groups , but there is a latin involutory quandle with 27 elements which is not the core of a group .",
    "the last page contains a list of all involutory quandles with at most five elements ( two of them are isomorphic , as pointed out to me by vanurov ) .    in the sequels @xcite , nobusawa and his collaborators concentrated mainly on the structure of simple involutory quandles .",
    "the exceptions are @xcite on the structure of latin involutory quandles ( see below ) , @xcite on a close connection between nilpotence and solvability of a quandle and of its displacement group , @xcite on quandles which do not embed into conjugation quandles , and @xcite showing an analogy to the group - theoretical jordan - hlder theorem .",
    "( in @xcite , nobusawa already considers general quandles , not necessarily involutory . )      a big portion of structure theory was developed by pierce in @xcite .",
    "both papers are very comprehensive and we will not try to survey the contents here .",
    "the fundamental idea is a correspondence between involutory quandles and groups generated by involutions , via the conjugation representation using the subquandle @xmath62 of a group @xmath31 ( i.e. the operation on @xmath8 is @xmath63 ) .",
    "perhaps most importantly , pierce obtains an orbit decomposition theorem for involutory quandles in terms of his group representation . among other results",
    ", he describes free involutory quandles , investigates properties of cycles , and develops a graph theoretical method to study _ balanced _ involutory quandles ( satisfying @xmath64 iff @xmath65 ; for example , cores are balanced ) .      in @xcite ,",
    "nobusawa points out that the displacement group of a simple involutory quandle @xmath8 is a minimal normal subgroup of @xmath9 , hence , it is either simple , or a direct product of two simple groups which are conjugate .",
    "moreover , in the latter case , @xmath66 and @xmath9 is primitive ( primitivity has been shown later in @xcite ) .",
    "the article concludes with an application towards the structure of symmetric groups .    in the next paper @xcite ,",
    "ikeda and nobusawa investigate certain subquandles of the core of the groups @xmath67 and calculate their displacement groups .",
    "they also show that the core of @xmath68 is connected if and only if @xmath69 or @xmath21 is odd ; else , it consists of two orbits .",
    "nobusawa s next paper , @xcite , is concerned with the following construction which often results in a simple involutory quandle .",
    "let @xmath70 be a vector space over a field @xmath71 of characteristic @xmath72 , and let @xmath73 be a non - degenerate symmetric bilinear form on @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath74 .",
    "for @xmath75 , let @xmath16 be the reflection in the hyperplane orthogonal to @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath76 be the set of all 1-dimensional subspaces of @xmath70 generated by an element of @xmath43 .",
    "then @xmath77 with @xmath78 is an involutory quandle .",
    "it is connected if there exist linearly independent vectors @xmath79 such that @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath9 is primitive if @xmath81 or if @xmath82 and @xmath83 .    in @xcite",
    ", nagao discusses involutory quandles with transitive or primitive multiplication groups .",
    "if @xmath9 is primitive , then @xmath8 is simple .",
    "if @xmath8 is simple , then @xmath9 is transitive ( i.e. @xmath8 is connected ) .",
    "if @xmath31 is a group generated by a set of involutions @xmath8 such that @xmath8 is a conjugacy class and the subgroup generated by @xmath84 is a minimal normal subgroup of @xmath31 , then the set @xmath8 with the operation @xmath63 is a simple involutory quandle .    in @xcite",
    ", nobusawa extends some of the results on involutory quandles to general quandles , and proves a few new ones .",
    "perhaps the most important fact is that a quandle @xmath8 is simple if and only if it is connected , faithful and @xmath10 is a minimal normal subgroup of @xmath9 .",
    "an application towards simplicity of groups ( via simplicity of their conjugation quandles ) is presented .",
    "continuing in this direction , in @xcite he obtains a new proof that orthogonal groups are simple .    the study of simple quandles culminated by joyce s classification @xcite , including an explicit statement which of them are involutory .",
    "the medial simple involutory quandles are the cores of simple abelian groups , and the non - medial ones are realized as a conjugacy class of involutions in a simple non - abelian group .",
    "a different description of simple quandles can be found in @xcite ( without an explicit reference to involutority ) .",
    "there are at least four independent sources of origin for latin involutory quandles .",
    "we briefly mention the main ideas and refer to the recent survey @xcite on latin quandles for a full account .",
    "as noted earlier , they are mentioned in the works of nobusawa and his followers . in @xcite , latin involutory quandles with prime and prime square elements",
    "are proved to be the cores of abelian groups .",
    "most notably , the paper @xcite by kano , nagao and nobusawa is fully concerned with latin involutory quandles . using a conjugation representation ( as in pierce s papers ) , and with the help of glauberman s @xmath85-theorem , they prove that a finite involutory quandle @xmath8 is latin if and only if the derived subgroup @xmath86 has odd order .",
    "they conclude that latin involutory quandles are solvable ( informally , they can be constructed by a chain of extensions by medial quasigroups ) , and satisfy analogies of the lagrange and sylow theorems .    independently , latin involutory quandles appeared in the studies of self - distributive quasigroups by belousov s group ( they called them left symmetric left distributive quasigroups @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , galkin s theory applies non - trivially to latin involutory quandles ( * ? ? ? * section 6 ) .",
    "galkin mentions the involutory case explicitly on two occasions . in @xcite",
    ", he shows that finite latin involutory quandles are solvable , and an infinite latin involutory quandle @xmath8 is solvable if and only if for every @xmath87 and every @xmath88 the mapping @xmath89 has a unique fixed point .",
    "this is not always the case , as e.g. in @xmath90 with @xmath91 where @xmath92 . in @xcite",
    ", galkin proves that every finite solvable latin quandle has the lagrange property , but not necessarily the sylow property . in @xcite",
    ", he proves the sylow property under the additional assumption that the size of the quandle , and the order of its translations , are coprime ; this is always true in the involutory case .",
    "another important fact is that there is a one - to - one correspondence between latin involutory quandles and uniquely 2-divisible bruck loops , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* setion 5 ) for a precise statement ( bruck loops are , in a sense ,  the abelian loops among the bol loops \" ; a deep theory of uniquely 2-divisible bruck loops has been developed in @xcite ) .",
    "this connection has a rich history .",
    "it was first realized by robinson in his 1964 phd thesis , but published only 15 years later in @xcite .",
    "independently , belousov and florya ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) noticed that latin involutory quandles are isotopic to bol loops , but they did not formulate the full correspondence . independently ,",
    "the correspondence was found by kikkawa @xcite and by nagy and strambach @xcite .",
    "note that commutative involutory quandles are latin .",
    "they are precisely the distributive steiner quasigroups , which correspond to combinatorial designs called _ hall triple systems _",
    "it was proved by bruck @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 8.5 ) ) that distributive steiner quasigroups ( i.e. commutative involutory quandles ) are precisely the cores of commutative moufang loops of exponent 3 .",
    "the primary examples of medial involutory quandles are the cores of abelian groups .",
    "a faithful involutory quandle is medial if and only if it is the core of an abelian group @xcite , but a plenty of other non - faithful examples exist , see @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7 ) .",
    "medial involutory quandles were studied extensively by roszkowska - lech @xcite under the name _ sie groupoids _",
    "( she was probably unaware of the quandle context of her subject ) .",
    "her main result is that medial involutory quandles can be assembled from pieces that are cores of abelian groups , linking the pieces together by a mesh of group homomorphisms @xcite .",
    "the construction was recently generalized to all medial quandles @xcite .",
    "she also described the lattice of subvarieties which is isomorphic to the lattice of integers under division with an additional top element @xcite , and classified subdirectly irreducible medial involutory quandles @xcite .",
    "the subject of @xcite is a special class of reductive medial involutory quandles .",
    "the results were also put into a broader context in ( * ? ? ? * section 6 ) .",
    "another special class , so called group related symmetric groupoids , was studied by endres in @xcite .      free involutory quandles are described in @xcite , an explicit normal form of terms is determined in @xcite .",
    "joyce in @xcite shows that the free involutory quandle with two generators is the core of the group of integers , and the free medial involutory quandle with @xmath21 generators is the subquandle of the core of the group @xmath93 generated by @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "it follows that the equational theory of medial involutory quandles is that of the cores abelian groups .",
    "niebrzydowski and przytycki @xcite studied free objects in the varieties of involutory quandles satisfying @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( the former identity is commutativity , hence they were partly reproving some older results on steiner quasigroups ) .      ",
    "non - idempotent quandles \" are referred to as _ racks_. the only project specifically addressing non - idempotent involutory racks i know about is the one carried out in our group in prague more than a decade ago . in @xcite ,",
    "my former adviser tom kepka suggested to study involutory racks ( in his terms , left symmetric left distributive groupoids ) , and stated a few initial observations on their structure and on the lattice of subvarieties .",
    "i picked up the proposal and it resulted in some of my earliest papers . in @xcite , we found a description of non - idempotent subdirectly irreducible involutory racks and obtained some enumeration results . in @xcite",
    ", i managed to generalize the subvariety observations into a broader context . in @xcite",
    ", i discussed several involutory rack operations on groups and derived normal forms for terms in several varieties of involutory racks and quandles .",
    "the whole project is summarized in @xcite .",
    "recall that an involutory quandle is called connected if @xmath9 is transitive on @xmath8 .",
    "the main result of @xcite is a canonical correspondence between connected quandles and certain configurations in transitive groups , called quandle envelopes .",
    "fix a set @xmath8 and an element @xmath60 .",
    "a quandle envelope is a pair @xmath98 such that @xmath31 is a transitive group on @xmath8 and @xmath99 such that @xmath100 .",
    "it is easy to see that an envelope @xmath98 corresponds to an involutory quandle if and only if @xmath101 is an involution .",
    "consequently , one can easily use all the techniques described in @xcite to study connected involutory quandles .",
    "for example , using their algorithm , one can enumerate connected and latin involutory quandles up to size 47 , see table [ tab : enum ] ."
