    "since the discovery of chirped pulse amplification @xcite the powers and intensities of state of the art laser facilities have been exponentially increasing @xcite , the current record of @xmath1 w @xmath2 having been set in 2008 @xcite . with the advent of various new facilities over the next few years , such as the vulcan 20 pw",
    "upgrade @xcite , the extreme light infrastructure ( eli ) facility @xcite and the xcels project @xcite , this trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future . the availability of such technology has driven a large field of research in the topic of nonlinear thomson and compton scattering , the understanding of which is important from a fundamental physics perspective @xcite .",
    "additionally , and at least as importantly , the process produces high - energy , tuneable @xmath3-ray beams , which are important for fundamental research @xcite , as well as more practical applications such as cancer radiotherapy @xcite and the radiography of dense objects @xcite .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have been pushing the limits of peak energies and brilliances , taking us towards the regime where radiation reaction and qed effects will start to come into play @xcite .",
    "( for related studies of high energy electrons in orientated crystals see , e.g. , @xcite . )    in this article we study nonlinear thomson and compton scattering at ultra high intensities , assessing the impact of classical radiation reaction and qed effects on the properties of the emitted photon spectra .",
    "we find that , because the classical theory overestimates the radiative energy loss , it predicts a broader angular spread of emissions than the qed theory .",
    "we consider the case of an electron in a head on collision with a laser pulse .",
    "we adopt natural units where @xmath4 . to begin with we will take our laser to be a plane wave field propagating in the @xmath5-direction described by the null wave vector @xmath6 , with central frequency @xmath7 .",
    "we assume the field to be polarised in the perpendicular ( @xmath8 ) direction and therefore introduce the polarisation vector @xmath9 .",
    "we define the dimensionless intensity in the usual manner , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the _ peak _ magnitude of the electrical field strength .",
    "the electromagnetic field tensor of the wave is taken to depend arbitrarily on the phase @xmath12 ; @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a function describing the pulse .",
    "additionally , to aid future discussion , we also define the time - dependent intensity @xmath16 , which is equal to @xmath17 at the pulse peak .",
    "the emission spectrum from a particle in the field can be decomposed into a sum of harmonics , corresponding to multiples of the laser frequency . in the quantum description",
    "these correspond to the number of laser photons involved in the scattering process @xcite . during each scattering process",
    ", the electron will absorb an integer number @xmath18 of laser photons ( each of momentum @xmath19 ) before emitting a photon of momentum @xmath20 . from conservation of momentum arguments",
    "it can be shown that the frequency of the scattered photon is given by @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 it can be seen that when @xmath23 the maximum emission frequency occurs when the photons are backscattered ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "conversely , when @xmath25 the maximum frequency occurs for forward scattering ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "note that the support for a given harmonic depends on the harmonic number @xmath18 ( and that the amplitude of a given harmonic will be determined by the cross sections provided in the references ) . for high intensities",
    "the spectrum will be composed of a very large number of harmonics , with the spectrum decaying after the harmonic with number @xmath27 @xcite .    , the peak emissions will be forward scattered relative to the laser axis .",

    "@xcite for further details .",
    "[ fig : centre_of_mass ] ]    now let us consider the angular directions of the emissions . from expressions ( [ nuprime ] ) and ( [ jn ] ) it can be seen that the angular range of each harmonic will depend on both @xmath17 and the @xmath3-factor of the electron .",
    "it can be shown that the angle at which the emissions peak depends on the ratio of the sum of the laser photon momenta to the electron momenta ( see @xcite for further details ) . in the case where momentum is greater than the sum of the laser photon momenta for all the photons involved in even the highest order scattering processes ,",
    "i.e. @xmath31 , the peak emissions will be forward scattered relative to the laser axis . in the opposite case ,",
    "@xmath30 they will be backscattered , and the case @xmath28 defines the ` center - of - mass ' frame for the collision ( see @xcite ) where the peak emissions will be at @xmath29 .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : centre_of_mass ] .",
    "when the background field is of high intensity the radiation emissions from the particle will be so strong that the resulting energy loss will begin to effect its motion @xcite .",
    "this radiation reaction ( rr ) effect will cause the @xmath3-factor of the particle to decrease during the interaction with the laser field .",
    "this will mean that in order to estimate the peak emission angle we must consider the value of the @xmath3-factor when the particle is in the peak of the laser field ( since the highest intensity region will produce the strongest emission signal strength and therefore dominate the total spectrum ) , rather than the initial value . in fig .",
    "[ fig : electron_energy ] where we show how the ratio of laser intensity to particle @xmath3-factor changes with time .",
    "if we wish to consider quantum effects then it is instructive to introduce the dimensionless and invariant ` quantum efficiency ' parameter , where @xmath32v@xmath33 is the qed ` critical ' field ( ` sauter - schwinger ' field )  @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as the work done on the electron by the laser field over the distance of a compton wavelength . in the regime @xmath34",
    "quantum effects , including pair production from the emitted photons , will dominate .",
    "for the purposes of this study we restrict ourselves to the regime where @xmath17 , @xmath35 , such that quantum effects play a role in the compton spectra , but have @xmath36 , so that pair production can be neglected .",
    "-factor of the particle decreases due to rr loses throughout its interaction with the laser pulse .",
    "the dynamics can be roughly divided into three regimes : ( i ) initially @xmath37 , ( ii ) as the particle approaches the peak field it loses energy due to rr , resulting in @xmath38 , ( iii ) after the peak field there will be a period where @xmath39.[fig : electron_energy ] ]",
    "to generate the emission spectra we use the single particle code simla @xcite , which runs in both classical and qed modes . in the classical case",
    "we propagate the particle through the fields using the landau lifshitz ( ll ) equation , which takes into accounts rr effects via the inclusion of some correctional terms to the lorentz force equation  @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the classical electron radius , and the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to proper time .",
    "we note that there are numerous alternative equations in the literature ( for an overview see refs .",
    "@xcite and for further discussions of the ll equation see refs .",
    "however , the ll equation has , along with some others , recently been shown to be consistent with qed to the order of the fine - structure constant @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the resulting classical emission spectra are calculated using a novel monte carlo method introduced in @xcite .",
    "the method is simple and computationally efficient .",
    "as the particles in our simulation are ultra - relativistic the radiation due to transverse acceleration is dominant , since this is a factor @xmath43 larger than that due to longitudinal acceleration @xcite . since the acceleration and velocity of the particle are perpendicular , we can approximate the radiation as synchrotron radiation . in our method",
    "we calculate the _ effective magnetic field _ , @xmath44 , acting on the particle over each timestep .",
    "this is the magnetic field which would cause the same acceleration as the electric and magnetic fields together .",
    "the typical frequency of synchrotron emission is then given by @xmath45 .",
    "for an ultra - relativistic particle in an external , homogenous magnetic field , is the first synchrotron function . at each timestep",
    "the quantity @xmath46 is calculated and a monte - carlo method is used to sample from the spectra .",
    "the direction of the emission is taken to be that of the particle velocity , a good approximation for the ultra - relativistic case @xcite .    in the qed case",
    "our code works as follows .",

    "although @xmath52 diverges at small @xmath53 , the total rate of photon emission @xmath54 , given by integrating ( [ constantfieldrate ] ) over all @xmath55 $ ] , is finite .",
    "( this apparent softening of the usual infra - red divergence in qed is explained in  @xcite . )    in the qed simulations the electron is propagated along a classical trajectory divided into discrete time steps .",
    "after each step @xmath56 the code calls a statistical subroutine to calculate the probability of photon emission and to correct the electron s momentum .",
    "the routine generates a uniform random number @xmath57 $ ] and , if the condition @xmath58 is satisfied , an emission is deemed to occur ( under the requirement @xmath59 ) .",
    "note that @xmath60 ( and @xmath61 ) are time - dependent quantities , due to the temporal variation of both the laser pulse and the electron motion .",
    "if an emission event occurs , a second uniform random number @xmath62 $ ] is generated and the photon s @xmath53 ( and hence its frequency ) is calculated as the root of the sampling equation the photon momentum is then determined by @xmath63 together with the assumption that at high @xmath3 the photon is emitted in the direction of the electron s motion , just as in the classical method described above .",
    "finally , the momentum of the photon is subtracted from the momentum of the electron , i.e.   the electron is recoiled , imposing the conservation law @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "the simulation then proceeds by propagating the electron ( via the lorentz equation ) and the photon ( on a linear trajectory ) to the next time step . in this way ,",
    "multiple emissions are described as sequential single photon emissions , as in ( [ constantfieldrate ] ) , occurring at discrete time intervals ( for further information on the multi - photon calculation see ref .",

    "it can be seen clearly that the classical expressions overestimate the energy loss of the particle .",
    "the reason for this can be understood from the fact that the qed electron only emits at discrete times , allowing it to penetrate deeper into the laser pulse before it loses energy from an emission , whereas the classical electron is radiating and losing energy continuously @xcite .",
    "this means that , as the classical particle propagates through the pulse , its energy is going to be correspondingly lower than its qed counterpart . from fig .",
