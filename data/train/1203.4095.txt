    "only distinction lies in the way how the driving force is exerted , i.e. , unlike the end - pulling for the dragged chain ( eq .  ( [ f_rouse_steady ] ) ) , the force is acting only on the segment inside the pore which is fixed in space . since the polymer exhibits a biased brownian motion , the segment under the action of the driving force changes with time .",
    "this makes a trouble in the implementation of the force term in rouse model , and also causes some subtlety in the description of the moving domain in the scaling approach  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the basic physics can be well captured by the two - phase formalism , which can be developed along the same line with the present problem .",
