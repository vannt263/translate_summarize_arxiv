    "the detection of the early time multi - wavelength radiation from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) within the first day after the initial flash of @xmath0-rays is essential for refining our understanding of these energetic events .",
    "the internal - external shock scenario @xcite suggests that along with the forward shock , which propagates into the circumburst medium to generate the classical afterglow , there is also emission associated with the reverse shock propagating into the relativistic ejecta @xcite .",
    "evidence for the presence of a reverse shock has been demonstrated by the detection of optical flashes ( within minutes after the @xmath0-ray trigger ) that are not correlated with the initial @xmath0-ray emission from the grb @xcite .",
    "such emission can only be explained by the presence of different physical emitting regions . this same model suggests that the detection of radio flares approximately 1 day post - burst also emanate from the reverse shock @xcite .",
    "such early time radio signals , which imply a rapid rise and fall in emission within 1 day post - burst , are atypical when compared to the classical radio afterglow of long grbs resulting from the forward shock , which slowly evolve on the time - scales of days to years ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "the early time radio signature of grbs has not been as well investigated as it has in the optical band .",
    "this is due to the limited number of large radio telescopes , which are required for such follow - up observations due to the faintness of grb radio emission .",
    "this in turn makes it more difficult to acquire target - of - opportunity observations at the time of the event .",
    "early time observations have traditionally required human intervention to activate , potentially resulting in the first radio observation of a given grb being delayed several hours to even days post burst . as a result the radio emission emanating from the reverse shock of a grb has only been observed in a few cases where the earliest radio detections have occurred around @xmath2 day post - burst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "more recently @xcite conducted a robotized follow - up experiment using a 12  m radio dish at 1.4  ghz that was specifically designed to search for prompt radio emission associated with grbs .",

    "this rapid grb follow - up programme conducted with ami is fully automated and is activated when  triggers on an event , with response times as low as 5 minutes @xcite .",
    "this programme is therefore capable of statistically constraining the radio properties of many  detected grbs ( both long and short ) within the first hour post - burst , which has never been done before .",

    "the extreme brightness and very early detection of an optical counterpart spurred a rapid succession of multi - wavelength follow - up observations making grb 130427a one of the best spectrally and temporally sampled grbs to date @xcite .",
    "broadband modelling conducted by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , using multi - wavelength observations ranging from 1 ghz to 0.1 tev conducted between 300s and 60 days post - burst , revealed that the emission from grb 130427a is best described by synchrotron emission from the combination of a reverse and forward shock .",
    "extremely early optical observations conducted with raptor ( rapid telescopes for optical response ) also detected a peak in optical emission @xmath7s post - burst @xcite .",
    "this optical flash was temporally coincident with grb 130427a s prompt @xmath0-ray emission but modelling by @xcite demonstrated that it is more likely generated by the grb s reverse - shock .",

    "if we assume that the emission from grb 130427a is a non - relativistic flow that emanates from a region of size @xmath41 then a brightness temperature of @xmath42  k is calculated from the first ami observation using @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the distance to the grb in cm , @xmath45 the flux in jy , @xmath46 is the observing frequency in hz , @xmath47 is time in seconds since the @xmath0-ray trigger , and @xmath48 the redshift @xcite .",

    "investigations by @xcite determined that the transition frequency between weak and strong scattering at the galactic latitude of grb 130427a is about 5 ghz , which places the ami observing frequency in the weak scattering regime where the modulation index is only a few percent ; scintillation is therefore unlikely to be the cause of the peak feature in the ami light curve .",

    "this fit overestimates the measured ami flux at 0.36 days by a factor of 2.4 , which is equivalent to @xmath59 standard deviations .",
    "as explained in section 2 this is well outside the flux attenuation that we might expect to have occurred during this observation .",
    "we therefore confirm that the increase in 15.7 ghz flux @xmath60 days post - burst is a real feature .",
    "we next fit a double broken power law to all the data points in the ami light curve .",

    "the ami light curve of grb 130427a is also clearly declining at @xmath19 days post - burst , which is consistent with the radio light curves of grb 990123 , grb 991216 , and grb 020405 , and therefore with a reverse shock interpretation .",
    "broadband spectral modelling of grb 130427a , which utilises observations from ghz radio wavelengths to gev @xmath0-ray energies , has revealed that the grb afterglow emission is best described by a two component synchrotron shock model , which is highly suggestive of the standard forward / reverse shock interpretation @xcite . in this picture",
    "the forward shock causes the emission at optical and x - ray frequencies after @xmath68  days , and the radio emission after a few weeks , while the earlier emission at those frequencies is dominated by the reverse shock .",
    "emission from the forward shock may also extend into the high - energy @xmath0-ray regime , but this requires changes in the models of particle acceleration up to these very high energies @xcite .",

    "<S> we present one of the best sampled early time light curves of a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) at radio wavelengths . using the arcminute mircrokelvin imager ( ami ) we observed grb 130427a at the central frequency of 15.7 ghz between 0.36 and 59.32 days post - burst . </S>",
    "<S> these results yield one of the earliest radio detections of a grb and demonstrate a clear rise in flux less than one day after the @xmath0-ray trigger followed by a rapid decline . </S>",
    "<S> this early time radio emission probably originates in the grb reverse shock so our ami light curve reveals the first ever confirmed detection of a reverse shock peak in the radio domain . at later times ( about @xmath1 days post - burst ) the rate of decline decreases , indicating that the forward shock component has begun to dominate the light - curve . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons of the ami light curve with modelling conducted by perley et al . </S>",
    "<S> show that the most likely explanation of the early time 15.7 ghz peak is caused by the self - absorption turn - over frequency , rather than the peak frequency , of the reverse shock moving through the observing bands .    </S>",
