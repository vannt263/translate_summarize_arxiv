    "the generation of quantum states is a prerequisite for universal quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite .",
    "quantum states are usually classified into discrete - variable ( dv ) and continuous - variable ( cv ) descriptions 2 . in the cv quantum regime",
    ", there are two classes of quantum states that play an important role in qip : gaussian and non - gaussian states , referring to their character of wave function or wigner function @xcite . in general ,",
    "gaussian states are relatively easy to generate and manipulate using current standard optical technology@xcite .",
    "however , in the recent several decades , some probabilistic schemes are proposed to generate and manipulate non - gaussian states @xcite .",
    "many schemes work in postselection @xcite , that is , the generated state is accepted conditionally on a measurement outcome .",
    "the typical examples include photon addition and subtraction @xcite , and noise addition @xcite . among them , an interesting scheme was based on the quantum - scissors devices . in 1998 , pegg , phillips and barnett proposed this quantum state truncation scheme , which change an optical state @xmath0 into qubit optical state @xmath1 .",
    "the device is then called a quantum scissors device ( qsd ) , while the effect is referred to as optical state truncation via projection synthesis .",
    "this quantum mechanical phenomenon was actually a nonlocal effect relying on entanglement because no light from the input mode can reach the output mode @xcite .",
    "after its proposal , an experiment of quantum scissors was realized by babichev , ries and lvovsky @xcite by applying the experimentally feasible proposal of ref .",
    "the qsd was also applied and generalized to generate not only qubits but also qutrits @xcite and qudits 11c1,11c2 of any dimension .",
    "similar quantum state can be also generated via a four - wave mixing process in a cavity @xcite .",
    "following these works on qsd , ferreyrol et al .",
    "implemented a nondeterministic optical noiseless amplifier for a coherent state @xcite .",
    "moreover , heralded noiseless linear amplifications were designed and realized @xcite .",
    "recently , an experimental demonstration of a practical nondeterministic quantum optical amplification scheme was presented to achieve amplification of known sets of coherent states with high fidelity @xcite . by the way",
    ", many systems transmitting signals using quantum states could benefit from amplification .",
    "in fact , any attempt to amplify signal must introduce noise inevitably .",
    "in other words , perfect deterministic amplification of an unknown quantum signal is impossible .",
    "in addition , miranowicz et .",
    "al . studied the phase - space interference of quantum states optically truncated by qsd @xcite .",
    "inspired by the above works , we generate a non - gaussian mixed state by using a gaussian thermal state as the input state of the quantum scissors in this paper .",
    "this process transform an input thermal state into an incoherent mixture of only zero - photon and single - photon components .",
    "the success probability of such event is studied .",
    "some properties of the generated state , such as signal amplification , signal - to - noise ratio and the negativity of the wigner function , are investigated in detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we outline the framework of qsd and introduce the scheme of thermal state truncation .",
    "quantum state is derived explicitly and the probability is discussed .",
    "subsequently , some statistical properties , such as average photon number , intensity gain , signal - to - noise ratio , are investigated in section iii .",
    "in addition , we study the wigner function and the parity for the output state in section iv .",
    "conclusions are summarized in the final section .",
    "in this section , we outline the basic framework of quantum scissors device and introduce our scheme of thermal state truncation .",
    "qsd mainly includes two beam splitters ( bss ) and three channels , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "three channels are described by the optical modes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 in terms of their respective creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath5(@xmath6 ) , @xmath7(@xmath3 ) and @xmath8(@xmath4 ) .",
    "since every channel have an input port and an output port , the qsd have six ports .",
    "the interaction including several key stages as follows .",
    "firstly , the channel @xmath2 and the channel @xmath4  are correlated through an asymmetrical beam splitter ( a - bs ) , whose operation can be described by the unitary operator @xmath9 with the transmissivity @xmath10 .",
    "after that , the channel @xmath3 and the channel @xmath4  are then correlated through another symmetrical beam splitter ( s - bs , also 50:50 bs ) , whose operation can be described by the unitary operator @xmath11 . moreover , among these six ports , four ports are fixed with special processes as follows : ( 1 ) injecting the auxiliary single - photon @xmath12 in the input port of channel @xmath2 ; ( 2 ) injecting the auxiliary zero - photon @xmath13 in the input port of channel @xmath4 ; ( 3 ) detecting the single - photon @xmath12 in the output port of channel @xmath3 ; and ( 4 ) detecting the zero - photon @xmath14 in the output port of channel @xmath4 .",
    "qsd leaves only one input port ( i.e. , the input port in channel @xmath3 ) and one output port ( i.e. , the output port in channel @xmath2 ) . injecting an appropriate input state in the input port",
    ", one can generate a new quantum state in the output port .",
    "many previous theoretical and experimental schemes have used the pure states as the input states to generated quantum states . here , our proposed scheme use a mixed state as the input state to generate quantum state .",
    "using a mixed state ( i.e. , thermal state ) as the input state , we shall generate another mixed state in our present protocol .",
    "the input thermal state is given by@xmath15where @xmath16  is the average number of the thermal photons @xcite .",
    "therefore , the output generated state can be expressed as@xmath17\\}b_{2}^{\\dag } \\left\\vert 1_{b}\\right\\rangle \\left\\vert 0_{c}\\right\\rangle \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath18 is the success probability .",
    "[ fig1 ]   in channel @xmath2 and the auxiliary single - photon @xmath19 in channel @xmath4 generates an entangled state between the modes @xmath2 and @xmath4after passing through an asymmetrical beam splitter ( a - bs ) with the transmissivity @xmath20 . the input mode @xmath3 ( accompanied by the input thermal state @xmath21 ) is then combined with @xmath4 in a ( 50:50 ) symmetrical beam splitter ( s - bs ) .",
    "a successful heralded truncation ( accompanied by the output generated state @xmath22 ) in the output @xmath2 mode is flagged by a single - photon event in the output @xmath3 mode detection and no photons on the output @xmath4 mode detection.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the explicit density operator in eq.([2 ] ) can further be expressed as@xmath23where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are , respectively , the zero - photon distribution probability and the one - photon distribution probability .",
    "obviously , the output state is an incoherent mixture of a vacuum state @xmath26 and a one - photon state @xmath27 with certain ratio coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath29 . if @xmath30 , then @xmath31 ; while for @xmath32 , then @xmath33",
    ".    from another point of view , the output generated state in eq.([3 ] ) remains only the first two terms of the input thermal state in eq.([1 ] ) , which can also be considered as an truncation from the input thermal state .",
    "however , the corresponding coefficients of these terms are changed .",
    "moreover , the output generated state carry the information of the input thermal state because it also depend on the thermal parameter @xmath16 .",
    "since no light from the input port reaches the output port , this process also mark the nonlocal quantum effect of the operation for the quantum scissors .    from present protocol ,",
    "we easily obtain @xmath18 as follows @xmath34for a given @xmath16 , it can be shown that @xmath18 is a linear decreasing function of @xmath20 .    [ fig2 ]   has been fixed to 0 , 0.2 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.2.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig.2 , we plot @xmath18 as a function of @xmath20  for different @xmath16 .",

    "the results on the success probability provide a theoretical reference for experimental realization .",
    "by adjusting the interaction parameters , i.e. , the thermal parameter @xmath39 of the input state and the transmission parameter @xmath20 of the a - bs , one can obtain different output states with different figures of merits .",
    "some statistical properties , such as average photon number , intensity gain and signal - to - noise ratio , are studied in this section . as the reference",

    ".      signal - to - noise ratio ( abbreviated snr or s / n ) is a measure used in science and engineering that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise @xcite .",

    "it is found that a clear enhancement ( corresponding to its input thermal state ) can be seen for @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , although the snr of the input thermal state is always smaller than 1:1 , the snr higher than 1:1 for the output generated state can be found in larger @xmath20 @xmath71 .",
    "the negative wigner function is a witness of the nonclassicality of a quantum state @xcite . for a single - mode density operator @xmath72 , the wigner function in the coherent state representation @xmath73 can be expressed as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .",

    "as we all know , the thermal state is a gaussian state , whose wigner function have no negative region .",
    "however , our output generated states have lost the gaussian characters because of the non - gaussian forms of their wigner functions .  in addition , the wigner function will exhibit negative in some region satisfying the following condition @xmath80/\\left ( 4\\bar{n}t\\right ) $ ] . in fig.6",

    "in summary , we have applied the qsd of pegg , philips and barnett to truncate a thermal field to a completely mixed qubit state , i.e. , a mixture of the vacuum and single - photon state .",
