    "a very interesting feature of heavy ion collisions at intermediate energy is that provided the experimental set ups are identical , the ratio of isotope yields from two different reactions , 1 and 2 , @xmath0 exhibits an exponential relationship as a function of the isotope neutron number @xmath1 and proton number @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath3 this is called isoscaling and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are called isoscaling parameters .",
    "various theoretical models have been examined for at least an approximate emergence of this law .",
    "a grand canonical model for multifragmentation naturally leads to this law but it is also seen to emerge as an approximate formula from a canonical model @xcite , an expanding excited source model @xcite and even anti - symmetrised molecular dynamics calculations @xcite . in this note",
    "we investigate how well isoscaling is obeyed in the lattice gas model ( lgm ) .",
    "part of what we do has already been looked at in a recent publication @xcite but both our perspectives and the lessons we derive from our study are different .",
    "although highly schematic , lgm has been profitably utilised for investigating phase transition properties and many features of inclusive cross - sections .",
    "one might expect that isoscaling is a general feature , not depending upon finer details of models and hence should be seen in the lgm multifragmentation model .",
    "the advavantage of lgm is ( 1 ) it takes into account the interaction between nucleons , both coulomb and nuclear exactly ( although the nuclear interaction is very schematic ) ; ( 2 ) it takes into account excluded volume effects exactly and ( 3 ) decay of hot nuclei need not be considered as the cluster algorithm recognises only particle stable clusters .",
    "many other models can not handle the above three issues easily although there are other many virtues in these other models .",
    "the methods for calculating fragments in an isotopic spin dependent lgm have been described in many places ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the nearest neighbor bond between unlike particles @xmath6 is set at -5.33 mev ( to produce binding energy of 16 mev per particle ) ; and the bonds between like particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 are set at 0 . the justifications for these choices are explained in @xcite . coulomb energy between protons is included .",
    "these specifications are enough to allow one to calculate populations of all fragments given the lattice size , the mass and charge numbers of the dissociating system and the temperature .",
    "but for later purposes we need to estimate the value of symmetry energy implied in the model .",
    "the reason for this is the following .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 ( and also @xmath5 of eq.(1 ) ) depends upon the value of @xmath9 of the the dissociating systems in reactions 1 and 2 .",
    "moreover , it also depends upon the value of symmetry energy which adds a term @xmath10 to binding energy in the liquid - drop formula .",
    "indeed it is a standard practice to use a relation @xcite between @xmath4 and the symmetry energy coefficient @xmath11 , as : @xmath12.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is therefore imperative to estimate a value of @xmath11 implied in the lgm .",
    "we obtain ground state energies of a large number of nuclei by monte - carlo sampling at zero temperature . for a given nucleus with mass number @xmath13 and charge @xmath2 this ground state energy",
    "is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "let the value of the coulomb energy which is also available from this calculation be @xmath15 .",
    "since by choice the volume energy is @xmath16 mev we can try to deduce the value of surface energy coefficient @xmath17 and the symmetry energy coefficient @xmath11 by setting @xmath18 ideally the values of @xmath17 and @xmath11 should be the same for all nuclei .",
    "but because there is no good reason why @xmath14 should obey this parametrisation exactly , values of @xmath17 and @xmath11 deduced from the above relation will change from nucleus to nucleus .",
    "we can now try to get the `` best '' values by minimising the sum of the squares of the deviation .",
    "we chose isotopes of some arbitrarily chosen @xmath2 s .",
    "the fit with the best values of @xmath17 and @xmath11 is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the fit in fig.1 appears to be very good but some words of caution are needed .",
    "of the two constants we are trying to get , @xmath17 is by far the most important one ; @xmath19 dominates over @xmath10 which is a smaller perturbation .",
    "but it is @xmath10 which is presumed to be the deciding factor for isoscaling .",
    "what is left after subtracting the surface term can not be fitted by the parametrisation @xmath10 very accurately .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig.2 .",
    "what is reported here is similar to but not identical with the extraction of @xmath17 and @xmath11 in @xcite .",
    "however there the symmetry energy derived had a volume part ( like here ) but also a surface part .",
    "we have absorbed here all the effects of symmetry energy using a volume term only in order to test how well lgm calculations follow eq.(2 ) which is based on a volume symmetry energy .",
    "we will compare our calculations with two sets of data .",
    "we first consider @xmath20sn+@xmath20sn ( reaction 1 ) and @xmath21sn+@xmath21sn ( reaction 2 ) central collision data .",
    "experimental data are given in fig.1 of @xcite .",
    "isoscaling is seen to be well satisfied with a value of @xmath4= 0.361 . in fig.3 .",
    "we show calculated results for @xmath22 where this is the ratio of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; @xmath25 is the average multiplicity of the composite with @xmath1 neutrons and @xmath2 protons .",
    "the dissociating systems are taken to be @xmath13=168 , @xmath2=75 for reaction 1 and @xmath13=186 , @xmath2=75 for reaction 2 .",
    "these are the recommended values @xcite after allowing for losses like pre - equilibrium emissions etc .. the average multiplicity is calculated from 100,000 monte - carlo events .",
    "we try 10,000 switches between two events .",
    "metropolis algorithm is used .",
    "the slopes of the ratios of the average multiplicities should correspond to to the measured value of the slope of experimental @xmath26 ( fig.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "no basic calculation with the grand canonical model which computes the value of @xmath4 has been reported .",
    "canonical model calculations are quite successful @xcite .",
    "smm calculations before decay of hot primaries show isoscaling quite well with @xmath4=0.46 ; but after decay of primaries isoscaling is not obeyed to the same precision and the approximate @xmath4 value changes slightly to 0.44 @xcite .",
    "results from lgm with different lattice sizes ( n ) and at different temperatures ( t ) are shown in fig.3 .",
    "isoscaling is obeyed very well though it is not as good as in experimental data . in lgm",
    "there is no correction due to secondary decay .",
    "the clusters calculated are all particle stable .",
    "even though isoscaling is only approximately obeyed we deduce an average value of @xmath4 .",
    "it is about 0.20 for @xmath27 lattice and temperature 5 mev ( compared to 0.36 in experiment ) .",
    "a notable feature of fig.3 is that for @xmath2=1 , @xmath1 can be as high as 6 ( fig.3 shows results upto 5 ) ; @xmath2=1 and @xmath1=6 as a stable composite happens with the proton in the central cube and six neutrons at the six faces .",
    "the binding energy per particle for this `` nucleus '' is 5.33(6/7 ) .",
    "of course in the real world such a nucleus does not exist .",
    "we now examine how well eq.(2 ) is obeyed in lgm .",
    "we can write eq.(2 ) as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is just a property of the two dissociating systems and @xmath30 includes all the effects of symmetry energy .",
    "examining the validity of @xmath4 can be ambiguous in our case as isoscaling is not equally good for different @xmath2 s .",
    "fig.3 shows that @xmath2=2 obeys isoscaling quite well .",
    "let us limit ourselves to @xmath4 value for @xmath2=2 .",
    "we consider @xmath31=4 mev , lattice size @xmath27 , keep @xmath32 fixed at 75 , @xmath33 fixed at 168 . for @xmath34 fixed at 75 we vary @xmath35 from 168 to 186 and calculate @xmath4 as @xmath35 is varied . as a function of @xmath36 the value of @xmath4",
    "is quite linear ( fig.4 ) suggesting that the functional form of @xmath29 of eq.(2 ) is accurate for lgm .",
    "the same can not be said about @xmath37 .",
    "if we use eq.(2 ) , @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 mev as obtained from the least square fit in section ii , the predicted value of @xmath4 would be 0.86 ( as contrasted with @xmath41 as actually given by the lgm calculation ) . a different point of view",
    "is sometimes taken .",
    "one takes the value of @xmath4 and deduces the value of @xmath11 using eq.(2 ) . in our case from the value of @xmath42",
    "we would then be lead to believe that the value of @xmath11 is way lower , about 6 mev .",
    "we see no reason why a value of @xmath11 would so drastically change from about 23 mev for isolated nuclei to this low value at 4/5 mev temperature in an expanded volume in co - existence with other hot nuclei .",
    "it is specially hard to understand this in lgm .",
    "the composites in lgm can not be squished or expanded . at most",
    ", some of the composites may be in excited states with slightly different number of bonds .",
    "but such widely different value for symmetry energy appears unlikely .",
    "we remind the reader that there are two parts to the calculations .",
    "one is : given the lattice size , the number of neutrons and protons , the temperature and the bond strengths @xmath43 and @xmath44 , calculation of thermodynamic properties and many particle correlations at all levels .",
    "monte - carlo simulations solve this many - body problem of lgm correctly though numerically .",
    "next comes the question : how does one define clusters , given that the physics upto this point has been done correctly .",
    "we follow the prescription , first formulated for lgm in @xcite , subsequently reformulated with the same result in @xcite , shown to be closely equivalent to the one derived in @xcite and is now universally used . a practical , reasonable but different prescription",
    "is not known .",
    "given that the choice of the values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 is very restrictive , we have no freedom to alter anything .",
    "we find it easier to believe that the function @xmath37 as implied by eq.(2 ) is not correct for lgm .",
    "the other set of data we use is for @xmath45ni and @xmath46ni on @xmath47be .",
    "we assume that the much larger nucleus ni engulfs be so that for reaction 1 we have @xmath48 and for reaction 2 we have @xmath49 .",
    "experimental data can be found in @xcite .",
    "the subset of data we use here can also be found in @xcite ( figs.6 and 7 ) .",
    "experimental results for ni on be show a larger deviation from isoscaling compared to what is seen experimentally for sn on sn .",
    "fig.5 shows the results of our calculation .",
    "there are significant deviations from isoscaling . the calculated value of @xmath4 hovers around 0.22 ( these averages are always ambiguous since isoscaling deviations are more significant here ) whereas experimental values are around 0.6 .",
    "thus , as in the case of sn+sn , theory underestimates the value of @xmath4 .    in the case of ni on be , experimental values of @xmath26 are available for a large range of @xmath2 from 1 to 28 .",
    "low and moderate values of @xmath2 have an effective @xmath4 which is much smaller than those belonging to @xmath50 .",
    "( data can be found in @xcite . )",
    "such details do come out in lgm as well .",
    "we demonstrate this in fig.6 .",
    "this is highly satisfying .",
    "grand canonical model can not explain this difference although the canonical model model can and indeed fits the data very well @xcite .",
    "our first objective was to see if isoscaling is obtainable in lgm . it does appear that approximate isoscaling is obtained in the model .",
    "we confronted the calculations with two sets of experimental data .",
    "there are no free parameters in the model .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath4 are larger than what the model predicts , by about a factor of 2 .",
    "but the model does reproduce some remarkable features .",
    "it did show a significant increase in the value of @xmath4 going from low @xmath2 isotopes to high @xmath2 isotopes as seen in measurements .",
    "it also gave linearity of @xmath4 with @xmath51 .",
    "in view of the schematic nature of the model and obvious drawbacks , these successes are quite pleasing .",
    "underestimation of the value of @xmath4 remains a problem .",
    "we have checked that reasonable variations of lattice size or temperature will not correct this problem .",
    "moderate variations in the values of the bond strengths do not provide enough corrections .",
