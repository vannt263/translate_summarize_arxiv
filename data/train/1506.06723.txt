    "presently , there is an increasing interest of mathematical physics community in the spectral theory of non - self - adjoint differential operators .",

    "still , most of them give lieb - thirring type inequalities or upper bounds on certain distributional characteristics of eigenvalues , @xcite ( for an extensive reference list on the subject , see for instance the references given in @xcite ) .",
    "otherwise , results on spectral properties on non - self - adjoint operators can be found in the article by sjstrand @xcite and the references given there . in",
    "most of the above papers , the non - trivial question of the existence of complex eigenvalues near the essential spectrum is not treated and stays open .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , wang studied @xmath6 in @xmath7 , @xmath8 , where the potential @xmath9 is dissipative .",
    "that is , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are two measurable functions such that @xmath13 , and @xmath14 on an open non empty set .",
    "he showed that if the potential decays faster than @xmath15 , then the origin is not an accumulation point of the complex eigenvalues .",
    "for more general complex potentials without sign restriction on the imaginary part , it is still unknown whether the origin can be an accumulation point of complex eigenvalues or not . in this connection , the author @xcite proves the existence of complex eigenvalues near the landau levels together with their localization property for non - self - adjoint two - dimensional schrdinger operators with constant magnetic field .    motivated by wang s work @xcite , the current paper is devoted to the same type of results on eigenvalues near the landau levels for the three - dimensional schrdinger operator with constant magnetic field .",
    "now , the essential spectrum of the operator under consideration equals @xmath16 , and the landau levels play the role of thresholds .",
    "consequently , the situation is more complicated than the non - self - adjoint case of the two - dimensional schrdinger operator studied in @xcite , where the essential spectrum coincides with the ( discrete ) set of the landau levels .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath17 is generated by the magnetic potential @xmath18 .",
    "namely , @xmath19 with constant direction , where @xmath20 is a constant giving the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "then , the magnetic schrdinger operator is defined by @xmath21 in @xmath22 with @xmath23 . actually , @xmath24 is the self - adjoint operator associated with the closure @xmath25 of the quadratic form @xmath26 originally defined on @xmath27 .",

    "the point @xmath46 is said to be a discrete eigenvalue of @xmath44 if its algebraic multiplicity is finite and @xmath49    note that we have @xmath50 , the geometric multiplicity of @xmath46 .",

    "* theorem 1.5 ) ) that if @xmath56 satisfies @xmath57 for some constant @xmath58 and some non - empty open set @xmath59 , then the discrete spectrum of @xmath60 is infinite .",

    "* theorem 1.5 ) ) that @xmath60 has an infinite number of eigenvalues embedded in the essential spectrum . in the case",
    "where @xmath55 is axisymmetric verifying @xmath64 for some constant @xmath58 and some non - empty open set @xmath65 , it is also proved ( see @xcite ) that below each landau level @xmath66 , there is an infinite sequence of discrete eigenvalues of @xmath60 converging to @xmath3 . in @xcite ,",
    "the resonances of the operator @xmath60 near the landau levels have been investigated for self - adjoint potentials @xmath55 decaying exponentially in the direction of the magnetic field .",

    "then , from weyl s criterion on the invariance of the essential spectrum , it follows that @xmath77 however , the electric potential @xmath55 may generate ( complex ) discrete eigenvalues ( @xmath78 ) that can only accumulate to @xmath79 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.1 , p. 373 ) .",
    "a natural question is to sharpen the rate of this accumulation by studying the distribution of @xmath78 near @xmath80 , in particular near the spectral thresholds @xmath66 .",
    "motivated by this problem , the following result @xcite , often called a generalized lieb - thirring type inequality ( see lieb - thirring @xcite for original work ) , is obtained by using complex analysis tools developed by borichev - golinskii - kupin @xcite .",

    "thus , bound implies ( taking a subsequence if necessary ) , that @xmath96 formally , means that the sequence @xmath97 converges to the landau level with a rate convergence larger than @xmath98 .",
    "this means that the `` convergence exponent '' of such sequences near the landau levels is a monotone function of @xmath99 .",
    "however , even if theorem [ theo1 ] allows to estimate formally the rate accumulation of the complex eigenvalues ( near the landau levels ) , it does not prove their existence .",
    "two important points of the present paper are to be taken into account .",
    "first , we prove the presence of infinite number of complex eigenvalues of @xmath100 near each landau level @xmath3 , @xmath101 , for certain classes of potentials @xmath55 satisfying _ assumption ( a1)_. second , we prove that the landau levels are the only possible accumulation points of the discrete eigenvalues , see theorem [ theo6 ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we expect this to be a general phenomenon .",
    "our techniques are close to those from @xcite used for the study of the resonances near the landau levels for self - adjoint electric potentials .",
    "firstly , we obtain sharp upper bound on the number of discrete eigenvalues in small annulus around a landau level @xmath3 , @xmath102 , for general complex potentials @xmath55 satisfying _ assumption ( a1 ) _ ( see theorem [ theo2 ] ) . secondly , under appropriate assumption ( see _ assumption ( a2 ) _ given by ) , we obtain a special upper bound on the number of discrete eigenvalues outside a semi - axis in annulus centred at a landau level ( see theorem [ theo3 ] ) . under additional hypothesis ,",
    "( see _ assumption ( a3 ) _ given by ) , we establish corresponding lower bounds implying the existence of an infinite number of discrete eigenvalues or the absence of discrete eigenvalues in some sectors adjoining the landau levels @xmath3 , @xmath101 ( see theorem [ theo4 ] ) . in particular , we derive from theorem [ theo4 ] a criterion of non - accumulation of complex eigenvalues of @xmath60 near the landau levels , see corollary [ c1 ] ( see also conjecture [ cj2,1 ] )",
    ". loosely speaking , our methods can be viewed as a birman - schwinger principle applied to the non - self - adjoint perturbed operator @xmath100 ( see proposition [ prop3,2 ] ) . by this way",
    ", we reduce the study of the discrete eigenvalues near the essential spectrum , to the analysis of the zeros of a holomorphic regularized determinant .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
