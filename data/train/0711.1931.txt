    "although melting is a very common phenomenon in nature , the debate about its microscopic mechanism is still open.@xcite the first empirical theory was advanced by lindemann.@xcite according to this view , melting occurs when the ratio between the root mean square ( rms ) @xmath1 of the thermally activated lattice fluctuations and the lattice constant @xmath2 exceeds a phenomenological threshold @xmath3 which is roughly material independent @xcite . in spite of its several flaws ( melting is described in terms of the properties of only the solid phase ; no cooperative process and no role of defects are considered  ) , this simple criterion seems to work reasonably well for a variety of materials.@xcite lindemann criterion has been recently found to apply as well at a _",
    "level around crystal defects.@xcite this large range of validity of the lindemann criterion suggests thus that a microscopic mechanism is actually operative .",
    "the most simple ( and employed ) model to account for the lindemann phenomenology is the self - consistent harmonic approximation ( scha ) .",
    "this maps an anharmonic phonon model in a harmonic one .",
    "anharmonicity is , then , taken into account , at a mean - field level , through a debye - waller - like term which is evaluated self - consistently .",
    "the breakdown of this approach is interpreted as a signal of solid phase instability , and hence related to melting .",
    "one of the strength of this theory is that it predicts , in contrast with the born criterion but in agreement with the experimental observation , a partial but not total softening of the elastic constants of the bulk .",
    "the scha represents moreover an efficient tool to understand in a qualitative way the phenomenon of the surface melting ( sm ) , as first proposed by pietronero and tosatti ( pt).@xcite in this context , the physical mechanism underlying the surface melting is quite simple : atoms close to the surface have larger lattice fluctuations due to the reduced number of nearest neighbor sites , and the scha breaks down consequently at smaller temperatures than in the bulk .",
    "it is clear that this simple theory does not represent an exhaustive description of the surface melting phenomenology , which should include roughening , preroughening , partial wetting , the role of `` crystallinity '' etc.@xcite in addition it should be stressed that the scha does not determine directly the melting point but rather the instability of the solid phase which is prevented by the melting process itself.@xcite in this perspective this criterion should not be employed at a quantitative level .",
    "nevertheless , since the solid phase instability and the actual melting process are usually related to each other , the pt theory provides a simple and useful way to get information about the tendency of a system towards melting and surface melting and their dependence on microscopic parameters . in this paper",
    "we generalize the results of the pt approach in the case of quantum solids .",
    "the lindemann criterion in the quantum solid is shown to be twice as large as the one in the classical limit , in agreement with experimental reports.@xcite we show a phase diagram for both the bulk and surface melting cases and we investigate also the local melting due to an isotopic substitution . the temperature dependence of the lattice fluctuations for the different classical / quantum regimes is evaluated and also the profile of the lattice fluctuations as function of the distance from the surface or the isotopic impurities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",

    "this atom probes an effective harmonic potential smaller than the bulk , which increases its tendency towards melting .",
    "a numerical solution shows that the solid phase for the surface atoms becomes unstable at @xmath38 , 26 % smaller than the bulk value .",
    "the same theory permits to evaluate the profile of the lattice fluctuations as function of the distance from the surface .",
    "these theoretical predictions agree quite well with the profile of the lattice fluctuations close to defects ( grain boundaries , dislocations , vacancies ) in colloidal solids.@xcite note that , although the temperature of surface melting is smaller than in the bulk , local lattice fluctuations of the outer atoms can be _ larger _ than the ones in the bulk , violating locally the lindemann criterion .",

    "although these estimates have to be meant only indicative of the quantum degree of helium solid , they clearly point out that quantum anharmonic effects are large enough in solid helium , for these or larger molar volumes , to enforce surface melting and local melting close to quantum impurities _ down to zero temperature_. quantum monte carlo simulations have actually confirmed premelting at surface between helium solid and vycor walls @xcite and internal interfaces of a pure helium system @xcite , although not all possible interfaces undergoes a solid / liquid transition .",
