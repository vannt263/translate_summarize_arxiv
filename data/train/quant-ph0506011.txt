    "the symmetry of a quantum system determines the selection rules of its transitions .",
    "for instance , all states of a generic atom must have a well - defined parity , and one - photon absorption ( emission ) due to the electric - dipole interaction can only happen for non - degenerate states with opposite parities .",
    "for second - order processes , a two - photon transition requires that these states have the same parities . thus single- and two - photon transitions between two given energy levels can not coexist .",
    "most investigations so far have focused on either @xmath1 , or @xmath2 ( ladder ) , or @xmath3-type transitions  @xcite when studying three - level atomic systems .",
    "these notations , defined according to the transition configuration , are well known to physicists studying atoms and optics .",
    "for example , a @xmath4-type transition atom means that there are optical transitions from the top energy level to the two lower energy levels , respectively ; however , the optical transition between the two lower energy levels is forbidden .    the @xmath0-type three - level systems with cyclic transitions ( ct )  @xcite , in which one - photon and two photon processes coexist , are less common .",
    "it is of interest to explore the possibility of the coexistence of single photon and two photon processes . for chiral and other broken - symmetry systems",
    ", the lack of inversion center allows the ct to occur in realistic physical processes  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that such quantum systems can be experimentally implemented by left- and right - handed chiral molecules  @xcite .",
    "with ct , the populations of the different energy levels can be selectively transferred by controlling classical fields .    in an atomic system ,",
    "@xmath0-type transitions can also be formed  @xcite by applying three classical pulses : a pair of raman pulses and an additional detuning pulse .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that the physical mechanism of the cyclic stimulated raman adiabatic passage is not an adiabatic rotation of the dark state , but the rotation of a higher - order trapping state in a generalized adiabatic basis .",
    "most recently , the microwave control of the quantum states has been investigated for  artificial atoms \" made of superconducting three - junction flux qubit circuits  @xcite , which possess discrete energy levels .",
    "the optical selection rule of microwave - assisted transitions was analyzed  @xcite for this artificial atom .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that the microwave assisted transitions can appear for any two different states when the bias magnetic flux is near the optimal point but not equal to @xmath5 ( the value of the optimal point is @xmath5 ) .",
    "this is because the center of inversion symmetry of the potential energy of the artificial atom is broken when the bias is not equal to @xmath5 .",
    "then , so - called @xmath6-type or cyclic transition can be formed for the lowest three energy levels .",
    "the @xmath0-type transitions can also be obtained from the model of the single - junction flux qubit  @xcite . in any @xmath7type artificial atom",
    ", the population can be cyclically transferred by adiabatically controlling both the amplitudes and phases of the applied microwave pulses .",
    "however , the population transfer in the @xmath8type artificial atom  @xcite requires that two classical fields induce the transitions from the top energy level to other two lower energy levels , and transitions between two lower energy levels should be forbidden .",
    "this condition can be easily satisfied in the usual atoms due to the electric - dipole transition rule and its well defined party .",
    "however , in artificial atoms , these two fields can also induce a transition between two lower energy levels when we study a @xmath1-type artificial atom  @xcite .",

    "we will explore the ct mechanism to create a single - mode photon state , or a _ macroscopic _ schredinger cat state which is the entangled state between a macroscopic quantum two level system ( macroscopic qubit ) and non - classical photon states .",
    "our approach is robust because the working space is spanned by the ground state , or the two lowest energy levels , of the artificial atom . because the ground state is not easy to be excited by the environment in low temperature limit",
    "also our scheme is more controllable than either @xmath1 , or @xmath2 , or @xmath3-type atoms , since the extra coupling between the external field and the two lowest energy levels offers a new controllable parameter .",
