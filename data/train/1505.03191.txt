    "a hypothetical detection of r - mode gravitational radiation from newborn neutron stars could have at least three major implications in our understanding of neutron stars : ( i ) explanation of the low rotational frequencies of the observed neutron stars when compared to their possible rotational frequencies at birth , ( ii ) set constraints on the equation of state of the matter in the core of the neutron star and ( iii ) set upper bounds on @xmath0 and settle the debate about the magnitude of the saturation amplitude of the r - mode mass current oscillations on neutron stars .",
    "+ after some preliminaries in section 2 , the paper splits into two parts : the first part consists of sections 3 - 7 and the second part consists of sections 8 - 11 . in the first part we present the physics of a neutron star that can be derived from a hypothetical r - mode detection : ( i ) the moi of the neutron star , ( ii ) the eos of the matter in the neutron star nucleus and ( iii ) the saturation amplitude ( @xmath0 ) of the r - mode mass - current oscillations .",
    "these results constitute our motivation for the second part , to perform a sensitivity study on r - modes : using ( time - shifted ) eligo data , recolored with aligo and et sensitivity curves , we examine the distances at which our decision making algorithms can be sensitive to r - mode signals from newborn neutron stars with a false alarm rate ( far ) of @xmath4 and a false dismissal rate ( fdr ) of @xmath5 .",
    "+ the first part of the paper is organized as follows : in section 3 we discuss the power dependence on the gravitational - wave frequency and the saturation amplitude , @xmath0 , of the r - mode oscillations .",
    "this result is used in section 4 to argue that among all possible r - mode sources newborn neutron stars are the most promising sources of detectable r - mode gravitational waves . in section 5",
    ", we present the time frame after a supernova explosion in which we would expect to detect r - mode gravitational waves .",
    "we end the first part of the paper with sections 6 and 7 , where we present the motivation for a r - mode gravitational - wave search . in section 6",
    "we derive a relation between r - mode gravitational waves and the moi of the neutron star , while in section 7 we show how this relation is used to constrain the eos of the neutron star matter and subsequently set constraints on the saturation amplitude , @xmath0 , of neutron star r - mode oscillations .",
    "+ the second part of the paper is organized as follows : in sections 8 and 9 we discuss the choice of parameters used to construct the waveforms needed to design the sensitivity study . in section 8 we determine the range of possible values for the initial spindown frequency , @xmath6 , of the neutron star , while in section 9 we argue about the choice of the range of values for the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "these 2 parameters determine the waveforms used in the sensitivity study presented in sections 10 and 11 . in section 10 we present our choice of waveforms and plot several of them demonstrating the frequency spin - down dependence on @xmath0 and @xmath7 , while in section 11 we present the method of waveform injection and recovery as well as the results we obtained on the detection distances for each waveform that was used .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion on the results from our sensitivity study as well as suggestions for future work that will follow in a second paper .",
    "in the late 1990 s , the r - mode toroidal pulsations of a neutron star became very promising for generating strong gravitational - wave signals due to the chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz ( cfs ) instability they exhibit @xcite .",
    "r - modes of any harmonic , frequency and amplitude are subject to this instability at any angular velocity of the star @xcite . therefore , even the smallest toroidal perturbations in the velocity of the neutron star mass currents will keep increasing in amplitude . since the energy source of the r - mode oscillations is the rotational energy of the star",
    ", these small perturbations can eventually reach energy values of the order of the rotational energy of the neutron star .",
    "that would imply that all neutron stars are unstable and would contradict our observations .",
    "therefore , some r - mode damping mechanism must be active resulting in the r - mode oscillation reaching a saturation amplitude , thus preserving the stability of the neutron star .",
    "+ in considering the saturation amplitude , its normalization is such that values of order 1 carry energy of the same order of magnitude as the total rotational energy of the neutron star .",
    "some authors have introduced damping mechanisms that can cause saturation at r - mode oscillation amplitudes of order @xmath8 dimensionless units @xcite , while others have introduced mechanisms that cause saturation at amplitudes equal to or larger than @xmath1 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some studies have examined the hypothesis that , under certain conditions , r - mode oscillations may get suppressed when neutron star models with a solid crust are considered @xcite . in this case , the r - modes would be completely suppressed when the temperature of the neutron star drops below @xmath9{^ok}$ ] .",
    "however , we are interested in the very early stages in the life of a newborn neutron star , when its core temperature is still around @xmath10{^ok}$ ] .",
    "therefore , this solid - core suppression , if it exists , does not come into play until much later on in the evolution of the neutron star .",
    "the uncertainty exemplified in this situation calls for the design of a search for a r - mode gravitational radiation from newborn neutron stars to discover their saturation amplitudes .",
    "+ the bondarescu , teukolsky and wasserman 09 result was the outcome of numerous earlier studies e.g. @xcite that discovered a coupling between the r - mode and other inertial modes .",
    "bondarescu et al.s numerical study showed that for initial amplitudes of order @xmath11 , non - linear couplings of the r - mode with other ( neighboring in frequency ) inertial modes can result in saturation of the r - mode amplitude at values of order up to @xmath12 ( in their most optimistic case scenario ) .",
    "+ if the assumptions in the bondarescu et model do not hold and the r - mode does not saturate at their suggested amplitudes , a different mechanism may saturate the r - mode oscillations at higher amplitudes .",
    "such possibilities were considered by mark alford et al . , who worked on models where the r - mode oscillations can reach saturation amplitudes 2 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than those predicted by bondarescu et al .",
    "they explored mechanisms that can saturate the r - mode oscillations at amplitudes of order @xmath1 - @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "they discovered that non - linear bulk viscosity will cause r - modes to saturate at large amplitudes and spin down the neutron star in much shorter time scales than bondarescu et had suggested .",
    "in this section we present the expression for the r - mode waveforms that was derived in @xcite specifically for neutron star matter obeying a polytropic eos .",
    "we then derive the power dependence on the r - mode gravitational wave frequency , and the saturation amplitude @xmath0 .",
    "this is used in section 4 where we argue that newborn neutron stars are the most promising sources for r - mode gravitational waves .",
    "+      though very simplistic , the 98 model is still a very good approximation for the early stages of the neutron star spin - down @xcite .",
    "more complicated numerical methods have shown that a r - mode saturation amplitude @xmath14 can result in a spin - down whose energy loss can be detected as gravitational radiation by aligo @xcite . when this saturation amplitude is used in the 98 model , we see that there is a good agreement in the angular velocity evolution of the neutron star up to several months after the start of the neutron star spin - down . the evolution of the angular velocity @xmath15 of the neutron star in the owen et al .",

    "since the r - mode gravitational wave frequency , @xmath40 , is related to the neutron star rotational frequency , @xmath41 , by @xmath42 we conclude that r - mode gravitational waves from newborn neutron stars would have initial frequencies bounded above by @xmath43{hz}$ ] .",
    "+ estimating the value of the parameter @xmath0 is not as easy as estimating @xmath7 . during the decade following the 98 paper",
    "there was no known mechanism that could stop the r - mode amplitude from growing due to the cfs instability .",
    "therefore , the r - mode saturation amplitude was assumed to take values of order 1 .",
    "+ this is not the case in later simulations ( bondaresku , teukolsky , wasserman , 2009 ) where the r - mode oscillations exhibit non - linear couplings with daughter modes and the saturation amplitude ( @xmath0 ) reaches maximum values of order @xmath44 - @xmath12 .",
    "the models that predict these saturation amplitudes are discussed in section 9.1 .",
