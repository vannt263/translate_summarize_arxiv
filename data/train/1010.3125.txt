    "sensitivity to observation is an inherent feature of quantum mechanical systems whose state is affected by interaction with a macroscopic measuring device .",
    "this motivates the use of coherent quantum controllers to replace the classical observation - actuation control loop by a measurement - free feedback , which is organized as an interconnection of the quantum plant with another quantum system .",
    "if such a controller is implemented using quantum - optical components ( for example , optical cavities and beam splitters ) mediated by light fields @xcite , then it is dynamically equivalent to an open quantum harmonic oscillator , which constitutes a building block of quantum systems described by linear quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsdes ) @xcite .",
    "this leads to the notion of physical realizability which imposes quadratic constraints on the state - space matrices of the controller @xcite , thus complicating the solution of quantum control problems which are otherwise reduced to appropriate unconstrained problems for an equivalent classical system .",
    "the links between classical control problems and their quantum analogues are known , for example , for linear quadratic gaussian ( lqg ) and @xmath0-control .",
    "the coherent quantum lqg ( cqlqg ) problem seeks a physically realizable quantum controller to minimize the average output `` energy '' of the closed - loop system per unit time .",
    "this problem has been addressed in @xcite , where a numerical procedure was proposed for finding _ suboptimal _ controllers to ensure a given upper bound on the lqg cost .",
    "instead , the present paper focuses on necessary conditions for optimality and second order conditions for local strict optimality of a physically realizable controller and computation of the _ optimal _ controller .",
    "both approaches make use of the fact that the cqlqg problem is equivalent to a constrained lqg problem for a classical plant , with the lqg cost computed as the squared @xmath1-norm of the system in terms of the controllability and observability gramians satisfying algebraic lyapunov equations .    we utilize a hamiltonian parameterization that relates the state - space matrices of a physically realizable controller to the free hamiltonian , coupling and scattering operators of an open quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite . to obtain equations for the optimal quantum controller",
    ", we employ an algebraic approach , based on the frechet differentiation of the lqg cost with respect to the state - space matrices from @xcite and similar to @xcite .",
    "the resulting equations for the optimal controller involve the inverse of special self - adjoint operators on matrices that requires the use of vectorization @xcite .",
    "their spectral properties play an important role in the present study .",
    "although the optimal cqlqg controller does not inherit the control / filtering separation principle of the classical lqg control problem , a partial decoupling of equations for the gain matrices still holds .",
    "this _ quasi - separation _ property leads to a newton - like scheme for numerical computation of the quantum controller that involves the second order frechet derivative of the lqg cost which is related to the perturbation of solutions to algebraic lyapunov equations .",
