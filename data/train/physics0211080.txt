    "statistical properties of velocity field fluctuations recorded in wind tunnels and these obtained from solar wind observations exhibit striking similarities @xcite .",
    "a unifying feature found in these fluctuations is fractal or multi - fractal scaling .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) , unlike power spectra that do not reveal intermittency , show a clear departure from the normal distribution when we consider the difference in velocity on small spatial scales @xcite while large scale features appear to be uncorrelated and converge toward a gaussian distribution .",
    "these similarities suggest a common origin of the fluctuations in a turbulent fluid and the solar wind .",
    "the approach is then to treat the solar wind as an active highly nonlinear system with fluctuations arising in situ in a manner similar to that of hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite .",
    "kolmogorov s k41 turbulence theory was based on the hypothesis that the energy is transferred in the spectral domain at a constant rate through local interaction within the inertial range .",
    "this energy cascade is self - similar due to the lack of any characteristic spatial scale within the inertial range itself .",
    "these assumptions led kolmogorov to his scaling law for the moments of velocity structure functions @xcite : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the @xmath8-th moment , @xmath9 is a spatial scale and @xmath10 represents energy transfer rate .",
    "experimental results do not confirm this scaling , however , and modifications to the theory include intermittency @xcite by means of a randomly varying energy transfer rate @xmath10 . in this context",
    ", empirical models have been widely used to approximate the shapes of fluctuation pdfs of data from wind tunnels @xcite as well as the solar wind ; see for example @xcite .",
    "the picture of turbulence emerging from these models is much more complex then has been suggested by the original kolmogorov theory .",
    "it requires a multi - fractal phenomenology to be invoked as the self - similarity of the cascade is broken by the introduction of the intermittency .",
    "recently , however , a new approach has emerged where the presence of intermittency in the system coincides with statistical self - similarity , rather than multi - fractality , in the fluctuations of selected quantities ; these also exhibit leptokurtic pdfs .",
    "an example of this _ statistical intermittency _ was discussed in @xcite , where a lvy distribution was successfully fitted to the fluctuation pdfs of the price index over the entire range of data .",
    "such a distribution arises from the statistically self - similar lvy process also characterized by enhanced ( when compared with a gaussian ) probability of large events .",
    "recently @xcite reported similar self - similarity derived from the scaling of the solar wind interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) energy density fluctuations calculated from the wind spacecraft dataset .    here",
    ", we apply a model - independent and generic pdf rescaling technique to extract the scaling properties of the solar wind fluctuations directly from the data .",
    "the aim is to determine a set of plasma parameters that exhibit statistical self - similarity and to verify the nature of the pdf for their fluctuations .",
    "we consider the following bulk plasma parameters : magnetic field magnitude @xmath1 , velocity magnitude @xmath0 , ion density @xmath2 , kinetic and magnetic energy density ( @xmath4 and @xmath3 ) and poynting flux approximated by @xmath5 .",
    "such an approximation of the poynting flux assumes ideal mhd where @xmath11 .",
    "we find that the pdfs of fluctuations in @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 exhibit mono - scaling for up to @xmath12 standard deviations , while @xmath1 and @xmath0 are clearly multi - fractal as found previously @xcite .",
    "the mono - scaling allows us to derive a fokker - planck equation that governs the dynamics of the fluctuations pdfs .",
    "the fokker - planck approach provides a point of contact between the statistical approach and the dynamical features of the system .",
    "this allows us to identify the functional form of the space dependent diffusion coefficient that describes the fluctuations of these quantities as well as to develop a diffusion model for the shape of their pdfs .",
    "we also consider a castaing model where fluctuations are assumed to arise from a varying energy transfer rate @xmath10 in the nonlinear energy cascade , with gaussian distribution for @xmath13 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section ii we will describe the dataset used for this study as well as the rescaling procedure . in section iii the results of the rescaling will be presented .",
    "two possible models of the fluctuations will be discussed in section iv . finally in section",
    "v we will summarize all results discussed throughout this paper .",
    "the solar wind is a supersonic , super - alfvnic flow of incompressible and inhomogeneous plasma .",
    "the wind spacecraft orbits the earth - sun l1 point providing a set of in situ plasma parameters including magnetic field measurements from the mfi experiment @xcite and the plasma parameters from the swe instrument @xcite .",
    "the wind solar wind magnetic field and key parameter database used here comprise over @xmath14 million , @xmath15 second averaged samples from january 1995 to december 1998 inclusive .",
    "the selection criteria for solar wind data is given by the component of the spacecraft position vector along the earth - sun line , @xmath16 , and the vector magnitude , @xmath17 re .",
    "the data set includes intervals of both slow and fast speed streams .",
    "similar to other satellite measurements , short gaps in the wind data file were present . to minimize the errors caused by such incomplete measurements we omitted any intervals where the gap was larger than @xmath18 .",
    "the original data were not averaged nor detrended .",
    "the data are not sampled evenly but there are two dominant sampling frequencies : @xmath19 hz and @xmath20 hz .",
    "we use sampling frequency @xmath21 of @xmath19 as our base and treat other temporal resolutions as gaps when the accuracy requires it ( @xmath22 seconds ) .",
    "let @xmath23 represent the time series of the studied signal , in our case magnetic field magnitude @xmath1 , velocity magnitude @xmath0 , ion density @xmath2 , kinetic energy density @xmath4 , magnetic field energy density @xmath3 or the poynting flux component approximated by @xmath5 .",
    "a set of time series @xmath24 is obtained for each value of the non - overlapping time lag @xmath25 .",
    "the pdf @xmath26 is then generated for each time series @xmath27 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the set of such raw pdfs of the density fluctuations for time lags between @xmath15 seconds and @xmath28 days .    a generic one parameter rescaling method @xcite is applied to these pdfs .",
    "we extract the scaling index @xmath29 , with respect to @xmath25 , directly from the time series of the quantity @xmath30 .",
    "practically , obtaining the scaling exponent relies on the detection of a power law , @xmath31 , for values of the raw pdf peaks and time lag @xmath25 .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the peaks @xmath32 of the unscaled pdfs plotted versus @xmath25 on log - log axes for the four bulk plasma parameters .",
    "we see that the peaks of these pdfs are well described by a power law @xmath33 for a range of @xmath25 up to @xmath34 hours .",
    "we now take @xmath29 to be the scaling index and attempt to collapse all unscaled pdfs @xmath26 onto a single curve @xmath35 using the following change of variables : @xmath36 a self - similar brownian walk with gaussian pdfs on all temporal scales and index @xmath37 is a good example of the process where such collapse can be observed ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for experimental data ,",
    "an approximate collapse of pdfs is an indicator of a dominant self - similar trend in the time series , i.e. , this method may not be sensitive enough to detect multi - fractality that could be present only during short time intervals .",
    "one can treat the identification of the scaling exponent @xmath29 and , as we will see , the non - gaussian nature of the rescaled pdfs ( @xmath38 ) as a method for quantifying the intermittent character of the time series .",
    "another possible interpretation of the rescaling is to treat @xmath26 as the self - similar solution of the equation describing the pdf dynamics .",
    "the mono - scaling of the fluctuations pdf , together with the finite value of the samples variance , indicates that a fokker - planck approach can be used to express the dynamics of the unscaled pdf in time and with respect to the coordinate @xmath30 @xcite . in section",
    "@xmath39 we will use the fokker - planck equation to develop a dynamical model for the fluctuations observed in the solar wind .",
    "ideally , we use the peaks of the pdfs to obtain the scaling exponent @xmath29 , as the peaks are statistically the most accurate parts of the distributions .",
    "in certain cases , however , the peaks may not be the optimal statistical measure for obtaining the scaling index .",
    "for example , the @xmath40 component of the solar wind magnetic field is measured with an absolute accuracy of typically about @xmath41 nt .",
    "such discreteness in the time series introduces large errors in the estimation of the peak values @xmath32 and may not give a correct scaling .",
    "however , if the pdfs rescale , we can in principle obtain the scaling exponent from any point on the curve .",
    "we will illustrate this in the next section where we obtain the rescaling index @xmath29 from two points on the curve @xmath32 and @xmath42 .",
    "we are now ready to present results of the rescaling procedure as applied to the solar wind bulk plasma parameters .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the unscaled ( raw ) pdf curves of the ion density data .",
    "these pdfs , like all others presented in this section , were generated with the bin size decreasing linearly toward the center of the distribution to improve the accuracy of the pdf for small fluctuations . although the entire range of data was used to create these pdfs we truncated the plotted curves for @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a standard deviation of the differenced time series for the specific time lag @xmath25 .",
    "[ fig2 ] then shows @xmath32 plotted versus @xmath25 on log - log axes for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "straight lines on such a plot suggest that the rescaling ( [ rescl ] ) holds at least for the peaks of the distributions . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , lines were fitted with @xmath49 goodness of fit for the range of @xmath25 between @xmath50 minutes and @xmath6 hours , omitting points corresponding to the first two temporal scales as in these cases the sharp peaks of the pdfs can not be well resolved .",
    "the lines suggest self - similarity persists up to intervals of @xmath51 hours .",
    "the slopes of these lines yield the exponents @xmath29 and these are summarized in table [ tab1 ] along with the values obtained from analogous plots of @xmath52 versus @xmath25 which show the same scale break and the same scaling exponent for @xmath53 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , to within the estimated statistical error .    .scaling indices derived from @xmath32 and p(@xmath54 power laws .",

    "[ fig2 ] , gives good collapse of each curve onto a single common functional form for the entire range of the data .",
    "these rescaled pdfs are leptokurtic rather than gaussian and are thus strongly suggestive of an underlying nonlinear process .",
    "the fluctuations pdfs for all mono - scaling quantities investigated here are nearly symmetric .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the strong asymmetry of the pdf of velocity fluctuations in hydrodynamic turbulence reported previously in @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry of the statistics for the velocity increments coincides with the highly intermittent character of the flow and multi - fractal scaling of these fluctuations .",
    "we applied zeroth - order correlation functions , defined separately for the positive and the negative branch of the pdf @xcite , to quantify the asymmetry of fluctuations pdfs for the solar wind .",
    "this analysis was performed using pdfs generated for @xmath55 minutes ( that is , within the scaling region ) . in the case of velocity increments",
    "we find that the negative moment is , on average , @xmath56 lower compared to the positive one . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantities that we have found with self - similar increments do not have appreciable asymmetry .",
    "these show differences between negative and positive moments of about @xmath57 , which is however , well above the statistical error of this procedure .",
    "it has been reported previously @xcite that the pdfs obtained from hydrodynamic turbulence have exponential tails",
    ". these would look linear on the linear - log plots that are used in this paper . in the case of solar wind bulk plasma parameters",
    "we do not find such a clear exponential cutoff region but rather see stretched exponential tails of the form @xmath58 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] where we plot @xmath59 against @xmath60 for all positive fluctuations of the mono - scaling quantities .",
    "it can be seen that , as we move away from the peak , these curves converge to lines and good fits can be obtained in the interval @xmath61 $ ] , where @xmath62 stands for the standard deviation .",

    "the @xmath69 variable has been normalized to the rescaled standard deviation @xmath70 of @xmath38 and the values of the pdf has been modified to keep probability constant in each case to facilitate this comparison .",
    "these normalized pdfs have remarkably similar functional form suggesting a shared process responsible for fluctuations in these four plasma parameters on temporal scales up to @xmath71 hours .",
    "it has been found previously @xcite that the magnetic field magnitude fluctuations are not self - similar but rather multi - fractal .",
    "for such processes the scaling derived from @xmath32 would not be expected to rescale the entire pdf .",
    "to verify this we applied the rescaling procedure for magnetic field magnitude differences @xmath72 .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the result of one parameter rescaling applied to the pdfs of the magnetic field magnitude fluctuations .",
    "we see that the scaling procedure is satisfactory only up to @xmath73 standard deviations of the original sample , despite the satisfactory scaling obtained for the peaks @xmath32 of the pdfs ( see insert of the fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "this confirms the results of @xcite where a two parameter castaing fit to values within @xmath74 standard deviations of the original sample yields scaling in one parameter and weak variation in the other .",
    "attempts to improve the collapse by using information in the tails ( values @xmath75 ) would introduce a significant error in the estimation of the scaling exponent @xmath29 .",
    "we found similar lack of scaling in the fluctuations of the solar wind velocity magnitude and we show the rescaled pdf in the fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "we stress that the log - log plots of the pdf peaks @xmath32 show a linear region for both velocity and magnetic field magnitude fluctuations ( see insert in each figure ) .",
    "their pdfs , however , do not collapse onto a single curve when the rescaling ( [ rescl ] ) is applied .",
    "this lack of mono - scaling is evident when indices derived from @xmath32 and these found for @xmath42 are compared ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the rescaling technique applied in the previous section indicates that , for certain temporal scales , the pdfs of some bulk plasma parameters can be collapsed onto a single master curve .",
    "the challenge now lays in developing physical models that can describe the functional form of this curve .",
    "here we consider two approaches .",
    "the first is a statistical approach where we assume that the fluctuations can be described by a stochastic langevin equation .",
    "the second method is to assume the fluctuations are the result of the nonlinear energy cascade and derive the corresponding pdf form for the rescaled pdfs ( castaing distribution ) @xcite .",
    "the fokker - planck ( f - p ) equation provides an important link between statistical studies and the dynamical approach expressed by the langevin equation @xcite . in the most general form",
    "f - p can be written as : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a pdf for the differenced quantity @xmath30 that varies with time @xmath25 , @xmath78 is the friction coefficient and @xmath79 is related to a diffusion coefficient which we allow to vary with @xmath30 . for certain choices of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , a class of self - similar solutions of ( [ f - p ] ) satisfies the rescaling relation given by ( [ rescl ] ) .",
    "this scaling is a direct consequence of the fact that the f - p equation is invariant under the transformation @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "it can be shown ( see appendix a ) that equations ( [ rescl ] ) and ( [ f - p ] ) combined with power law scaling of the transport coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath79 lead to the following equation for the pdf : @xmath82 , \\label{mdl1}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are constants , @xmath29 is the scaling index derived from the data and @xmath85 and @xmath30 are unscaled pdf and fluctuations respectively . written in this form equation ( [ mdl1 ] ) immediately allows us to identity the functional form of the diffusion coefficient , namely @xmath86 . in appendix",
    "a we show how ( [ mdl1 ] ) can also be expressed as : @xmath87 the partial differential equation ( [ mdl1.5 ] ) can be solved analytically and one arrives at the general solution in the form : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a constant and @xmath90 is the homogeneous solution : @xmath91 we then attempt to fit the predicted solution ( [ mdl2 ] ) to the normalized rescaled pdfs .",
    "the results of such a fit for the fluctuations of the kinetic energy density pdf is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( solid line ) .",
    "this fit is obtained with the following parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 as derived from the rescaling procedure .",
    "we note that the figure is a semi - log plot and thus emphasizes the tails of the distribution - for a different value of the ratio @xmath97 the fit around the smallest fluctuations could be improved .",
    "equation ( [ mdl2 ] ) can not , however , properly model the smallest fluctuations as it diverges for @xmath98 .",

    "we stress that the advection and diffusion processes that we discuss here are of the probability in parameter space for fluctuations and do not refer to the integrated quantities .",
    "we now , for comparison , consider a model motivated directly by a cascade in energy , due to castaing .",
    "this empirical model was developed for the spatial velocity fluctuations recorded from controlled experiments in wind tunnels @xcite and has been applied to the solar wind data @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea of this approach is that , for constant energy transfer rate between spatial scales , all quantities should exhibit a gaussian distribution of fluctuations .",
    "the intermittency is then introduced to the pdf through the fluctuations of the variance @xmath62 of that gaussian distribution .",
    "a log - normal distribution is assumed for the variance @xmath62 : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the most probable variance of the fluctuations and @xmath113 is the variance of @xmath114 . combining these two hypothesis castaing proposed the following functional form for the observed pdf : @xmath115 the dashed line in the fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] shows the castaing curve fitted with parameters @xmath116 and @xmath117 to the @xmath46 pdf .",
    "we can now compare the rescaled pdfs with both f - p and castaing predicted curves which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "we can see from the figure that both models provide an adequate fit to the @xmath66 pdf , and hence will also describe the pdf of other scaling bulk plasma parameters .",
    "both curves , however , fall significantly below observed pdf values for @xmath118 , although the castaing distribution fits the peak of the pdf reasonably well ( see insert in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) .",
    "this departure from the experimental pdf , in the case of the castaing distribution , may reflect the difference between hydrodynamics and mhd turbulence .",
    "in this paper we have applied a generic pdf rescaling method to fluctuations in the solar wind bulk plasma parameters .",
    "we find that , consistent with previous work , magnetic field and velocity magnitude fluctuations are multi - fractal whereas the pdfs of fluctuations in @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be rescaled with just one parameter for temporal scales up to @xmath34 hours .",
    "the presence of intermittency in the plasma flow is manifested in these quantities simply by the leptokurtic nature of their fluctuation pdfs , which show increased probability of large fluctuations compared to that of the normal distribution .",
    "fluctuations on large temporal scales , @xmath119 hours are uncorrelated in that their pdfs converge toward a gaussian distribution .",
    "the fact that all quantities share the same pdf , to within errors , is also strongly suggestive of a single underlying process .",
    "this is also supported by the similar values of the scaling exponents .",
    "the simple scaling properties that we have found allow us to develop a fokker - planck approach which provides a functional form of the rescaled pdfs as well as a langevin equation for the dynamics of the observed fluctuations .",
    "the model shows that both advective and diffusive terms need to be invoked to describe the dynamics of the fluctuations .",
    "the calculated diffusion coefficient is of the form @xmath120 .",
    "we obtained a good fit of the model to our rescaled pdfs over at least @xmath12 standard deviations .",
    "we also examined a castaing model for turbulence and found a set of fit parameters for which both the castaing distribution and our diffusion model have nearly identical form .",

    "<S> the solar wind provides a natural laboratory for observations of mhd turbulence over extended temporal scales . here , we apply a model independent method of differencing and rescaling to identify self - similarity in the probability density functions ( pdf ) of fluctuations in solar wind bulk plasma parameters as seen by the wind spacecraft . whereas the fluctuations of speed @xmath0 and imf magnitude @xmath1 are multi - fractal </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the fluctuations in the ion density @xmath2 , energy densities @xmath3 and @xmath4 as well as mhd - approximated poynting flux @xmath5 are mono - scaling on the timescales up to @xmath6 hours . the single curve , which we find to describe the fluctuations pdf of all these quantities up to this timescale , is non - gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> we model this pdf with two approaches fokker - planck , for which we derive the transport coefficients and associated langevin equation , and the castaing distribution that arises from a model for the intermittent turbulent cascade . </S>"
