    "the gyromagnetic ratio ( g - factor ) of a particle is defined as the ratio of its magnetic moment to its spin angular momentum . for a point - like spin-1/2 particle , the g value",

    "the qed contribution to the sm is the largest , however it is the most precisely known . on the other hand ,",
    "the largest contribution to the @xmath0 uncertainty comes from the hadronic interactions .",
    "when a positive muon decays into a positron and two neutrinos , parity is maximally violated so that the average positron momentum is along the muon spin direction ( in the muon rest frame ) . since observing the decay energy in the laboratory frame is equivalent to observing the decay angle in the center - of - mass system , the muon spin direction can be measured by counting the decay positrons above a certain energy threshold . as a result",

    "this is the main concept of the muon g-2 experiments@xcite . + in our experiment , polarized muons are injected into a superconducting storage ring .",
    "the ring provides a very uniform static dipole magnetic field , @xmath4 .",
    "if the g - factor of a muon were exactly equal to two , the spins and the momenta of the muons would stay parallel during the storage .",
    "this would mean the cyclotron frequency , @xmath5 , of the muon is equal to the spin precession frequency , @xmath6 .",
    "however , due to the anomaly on the magnetic moment , the spin precesses faster than the momentum , @xmath7 ) . the muon spin precession angular frequency relative to its momentum in the presence of a vertical focusing electric field @xmath8 and magnetic field",

    "the difference between two energy spectra is reflected in the asymmetry parameter we measure .",

    "+ the bnl g-2 experiment uses a polarized muon beam produced by the alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) , which is the brightest proton source in its energy class in the world .",
    "protons with an energy of 24 gev hit a nickel target ; pions from this reaction are directed into a pion decay channel where they decay into muons .",
    "muons are naturally polarized when a small forward momentum bite is taken . + our storage ring is a single superconducting c - shape magnet , supplying a  1.45 t uniform field @xcite .",
    "beam muons are injected into the storage ring through a superconducting inflector magnet , which locally cancels the storage ring field and delivers muons approximately parallel to the central orbit @xcite .",
    "+ the bnl g-2 experiment started first data taking in 1997 using pion injection into the storage ring @xcite .",
    "this was similar to what was done in the last cern experiment @xcite .",
    "since the pions fill most of the phase space , there are always a few daughter muons from pion decay which would be captured into stable equilibrium orbits in the storage ring .",
    "the disadvantage of pion injection , was the high background level due to the pions themselves . from 1998 on , our experiment used muon injection . in order to put the muons onto their equilibrium orbit , a fast magnetic kicker was used .",
    "the background level was reduced dramatically and the number of events was substantially increased with muon injection compared to pion injection .",
    "the kicker is located at 90@xmath26 with respect to the inflector and consists of three sets of parallel plates each 1.7 m long , carrying 5200 a for a very short time ( basewidth 400 ns ) @xcite .",

    "+ inside the ring , the decay positrons are observed for approximately 600 @xmath25s by 24 electromagnetic shower calorimeters @xcite consisting of scintillating fibers embedded in lead .",
    "all positrons above a certain threshold are digitized individually with 400 mhz waveform digitizers and the digitized waveforms are stored for the analysis .",
    "the g-2 frequency @xmath6 is determined by fitting the time spectrum of positrons after data selection .",
    "there were four independent analyses of the precession frequency from the 2000 data .",
    "however , only one of them @xcite is going to be described here .",
    "+ when statistics are high , the influence of small effects becomes observable in the data .",
    "deviations in the @xmath29 and the parameter stability when experimental conditions are varied are the signature of the size of these effects .",
    "the 2000 data amount to four times the number of events recorded in 1999 .",
    "positron pileup , coherent betatron oscillations ( cbo ) and muon losses were already observed in 1999 and accounted for in the fitting function @xcite .",
    "the mismatch between the inflector and storage ring acceptances is one of the main sources of cbo .",
    "cbo is also caused by a non - ideal kick to muons when they first enter the ring .",
    "therefore , they are not captured in their equilibrium orbit , but rather oscillate about it . as a result of these oscillations ,",
    "the beam gets closer and further away from the detectors resulting in a modulation of the counting rate .",
    "cbo can be easily seen in the residuals constructed from the difference between the data and the ideal 5-parameter fit ( eq.3 and fig .",

    "the frequency @xmath34 is fixed to the frequency determined by the fourier analysis ( 465.7@xmath270.1 khz ) of the residuals . with the larger data set from 2000 , additionally the g-2 asymmetry ( @xmath23 ) and the phase ( @xmath24 )",
    "are also seen to be modulated with the cbo",

    "running at a lower @xmath40 value leads to storing less beam .",
    "running at @xmath41 made the cbo frequency close to two times the g-2 frequency , which was a difficulty for the analysis , especially for the fit .",
    "+    beam tune and @xmath40 value .",
    "the lines represent the resonances .",
    "pileup , the overlap of positron signals in time , leads to a misidentification of positrons , their arrival time and their energy .",
    "pileup events have half the lifetime of the muons .",
    "the size of the effect is larger at early times compared to late times . the way the data was stored permitted us to resolve pileup using the data itself .",
    "it was preferred to subtract the pileup events from the data because including the pileup related terms into the +     fitting function caused cross - talk between the fit parameters and an increase by a factor of two in the uncertainty of @xmath6 .",
    "pileup pulses were reconstructed artificially from the data itself in the following way .",
    "every positron pulse above a relatively high threshold is digitized at 400 mhz for 80 ns , which is called a `` wfd island '' .",
    "positron pulses are fitted with a pulse - finding algorithm to determine energy and time information .",
    "this pulse - finding algorithm can resolve only events that are more than 3 ns apart .",
    "after the main triggering pulse , there may be a second pulse on the wfd island , which carries the necessary energy and time information for artificial pileup construction .",
    "when there is a main triggering pulse , we looked for a secondary pulse on the same wfd island within a time window offset from the trigger .",
    "if there is a pulse , the main and the secondary pulses are added properly and the time is assigned from the energy - weighted time of the pair ( figure 6 ) .",
    "these constructed pileup events are then subtracted from the data to obtain a pileup - free time spectrum .",
    "figure 7 shows the fit to constructed pileup .",
    "+    schematic view of the pileup construction .    * fig . 7 :* fit to constructed pileup .",
    "+ one of the tests of checking the pileup subtraction quality is to look at the average energy versus time .",
    "the average energy of the detected positrons , for a given g-2 period , with and without the pileup subtraction , is shown in figure 8 .",
    "the effect of pileup can be seen clearly in the upper curve .",
    "after the pileup subtraction the average energy versus time is flat ( lower curve ) .",
    "+ the next step in the analysis was to include muon losses .",
    "the muon losses were determined two different ways .",
    "the pileup subtracted data were fitted at later times ( @xmath42s ) to an 8-parameter functional form ( ideal+cbo ) and extrapolated to earlier times .",
    "only the cbo related parameters were determined at 50 @xmath25s since the lifetime of the cbo is @xmath43s .",
    "the ratio of the data to the extrapolated fitting function shows the effect of the lost muons .",
    "the second method is to look at three - fold coincidences through consecutive scintillator detectors .",
    "since energy loss for muons is much smaller compared to positrons in the calorimeters , muons can travel between consecutive detectors with little energy loss .",
    "the dashed line in figure 9 is the muon losses determined from these three fold coincidences .",
    "the agreement between the two methods is good .",
    "the muon loss time spectrum is empirically added to the fitting function with a scale factor , which is a fit parameter .",
    "+    average energy vs time with ( lower ) and without ( upper ) the pileup subtraction .    * fig . 9 :* muon losses .",
    "+      + it has been previously mentioned that the @xmath40 was 0.137 .",
    "this brought some difficulties to the analysis since @xmath44 was very close to @xmath6 .",
    "the fit had a difficult time to separate these two frequencies .",
    "therefore , we had a considerable systematic effect on @xmath6 . however , the cbo phase changes from 0 to @xmath45 around the storage ring . for that reason , when the data from individual detectors are added ,",
    "this effect becomes almost four times smaller . on the other hand when one looks at the precession frequency determined from the individual detectors ,",
    "the effect is visible .",
    "figure 10 shows the g-2 precession frequency obtained from the individual detectors .",
    "the fitting function used here was the ideal five parameter function including modulation of the number of detected events caused by cbo ( total 8 parameter ) .",
    "a fit to the data in fig 10 gives a @xmath46 for a fit to a constant , which is unacceptable .",
    "when these data are fit to a sine wave ( the cbo phase changes 0 to @xmath45 around the ring ) , the @xmath46 becomes acceptable ( fig .",
    "the central values on @xmath6 for both fits are very close .",
    "+    precession frequency vs detectors when the acceptance change due to cbo is included in the fits .",
    "+ the next step was to make the fitting function more precise by adding the known effects of energy modulation .",
    "one of these effects is the modulation of the g-2 asymmetry by cbo .",
    "the amplitude of the sine wave is reduced dramatically since most of the effect was removed ( fig .",
    "figure 12 represents the result when both asymmetry and phase modulations are included into the fit .",
    "+    precession frequency vs detectors when asymmetry modulation due to cbo is included in the fit function .",
    "precession frequency vs detectors when both asymmetry and phase modulations are included in the fits .",
    "+ this study showed that the effect can be removed completely by adding all known effects to the fitting function .",
    "however , the center frequency value is not very sensitive to the type of functional form used .",
    "+ another method was pursued in the analysis .",
    "that was to sample the time spectrum with the cbo period @xcite , so any cbo related effects can be removed from the data and it can be fit to a five parameter ideal function .",
    "the result of this method was consistent with the result of the method described in detail above .",
    "+ the described analysis determined the precession frequency with 0.7 ppm statistical error .",
    "the most significant contributions to the systematic error were cbo ( 0.21 ppm ) , pileup ( 0.13 ppm ) , gain changes ( 0.13 ppm ) , lost muons ( 0.10 ppm ) and fitting procedure ( 0.06 ppm ) .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath14 is obtained from nmr measurements of the proton resonance frequency in water , which can be related to the free proton resonance frequency @xmath15.@xcite the field is continuously measured using about 150 fixed nmr probes distributed around the ring , in the top and bottom walls of the vacuum chamber .",
    "in addition to this measurement , the field inside the storage ring where the muons are , is mapped with a trolley device .",
    "this device carries 17 nmr probes on it and the measurements were repeated periodically 2 - 3 times a week . + the trolley moves inside the storage ring and measures the field around the ring without breaking the vacuum .",
