    "confinement - induced resonances ( cirs ) , originally predicted in the seminal work of olshanii @xcite and more recently observed experimentally for both bosons @xcite and fermions @xcite , have attracted a great deal of attention during the past few years .",
    "the immediate reason is that they represent a valuable tool for the control of the atomic interactions thereby allowing to enter and probe the regime of strongly correlated bosonic or fermionic many - body systems . beyond this ,",
    "changes of the transversal confinement potential possess direct consequences for the scattering behavior of the atoms in the waveguide such that a multitude of binary resonance profiles are accessible .",
    "examples for the variety of scattering properties in waveguides are multi - channel confinement - induced resonances @xcite , resonant molecule - formation processes and center of mass coupling effects @xcite as well as a dual cir @xcite which leads to complete quantum suppression of scattering .",
    "a recent experiment @xcite on cirs in transversally anisotropic waveguides has shown the necessity of an adequate theoretical approach for describing collisional processes in confined geometries of one- and two - dimensional character . a main result of this experimental work @xcite was the observation of a splitting of the cir - related loss signals in the presence of a transversal anisotropy .",
    "two recent attempts to explain this splitting have not been successful @xcite .",
    "the corresponding studies represent investigations of the pseudo - potential scattering with a single open transverse channel @xcite in the case of tightly confining waveguides . both the width of the cir and the full multichannel character of the problem were not taken into account . on the other hand",
    "it has been shown that the non - separability of the center of mass and internal motion for atomic scattering in anharmonic ( transversally isotropic ) waveguide potentials changes the resonance picture qualitatively and new resonances ( anharmonicity - induced resonances ( airs ) ) are occur where molecular excited center of mass states cross the threshold @xcite .",
    "very recently the coupling of the center of mass excitations in anharmonic isotropic and anisotropic confining potentials to the ground state has been analyzed in great detail in ab initio calculations @xcite .",
    "there a very good agreement of the air splitting with the distance between the maxima of the atomic loss in the experiment @xcite was found .",
    "however , it has not been analyzed what happens with the `` harmonic '' part of the investigated two - body spectrum in the trap and whether the `` harmonic '' cir agrees with previous results @xcite .    in previous works",
    "@xcite the specific ratio @xmath0 ( where @xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath3 and @xmath4 are the harmonic oscillator length , scattering length in free space , reduced atomic mass and harmonic oscillator frequency , respectively ) yielding the position of the cir was defined by the zero @xmath5 of the scattering amplitude @xmath6 in the transversal ground state in the zero - energy limit .",
    "this point also corresponds to the absolute minimum of the transmission coefficient @xmath7 which represents an important scattering observable near the cir @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we explore a situation where not only the ground transversal channel but also excited channels contribute to the scattering process in the waveguide and demonstrate the importance of multichannel scattering effects in the resonant region .    within our description of few - channel ultracold scattering in confined geometries",
    "we observe a mechanism which leads to the splitting of the cir under the action of a transversal anisotropy of the waveguide .",
    "it is based on the fact that the total transmission coefficient @xmath8 , which we define as a sum of partial coefficients @xmath9 emerging from the different transverse ( ground and excited ) states labeled by @xmath10 , @xmath11 averaged over the initial populations @xmath12 , possesses its main contribution near the cir from the first excited transversal state and not from the ground state .",
    "this follows from the observation that @xmath13 possesses a much deeper as well as broader transmission well around its minimum compared to the wells ( minima ) of @xmath14 for the excited states near the cir @xcite .",
    "thus , even for low - energy pair collisions the scattering properties near the cir location are not determined by the partial coefficient @xmath13 , where @xmath15 , but by the behavior of the coefficients @xmath16 in excited states @xmath17 . employing this mechanism we find a splitting of the minimum of the total transmission coefficient ( 1 ) in an anisotropic trap .",
    "the splitting is a consequence of the different dependencies of the partial coefficients @xmath18 on @xmath19 for different states in the resonant region .",
    "a necessary prerequisite of the appearance of this splitting effect is therefore the occupation of excited transversal states in the waveguide .",
    "we emphasize , that the present investigation is performed for harmonic traps , i.e. we investigate the influence of the anisotropy of a harmonic transversal confinement on the cirs @xcite opposite to the above - mentioned works that explore the effects of anharmonicity @xcite and anisotropy @xcite .    in the following section we describe the computational approach to our multichannel scattering problem in the confined quasi-1d geometry .",
    "the corresponding results are discussed in the third section .",
    "the short fourth section is devoted to a discussion of the mechanism leading in the harmonic waveguide with transverse anisotropy to the splitting of the cirs .",
    "finally we provide a brief conclusion .",
    "to calculate the partial transmission coefficients ( the single index @xmath10 is here replaced by the double index @xmath20 indicating the quantum numbers belonging to the different transversal degrees of freedom of the waveguide ) @xmath21 describing the transmission probability from the initial transverse state @xmath22 to all possible final states @xmath23 in the course of the collision of identical bosons in a harmonic waveguide with the transverse trapping potential @xmath24 , we solve the multichannel scattering problem for the 3d hamiltonian @xmath25 depending on the relative variables @xmath26 , with the asymptotic scattering wave function for @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 here the matrix elements @xmath30 of the scattering amplitude describe the transition from the initial channel with the transverse energy @xmath31 $ ] and the relative longitudinal momentum @xmath32 ( @xmath33 being the relative longitudinal collision energy and @xmath34 the total energy ) to the final open channel @xmath23 with @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 are the eigenfunctions of the 2d harmonic oscillator corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath37 .",
    "the latter are degenerate with respect to the quantum number @xmath38 in an isotropic trap @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the asymptotic wave function ( 4 ) is explicitly symmetric with respect to the exchange of the atoms .    in order to solve the multichannel scattering problem ( 3,4 )",
    "we extend the approach developed in @xcite for scattering in three dimensions : the expansion over the spherical harmonics on a grid ( two - dimensional discrete - variable representation ) is replaced by the expansion over the product states @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the eigenfunctions of the 1d harmonic oscillator .",
    "the calculations are performed with the finite - range gaussian approximation @xmath43 for the interparticle interaction with @xmath44 chosen such that we have one weakly - bound state in the potential well .",
    "we do expect that all effects shown below are to a large extent independent of the chosen interaction potential @xmath45 . as an independent check",
    ", we have verified that the results obtained for the four open channel scattering in an isotropic waveguide @xmath39 using the screened coulomb potential @xcite are reproduced by the present approach .",
    "note that for convergence typically 200 basis functions are used .",
    "on @xmath19 and @xmath46 in an isotropic waveguide @xmath47.,width=321 ]     from the initial ground @xmath48 into the transversally excited states @xmath49 for a few values of @xmath19.,width=321 ]    let us first analyze atomic collisions in a transversely isotropic waveguide @xmath39 .",
    "the partial transmission coefficients describing the transmission in the ground @xmath50 and in the first excited @xmath51 and @xmath52 scattering channels are shown in fig.[fig1 ] for different longitudinal collision energies @xmath46 .",
    "obviously the position of the cir is stable with respect to variations of the energy for @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , this position is very close to the value @xmath54 predicted in the zero - energy limit with the pseudo - potential approach @xcite and has been confirmed in subsequent numerical computations with different interatomic potentials @xcite .",
    "hereafter we define the position of the cir in the ground state scattering channel as the minimum of the transmission coefficient @xmath55 which coincides with the zero of the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude @xmath56 in the region @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the minimum of the transmission coefficient @xmath58 in the first excited state ( the position of the cir in the excited scattering state ) is at a nonzero value and the corresponding transmission valley is therefore much less pronounced than in the case of @xmath59 for the ground state .",
    "moreover , the width of the cir differs considerably for the two cases and unlike the ground state the position of the cir in the excited state is strongly dependent on the energy @xmath46 .",
    "these facts , as we will see below , are of crucial importance for the analysis of the region near the cir .",
    "importantly , according to ( 1 ) the total transmission coefficient is determined in a broad neighbourhood of the resonant region @xmath60 by the partial coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( if @xmath61 and @xmath62 are large enough ) @xmath63 which is due to the near - zero values of @xmath59 around its minimum ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "a note is in order here .",
    "the significant occupation of transversally excited states does not necessarily arise due to a finite temperature in thermal equilibrium where the occupation probability is determined by the corresponding boltzmann distribution .",
    "instead , the preparation of the ultracold atomic ensemble in the waveguide itself can lead to an occupation of excited states . this could e.g. be a nonadiabatic loading process into the waveguide .",
    "the resulting nonequilibrium state would show a redistribution of its energy between the longitudinal and transversal degrees of freedom and might eventually thermalize , depending on the number of atoms and integrability aspects of the underlying system @xcite .",
    "atomic collisions near the cir could possibly also lead to an increase of the excited state population .",
    "indeed , the increase of the atomic loss and heating near a cir has been attributed @xcite to inelastic three - body collisions , which lead to the formation of molecules while transferring the molecular binding energy and the following energy release due to possible deexcitation of rovibrationally excited molecules to the kinetic energy of the center of mass motion of the molecule and in particular to the escaping third atom .",
    "subsequent collisions of this third atom can lead to transverse excitations if its kinetic energy exceeds the threshold value @xmath64 .",
    "the binding energy of the most weakly bound molecular state in the waveguide ( see fig.2 in @xcite ) exceeds already this threshold energy . using the calculated scattering amplitudes @xmath65",
    "we have evaluated the transition probabilities @xmath66 @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath38 and @xmath68 .",
    "the calculated probabilities @xmath69 are presented in fig.[fig3e ] for a few values of @xmath19 in the region @xmath70 i.e. between the first and second excited channel thresholds . since the probability @xmath69 approaches to the values @xmath71 one might consider collisions with the atoms accelerated due to molecules formation near cir as a possible mechanism for the emergence of considerable populations of the first excited states @xmath72 .",
    "note also that hereafter we do not address the transmission coefficients @xmath73 with odd quantum numbers @xmath74 because these states are not coupled with the ground and excited states possessing even @xmath75 and @xmath76 .       in an anisotropic waveguide @xmath77 as functions of @xmath19 calculated for a near - threshold collision energy @xmath78.,width=321 ]     in the region @xmath79 of the cir for the isotropic case @xmath47 as well as for anisotropic waveguides with @xmath77 and @xmath80 calculated for @xmath81 . for @xmath82 the splitting of the minimum of the transmission coefficient can be observed . , width=283 ]     in the region @xmath79 of the cir for the isotropic case @xmath47 as well as for anisotropic waveguides with @xmath77 and @xmath80 calculated for @xmath81 . for @xmath82",

    ", width=283 ]     in the region @xmath79 of the cir for anisotropic case @xmath83 as a function of relative population @xmath84 of the first excited manifold @xmath72 .",
    "the splitting of the minimum of the transmission coefficient is still present even for only one percent population of the excited states.,width=321 ]    we now analyze the multichannel scattering amplitude and the corresponding transmission coefficients for anisotropic waveguides for different values of the ratio @xmath82 . in fig.[fig2 ] we present the calculated partial transmission coefficients @xmath85 as a function of @xmath19 for fixed values of @xmath86 and @xmath46 . comparing this result with the isotropic case given in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we see that the anisotropy does not change the overall behavior of the coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the region near the cir .",
    "however , the anisotropy splits the excited states with @xmath49 into two components and changes the @xmath52 coefficient dramatically by splitting the well of the transmission curve . as it is demonstrated in fig.[fig3 ] , the effect of the splitting of the minimum of the partial transmission coefficient @xmath87 can also be observed in the total transmission coefficient @xmath88 ( 1 ) at 5% of the relative population @xmath84 of the first exited states and persists with varying @xmath86 and @xmath46 .",
    "fig.[fig3d ] demonstrates the dependence of the splitting on the relative population @xmath84 calculated in the region @xmath89 compatible with the experiment @xcite .",
    "the effect of the splitting of the transmission coefficient is enhanced with increasing excited state population .     and",
    "anisotropic @xmath90 waveguides as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "below the continuum threshold @xmath91 the calculated binding energy of the weakly - bound state is shown . between the thresholds @xmath91 and @xmath92 the calculated resonant energies @xmath93 were determined by the minimum of the transmission coefficient @xmath55 . between the @xmath91 and @xmath94",
    "thresholds the resonant energy @xmath93 coincides with the location of the zero of @xmath95 .",
    "bold solid curves with the full dots correspond to the isotropic case @xmath47 and the thin curves with open circles to the anisotropic case @xmath90 .",
    "indices @xmath22 label the splitted sub - levels of the threshold energies @xmath96 of the excited states with @xmath38 . for the second excited threshold with @xmath97",
    "only the lowest sub - level @xmath98 is shown.,width=321 ]    in the computations , the colliding energy @xmath46 was chosen in agreement with the conditions of the experiment @xcite , where @xmath46 , even at maximal heating , has remained below @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath100 .",
    "it should be noted that the pronounced shift of the minimum of the @xmath8 coefficients with varying @xmath46 is due to the considerable dependence of the partial coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath51 on @xmath33 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "this effect might be responsible for the shift of the maximum of the atom loss in the experiment @xcite in the direction of increasing values for @xmath2 . using this assumption",
    "we can fix @xmath101 as being closest to the experimental conditions @xcite by choosing from the calculated @xmath102 curves for @xmath47 the one whose position of the minimum coincides more close with the point of maximal atomic loss in the experiment .",
    "to clarify the origin of the splitting of the partial coefficient @xmath52 we have calculated the spectrum of the near - threshold bound state and resonant states of the atomic dimer in the confining trap as a function of @xmath19 ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "the resonant energies @xmath103 are determined by the position of the minimum of the partial coefficient @xmath55 , where the two - body total energy @xmath34 was varied between the thresholds corresponding to the ground state @xmath104 and the second excited states @xmath105 $ ] with @xmath106 .",
    "these resonant states were defined in @xcite as cirs with non - zero energies .",
    "the binding energy @xmath107 of the atomic dimer in the harmonic trap with respect to the ground state threshold @xmath91 has been calculated by solving the corresponding eigenvalue problem .    in analyzing the results it is important to note the different dependence of the position of the cir obtained for the different transmission curves @xmath108 in fig.[fig1 ] on the collisional energy @xmath46 .",
    "since the resonant energy @xmath93 belonging to the cir in the ground state strongly changes with varying @xmath19 near the value @xmath0 ( see figure [ fig4 ] where a steep descent can be observed with increasing @xmath109 ) the dependence of @xmath55 on the energy @xmath46 near the minimum position is very weak ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "opposite to this , the dependence of the resonant energy @xmath93 for the first excited states on @xmath19 is much smoother ( see uppermost black curve with full dots in fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "this leads to a considerably stronger dependence of the minimum of @xmath51 and @xmath52 on @xmath19 on @xmath33 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .    in the anisotropic waveguide ,",
    "the resonant curve @xmath110 of the cir of the ground state splits into two components which are shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the energetically lower ( 0,2)-component qualitatively repeats the behavior of the resonant energy curve ( cir ) of the isotropic case .",
    "this is why the anisotropy causes only a limited quantitative change for the @xmath50 coefficient .",
    "however , the behavior of the energetically upper ( 2,0)-component is different ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "the resonance curve @xmath93 of this component is flat for the complete parameter region of @xmath19 which leads to a strong change with respect to the energy dependence of the @xmath52 coefficient , including in particular a strong change of the corresponding positions of the minima ( maxima ) with respect to @xmath109 .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath51 coefficient is determined by the energetically lowest resonant curve @xmath93 emerging from the @xmath97 threshold in the isotropic case which is deformed only slightly by the anisotropy .",
    "this is why the difference between @xmath111 and @xmath112 is significantly smaller when compared to the case of the @xmath52 coefficient .",
    "the above model could potentially also explain the appearance of additional cirs with further increase of the anisotropy @xmath82 as seen in @xcite . increasing @xmath82 the energetical distance between the sub - levels characterized by @xmath113 decreases .",
    "this leads to a considerable increase of the populations @xmath114 of higher excited states and in particular to an increase of the contribution of these states to the total transmission coefficient @xmath8 ( see eq.(1 ) ) .",
    "the key for the understanding of the mechanism of the splitting of the cir under the action of an anisotropic harmonic trap is the diatomic spectrum of the weakly - bound and resonant states in the harmonic waveguide given in fig.6 .",
    "it also explains why the previous considerations in the zero - energy limit near the ground state threshold did not provide any splitting of the cir defined as the singularity of @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "actually , so far it was implicitly supposed that the resonant energy curve @xmath93 behaves linearly as it crosses the ground state threshold @xmath116 for @xmath117 and becomes subsequently a weakly - bound state for @xmath118 ( see , for example , fig.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it was natural to expect that in an anisotropic waveguide @xmath119 leading to the splitting of the first excited threshold @xmath120 ( see fig.6 in the present paper and fig.1(b ) in @xcite ) the resonant curve @xmath93 will also split into two components @xmath121 and @xmath122 crossing the ground state threshold at the points @xmath123 and @xmath124 with the separation @xmath125 proportional to the threshold splitting @xmath126 .",
    "these expectations were confirmed in the experiment by measuring the distance between the maxima of the atomic loss in the anisotropic waveguide which was interpreted as @xmath125 ( see fig.3(c ) in @xcite ) .",
    "however , our extension of the calculation of the resonant energy @xmath93 to the region @xmath118 has shown a strongly nonlinear behavior of the curve @xmath93 ( see fig.6 ) while shifting the point where the resonant curve @xmath93 crosses the ground state threshold to the value @xmath127 .",
    "this means that at the point @xmath128 we observe a complete rearrangement of the spectrum .",
    "the first resonant state @xmath93 becomes a new weakly - bound state once we cross this point and equivalently for the higher excited resonant states which convert into each other .",
    "this behavior , i.e. the rearrangement of the spectrum of the two - body system at the point @xmath128 , remains in the anisotropic waveguide ( see fig.6 ) .",
    "this is why the splitting of the singularity of the function @xmath115 was not observed near the point @xmath117 in the anisotropic harmonic waveguide @xcite but one can observe the splitting of the minimum in the effective transmission coefficient @xmath8 ( eq.(1 ) ) due to the quasi - crossing of the resonant curves @xmath122 and @xmath121 leading to the splitting of the minimum in the @xmath52 coefficient ( see fig.3 ) qualitatively equal to the width of the quasi - crossing near @xmath117 .",
    "this width is proportional to the first excited threshold splitting @xmath126 in the presence of the anisotropy and in good agreement with the experimental value for the splitting of the maxima of the atom loss @xcite .",
    "our investigation and following analysis demonstrates that multichannel scattering in anisotropic harmonic waveguides can lead to a splitting of the confinement - induced resonance .",
    "a necessary ingredient is a population of at least a few percent of the transversally excited states which can certainly occur via e.g. a nonadiabatic loading process of the atoms into the waveguide .",
    "there are several ways to improve our suggested model which would help further clarifying the behaviour of the splitting effect with varying parameters and depending on the initial preparation of the atomic ensemble .",
    "first , one would have to take into account the velocity distribution ( distribution over the collision energy @xmath33 ) in the longitudinal direction @xcite .",
    "shifts and splittings of the cir due to anharmonicities of the trap @xcite and the influence of the inelastic channel of molecule formation have also to be determined .    it is known that the anharmonicity of the trap couples the relative and center - of - mass motion of the colliding atoms and can lead to additional anharmonicity - induced resonances ( airs ) due to the removal of the degeneracy of the center - of - mass and relative motions @xcite . however , the airs are supposed to be much narrower than the cirs and , as a consequence , more difficult to be detected experimentally because of the relatively weak anharmonic coupling with respect to the interatomic interaction @xcite . as a conclusion ,",
    "the observation of these airs presumably represents a challenging experimental problem .",
    "explicitly suppressing the anharmonicity of the waveguide could lead to a discrimination between the two mechanisms causing a splitting of the cirs .",
