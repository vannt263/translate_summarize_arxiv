    "in our universe we experience a profound matter - antimatter asymmetry .",
    "it s fundamental origin is not known .",
    "the standard explanation for this asymmetry is attributed to the dynamic evolution of the universe shortly after the `` big - bang '' . according to the mechanism first sketched out by sacharov already in the year 1967 @xcite ,",
    "a cp - violating process taking place at high temperatures ( such as the asymmetric decay of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bosons below the gut - scale ) combined with a temporary deviation from thermal equilibrium , as could have been caused by the rapid expansion of the universe , can transform a slight matter - antimatter asymmetry at high temperatures into a profound asymmetry at low temperatures .",
    "the low baryon to photon ratio of @xmath12 encountered in our universe in its present state is usually interpreted as a remnant of a former minuscule asymmetry in the baryon - antibaryon - number of the order of @xmath13 . according to the common belief there were roughly @xmath14 baryons vs. @xmath15 antibaryons at the time , when the temperature of the universe fell below the rest - mass of the nucleon .",
    "we expect a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "so it might be more appropriate to talk of an asymmetry in the quark anti - quark ( and lepton / antilepton ) pairs with mutual annihilation of quarks and anti - quarks taking place at a somewhat lower temperature .",
    "however , whether it is the nucleons that annihilate at the nucleon threshold , or the quarks at roughly the pion - threshold does nt really change the basic picture . ] the baryons / antibaryons annihilated at this threshold , predominantly into photons , leaving 1 baryon and @xmath15 photons behind .",
    "this primordial ratio of @xmath15 photons per baryon then was preserved - at least approximately - during the subsequent expansion .",
    "although such a scenario is thinkable , in the sense that it does nt appear to be in direct contradiction to any fundamental physical laws , and is furthermore supported by ( indirect ) experimental evidence such as today s high value for the photon to baryon ratio which appears to fit well with the ratio predicted from primordial nucleosynthesis is correct , the prediction of @xmath16 from primordial nucleosynthesis and the wmap - value agree better than 50% .",
    "however , there are some problems with respect to the relative abundances of h to he4 to d to li7 . whereas the he4/h and li7/h abundances indicate a common value of @xmath17 , the d / h - ratio requires a higher value , which lies outside the error bars of the former value .",
    "see @xcite and the references therein for a detailed analysis .",
    "] , the scenario relies on several implicit assumptions , which appear questionable .",
    "the first assumption is , that our universe is accurately described by a homogeneous friedman robertson walker ( frw ) model , over the full temperature range from the gut - energy - breaking scale to the low energy scale today .",
    "this assumption has been quite successful in explaining many of the phenomena encountered in the observable universe today in terms of a solution of the field equations of only moderate mathematical complexity . on the other hand , today s standard",
    "cosmological has lost much of its original charm .",
    "it has turned into a complex model , relying on the experimental determination of several crucial parameters ( such as the fraction of cold dark matter , dark energy ) whose numerical values can not be predicted by today s methods and whose fundamental origin is not known",
    ". there is _ no theorem _ that the universe _ must _ be describable by an frw - model .",
    "in fact , the so called holographic solution , an exact solution to the einstein - field equations with zero cosmological constant , was shown to be a potential alternative model for the universe @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the frw - model the holographic solution has no free parameters .",
    "yet it s unique properties fit today s observational facts very well .",
    ", there is only one free `` parameter '' in the holographic solution : the radial position @xmath18 of a geodesically moving observer .",
    "@xmath18 has the meaning of a scale factor ( or alternatively : curvature radius ) and is proportional to the proper time @xmath19 measured by a geodesically moving observer , when traveling from the hot central region ( of planck - density ) to the low density region today . from @xmath19 all other relevant cosmological parameters , such as the local scale factor @xmath18 , the current hubble - value @xmath20 , the local value of the microwave - background temperature @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 ) , the total local matter - density @xmath23 etc .",
    "these parameters are related by non - trivial relations , such as @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( in units @xmath26 ) . remarkably , all relations predicted from the holostar model are fulfilled to an accuracy of a few percent in the observable universe today . ] but its evolution very much differs from that of a frw - universe .",
    "the second assumption is tied to the first .",
    "the standard scenario of big - bang baryogenesis makes heavy use of the argument , that in a homogeneously expanding frw - type universe the particle numbers of the different species in a co - moving volume - element should remain constant during the expansion .",
    "this assumption is model - dependent .",
    "although it is true in the frw - model , it can fail in other models .",
    "in the holographic solution the baryon to photon ratio is time dependent and evolves linearly with temperature . in the matter - dominated era .",
    "@xmath27 is the mass of a fundamental particle , such as the electron or proton .",
    "this mass must not necessarily be constant .",
    "it can be an arbitrary function of temperature .",
    "therefore the number ratio of baryons to photons only depends linearly on the temperature , when the particle mass is independent of temperature ( or radius ) in the interior holostar space - time .",
    "yet if the radiation temperature is referenced to the mass of a fundamental particle , we have a linear dependence .",
    "the reason for the different evolution of baryon- and photon - number with temperature ( or rather with the ratio @xmath28 ) in the holographic universe is , that in the holographic solution is is not relative particle numbers which is conserved during the expansion , but rather the relative energy- and entropy - densities .",
    "if one extrapolates this dependence back to @xmath29 , one gets the remarkable result that baryon to photon ratio in the holographic solution is nearly unity at the electron - mass threshold , i.e. when @xmath30 .",
    "this points to a thermodynamic origin of this ratio . ]",
    "the third assumption is about the nature of the phase - transition at the time of baryogenesis .",
    "the implicit assumption in the standard cosmological model is , that the phase transition caused a vast imbalance in particle numbers almost instantly : if one compares the temperature - dependencies of the particle interaction rates with the hubble rate , one can conclude quite confidently that the very early universe must have been in thermodynamic equilibrium . than the hubble rate in the radiation dominated phase . ]",
    "this means , that the number- and energy - densities of all known particle species , such as baryons and photons , must have been roughly equal at the time slightly before baryogenesis .",
    "slightly after baryogenesis the standard cosmological model , however , postulates a discrepancy in the energy- and number - densities of photons and ( left over ) nucleons of the order of @xmath31 .",
    "this extreme imbalance in particle numbers then is assumed to have been preserved throughout the whole intermediate energy range up to nucleosynthesis and beyond , down to the low temperatures encountered today .",
    "the justification for this type of phase transition is , that it provides a plausible explanation for the profound matter anti - matter asymmetry in our universe at low temperatures , if one assumes a minuscule asymmetry at high temperatures ( as the high ratio of photons to baryons observed today seems to imply ) .",
    "unfortunately there is no mechanism which comes close to explain the small primordial asymmetry of order @xmath13 . as long as this crucial assumption , which lies at the heart of the matter anti - matter problem , has not found a satisfactory theoretical explanation , it is worthwhile to explore alternatives .",
    "in this paper i attempt to give an alternative explanation for the matter - antimatter asymmetry , which is based on equilibrium thermodynamics of an ultra - relativistic gas of fermions and bosons .",
    "the crucial observation is , that whenever the ultra - relativistic fermions develop a _ non - zero chemical potential _",
    "comparable to the temperature , this can act as a natural - purely thermodynamic - cause for a _ profound _ matter - antimatter asymmetry at high temperatures .    that a non - zero chemical potential induces",
    "a matter - antimatter asymmetry is a well known fact from microscopic statistical thermodynamics .",
    "the question is , under what circumstances such a non - zero chemical potential can arise .",
    "it turns out that self - gravitating systems , which are characterized by the property that their entropy can be expressed as a function of the energy alone , i.e. @xmath32 , provide a natural setting for a non - zero chemical potential of the fermions at ultra - relativistic temperatures .",
    "such systems are characterized by a strict proportionality between the total energy and the free energy @xmath33 .",
    "the constant value of @xmath1 can only take on a very narrow range : @xmath34 .",
    "the standard case of an ultra - relativistic gas with zero chemical potential is described by @xmath7 . whenever @xmath35 , non - zero values for the chemical potentials of the fermions necessarily arise .",
    "classical black holes have values of @xmath1 in the range @xmath36 ( @xmath37 for a schwarzschild black hole , @xmath38 for an extreme kerr - newman black hole ) .",
    "an interesting value is @xmath39 , which is realized within the holographic solution . for @xmath39 the free energy",
    "is minimized to zero .",
    "the question , by what physical process the non - zero chemical potentials of the fermions can arise in the first place , will not be answered in this paper .",
    "it seems clear , that one requires some ( local ) violation of @xmath40 and/or @xmath41 . in order to save the @xmath42-theorem @xmath43",
    "would have to be violated locally as well .",
    "the weak interactions are known to violate @xmath41 maximally .",
    "@xmath40 is violated in certain weak decay processes .",
    "quite interestingly , the rotating holographic solution appears to provide a natural setting for a significant local @xmath40-violation of the macroscopic state , if the interior ultra - relativistic particles ( such as neutrinos or anti - neutrinos ) are aligned along the direction of the exterior rotation axis .",
    ", as the primary direction of motion of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos in the holographic solution differs in the two half - spheres defined by the exterior axis .",
    "any particle in the holostar solution must acquire a highly relativistic , nearly radial motion .",
    "if the neutrinos only have one helicity state ( as assumed in the standard model of particle physics ) the neutrinos ( with spin opposite to their direction of flight ) will preferentially move outward in one half - sphere , whereas the anti - neutrinos ( with spin in direction of flight ) will preferentially move inward . for",
    "the other half - sphere the situation is reversed . ]",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "the paper is divided into five principal sections . in section 2 the thermodynamic properties of the most general case of an ultra - relativistic gas of fermions and bosons",
    "is discussed .",
    "a relation between the chemical potential per temperature of the gas and the dimensionless ratio @xmath0 of the system will be derived . in section 3",
    "i will discuss the relation between energy and entropy for several self - gravitating systems and will demonstrate , how the dimensionless ratio @xmath1 determines the global and local properties of the system . in section 4",
    "necessary conditions are discussed , under which an ultra - relativistic gas can develop a non - zero chemical potential . in section 5 the findings of the previous sections will be discussed for for some particular self - gravitating systems .",
    "section 6 then describes an alternative scenario for the origin of the matter - antimatter asymmetry , using the holostar solution as a simple model .",
    "the objective of this section is to derive the thermodynamic properties for the most general case of an ultra - relativistic ideal gas consisting out of bosons and fermions .",
    "most of the explicit derivations will be done for fermions .",
    "the results then are extended for the more general case of a gas consisting out of bosons , fermions and anti - fermions .",
    "an ultra - relativistic gas must be described by the grand canonical ensemble : at ultra - relativistic temperatures we will have copious particle - interchange reactions between the different particle species .",
    "each species exchanges particles , energy and entropy with the other species .",
    "the number of particles within any given species can not be considered fixed , but rather has to adjust to the thermodynamic constraints .",
    "let us assume , that the time - scale of the interaction processes is small enough so that thermal equilibrium can be attained , yet that the interactions are weak enough so that the gas can be described - at least approximately - as an ideal gas of massless , essentially non - interacting particles .",
    "these assumptions should be valid at the high temperatures and densities encountered in the very early universe .    under the ideal gas assumption",
    "the contribution of the individual particle species to the extrinsic quantities , such as entropy and energy , can be calculated separately .",
    "the total for each ( extrinsic ) quantity is formed just by summing up the individual contributions .",
    "i will first consider a gas consisting only out of fermions .",
    "the bosons , anti - bosons and anti - fermions will be added later .",
    "this only changes some numerical factors , not the general picture . for convenience units @xmath44",
    "will be used throughout this paper .",
    "a gas at ultra - high temperatures is expected to consist exclusively out of elementary ( i.e. not composed ) particles .",
    "the main characteristics , by which elementary particles can be distinguished from each other are mass , spin and charge(s ) . at ultra - high temperatures some of",
    "the characteristic features distinguishing different particle species from each other will become blurred : the particles will act more and more like truly massless particles , the higher the temperature becomes . at ultra - high energies",
    "the particle s rest mass is an utterly insignificant correction to the energy - momentum relation @xmath45 .",
    "the actual value of the spin of a particle does nt play a significant role at ultra - high temperatures either , as all transverse spin - directions are heavily suppressed .",
    "we might be able to distinguish the particles by their different charges .",
    "however , if the @xmath46-picture is correct , all known charges ( electro - weak , strong ) will unify at some high energy , so that the charge looses it s distinguishing quality at high energies . furthermore the fine - structure constant , as well as the other coupling constants , are expected to remain small , even at the planck energy , so that the electric charge - as well as the other charges - only provide a very moderate correction to the ideal gas law .",
    "if the gas is neutral , the charge(s ) of the particles most likely will be quite irrelevant for the thermodynamic properties of a gas at ultra - high temperatures .    therefore , at energies well above the electro - weak scale it is not unreasonable to assume that the particles are only distinguished by the different representations of the poincare - group for a massless particle .",
    "the only label of a ( non - tachyonic ) particle in the massless sector of the poincare - group is the particle s helicity .",
    "if the macroscopic state of the system does not single out a preferred axis ( no rotation ) , the spin of a particle is only relevant to the thermodynamic description in the sense , that the two opposite spin - components provide separate degrees of freedom that must be included in the counting of the fundamental degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore the only relevant _ microscopic _ parameter describing a neutral , isotropic gas of ultra - relativistic fermions in thermodynamic equilibrium should be the number of degrees of freedom of the fermions .",
    "let us denote this number by @xmath47 .",
    "however , we also have to consider the _ macroscopic _ thermodynamic parameters .",
    "therefore we can not rule out the possibility that the fermions have a non - zero chemical potential . if this happens to be the case ,",
    "it is reasonable to conjecture that all fermionic species have the _ same _ chemical potential at ultra - relativistic energies : the chemical potential is a measure of how much energy must be invested to add a new particle to a closed system , without changing its entropy or volume @xmath48 . at ultra - high temperatures , where the rest - masses , charges etc . of the fermions",
    "are utterly negligible , the energy required to add a new particle to the gas is expected to be only a ( linear ) function of temperature , quite independent of the nature of the particle .",
    "let us denote the ratio of the fermionic chemical potential to the temperature by @xmath49 . according to the above discussion an ultra - relativistic gas of fermions",
    "will be fully described by just two dimensionless parameters : the number of fermionic degrees of freedom @xmath47 and the chemical potential per temperature @xmath50 .",
    "we now proceed to determine the thermodynamic properties of an ultra - relativistic gas of fermions .",
    "the relevant quantity in the grand - canonical formalism is the grand canonical potential @xmath51 , which is defined as a function of temperature @xmath43 , chemical potential @xmath52 and volume @xmath53 . for an ultra - relativistic gas with @xmath47 fermionic degrees of freedom with energy - momentum relation @xmath54",
    "the grand canonical potential is given by :    @xmath55    by introducing the dimensionless integration variable @xmath56 we can cast @xmath57 into another form :    @xmath58    where we have set the integration ranges to zero and infinity and replaced the chemical potential per temperature with the dimensionless parameter @xmath50 :    @xmath59    @xmath50 depends on @xmath52 and @xmath43 , which are both _",
    "independent _ variables in the grand canonical formalism",
    ". therefore , whenever we calculate the thermodynamic quantities from the grand - canonical potential via partial derivatives , we _ must _",
    "treat @xmath50 as a function of the _ independent _ variables @xmath52 and @xmath43 .",
    "the integral in equation ( [ eq : j0 ] ) can be transformed to the following integral by a partial integration :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the mean occupancy number of the fermions :    @xmath62    the thermodynamic equations for an ideal gas at ultra - relativistic temperature can be expressed exclusively in terms of definite integrals , whose integrand contains @xmath61 multiplied by an integer power of @xmath63 .",
    "i will denote these integrals by @xmath64 :    @xmath65    such integrals can be evaluated by the poly - logarithmic function ( see the appendix for specific formula ) .      according to the grand canonical formalism",

    "the total energy is denoted by @xmath76 , the energy - density by @xmath77 and the energy per particle by @xmath78 .",
    "the grand - canonical potential @xmath57 is related to the total energy via the well - known relation :    @xmath79    keep in mind that @xmath57 is defined as a function of @xmath43 , @xmath53 and @xmath52 , so that taking a partial derivative with respect to @xmath76 is tricky .",
    "the energy - density @xmath80 is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature and proportional to the number of ultra - relativistic degrees of freedom , via @xmath47 :    @xmath81    combining equations ( [ eq : s ] , [ eq : ef ] ) we can derive a relation between the entropy , the energy and the temperature :    @xmath82    the ratio of @xmath83 will turn out important later , so we have denoted it by @xmath1 :    @xmath84    note that according to equation ( [ eq : kappa ] ) @xmath1 is defined exclusively in terms of the thermodynamic quantities @xmath66 , @xmath43 and @xmath76 .",

    "the chemical potentials of a particle and its anti - particle add up to zero : @xmath134 .",
    "this restricts the chemical potential of the bosons : as ultra - relativistic bosons can not have a positive chemical potential , the _ chemical potential of any ultra - relativistic bosonic species must be zero _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath135 , whenever the energy is high enough to create boson / anti - boson pairs . this restriction does not apply to the fermions , which can have a non - zero chemical potential at ultra - relativistic energies , as both signs of the chemical potential are allowed .",
    "so for ultra - relativistic fermions we can fulfill the relation @xmath136 with non - zero @xmath137",
    ".    in the following discussion let us take the convention , that any fermion with @xmath138 is classified as ordinary matter , so that all of the anti - fermions have a negative chemical potential .",
    "as has been discussed before , it is reasonable to assume that at ultra - high temperatures all fermions will have the same universal value for the chemical potential , which is expected to be proportional to the temperature .",
    "if the fermions have a non - zero chemical potential , we can distinguish bosons from fermions in an operational sense by their different chemical potentials .",
    "we do nt have to determine the particle s spin ( integer for bosons , half - integer for fermions ) .    according to the previous discussion an ideal ( uncharged , locally isotropic ) gas at ultra - relativistic temperatures",
    "is characterized by just three dimensionless numbers : the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom @xmath131 and @xmath47 and the ratio of the chemical potential of the fermions to the temperature , @xmath49 .",
    "henceforth we will express the thermodynamic properties of the system in terms of these three fundamental parameters .    for many of the following relations it is convenient to replace @xmath47 and @xmath131 with the ratio of bosonic to fermionic degrees of freedom :    @xmath139    and the total number of degrees of freedom    @xmath140    we take the convention here , that @xmath47 and @xmath131 denote the degrees of freedom of one particle species , _ including _ particle and antiparticle .",
    "with this convention a photon gas ( @xmath141 ) is described by @xmath142 ( there are two photon degrees of freedom : the photon is its own anti - particle ; it comes in two helicity states ) .",

    "it is quite remarkable , that the assumption of non - zero chemical potential gives us a _ thermodynamic _",

    "we have seen that the allowed range for @xmath1 is quite restricted : @xmath34 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath1 can only vary very moderately within a particular thermodynamic model , at least at high temperatures .",
    "here we are not interested in the most general thermodynamic model possible , but rather in the cases which are relevant from a physical perspective .",
    "as has been already discussed in the previous section , at ultra - high temperatures one expects @xmath50 to be nearly constant : due to the lack of a specific mass- or energy scale at ultra - high temperatures the chemical potential of an ultra - relativistic fermion will depend nearly linearly on the temperature .",
    "as @xmath1 is a function of @xmath50 and @xmath173 only , it must be nearly constant whenever the ratio of bosonic to fermionic degrees of freedom @xmath173 does not change and the chemical potential of the ultra - relativistic fermions has the expected nearly linear temperature - dependence .    from equation ( [ eq :",

    "are there other values of @xmath1 which might be of relevance and are there actually systems - in theory and in praxis - that can be described by a specific value of @xmath35 ?      before i attempt to answer this question , it is instructive to find out what more can be inferred about the thermodynamic properties of a closed system with nearly constant @xmath1 . in order to make specific predictions",
    "some additional assumptions are required .",
    "we are interested in the thermodynamic behavior of a gas at ultra - high temperatures , i.e. temperatures well above the electron mass threshold .",
    "such extreme temperatures are only conceivable for self - gravitating systems , such as in the early phase of the universe or during relativistic collapse of a massive star . for sufficiently compact gravitationally bound objects , such as neutron stars ( and",
    "even more so for black holes ) there is a more or less rigid relationship between size (= boundary area ) and the total energy ( = asymptotic gravitating mass ) of the system .",
    "it appears as if this is a universal property of bounded self gravitating systems , whose internal energy sources - such as thermo - nuclear reactions - have ceased so that their energy output is determined by gravitational phenomena alone .",
    "whenever there is a definite relationship between the system s spatial extension and its total energy , i.e. @xmath265 - or alternatively @xmath266 , where @xmath267 is the system s boundary area - the temperature can only depend on @xmath76 .",
    "this follows from the ultra - relativistic gas law @xmath268 and the assumption of scale - invariance at ultra - high temperatures . in this case",
    "the entropy will also be an exclusive function of @xmath76 , as @xmath269 at ultra - relativistic temperatures .",
    "the result is , that whenever the temperature of a system is high enough and it s spatial extension depends only on its total energy , the system s entropy can be expressed as a function of @xmath76 alone :    @xmath270    this is even true for the most extreme version of a self - gravitating system , a black hole : although the `` volume '' of a black hole can not be properly defined and it s interior matter state clearly is not that of an ultra - relativistic gas , it s boundary area @xmath271 remains a meaningful concept . for a spherically symmetric black hole",
    "we find @xmath272 . in the more general case of a kerr - newman black hole",
    "the entropy also depends on the exterior conserved quantities , which are the black hole s angular momentum @xmath57 and charge @xmath273 .",

    "it describes a self - gravitating system of arbitrary size with an interior string equation of state .",
    "the holostar has properties very similar to a black hole .",
    "most notably its entropy and temperature at infinity are proportional to the hawking result , as can be shown by simple microscopic statistical thermodynamic analysis of the interior matter - filled space - time . the holographic solution and its properties",
    "are discussed extensively in @xcite . here",
    "i will just point out some of the results which are relevant in the context of this paper .",
    "for any thermodynamic system the total energy @xmath76 is one of its key variables .",
    "in contrast to the entropy , which is a pure number , and the temperature , which is a _ local _ parameter , whose normalization is tied to the total energy , the concept of total energy is somewhat ambiguous in a curved space - time . in general relativity",
    "it is of paramount importance to define the point of reference , from which the total energy of the space - time is calculated . in the black hole case",
    "the only sensible reference `` point '' is the position of an asymptotic observer at spatial infinity .",
    "the temperature and energy attributed to a black hole refer to this point of reference .",
    "in contrast to a black hole the holostar solution is regular throughout the whole space - time .",
    "there is no event - horizon which separates two causally disconnected regions",
    ". therefore other choices of reference - point are possible .",
    "if we take spatial infinity as reference point , we get @xmath309 , equal to the black hole case .",
    "this is not unexpected , because a holostar viewed from the exterior space - time is practically indistinguishable from a black hole .",
    "however , another natural reference point is the position of the holostar s spherical boundary membrane .",
    "the effective potential for the geodesic motion of particles has a global minimum at this position , so that the membrane might be viewed as a `` better '' reference position for a stationary observer . if one calculates the total energy with respect to this reference point ( by a _",
    "proper _ integral over the interior energy - density ) one gets @xmath327 , where @xmath328 is the radial coordinate position of the holostar s boundary . for large holostars @xmath328 is nearly identical to the holostar s gravitational radius , so that @xmath329 .",
    "the entropy of the holostar is proportional to its boundary area , i.e. @xmath330 .",
    "therefore the holostar is characterized by @xmath331 , if the total energy is evaluated at the boundary membrane .",
    "this dependence translates to @xmath332 , which predicts @xmath333 , which is the correct temperature dependence for the holostar s surface temperature at the boundary membrane .",
    "using the exact numerical figures from @xcite ( and setting @xmath334 ) one finds @xmath335 , from which @xmath336 follows , exactly the result derived in @xcite and independently in @xcite .",
    "@xmath337 is a ( constant ) scale factor with dimensions of length , roughly equal to twice the planck length . , it s internal temperature with @xmath338 and the temperature measured at infinity with @xmath339 .",
    "therefore the holographic solution reproduces the hawking result up to a constant factor .",
    "however , the constant factor could not be determined in @xcite , because it depends on the total number of particle degrees of freedom at high energies , which is not known .",
    "yet it is possible to equate the holostar s temperature at infinity to the hawking temperature , which then allows an unambiguous determination of the interior temperature and the entropy , and as a by - product an estimate for the total number of fundamental particle degrees of freedom at ultra - high temperatures . ]",
    "a third natural reference point is that of a _ geodesically moving _ observer in the _ interior _ space - time .",
    "note , that this is a _ local _ point of reference , as the observer moves - in highly relativistic motion - through the interior space - time .",
    "but the local observer sees only a small fraction of the whole space - time : he can never look beyond his current hubble - radius . , similar to the behavior of the hubble - radius in an isotropically expanding frw - type universe . there is some - albeit quite tentative - evidence , that hubble - radius of the geodesically moving observer in the interior holostar space - time might be identified with a local acceleration horizon .",
    "a geodesically moving observer in the interior holostar space - time is accelerated ( as viewed from the static coordinate frame ) .",
    "the proper acceleration falls off over time .",
    "furthermore , due to the negative radial pressure even a ( nearly ) geodesically moving observer will feel a slight deceleration in his frame , which falls off over time .",
    "the distance to the acceleration horizon is inverse proportional to the acceleration .",
    "this means , that the acceleration horizon @xmath340 grows with time .",
    "there is some evidence , that @xmath341 .",
    "] one can not expect that the global relations are applicable to this local observer .",
    "if we restrict the calculation of `` total '' entropy and energy to the local hubble - volume of the co - moving observer , we get @xmath342 and @xmath343 , where @xmath18 is the current value of the scale factor ( @xmath344 ) .",
    "this translates to @xmath210 , which predicts a temperature dependence @xmath345 , again exactly the temperature dependence that the co - moving observer experiences in his local minkowski frame .",
    "quite interestingly , the _ local _ thermodynamic properties of the _ interior _ holostar space - time can also be characterized by a different constant value of @xmath1 , which is tied to the viewpoint of a - most likely hypothetic - _ stationary _ observer at constant radial coordinate position @xmath18 . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown , that the holostar s total entropy and its temperature at infinity are exactly proportional to the hawking result if one calculates the local entropy - density and temperature in the ( @xmath346 ) coordinate - system , where the holostar space - time appears static . however ,",
    "unless @xmath119 the holostar s temperature at infinity @xmath347 and its total entropy @xmath66 are not related with the right factor .. for the holostar solution it is fairly easy to show that @xmath348 and @xmath349 , where @xmath350 is the gravitational mass of the holostar measured by an observer at spatial infinity .",
    "these dependencies are identical to the black hole case .",
    "it was not possible to establish whether the holostar s temperature and entropy are _ identical _ to the hawking result for a spherically symmetric black hole , because this would have required knowledge of the total number of ultra - relativistic degrees of freedom at the unification energy .",

    "it depends on the gut - model .",
    "furthermore , as the gut - scale is close to the string scale one expects a significant string - contribution to the total matter state .",
    "what one can show however is , that the thermodynamic identity @xmath351 , relating entropy and temperature in the _ exterior _ space - time , is only fulfilled if @xmath119 in the _ interior _ space - time ( or equivalently , if the free energy density in the interior space - time is zero ) . ]",
    "if the holostar - solution is to reproduce the hawking - result with the correct relation between @xmath43 and @xmath66 , @xmath1 must be unity in the _ interior _ space - time .",
    "this result is quite remarkable , as @xmath119 implies that the free energy @xmath121 be identical zero",

    "one possible solution is , that the relevant temperature for a stationary observer is not the radiation temperature ( seen by a geodesically moving observer who passes the stationary observer ) , but rather the temperature attributed to the local geodesic acceleration that is required to keep the observer stationary , i.e. his unruh - temperature @xmath354 .",
    "the geodesic acceleration in the stationary frame is proportional to @xmath355 , which quite clearly is not constant .",
    "however , if one transforms the proper geodesic acceleration to the frame of a geodesically moving observer ( with the implicit assumption , that this is the preferred local minkowski frame , to which all measurements should be referenced ) , one finds that @xmath356 , because the geodesically moving observer has a high @xmath357-factor @xmath358 and the proper acceleration transforms with @xmath359 . ]",

    "can the universe be described by a relation between @xmath66 and @xmath76 with @xmath191 ?    in order to answer this question one has to analyze the evolution of energy- and entropy - densities in the universe s different evolutional stages ( matter - dominated , radiation - dominated , etc . ) .",
    "quite clearly this analysis is model - dependent . in this section",
    "the analysis will be done in the context of the standard friedmann robertson - walker ( frw ) model for the universe , which is based on the so called cosmological principle . in the next section",
    "i will discuss a somewhat more exotic model of a flat , holographic universe .    in an homogeneously expanding space - time",
    "the expansion must be nearly adiabatic , as there can be no net heat flow into or out of a particular co - moving volume element in a homogeneous universe ( unless one assumes extra dimensions ) . with this assumption entropy",
    "is approximately conserved in any co - moving volume .",

    "the energy - density @xmath77 has the same behavior : @xmath364 ( unless we assume that particles are created or destroyed , violating local energy - conservation in a co - moving volume ) .",
    "therefore @xmath365 , which suggests @xmath119 . however , there is a slight difficulty in applying this finding to the framework developed so far .",
    "we have assumed a power - law between the _ total _ entropy and energy , which not necessarily translates to the same power - law for the densities . determining the `` total entropy '' or",
    "the `` total energy '' of the universe is tricky , if not impossible .",
    "we would have to multiply the respective densities with the `` total volume of the universe '' at a given time .",
    "this might not be well defined , particularly for an open universe , which can not be ruled out by today s measurements .",
    "yet there is an interesting observation : the product of the entropy - density ( which scales with @xmath366 ) and the `` volume of the universe '' ( which scales with @xmath367 ) is constant .",
    "the same applies to the product of the energy - density with the volume for the matter - dominated era .",
    "so we might still be able to relate the total ( constant ) entropy to the total ( constant ) energy of the universe , by calculating the ( finite ) ratio of the entropy to the energy in any finite co - moving region .",
    "this ratio is time- and position - independent for a matter - dominated frw - universe . as the ratio is the same for any arbitrary finite region , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath368 for the whole universe , even if its total volume , energy and entropy may be infinite .",
    "note also , that in a homogeneously expanding universe any one of its finite parts can be regarded as a closed system to a very good approximation , so that we can calculate the total energy and entropy for any large enough part without having to know what lies beyond .",
    "the relation found by this procedure will be valid for the whole universe , at least so far as the cosmological principle can be trusted .    with this somewhat debatable interpretation",
    "we find @xmath369 for the matter - dominated era .",
    "however , in the matter - dominated era the particles are not relativistic , so the formula for an ultra - relativistic gas can not be applied .    yet",
    "when we look far back into the past where the universe is expected to be radiation - dominated , an ideal gas of ultra - relativistic fermions and bosons should be a very good approximation to the thermodynamics in the very early history of the universe .",
    "can we attribute a sensible value to @xmath1 in this case ?",
    "assuming that the expansion remains adiabatic , we find that the energy density scales with @xmath370 and the entropy - density with @xmath366 .",
    "this gives us @xmath371 , which - naively - could be interpreted as @xmath7 .",
    "the problem is , that in the radiation dominated era the `` total energy '' in any ( finite ) co - moving volume element diverges ( @xmath372 ) , whereas the `` total entropy '' in the same volume remains constant .",
    "with respect to the total energy and entropy in a given co - moving volume element one would rather have to postulate @xmath373 , i.e. a non - constant value of @xmath1 which depends logarithmically on the temperature .",
    "this construct is highly problematic .",
    "it requires a maximum temperature , because for unbounded temperatures the ceiling @xmath172 would be exceeded .",
    "furthermore , the entropy can not be a function exclusively of the total energy .",
    "this would require @xmath1 to be a function of total energy alone , i.e. @xmath374 .",
    "but the `` constant '' of proportionality @xmath375 depends on the particular choice of the co - moving volume .",
    "unless there is a `` preferred '' volume element , such as the total volume of a closed universe , the choice of the correct co - moving volume is ambiguous .",
    "an interesting case is that of a homogeneously expanding flat ( @xmath376 ) universe with the additional assumption , that the matter in this universe strictly obeys the holographic principle .",
    "this means that the entropy in any space - time region does nt scale with volume , but with the area of it s boundary .",
    "if we denote the co - moving length by @xmath18 , we find the following dependence for the entropy in a holographic flat universe :    @xmath377    for the total matter in a holographic universe let us assume an equation of state of the following general form :    @xmath378    in the radiation - dominated era we have @xmath379 , in the matter - dominated era @xmath380 .",

    "the matter - dominated phase of the universe is nt too encouraging either : although @xmath368 in any co - moving volume , the particles are not relativistic .    however , there are situations in which both conditions might be fulfilled .",

    "therefore a holographic flat universe can fulfill both conditions , which are @xmath32 and an appreciable contribution of radiation to the total energy budget at high temperatures .",
    "another system , to which the results derived in this paper can be applied , is the so called holographic solution .",
    "the holographic solution , in short holostar , is an exact , static solution to the field equations with zero cosmological constant .",
    "it has been derived in @xcite and has been discussed extensively in @xcite .",
    "in fact the results presented in this paper are an offspring of the thermodynamic analysis of the holographic solution reported in @xcite , applied to a broader context .",
    "the essential difference between the holographic solution and the - hypothetical - model of a flat holographic universe with a string equation of state discussed in section [ sec : hol : univ ] , is that the holographic solution describes a _ locally anisotropic _ arrangement of strings with a well defined center and a spherically symmetric - but inhomogeneous - energy - density , whereas the model of a flat holographic universe is of the isotropic , homogeneous frw - type .",
    "it is not possible to discuss the holographic solution in detail in this paper .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the mentioned citations .",
    "here is a short summary of the results :    the holographic solution describes the most compact self - gravitating object possible , which is _ not _ a black hole .",
    "the holostar s properties are nearly identical to those of a black hole as seen from the outside , but very different from the inside . instead of the event horizon",
    "the holostar has a real physical boundary membrane consisting of pure tangential pressure and situated roughly two planck lengths outside of the holostar s gravitational radius .",
    "the membrane separates the singularity - free interior matter distribution from the exterior vacuum space - time .",
    "the tangential pressure of the membrane is exactly equal to the pressure of the - fictitious - membrane attributed to a black hole by the membrane paradigm .",
    "this guarantees , that the dynamic behavior of the new solution with respect to the outside world is nearly identical to that of a black hole of the same mass .",
    "furthermore , the membrane is situated at the global minimum of the gravitational potential .",
    "the interior of the holographic solution is non - singular .",
    "this makes it possible to describe the interior matter state by microscopic statistical thermodynamics .",
    "a very simple thermodynamic model discussed in @xcite is the assumption of an ultra - relativistic gas , which requires @xmath39 if the thermodynamic entropy of the holostar is to reproduce the hawking result .",
    "can also be shown for a matter - dominated holostar , if @xmath452 so that the entropy per massive particle @xmath86 .",
    "see @xcite . ] in the holostar space - time ( and in general for any thermodynamic system with @xmath8 ) the equation @xmath407 only has a solution , if there is _ at least one _ fermionic species present . if the gas consists only of bosons , there is no solution .",
    "this can be interpreted such , that the degeneracy pressure of at least one ultra - relativistic fermionic species is required to prevent the holostar space - time to undergo continued gravitational contraction to a singularity .",
    "the holographic solution has a very strong string character .",
    "therefore it appears not justified to interpret its interior matter state exclusively in terms of particles .",
    "if one interprets the interior matter state in terms of strings , one finds that the holographic solution describes a spherically symmetric , radial collection of strings , which are attached to the spherical boundary membrane .",
    "the strings are densely packed , in the sense that the transverse area surrounding each string is equal to the planck - area .",
    "the number of strings ( or rather of string segments ) attached to the spherical boundary area is equal to its proper area , measured in planck units .",
    "the same result applies to any concentric sphere in the holostar s interior , meaning that the number of strings puncturing any thin spherical concentric shell is proportional to the proper area of the shell . in the string picture",
    "it is very easy to see , that the number of fundamental degrees of freedom scales with area , not with volume .",
    "furthermore , if one takes into account that string theory predicts a minimum transverse area of the strings , the dense package of the strings in the holographic solution ( each separated by a planck area from its neighbors ) is the fundamental reason , why the holographic solution does not collapse to a singularity , although it s boundary lies only two planck lengths outside of it s gravitational radius .",
    "this argument is independent of the size of the holostar , so that arbitrarily large holostars approaching or even exceeding the size of the observable universe can be constructed , simply by laying out a sufficiently large number of strings radially .",
    "although the overall interior equation of state is that of a stringy matter , the holographic solution has a definite particle interpretation : the number of ultra - relativistic interior particles in the holographic solution can be shown to be proportional to the area of its boundary .",
    "this result only requires the einstein field equations , spherical symmetry , an interior matter - distribution @xmath453 and microscopic statistical thermodynamics of an ideal ultra - relativistic gas ( see @xcite for a detailed derivation and discussion ) .",
    "the holographic solution therefore can be seen as the most radical fulfilment of the holographic principle : the number of its ( interior ) fundamental constituents , be it strings or be it particles , scales with boundary area .. however , the entropy of a massive particle is equal to @xmath454 , as will be shown in the appendix .",
    "( at least this is the case when the chemical potential per temperature @xmath50 is small , which is to be expected , because the free energy for an ideal gas of non - relativistic particles is zero for @xmath455 . ) with @xmath456 the entropy of a matter - dominated holostar turns out @xmath457 . ]",
    "quite interestingly and unexpectedly , the holographic solution turned out to be an excellent description for many phenomena encountered in our universe today .",
    "geodesic motion of particles within the holostar space - time is practically indistinguishable from a homogeneously expanding frw - type universe at late times .",
    "a geodesically moving observer will experience an isotropic hubble - flow of massive particles in his frame of reference .",
    "the matter - density decreases with @xmath458 . within the local hubble - volume of an geodesically moving observer",
    "the matter - density is homogeneous by all practical purposes .",
    "the observer is immersed in a radiation - bath , whose temperature falls off over time with @xmath459 .",
    "the geodesic motion of photons preserves the planck - distribution , so the radiation remains thermal after decoupling .",
    "although the holographic solution has practically no tunable parameters , it fits the observational facts remarkably well .",
    "the overall string nature of the solution automatically leads to the prediction of unaccelerated expansion with @xmath460 , which is in very good agreement with the observational results .",
    "other non - trivial relations between the hubble length , the total matter - density , the cmbr - temperature and the hubble - constant can be derived , which are all fulfilled by the observations to an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "the most interesting fact about the holographic solution - from the perspective of this paper - is that it provides a promising alternative scenario for the matter - antimatter asymmetry in our universe .",
    "this scenario allows us to explain today s high value of the photon - to - baryon ratio in a very natural way .",
    "the crucial observation is , that in the holographic solution not the number - ratios of the different particle species , but rather their respective energy- ( and entropy- ) densities remain constant during the evolution .",
    "this points to a very different type of phase - transition at the time of nucleosynthesis and baryogenesis , as compared to the standard cosmological models :    today s observations show , that the energy - densities of photons electrons are nearly equal , within a factor of 2 or 3 . for any model of the universe we can extrapolate the energy - densities back to a time of the phase transition , which converted the relativistic electron - positron gas to a non - relativistic electron gas . in the standard cosmological model this extrapolation gives the result , that the energy density of the photons must have been a factor @xmath15 higher than that of the electrons shortly _ after _ the phase transition . from equilibrium thermodynamics",
    "we know that the number- and energy - densities of photons and electrons must have been _ nearly equal shortly before _ the phase - transition .",
    "thus the phase - transition produced a huge discrepancy between electron and photon numbers shortly after .",
    "the standard explanation for this phenomenon is a very small `` primordial '' asymmetry of the order @xmath461 between electrons and anti - electrons .",
    "however , this is an `` a posteriori '' explanation .",
    "so far we lack a theory which would allow us to predict the correct theoretical value of the asymmetry from first principles .",
    "if we extrapolate today s observed energy - densities back to the time of the phase - transition using the holostar model , we find quite a different result : the energy - density of photons and electrons are comparable , _ before and after _ the phase transition .",
    "this means , that instead of producing a great asymmetry in the number- and energy - densities of photons and electrons , the positrons dropped out rather smoothly during the phase - transition .",
    "it is quite clear , that such a smooth transition , which leaves the energy- and number - densities of the different particle species nearly unchanged , requires a rather _ large _ asymmetry between fermions and anti - fermions shortly before the phase - transition .",

    "the annihilation energy , which is roughly @xmath469 of the original energy , will be distributed among the remaining ultra - relativistic particles , which are photons and neutrinos .",
    "if the neutrinos have already decoupled from the radiation , all of the energy will go into the photons .    in thermodynamic equilibrium well above the threshold",
    "the energy - density of the electrons and anti - electrons is roughly twice as high as the energy - density of the photons for @xmath470 :    @xmath471    the annihilation diminishes the energy - density in the electrons by a fraction @xmath472 .    for simplicity",
    "let us assume that all of the annihilation energy goes to the photons .",
    "this would be the case if the neutrinos had already decoupled from the radiation .",

    "the ratio of the energy - densities of electrons and photons after the annihilation - process will be roughly given by    @xmath473    we find , that the energy - densities of electrons and photons are still comparable to each other after annihilation .",

    "a detailed calculation is expected to give corrections which might raise or lower the estimate by a factor of @xmath475 , but not vastly more .",
    "if the ratio of the energy - densities is conserved in the further evolution of the universe , as is the case for particles in geodesic motion within the holostar - solution , one gets the prediction , that the electron - density should be roughly a factor @xmath476 higher than the photon density today .",
    "the actual value appears to be somewhat lower : if we take the wmap values @xmath477 and @xmath478 and a proton to nucleon - ratio of 7/8 we get    @xmath479    this is a factor of 3 too low . on the other hand , the value of @xmath16 has been determined in the context of an frw - model .",
    "any such determination is model - dependent , as can be seen quite clearly for the case of the so - called `` dark energy '' . in order to explain the observations in the standard frw - models we require a significant dark - energy component @xmath480 , which is usually identified with a positive cosmological constant . in the holostar - model",

    "1 positron annihilates with 1 electron leaving 13 electrons behind . assuming that the annihilation proceeds in a quasi - equilibrium way , the equilibrium ratio of the energy - densities of electrons to photons before annihilation is roughly @xmath492 , after the annihilation roughly 1.3 .    in the holographic solution",
    "it is not the number - densities of the particles that remain constant during the expansion , but the energy- and entropy - densities .",

    "the baryon - to - photon ratio at the cmbr - temperature can be predicted .",

    "the simple thermodynamic model of an ultra - relativistic gas combined with the holographic solution allows us to construct a very different scenario of baryogenesis / nucleosynthesis , which proceeds from a profound - thermodynamically induced - matter - antimatter asymmetry to the nearly complete absence of anti - matter today . because the asymmetry was profound already at high temperatures ,",
    "the phase - transitions at the respective mass - thresholds of the particles proceed very smoothly , as the fraction of anti - matter that is annihilated at the threshold is quite small ( less than 8% of the total ) .",
    "this scenario has some experimental backing in today s observed baryon to photon number ratio .",
    "a straight forward task for future research is a more accurate calculation for the energy- and number - densities of the electrons and photons after the annihilation of the positrons at the electron mass threshold , taking into account all relevant interactions",

    "first , the hubble - rate at the nucleosynthesis temperature in the holostar universe is significantly higher than in the standard frw - models .",
    "a higher expansion rate shuts off the reactions converting d , t and he3 to the tightly bound he4 nucleus faster , so that a higher fraction of d and he3 will be left over . on the other hand , the baryon and electron number densities at the temperature of nucleosynthesis is higher than in the frw - models , which makes the conversion to he4 more effective .",
    "the higher density counteracts the faster expansion rate , so it is conceivable that nucleosynthesis in the holostar universe might produce results similar to the calculations based on the standard frw - model .",
    "when we have a good picture how nucleosynthesis proceeds in the holostar model of the universe , we might be able to decide whether the scenario for the matter - antimatter asymmetry presented in this work is worthwhile of further consideration , not only from a theoretical perspective , but from a very practical point of view .    10    ujjaini alam , varun sahni , tarun  deep saini , and a.  a. starobinsky .",

    ") system works internally , i.e. how the different `` types '' of energy add up .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is well known that self - gravitating systems , such as black holes , have an entropy which is directly related to the system s total energy ( in the case of a spherically symmetric black hole , its entropy is related to the square of the system s total gravitational mass ) .",
    "this observation ( as well as the principle of equivalence and the scale invariance of the theory ) suggests , that the entropy of any self gravitating system , including particles , should _ only _ depend on ( i ) it s total energy @xmath610 and ( ii ) the total energy s _ conjugate _ thermodynamic parameter , which is temperature . the temperature is required , because entropy is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "the only dimensionless parameter that can be formed from the total energy @xmath611 and the temperature @xmath43 is the ratio @xmath612 , so - on very general grounds - we expect this ratio to by the correct expression for the entropy per particle , irrespective whether the particle is compound or elementary and whether it is relativistic or non - relativistic .",
    "note that the proposed relation @xmath613 for the entropy per particle fits very well with the definition of entropy : assume that we have a ( compound ) particle with total energy @xmath78 residing in a thermal bath with temperature @xmath43 . now add some energy ( in the form of `` heat '' @xmath614 ) to the system and transfer this energy in a reversible process to the compound particle .",

    "however , the entropy of the particle must have changed as well according to the definition of the entropy : @xmath616 .",
    "there is nothing - in principle - that could prevent us to make the internal energy change as large as we want . in the ultimate limit @xmath617 .",
    "according to the equivalence principle this relation should hold in general , irrespective of the size or nature of any particle .",
    "there is an `` unwanted '' additional factor @xmath619 .",
