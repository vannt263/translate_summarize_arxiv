    "the generic principle of an emission trading scheme is based on the so - called ` cap - and - trade ' mechanism . in this framework ,",
    "an authority allocates fully tradable credits among responsible institutions . at pre - settled compliance dates",
    ", each source must have enough allowances to cover all of its recorded emissions , or be subject to penalties .",
    "a mandatory cap - and - trade system involves its participants in a risky business with an obvious need for risk management .",
    "that is , certificate trading is usually accompanied by a secondary market for emission - related futures , including a rapidly growing variety of their derivatives .",
    "their pricing is addressed in this work .",
    "our contribution focuses on a methodology between equilibrium and risk - neutral approaches . due to the complexity of emissions markets ,",
    "risk - neutral dynamics must be addressed in terms of explanatory variables , viewed as proxies of fundamental quantities .",
    "thus , we utilize equilibrium analysis to explain the role of fundamentals in risk - neutral allowance price formation .",
    "thereby , the key issue is a feedback relation between allowance prices and abatement activity .",
    "namely , we demonstrate that any increase in allowance price causes market participants to enforce emission saving in order to sell their allowances . hence , an increasing allowance price encourages a supply of certificates and lowers the probability of non - compliance , which tends to bring down their prices .",
    "apparently , the correct description of this feedback is the key to derivatives pricing .",
    "the present work focuses on this issue . on this account",
    ", our contribution goes beyond any risk - neutral approach to modeling of emission - related assets suggested in the existing literature to date .",
    "the literature on this subject is enormous : it encompass hundreds of books and papers .",
    "for this reason , we focus only on those market models which are relevant in the present approach .",
    "_ economic theory _ of allowance trading can be traced back to @xcite and @xcite , whose authors proposed a market model for the public environmental goods described by tradable permits .    _",
    "dynamic allowance trading _ is addressed in @xcite and in the literature cited therein .",
    "_ empirical evidence _ from existing markets is discussed in @xcite .",
    "this paper suggests economic implications and hints at several ways to model spot and futures allowance prices , whose detailed interrelations are investigated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "_ econometric modeling _",
    "is addressed in @xcite , where characteristic properties for financial time series are observed for prices of emission allowances from the mandatory european scheme eu ets .",
    "furthermore , a markov switch and ar  garch models are suggested .",
    "the work @xcite also considers tail behavior and the heteroscedastic dynamics in the returns of emission allowance prices .    _",
    "dynamic price equilibrium and optimal market design _ are investigated in @xcite . based on this approach",
    ", @xcite discusses the price formation for goods whose production is affected by emission regulations . in this setting , an equilibrium analysis confirms the existence of the so - called ` windfall profits ' ( see @xcite ) and provides quantitative tools to analyze alternative market designs . _ pricing of options _ was addressed only recently .",
    "the paper @xcite discusses an endogenous emission permit price dynamics within equilibrium setting and elaborates on valuation of european option on emission allowances .",
    "the paper @xcite and the dissertation @xcite deal with the the risk - neutral allowance price formation within eu ets . here",
    ", utilizing equilibrium properties , the price evolution is treated in terms of marginal abatement costs and optimal stochastic control . also , the work @xcite is devoted to option pricing within eu ets .",
    "the authors suppose that the drift of allowance spot prices is related to a hidden variable which describes the overall market position in allowance contracts and they make use of filtering techniques to derive option price formulas which reflect specific allowance banking regulations , valid in the eu ets . finally , the recent work @xcite presents an approach where emission certificate futures are modeled in terms of deterministic time change applied to a certain class of interval - valued diffusion processes .",
    "the present work brings aspects of risk - aversion into the line of research followed in @xcite and @xcite , which we briefly sketch now . within a stochastic model of an emissions market , a so - called _ central planer",
    "problem is introduced and discussed in @xcite . under additional assumptions ,",
    "the authors formulate this problem in terms of continuous - time stochastic optimization .",
    "furthermore , they provide economic arguments justifying why optimal control solutions correspond to an equilibrium of the emissions market . interpreting the allowance certificate price as the marginal abatement costs ,",
    "particular explicit solutions are discussed and yield a dynamic stochastic model for allowance price evolution .",
    "the work @xcite starts from the opposite direction . in a discrete - time framework ,",
    "the radner equilibrium of an emissions market is introduced and constructed via a solution of the central planer problem .",
    "the work @xcite yields an extension : in a slightly different setting , it is proved that any market equilibrium is reached by this methodology .",
    "thus , results from @xcite and @xcite show that a quantitative analysis of emissions markets is tractable in terms of stochastic control theory .",
    "however , this connection is valid only if risk aversion is neglected , in other words , under the assumption that _ each agent _ possesses a _ linear utility function_. losing sight of risk aversion comes at the costs of unrealistic results . among other singularities",
    ", it turns out that the equilibrium allowance price follows a martingale ( with respect to objective measure ! ) with the consequence that allowance trading can be arbitrary , only the final position must be adjusted accordingly .",
    "this work resolves all of these problems . starting from the no - arbitrage property which is satisfied in an equilibrium of a market with risk - averse players ,",
    "we show that the risk - neutral allowance price dynamics exhibits the above feedback property , which we formalize as a fixed point equation , discussing its solution .",
    "we show that for such a risk - averse setting , our fixed point equation plays the same role as the central planer optimal control problem for the non - risk - averse situation .",
    "namely , it provides a methodology to describe the market equilibrium in terms of _ aggregated quantities_. however , this description is valid only from the viewpoint of the so - called risk neutral dynamics , not being suitable for discussing all interesting problems .",
    "still , derivatives valuation is naturally addressed in , and can be obtained in , this setting .",

    ", cap - and - trade systems operate on multi - period scales , where unused allowances can be carried out ( banked ) into next period .",
    "further period interconnections may include a transfer of future allocation from the next into the present period ( borrowing ) and , in the case of non - compliance , a withdrawal of an appropriate number of credits from the next period allocation in addition to penalty payment . to complete the complexity ,",
    "let us mention that different emissions markets could be interconnected by acceptance of foreign certificates in the national scheme .",
    "emission trading in multi - period settings is addressed in , among others , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "mathematically , it reduces to the specification of a more complex penalty mechanism than that presented above . for this reason ,",

    "however , although equilibrium modeling in the spirit of these contributions is appropriate to investigate important questions of optimal market design , it has little to offer to the problem of derivatives valuation . with the present approach ,",
    "we intend to establish a reduced - form model which describes the evolution of emission - related assets from a risk - neutral perspective .",
    "we obtain a realistic picture by incorporating three essential assumptions into a risk - neutral model .",
    "these assumptions are shown to be direct consequences of an equilibrium situation :    a.   there is no arbitrage since , in equilibrium , any profitable strategy would immediately be followed by all agents .",
    "this would instantaneously change prices and exhaust any arbitrage opportunity .",
    "b.   the allowance trading instantaneously triggers all abatement measures whose costs are below allowance price .",
    "the explanation here is that if an agent possess a technology with lower reduction costs than the present allowance price , then it is optimal for that agent to immediately reduce pollution and take profit from selling allowances .",
    "c.   there are only two final outcomes for allowance price .",
    "either the terminal allowance price drops to zero or it approaches the penalty level .",
    "the reason is that at maturity , the price must vanish if there is an excess in allowances , whereas in the case of their shortage , the price will rise , reaching penalty .",
    "we believe that in reality , an exact coincidence of allowance demand and supply occurs with zero probability and can be neglected .",
    "let us formalize the above assertions ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) .",

    "the above proposition states that at equilibrium , the allowance price process @xmath71 follows a martingale with respect to an equivalent measure @xmath78 whose terminal value is @xmath79 obviously depending on intermediate values @xmath80 through abatement volume function @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "the surprising and far - reaching consequence is that , from a risk - neutral perspective , only cumulative market quantities are relevant . to see this ,",
    "define the overall allowance shortage @xmath83 which would appear in the market without any emission penalty .",
    "further , recall from ( [ volumefunction ] ) and  ( [ cfunt ] ) the cumulative abatement functions to express the risk - neutral certificate price dynamics in terms of the following feedback equation : @xmath84 although individual market attributes and actions of the different agents seem to be irrelevant in this picture , the reader should notice that this picture appears only from the risk - neutral viewpoint . in line with standard aggregation theorems ,",
    "the equilibrium market state heavily depends on , and is determined by , market architecture , rules , risk attitudes and uncertainty .",
