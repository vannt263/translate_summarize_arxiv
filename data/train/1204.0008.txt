    "in the past decades there has been an enormous effort , both theoretically and experimentally , in trying to understand the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking . within the standard model  ( sm ) ,",
    "the higgs mechanism provides a solution that demands the existence of a fundamental self - interacting scalar field , the higgs boson . after the analysis of significant amounts of data , the lhc and tevatron experiments seem to observe , for the first time , an excess of events that could be associated with a higgs - boson signal .",
    "if this excess is confirmed , a new set of questions will need to be addressed .",
    "in particular , it will be crucial to understand how the electroweak scale @xmath6 is related , if at all , to other scales in nature such as the planck scale @xmath7 .",
    "searching for a framework that provides a natural connection between these scales has been one of the main reasons to propose theories beyond the sm .",
    "some of these theories , such as supersymmetry , promote a perturbative extension of the sm up to scales close to @xmath7 .",
    "others feature new strong interactions and provide a solution valid only up to energies a few orders of magnitude above the weak scale , without necessarily specifying the ultraviolet ( uv ) completion of the theory .    in all cases ,",
    "new particles are expected to appear at or slightly above the tev scale to solve the naturalness problem of the higgs mass parameter .",
    "these new particles are expected to have non - negligible effects on the production and decay rates of the higgs boson . in the event of a higgs discovery ,",
    "any departure from sm expectations will then pave the way to probing models of new physics . from this perspective",
    ", precision higgs - boson physics  much like rare weak decays and flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes  is an exquisite tool for probing the structure of electroweak interactions at the quantum level .",
    "the couplings of the higgs boson to photons and gluons vanish at tree level in the sm , but they are non - zero at one - loop order and beyond",
    ". these couplings are therefore particularly sensitive to new heavy particles , which can propagate in the loops .    in this article , we concentrate on analyzing higgs - boson properties in models with a warped extra dimension , so - called randall - sundrum ( rs ) models @xcite , which represent a very appealing alternative to more traditional extensions of the sm , such as supersymmetry .",
    "these models provide not only a natural solution to the hierarchy problem , but also a very compelling theory of flavor .",
    "they feature a compact extra dimension with a non - factorizable anti - de sitter  ( ads ) metric and two four - dimensional ( 4d ) branes as the boundaries of the warped extra dimension .",
    "the ads background generates an exponential hierarchy of energy scales , so that the fundamental mass scale near the `` uv brane '' is of order @xmath7 , while that near the `` infrared ( ir ) brane '' is suppressed by an exponential warp factor @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the ads curvature and @xmath10 the radius of the extra dimension .",
    "while all fundamental parameters are of planck size , @xmath11 , due to the curvature of the extra dimension the fundamental scale of the theory near the ir brane can be in the range of a few tev .",
    "hence , as long as the higgs sector is localized near the ir brane , quantum corrections to the higgs potential are cut off at the few - tev scale and the hierarchy problem is solved .",
    "in addition , the large hierarchies observed in the spectrum of fermion masses and in the quark mixing matrix arise in a natural way from the localization of bulk fermions in the extra - dimensional space  @xcite .",
    "an important side effect of this mechanism is that flavor - changing couplings between sm fermions , which arise due to the tree - level exchange of kaluza - klein  ( kk ) gauge bosons , are suppressed by the same small overlap integrals that generate the fermion masses @xcite , a scheme referred to as the rs - gim mechanism @xcite .    in order to fulfill the constraints coming from electroweak precision data and fcnc transitions , the low - lying kk excitations of the sm particles must have masses in the range of a few tev , and hence may be out of the reach for direct production at the lhc . in recent years",
    ", many models have been proposed to alleviate these constraints and address the little hierarchy problem of the basic rs model with bulk fermions .",
    "the model building becomes rather involved and ranges from considering the effect of brane - localized kinetic terms for the gauge fields @xcite to enlarging the bulk gauge symmetries @xcite , thereby adding a whole new layer of additional matter fields .",
    "another class of models takes the higgs sector off the ir brane .",
    "this is particularly well motivated if the higgs boson is identified with the @xmath12 component of a gauge field ( `` gauge - higgs unification '' ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on studying the effects of kk excitations on the production of a sm - like higgs boson in the context of the simplest rs model containing bulk fermions and a minimal scalar sector localized on the ir brane .",
    "in particular , we will scrutinize the gluon - gluon fusion process , for which the presence of kk modes in loop corrections can have important effects",
    ". the type of considerations discussed in this work will also be relevant for the higgs - boson coupling to two photons , which is the other loop - induced coupling of the higgs field to gauge bosons . at present , the literature contains two sets of results for the computation of higgs production and decays in rs - type models that are at variance with each other . while in @xcite the authors find a significant suppression of the gluon - gluon fusion cross section relative to the sm , the authors of @xcite find an enhancement .",
    "indeed , when applied to the same model , the two groups obtain effects on the @xmath13 amplitude of approximately equal strength but opposite sign . in this article",
    "we revisit in detail both calculations and present alternative ways to derive them .",
    "for the first time , we obtain closed analytical expressions for both results in terms of the fundamental parameters of the model , valid to all orders in the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath14 and the typical mass scale @xmath15 of kk modes .",
    "we find that the calculations of @xcite are both correct from a mathematical point of view .",
    "the origin of their difference is related to a subtlety connected to the fact that , in order to compute its overlap with the fermion wave functions , it is necessary to regularize the higgs profile in an intermediate step by taking it ( slightly ) off the ir boundary .",
    "the difference between the results obtained by the two groups arises from the different orders in which the higgs regulator is removed and the sum over the kk tower is performed .",
    "we then show that the enhancement in the gluon - gluon fusion cross section obtained in  @xcite arises from very heavy kk modes . when the model is defined with a ( warped ) planck - scale cutoff so as to solve the hierarchy problem , the cross section is suppressed , in accordance with the result obtained in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : setup ]",
    "we define our notation and present the setup of the problem . in section  [ sec : leff ] we present the low - energy lagrangian for the effective @xmath13 couplings induced by the virtual effects of kk fermions , which is valid for energies below the kk mass scale .",
    "we also describe the setup of the two calculations , one summing first over the infinite kk tower and then taking the higgs regulator to zero , and the other considering the limits in the reversed order . in section  [ sec : azatov ]",
    "we perform the first calculation and reproduce the results of @xcite in a different way by using the five - dimensional ( 5d ) fermion propagator of the theory . in this way",
    ", we generalize the result to all orders in @xmath16 . in section",
    "[ sec : finitesum ] we perform the second calculation , considering first a simplified case , in which it is straightforward to obtain a closed answer for the sum over kk modes . based on symmetry considerations",
    ", we then make a conjecture for how to extend this result to the general case , which reproduces the numerical results obtained in @xcite . in section  [ sec : interp ]",
    "we explore in more detail the origin of the difference between the two approaches , which in rs models with an ir - localized higgs sector arises from unphysical contributions of kk modes with `` trans - planckian '' masses .",
    "we then argue in section  [ sec : cutoff ] that the use of a consistent uv regularization scheme , which for instance is provided by the physical uv cutoff inherent in rs models , eliminates these contributions , thus favoring the result corresponding to a suppression of the gluon - gluon fusion cross section .",
    "phenomenological implications of our findings for higgs - boson searches at the lhc are studied in section  [ sec : pheno ] , while section  [ sec : concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we work with the non - factorizable rs geometry @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 denote the coordinates on the 4d hyper - surfaces of constant @xmath19 with metric @xmath20 .",

    "the curvature parameter @xmath9 and the radius @xmath10 of the extra dimension are assumed to be of planck size .",
    "the warped planck scale @xmath25 sets the effective , position - dependent fundamental scale at a given point along the extra dimension .",
    "it serves as a natural uv cutoff , since quantum gravity would become relevant above this scale . in order to solve the ( big ) hierarchy problem",
    ", one assumes that the effective cutoff scale on the ir brane , @xmath26 , is in the range of 20tev or so .",
    "this requires that @xmath27 .",
    "the `` little hierarchy problem '' , the fact that the higgs - boson mass is two orders of magnitude smaller than the cutoff scale , is not addressed in the minimal rs framework .",
    "the warped curvature scale , @xmath28 , is assumed to lie somewhat lower , in the range of a few tev .",
    "it sets the mass scale for the low - lying kk excitations of the sm fields .",
    "for instance , the masses of the first kk photon and gluon states are approximately @xmath29 @xcite . it will be convenient to introduce a coordinate @xmath30 , which equals @xmath31 on the uv brane and 1 on the ir brane @xcite .",
    "we consider the minimal rs model in which all sm matter and gauge fields propagate in the bulk , while the higgs boson lives on the ir brane .",
    "the 5d theory contains three generations of massive fermions @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , which transform as doublets and singlets under the sm gauge group @xmath35 , respectively . the electroweak gauge symmetry @xmath36 is broken by the higgs sector on the ir brane .",

    "we use a compact notation , in which the profile functions of the left - handed ( right - handed ) interaction eigenstates that can mix into the left - handed ( right - handed ) components of the 4d mass eigenstates are collected in 6-component vectors @xmath62 .",

    "the precise shape of this function will be irrelevant ; however , it is important that the higgs profile is non - zero only within a small interval of width @xmath73 next to the ir brane , @xmath74 only if @xmath75 , and that it has unit area .",

    "we express this assertion by writing @xmath212 .",

    "these symmetries imply that the quadratic term in @xmath214 must indeed be of the simple form shown in ( [ conjecture ] ) .",
    "using symmetry considerations alone , we can however not exclude a dependence on the parameters @xmath80 starting at @xmath215 , provided that it cancels in the case of one generation .",
    "the discussion of the previous two sections shows that the calculations presented in @xcite and  @xcite are free of mistakes .",
    "the results for the effective @xmath13 couplings derived in these two papers differ , in magnitude and sign , because both groups considered different orders in which the limits @xmath86 and @xmath145 in ( [ doublelimit ] ) were taken , and the two limits do not commute . hence , the question poses itself which of the orders of limits is the more reasonable one from a physical point of view .",
    "we will address this question in section  [ sec : cutoff ] .",
    "a second , equally puzzling question arises once we realize that the non - commutativity of the limits @xmath86 and @xmath145 implies that the origin of the discrepancy between the results  ( [ satz ] ) and ( [ conjecture ] ) must be due to contributions from kk modes with large @xmath41 and hence very heavy masses , and related to the behavior of the profile functions for such modes very close to the ir brane .",
    "the fact that in both approaches one finds that the infinite sum over kk modes converges , signaling that heavy modes decouple , raises the question : how is it possible that modes with very heavy masses give an @xmath61 contribution to the sum , which is large enough to change the sign of the answer ?    in order to understand the physics behind this effect , it is useful to study a toy model that can be solved exactly also for finite @xmath76 . to this end",

    "[ sec : toy ] we derive the explicit forms of the bulk profiles for this toy model and the eigenvalue equation that determines the masses of the kk modes .",
    "we then present a formula for the sum @xmath219 entering ( [ doublelimit ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the nature of the solution differs depending on whether @xmath220 or @xmath221 , where we have introduced the abbreviation @xmath222 .",
    "the latter condition corresponds to masses @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is of order the weak scale , since we as usual assume @xmath225 in the anarchic rs model ( recall that we can choose @xmath195 real and positive ) .",
    "the appearance of the scale @xmath226 , which for very small @xmath76 lies far above the tev scale , will be of crucial importance to the resolution of the puzzle .",

    "we take @xmath229 .",
    "we observe that for low values of @xmath118 the sum quickly converges toward a value close to the result ( [ ours ] ) , which equals 0.701 in the present case .",
    "but then there is an intermediate region , roughly given by the range @xmath230 , in which the value of the sum changes by an @xmath61 amount .",
    "after this transition region , the sum converges to the value corresponding to the result ( [ satz ] ) , which equals 1.082 for our choice of @xmath231 . in order to understand the origin of the three regions  in particular the appearance of the intermediate region , in which the sum grows by an @xmath61 amount despite of the fact that the corresponding kk masses are extremely heavy  we show in the right plot the values of the yukawa couplings @xmath68 in our toy model ( for the case where @xmath232 ) . for low values of @xmath41 ,",
    "the couplings for each pair of kk states in the same kk level have equal values and opposite signs . in this case , like in ( [ toysum ] ) , the contribution from the @xmath203 kk level is @xmath233 in this region the sum over @xmath9 is convergent and dominated by the contributions from the first few kk levels .",
    "the situation changes drastically in the intermediate region , where the average coupling @xmath234 in each kk level , shown by the dark points in the right plot , no longer vanishes .",
    "there is thus a range of logarithmic growth of the sum , over which its contribution can be estimated as @xmath235 where @xmath236 denotes the mean value of @xmath234 in the interval @xmath237 $ ] , in which the average coupling in each kk level departs from zero . for even larger values ,",
    "the average coupling decreases quickly , giving rise to very small contributions to the sum .",
    "physically , the intermediate region arises because , for fixed @xmath76 , there exists a minimum kk mass @xmath238 beyond which the kk profile functions begin to penetrate the box modeling the higgs - boson profile .",
    "when this happens , the cancellation of the yukawa couplings of kk modes within one kk level is no longer operative . only for yet much higher kk levels , when the profiles exhibit a large number of oscillations within the box , the couplings average out to zero and hence decrease with increasing @xmath9 . while this behavior might seem strange at first sight , one should remember that by naive dimensional analysis the sum @xmath219 is logarithmically divergent for large @xmath118 .",
    "it is only due to subtle cancellations that it converges ; however , when the profiles penetrate the box these cancellations no longer occur , and the generic logarithmic growth arises .",
    "in order to decide which of the two calculations presented in @xcite and @xcite is physically more meaningful , we recall the importance of using a consistent uv regularization scheme when evaluating the gluon - gluon fusion amplitude . this is true in the sm , and even more so in its 5d extensions . here",
    "we will study two different regularization schemes : dimensional regularization and the use of a hard momentum cutoff . while a dimensional regulator is particular convenient in that it preserves gauge and lorentz invariance ,",
    "the second option is also a natural choice in the present case .",
    "this is because the rs model must be considered as an effective theory below the planck scale , which requires a uv completion incorporating the effects of quantum gravity .",
    "a peculiar feature of warped extra - dimension models is that the effective uv cutoff depends on where the theory is probed along the extra dimension @xcite ( see also @xcite for related works ) .",
    "the physical reason is that due to warping the fundamental length and energy scales change along the extra dimension .",
    "more specifically , the effective cutoff scale at the position @xmath82 in the extra dimension is of the order of the warped planck scale @xmath239 the cutoff should be sufficiently high that at least a small number of kk modes have masses below @xmath240 , and hence @xmath241 or so .",
    "otherwise incalculable `` threshold corrections '' of order @xmath242 become important and take away the predictive power of the model .",
    "we stress that imposing a uv cutoff is crucial in order for the rs model to provide a viable solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "quantum corrections to the higgs potential in the rs model exhibit an even stronger divergence than in the sm @xcite . however , as long as the higgs sector is localized near the ir brane ( i.e. , in the vicinity of @xmath70 ) , the effective cutoff @xmath243 is of the order of several tev , and hence the ( big ) hierarchy problem is solved .",
    "the question of how to introduce such a cutoff in practical one - loop calculations is far from trivial .",
    "however , at large loop momentum ( of order several times @xmath15 ) external momenta can be neglected , and hence there is a single 4d ( euclidean ) loop momentum @xmath244 on which the cutoff should be imposed .",
    "we propose to associate a @xmath82-dependent cutoff with every vertex of a feynman diagram .",
    "this can be thought of as modeling the effect of a form factor , which accounts for the impact of quantum gravity on energy scales above the effective planck scale at that point . in general",
    ", the @xmath245 coordinates of the vertices are integrated over the entire bulk ( @xmath246 ) , and hence the cutoff values vary between the tev scale and the fundamental planck scale .",
    "this is indeed an important effect , which makes gauge - coupling unification possible in warped extra - dimension models @xcite .",
    "the situation simplifies considerably for one - loop diagrams containing vertices with higgs bosons , such as the one in figure  [ fig : graph ] . denoting the coordinate of the two gluons by @xmath247 and @xmath248 and that of the higgs boson by @xmath249 , the fact that @xmath250 ensures that the momentum cutoff on the 4d loop integral is @xmath251 the same mechanism guarantees that the hierarchy problem is solved in rs models .",
    "it is well known that evaluating the triangle diagram in figure  [ fig : graph ] in the 4d theory requires a consistent , gauge - invariant regulator such as dimensional regularization , the reason being that the integral is superficially uv divergent .",
    "if one were to evaluate it in @xmath252 dimensions , then a momentum - independent term proportional to @xmath253 would appear , violating gauge invariance . in order to regularize the loop integral",
    "we thus evaluate it in @xmath254 dimensions , with @xmath255 , so as to regularize uv divergences .",
    "we then find that the sum in ( [ sigdef ] ) gets modified to @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the regularization scale .",
    "for very large masses @xmath258 , the dimensional regulator gives rise to a suppression , which renders the sum over kk modes convergent even for arbitrary @xmath61 yukawa couplings .",
    "the limits @xmath145 and @xmath86 can therefore be taken without encountering any ambiguities .",
    "the contribution from the dangerous intermediate region from super - massive kk modes with @xmath238 in figure  [ fig : surprise ] , which previously gave rise to an unsuppressed contribution of the form ( [ loggrowth ] ) , now receives an extra suppression factor @xmath259 , and vanishes when one takes the limit @xmath86 ( at fixed @xmath260 ) .",
    "the infinite sum then coincides with the result ( [ ours ] ) up to harmless @xmath261 corrections .    in the dimensional regularization scheme ,",
    "gauge invariance is manifest in the 4d theory . since the dimensional regulator also regularizes the infinite kk sum , we are guaranteed that the 5d theory remains gauge invariant , too . on the other hand ,",
    "dimensional regularization is perhaps not the most intuitive way in which to introduce a uv cutoff . as an alternative",
    ", we will therefore rephrase the discussion in a regularization scheme based on using the hard momentum cutoff given in ( [ eq : cutoff ] ) . in order to ensure 4d gauge invariance in this case",
    ", we first extract two powers of the external gluon momenta by taking appropriate derivatives , after which the remaining loop integral is superficially convergent . introducing the uv cutoff on this integral , and neglecting the higgs - boson mass compared with @xmath262",
    ", we obtain @xmath263 for small masses @xmath264 this reduces to the simple expression @xmath265 used in the sum ( [ sigdef ] ) .",
    "for very large masses @xmath266 , on the other hand , the uv cutoff gives rise to a strong suppression proportional to @xmath267 , implying that such heavy kk modes decouple rapidly .",
    "it follows that , due to physical reasons , the sum over kk modes in ( [ sigdef ] ) is effectively truncated once the kk masses exceed the scale @xmath240 . in the rs model with a brane - localized higgs sector ,",
    "the scale @xmath226 at which the high - mass kk modes start to contribute a positive contribution to @xmath219 with logarithmic growth is parametrically much larger than the effective cutoff scale @xmath240 .",
    "it is then appropriate to truncate the sum at a value @xmath268 corresponding to kk masses much smaller than @xmath226 .",
    "it follows that @xmath269 where the truncation error has the form of a threshold correction , which is always present in effective - theory calculations .    we can summarize the above discussion by emphasizing the subtle fact that , in order to obtain the correct answer for the gluon - gluon fusion cross section in the rs model , it is essential to employ a consistent uv regularization scheme when evaluating the loop integral , despite of the fact that this integral is convergent .",
    "when this is done , the convergence of the infinite sum appearing in ( [ doublelimit ] ) is improved in such a way that the order in which the two limits @xmath145 and @xmath86 are taken becomes irrelevant .",
    "specifically , in the two regularization schemes we have considered in our analysis , we find @xmath270     \\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\ ,          \\frac{v g_{nn}^q}{m_{q_n } }       \\left ( \\frac{\\lambda_{\\rm tev}^2}{\\lambda_{\\rm tev}^2+m_{q_n}^2 } \\right)^2       \\bigg|_{\\eta=0 }      \\!= \\sigma_q^{\\rm ( cghnp ) }      + { \\cal o}\\bigg ( \\frac{n_{\\rm kk}^{\\rm max}\\,v^2}{\\lambda_{\\rm tev}^2 } \\bigg ) \\ , .",

    "the first line refers to the dimensional regularization scheme , while the second line corresponds to employing a hard momentum cutoff .",
    "it would be instructive to rederive these results by means of a properly uv - regularized 5d loop calculation , rather than by regularizing the sum over kk modes , as we have done above .",
    "in such a computation , in which there would be no reference to individual kk states , one should find that the correction to the @xmath13 amplitude is of the form ( [ twoschemes ] ) once the regulator on the higgs - boson profile is removed ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "for the simplified case of one generation , we have convinced ourselves that this is indeed the case .",
    "details of this rather cumbersome analysis , as well as its extension to three generations , will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the terms suppressed by a power of the uv cutoff , which appear on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : threshold ] ) , parameterize the difference between the asymptotic value @xmath271 of the infinite sum and the sum over a finite number of kk modes .",
    "more generally , such threshold terms may also arise from the yet unknown effects of the uv completion of the rs model . from a low - energy perspective , the only requirement on such a completion that is relevant to us is that it must cure the hierarchy problem , by taming loop momenta exceeding the fundamental scale of quantum gravity . as long as this is the case",
    ", the gluon - gluon fusion amplitude will also be regularized in the way discussed above . in the context of a specific uv completion",
    ", the threshold effects could be modeled at low energies by means of a brane - localized effective @xmath272 operator , suppressed by @xmath273 .",
    "the additional factor @xmath274 reflects the high multiplicity of degrees of freedom in the low - energy effective theory . for quite generic reasons , the coefficient of this operator must contain the loop factor @xmath275 factored out in ( [ lhgg ] ) , even in cases where the uv completion of the rs model is strongly coupled .",
    "the reason is that the on - shell external gluons couple proportional to their qcd charges , and that any new heavy state that couples to the higgs boson must be color neutral , so it can not have a tree - level coupling to gluons .",
    "hence , a generic uv completion will indeed give rise to a threshold correction of the form shown in ( [ eq : threshold ] ) . the difference between the two sums ( [ ours ] ) and ( [ theirs ] ) , or the corresponding expressions ( [ funny ] ) and ( [ central_result ] ) , can however _ not _ be attributed to such a brane - localized threshold term .",
    "rather , it is related to the question whether a physical cutoff and a sensible uv completion are present at all .",
    "we now study the implications of our results for higgs - boson production in gluon - gluon fusion at the lhc .",
    "the master formula for the cross section has been given in ( [ sigmars ] ) , where the expressions for @xmath132 and @xmath276 can be found in ( [ kappav ] ) and ( [ kappas ] ) , respectively , while to an excellent approximation we can set @xmath277 . for the calculation of the wilson coefficient @xmath115 we use our central result ( [ central_result ] ) and assume that the parametrically - suppressed threshold effects appearing in ( [ eq : threshold ] ) can be neglected .",
    "note that the trace over a function @xmath278 of the matrix defined in ( [ xqdef ] ) is determined by the non - negative , real square roots @xmath279 of the eigenvalues of the hermitian matrices @xmath280 , i.e.@xmath281 since in the rs model with anarchic 5d yukawa couplings these matrices are structureless , the above result is proportional to the rank of the yukawa matrices , which in the case of the minimal rs scenario is equal to the number of fermion generations .",
    "in other words , the kk towers of all six quarks give comparable contributions to the effective @xmath13 vertex , irrespective of the mass of the corresponding sm fermion .",
    "we emphasize that this feature is not present in many other extra - dimensional extensions of the sm .",
    "for instance , in models based on universal extra dimensions the 5d yukawa couplings are hierarchical , like in the sm , and hence the higgs - boson couplings to light fermions and their kk excitations are strongly suppressed @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , in several gauge - higgs unification models , in which the higgs appears as a pseudo - goldstone boson , one finds that the contribution to the @xmath13 amplitude from the kk excitations of the sm quarks exactly cancels the dominant effect due to the corrections to the yukawa couplings of the sm quarks , leaving only chirally - suppressed corrections , which are very small for all quarks other than the top quark @xcite .",
    "hence , in these new - physics scenarios only the top quark and its heavy partners contribute to the effective @xmath13 couplings , while higgs - boson production is independent of the masses and couplings of the kk excitations of light sm quarks .    by randomly generating a large set of 5d yukawa matrices , which are required to satisfy @xmath282 and to correctly reproduce the wolfenstein parameters @xmath283 and @xmath76 of the unitarity triangle",
    ", we have found that to a good approximation the average result for the trace appearing in ( [ trace ] ) can be parametrized as defined in ( [ xqdef ] ) instead of the original 5d yukawa matrices @xmath60 . in practice , it turns out to be immaterial whether one considers @xmath60 or @xmath284 as random complex matrices . ]",
    "@xmath285 and @xmath286 .",
    "likewise , the parameter @xmath287 entering ( [ kappas ] ) can be approximated as @xmath288 where to an excellent approximation the contribution proportional to @xmath289 cancels in the sum @xmath290 appearing in the numerator of the expression for @xmath276 in ( [ kappas ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the very small effects due to @xmath139 and @xmath291 can be neglected for all practical purposes .         in the left plot in figure  [ fig : rh ]",
    ", we show our results for the higgs - boson production cross section in gluon - gluon fusion relative to the sm cross section , @xmath292 as a function of the mass of the lightest kk gluon state , @xmath293 .",
    "we use the lightest kk gluon mass as a reference , because its value is a model - independent prediction of the rs scenario .",
    "the masses of the lightest kk fermions have very similar values but depend to some extent on the bulk mass parameters . here and below we employ a higgs - boson mass of 125gev .",
    "the solid red , green , and light blue lines show the approximate results obtained from ( [ param1 ] ) and ( [ param2 ] ) employing the values @xmath294 , 1.5 , and 0.5 , respectively .",
    "the underlaid density plots indicate the distribution of the predictions for a large number of anarchic yukawa matrices @xmath60 , subject only to the constraint that their elements are smaller in magnitude than a given value @xmath295 .",
    "the fact that the regions of highest density in the scatter plots nicely reproduce the results obtained directly from ( [ param1 ] ) and ( [ param2 ] ) shows that the requirement to reproduce the correct values of @xmath283 and @xmath76 does not play an important role numerically .",
    "the contour plot displayed on the right in the figure gives a two - dimensional representation for the cross section as a function of @xmath296 and @xmath295 , obtained by employing again ( [ param1 ] ) and ( [ param2 ] ) .",
    "we observe from figure  [ fig : rh ] that @xmath297 is strictly below 1 and decreases ( increases ) with increasing @xmath295 ( kk scale ) . in other words , the minimal rs model with a brane - localized higgs sector",
    "predicts a depletion of @xmath298 relative to the sm . in the region where @xmath299 is a suitable expansion parameter",
    ", we obtain the approximate result @xmath300 where the constant term in parenthesis is due to the effect of @xmath132 . for not too small yukawa couplings",
    "this observable is dominated by the effects of kk quark loops . given the strong dependence of the ratio @xmath301 on @xmath295",
    ", we find that for @xmath302tev and yukawa couplings close to the perturbativity bound @xmath303 @xcite , the new - physics contributions to the higgs - boson production cross section in gluon - gluon fusion can become so large that they completely cancel the sm contribution .",
    "in fact , the sensitivity of @xmath301 to the overall size of the 5d yukawa couplings is even more pronounced than the one arising in the case of dipole - operator transitions such as @xmath304 @xcite . while the latter contributions also scale with @xmath305 , unlike @xmath301 they are ( at the one - loop level ) insensitive to the multiplicity of states in the fermionic sector of the rs model under consideration .",
    "this feature underscores our assertion ( made in the introduction ) that precision measurements of the higgs - boson properties furnish a superb tool for illuminating the quantum structure of electroweak interactions in rs scenarios .    in the minimal rs model considered here",
    ", constraints from electroweak precision observables @xcite and flavor physics @xcite require that the lightest kk excitations of sm particles must have masses in the 10tev range , which puts them outside of the reach for production at the lhc .",
    "figure  [ fig : rh ] shows that even in this case there can be significant virtual effects of kk particles on the higgs - boson production cross section , provided that the 5d yukawa couplings are not too small .",
    "the bounds from electroweak precision measurements , in particular , can be relaxed in several ways .",
    "for instance , `` little rs models '' , in which the size @xmath306 of the extra dimension is reduced @xcite , would only have a minor impact on our analysis .",
    "other extensions , such as models with a custodial @xmath307 gauge symmetry in the bulk @xcite , might however give rise to a rather different higgs - boson phenomenology @xcite .",
    "the announcements of the first direct hints for a higgs - boson signal by the lhc and tevatron experiments open up a new chapter in particle physics . although the significance of the various measurements is not yet sufficient to preclude the possibility of statistical fluctuations accounting for the observed effects , hopes are high that , with atlas and cms accumulating more data , a higgs boson will be discovered ( or excluded ) by the end of this year .",
    "this discovery would not only mark the birth of the hierarchy problem , but it will also reshape some of the fundamental questions of our field . in particular , the focus of large parts of the lhc physics program will shift towards determining the higgs - boson properties as accurately as possible , with the ultimate goal of probing possible deviations from the sm expectations . in close analogy to flavor physics ,",
    "precision higgs - boson physics represents a powerful way to investigate the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking at the quantum level .",
    "in fact , the couplings of the higgs boson to a pair of gluons and photons vanish at tree level in the sm , but are induced by the exchange of virtual top quarks and @xmath105 bosons at one - loop order .",
    "the effective @xmath13 and @xmath308 couplings thus offer a distinctive window to physics beyond the sm , where new heavy particles can propagate in the loops , thereby potentially affecting both the production cross section and the decay rates of the higgs boson .",
    "the main goal of this article was to perform an analytic calculation of the impact of kk fermions on the production of a sm - like higgs boson in the minimal rs scenario featuring an @xmath36 bulk gauge symmetry and a brane - localized higgs sector .",
    "in particular , we have revisited the gluon - gluon fusion process , for which two independent calculations previously found contradictory results .",
    "a significant suppression of the cross section was reported in @xcite , while in @xcite an effect of similar magnitude but opposite sign was obtained .",
    "as we have shown , the discrepancy is not due to a simple computational mistake . on a technical level , it can be traced to the fact that , in order to make the overlap integrals of the wave functions of the brane - localized higgs - boson with the bulk fermions mathematically well defined , a regularization of the higgs profile is unavoidable in an intermediate step of the calculation .",
    "it is achieved by smearing out the profile over a finite width @xmath76 , thereby moving the higgs boson slightly into the bulk . given that the yukawa couplings depend on @xmath76 , and that the calculations in @xcite both involve the summation over an infinite number @xmath118 of kk levels , the question arises whether the result for the @xmath0 amplitude might depend on the order in which the limits @xmath86 and @xmath145 are taken .",
    "we have demonstrated that the order in which these limits are performed indeed explains the aforementioned discrepancy .",
    "while the results of @xcite are reproduced if one first takes the limit of the higgs regulator to zero and then sums over the infinite tower of kk states , the findings of @xcite correspond to the reversed order of taking the two limits .",
    "we have presented for the first time closed analytical expressions for both results in terms of the fundamental parameters of the rs model , valid to all orders in the ratio @xmath16 of the higgs vacuum expectation value and the kk mass scale .",
    "we have then pointed out that the non - commutativity of the limits @xmath86 and @xmath145 is due to a hidden uv sensitivity of the infinite kk sum , and illustrated this phenomenon by means of a simple toy model , which can be solved exactly .",
    "this computation highlights that for fixed @xmath76 there exists a region , starting at around @xmath309 , beyond which the kk - fermion wave functions resolve the width of the higgs profile . as a result ,",
    "the subtle cancellation of the yukawa couplings of kk modes within each kk level , which is instrumental for the convergence of the kk sum , is spoiled",
    ". thus logarithmic growth of the @xmath0 amplitude kicks in , which continues until the kk fermion profiles exhibit a large number of oscillations within the region where the higgs profile is localized .",
    "excitations with kk numbers higher than @xmath310 quickly decouple , rendering the infinite kk sum ultimately convergent .    the question which of the two calculations of the gluon - gluon fusion amplitude gives the correct physics result",
    "is resolved by introducing a proper uv regularization scheme .",
    "specifically , we have studied the problem using dimensional regularization and using a hard momentum cutoff , which may be identified with the inherent uv cutoff of rs models set by the warped planck scale . in both cases ,",
    "the regulator improves the convergence of the kk sum and removes the unphysical , previously unsuppressed contributions from super - heavy kk modes . the regularized sum over kk states",
    "yields the result of @xcite , up to possible threshold corrections suppressed by inverse powers of the effective uv cutoff .",
    "this shows that higgs production is an uv - insensitive process in the rs model and can be calculated unambiguously once a proper regularization is employed .",
    "it would be worthwhile to reproduce our main result ( [ central_result ] ) for the induced @xmath13 vertex by performing an actual 5d loop calculation rather than an infinite kk sum .",
    "this is left for future work .",
    "we have finally studied the numerical impact of our results for higgs - boson production in gluon - gluon fusion , thereby extending our previous , more phenomenologically oriented analyses of higgs physics in rs models @xcite .",
    "we have reemphasized the important point that , regardless of the mass of the corresponding sm fermion , in warped extra - dimensional models the loop - induced couplings of the higgs field to gauge bosons receive similar contributions from the kk towers of each fermion state , and that these contributions scale with the square of the 5d yukawa couplings . assuming a similar kk mass scale , rs scenarios hence predict much stronger effects than many other extra - dimensional extensions of the sm , such as universal extra dimensions and models in which the higgs emerges as a pseudo - goldstone boson . while we believe this fact to be true in general , it is not unlikely that the structure of the corrections depends on the precise realization of the scalar sector .",
    "exploring the associated model dependence in more detail is left for future work . in order to probe the large effects predicted by our calculations",
    ", it would be particularly useful to measure the cross sections for higgs - boson production in both the gluon - gluon and vector - boson fusion channels .",
    "a combination of theses two measurements would allow for a clean extraction of the @xmath0 amplitude , and hence represents a unique way to study the yukawa sector of rs theories .",
