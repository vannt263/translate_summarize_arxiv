    "one of the key features of a granular gas is the tendency to spontaneously separate into dense and dilute regions @xcite .",
    "this clustering phenomenon manifests itself in a particularly clear manner in a box that is divided in a series of @xmath0 connected compartments , with a hole ( at a certain height ) in the wall between each two adjacent compartments .",
    "the system is vibro - fluidized by shaking the box vertically . with vigorous shaking the granular material",
    "is observed to be distributed uniformly over the compartments as in any ordinary molecular gas . below a certain driving level",
    "however , the particles cluster in a small subset of the compartments , emptying all the others .    for @xmath1",
    "the transition from the uniform to the clustered state is of second order , taking place through a pitchfork bifurcation @xcite .",
    "for @xmath3 it was recently found that the transition is hysteretic .",
    "it is a first order phase transition , involving saddle - node bifurcations @xcite .",
    "this difference has been explained by a flux model . in the present paper",
    "we will use the same flux model to construct the bifurcation diagrams for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "the main ingredient of this model is a flux function @xmath4 , which gives the outflow from a compartment to one of its neighbors as a function of the fraction of particles ( @xmath5 ) contained in the compartment @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath4 starts out from zero at @xmath6 and initially increases with @xmath5 . at large values of @xmath5",
    "it decreases again because the particles lose energy in the non - elastic collisions , which become more and more frequent with increasing particle density .",
    "so @xmath4 is non - monotonic , and that is why the flux from a well - filled compartment can balance that from a nearly empty compartment .    assuming that the granular gas in each compartment is in thermal equilibrium at any time ( in the sense of the granular temperature @xcite ) the following approximate form for @xmath4 can be derived @xcite : @xmath7 which is a one - humped function , possessing the features discussed before ( see fig .  [ fig-3 ] ) . in the above equation @xmath8 is the fraction of particles in the @xmath9-th compartment , normalized to @xmath10 .",
    "the factors @xmath11 and @xmath12 depend on the number of particles and their properties ( such as the radius , and the restitution coefficient of the interparticle collisions ) , on the geometry of the system ( such as the placement and form of the aperture between the compartments ) , and on the driving parameters ( frequency and amplitude ) .",
    "the factor @xmath11 determines the absolute rate of the flux , and will be incorporated in the time scale , which thus becomes dimensionless .",
    "the clustering transition is governed only by @xmath12 .",
    "the time rate of change @xmath13 of the particle fraction in the @xmath9-th compartment is given by the inflow from its two neighbours minus the outflow from the compartment itself , @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "here we have assumed that the interaction is restricted to neighboring compartments only .    for a cyclic arrangement",
    "the above equation is valid for all @xmath0 compartments ( with @xmath16 equal to @xmath17 ) .",
    "if we take non - cyclic boundary conditions , by obstructing the flux between two of the compartments , the equation has to be modified accordingly for these compartments .",
    "the total number of particles in the system is conserved ( @xmath18 ) , so @xmath19    statistical fluctuations in the system would add a noise term to eq .",
    "( [ eq - netflux ] ) , but we will not consider such a term here .",
    "so the present analysis has to be interpreted as a mean field theory for the system .",

    "the given matrix @xmath28 corresponds to a cyclic arrangement of the @xmath0 compartments .",
    "a similar matrix can be written down for the case of a non - cyclic arrangement .",
    "we will come back to this later , when we will see that most of the results for the cyclic arrangement carry over to the non - cyclic case .",
    "it is easily seen , from the fact that the elements of each row of @xmath28 sum up to zero , that @xmath29 is an eigenvector .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath30 physically reflects the fact that the compartments can not all be filled ( or emptied ) simultaneously : @xmath31 or @xmath32 . for future reference",
    "we note that all the other eigenvalues of @xmath28 are negative ( see appendix ) .",

    "iii we discuss the stability of the various branches in the diagram .",
    "section  iv discusses the physical consequences resulting from the diagram , in particular in the limit for @xmath33 .",
    "finally , section  v contains concluding remarks .",
    "the paper is accompanied by a mathematical appendix , in which some essential results concerning the stability analysis are derived .",
    "to calculate the bifurcation diagram , we have to find the fixed points of eq .",
    "( [ eq - ndot ] ) as a function of the parameter @xmath12 , i.e. , those points for which @xmath34 .",
    "so @xmath35 must be a multiple of the zero - eigenvalue vector @xmath29 .",
    "this tells us that , in a stationary situation , all components of the flux vector @xmath35 are equal : there is a detailed balance between all pairs of neighboring compartments .",
    "this rules out , for instance , the possibility of stable standing - wave - like patterns with equal but non - zero net fluxes throughout the system .",
    "the fixed point condition now becomes @xmath36    since @xmath26 is a one - humped function , @xmath23 has two solutions , which will be called @xmath24 and @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] ) .",
    "every fixed point can be represented as a vector with elements @xmath24 and @xmath22 ( in any order , and summing up to 1 ) corresponding to a row of nearly empty and well - filled compartments .",
    "let us call the number of well - filled compartments @xmath37 .",
    "apart from the ordering of the elements , every fixed point is then specified by only two numbers : @xmath22 and @xmath37 .    before actually calculating the bifurcation diagram ,",
    "it is convenient to replace the fraction @xmath5 by the ( also dimensionless ) variable @xmath38 , as then the flux  ( [ eq - grflux ] ) simplifies to @xmath39 .",
    "the fixed point condition eq .",
    "( [ eq - fixpoint ] ) then reads : @xmath40 so the @xmath12-dependence has been transferred from @xmath35 to the particle conservation , and this enables us to determine the entire bifurcation diagram from one single graph .",

    "in general , if a sumfunction @xmath58 has a minimum for a certain @xmath12 , the associated @xmath37 branch will have a bifurcation .",

    "there are two different regimes .",

    "@xmath91 ( at @xmath48 ) , the system is indifferent to infinitesimal changes .",

    "so , by straightforward physical reasoning we have reproduced the exact result obtained earlier from an eigenvalue analysis .",
    "the pitchfork bifurcation discussed at the end of section  iii is especially important for @xmath1 . in this case",

    "the hysteresis is maximal : the first saddle - node bifurcation takes place immediately after @xmath118 , and this means that there exists a stable @xmath63 solution over the entire range @xmath119 .",

    "the fact is that its lifetime may be exceedingly large , since the flux in the neighborhood of a peak and its adjacent boxes ( which are practically empty ) is very small .",
    "furthermore , the communication between the peaks is so poor that usually ( even for moderate values of @xmath0 ) the dynamics comes to a standstill in a state with peaks of unequal height .",
    "another point we would like to address is that practically the transition to a clustered state will take place already before @xmath48 , because the solution is kicked out of its basin of attraction by the statistical fluctuations in the system @xcite .",

    "( [ eq - grflux ] ) , but virtually everything remains true for other choices of this function , as long as it is a non - negative , one - humped function , starting out from zero at @xmath6 ( no flux if there are no particles ) and going down to zero again for very many particles ( no flux also in this limit , since - due to the inelastic collisions - the particles form an inactive cluster , unable to reach the hole in the wall anymore ) . any function with these properties will produce a bifurcation diagram similar to that of eq .",
    "( [ eq - grflux ] ) .    in the likely case that the range of @xmath110 is the same , extending from @xmath142 ( this value is attained in the maximum ) to zero ( in the outer regions of the flux function , for @xmath143 , @xmath144 ) , the bifurcation diagram will have the same number of saddle - node bifurcations and the same number of branches .",
    "the only things that change are the exact position of the bifurcation points , and the magnitude of the eigenvalues along the branches .",
    "slight differences in the diagram would occur if the slope of @xmath26 on the @xmath22 side was to become steeper than on the @xmath24 side . in that case , the bifurcation condition eq .",
    "( [ eq - bifpoint ] ) would also have solutions for @xmath145 , thus allowing saddle - node bifurcations for branches with @xmath145 .",
    "these branches , however , would certainly be quite unstable .",
    "in this appendix we present the analytical eigenvalues of the flux matrix @xmath28 [ introduced in eqs .",
    "( [ eq - ndot ] ) and ( [ eq - matr5 ] ) ] and discuss the eigenvalue problem for the jacobian matrix @xmath75 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq - jacobi ] ) ] , thereby determining the stability of the branches in the bifurcation diagram .",
    "first , we briefly treat the eigenvalues of @xmath28 . after that , we turn to @xmath75 . in subsection  2",
    "we discuss its zero - eigenvalues : one eigenvalue is identically zero and , by pinpointing the zero - crossing of a second eigenvalue , we reproduce the bifurcation condition eq .",
    "( [ eq - bifpoint ] ) . in subsection",
    "3 we determine the number of negative eigenvalues of @xmath75 in the low - driving limit @xmath102 .",
    "likewise , in subsection 4 we determine the number of positive eigenvalues in the ( mathematical ) limit @xmath146 .",
    "combining these two results , in subsection 5 , we finally find the number of positive eigenvalues of @xmath75 for general values of @xmath82 , and this gives the stability of the branches over the entire bifurcation diagram .",
    "the matrix @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - ndot ] ) is closely related to the @xmath147 tridiagonal matrix @xmath148 associated with the second difference operator known from numerical schemes for solving second order pde s .",
    "its eigenvalue problem can be solved exactly @xcite , and the same is true for @xmath28 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath28 are given by : @xmath149 where @xmath9 runs from @xmath150 to @xmath151 for @xmath0 even , and from @xmath150 to @xmath152 for @xmath0 odd .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors are : @xmath153 with @xmath154 and arbitrary coefficients @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "as we see , the first eigenvalue ( @xmath157 ) is zero and the corresponding eigenvector is @xmath29 .",
    "physically , this eigenvector represents simultaneous filling of all @xmath0 compartments , and the eigenvalue @xmath150 expresses the fact that this is prohibited ( because the number of particles in our system is conserved ) .",
    "all non - zero eigenvalues are negative and ( except the one for @xmath158 in the case of even @xmath0 ) doubly degenerate .",
    "this means that the corresponding eigenvectors span a two - dimensional subspace , reflected by the two terms @xmath155 and @xmath156 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - eigvec ] ) . since @xmath28 is symmetric , and therefore normal , linear subspaces corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal .",
    "especially , the eigenvectors of all non - zero eigenvalues span a @xmath84 dimensional subspace perpendicular to @xmath29 .",
    "the matrix @xmath159 for the non - cyclic case , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - matr5 ] ) , has a different set of eigenvalues : @xmath160 here @xmath9 runs from @xmath150 to @xmath84 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors are : @xmath161 just like in the cyclic case , the first eigenvalue equals zero , and all the others are negative .",
    "however , they are non - degenerate and the corresponding eigenspaces are one - dimensional .",
    "now we turn to the jacobian matrices .",
    "we consider the cyclic version @xmath75 , with components as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq - jacobi ] ) , but the results are also valid for the non - cyclic version .",
    "this matrix can be written as the product of @xmath28 and a diagonal matrix @xmath162 : @xmath163      first we note that the eigenvalues of @xmath75 are real , even though the matrix is not symmetric .",
    "this is a consequence of the following similarity relationship between @xmath75 and @xmath164 : @xmath165    this implies that @xmath75 and @xmath164 have the same eigenvalues , and hence they must be real . because @xmath28 is singular , @xmath75 must be too ( it has a zero eigenvalue ) and so its determinant @xmath166 is zero .",
    "more explicitly : @xmath167 where , for a fixed point with @xmath37 filled compartments , the product term equals @xmath168^{m } [ f'(n_-)]^{(n - m)}$ ] .    for the other eigenvalues we have to look at the characteristic equation @xmath169",
    "this is a polynomial expression in @xmath170 , of which the constant term is zero since it is equal to @xmath166 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath171 of the linear term is : @xmath172 where the matrix @xmath173 is the @xmath174 matrix obtained from @xmath75 by deleting its @xmath9-th row and its @xmath9-th column . in the right - hand side of this equation ,",
    "the only product that survives is the one that does not contain the trivial ( zero ) eigenvalue .",
    "so : @xmath175 alternatively , the determinant of @xmath173 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - app2 ] ) can be written in terms of @xmath176 , by deleting the @xmath9-th factor from the product in eq .",
    "( [ eq - app1 ] ) : @xmath177    it can be shown that for all @xmath9 the determinant @xmath176 is a constant , @xmath178 , which equals @xmath179 in the cyclic , and @xmath180 in the non - cyclic case .",
    "thus , eq .",
    "( [ eq - app4 ] ) reduces to : @xmath181    for a fixed point with @xmath37 filled compartments , we can write ( using that in the above summation each of the products misses either an @xmath79 or an @xmath80 ) : @xmath182^{(m-1)}[f'(n_-)]^{(n - m-1 ) } \\times \\\\ & \\quad \\quad \\quad \\big (   ( n - m ) f'(n_+ ) - m    f'(n_- ) \\big ) \\\\   & = c [ f'(n_+)]^{(m-1 ) } [ f'(n_-)]^{(n - m ) } \\big ( ( n - m)\\sigma - m   \\big ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this equation we conclude that @xmath171 becomes zero at @xmath183 .",
    "this is exactly the bifurcation condition already given in the main text [ eq .",
    "( [ eq - bifpoint ] ) ] . also , with eq .",
    "( [ eq - app3 ] ) , we see that an eigenvalue crosses zero at this value of @xmath82 .",
    "[ [ number - of - negative - eigenvalues - of - mathbfj - for - sigma - to-0 ] ] number of negative eigenvalues of @xmath75 for @xmath102 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    we now come to the next step in determining the number of positive eigenvalues .",
    "we again use the definition of @xmath82 to write : @xmath185 , where @xmath186 . the factors @xmath127 correspond to the @xmath81 nearly empty boxes and the factors @xmath82 to the @xmath37 filled boxes .",
    "the precise ordering of the factors is not essential for the following argument , so we may choose the above order for notational convenience .",
    "the factor @xmath80 is always positive , so we only have to deal with @xmath187 . note that only @xmath188 depends on @xmath82 and that in the limit @xmath102 this matrix becomes as @xmath189 are @xmath190 mappings ( from @xmath191 and @xmath192 respectively , where @xmath193 is the space of polynomials of order @xmath0 ) , it is allowed to take the limits @xmath194 and @xmath195 , even though the latter does not occur in practice . ] : @xmath196    @xmath197 is a projection matrix which projects @xmath198 to the subspace spanned by the first @xmath81 unit vectors .",
    "it is obviously non - singular , symmetric , and applying it twice gives the same result as once : @xmath199 .    instead of taking the matrix @xmath200 as input for solving our eigenvalue problem ( in the limit @xmath194 )",
    ", we will rather look at the matrix @xmath201 which is symmetric and has the same eigenvalues as @xmath202 .    for proof of the last statement ,",
    "let @xmath203 be a ( non - zero ) eigenvalue of @xmath202 : @xmath204 .",
    "then : @xmath205 .",
    "note that @xmath206 , because otherwise also @xmath207 would be zero , contradicting the assumption that @xmath203 is non - zero .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "the matrix @xmath28 is negative semi - definite .",
    "this means that @xmath28 has only negative or zero eigenvalues or , equivalently , the inner product @xmath208 for all @xmath209 .",
    "this means that also @xmath201 is negative semi - definite , because : @xmath210 in conclusion , @xmath202 has negative and zero eigenvalues only .",
    "proof : note that the image @xmath212 of @xmath197 is spanned by the first @xmath37 unit vectors of @xmath198 .",
    "its kernel @xmath213 is spanned by the remaining @xmath81 unit vectors . since the kernel of @xmath28 is spanned by the vector @xmath214 ,",
    "the following identities hold :        now , for all @xmath217 it holds that @xmath218 , so @xmath219 . on the other hand , for all @xmath220 one has @xmath221 , with @xmath222 , and therefore @xmath223 because of eq .",
    "( [ eq - app10b ] ) .",
    "this means that @xmath224 , and thus @xmath225 .",
    "together these two results prove that @xmath226 , so obviously the rank of the two matrices must be equal .",
    "since @xmath227 , this is also the rank of @xmath202 , which completes the proof .",
    "we now turn to the limit @xmath228 . in this limit",
    "we rewrite @xmath75 as follows : @xmath229 . here",
    "@xmath230 , which in the limit @xmath228 becomes : @xmath231 again , @xmath232 is a projection matrix , which now projects @xmath198 to the subspace spanned by the last @xmath37 unit vectors , so @xmath232 is complementary to @xmath197 .",
    "following the same line of reasoning , but keeping in mind that now the constant factor in front of @xmath233 is negative , we find that in the limit @xmath228 , the matrix @xmath75 has @xmath37 _ positive _ eigenvalues .",
