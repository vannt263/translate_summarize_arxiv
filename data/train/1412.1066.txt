    "in natural environments , individuals have to choose among a variety of evolutionary strategies , characterized by different payoffs and risks , which , in their turn , may change with time . particularly relevant",
    "is the case in which a choice is to be made between a relatively safe strategy , with a low but stable payoff , and a potentially very productive , but risky , variable strategy .",
    "micro - organisms able to metabolize two resources @xcite , one of them consistently available at a fixed though low level , and the second , more abundant on average but fluctuating in time , constitute an example of this . in the absence of specific knowledge about environmental conditions ,",
    "individuals need to make a blind decision about whether to specialize in consuming only one resource or , instead , develop a hybrid `` bet - hedging '' strategy by alternating both options .",
    "similar forms of bet - hedging can also emerge in cases where limited information from sensory systems is available @xcite .",
    "finally , bet - hedging can be exploited at a community level rather than on an individual basis by developing , for example , phenotypic variability among individuals in a population@xcite .",
    "the concept of bet - hedging was first formalized in the context of information theory @xcite and portfolio management @xcite .",
    "later , it was conjectured that living organisms may employ bet - hedging strategies to decrease their risk in unpredictable environments @xcite .",
    "this idea has been empirically confirmed in bacterial and viral communities @xcite , in insects @xcite , in seed - dispersal strategies developed by plants @xcite , and in a wealth of other examples in population ecology , microbiology , and evolutionary biology @xcite .",
    "given their ubiquity , bet - hedging strategies have attracted a lot of interest from the perspective of evolutionary game theory @xcite . an interesting and nontrivial result in this context",
    "is the so - called parrondo s paradox @xcite , in which an alternation of two `` losing '' strategies can lead to a `` winning '' one .",
    "however , most of the existing theoretical studies of this effect , including applications in population dynamics @xcite , rely on mean - field analyses describing well - mixed communities .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to extend previous approaches and to show that the competitive advantage of bet - hedging hybrid strategies is much stronger in the presence of highly variable environments and/or in low - dimensional systems , where the effect of fluctuations , i.e. , demographic noise , is maximal and mean - field predictions do not hold .    for this , we study a minimal mathematical model of bet - hedging .",
    "it is based on the physics of the contact process ( cp ) @xcite , but with the twist that individuals can randomly choose between two strategies : one characterized by a fixed reproduction rate and the other by fluctuating environmental - dependent rates . by combining analytical and computational results , we conclude that bet - hedging benefits are greatly enhanced in noisy low - dimensional environments such as the ones that living systems typically inhabit and end by discussing the relevance of our results for more realistic models of biological populations .",
    "our starting point is the simplest possible birth - death stochastic model on a lattice , i.e. , the cp @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cp_graphical ] , left ) .",
    "individuals occupy a ( square ) lattice or network , with at most one individual per site . at every discrete time step ,",
    "each individual can either produce ( with probability @xmath0 ) an offspring at a randomly chosen neighboring site provided it is empty or die and be removed from the system ( with probability @xmath1 ) .",
    "this simple dynamics can depending on the value of @xmath0 either generate an active phase characterized by a nonvanishing density of individuals or , alternatively , lead ineluctably to the absorbing state in which the population becomes extinct .",
    "a critical point , @xmath2 , separates these two distinct phases @xcite .",
    "we consider a variant of the cp dynamics in which individuals can choose between two strategies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cp_graphical ] , right ) : a `` conservative '' one , corresponding to exploitation of a constantly available resource , and a `` risky '' one , exploiting a variable / unpredictable resource .",
    "the conservative strategy corresponds to a cp in which @xmath0 is kept constant at a relatively low value , @xmath3 . on the other hand , in the risky strategy",
    ", demographic probabilities depend upon variable external conditions , i.e. , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a random noise , common to all individuals in the community .",
    "we focus on the simple case in which @xmath5 is freshly drawn at every ( monte carlo ) time step , and discuss later the case in which the environment is temporally correlated .     at a random neighboring site ( provided it is empty ) or ( ii )",
    "is removed from the lattice with complementary probability @xmath1 .",
    "right : contact process with hybrid dynamics : at each time step , every individual chooses between the conservative ( with probability @xmath6 ) and the risky ( with probability @xmath7 ) spreading strategy .",
    "the conservative dynamics is characterized by a constant , relatively low spreading probability @xmath3 , while the risky one depends on a stochastic variable @xmath5 , common to all particles in the system . ]",
    "individuals can hedge their bets by randomly picking either of the two competing strategies at each time step .",
    "this choice is controlled by the `` risk parameter '' @xmath7 : at each time step , each individual independently adopts the risky strategy with probability @xmath7 or the conservative one with probability @xmath6 . in the language of game theory , @xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to `` pure strategies '' and the range @xmath10 corresponds to a set of hybrid strategies . in what follows",
    ", we assume that all individuals in the community are characterized by the same value of the risk parameter @xmath7 ; variations in which @xmath7 is individual - dependent are left for a future work .",
    "key observables are the stationary density of individuals , @xmath11 , the averaged ( exponential ) growth rate , @xmath12 , and the mean extinction time of small populations , @xmath13 ( see below ) .",
    "in game theory , it is known that a hybrid plan consisting in the alternation of two distinct pure strategies can outperform both of them ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , constituting an example of parrondo s paradox .",
    "this effect plays an important role for our aims in what follows . in this section",
    ", we discuss a simplified one - variable equation aimed at capturing the gist of our model .",
    "in particular , the simplifying assumptions we make here are as follows : ( i ) we consider a mean - field limit in which spatial fluctuations are neglected .",
    "( ii ) we neglect nonlinear saturation terms ; this is a valid approximation only for low densities .",

    "the choice of a gaussian probability distribution function for @xmath5 enables us to obtain analytical calculations , but it has some `` technical '' drawbacks . in particular , being an unbounded distribution , @xmath5 can take negative values ; thus , in order to avoid interpretation problems , we need to restrict ourselves to the case @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where these effects should be negligible . in any case , even if specific details may depend on this choice , the general results and conclusions presented in what follows are robust against changes in this probability .",
    "this is explicitly illustrated in appendix a for the case of uniform bounded distributions .    under these assumptions ,",

    "[ fig : diagram ] ) in which both pure strategies , @xmath3 and @xmath34 , are subcritical .",
    "similarly , when the two pure strategies are active / supercritical , the same argument shows that a much higher stationary density can be achieved by hybrid strategies .",
    "this graphical representation which we believe is new in the literature allows us to understand in a relatively simple and compact way the essence of parrondo s paradox . in what follows ,",
    "we consider different types of pure strategies , either absorbing / subcritical or active / supercritical , and quantify the gain induced by bet - hedging in different settings , including fully connected ( fc ) networks ( where the above mean - field approach should hold ) and spatially explicit low - dimensional systems ( where mean - field conclusions might break down ) .",
    "the calculation in the previous section provides valuable insight into why hybrid strategies can be important , but it has some important limitations .",
    "it is a mean - field calculation , thus neglecting spatial structure .",
    "moreover , eq . ( [ basic2 ] )",
    "includes only linear terms , and thus it can only describe exponential growth starting from low density rather than the steady - state behavior of the nonlinear dynamics . to go beyond these limitations , here we perform direct monte carlo simulations of the discrete model defined in sec .",
    "[ model ] in large fc networks , and later we compare them with similar simulations in one - dimensional ( 1d ) two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) lattices .",
    "we implemented the cp dynamics using either synchronous / parallel or asynchronous / sequential types of updatings . here",
    ", we mostly focus on the synchronous case . in appendix b , we show that asynchronous updating leads to qualitatively similar results , even if quantitative differences emerge .    simulations are initialized with a fully occupied configuration ; then the dynamics proceeds as follows : ( i ) at every step , a new value of @xmath5 is drawn from some probability distribution in @xmath56 $ ] ; in most of this paper we use a truncated gaussian @xmath57 ( @xmath15 and @xmath58 are the mean and variance , respectively , of the nontruncated distribution ) in which we fix possible values @xmath59 to @xmath60 and values @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "this particular choice may seem arbitrary , but we have verified that all the forthcoming conclusions are robust and remain valid for , e.g. , uniform distributions .",

    "( iii ) each individual either dies or reproduces with the corresponding probabilities ; all dying individuals are removed from the system and afterward offspring are placed at random neighbors of their corresponding parents , keeping the constraint of a maximum occupancy of one individual per site ( i.e. , offspring trying to occupy an already full site are simply removed ) .",
    "finally , ( iv ) time is incremented in one unit and the process is iterated until a stationary state has been reached and steady - state measurements ( of , e.g. , @xmath11 ) are performed .",
    "we begin by verifying the possibility of obtaining an active phase by combining two strategies , each of them leading to an absorbing / subcritical phase . to this aim , we fix the parameters @xmath63 to poise the respective pure strategies ( @xmath8 or @xmath64 ) in the absorbing phase and study the behavior of hybrid strategies at intermediate values of @xmath7 .",
    "to determine whether or not a strategy leads to an active phase , we measure the mean extinction time , @xmath13 , as a function of the system size @xmath65 .",
    "observe that , owing to fluctuations , any finite system is condemned to end up in the absorbing state .",

    "we therefore conclude that in the cp the stochastic alternation of two absorbing dynamics can lead to an active one , in agreement with the linear - approximation above .     for different strategies @xmath7 and spatial dimensions . for our parameter choice ,",

    "some remarks are in order .",
    "the advantageous consequences of bet - hedging are not limited to the mean - field case , which can be simply interpreted in terms of eq .",

    "we discuss later a way to compare more clearly the strength of the effect as the system dimensionality is changed .",
    "finally , we have made no attempt here to accurately determine the values of @xmath7 delimiting the active phase for each dimension , but have just confirmed the stabilizing effect of hybrid strategies .",
    "the goal now is to quantitatively analyze how the benefits of bet - hedging depend on the level of stochasticity , both external ( environmental ) and intrinsic ( demographic ) .",
    "first , we study the dependence on environmental variability @xmath58 . to ease comparison , for each value of @xmath58",
    ", we fix the two pure strategies to have the same steady - state density , @xmath75 , by an appropriate choice of the only remaining free parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath34 , respectively . observe that , at variance with the previous section , here the pure strategies",
    "are taken to be `` equally '' active ( same steady - state density ) , but we could have also taken them to be equally absorbing ( same extinction time ) .",
    "the reason for this choice is that it allows for a much faster and easier computational implementation .",
    "we then analyze how the steady - state averaged density @xmath11 depends on @xmath7 for different values of @xmath58 .",

    "so far , we have not attempted to determine the optimal strategy @xmath94 for each case , but just to confirm the gain enhancement of bet - hedging in the presence of larger fluctuations .",
    "a main feature of low - dimensional models in statistical mechanics is that intrinsic fluctuations ( or _ demographic _ stochasticity , in the language of population dynamics ) play a more dramatic role than they do in high dimensions @xcite , where they can be safely neglected in mean - field - like approximations .",
    "we assume and then explicitly verify that smaller spatial dimensions effectively correspond to larger levels of demographic noise .",
    "we now explore the effect of dimensionality on bet - hedging ; the spatial dimension of the systems is varied while keeping a fixed external noise variance @xmath58 .",
    "as above , to ease comparison , we choose pure strategies for each dimension so that @xmath97 ( i.e. , both pure strategies are equally active ) and measure computationally @xmath98 as a function of @xmath7 for hybrid strategies in each dimension .",

    "a much more detailed analytical characterization of bet - hedging dynamics under correlated environments is left for a future study .",
    "summarizing , our main finding is that the relative benefit of developing bet - hedging strategies is strongly enhanced in highly fluctuating low - dimensional systems , where both internal and external sources of variability greatly foster dynamical fluctuations , leading to a strong departure from mean - field behavior . given that these conditions are often met by biological populations as for instance , in bacterial colonies competing at the front of a range expansion in noisy environments @xcite our results support the importance of bet - hedging in nature .",
    "this being said , of course , more realistic models including some realistic ingredients such as , for example , the possibility of `` dormant '' states and not just birth and death processes would be required to approach viral or bacterial communities and their bet - hedging more closely .",
    "the kind of trade - off considered in this paper , between a stable and a fluctuating resource , is possibly the simplest example of bet - hedging , both biologically relevant and natural to understand using tools of nonequilibrium statistical physics .",

    "our preliminary results presented in appendix c show that the effect described in this paper is still present in correlated environments .",
    "however , for very long correlation times , bet - hedging strategies are disfavored compared to short - correlated environments , but they always provide an advantage with respect to pure strategies . in view of these preliminary results , it will be of interest to investigate from a general perspective and in more depth the influence of environmental - noise temporal autocorrelations on bet - hedging , as well as the difference between exploiting bet - hedging individually and exploiting it at a community level .",
    "we believe that this work will provide a physical framework to answer these and similar challenging questions which might be of interest in biology and ecology .",

    "observe that one could have naively expected that fluctuations derived from the sequential updating might contribute to an enhancement of the density for such hybrid strategies .",
    "this difference stems from the fact that in the sequential implementation of the model , not all individuals are necessarily updated at every single monte carlo step ; thus the stochasticity introduced by this type of updating may save populations from extinctions in very unfavorable environments .",

    "( iii ) when the autocorrelation is very large ( @xmath196 ) , the benefits of hybrid strategies are reduced compared to the noncorrelated case , but they always remain convenient with respect to pure strategies . however , we are not interested in this scenario , in which external conditions remain almost unchanged during extremely long periods of time , and thus it behaves , effectively as a constant-@xmath0 case . the inflection point in @xmath170",
    "at which this effect appears varies for different dimensions .",
    "( iv ) finally , the optimal strategy becomes more conservative when temporal correlations are added to the environment , with a bias to @xmath197 when @xmath170 decreases .",
