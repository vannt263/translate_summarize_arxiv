    "observations of large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite and cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite indicate that the universe is highly homogenous and isotropic on large scales . under standard assumptions on the matter",
    "content , in the standard general relativistic cosmological models isotropy is a special feature , requiring a high degree of fine tuning ( a special set of initial conditions ) in order to reproduce the observed universe .",
    "specifically , in the set of spatially homogeneous cosmological models with a fluid which satisfy the energy conditions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , those which approach isotropy at late times is of measure zero  @xcite . in these models",
    "the anisotropy dominates the dynamics in the neighborhood of the singularity , while the effect of matter is negligible : thus the singularity can be said to be velocity dominated @xcite . in general anisotropic models do not isotropize sufficiently as they evolve into the future ( models do not evolve towards a friedmann - robertson - walker universe rapidly enough ) .",
    "this problem is known as the isotropy problem and can be solved by inflation .",
    "many investigations on this issue show that a large class of models evolve towards a homogenous and isotropic model when under the influence of inflationary matter .",
    "this means that even models with initially high levels of anisotropy can evolve into the universe we observe today .",
    "a large body of work exists relating specifically to the study of spatially homogenous and anisotropic bianchi cosmological models . in a classical paper ,",
    "wald showed that initially expanding bianchi models with a cosmological constant asymptotically approach a de  sitter state ( hence a spatially homogenous and isotropic model ) , except for the bianchi type ix mixmaster models which may re - collapse  @xcite . in the case of inhomogeneous models",
    "it is not so clear cut and in order for inflation to begin , sufficiently homogenous initial conditions are required ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . as far as singularities in general relativity",
    "are concerned , it is widely accepted @xcite that the belinskii , khalatnikov and lifshitz ( bkl ) @xcite picture is correct : for fluids with linear eos @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) or scalar fields ( @xmath6 ) and are special in this respect , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "] , when the singularity of generic inhomogeneous anisotropic cosmological models is approached , the dynamics is asymptotically that of the mixmaster model , the singularity is thus velocity dominated and the effect of matter is negligible @xcite .",
    "more recently various theories of gravity that go beyond general relativity have been considered .",
    "for instance , high energy modifications of gravity could come from extra dimensions ( as required in string theory ) . in the brane world",
    "@xcite scenario the extra dimensions produce a term quadratic in the energy density in the 4-dimensional effective energy - momentum tensor , i.e.  this quadratic term appears in the 4-d evolution and constraint equations on the brane . under the reasonable assumption of neglecting 5-d weyl tensor contributions in these equations , this quadratic term has the very interesting effect of suppressing anisotropy at early enough times , as the singularity is approached . in the case of a bianchi",
    "i brane - world cosmology containing a scalar field with a large kinetic term the initial expansion is quasi - isotropic  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the initial anisotropy provides increased damping in the scalar field equation of motion , thus resulting in an extended period of inflation .",
    "the rapid decay of the anisotropy results in the class of initial conditions allowed by observations to be greatly increased . under the same assumptions ,",
    "bianchi i and bianchi v brane - world cosmological models containing standard cosmological fluids with linear equation of state ( eos ) ( @xmath7 ) also behave in a similar manner  @xcite . the same is also true for more general homogeneous models @xcite and even some inhomogeneous exact solutions @xcite .",
    "finally , within the limitations of a perturbative treatment , the quadratic - term - dominated isotropic brane - world models have been shown to be local past attractors in the larger state space of inhomogeneous and anisotropic models  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , again assuming that the 5-d weyl tensor contribution to the brane can be neglected , large - scale perturbations of the isotropic models vanish in the past , approaching the singularity .",
    "large scale perturbations @xmath8 are the only type relevant to this kind of analysis for non - inflationary matter , because for any given @xmath9 there is always an early enough time such that @xmath8 is satisfied a given scale much larger than the hubble horizon @xmath10 at a given time will  enter the horizon \" ( @xmath11 ) at a later time . in practice , neglecting small scales perturbations is equivalent to neglect gradients and thus the laplace operator term in the evolution equations , which then become ordinary differential equations . in the perturbative context , this is analogous to the bkl approximation @xcite . ] .",
    "thus in the brane scenario the observed high isotropy of the universe is built in , i.e.  the natural outcome of _ generic initial conditions _",
    ", unlike in general relativity where general cosmological models with a linear eos are highly anisotropic in the past , approaching the singularity _ a - la _ bkl , i.e. with mixmaster dynamics @xcite .    it would therefore be interesting to see if the behavior of the anisotropy at the singularity found in the brane scenario is recreated in the general relativistic context if we consider a quadratic term in the eos .",
    "that is , do we have a scenario where , in general relativity , the generic asymptotic attractor in the past is an isotropic model , thanks to a non - linear eos .",
    "this is the question we aim to investigate , for the specific case of the eos @xmath12 .",
    "this is a simplified version of that used in paper i@xcite , where the focus was on using a quadratic eos to represent a dark energy component or unified dark matter .",
    "it is general enough to analyze the high energy dynamics we are interested here , while still allowing for an effective cosmological constant and phantom behavior .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we outline the setup of the models under investigation , defining three classes , one of which represents a fluid with phantom behavior . using dynamical system methods @xcite , in section iii we consider the anisotropic bianchi i and v class of homogenous models containing a perfect fluid with quadratic eos , showing how models with standard non - phantom matter are asymptotic in the past to an isotropic fixed point is . using covariant and gauge invariant variables @xcite , in section iv",
    "we give the linearized evolution and constraint equations for generic inhomogeneous and anisotropic perturbations about a flat friedmann model with a quadratic eos .",
    "we solve the equations in the large scale limit @xmath8 and show that the perturbations vanish as the singularity is approached , indicating that the isotropic model is is the generic past attractor .",
    "we then finish with some concluding remarks and discussion in section v.",
    "we begin with a summary of the most relevant points that can be derived mostly from an analysis of energy conservation alone . more details can be found in section ii in paper i@xcite .",
    "the energy conservation equation for a cosmological model containing a perfect fluid is : @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the energy density ,",

    "( [ conserv ] ) gives : @xmath20    in the case of the homogenous and anisotropic bianchi i cosmological models , the amplitude of the shear scales as : @xmath21    this example shows how the shear can decay rapidly in an expanding model , growing larger for smaller @xmath17 . if the dynamics of the model is such that @xmath22 , both @xmath14 and @xmath23 blow up , and the model has a physical singularity . in the case",
    "@xmath24 , the so called  phantom \" fluid @xcite , the energy density counter intuitively decays ( grows ) in the past ( future ) and therefore any shear component always comes to dominate at the initial  big bang \" singularity . in the case when @xmath25 the energy density decays during expansion , but at a slower rate than the shear , so that once again the shear component dominates at the singularity . in approaching these singularities matter with linear eos @xmath5",
    "is un - influential , therefore these singularities may be termed velocity dominated @xcite .",
    "it is only in the case when @xmath26 (  super - stiff \" fluid ) that the energy density is dominant in the past and therefore the initial singularity is isotropic .",
    "this indicates that as the initial singularity is approached in the standard homogenous model with @xmath5 , any residual anisotropy will generally come to dominate near the singularity .",
    "the anisotropy is a generic feature of these models and the initial singularity is in general anisotropic and velocity dominated .",
    "as discussed earlier , motivated by the results in the brane - world models , we aim to investigate the effects of introducing a non - linear eos on the behavior of anisotropic models .",
    "the eos we propose is quadratic in the energy density ( we neglect the constant pressure term introduced in paper i@xcite as in general this only modifies late time behavior ) : @xmath27    the discrete parameter @xmath28 denotes the sign of the quadratic term , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 sets the energy scale above which this term becomes relevant . the energy conservation equation ( [ conserv ] ) can now be integrated to give the scaling of the energy density as a function of the scale factor ( except for @xmath31 ) .",

    "the first motivation for this work is that in the context of brane world cosmological models the term quadratic in the energy density that appears in the effective 4-dimensional equations of motion on the brane dominates at early times , driving the evolution to an initial isotropic singularity under reasonable assumptions .",
    "therefore , under these assumptions , in the brane world scenario we do not have the classical isotropy problem : the isotropy we observe today is built in , that is it follows from _ generic initial conditions_. this is at odds with the classical and now widely accepted results in general relativity @xcite , where general cosmological models with a linear eos are highly anisotropic in the past , approaching the singularity _ a - la _ bkl , i.e. with mixmaster dynamics , so that in general one needs _ special initial conditions _ to have isotropy at late times , even to initiate an inflationary phase @xcite .",
    "secondly , we also wanted to study the effects at early times and at high energies of the same type of eos used in paper i@xcite , relaxing the symmetries assumed there .",
    "the focus in paper i@xcite was on the possible use of a quadratic eos as an effective way of representing a dark energy component or unified dark matter in the context of homogeneous isotropic models of relevance for the universe at late times .",
    "here we have used the simplified eos @xmath251 , which still allows for an effective cosmological constant and phantom behavior , and is general enough to analyze the dynamics at high energies .    in summary ,",
    "our aim here was to investigate if the behavior of the anisotropy at the singularity found in the brane scenario is recreated in the general relativistic context if we consider a quadratic term in the eos .",
    "that is to say , in the language of dynamical system theory , do we have a scenario where the generic asymptotic past attractor in general relativity is an isotropic model , thanks to a non - linear ( specifically , quadratic ) eos .    to this end",
    ", we have first summarized in section [ section2 ] the classification of the energy density evolution in three classes , * a * , * b * and * c * , following from the energy conservation for the eos @xmath12 ( a broader classification can be found in section ii of paper i@xcite ) . in section [ section3 ] , using dynamical system methods @xcite , we have studied the bianchi i and v cosmological models with a fluid with this eos .",
    "we first considered the case when @xmath146 ( case * a * ) .",
    "the physically interesting quantity @xmath252 , the hubble normalized dimensionless measure of shear , describes the anisotropy . in the expanding bianchi i and v models this quantity always decreases at late times , as in the case with a _ linear _ eos , approaching a minkowski model .",
    "however , we can now have stages at early times in which @xmath252 grows , vanishing at the initial singularity , and generic trajectories in the compactified state space asymptotically approach in the past the isotropic fixed point is , as depicted in figs . [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "this behavior is similar to the quasi - isotropic expansion seen in the anisotropic brane - world models , but occurs for different reasons .",
    "the quasi - isotropic expansion is caused by the fact that the eos becomes  super - stiff \" at early times but decreases to finite values at late times . at the initial singularity ( which is of type iii ,",
    "see @xcite ) the anisotropy is always sub - dominant and we recover the standard _ linear _ eos behavior at late times . in the case",
    "@xmath145 , the state space can be divided in two regions . in the standard fluid region ( @xmath182 ,",
    "case * b * ) the behavior at early times is similar to the @xmath146 case , with generic trajectories in the compactified state space approaching the isotropic fixed point is of figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] . at late times",
    "instead trajectories asymptotically approach generalized expanding de sitter models . finally , in the phantom fluid region ( @xmath183 , case * c * ) the anisotropy dominates at early times and the past singularity is anisotropic .",
    "trajectories are asymptotic to the expanding de sitter model at late times .",
    "the submanifold @xmath253 in the state space for the bianchi models represents homogeneous isotropic spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker models , with is as past attractor . in order to see",
    "if is can be regarded as the past attractor of a larger class of general models with no symmetries , we have studied in section [ section4 ] , using covariant and gauge invariant variables @xcite , the first order inhomogeneous anisotropic perturbations of these flat isotropic models , focusing on those of class * a*. the linearized equations have been solved in the large scale limit @xmath254 , neglecting the laplacian operators terms . as explained in section [ intro ] , only perturbations larger then the hubble horizon @xmath213 are relevant in our analysis .",
    "the main results of this section are given in table s  [ table1 ] ,  [ table2 ] and  [ table3 ] .",
    "the tables contain the form of the solutions and asymptotic behavior of the physically relevant quantities for both early ( @xmath255 ) and late times ( @xmath256 ) .",
    "the quantities have been harmonically decomposed into the standard scalar , vector and tensor components .",
    "these include the expansion normalized vorticity , shear , and electric and magnetic contributions of the weyl tensor .",
    "in addition , we consider the gradients of the energy density , expansion and three - curvature . as expected , at late times the perturbations evolve as if the fluid obeyed a _ linear _ eos , i.e. the standard behavior is recovered in this limit .",
    "the evolution of the perturbations at early times is our main result .",
    "indeed , we find that all perturbations tend to zero near the singularity .",
    "thus a perturbed quasi - isotropic model with generic initial condition evolves from the isotropic past attractor is .",
    "this indicates that in general relativity with matter described by a non - linear eos there are general cosmological models , corresponding to a non zero measure subset of all possible generic initial conditions @xcite , that isotropize as the initial singularity is approached , with is as the past attractor . as for the brane models",
    ", this would be at odds with the standard bkl results @xcite .",
    "singularities are commonly regarded as signaling the failure of classical gravitational theories , requiring a quantum theory of gravity to deal with trans - plankian energies .",
    "even in effective theories , perhaps cosmology does nt require them , as in the pre - big - bang scenario @xcite . in any case , it is important to understand which is the typical classical dynamical behavior in the neighborhood of singularities , as this possibly signals what the generic outcome of a quantum theory should be at low ( sub - plankian ) energies . in the bkl picture for fluids with linear eos and other simple type of matter @xcite",
    "this behavior is mixmaster and the effects of matter become negligible close to the singularity : we may say that effectively in this limit the space - time still tells matter how to move , but matter is no longer able to tell the space - time how to curve .",
    "perhaps this behavior should be regarded as pathological , and peculiar of the energy - momentum tensor of linear eos matter ( or other simple energy - momentum tensor ) in general relativity . in practice we know close to nothing about matter fields at the highest ( close to plankian ) cosmological energies , and these may require a non - linear effective eos description in general , or maybe einstein equations with an effective non - linear eos are the einstein frame version of some effective low energy ( sub - plankian ) theory . in both cases , our analysis of einstein equations with a fluid with a quadratic eos indicates that the typical initial state is isotropic .",
    "the singularity is matter dominated , and of a type that could admit an extension .",
    "interestingly , the eos considered here are a subclass of those used in paper i@xcite to model a dark energy component or unified dark matter , allowing for effective cosmological constants .",
