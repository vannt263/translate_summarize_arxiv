    "the observation of a ferromagnetic insulating phase in the low - doped manganites @xmath0  with @xmath10 raised a large number of studies aimed to explain the properties of this phase ( e.g. ) .",
    "several studies have shown that charge and orbital ordering phenomena are crucial to understand the obvious contradiction to the bare double exchange ( de ) model , which predicts metallic behavior in case of ferromagnetic spin order .",
    "recently , resonant x - ray diffraction succeeded to detect the formation of an orbital polaron lattice ( opl ) at low temperatures , which unifies ferromagnetic and insulating properties in a natural way .",
    "it was suggested that local charge hopping processes contribute significantly to the stabilization of the orbital polarons .",
    "further support for this conclusion was found in a recent thermodynamic study which proved the magnetic de energy to be crucial for the stabilization of the opl.@xcite    the substitution of la by smaller pr , i.e. the application of chemical pressure , provides a direct route to influence the balance between the various couplings that stabilize the opl in the fmi phase .",
    "more specifically , pr doping causes an increase of the octahedral tilt angles , thereby reducing the mn - o - mn bond angles and the hopping term @xmath9 .",
    "it is well known that this structural change dramatically alters the relative stability of different possible phases .",
    "@xcite in particular , metallic phases with delocalized charges are suppressed upon decreasing @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to the application of negative chemical pressure , where different samples with different amounts of pr are studied , hydrostatic positive pressure effects can be studied on a single particular compound . here , we present data on the doping dependence of the ordering phenomena in ( la@xmath3pr@xmath4)@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath7 , with @xmath11=0 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , and on their hydrostatic pressure dependence in @xmath8 .",
    "our data imply that the opl phase is stabilized by hydrostatic pressure , i.e. upon increasing the charge mobility @xmath9 . whereas , application of negative chemical pressure yields the opposite results .",
    "the verification of the grneisen scaling and the analysis of short range orbital correlations reinforces our conclusions .",
    "our study hence clearly confirms the microscopic opl model .",
    "we mention that recently ferromagnetic correlations have been found in the charge stripe ordered phase of @xmath12 , which might be due to local de , too.@xcite the application of chemical or external pressure might hence also affect the ferromagnetism in the doped nickelates as it is well known in the low - doped manganites .",
    "we report on measurements of the magnetisation , the specific heat , the thermal expansion , and on high energy x - ray diffraction data of @xmath13  single crystals in external magnetic fields up to 16 t .",
    "the experiments were carried out on single crystals , with @xmath11=0 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , grown by the floating zone method.@xcite the magnetisation @xmath14 was measured with a squid and a vibrating sample magnetometer .",
    "magnetization measurements under hydrostatic pressure were performed in the temperature range 4.2 - 350k using an mpms squid magnetometer ( quantum design ) and a miniature piston - cylinder pressure cell made of cu - be alloy ( psm 100 , tetcon international ) .",
    "silicon oil was used as the pressure transmitting medium .",
    "constant magnetic fields of 0.05 t in the temperature region 50 - 250k and of 0.5 t were used in the temperature range 250 - 350k for all measurements under pressure .",
    "the pressure at low temperature was determined by the pressure dependence of superconducting transition temperature of high purity pb placed with the sample .",
    "the specific heat @xmath15 was measured using a high resolution calorimeter . here ,",
    "we have applied two different quasi - adiabatic methods , continuous heating and heating pulses .",
    "@xcite for the thermal expansion studies we applied a high resolution capacitive dilatometer.@xcite hard x - ray data have been measured at the beamline bw5 at the hasylab , hamburg . for experimental details",
    "see ref .  .",
    "the phase diagram of ( la@xmath3pr@xmath4)@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath7  as it is presented in fig .  [ pd ] was established by measurements of the magnetization , the specific heat , the electrical resistivity , and by x - ray diffraction data . for @xmath16 ,",
    "several ordering phenomena are observed upon cooling . at",
    "= 270k , a cooperative jahn - teller effect evolves , and ferromagnetic spin occurs at  = 183k .",
    "eventually , the ferromagnetic insulating phase exhibiting the orbital polaron lattice is realized below  = 150k . upon pr doping , i.e. by applying chemical pressure , all ordering temperatures significantly change .",
    "( 1 ) the orbital polaron lattice is rapidly suppressed upon pr doping . already for @xmath17 the orbital polaron lattice is considerably destabilized , while it is completely suppressed for @xmath18 .",
    "( 2 )  is suppressed , too , but the effect on the ferromagnetic spin ordering is less than on .",
    "( 3 )  increases upon pr doping , i.e. the cooperative jahn - teller distortions are stabilized .    in fig .",
    "[ mag](a ) we show the effect of the spin and the orbital ordering on the magnetization of @xmath8 , under various applied magnetic fields up to 14 t .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field on the opl phase is also illustrated by fig .",
    "[ mag](b ) which displays the field dependence of . at low temperatures",
    "the ferromagnetic opl phase is realized . upon heating",
    ", the orbital polaron lattice melts at  @xmath19 110k , at which the transition is associated with a kink in the magnetization @xmath20 .",
    "this kink is visible in fig .",
    "[ mag](a ) e.g. at @xmath21 t .",
    "the measurements in different magnetic fields imply that  increases by 22k upon application of @xmath22 t [ see fig .",
    "[ mag](b ) ] .",
    "a similar behavior was observed for @xmath23  ( see fig.6 of ref .  ) .",
    "when the temperature is further increased , the ferromagnetic spin order vanishes at  @xmath19 168k , and the structural jahn - teller phase transition is observed at  @xmath19 296k.@xcite    in order to study the effect of ( _ positive _ ) hydrostatic pressure on the orbital and spin ordering phenomena , we studied the temperature dependence of the magnetization of ( la@xmath24pr@xmath25)@xmath26sr@xmath27mno@xmath28  single crystals at various hydrostatic pressures up to 0.82gpa [ see fig .",
    "[ pressure1](a ) ] .",
    "the data show the increase of the magnetization in the ferromagnetic metallic ( fmm ) and in the ferromagnetic opl phase upon application of external hydrostatic pressure , whereas there are only minor pressure effects on the paramagnetic phase at @xmath29 . from the data in fig .",
    "[ pressure1](a ) , we have derived the pressure dependencies of the ordering temperatures ,  and , respectively , which are displayed in fig .",
    "[ pressure2 ] .",
    "the data show that  and  increase upon applying hydrostatic pressure , whereas  becomes smaller .",
    "thermodynamically , this behavior is in accordance with the fact that the volume of the unit cell shrinks at the jahn - teller transition and increases at  and .@xcite    the fact that both the magnetization below  down to 50k and  itself increase as a function of pressure is well understood in the framework of the de model .",
    "enhancement of under hydrostatic pressure is a common trend of perovskite manganites , whereas in the single layered manganites uniaxial pressure is necessary to affect the spin ordering phenomena significantly.@xcite in the case of ( la@xmath24pr@xmath25)@xmath26sr@xmath27mno@xmath28 , the hydrostatic pressure yields an increase of @xmath9 , thereby stabilizing the fmm ordered phase by enhancing the mobility of the charge carriers via the de .",
    "remarkably , the hydrostatic pressure dependence not only of  but also of  is positive .",
    "this observation proves the important role of the charge hopping @xmath9 and the de for the stabilization of the opl .",
    "the comparison of the magnetic field and the hydrostatic pressure effect on  suggests that the application of @xmath30 t is approximately equivalent to the application of 1gpa pressure .    at ambient pressure ,",
    "the structural phase transition to the co - operative jahn - teller - distorted phase occurs close to room temperature , i.e.  @xmath19 296k , for @xmath17 . under applied hydrostatic pressure , i.e. if the hopping parameter @xmath9 and hence the charge mobility is increased , the cooperative jt distorted phase becomes suppressed and the dynamic jt phase is stabilized .",
    "these effects are just opposite to the chemical pressure effect upon pr doping ( @xmath11=0.1 ) at the la site .",
    "note , that the effect of destabilization of the cooperative jt phase and stabilization of dynamic jt phase is observed in @xmath0  under applied magnetic field , too.@xcite    a striking feature of our data is that , at high pressure ,  increases faster than  under pressure .",
    "this means that changes of @xmath9 influence the opl phase more effectively than the fmm phase , i.e. the de promotes the opl even more efficiently than the fmm phase .",
    "faster increase of  than  was reported under pressure in the low - doped regime around @xmath31.@xcite for small external pressure , however , the effect on  is similar to that on , which agrees with the grneisen scaling presented in sec.[secgruen ] .",
    "the experimental data presented in the previous sections show that chemical ( i.e. _ negative _ hydrostatic ) pressure due to the substitution of pr causes the destabilization of the opl phase in @xmath23 , whereas _ positive _ hydrostatic pressure yields the opposite effect .",
    "we have shown experimentally that the hopping @xmath9 significantly contributes to the stabilization of the opl .",
    "this fact provides a natural explanation for the absence of the opl in the fmi - phase of lightly doped la@xmath32ca@xmath33mno@xmath28  and pr@xmath32ca@xmath33mno@xmath28 , where @xmath9 is reduced due to the smaller pr and ca sites . for these systems",
    "there is evidence that a fmi and cooperative jahn - teller distorted phase exists , which corresponds to the low temperature phase of ( la@xmath3pr@xmath4)@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath7  with @xmath34 .",
    "the relevance of the charge hopping @xmath9 for the stabilization of the opl in la@xmath35sr@xmath36mno@xmath7  is further supported by the measurements shown in fig.[fig : dot_vgl_hxs_m ] . in this figure ,",
    "the temperature dependencies of the magnetization measured in an external field of 0.5tesla and the intensities of the superlattice reflections measured by high - energy x - ray diffraction are compared for @xmath37 , 1/8 and 0.14 .",
    "the magnetic entropy in the fmm - phase between  and  decreases with increasing doping level ; i.e. the magnetic disorder in this phase is largest for @xmath37 and decreases towards @xmath38 .",
    "according to the double exchange ( de ) , the charge hopping in the fmm - phase of la@xmath39sr@xmath40mno@xmath28 is considerably suppressed , as the magnetic disorder is large . at the same time",
    ", the intensity of the superstructure reflection corresponding to the opl vanishes completely in the fmm - phase [ fig.[fig : dot_vgl_hxs_m](a ) ] of this compound .",
    "the increase of the strontium doping to @xmath31 leads to a reduction of the magnetic disorder in the fmm - phase as compared to the @xmath37 sample . in this case",
    ", the superstructure reflection corresponding to the opl is already observed in the fmm - phase [ fig.[fig : dot_vgl_hxs_m](b ) ] , revealing the presence of short range opl order in the fmm - phase of la@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath7 .",
    "similarly , the hxs - measurements on la@xmath41sr@xmath42mno@xmath28 indicate the presence of short range opl correlations above , too [ cf . fig.[fig : dot_vgl_hxs_m](c ) ] .    a remarkable observation concerns the temperatures which mark the onset of the short range correlations .",
    "as indicated in fig.[fig : dot_vgl_hxs_m ] , the onset of the short range correlations in the samples with @xmath31 and @xmath38 corresponds in both cases to the temperature where the magnetization reaches about 75% of its saturation value . for @xmath37 ,",
    "the magnetization never reaches the 75% value ( gray horizontal line in fig.[fig : dot_vgl_hxs_m ] ) in the fmm phase of @xmath37 ; i.e. the magnetic disorder is too large to allow for the short range opl order .",
    "the results presented above clearly show that the formation of the opl phase and of the fmm phase is based on a common energy scale which is given by the hopping parameter @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the pressure dependencies of the relevant energy scale for the ordering phenomena must agree , since it is the same energy scale . this can be checked experimentally by the verification of the grneisen scaling , i.e by measuring the anomalous contributions to the specific heat @xmath15 and to the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath43 .",
    "if the grneisen scaling is fulfilled , both quantities are proportional .",
    "quantitatively , the grneisen relation reads    @xmath44    with @xmath45 being the relevant energy scale of the respective ordering phenomenon , i.e. in the case at hand @xmath46 .",
    "we hence studied the specific heat and the thermal expansion coefficient of @xmath23 . from both data we subtracted the phonic contribution , which was estimated from the specific heat data as is explained e.g. in ref . .",
    "the resulting anomalous contributions to the specific heat and to the thermal expansion are shown in fig .",
    "[ gruen ] .",
    "as has been shown earlier@xcite , the formation of the fmm phase causes a jump of the specific heat at  and a large peak is associated with the onset of the opl phase at .",
    "in addition , there is a regime of anomalous entropy changes at  @xmath47 .",
    "all these features are visible in the thermal expansion data in fig .",
    "[ gruen](a ) , too .",
    "there is a peak at , a jump at  and a regime of anomalous length changes in the whole fmm phase .",
    "the data hence clearly prove very similar temperature dependencies of @xmath15 and @xmath43 .",
    "this observation implies that both ordering phenomena at  and at  have the same pressure dependence , which reinforces our conclusions drawn above .",
    "in addition , this is also true for the entropy changes in the whole temperature regime  @xmath48 .",
    "this conclusion does not only hold for @xmath23  but also for @xmath37 and 0.14 .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ gruen2 ] , which shows that the grneisen scaling is valid in its integral form for these compositions .",
    "the figure presents the temperature dependencies of the orthorhombicity @xmath49 and of the anomalous entropy changes @xmath50 .",
    "our results show that charge hopping processes are essential to stabilize the opl in la@xmath35sr@xmath36mno@xmath7 .",
    "however , since the opl leads to macroscopically insulating behavior , these hopping processes take place on a local scale , i.e. within the orbital polarons . to be more specific ,",
    "the orbital polarons are ferromagnetic objects which get stabilized by local de processes.@xcite the pressure effects enhance the local de processes by increasing @xmath9 and hence lead to the stabilization of opl at low temperature . the magnetic disorder and the suppression of the orbital polaron lattice created by the pr ( @xmath11=0.1 ) doping is counterbalanced by the external pressure for stabilizing the orbital polaron lattice at low temperatures .",
    "our analysis of the short range orbital correlations and the verification of the grneisen scaling reinforces our conclusions regarding the relevance of @xmath9 and de for the formation of the opl .",
