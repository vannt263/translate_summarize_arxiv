    "this allows quarks and leptons to be embedded into unique multiplets associated with extended gauge symmetries  @xcite . in spite of lack of further experimental confirmations ,",
    "the quark - lepton symmetry and unification  @xcite   are still the most appealing concepts in physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "tiny neutrino masses emerge naturally from the seesaw mechanism  @xcite , which implies the existence of right handed neutrino fields @xmath7 and new high energy scale .",
    "the seesaw scale turns out to be numerically rather close to the scale of grand unification ( gu ) , which emerges from the unification of gauge couplings .",
    "it seems as if both gauge and fermion unification point in the same direction of certain grand unified theory , like so(10 ) guts  @xcite .    on the basis of quark - lepton unification ( symmetry )",
    "one would expect similarities between the mass and mixing patterns of quarks and leptons .",
    "however , observations  @xcite do not support this expectation .",
    "indeed ,    * neutrino masses and mixings differ strongly from those in the quark sector .",
    "the hierarchy of neutrino masses , if exists , is weaker than the quark mass hierarchy . the 2 - 3 leptonic mixing is maximal or close to maximal , whereas the corresponding quark mixing is very small .",
    "the 1 - 2 leptonic mixing is large but not maximal and it seems smaller than the 2 - 3 leptonic mixing . in contrast , the 1 - 2 quark mixing - the largest quark mixing - is small .",
    "the only common feature is that the 1 - 3 mixings are small in both sectors .",
    "* data seem to indicate a particular `` neutrino symmetry ''  @xcite  which does not show up in other sectors of the theory .",
    "this includes maximal or nearly maximal 2 - 3 mixing and relatively small 1 - 3 mixing .",
    "if the neutrino mass spectrum would turn out to be quasi - degenerate , this could imply certain symmetry too .",
    "however , it is very difficult to extend the suggested symmetries not only onto the quarks but also to charged leptons and models ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ) which realize such neutrino symmetries are quite involved . * in the context of the seesaw mechanism , the observed values of neutrino masses require the masses of the right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos to be @xmath8  gev , _",
    "i.e. _ two orders of magnitude below the grand unification scale , @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , the data implies a certain flavor structure and a hierarchy of the rh neutrino mass matrix which may indicate that the scale of rh neutrino masses emerges as a combination of the gu - scale and some other scale close to the planck mass @xmath10 : @xmath11 * the experimental values of the quark and lepton mixing angles between the first and second generations appear to sum up to the maximal mixing angle : @xmath12 with the leptonic mixing angle @xmath13 and the cabibbo angle @xmath14 .",
    "the interpretation of such a quark - lepton complementarity relation  @xcite   is rather controversial .",
    "if it is not a numerical accident , relation  ( [ eq : qlc ] ) implies some quark - lepton connection which is not present in ordinary guts .",
    "it may require some additional structure in the leptonic sector which produces maximal mixing and therefore has certain symmetry .",
    "all these observations can be considered as hints against a simple unification of quarks and leptons .",
    "there exist various attempts to reconcile the possible quark - lepton symmetry ( unification ) and the strong difference of patterns of masses and mixing in two sectors .",
    "the main problem is that the strong hierarchy of eigenvalues and small mixings of the quark mass matrices imply a certain hierarchy in the dirac type yukawa couplings which propagates due to the symmetry / unification to the lepton sector ( see , however  @xcite ) .",
    "one possible solution is that dominant contribution to the neutrino masses , _",
    "e.g. _ , from the yukawa coupling with a higgs triplet , has no analogy in the quark sector .",
    "however , even in this case , it seems rather unnatural that some yukawa interactions have a particular symmetry which is not realized for other yukawa interactions . in the context of seesaw mechanism",
    "the observed features of neutrino masses and mixing can be related to a particular structure of the majorana mass matrix of the rh neutrinos  @xcite .    in this paper in order to reconcile the observed pattern of the neutrino masses and mixings and quark - lepton symmetry , we elaborate on the double seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we will discuss a version where the flavor structures of the dirac type yukawa couplings cancel completely  @xcite , in the light neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the properties of the neutrino mass matrix are entirely determined by physics ( in particular , symmetries ) at energies above the grand unification scale .",
