    "with conjecture [ co : tl - fpl ] in mind , conjecture [ co : asm2hex ] implies that fpl diagrams with matching @xmath251 $ ] are equinumerous with lozenge tilings on @xmath257 .",

    "we first note that every matching fixes the loops of the corresponding fpl diagrams to pass through a particular set of edges .",
    "let us call these edges * fixed edges*. the way these edges are fixed is prescribed in    the implication @xmath260 holds if the top and bottom loop segments do not belong to the same loop and if either of the following holds ,    * the middle loop segment belongs to a third loop .",
    "* if the middle loop segment belongs to the same loop as the top or bottom segment , it is connected to it via one of the leftmost edges .",
    "in case i ) the third loop has to pass between the top and bottom loop segments while the condition in case ii ) excludes possibilities like @xmath261    the fixed edges can be adjacent and therefore do not necessarily form a perfect matching .",
    "furthermore , for a matching @xmath251 $ ] every site of @xmath230 is part of a fixed edge .    none of the fpl diagrams with matching @xmath251 $ ] contains an internal closed loop .    for the matching",
    "@xmath262 the fixed edges resulting from the first @xmath162 parentheses , and the parentheses @xmath263 and @xmath237 are @xmath264 for clarity of the picture , the fixed edges resulting from the last @xmath216 parentheses are not drawn .",
    "that region of fixed edges partly overlaps the region of fixed edges corresponding to the first @xmath162 parentheses .",
    "[ rem : fixed ] more edges may in fact be fixed due to the specific geometry of the grid @xmath230 .",
    "since for matchings @xmath251 $ ] all sites correspond to a fixed edge , the problem of counting all fpl diagrams with this matching reduces to a dimer problem which is equivalent to a lozenge tiling problem on a graph defined by the fixed edges .",
    "this graph is called the * fixed graph*. it forms a folded piece of triangular lattice and is obtained by joining the midpoints of all the fixed edges .",
    "[ ex : fixedg ] for the matching @xmath265 , the set of fixed edges and its corresponding fixed graph is @xmath266 the graph consists of three homogeneous regions arising from the fixed edges of the first 5 parentheses , parentheses 6,7 and 8 and the last 4 parentheses respectively .",
    "the first and last region partially overlap in the top middle of the picture , where the fixed edges are adjacent . to guide the eye , the region between the three homogeneous regions is shaded .",
    "as already hinted at in remark [ rem : fixed ] , the particular geometry of the fixed graph completely determines dimer or tiling configurations on certain regions .",
    "these regions are the overlapping parts of the fixed graph and patches in the lower left and right corners .",
    "they do therefore not contribute to the enumeration and may as well be removed .    by removing the overlapping part of the graph in example [ ex : fixedg ] and deforming it",
    "so that it fits on the triangular lattice , it follows that the fixed graph for the matching @xmath265 is @xmath267 the lightly shaded area corresponds to the shaded area of example [ ex : fixedg ] , and is a guide to the eye only .",
    "the regions on which dimer configurations are enforced by the geometry are shaded darker .    when the regions with fixed dimer configurations are removed , the resulting graph is precisely that of a hexagon with maximal staircases removed from adjacent corners @xcite and whose sides are given by @xmath268 , @xmath269 and @xmath51 .",
    "the number of dimer configurations on such hexagons is given by theorem 1.6 of @xcite .",
    "theorem [ th : ha ] then follows immediately from that result .",
    "there is another model known that displays the appearance of alternating sign matrix numbers in its stationary state .",
    "this is the rotor model @xcite which is based on two temperley - lieb algebras .",
    "it is conjectured that in that model also 3-enumerations of asms @xcite play a role .",
    "many conjectures are stated but remain unproven .",
    "one may hope that again the solvability of the six - vertex model and the xxz spin chain @xcite can be used to find proofs .",
    "in particular the very special properties at @xmath270 , see e.g. @xcite , have already led to several interesting results @xcite .",
