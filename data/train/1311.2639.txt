    "neutrino phenomena are describable by the majorana neutrino mass matrix , @xmath0 where we work in the basis in which the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , the @xmath1 are real and nonnegative , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 here @xmath4 and @xmath5 stand for the sine and cosine of the mixing angles @xmath6 .",
    "we study the consequences of imposing two texture / cofactor zeros in the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "there are three classes of such ansatzes : two texture zeros ( tt )  @xcite , two cofactor zeros ( cc )  @xcite , and one texture zero and one cofactor zero ( tc )  @xcite . of the nine real parameters of @xmath7 ,",
    "five are fixed by measurements of the three mixing angles and two mass - squared differences ; for a recent global three - neutrino fit see ref .",
    "the remaining four parameters , which we take to be the lightest mass , the dirac phase , and the two majorana phases , can then be determined from the four constraints that define the two texture / cofactor zeros .",
    "consequently , the rate for neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath8 ) which is given by the magnitude of the @xmath9 element of the neutrino mass matrix , @xmath10 is also determined .    in sections 2 , 3 and 4 , we use current experimental data to study the allowed parameter space for two texture zeros , two cofactor zeros , and one texture and one cofactor zero , respectively .",
    "we discuss and summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "the condition for a vanishing element @xmath11 is @xmath12 since there are two such constraints that depend linearly on the masses , the masses are related by @xmath13 where @xmath14 are complex numbers that are quartic in the matrix elements of @xmath15 .",
    "then , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we get two equations that relate @xmath18 to the oscillation parameters and the dirac phase @xmath19 , @xmath20 where the plus and minus signs correspond to the normal hierarchy ( nh ) and the inverted hierarchy ( ih ) , respectively . ( for the nh the lightest mass is @xmath18 , and for the ih the lightest mass is @xmath21 . ) for a fixed set of oscillation parameters each of these two equations give @xmath18 as a function of @xmath19 , and the intersections of the curves give the allowed values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we use the data from the latest global fit of ref .",
    "@xcite to find the @xmath22 allowed regions for the lightest mass and @xmath19 that satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : m1texture ] ) .",
    "note that if we replace @xmath19 by @xmath23 , the two constraints from the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : m1texture ] ) will be the same since the magnitude of @xmath24 does not depend on the sign of @xmath19 , but because the latest global fit has a preference for negative values of @xmath19  @xcite , the allowed regions for @xmath25 are a little larger than for @xmath26 .    for two texture zeros in the mass matrix ,",
    "there are @xmath27 different cases to consider .",
    "if two off - diagonal entries vanish , the mass matrices are block diagonal and have one neutrino decoupled from the others , which is inconsistent with the data .",
    "therefore , we only need to consider 12 cases that can be divided into three categories :    .the expressions for @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for class x. the symbol @xmath31 denotes a nonzero matrix element .",
