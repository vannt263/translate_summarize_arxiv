    "in our scheme @xcite for target detection a probe beam of a bipartite correlated state may be partially reflected by an object towards a camera , which also receives a thermal field acting as noisy unknown background ( thermal bath ) . *",
    "our goal is to investigate the performances of the quantum protocol , in a detection framework in which only photon numbers ( i.e. intensities ) are measured , with respect to the best classical counterpart , namely a classically - correlated - light based protocol .",
    "we show as the use of simple second order correlation measurements already suffices in guaranteeing strong advantages to the quantum protocol .",
    "* this is a fundamental progress toward a practical realisation respect to some previous similar theoretical proposals @xcite , stemming from the `` quantum illumination '' scheme of @xcite , where the discrimination strategy , based on quantum chernoff bound @xcite , was very challenging from an experimental point of view .",
    "we realise quantum target detection both by using quantum illumination ( qi ) , specifically twin beams ( twb ) , and by using classical illumination ( ci ) , e.g. correlated thermal beams ( thb ) * , representing the best classical state in the specific detection framework , * pointing out unequivocally the experimental advantage of the quantum protocol in mesoscopic regime , independently on the noise level .",
    "the realisation of qi protocol , beyond paving the way to future practical application , also provides a significant example of ancilla assisted quantum protocol besides the few previous ones , e.g.@xcite . as a first application of quantum illumination to qkd , with a different detection scheme ,",
    "refer to the recent paper @xcite .",
    "in our setup ( figure  [ setup ] ) correlated photon pairs in orthogonal polarisations are generated in parametric down conversion ( pdc ) process by pumping a bbo ( beta - barium - borate ) non - linear crystal with the third harmonic ( 355  nm ) of a q - switched nd - yag laser ( repetition rate of 10  hz , 5  ns pulse width ) after spatial filtering .",
    "the correlated emissions are then addressed to a high quantum efficiency ( about 80  % at 710  nm ) ccd camera ( @xmath0 pixels of size @xmath1 ) .",
    "the exposure time of the camera is set to collect in a single image the emission generated by a single laser shot . for qi protocol ( figure  [ setup]a ) after the bbo crystal , where twb are generated , one of the beam ( the `` ancilla '' ) is reflected towards the detection system . the correlated beam is partially detected , together with the thermal field from the arecchi s disk , when the object ( actually a beam splitter ) is present , otherwise it is lost ( not showed ) . low - pass filter ( 95  % of transmission at 710 nm ) and uv - reflecting mirror are used to minimize the background noise while maintaining low losses .",
    "a lens , placed at the focal length from the crystal and the ccd camera , realizes the fourier transform of the field at the output face of the crystal .",
    "the pdc light is then combined at the ccd with a thermal background produced by scattering a laser beam on an arecchi s rotating ground glass .",
    "when the object is removed , only the thermal bath reaches the detector . in order to implement ci protocol ( figure  [ setup]b ) ,",
    "the twb are substituted with classical correlated beams .",
    "these are obtained by splitting a multi - thermal beam ( single arm of pdc ) and by setting the pump intensity to ensure equivalent intensity , time and spatial coherence properties for the quantum and the classical sources .",
    "we note that traveling wave pdc generates a spatially multimode emission in the far field , where each mode corresponds to the transverse component of a specific wavevector .",
    "each pair of correlated modes , corresponding to opposite transverse component of the wavevector with respect to the pump direction , are found in symmetric positions @xcite .",
    "thus , we choose two correlated regions of interests ( rois ) on the ccd array ( showed in figure  [ setup ] c - d - e ) .",
    "the proper sizing of the pixels and the centering of the 2-dimensional array with sub - mode precision , allows to maximize the collection of the correlated photons for each pair of pixels and at the same time to minimize the possible presence of uncorrelated ones @xcite . in our experiment , the correlation in the photon number , even at the quantum level for qi , is realized independently for each pair of symmetrical ( translated ) pixels that belong to the rois of the twb ( thb ) .",
    "therefore , a single image is enough to evaluate correlation parameters , like covariance , averaging over the @xmath2 pairs .",
    "albeit not strictly necessary , this is practically effective because reduces the measurement time ( less images are needed ) and avoids to deal with the power instability of the pump laser from pulse to pulse , which is very destructive in this kind of application @xcite .",
    "the number of spatio - temporal modes collected is estimated to be @xmath3 by fitting a multithermal statistics .",
    "the average number of pdc photon per mode is @xmath4 .",
    "we measured separately the size of the spatial mode , as the fwhm of the correlation function between the two beams , @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the number of spatial modes is about @xmath6 and the number of temporal modes @xmath7 , the last one being consistent with the ratio between the pump pulse duration and the expected pdc coherence time , i.e. 1  ps .",
    "in our approach , the ability to distinguish the presence / absence of the object depends on the possibility of distinguishing between the two corresponding values of covariance @xmath8 , evaluated experimentally as @xmath9-e[n_{1}]e[n_{2}],\\ ] ] where the quantity @xmath10= \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{k}}\\sum^{\\mathcal{k}}_{k=1 } x^{(k)}$ ] represents the average over the set of @xmath11 realizations corresponding in our experiment to the pixels of the roi , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , each image provides a determination of the covariance .",
    "then we define the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of counting base qi protocol as the ratio of the mean `` contrast '' to its standard deviation ( mean fluctuation ) : @xmath13 where `` in '' and `` out '' refer to the presence and absence of the object , respectively and @xmath14 is the quantum expectation value . from eq .",
    "( [ cov ] ) follows that @xmath15 and , for @xmath16 , @xmath17\\rangle/\\mathcal{k}$ ] .",
    "these expressions allow calculating @xmath18 theoretically .",
    "in particular the denominator can be calculated as    @xmath19    by replacing @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of detected photons that has been reflected by the target , and @xmath22 is the uncorrelated background , the right hand side of ( [ noise ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath23    where we used the statistical independence of @xmath22 and the fact that @xmath24 .",
    "it is clear that in the absence of the target ( situation labeled with the superscript `` out '' ) , @xmath25 , thus @xmath26 , since nothing is reflected to the detector . however , if the the background fluctuations @xmath27 is the largest contribution to the noise , also when the target is present ( indicated with superscript `` in '' ) we can write @xmath28 . under this assumption representing a realistic situation of a very noisy environment ,",
    "the snr becomes @xmath29 we underline that ( [ snr2 ] ) holds for a dominant background , irrespective of its statistics ( e.g. multi - thermal or poissonian ) .    in our experiment",
    "we consider background with multi - thermal statistics . for",
    "a generic multi - thermal statistics with number of spatiotemporal modes @xmath30 , mean photon number number per mode @xmath31 , the total number of detected photons is @xmath32 and the mean squared fluctuation is @xmath33 [ see for example @xcite , where @xmath34 is the detection efficiency .",
    "thus , the amount of noise introduced by the background can be increased by boosting its total number of photons @xmath35 or by varying the number of modes @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , both twb and correlated thb present locally the same multi - thermal statistics , but with a number of spatiotemporal modes @xmath3 much larger than the one used for the background beam ( @xmath37 in one case and , @xmath38 in the other ) .",
    "this contributes to make the condition of preponderant background effective in our realization , even for a relatively small value of @xmath39 .",
    "however , we point out that all the theoretical curves reported in all the figures are evaluated by the exact analytical calculation of the four order ( in the number of photons ) quantum expectation values appearing on the right hand side of ( [ noise ] ) , even if the whole expressions are far more complex than the ones obtained with the assumption of preponderant background .    starting from ( [ snr2 ] ) and considering the same local resources for classical and quantum illumination beams ( in particular the same local variance @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) ) the enhancement of the quantum protocol",
    "can be easily obtained as    @xmath42    with @xmath43 being the generalized cauchy - schwarz parameter , where @xmath44 is the normally ordered quantum expectation value .",
    "this parameter is interesting since it does not depends on the losses and it quantifies non - classicality being @xmath45 for classical state of light ( with positive @xmath46-function ) .",
    "the covariance of two correlated beams obtained by splitting a single thermal beam is @xmath47 , while the one of twb is @xmath48 ( see for example @xcite ) . by using this relation with the assumption of the same local resources ,",
    "@xmath49 we can derive explicitly @xmath50 , which is insensitive to the amount of noise and loss . on the other side",
    "the generalized cauchy - schwarz parameter for a split thermal beam is @xmath51 , where the subscript `` @xmath52 '' stands for `` in absence of background '' , as it can be easily derived from the equations of covariance and single beam fluctuations used previously .",
    "therefore the comparison with split thermal beams represents the comparison with the `` best '' classical case .",
    "first of all we evaluate the noise reduction factor ( nrf ) defined as @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mean value , and @xmath55 is the fluctuation of the photon number @xmath56 , @xmath41 , detected by correlated pixels .",
    "it represents the noise of the photon number difference normalized to the shot noise level ( snl ) or standard quantum limit ( sql ) @xcite . for classical states @xmath57 , while it is always smaller than 1 for twb . in particular , when the thermal bath is off , we have @xmath58 , with @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the overall detection efficiency of beam @xmath41@xcite .",
    "it includes all the transmission - detection losses , thus @xmath61 due to the presence of the half reflecting object in the path of the second beam . in figure  [ nrf ]",
    "we report the measured nrf and the theoretical prediction . from the inset one can observe that the nrf is actually in the quantum regime ( @xmath62 ) for small values of the thermal bath , and in absence of it we obtain @xmath63 corresponding to @xmath64 .",
    "while , as soon as the contribution of the bath to the fluctuation of @xmath65 becomes dominant , nrf increases quite fast well above the classical threshold . as expected from the multi - thermal character of the bath , the number of modes @xmath36 determines the noise level introduced , and it can be tuned easily according to the spin velocity of the ground - glass disk and/or the acquisition time .",
    "we also note that , for thb , the nrf is always in the classical regime .    as a second figure of merit , more appropriate for quantifying the quantum resources exploited by our qi strategy we consider the generalized cauchy - schwarz parameter",
    "@xmath66 introduced in sec .",
    "[ the model of the measurement ] . in figure  [ nrf ]",
    "we report the measured @xmath66 and the theoretical prediction .",
    "one observes that for twb @xmath67 is actually in the quantum regime ( @xmath68 ) for small values of the thermal background @xmath69 ( @xmath70 when @xmath71 ) . also here",
    ", @xmath67 decreases quite fast , well below the classical threshold with the intensity of the background .",
    "as expected , for thb @xmath72 is always in the classical regime(being one for @xmath71 ) .    in figure",
    "[ snr ] , the @xmath73 is compared with the experimental data , where the estimation of quantum mean values of ( [ snrdef ] ) are obtained by performing averages of @xmath74 over a set of @xmath75 acquired images .",
    "while the snr unavoidably decreases with the added noise for both qi and ci , the ratio between them is almost constant ( @xmath76 ) regardless the value of @xmath22 , in agreement with the results of sec .",
    "[ the model of the measurement ] . in turn , the measurement time , i.e. , the number of repetitions @xmath77 needed for discriminating the presence / absence of the target , is dramatically reduced ( for instance , to achieve @xmath78 , @xmath75 is 100 times smaller when quantum correlations are exploited ) .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ snr ] shows that the mean value of the covariance does not depend on the quantity of environmental noise , because , as expected , only the correlated components survives to this operation .",
    "however , the added noise influences drastically the uncertainty on the measurement for a certain fixed number of images @xmath75 and thus the ability to assert the presence of the object .    in order to show that the quantum strategy outperforms the classical one , in figure  [ perr ] we report the error probability in the discrimination , @xmath79 , versus the number of photons of the thermal bath @xmath22 .",
    "the statement on the presence / absence of the object is performed on the basis of the covariance value obtained for a fixed number of images @xmath80 .",
    "thus , @xmath79 is estimated fixing the threshold value of the covariance that minimizes the error probability itself .",
    "figure  [ perr ] shows a remarkable agreement between the theoretical predictions ( lines ) and the experimental data ( symbols ) , both for qi and ci strategy .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath79 in the case of qi is several orders of magnitude below the ci one and , in terms of background photons , the same value of the error probability is reached for a value of @xmath22 at least 10 times larger than in the qi case .",
    "we have described in detail the model and the experiment addressed to quantum enhancement in detecting a target in a thermal radiation background in a relevant and realistic measurement scenario .",
    "our system shows quantum correlation with no external noise ( @xmath81 ) even in the presence of the losses introduced by the only partially reflective target .",
    "remarkably , even after the transition to the classical regime ( @xmath82 ) , the scheme preserves the same strong advantage with respect its natural classical counterpart based on classically correlated beams , as also suggested in @xcite .",
    "this apparent contradiction is explained by considering that quantum correlations actually survive unchanged up to the detector , where they are simply added to a independent noisy background .",
    "* moreover the quantum resources and the quantum enhancement achieved by the protocol can be precisely quantified by the generalized cauchy - schwarz parameter that is only related to the source properties @xmath66 . *    unlike other quantum enhanced measurement protocols , based on the experimental estimation of the first - moments of the photon number distribution , our scheme , which is based on the measurement of the second order momenta ,",
    "is impressively robust against losses .",
    "this derives from the fact that it does not require high level of two - mode squeezing ( @xmath63 in our experiment ) .",
    "for instance the quantum imaging protocol @xcite , where the signal is given by @xmath83 , provides a maximum improving factor of @xmath84 over classical techniques , that would correspond to 1.14 in our working condition in the absence of thermal * background*. also in exemplar quantum enhanced schemes , such as detection of small beam displacement @xcite and phase estimation by interferometry @xcite , it is well known that losses and noise can rapidly decrease the advantage of using quantum light @xcite , and typically high level of squeezing is necessary .",
    "this enforced inside the generic scientific community the common belief that the advantages of entangled and quantum state are hardly applicable in a real context , and they will remain limited to proofs of principle experiments in highly controlled laboratories , and/or to mere academic discussions .",
    "our work challanges this belief by demonstrating an advantage of orders of magnitude respect to ci protocol , independently on the amount of thermal noise and using devices available nowadays . in summary , we believe that the photon counting based qi protocol has a huge potentiality to foster the exploitation of quantum light based technologies in real lossy and noisy environment .    the research leading to these results has received funding from the eu fp7 under grant agreement n. 308803 ( brisq2 ) , fondazione sanpaolo and miur ( firb `` lichis '' - rbfr10yq3h , progetto premiale `` oltre i limiti classici di misura '' ) .",
