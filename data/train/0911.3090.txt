    "clio ( cryogenic laser interferometer observatory )  @xcite , is a prototype for the next japanese gravitational wave ( gw ) telescope project , lcgt ( large scale cryogenic gravitational - wave telescope )  @xcite , featuring the use of cryogenic mirrors and a quiet underground site . the main goal of clio is to demonstrate an improvement of sensitivity through a reduction of mirror thermal noise by cooling the sapphire mirrors .",
    "the design sensitivity is limited by the mirror thermal noise and the suspension thermal noise around 100hz , which will be reduced after cooling . through works on noise hunting",
    ", we achieved a thermal - noise - limited sensitivity at room temperature .",
    "one of main factors concerning the sensitivity improvement was to remove thermal noise due to a conductive coil - holder coupled with a pendulum through magnets .",
    "firstly , we report on the best displacement sensitivity we have achieved and noise hunting in recent works .",
    "next , we focus on verification of the thermal noise due to the coil - holder by theory and an experiment .",
    "clio is located in kamioka mine , which is 220 km from tokyo , and lies 1000 m underground from the top of a mountain .",
    "lcgt is planed to be constructed in this area .",
    "this underground site is suitable for interferometric gw detectors , because the seismic noise is less than that in an urban area by about 2 orders  @xcite .",
    "this merit is helpful to achieve the target sensitivity , and to obtain stability . owing to this advantage in low frequency ,",
    "observations for the vela pulsar was performed in 2007  @xcite .     schematic view of clio ; clio is a so - called locked fabry - perot interferometer , which has two 100 m fabry - perot cavities with a mode cleaner .",
    "the optics , like the lenses , the faraday - isolators , and some wave plates are omitted in this figure .",
    "abbreviations denote : eom , electro - optic modulator ; hwp , half wave plate ; qwp , quarter wave plate ; mmt , mode matching telescope ; and pbs , polarized beam splitter . ,",
    "width=491 ]    figure  [ fig : clio ] shows a schematic view of clio . a laser beam ( innolight inc .",
    "mephisto ) has a power of 2 watt and a 1064 nm wavelength .",
    "it is shaped into tem00 through a mode cleaner ( mc ) cavity with a length of 9.5 m , and then injected to two 100 m length fp cavities after being divided by a beam splitter .",
    "these cavities are arranged in an l - shape .",
    "all of the returned ( reflected ) beam from each arm cavity is extracted by an optical circulator formed by a @xmath0 plate and a polarized beam splitter .",
    "thus , this configuration does employ neither optical recombination by a michelson interferometer nor optical recycling schemes .",
    "the cavities are kept on resonance , called locked , by servo systems .",
    "the pound - drever - hall technique  @xcite is employed as a readout method for displacement signals of the mirrors . for that purpose ,",
    "the phase modulations at 15.8 mhz and 11.97 mhz are used for the arm cavities and the mode cleaner cavity , respectively .",
    "a multistage control system  @xcite is applied for laser frequency stabilization , which has two cascaded loops of the mc and an arm cavity .",
    "the inline arm is locked by controlling the frequency .",
    "the perpendicular arm is locked by controlling the mirror .",
    "a differential displacement between two arm cavities , which corresponds to gw signals , can be obtained from a feedback signal to the coil - magnet actuators .",
    "the four mirrors of the two arm cavities are individually suspended by 6-stage pendulums , which include 4-stage blade springs and 2-stage wire suspensions for isolation from any seismic vibration .",
    "the mirrors have weights of 1.8 kg ( end ) and 1.9 kg ( front ) , made of sapphire .",
    "they are suspended by bolfur  @xcite wires at the last stage , whose resonant frequency is 0.79 hz . the pendulum has a resonant frequency of a primary mode of about 0.5 hz . the angular alignments of all mirrors are tuned by movable stages on the suspensions .",
    "coil - magnet actuators are set for the front mirror in the perpendicular cavity only , so as to keep the optical path length of the cavity locked .",
    "until now , cryogenic systems have been developed  @xcite and progressed  @xcite . thus , cooling mirrors was realized  @xcite .",
    "all sapphire mirrors were cooled down to the required temperature of under 20 k. however , a thermal noise due to a conductive coil - holder , which appeared from 20 hz to 300 hz with a slope of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 was frequency ) prevented the sensitivity from reaching the thermal noises of suspensions and mirrors , at both room temperature and the cool temperature  @xcite .",
    "we could remove the extra thermal noise by noise hunting in recent works , and reached the design sensitivity at room temperature .",
    "clio displacement noise reached the predicted thermal - noise levels .",
    "figure  [ fig : best ] shows the improvement of the displacement noise in 2008 .",
    "the current best - floor sensitivity is @xmath3m/@xmath4 at 250 hz . in the frequency region of 20 hz to 80 hz , the spectrum is close to the suspension thermal noise , which comes from wire - material dissipations of the structure damping ( the internal damping  @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical prediction was calculated using the quality factor of a pendulum of @xmath5 , which was estimated from the measured violin q. the mirror thermal noise is also close to the sensitivity , and estimated from the bulk thermal noise of the thermoelastic damping .",
    "details of this progress and estimations will be described in an independent article  @xcite .",

    "the green doted line is the estimated suspension thermal noise from wire material dissipations using q - factors of the violin modes .",
    "the pink dash line indicates the calculated mirror thermal noise due to the substrate of the thermoelastic damping .",
    ", width=377 ]    the noise hunting of clio interferometer has progressed at room temperature .",
    "the improvement of the broad region from 20 hz to 300 hz came mainly from avoiding a kind of pendulum thermal noise due to eddy currents in a coil - holder induced by magnets glued onto the mirror .",
    "a beam centering adjustment also reduced noisy structures in this region . by adjusting the beam centering",
    ", we could reduce the length fluctuation of the cavities coupled with a mirror - angle fluctuation . in the high - frequency region , repairing the servo - circuits malfunction contributed to the reach of the shot noise . using thinner suspension wires made of bolfur",
    "whose diameters were changed from 0.1 mm to 0.05 mm , shifted the violin modes to higher frequencies , so as to separate the skirts of violin modes from the mirror thermal noise region .",
    "one reason for the improvement at around 10 hz was the removal of magnets on the upper mass for extended actuation , which had been shaken by damping magnets .",
    "the most contributed thing for improving the sensitivity was to identify the pendulum thermal noise due to a coil - holder with a slope of @xmath1 .",
    "let us emphasize that this is not the suspension thermal noise .",
    "the design sensitivity was calculated to be limited by the suspension thermal noise with a slope of @xmath6 , which comes from wire - material dissipations of the internal damping  @xcite . on the other hand , the thermal noise due to a coil - holder",
    "was caused by mechanical losses by eddy - currents in the conductive coil - holder coupled with a pendulum .",
    "the details are explained in the next section .",
    "pendulum thermal fluctuation is caused by several kinds of dissipations coupled with the whole pendulum .",
    "there are studies of those dissipations : an internal loss in the materials of suspension wires  @xcite , clamps of wires  @xcite , residual air  @xcite , coil - magnet actuators  @xcite , and a reference mass with coils  @xcite .",
    "the pendulum thermal noise due to the reference mass with coils ( the coil - holder in our case ) is the most interesting in this section .",
    "an oscillation of the pendulum gives rise to eddy currents by electromagnetic induction in the coil - holder .",
    "these currents generate joule heat in the material of the coil - holder . according to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt )  @xcite",
    ", the dissipation of the joule heat causes a thermal fluctuation of the pendulum through coupling with magnets glued onto the mirror .    a quality factor of the pendulum , caused by the losses of conductive materials ( reference masses ) near the magnets ,",
    "was derived  @xcite as @xmath7 which was verified by not only cagnoli  @xcite , but also frasca  @xcite . here ,",

    "the center of the magnet is placed at @xmath19 , and the length from the magnet to the edge of a conductor is @xmath20 .",

    "it is practicable to utilize a coil - magnet actuator coupling so as to estimate the magnetic moment . by using one coil - magnet actuator ,",
    "the force of @xmath27 can be applied for the test mass .",
    "the coupling factor , @xmath28 , is the conversion efficiency between the current , @xmath29 , in a coil - circuit and the force , @xmath30 .",
    "this coupling factor is related to the magnetic moment of a magnet by @xmath31 here , the solenoidal coil , which consists of a conductive wire with a diameter of @xmath32 , is wound around a bobbin with a radius of @xmath33 .",

    "one reason is a limitation of the coil - holder modeling .",
    "the estimated geometrical factor , @xmath14 , is more uncertain than the other parameters , because the previous coil - holder had a cubic shaped structure around a coil in spite of the calculation limited by the cylindrical shape from eq .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) .",
    "a picture of this coil - holder is shown in figure  [ fig : exchangeholder ] .",
    "we estimated @xmath14 to be a band line that has the lower limit of @xmath64 , and the upper limit of @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath14 of 5600 is the lower limit and an underestimate because it does not include volume of the cubic corner beyond the cylindrical shape with @xmath17 of 15 mm .",
    "@xmath14 of 9000 is approximation of the whole cubic , which corresponds to @xmath17 of a length from the center of the coil to a diagonal corner ( 21 mm ) .",
    "the upper limit is calculated as @xmath65 by adding the effect of the outer frame ( beyond the cubic around the coil ) assuming a plate ( @xmath66 mm , @xmath67 mm , @xmath68 mm and @xmath69 mm ) , which is rather an overestimate since the actual outer frame is not a plate shape .",
    "numerical simulation is needed for more precise estimation using j of the coil - holder with a complex shape .",
    "other reason is an error of the measured @xmath28 , which is about 10 % .",
    "the other reason is most likely a difference of bg noise in the region from 20 hz to 50 hz . in the `` before noise hunting '' , it is possible to inject the seismic noise via the coil - holder fixed on an optical stage or inject angular fluctuations of mirrors via an imperfection of a beam centering as mentioned in section 2.2 .",
    "we tested whether the sensitivity could be improved by replacing the coil - holder with an electrical isolator .",
    "figure  [ fig : diflonbobbin ] shows the result of that experiment . the sensitivity was improved by replacing the coil - holder .",
    "the settings of the clio interferometer were not changed in the test , except for the coil - holder .",
    "that is why the noise floor with the previous coil - holder can be regarded as being the thermal noise due to the coil - holder coupled with the pendulum . in this experiment , diflon bobbins ( not the `` new coil - holder '' in table  [ table1 ] and figure  [ fig:080515 ] )",
    "were employed so as to suppress eddy currents .",
    "the spectrum of the diflon bobbin was not employed as the bg noise in figure  [ fig:080515 ] because the bobbin was supported by aluminum plates with a complex shape , which did not perfectly suppress eddy currents .",
    "the aluminum was used as a material of the previous coil - holder for a reason of cryogenic compatibility as good thermal conduction .",
    "further , a precise and quantitative identification of the pendulum thermal fluctuation due to viscous damping was performed using coil - magnet actuators  @xcite .",
    "improvement of the sensitivity by replacing the coil - holder ; the coil - holder made of aluminum was replaced with diflon bobbins , which were an electrical isolator . , width=268 ]      the coil - holder was redesigned so that the pendulum could sufficiently avoid mechanical losses due to eddy currents in the coil - holder .",

    "the aluminum frame is separated from the magnets apart .",
    "the magnets were also changed from 2 mm to 1 mm of diameter , so that its magnetic moment could be reduced , and changed from nd - fe - b to sm - co of its material as a precaution against barkhausen noise .",
    "the current best sensitivity at room temperature as shown in figure  [ fig : best ] was accomplished in this coil - holder configuration .",
