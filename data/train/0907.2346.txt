    "is the nambu - goldstone spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking scheme confirmed in the low - energy limit of qcd ?",
    "the answer is positive : in the sector of light mesons , the effective field theory based on this scenario is in fact established as a quantitatively accurate science .",
    "one of the cornerstones in this development is the gell - mann , oakes , renner ( gor ) relation , @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the light quark masses , @xmath2 with @xmath3 is the chiral ( quark ) condensate and @xmath4 is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit . the chiral condensate , or alternatively , the pion decay constant act as order parameters for spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "the non - zero quark masses @xmath1 break chiral symmetry explicitly and move the pion from its massless goldstone boson limit to its actual physical mass .",
    "note that the quark masses and the chiral condensate are both renormalization scale dependent quantities whereas their product is scale invariant .",
    "the question is now whether the proportionality @xmath5 , characteristic of nambu - goldstone symmetry breaking , is actually confirmed . alternatively - as pointed out by j. stern et al .",
    "long ago - the next - to - leading @xmath6 term could in principle be sufficiently large so as to produce a linear relationship @xmath7 reminiscent of constituent quark models .",
    "recent lattice qcd computations with light dynamical quarks together with precision data on low - energy @xmath8 scattering now give consistent answers to this question @xcite .",

    "the nlo corrections involve two ( renormalized ) low - energy constants , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "lattice qcd determinations of these low - energy constants have now reached a remarkable level of precision , as evident from fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "these results confirm that the nlo corrections to eq.([gor ] ) are small as anticipated .",

    "the order parameter of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is the quark condensate .",
    "the disappearence of this condensate , by its melting above a transition temperature @xmath20 , signals the restoration of chiral symmetry in wigner - weyl realization .",
    "the transition from confinement to deconfinement in qcd is likewise controlled by an order parameter , the polyakov loop .",
    "a non - vanishing polyakov loop @xmath21 reflects the spontaneously broken @xmath22 symmetry characteristic of the deconfinement phase .",
    "the polyakov loop vanishes in the low - temperature , confinement sector of qcd .",
    "there is no principal reason why the deconfinement and chiral transitions should occur at the same temperature .",
    "nonetheless , recent results of lattice qcd thermodynamics @xcite with 2 + 1 flavors ( at zero baryon chemical potential ) indicate just that ( see fig.[fig:4 ] ) , with a common transition temperature @xmath23 mev . a deeper understanding of this observation is of fundamental importance , also in view of the fact that earlier lattice simulations @xcite still found a displacement between chiral and deconfinement temperatures ( although a more detailed assessment of systematic uncertainties might resolve this apparent contradiction ) .",
    "one notes that the chiral and deconfinement transitions as shown in fig.[fig:4 ] are not phase transitions but smooth crossovers , so there is no critical temperature in the strict sense .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to define a transition temperature band around the maximum slope of either the condensate @xmath24 or the polyakov loop @xmath25 .",
    "two limiting cases are of interest in this context . in pure gauge qcd , corresponding to infinitely heavy quarks , the deconfinement transition is established - at least in lattice qcd - as a first order phase transition with a critical temperature of about @xmath26 mev . in the limit of massless @xmath27 and @xmath28 quarks",
    ", on the other hand , the isolated chiral transition appears as a second order phase transition at a significantly lower critical temperature .",
    "this statement is based on calculations using nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) type models which incorporate the correct spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking mechanism but ignore confinement .",
    "the step from first or second order phase transitions to crossovers is understood as a consequence of explicit symmetry breaking . the @xmath22 symmetry is explicitly broken by the mere presence of quarks with non - infinite masses .",
    "chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by non - zero quark masses .",
    "but the challenging question remains how the chiral and deconfinement transitions get dynamically entangled in just such a way that they finally occur at a joint transition temperature interval .",
    "insights concerning this issue can be gained from a model based on a minimal synthesis of the njl - type spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking mechanism and confinement implemented through polyakov loop dynamics .",
    "this pnjl model @xcite is specified by the following action : @xmath29 \\nonumber\\\\ - { v\\over t}\\,{\\cal u}(\\phi , t)~.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it introduces the polyakov loop , @xmath30 with a homogeneous temporal gauge field , @xmath31 .",
    "its dynamics is controlled by a @xmath22 symmetric effective potential @xmath32 , designed such that it reproduces the equation of state of pure gauge lattice qcd with its first order phase transition at a critical temperature of 270 mev .",
    "the field @xmath33 acts as a potential on the quarks represented by the flavor doublet ( for @xmath34 ) or triplet ( for @xmath35 ) fermion field @xmath36 .",
    "the coupling of @xmath33 to the quark density @xmath37 is dictated by color gauge invariance .",
    "the hamiltonian density in the quark sector is @xmath38 , with the quark mass matrix @xmath39 and a chiral @xmath40 symmetric interaction @xmath41 .",
    "earlier two - flavor versions of the pnjl model @xcite have still used a local four - point interaction of the classic njl type , requiring a momentum space cutoff to regularize loops .",
    "a more recent version @xcite using a non - local interaction does not require any artificial cutoff .",
    "it generates instead a momentum dependent dynamical quark mass , @xmath42 , along with the non - vanishing quark condensate .",
    "a further extension to three flavors includes a @xmath43 breaking term implementing the axial anomaly of qcd .",
    "the non - local approach leads to a self - consistent gap equation @xmath44 for the dynamically generated quark mass , @xmath42 , starting from a small ( current ) quark mass @xmath45 .",
    "a typical result is shown in fig.[fig:5 ] .",
    "the running coupling strength of the non - local interaction @xmath41 represented by the distribution @xmath46 is chosen such that it matches qcd constraints on the quark mass function at high momentum and extrapolated lattice results at lower momentun , or the quark self - energy from dyson - schwinger calculations using landau gauge .",
    "using an instanton model is yet another option . the pseudoscalar meson spectrum together with the pion and kaon decay constants at zero temperature",
    "are well reproduced @xcite .",
    "resulting from the gap equation of the non - local pnjl model ( solid line ) .",
    "the dashed line shows a similar mass profile produced with an interaction kernel from an instanton model .",
    "lattice qcd data ( extrapolated to physical @xmath27 and @xmath28 quark masses ) are shown for comparison , as well as the step function mass profile ( with cutoff ) of the classic njl model .",
    "( figure adapted from ref.@xcite.),width=264 ]    with the input fixed at zero temperature , the thermodynamics of the pnjl model can then be investigated with focus on the symmetry breaking pattern and on the intertwining of chiral dynamics with that of the polyakov loop .",
    "the primary role of the polyakov loop and its coupling to the quarks is to cut down the residues of the thermal quark and diquark propagators , those that are non - singlets in color , when the transition temperature @xmath20 is approached from above .",
    "color singlets , on the other hand , are left to survive below @xmath20 .",
    "[ fig:6a ]        a remarkable dynamical entanglement of the chiral and deconfinement transitions is then observed , as demonstrated in fig.[fig:6 ] ( upper ) for the two - flavor case . in the absence of the polyakov loop",
    "the quark condensate ( left dashed line ) , taken in the chiral limit , shows the expected 2nd order chiral phase transition , but at a temperature way below and far separated from the 1st order deconfinement transition controlled by the pure - gauge polyakov loop effective potential @xmath32 ( right dashed line ) .",
    "once the coupling of the polyakov loop field to the quark density is turned on , the two transitions move together and end up at a common transition temperature around 0.2 gev .",
    "the deconfinement transition has turned into a crossover ( with @xmath22 symmetry explicitly broken by the coupling to the quarks ) , while the chiral phase transition remains 2nd order until non - zero @xmath27 and @xmath28 quark masses , @xmath47 mev , induce a crossover transition as well .",
    "the lower part of fig.[fig:6 ] shows the two - flavor pnjl result @xcite together with @xmath48 lattice data @xcite .",
    "a direct comparison is clearly not appropriate but the similarity of the crossover transition patterns is striking , given the simplicity of the model and the fact that these results are derived from a mean - field approach .",
    "a further important step is now to systematically investigate effects beyond mean field .",
    "undoubtedly a prime challenge in the physics of strong interactions is the exploration of the qcd phase diagram at non - zero baryon density , extending from normal nuclear matter all the way up to the large quark chemical potentials @xmath49 at which color superconducting phases presumably occur .",
    "pnjl calculations at finite @xmath49 give a typical pattern of the chiral order parameter as presented in fig.[fig:7 ] , showing a first order transition with a critical point ( cp ) .",
    "several important questions are being raised in this context .",
    "the first one concerns the existence and location of the critical point .",
    "extrapolations from lattice qcd , either by taylor expansions around @xmath51 @xcite or by analytic continuation from imaginary chemical potential @xcite , have so far not reached a consistent conclusion .",
    "a second question relates to the sensitivity of the first order transition line in the phase diagram with respect to the axial @xmath43 anomaly in qcd .",
    "this issue has been addressed in ref.@xcite and it was pointed out that , depending on details of the axial @xmath43 breaking interaction , a second critical point might appear such that the low - temperature evolution to high density is again just a smooth crossover , or the first order transition might disappear altogether and give way to a smooth crossover all over the place .",
    "an impression of the explicit dependence of the critical point on the axial anomaly can be obtained using the three - flavor pnjl model with inclusion of a @xmath43 breaking kobayashi - maskawa-t hooft determinant interaction and varying the coupling strength @xmath52 of this interaction @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the location of the critical point in the phase diagram varies indeed strongly with @xmath52 and may even disappear altogether below a certain value of @xmath52 ( see fig.[fig:8 ] ) .",
    "a closely related question is how the mass of the @xmath53 meson behaves in a dense baryonic environment .",
    "from the variety of existing model calculations ( including those using the pnjl model ) one might draw the presumably premature conclusion that critical phenomena occur already at densities not much higher than that of normal nuclear matter",
    ". however , all these models are not capable of working with the proper degrees of freedom around and below a baryon chemical potential of 1 gev ( corresponding to quark chemical potentials around 0.3 gev ) . approaching this density scale from below ,",
    "it is obvious that constraints from what we know about the nuclear matter equation of state must be seriously considered .",
    "chiral effective field theory is not only the low - energy realization of qcd in the meson and single - baryon sectors .",
    "it is also a basis for dealing with the nuclear many - body problem in terms of in - medium chiral perturbation theory @xcite . in this approach , chiral one- und two - pion exchange processes in the nuclear medium",
    "are treated explicitly while unresolved short - distance dynamics is encoded in contact terms .",
    "present calculations are performed up to three - loop order in the energy density .",
    "three - body interactions emerge and play a significant role in this framework .",
    "the pion mass @xmath57 , the nuclear fermi momentum @xmath58 and the mass splitting between nucleon and @xmath59 are all comparable scales and so the relevant , active degrees of freedom are pions , nucleons and @xmath60 isobars .",
    "intermediate range two - pion exchange interactions produce van der waals - like forces involving the large spin - isospin polarizablity of the individual nucleons .",
    "the pauli principle acts on intermediate nucleon states in two - pion exchange processes .",
    "this scenario leads to a realistic nuclear matter equation of state as presented in fig.[fig:9 ] , with a liquid - gas first order phase transition and a critical temperature of about 15 mev , close to the range of empirical values extracted for this quantity .",
    "we show this figure here primarily because it draws a picture of a well established part of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter at finite density and low temperature .",
    "given the truncation in the chiral expansion of the pressure in powers of the fermi momentum @xmath58 , these results can probably be trusted in the range @xmath61 gev , corresponding to baryon densities up to about twice the density of normal nuclear matter .",
    "equiped with such a nuclear equation of state based on chiral dynamics in which the pion mass ( or , equivalently , the quark mass according to the gor relation ( [ gor ] ) ) enters explicitly , one can now ask the following question : how does the chiral condensate extrapolate to baryon densities exceeding those of normal nuclear matter ?",
    "in - medium chiral effective field theory gives a definite answer : @xmath62 the first term with its leading linear dependence on density is the contribution from a free fermi gas of nucleons , with the pion - nucleon sigma term @xmath63 gev and non - static corrections .",
    "the term in the second line involves the pion mass dependence of the interaction energy per nucleon , @xmath64 .",
    "this term features prominently the two - pion exchange interaction in the nuclear medium including pauli principle corrections , and also three - nucleon forces based on two - pion exchange .",
    "the dashed - dotted curve in fig.[fig:10 ] shows the pronounced leading linear reduction in the magnitude of the chiral condensate with increasing density .",
    "this holds in the absence of correlations between the nucleons .",
    "up to about the density of normal nuclear matter , this term dominates , whereas the interaction part tends to delay the tendency towards chiral restoration when the baryon density is further increased .",
    "this behaviour is sensitive to the actual value of the pion mass . in the chiral limit , @xmath65 , with stronger attraction in the nn force at intermediate ranges ,",
    "the trend is reversed and the rapidly dropping condensate would now lead to the restoration of chiral symmetry at relatively low density : nuclear physics would look completely different if the pion were an exactly massless nambu - goldstone boson .",
    "the influence of explicit chiral symmetry breaking through the small but non - zero @xmath27 and @xmath28 quark masses on qualitative properties of nuclear matter is quite remarkable .",
    "these results demonstrate that known properties of a realistic nuclear equation of state must be considered as important constraints for extrapolations to higher densities , at least at low temperatures .",
    "pnjl type models work with quarks as baryonic quasiparticles .",
    "they do not account for those parts of the qcd phase diagram that prominently involve color singlet baryons as relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "the recent very interesting discussion @xcite of a quarkyonic sector in the phase diagram at moderate quark chemical potentials should not miss these constraints .",
