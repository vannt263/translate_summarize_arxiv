    "non - equilibrium critical phenomena arise in a broad variety of systems , including non - equilibrium growth models  @xcite , percolation - like processes  @xcite , kinetic ising models  @xcite , diffusion limited chemical reactions  @xcite , and driven diffusive systems  @xcite .",

    "we focus on the steady - state properties of such one - dimensional transport models , for which the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) has emerged as a paradigm ( for reviews see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "there , particles move unidirectionally from left to right on a one - dimensional lattice , interacting through on - site exclusion . the entrance / exit rates at the open left / right boundary control the system s behavior ; tuning them , one encounters different non - equilibrium phases for the particle densities  @xcite .",
    "intense theoretical research has been devoted to the classification of such non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "for example , within the context of reaction - diffusion systems , there is strong evidence that phase transitions from an active to an absorbing state can be characterized in terms of only a few universality classes , the most important being the one of directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite . to search for novel critical behavior ,",
    "fruitful results have been obtained by coupling two reaction - diffusion systems  @xcite , each undergoing the active to absorbing phase transition . due to the coupling ,",
    "the system exhibits a multicritical point with unusual critical behavior .",
    "we want to stress that already in equilibrium physics seminal insights have been gained by coupling identical systems .",
    "for instance , spin - ladders incorporate several heisenberg spin chains @xcite . there , quantum effects lead to a sensitive dependence on the chain number : for even ones a finite energy gap between the ground state and the lowest excitation emerges whereas gapless excitations dominate the low - temperature behavior if the number of spin chains is odd .    in this work ,",
    "we generalize the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) in a way that particles possess two internal states ; we have recently published a short account of this work in ref .",
    "@xcite . allowing particles to occasionally switch from one internal state to",
    "the other induces a coupling between the latter ; indeed , the model may alternatively be regarded as two coupled taseps . when independent , each of them separately undergoes boundary - induced phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "the coupling is expected to induce novel phenomena , which are the subject of the present work .",

    "the polarization of the electrons is controllable by a source for spin injection , a drain for spin extraction as well as a gate in the form of a tunable magnetic field that controls the strength of spin precession . in our model , this is mimicked by considering the spin - flip rate as a control parameter .",
    "the model is potentially relevant within biological contexts , as well . in intracellular traffic  @xcite",
    ", molecular motors walking on parallel filaments may detach from one lane and attach on another , resulting in an effective switching between the lanes . in our model , identifying the two internal states with different lanes , one recovers a transport model on two lanes with simple site exclusion . in the same way ,",

    "@xcite and references therein ) . in particular",
    ", novel phases have been discovered in the case of indirect coupling , i.e. the velocity of the particles depends on the configuration on the neighboring lane  @xcite .",
    "recently , models have been presented that allow particles to switch between lanes , and the transport properties have in part been rationalized in terms of an effective single lane tasep  @xcite . there",
    ", the case of strong coupling has been investigated : the timescale of lane switching events is the same as of forward hopping . in our model , we explicitly want to ensure a competition between the boundary processes and the switching between the internal states .",
    "we therefore employ a mesoscopic scaling , i.e. we consider the case where the switching events are rare as compared to forward hopping .",
    "this is the situation encountered in intracellular traffic @xcite where motors nearly exclusively remain on one lane and switch only very rarely . in the context of spin transport , it corresponds to the case where forward hopping occurs much faster than spin precession ( weak external magnetic field ) .",

    "we find that they agree excellently , suggesting the exactness of our analytic approach in the limit of large systems . as our main result , we encounter the polarization phenomenon , where the density profiles in the stationary non - equilibrium state exhibit localized ` shocks ' .",
    "namely , the density of one spin state changes abruptly from low to high density . the origin of this phenomenon is rationalized in terms of singularities in coupled differential equations",
    "we partition the full parameter space into three distinct regions , and observe a delocalization transition .",
    "the methods to calculate the phase boundaries analytically are developed simultaneously .",

    "our analytic approach identifies the phases where the polarization phenomenon occurs , as well as the continuous and discontinuous transitions that separate the phases .",
    "the nature of the transitions is explained by the injection / extraction limited current which is conserved along the track . as a second remarkable feature of the model ,",
    "we uncover multi - critical points , i.e. points where two lines of phase boundaries intersect or the nature of a phase transition changes from discontinuous to a continuous one .",
    "although multi - critical point are well - known in equilibrium statistical mechanics , a fundamental description for such a behavior for systems driven far from equilibrium still constitutes a major challenge .",
    "a brief summary and outlook concludes this work .",
    "in this section , we describe our model in terms of spin transport as well as two - lane traffic . though we will preferentially use the language of spins in the subsequent sections , the two - lane interpretation is of no lesser interest , and",
    "straightforwardly obtained .",
    "furthermore , we introduce two symmetries which are manifest on the level of the dynamical rules .",
    "we consider hopping transport on a one - dimensional lattice , composed of @xmath13 sites , with open boundaries , see fig .",
    "[ cartoon_spin ] .",
    "particles possess internal states , which we restrict to two different kinds ; adopting a spin notation , they are referred to as spin - up ( @xmath7 ) and spin - down ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "they enter at the left boundary at rates @xmath14 resp .",
    "@xmath2 , and move unidirectionally from left to the right through the lattice .",
    "the timescale is fixed by putting the rate for these hopping events to unity . within the bulk",
    ", particles may also flip their spin state , from spin - up to spin - down and back , at rate @xmath3 .",
    "finally , having reached the right boundary , particles may exit the system at rates @xmath15 resp .",
    "@xmath5 , depending on their spin state .",
    "we allow all of these processes only under the constraint of pauli s exclusion principle , meaning that every lattice site may at most be occupied by one particle of a given state .",
    "spin - up and spin - down thus may simultaneously occupy the same site , however two particles with identical spin polarization can not share a lattice site . in summary ,",
    "our dynamical rules are the following :    * at site @xmath16 ( left boundary ) , particles with spin - up ( spin - down ) may enter at rate @xmath14 ( @xmath2 ) * at site @xmath17 ( right boundary ) , particles with spin - up ( spin - down ) leave the lattice at rate @xmath15 ( @xmath5 ) * particles may hop at unit rate from site @xmath18 to the neighboring site @xmath19 for @xmath20 , i.e. within bulk * within bulk , particles can flip their spin state with rate @xmath3 , i.e. spin - up turns into spin - down and vice versa    always respecting pauli s exclusion principle .",
    "processes ( i ) to ( iii ) constitute the totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( tasep ) for the two different states separately , while rule ( iv ) induces a coupling between them . indeed , when the spin - flip rate @xmath3 vanishes , we recover the trivial situation of two independent taseps , while we will show that a proper treatment of @xmath3 through a mesoscopic scaling induces nontrivial effects .",
    "having introduced our model in the language of semi - classical spin transport , where pauli s exclusion principle is respected while phase coherence completely ignored , we now want to show that it also describes transport with site exclusion on two parallel lanes . as schematically drawn in fig .",
    "[ cartoon_two_lane ] , we consider two parallel lanes , each consisting of @xmath13 sites , labeled as upper lane ( i ) and lower lane ( ii ) . they are identified with the internal states of the particles considered before : a particle with spin - up ( spin - down ) now corresponds to a particle on lane i ( lane ii ) . the processes ( i ) and ( ii ) describe entering of particles at lane i ( ii ) at rate @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and exiting of lane i ( ii ) at rate @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . due to ( iii ) , particles hop unidirectionally to the right on each individual lane ;",
    "at rate @xmath3 , they may switch from lane i to ii and back .",
    "pauli s exclusion principle translates into simple site exclusion : all the above processes are allowed under the constraint of admitting at most one particle per site .",
    "again , we clearly observe that it is process ( iv ) that couples two taseps , namely the ones on each individual lane , to each other .      already on the level of the dynamical rules ( i)-(iv ) presented above ,",
    "two symmetries are manifest that will prove helpful in the analysis of the system s behavior .",
    "we refer to the absence of particles with certain state as holes with the opposite respective state  . considering their motion , we observe that the dynamics of the holes is governed by the identical rules ( i ) to ( iv ) , with `` left '' and `` right '' interchanged , i.e. with a discrete transformation of sites @xmath25 as well as rates @xmath26 .",
    "the system thus exhibits a _",
    "particle - hole symmetry_. even more intuitively , the two states behave qualitatively identical . indeed , the system remains invariant upon changing spin - up to spin - down states and vice versa with a simultaneous interchange of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , constituting a _ spin symmetry _",

    "+ when analyzing the system s behavior in the five - dimensional phase space , constituted of the entrance and exit rates @xmath29 and @xmath3 , these symmetries allow to connect different regions in phase space , and along the way to simplify the discussion .",
    "in this section , we shall make use of the dynamical rules introduced above to set up a quantitative description for the densities and currents in the system . within a mean - field approximation",
    ", their time evolution is expressed through one - point functions only , namely the average occupations of a lattice site .",
    "such mean - field approximations have been successfully applied to a variety of driven diffusive systems , see e.g. ref .",
    "we focus on the properties of the non - equilibrium steady state , which results from boundary processes ( entering and exiting events ) as well as bulk ones ( hopping and spin - flip events ) . both types of processes compete if their time - scales are comparable ; we ensure this condition by introducing a _",

    "furthermore , the parameter regions that allow for the formation of a localized domain wall have been considered .",
    "analytic phase diagrams for various scenarios , in particular the case of equal entrance rates , have been derived .",
    "the phase diagrams have been found to exhibit a rich structure , with continuous as well as discontinuous non - equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "the discontinuous one originates in the conserved particle current , which is either limited by injection or extraction of particles . at the discontinuous transition between both regimes ,",
    "delocalized domain walls emerge in the density profiles of _ both _ internal states .",
    "multicritical points appear at the intersections of different transition lines organizing the topology of the phase diagrams .",
    "two classes of multicritical points are identified , one of them arises only for sufficiently small gross spin - flip rate @xmath174 .",
    "the value @xmath143 , calculated analytically , provides a natural scale for the rate @xmath54 .",
    "it would be of interest to see which of the described phenomena qualitatively remain when generalizing the model to include more than two internal states .",
    "indeed , within the context of molecular motors walking on microtubuli  @xcite , between 12 and 14 parallel lanes are relevant .",
    "also , the internal states might differ in the sense of different switching rates from one to another  @xcite and the built - in asymmetry may result in different phases . in the context of intracellular transport it appears worthwhile to investigate the consequences of a coupling to a bulk reservoir , c.f .",

    "in this appendix , we give details on the derivation of the analytic solution of the mean - field approximation in the continuum limit to first order in @xmath64 , i.e. the system of differential equations ( [ cont_a ] ) , ( [ cont_b ] ) .    summing them we find @xmath198 ^ 2 + \\partial_x[2\\rho^\\downarrow(x_i)-1]^2=0\\ , , \\label{start}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such that @xmath199 ^ 2 + [ 2\\rho^\\downarrow(x_i)-1]^2=j\\ , , \\ ] ]",

    "we obtain the inverse function @xmath207 : @xmath208 here we defined the function @xmath209 by @xmath210 and @xmath211 is an constant of integration .    to obtain the inverse functions @xmath212 and @xmath213 , we have to express @xmath214 by @xmath215 resp .",
    "@xmath66 . recognize that @xmath214 can be positive or negative .",
    "we therefore define @xmath216 and analogously @xmath217 with @xmath7 and @xmath0 interchanged .",
    "now @xmath218 the inverse functions @xmath212 and @xmath213 thus read : @xmath219 the constants of integration @xmath211 and @xmath220 are determined by matching the boundary conditions .",

    "we are interested in the point @xmath126 , and thus in the right branch of the spin - up density profile . as the spin - down density is in the ld phase ,",
    "i.e. it is smaller than @xmath75 , we have @xmath221 in the above solution for @xmath215 .",

    "now , if this branching point lies on the right boundary , @xmath134 , as it does for the critical @xmath225 , this yields @xmath226 in eq .",

    "( [ x_rhoa ] ) , we obtain @xmath228 which for given @xmath229 is an equation for @xmath193 .",
    "in particular , @xmath193 is monotonically increasing in @xmath230 . investigating @xmath209",
    ", it turns out that @xmath209 is in turn increasing in @xmath231 .",
    "since @xmath231 is bounded from above by @xmath232 , the maximal value for @xmath209 is provided by @xmath233 .",
