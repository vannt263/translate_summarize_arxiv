    "percolation phenomena are ubiquitous in many aspects of natural , technological , and social sciences , and they arise when system - spanning clusters or components of , in some sense , connected objects form @xcite .",
    "a quantity of much interest is the percolation threshold , which marks the transition between the phase in which a giant component exists and the one in which it does not . in general , the percolation threshold is a nonuniversal quantity , as it depends on the connectivity properties of the specific system under consideration @xcite .",
    "for example , in continuum percolation systems , where objects occupy positions in a continuous space , the threshold depends on the shape of the objects @xcite , on their interactions @xcite , as well as on the connectedness criteria @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we consider the infinite - dimensional limit of a paradigmatic example of continuum percolation : the boolean - poisson model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "penetrable spheres with distributed radii have centers generated by a point poisson process , and any two spheres are considered connected if they overlap . for a given distribution of the radii ,",
    "the percolation threshold is given by the critical concentration @xmath7 of spheres , or by the critical volume fraction @xmath8 , such that a giant component of connected spheres first forms .",
    "precise numerical estimates of @xmath7 have been obtained in two and three dimensions for , respectively , disks and spheres with fixed or distributed radii @xcite .",
    "the general trend observed by these investigations is that @xmath7 depends on the form of the distribution function of the radii , and that it has its minimum when the sphere radii are monodisperse ( i.e. , when the spheres have identical size ) .",
    "this last point has been formally confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite , although it may not hold true in the limit of infinite dimensions @xmath0 @xcite .    here we show that for bounded distributions of the radii , that is for polydisperse spheres with a maximum finite value of the radius , the percolation threshold of the boolean - poisson model tends asymptotically to a universal constant as @xmath1 , provided that the radii distribution is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this constant coincides with the value found in refs .",
    "@xcite for spheres of identical radii , @xmath2 , and it is independent of the particular form of the size distribution function .",
    "we interpret the universality of @xmath7 as being due to the statistical irrelevance of the spheres with smaller radii : the onset of percolation is established effectively only by the subset of spheres with maximum radius .",
    "furthermore , we show that the mean number of connected spheres per particle at percolation , @xmath3 , is less than unity for polydisperse distributions of the radii , while @xmath4 only in the limit of identical radii .",
    "this finding is analogous to what simulations have shown for the case of continuum percolation in three dimensional space of spherocylinders with length polydispersity @xcite .",
    "these results rest on the observation that closed loops of connected spheres can be neglected in the limit of large dimensions , as we show explicitly for the case of bounded radii distributions . in the hypothesis that closed loops are irrelevant also for spheres of unbounded size , we show that @xmath7 for @xmath6 is not universal , as it depends on the parameters of the distribution , and that it can be smaller than the critical threshold of monodisperse spheres , in contrast to what is expected for finite dimensions @xcite .",
    "to construct the boolean model , we consider @xmath9 points placed independently and uniformly at random in a @xmath0-dimensional volume @xmath10 .",
    "each point is the center of a sphere with the radius drawn independently and randomly from a given probability distribution function @xmath11 . if we denote @xmath12 the number of spheres of radius @xmath13 , @xmath14 the number of spheres of radius @xmath15 , and so on , we can write the following without loss of generality : @xmath16 where @xmath17 with @xmath18 is the fraction of spheres of radius @xmath19 .",
    "given any two spheres of radii , say , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we assign a link between their centers if the spheres overlap , that is , if the distance @xmath21 between their center is smaller than @xmath22 , as shown in fig .",
    "we express this criterion for the formation of a link in terms of the connectedness function : @xmath23 where @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 is the unit step function .",
    "the set of sphere centers ( nodes ) and links ( edges ) forms a type of weighted random geometric graph , in which the probability that an edge between two nodes is formed is weighted by the sphere radii . to see this ,",
    "let us take a sphere of radius @xmath19 centered at the origin .",
    "the probability that a second sphere of radius @xmath20 forms a link with the first sphere is : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an infinitesimal @xmath0-dimensional volume element at the position @xmath30 of the sphere of radius @xmath20 , @xmath31 is the volume of a sphere of unit radius , and @xmath32 is the gamma function .",
    "we note that @xmath33 defines also the excluded volume @xmath34 in units of @xmath10 between two spheres of different radii .     and",

    "( b ) corresponding cluster formed by nodes ( sphere centers ) labeled by the sphere radii and weighted links ( solid lines ) connecting the nodes . ]",
    "an important aspect of the topology of random geometric graphs is represented by closed loops ( or cycles ) of connected nodes .",
    "the most studied loop quantity is the three - nodes cycle @xmath36 , often denoted the cluster coefficient , which gives the conditional probability that two nodes are connected given that both nodes are connected to a third one .",
    "@xmath36 has been calculated for systems of spheres with identical radii and for any dimensionality @xcite .",
    "the observation that @xmath36 vanishes exponentially as @xmath6 indicates that random geometric graphs in large dimensions have a locally tree - like structure .    using results from the theory of hard - sphere fluids , it is actually possible to show that , in the limit of large dimensions , closed loops are negligible also for any number of nodes and for bounded radii distributions .",
    "random and weighted random geometric graphs have thus tree - like structures when @xmath1 . to see this ,",
    "let us first consider the case of monodisperse spheres with radius @xmath37 .",
    "we define an @xmath38-chain graph as a cluster of @xmath39 nodes with @xmath40 edges such that every two consecutive edges , and only those , have a common node .",
    "we denote as end - nodes the two nodes of an @xmath38-chain that each have only one edge .",
    "the @xmath38-cycle coefficient @xmath41 is defined as the conditional probability that two nodes are connected given that they are the end - nodes of an @xmath38-chain .",
    "since the spheres have identical radii , we omit the subscripts in eq .  , and we write the connectedness function as simply @xmath42 . from the definition of @xmath41 ,",
    "we can thus write : @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "besides a prefactor , the above expression coincides with the cluster integral of a ring of @xmath38 hard - spheres of radius @xmath37 @xcite , as the mayer function @xmath45 for a fluid of hard - spheres is just @xmath46 @xcite . to evaluate eq .   for @xmath6",
    ", we thus use known results from the theory of hard - sphere fluids in infinite dimensions . noting that the denominator of eq .",
    "( i.e. , the @xmath38-chain contribution ) is simply @xmath47 @xcite , where @xmath48 is the excluded volume for spheres of identical radius @xmath37 , and introducing the fourier transform @xmath49 of the connectedness function we rewrite eq .   as : @xmath50 the integration in eq .   for @xmath6 has been worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) , so that the @xmath38-cycle coefficient reduces to : @xmath51^{d/2},\\ ] ] from which we see that closed loops of any number @xmath38 of nodes are exponentially small as @xmath6 , because the quantity within square brackets is less than unity for @xmath39 .",
    "let us now consider the @xmath38-cycle coefficient for the case of polydisperse spheres .",
    "using eq .",
    "for the connectedness function , we generalize eq .   as follows : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 denotes a multiple average over the radii @xmath55 . in the appendix",
    ", we show that for bounded distributions of radii , the @xmath38-cycle coefficient in the limit @xmath6 is such that : @xmath56 where @xmath41 is the @xmath38-cycle coefficient for identical radii , eq .  , and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a nonnegative constant .",
    "since the exponential decay of @xmath59 for @xmath6 is stronger than the power - law increase of @xmath60 , we see thus that also for the case of polydisperse spheres for bounded radii distributions , the @xmath38-cycle coefficient vanishes for any @xmath39 .",
    "the observation made in the previous section that closed loops are irrelevant in the large dimensional limit of the boolean model allows us to consider the components of the associated weighted random geometric graph as effectively having a tree - like structure .",
    "this leads to a considerable simplification , as we can take the formalism of the theory of random graphs ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and generalize it to the case in which nodes have weights .",
    "we start by considering the multidegree distribution of a node of type @xmath61 , defined as the probability @xmath62 that a sphere of radius @xmath19 is connected to @xmath63 spheres of radius @xmath13 , @xmath64 spheres of radius @xmath15 , and so on .",
    "since the radii are randomly and independently distributed among the @xmath9 nodes , @xmath62 is just a product of binomial distributions @xmath65 ( with @xmath66 ) , each giving the probability that @xmath67 spheres of radius @xmath20 overlap the sphere of radius @xmath19 : @xmath68 with @xmath69 where @xmath70 ( with @xmath66 ) is the number of spheres of radius @xmath20 , @xmath33 are the overlap probabilities given in eq .  ,",
    "and @xmath71 is the kronecker symbol .",

    "( [ binomial2 ] ) reduces to a poisson distribution : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the average number of spheres with radius @xmath20 that overlap a given sphere of radius @xmath19 .",
    "in addition to the node degree distribution @xmath62 , for the following analysis we will also need the excess node degree distribution @xmath77 , defined as the conditional probability that a sphere of radius @xmath20 is connected to @xmath78 spheres of radius @xmath79 ( with @xmath80 ) , given that it is connected to a sphere of radius @xmath19 .",
    "this task is simplified by the irrelevance of closed loops in the large dimensionality limit . in this case , indeed , if we select at random an edge connecting a node of type @xmath81 with a node of type @xmath61 , the @xmath81 node attached to the edge is @xmath82 times more likely to have degree @xmath82 than degree @xmath83 with nodes of type @xmath61 .",
    "its degree distribution will thus be proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "the excess degree distribution of a @xmath81 node that has @xmath82 edges with nodes of type @xmath61 other than the edge with the node @xmath61 to which is attached is thus @xcite : @xmath85 where @xmath86 . from eqs .   and",
    ", @xmath87 reduces simply to : @xmath88 where we have used @xmath89 .",
    "equation states thus the well - known property that the excess degree distribution coincides with the node degree distribution when this is poissonian @xcite .",
    "we exploit now the statistical irrelevance of closed loops discussed in sec .",

    ", we shall first keep the form of the degree distributions unspecified , and apply eqs .   and only at the end of the calculation .",
    "let us start by considering a randomly selected node that has probability @xmath91 of being occupied by a sphere of radius @xmath19 .",
    "due to the general tree - like structure of the graph , the cluster to which the selected node belongs is formed by branches attached to the node according to the degree distribution @xmath92 , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "the mean size @xmath93 of the cluster to which the selected node belongs is thus : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the mean cluster size of one of the @xmath67 branches attached to the selected node .",
    "since the clusters have a tree - like structure , @xmath95 is given by the mass ( unity ) of one neighbor of the selected node , plus the mean cluster size of each of the remaining subbranches attached to the neighbor .",
    "to find @xmath95 , we thus need the excess degree distribution @xmath77 of a sphere of radius @xmath20 connected to the selected node of type @xmath61 : @xmath96    , @xmath15 , and @xmath35 .",
    "each node label corresponds to the value of the radius of the sphere attached to the node . ]",
    "equations and are quite general , as they apply also to tree - like graphs with degree distributions that are not reducible to a multiplication of poissonian probabilitites .",
    "interestingly , similar equations are found in the calculation of finite size components of multigraphs ( also denoted multiplex networks ) , formed by different networks , each having particular node properties , coupled together @xcite . the boolean - poisson model with random radii",
    "can thus be viewed also as a particular type of multigraph , in which each individual network is constituted by nodes occupied by spheres of a given radius .",

    "cluster statistics are often studied using the formalism of pair - connectedness correlation functions @xcite , which exploits well developed techniques of liquid state theory .",
    "this method has been recently used to studying percolation of monodisperse spheres in large dimensions @xcite .",

[ oz ] , and we extend to the polydisperse sphere case the inequality formulated in ref .",

    "the above expression applies to any dimensionality , and following ref .",

    "we have considered random dispersions of penetrable @xmath0-dimensional spheres with distributed radii in terms of weighted random geometric graphs , where nodes represent sphere centers and edges connect nodes of overlapping spheres with probability weighted by the sphere radii . for bounded distribution of the radii , we have shown that closed loops of connected spheres can be neglected in the limit @xmath6 and that graph components have thus tree - like structure .",
    "analysis of the mean cluster size reveals that the asymptotic percolation threshold is universal and coincides with the threshold @xmath156 found for the case of monodisperse spheres in high dimensions .",
    "this result confirms and extends a previous finding on the percolation of @xmath6 spheres with two different radii @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we show that the asymptotic critical connectivity per particle @xmath3 , though dependent on the shape of the radii distribution function , is less than unity and approaches @xmath4 for spheres of identical radii .",
    "we have also studied critical connectivity for spheres with radii distributed according to a @xmath0-independent lognormal function , which is a treatable example of unbounded distribution . assuming that clusters have a tree - like structure , we find that the percolation threshold @xmath7 depends on the shape of the log - normal distribution and , interestingly , that @xmath7 for @xmath1 can be smaller that the threshold for monodisperse spheres , in contrast to what is expected at finite dimensions @xcite .    before concluding ,",
    "let us speculate on the percolation threshold in homogeneous fluids of polydisperse spheres with impenetrable cores ( cherry - pit model @xcite ) . in finite dimensions ,",
    "correlations between the cores preclude writing the multi - degree distribution as a product of poisson distributions , as done in sec .",
    "[ multi ] , because the @xmath9-particle distribution function @xmath251 depends on the relative positions of the core centers @xcite .",
    "however , in the limit of infinite dimensions and for small densities , @xmath251 asymptotically factorizes into a product of @xmath252-functions that are unity for pair distances beyond the hard - core diameter @xcite .",
    "the multi - degree distribution for @xmath6 can thus still be written as a product of poisson distributions , with the average number of contacts unaltered by the presence of the hard - cores if the penetrable shells are non - vanishing . with the same reasoning ,",
    "closed loops are expected to be negligible and graphs are still dominated by tree - like components . for non - zero penetrable shells , therefore we expect the same asymptotic results for @xmath7 as those obtained for the case of penetrable hyperspheres .",

    "in this appendix , we show that when the radii distribution is independent of @xmath0 and bounded [ that is , when @xmath159 for any @xmath160 , with @xmath158 ] , the @xmath38-cycle coefficient for polydisperse spheres , defined in eqs .  - , vanishes for @xmath6 .",
