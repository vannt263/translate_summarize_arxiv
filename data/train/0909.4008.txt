    "the component @xmath103 is smooth if and only if the poincar polynomial of @xmath42 is palindromic .",
    "recall that , among classical varieties , schubert varieties share this property that their singularity is characterized by the non - symmetry of the distribution of betti numbers ( proved by carrell and peterson @xcite ) .    note",
    "also that an algebraic variety for which the poincar duality fails is in particular rationally singular ( see for example ( * ? ? ?",

    "specifically theorem [ second - crit ] , it is natural to ask whether a singular component can always be characterized by the fact that its distribution of betti numbers is non - symmetric , implying that it does not satisfy the poincar duality .",
    "the first example of a singular component apart from the two - column case is the component @xmath42 corresponding to the tableau @xmath812 ( see @xcite ) .",
