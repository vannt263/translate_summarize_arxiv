    "this paper studies the existence and properties of stationary solutions to langevin equations driven by a noise process @xmath0 with , in general , stationary dependent increments .",
    "we shall refer to such solutions as quasi ornstein ",

    "when this is possible it often provides a more direct and simpler access to the character and properties of the process ; for instance , concerning the autocovariance function .",
    "this will be demonstrated in applications to the case where the noise process @xmath0 is of the pseudo - moving - average kind , including fractional brownian motion and , more generally , fractional lvy motions . of some particular interest for turbulence theory",

    "another non - semimartingale case covered is @xmath1 where the processes @xmath2 are brownian motions in different filtrations and @xmath3 is a measure on some space @xmath4 .    in recent applications of stochastics , particularly in finance and in turbulence ,",
    "modifications of classic noise processes by time change or by volatility modifications are of central importance ; see barndorff - nielsen and shephard @xcite and barndorff - nielsen and shiryaev @xcite and references given therein .",
    "prominent examples of such processes are @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is brownian motion and @xmath7 is a predictable stationary process  for instance , the square root of a superposition of inverse gaussian ornstein  uhlenbeck processes ( cf .",
    "barndorff - nielsen and shephard @xcite and barndorff - nielsen and stelzer @xcite )  and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a lvy process and @xmath10 is a time change process with stationary increments ( cf .",
