    "the study of polynomial assignments was initiated by ginzburg , guillemin , and karshon ( @xcite ) in conjunction with abstract moment maps , as a method of understanding geometric information from underlying combinatorial data of group action on manifolds .",

    "equivariant cohomology classes in @xmath13 can also be represented as maps from @xmath9 to @xmath2 ; the subalgebra of maps that represent equivariant cohomology classes is denoted by @xmath14 .",
