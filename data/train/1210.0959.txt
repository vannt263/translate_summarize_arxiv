    "here we consider a single - server queue fed by @xmath0 arrival streams , each corresponding to a distinct job class . upon arrival , each job declares its service time and deadline requirements .",
    "if a job does nt enter service within the deadline time of its arrival , it abandons the queue before initiating service .",
    "otherwise it remains in queue until it receives its full service time requirement .",
    "nonabandoning jobs are served in a nonidling , first - in - first - out ( fifo ) fashion .",
    "the queue is assumed to be overloaded , i.e. , the offered load exceeds one . in addition , it is assumed that the interarrival times , service times , and deadline times are mutually independent sequences of independent and identically , but generally distributed random variables .",
    "one aim of this work is to provide approximations for functionals such as the queue - length process .",
    "queueing systems with abandonment are observed in many applications .",
    "hence , it is a natural phenomenon to study . for fifo single - server queues with abandonment , the earliest analysis focused on models with exponential abandonment  @xcite , which is not an ideal modeling assumption .",
    "thereafter , general abandonment distributions were considered in  @xcite , which restricted to markovian service and arrival processes . shortly thereafter",
    ", stability conditions were determined in  @xcite without the markovian restriction . in the last decade",
    ", there has been considerable progress with analyzing the critically loaded fifo single - server queue with general abandonment @xcite .",
    "here we focus on general abandonment for the multiclass overloaded fifo single - server model described above .    in  @xcite , jennings and reed study the workload process associated with this queue under the assumption that the abandonment distributions are continuous .",
    "note that the workload process is well defined since each job declares its deadline upon arrival .",
    "in particular , the value of the workload process is increased by a job s service time at its arrival time if and only if the value of the workload process immediately before the job s arrival is strictly less than the job s deadline time . as usual",
    ", the value of the workload decreases at rate one while the workload is positive . under mild conditions ,",
    "they establish both a functional law of large numbers and a functional central limit theorem for this process .    in this paper",
    ", we build on that work .",
    "one outcome is to provide a fluid approximation for the vector - valued queue - length process .",
    "because the abandonment distributions are not necessarily exponential , the queue - length vector together with the vector of residual interarrival times , class in service , and residual service time does not provide a markovian description of the system state .",
    "additional information about the residual deadline times is also needed .",
    "we track this information using a measure - valued state descriptor , which is defined precisely in section  [ sec : sm ] .",
    "we give an informal description here .",
    "the state @xmath1 of the system at time @xmath2 consists of @xmath0 finite , nonnegative borel measures on @xmath3 , one for each class , where @xmath4 denotes the nonnegative real numbers .",
    "each measure consists entirely of unit atoms , one corresponding to each job of that class in the system .",
    "the coordinates of each atom are determine by two quantities associated with the job .",
    "the first coordinate is the residual virtual sojourn time of that job , which is the amount of work in the system ( the cumulative residual service times of jobs that do nt abandon ) associated with this job and the jobs that arrived ahead of it .",
    "the second coordinate is the residual patience time .",
    "this is given by the job s deadline minus the time in system if it will abandon before entering service , and is given by the job s deadline plus its service time minus the time in system otherwise .",
    "note that the atoms associated with jobs that will eventually be served are initially located in @xmath3 above the line of slope one intersecting the origin , while the atoms associated with jobs that wo nt be served are initially placed on or below this line . with this description ,",
    "new jobs arrive and the corresponding unit atoms are added at the appropriate coordinates of the system state .",
    "further , each coordinate of each atom decreases at rate one until the unit atom reaches one of the coordinate axes and exits the system .",
    "jobs associated with atoms that hit the vertical coordinate axis exit due to service completion .",
    "jobs associated with atoms that ultimately hit the horizontal coordinate axis exit due to abandonment ( see figure  [ fig : state ] ) .",
    "our choice of state descriptor is reminiscent of the one used by gromoll , robert , and zwart  @xcite to analyze an overloaded processor sharing ( ps ) queue with abandonment .",
    "one distinction is that their work is for a single - class queue , and therefore has one coordinate rather than @xmath0 .",
    "another is that the first coordinate for the unit atom associated with a given job in the ps system is simply the job s residual service time .",
    "we use the residual virtual sojourn time to determine the first coordinate since it captures the order of arrivals , which is needed for fifo .",
    "the evolution of the state descriptor in  @xcite is slightly more complicated than the one used here . in both cases",
    ", the residual patience times decrease at rate one , but in @xcite the service times decrease at rate one over the number of jobs in the queue .",
    "hence , the nice relationship with the line of slope one intersecting the origin present in the fifo model is not present in the ps model . however , in both models it is true that hitting a coordinate axis corresponds to exiting the system with the vertical axis being associated with service completion and the horizontal axis being associated with abandonment .",
    "so this work provides an example of how the modeling framework developed for analyzing ps with abandonment can be adapted to yield an analysis in another abandonment setting .",
    "measure valued processes have been used rather extensively for modeling many server queues with and without abandonment ( see  @xcite , and  @xcite ) .",
    "an important distinction between single - server and many server first - come - first - serve queues is that the later is not first - in - first - out .",
    "therefore the measure valued descriptor and analysis given here is quite different from that found in the many server queues literature .",
    "we develop a fluid approximation for this measure - valued state descriptor , which yields fluid approximations for the queue - length vector and other functionals of interest . similarly to the approximations derived in  @xcite and  @xcite , these approximations depend on the entire abandonment distribution of each job class .",
    "we begin by introducing an associated fluid model , which can be viewed as a formal law of large numbers limit of the stochastic system .",
    "hence fluid model solutions are @xmath0-dimensional measure - valued functions with each coordinate taking values the space of finite , nonnegative borel measures on @xmath3 that satisfy an appropriate fluid model equation ( see ) .",
    "we analyze the behavior of fluid model solutions . through this analysis",
    "we identify a nonlinear mapping from the fluid workload to the fluid queue - length vector ( see ) . using the nature of fluid model solutions ,",
    "this mapping is refined to yield the approximations for the number of jobs of each class in queue that will and will not abandon ( see and ) . in a similar spirit",
    ", we obtain approximations for the number of jobs of each class in system of a certain age or older ( see and ) .",
    "in addition , we characterize the invariant states for this fluid model ( theorem  [ thrm : is ] ) .",
    "next we justify interpreting fluid model solutions and functionals derived from them as first order approximations of prelimit functionals in the stochastic model by proving a fluid limit theorem ( theorem  [ thrm : flt ] ) .",
    "it states that under mild assumptions the fluid scaled state descriptors for the stochastic system converge in distribution to measure - valued functions that are almost surely fluid model solutions .",
    "a basic element of our fluid limit result is the nature of the scaling employed .",
    "consistent with the framework in  @xcite , we accelerate both the arrival process and the service rates , while leaving the abandonment times unchanged .",
    "one should think of a concomitant speeding up of the server s processing rate to accommodate the increased customer demand ; the content of the work for any particular customer is the same .",
    "we assume any given customer is unaffected by the increase in the number of fellow customers , but rather it is the time in queue that triggers abandonment .",
    "hence , abandonment propensity does not require adjusting as the other system parameters increase .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we conclude this section with a listing of our notation .",
    "the formal stochastic and fluid models are given section  [ sec : m ] .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : main ] , we present the main results ( theorems [ thrm : eu ] ,  [ thrm : flt ] and  [ thrm : is ] ) and several approximations derived from our fluid model . theorems  [ thrm : eu ] and  [ thrm : is ] are proved in section  [ sec : prfthrmeu ] . in the final two sections , we provide the proof of theorem  [ thrm : flt ] .",
    "the proof of tightness is presented in section  [ sec : tightness ] , while the characterization of fluid limit points as fluid model solutions is presented in section  [ sec : char ] . for this",
    ", we prove a functional law of large numbers for a sequence of measure - valued processes that we refer to as residual deadline related processes ( see lemma [ lem : resdeadflln ] ) .",
    "since the residual deadline related processes do nt include information about the service discipline , the result in lemma  [ lem : resdeadflln ] may be of more general interest for analyzing queues with abandonment .",
