    "classical ramsey problems typically involve breaking a given ambient set up into disjoint subsets called color classes , then looking for conditions under which a given configuration will be present in one of the color classes . here",
    ", we consider so - called anti - ramsey or _ rainbow _ problems .",
    "rainbow problems have been studied in different contexts ; see @xcite and @xcite and the references therein for some arithmetic rainbow results , and see @xcite and @xcite and the references therein for results in graph theory .",
    "here we consider unit equilateral triangles whose vertices come from distinct color classes .",
    "the author would like to thank janos pach and hans parshall for helpful suggestions greatly improving the content of this paper .",
    "one of the largest motivating questions for this is the unit distance problem , due to erds , in @xcite . in short , given a large finite number , @xmath0 , what is the maximum number of times that two points can exactly a unit distance apart in a set of @xmath0 points in the plane ?",
    "the current record of @xmath1 was achieved by spencer , szemer ' edi , and trotter in @xcite .",
    "people have studied similar questions involving triangles and higher - order simplices .",
    "see the wonderful survey book by brass , moser , and pach , @xcite .",
    "the plane is not the only setting where such questions can be considered however . in @xcite , iosevich and rudnev considered distance problems in vector spaces over finite fields .",
    "of course , they used an analog of distance , as vector spaces over finite fields do not admit euclidean distances as such .",
    "there has been much activity in this area as people have considered related problems involving simplices , in @xcite , specifically triangles , in @xcite , and other functionals , such as dot products , in @xcite .",
    "specifically their initial result states that if one has a large enough subset of a vector space over a finite field , then there must be two points in that subset that are a given distance apart .",
    "we can think of this as a two - point configuration where the two points come from the same subset . in what follows",
    ", we will be looking for three - point configurations , where the three points all come from distinct sets .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is a large , odd , prime power .",
    "consider the two - dimensional vector space over the finite field with @xmath2 elements , @xmath3 in this setting , a common analog of euclidean distance is the following functional , @xmath4 defined by @xmath5 which we shall , by abuse of language , call a  distance . \"",
    "see @xcite , by iosevich and rudnev , for good introduction to this notion of distance .    also , given two functions , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we use the symbol @xmath8 to denote that @xmath9 similarly , we use @xmath10 if @xmath8 and @xmath11 occasionally , we will use the letter @xmath12 to represent a constant .",
    "this should be clear by context .",
    "also , we will frequently use the notation @xmath13 to mean that @xmath6 grows faster than a constant with respect to the parameter .",
    "note that regardless of whether we are in @xmath14 or @xmath15 , it is easy to see that if each point has a different color , every equilateral triangle will be rainbow .",
    "we first prove a simple result , proposition [ size2 ] , with straightforward combinatorial methods as an introduction to the main result , theorem [ main ] .    [ size2 ] given a coloring of @xmath14 or @xmath15 where no color class has more than two points , if there exist unit equilateral triangles , there must be a rainbow unit equilateral triangle .",
    "the main result should be seen as an asymptotic result in @xmath2 .",
    "that is , suppose we have a family of colorings of @xmath16 , for some sequence of @xmath17 tending to infinity",
    ". then the constant , @xmath12 , mentioned below should be independent of @xmath17 .",
    "[ main ] given a coloring of @xmath15 , where no color class has size greater than @xmath18 for any positive constant , @xmath12 , if there exist unit equilateral triangles , then there must be a rainbow unit equilateral triangle .",
    "theorem [ main ] does not work if we have only a constant number of colors .",
    "it seems as though one should be able to prove a stronger result , some absolute constant , @xmath12 .",
    "however , any such result would have to somehow deal with the relative sizes of the color classes , as the following degenerate example shows .",
    "color @xmath15 by giving each point of the form @xmath19 , with @xmath20 a distinct color that is nt blue , and coloring the rest of the points blue .",
    "clearly , none of the pairs of non - blue points are a unit distance apart , so any unit equilateral triangle in this coloring will have at least two blue points .",
    "consider the vertices of any unit equilateral triangle .",
    "if they are three different colors , then we are done .",
    "if not , call the two vertices that are the same color @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and call the third vertex @xmath23 . note that @xmath23 is a different color than @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as there are no more than two points of any color .",
    "now , there is a unique point , @xmath24 , that forms an equilateral triangle with @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , there is a unique point , @xmath25 , that forms an equilateral triangle with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is not possible for both @xmath24 and @xmath25 to be the same color as @xmath23 , so there must exist a rainbow unit equilateral triangle .",
    "[ fig1 ]   +",
    "first , there is a minor technical point alluded to in the statement of theorem [ manycolorstech ] , namely that there are vector spaces over finite fields for which no unit equilateral triangles exist . for our purposes ,",
    "the existence of unit equilateral triangles is equivalent to the presence of an element @xmath26 such that @xmath27 this will also guarantee that every pair of points a unit distance apart must determine exactly two unit equilateral triangles , a fact which we often take for granted in the euclidean setting .",
    "we state this precisely as a special case of lemma 4.1 from @xcite .",
    "[ lem1 ] if there exists an element , @xmath26 such that @xmath28 , then for any pair of points , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , there exist two other points of @xmath15 , @xmath31 and @xmath23 , such that @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the vertices of unit equilateral triangles .        the outline of the proof is as follows : we begin with two simple counting arguments for constructing a relatively evenly distributed  sub - coloring \" of our original coloring , and then prove a result for colorings where each class roughly the same size .",
    "these results are asymptotic in the size of the ambient set .",
    "define a * fair * @xmath34-coloring of a set @xmath35 , of size @xmath36 , to be a @xmath34-coloring where there exists an @xmath37 such that each color class has between @xmath38 and @xmath39 elements .",
    "notice that this is more relaxed than the related notion of an equinumerable @xmath34-coloring , where each color class must have size either @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "suppose we have a @xmath34-coloring of a set , @xmath35 .",
    "now , for any @xmath42 , we will say that a @xmath43-coloring * refines * the original @xmath34-coloring if for every color class from the @xmath43-coloring is contained in a color class from the @xmath34-coloring .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath44 , and our 2-coloring color classes are @xmath45 and @xmath46 . then the 3-coloring @xmath47 and @xmath48 would be a refinement of the 2-coloring , but the 3-coloring @xmath49 would not be .    [ greedy ]",
    "suppose @xmath35 is a set with @xmath36 elements , and we @xmath50-color it so that no color class has greater than @xmath51 elements , for any positive constant @xmath12",
    ". then there exists a fair @xmath43-coloring of @xmath35 for some @xmath52 for which the original coloring is a refinement .",
    "the next lemma says that if @xmath53 , and we have a fair @xmath43-coloring of some set , then for some @xmath54 , with @xmath55 , we can use it to generate a fair @xmath34-coloring of the same set , for which the original coloring is a refinement .",
    "both the statement and the proof are similar to that of lemma [ greedy ] , but there are enough subtle differences that we state and prove it separately .",
    "[ manycolors ] given a fair @xmath43-coloring of a set @xmath35 of size @xmath36 , and @xmath56 , with @xmath57 there exists a fair @xmath34-coloring of @xmath35 for some @xmath58 with @xmath59 , for which the original coloring is a refinement .",
    "we begin with a coloring of @xmath15 , where no color class has size greater than @xmath61 , for any constant @xmath12 .",
    "so , we apply lemma [ greedy ] with @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , and get a fair @xmath43-coloring of @xmath64 for some @xmath65 , for which the original coloring is a refinement .",
    "that is , if two points are in different color classes in the new coloring , then they came from different color classes in the original coloring , though the converse may not hold .",
    "now , we would like to apply lemma [ manycolorstech ] to this new coloring directly , but there is a technical constraint to the methods employed in lemma [ manycolorstech ] that requires us to have rather large color classes .",
    "luckily , lemma [ manycolors ] tells us that we can coarsen our coloring again to get a suitable coloring . specifically , we set @xmath66 , and apply lemma [ manycolors ] to our fair @xmath43-coloring of @xmath15 .",
    "applying lemma [ manycolors ] in this way guarantees us a fair @xmath34-coloring of @xmath15 with @xmath67 and @xmath58 satisfying the hypotheses of lemma [ manycolorstech ] . as such",
    ", we are guaranteed the existence of an equilateral triangle , each of whose vertices comes from a different color class in our newest coloring . again",
    ", this new coloring respects the original coloring in the sense that points from distinct color classes in this new coloring will be in distinct color classes in the original coloring , so this equilateral triangle is rainbow in the original coloring as well .",
    "essentially , lemma [ greedy ] says that if we have a sequence of sets , @xmath68 , with each @xmath69 , with @xmath70 , and a sequence of colorings , where we @xmath71-color the set @xmath68 , then if the @xmath71 grow with @xmath72 , then we can always find a fair @xmath73-coloring of each @xmath68 , for some @xmath73 that grows faster than a constant .",
    "consider the sequence of the rings of integers of @xmath2 elements , @xmath74 , with @xmath2 tending to infinity .",
    "suppose that each ring element not equal to 0 or 1 is colored by the largest prime divisor of its corresponding integer , and give 0 and 1 their own color .",
    "so the element 6 in each ring will be given the color 3 .",
    "letting @xmath2 tend to infinity , we see that this is a coloring scheme with no color class larger than @xmath75 , and also with more than @xmath76 color classes for any constant @xmath12 .",
    "lemma [ greedy ] shows that there is a fair @xmath43-coloring for some @xmath43 that grows faster than a constant with @xmath2 , for which our original coloring is a refinement .    to prove this",
    ", we will check to see if our coloring is already a fair @xmath50-coloring .",
    "if so , set @xmath77 , and we are done . if not , we will put two color classes together into a  super - color , \" and check again .",
    "as the argument is iterative , we will use superscripts on the sets to keep track of which iteration we are on .    label the color classes @xmath78 , so that the disjoint union @xmath79 and so they are indexed ( after a possible relabeling ) in non - increasing order , @xmath80 set @xmath81 , the size of the biggest color class(es ) . by assumption , @xmath82 for any positive constant @xmath12 .",
    "now , if all of the color classes are of size between @xmath83 and @xmath84 , we are done by the definition of a fair coloring .    if not all of the color classes live within this range",
    ", then we know that the bound violated is the lower bound , as no set is larger than @xmath31 , by definition .",
    "so we take the last two sets , @xmath85 and @xmath86 and relabel their union as @xmath87 .",
    "now there are two possible outcomes .",
    "if @xmath88 then because the sets were labeled in non - increasing order , we have that @xmath89 since @xmath90 and @xmath91 , @xmath92 combining and give us that our new coloring is fair .",
    "since no set has more than @xmath93 elements , we have that for any positive constant , @xmath12 , each color class of the new coloring has fewer than @xmath94 elements . by the pigeonhole principle",
    ", we must have @xmath43 colors , where @xmath95 , and we are done .",
    "keep repeating the above procedure .",
    "clearly , the original coloring refines each new coloring , as the new color classes are just unions of old color classes .",
    "there are only finitely many color classes , so the process must stop at some point .",
    "notice that the size of the largest color class will remain @xmath31 throughout each iteration , except possibly the final step , so no color class will ever have a positive proportion of @xmath35 , and our final coloring will have all of the claimed properties .        from the definition of fair colorings",
    ", there must be a natural number , @xmath102 , such that each color class has size between @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "suppose that the color classes are called @xmath106 , where @xmath107 , and that they are labeled in non - increasing order , so that @xmath108    now , let @xmath109 define @xmath110 to be the union of the sets @xmath111 where @xmath112 , for some constant @xmath25 , so that @xmath113 , but @xmath114 that is , pack as many of the largest color classes together as we can without the size exceeding @xmath115 define @xmath116 in a similar manner , as the union of the next @xmath117 sets , where @xmath118 , for some constant @xmath119 so that @xmath120 , but @xmath121    continue this method of construction for the sets @xmath122 and so on .",
    "let @xmath123 be the last such set with @xmath124 now , if @xmath125 then we are done , as we set @xmath126 , and the @xmath127 form a fair @xmath34-coloring meeting all of the requirements above .",
    "however , it is possible that there are some sets , @xmath128 left over , whose union is strictly less than @xmath129    if this is the case , we keep the sets @xmath130 as before , but go back and define @xmath131 to be the union of the next @xmath132 sets , where @xmath133 , for some constant @xmath134 so that @xmath135 , but @xmath136 define @xmath137 to be the union of the remaining sets .",
    "now , we know that the size of @xmath137 is less than @xmath138 so we set @xmath139 , and the sets @xmath140 and @xmath137 form a fair @xmath34-coloring meeting all of the requirements above",
    ".      in what follows , we use @xmath141 to indicate various constants , independent of @xmath2 , that we do not compute . enumerate the color classes , and call each one @xmath106 , where @xmath142 by the definition of a fair @xmath34-coloring",
    ", there exists a natural number , @xmath143 such that that each color class has between @xmath38 and @xmath39 points . to prove lemma [ manycolorstech ]",
    ", we will assume that there are no rainbow unit equilateral triangles , and use this assumption to derive a bound on @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , if this bound is violated , then we must be guaranteed the existence of a rainbow unit equilateral triangle .",
    "now , lemma [ lem2 ] tells us that there are @xmath145 pairs of points that are a unit distance apart , and lemma [ lem1 ] tells us that each such pair is a part of exactly two unit equilateral triangles . putting these together with the fact that each triangle has three sides , each of which requires a pair of points , tells us that the number of unit equilateral triangles is approximately @xmath146 times the number of unit distances .",
    "so we can say that there are @xmath147 unit equilateral triangles in total , regardless of color .",
    "we will suppose that each of these unit equilateral triangles has at least two points from the same color class , which would imply that there are no rainbow unit equilateral triangles in our coloring .",
    "define @xmath148 to be the largest number of pairs of points from any set of @xmath0 points in @xmath15 , that are a unit distance apart .",
    "that is , @xmath149        lemma [ ud ] tells us that @xmath154 whenever @xmath155 now , define @xmath156 to be the total number of pairs of points that are both the same color , and separated by a unit distance .",
    "since each of the @xmath34 color classes can contribute no more than @xmath157 point pairs to @xmath156 , we have that @xmath158 combining this with our bound on @xmath148 yields @xmath159    but keep in mind that each of our @xmath147 unit equilateral triangles must have a pair of points from the same color class , so we have a lower bound for @xmath156 as well , namely @xmath160 combining upper and lower bounds on @xmath156 , and estimating @xmath0 by @xmath161 ( the possible error here is smaller than the buried constants ) tells us @xmath162 @xmath163    this tells us that as long as @xmath164 and @xmath55 , we must have a rainbow unit equilateral triangle . as before , we estimate @xmath0 by @xmath165 ( the possible error here is , again , buried in the constants ) to get the condition that @xmath166 @xmath167                  d. hart , a. iosevich , d. koh , s. senger , i. uriarte - tuero , _ distance graphs in vector spaces over finite fields _ , bilyk , dmitriy , et al . ,",
