    "sequences , such as unimodular or low peak - to - average power ratio ( par ) , have many applications in both single - input single - output ( siso ) and multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) communication systems . for example , the @xmath0-ary phase - shift keying techniques allow only symbols of constant - modulus , i.e. , unimodular , to be transmitted @xcite . in mimo radars and code - division multiple - access ( cdma ) applications ,",
    "the practical implementation demands from hardware , such as radio frequency power amplifiers and analog - to - digital converters , require the sequences transmitted to be unimodular or low par @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the design of optimal unimodular or low par sequences for channel estimation .",
    "there is an extensive literature on designing single unimodular sequences with good correlation properties such that the autocorrelation of the sequence is zero at each nonzero lag . as such properties are usually difficult to achieve , metrics of `` goodness '' have been proposed instead where autocorrelation sidelobes are suppressed rather than literally set to zero , and optimization problems are thus formulated and solved with numerical algorithms @xcite .",
    "specifically , the work @xcite provides several cyclic algorithms ( ca ) for either minimizing integrated sidelobe level ( isl ) or maximizing isl - related merit factor ( mf ) . in @xcite , a computationally efficient algorithm called misl for minimizing isl is proposed , and it is demonstrated that misl results in lower autocorrelation sidelobes with less computational complexity .    the good correlation property of a single unimodular sequence is also extended to mimo systems , where multiple sequences are transmitted .",
    "the good autocorrelation is defined for each sequence as that for a single sequence .",
    "meanwhile , good cross - correlation demands that any sequence be nearly uncorrelated with time - shifted versions of the other sequences . in @xcite",
    ", algorithms ca - direct ( cad ) and ca - new ( can ) are developed to obtain sequence sets of low auto- and cross - correlation sidelobes .",
    "also @xcite proposes some efficient algorithms to minimize the same metric in @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned isl and isl - related metrics are both alternative ways to describe the impulse - like correlation characteristics .",
    "sequences with such properties enable matched filters at the receiver side to easily extract the signals backscattered from the range bin of interest and attenuate signals backscattered from other range bins @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , matched filters take no advantage of any prior information on the channel when the unimodular low - isl sequences are used for estimation .",
    "the unimodular constraint is actually a special case of the low par constraint , which imposes how the largest amplitude of the sequence compares with its average power .",
    "the low par constraint , as a structural requirement , has been well studied in the design of tight frames @xcite .",
    "although the individual vector norms of a frame could be adjusted to maximize the sum - capacity of ds - cdma links , the optimality in terms of any performance measures was not directly considered therein .",
    "furthermore , the algorithm they proposed is based on alternating projection that often suffers a slow convergence .",
    "as far as channel estimation is concerned , many studies have been conducted for both frequency - flat and frequency - selective fading channels under minimum mean square error ( mmse ) estimation and conditional mutual information ( cmi ) maximization .",
    "most of those obtained optimization problems , however , only address the power constraint without addressing the unimodular or low par constraints . in @xcite , training sequence design for flat mimo channels",
    "is studied assuming some special structures , e.g. , kronecker product , on the prior covariance matrices of channel and noise .",
    "it is shown that the optimization problem can be reformulated as power allocations using the majorization theory , and the waterfilling solutions are obtained .",
    "meanwhile , problems of similar formulations have also been studied in joint linear transmitter - receiver design @xcite . to deal with arbitrarily correlated mimo channels ,",
    "some numerical algorithms based on block coordinate descent are proposed in @xcite .",
    "more related to our work is training sequence design for frequency - selective fading channels . under a total power constraint , channel capacity",
    "is investigated for siso channels @xcite and mimo channels @xcite .",
    "independent and identically distributed channel coefficients and noise are assumed to facilitate mathematical analysis . as a result ,",
    "impulse - like sequences for both types of channel are suggested for optimal estimation .",
    "optimal design for the mmse channel estimation has been studied in @xcite , where the noise is assumed to be white and the channel taps are uncorrelated ; however , such assumption is hardly satisfied in practice . and",
    "there is no guarantee of finding an optimal solution for an arbitrary length of training or channel correlation .",
    "more important , their results can not be used when the unimodular or low par constraint is imposed on the sequences to be designed .",
    "we formulate the problem as the design of optimal unimodular sequences based on the mmse and the cmi .",
    "both problems are non - convex with the bothersome unimodular constraint . without assuming any amenable structures , e.g. , kronecker product , on the prior channel and noise covariances",
    ", the problems are also challenging even if only the power constraint is imposed . to tackle those issues ,",
    "the majorization - minimization ( mm ) technique is employed to develop efficient algorithms . by rewriting the objective functions in a more appropriate way ,",
    "majorizing / minorizing functions can be obtained for minimization / maximization objective . as a result",
    ", the original problems are solved instead by a sequence of simple problems , each of which turns out to have a closed - form solution .",
    "convergence of our proposed algorithms is guaranteed , and an acceleration scheme is also given to improve the convergence rate .",
    "for low par constraints , similar problems can be formulated , and the developed algorithms need only a few modifications to be applied .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : channel_problem ] , the channel model is described , on which the optimal unimodular sequence design problems are formulated . in section [ sec : algorithms_for_optimal ] , derivations of algorithms for both the mmse minimization and the cmi maximization are presented , followed by a brief analysis of convergence properties and an acceleration scheme .",
    "the optimal design under the low par constraints is discussed in [ sec : opt_seq_par ] .",

    "the good correlation properties are particularly desired in that the matched filter is employed in subsequent channel estimation . as a matter of fact , the obtained channel estimate is closely related to maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimation .",
    "assume the vectorized noise in the channel model follows a circularly complex gaussian distribution , @xmath44 .",
    "minimizing the mean square error ( mse ) @xmath45 results in the ml channel estimate @xcite @xmath46 where the second equality is due to @xmath47 . and",
    "the corresponding error is given by @xmath48 to minimize the error of ml estimation , the training sequence should be a solution to the optimization problem @xmath49    [ lemma1 ] let @xmath50 be such that @xmath51 for some constant @xmath52 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath53 is achieved when @xmath54 , provided that inverse of @xmath55 exists .",
    "an approximation to problem is as follows .",
    "according to lemma [ lemma1 ] , the objective function is minimized when ( @xmath56 ) @xmath57 if only the energy constraint is considered .",
    "therefore , a heuristic approximation of the ml optimal sequence design could be formulated as @xmath58    the optimal @xmath59 satisfying   portrays an impulse - like correlation shape pursued in @xcite , where the aperiodic cross - correlation is defined as @xmath60 for @xmath61 and lags @xmath62 .",
    "equation also defines the autocorrelation for the sequence of each transmit antenna when @xmath63 .",
    "accordingly , the correlation matrices for different lags @xmath64 are given by @xmath65 with @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "let us define the correlation matrix for a sequence @xmath59 as @xmath68 and then we have @xmath69 note that @xmath70 only describes correlations at lags of interest , which in this case is determined by the length of the channel impulse response . to achieve the optimality dictated by , we can rewrite approximation problem as @xmath71 the objective function of is indeed the weighted correlation minimization criterion within the lag interval @xmath72 @xcite , for which algorithms wecan and cad were proposed .",
    "another formulation is also presented in a similar attempt to procure the good correlation property as @xmath73 for which an algorithm called can was developed in @xcite , and wecan can be employed as well . in @xcite , both problems and were studied by considering a more general weighted formulation , and efficient algorithms were proposed .",
    "we can see that sequences with good auto- and cross - correlation properties are desirable in general as no prior information on the channel is taken into account in the ensuing channel estimation task .",
    "channel statistics , however , are often available on both the transmitter sides and receiver sides , and incorporating those priors into the design of the training sequence will improve the performance of channel estimator . in the following subsections",
    ", we will formulate the unimodular sequence design problem based on the mmse minimization and the cmi maximization , both of which have been adopted as criteria in various estimation problems . in order for the channel model   to be general , we assume @xmath74 , and the noise @xmath75 , where both the channel covariance @xmath76 and the noise covariance @xmath77 are arbitrary .      given the channel model , by minimizing the mse @xmath78 , the mmse estimator of the channel impulse @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "and the error covariance matrix is @xmath82 where the last equality is due to the matrix inversion lemma @xcite .",
    "the mmse is thus given by @xmath83 and the following problem can be formulated @xmath84 which gives the optimal unimodular training sequence for the mmse channel estimation .",
    "apart from the mmse criterion , another popular statistical measure in channel estimation is the conditional mutual information ( cmi ) between the channel impulse response and the received sequence , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the cmi is defined as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the differential entropy of a distribution @xcite . under the linear model with gaussian distributed channel impulse and noise",
    ", we have the conditional distribution @xmath87 .",
    "then @xmath88 can be written as @xmath89 by maximizing @xmath88 we reach the following optimization problem @xmath90{cc }      \\label{eq : cmi_prob }          \\underset{\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{s}}{\\text{maximize } } & \\mathrm{cmi}\\left(\\mathbf{s}\\right)\\end{array}\\begin{array}[t]{cc }          \\text{subject to } & \\mathbf{s}=\\mathcal{t}\\left(\\mathbf{u}\\right),\\mathbf{u}\\in\\mathcal{u}.      \\end{array}\\ ] ]    _ remark _ : it should be mentioned that channel model includes the siso channel as a special case .",
    "a lot of efforts have been made to construct unimodular sequences for siso channels via either analytical methods or computational approaches .",
    "apart from early works on binary sequences and polyphase sequences , e.g. , @xcite , numerical algorithms are provided to design unimodular sequences of good correlation properties @xcite .",
    "let @xmath91 and @xmath92 denote the training sequence , then @xmath93 is a toeplitz convolution matrix and expression reduces to a scalar that gives autocorrelations at different lags for the sequence @xmath92 . and similar formulations as and",
    "are proposed in order to obtain sequences of good autocorrelation properties . however , as we have seen in the previous discussion , the resulting channel estimate can not benefit from the available knowledge of channel statistics .",
    "therefore , designing optimal training sequences by minimizing the mmse criterion or maximizing the cmi criterion will be beneficial in terms of final estimation performances . without any modifications , formulations and can be deployed in the context of siso channels .",
    "in this section , we develop efficient algorithms to solve problems and .",
    "there is an extensive literature dealing with optimization problems of similar objective functions with only power constraint on @xmath59 where , assuming some special structure for the prior covariance matrices of channel and noise , the problems are reformulated as power allocation with waterfilling - like solutions . in our formulations , however , it is not only the toeplitz structure of @xmath59 but also the tough unimodular constraint that prevents us from adopting the same approach .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a possible approach to problem is a two - stage procedure @xcite related to correlation shaping .",
    "if the channel noise is independent and identically distributed , i.e. , @xmath94 for some power density @xmath95 , the objective function becomes @xmath96 where the second equality follows from substitution of the correlation matrix @xmath97 .",
    "consider only the constraint @xmath98 induced by the energy budget in , minimizing with respect to @xmath70 ( instead of @xmath59 ) can be rewritten as an sdp by resorting to the schur - complement theorem @xcite , which yields the optimal correlation matrix @xmath99 .",
    "once @xmath99 is obtained , the problem boils down to recovering sequences from its correlation matrix , which is to solve the following approximation problem @xmath100 if zero error is achievable . for a single sequence and without the unimodular constraint ,",
    "problem can be tackled by means of filter design @xcite . however , constructing a unimodular sequence that presents a prescribed correlation shape is challenging . as a special case ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have studied this problem only when the correlation matrix is an identity . on the other hand",
    ", it is not guaranteed that the objective in can reach zero when minimized .",
    "for example , when the number of sequences is relatively large for the training length , it is impossible to design sequences such that correlation matrix is an identity , i.e. , auto- and cross - correlation can not be made small simultaneously @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is advisable to solve problems and directly with the colored noise considered . in the following",
    ", we will devise algorithms for both problems based on the majorization - minimization framework .",
    "the majorization - minimization , or mm method is a general framework for solving an optimization problem indirectly . in this section",
    ", we will briefly introduce the idea of the mm method for a minimization problem , and the details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the mm method tackles a difficult optimization problem by solving a series of simple approximation problems .",
    "given a minimization problem @xmath101 and a feasible starting point @xmath102 , the mm method minimizes a sequence of surrogate functions @xmath103 instead .",
    "each surrogate function is a majorization function of @xmath104 at @xmath105 that satisfies : @xmath106 and @xmath107 according to the rules and , we have @xmath108 and consequently , the mm method produces a sequence of points @xmath105 , for which the original objective function of is monotonically decreased .",
    "provided that the objective function is bounded below , it is guaranteed that the mm algorithm will converge to a stationary point .",
    "the key question is then how to find a good majorization function @xmath109 such that the resulting problems are easy to solve .",
    "although there is no universal rule to determine the function @xmath109 , the structure of the problem at hand can nevertheless provide helpful hints and some tricks are suggested in @xcite .",
    "let us introduce @xmath110 , and by the objective function for the mmse minimization problem can be written as @xmath111    [ lemma2 ] the function @xmath112 is a matrix fractional function and is jointly convex in @xmath113 and @xmath7 @xcite .    by lemma [ lemma2 ]",
