    "study of the spin degree of freedom is an important problem not only for fundamental physics , but for practical applications also , in view of the last advances of nanotechnologies and promising perspectives of the new branch of electronics called spintronics . of the special interest",
    "is spin behaviour in quasi - two - dimensional structures , such as layered semiconducting heterostructures , quantum wells ( qw ) and surface states of compounds widely used in modern micro- and nanoelectronics . in these systems there",
    "exist such phenomena as band spin splitting , or rashba effect @xcite , spin hall effect etc .",
    "these phenomena are caused by spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) , which is manifested when particles propagate in an inhomogeneous potential .",
    "therefore , the detailed study of the spin degree of freedom , the very existence of which is the direct consequence of the dirac equation ( de ) , is important .    many problems of solid state electronics are usually studied within the schrdinger equation ( se ) taking into account soi which appears in the hamiltonian as the relativistic thomas correction after the transition in de to the non - relativistic limit @xcite .",
    "this correction takes the simplest form of the soi operator in the case of a spherically symmetric field , and the form of rashba soi for two - dimensional ( 2d ) carriers in the field of a plane well .",
    "it is generally assumed that se with soi operator describes all possible cases of entangling of coordinate and spin variables .",
    "worth noting that de does not include a separate term responsible for soi .",
    "its appearance in the nonrelativistic approximation reflects the fact of the hidden coupling between the particle s degrees of freedom in the de .",
    "the corresponding relation results from the fact that spatial and spin coordinates are not separated in the de .",
    "this is very clear if one searches the solution of the de for a free particle in the system of eigen functions that is consistent not with the momentum operator , but with the operator of the total angular momentum .    to study",
    "how complete is the description of the spin degree of freedom within the nonrelativistic approximation , the solution of the de for electrons in the field of the plane qw was recently analysed in @xcite with the subsequent consideration of nonrelativistic energies .",
    "it has been found , somehow unexpected , that there are _ four _ independent solutions which correspond to also four different eigen spin states with different spin polarisations  in other words , with different axes of spin momentum quantization  and with different characters of soi manifestation .",
    "nonetheless , from the mathematical point of view there is nothing strange in this , according to the theory of linear differential equations .",
    "indeed , the de is , in fact , the system of four equations for the components @xmath0 of the dirac bispinor . in the external potential which varies in one direction only ( for instance , along @xmath1-axis )",
    ", when the space in the two other directions is homogeneous , particle states can be characterized by certain value of the 2d momentum @xmath2 .",
    "then the dependence of the wavefunction on the spatial coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 is determined by the standard exponential term @xmath5 , and de transforms into the system of four ordinary differential equations for functions @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) of one variable . in this case",
    "one can find exactly four linear mutually independent sets of functions @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , which represent the solution of the latter system of equations @xcite .",
    "such linearly independent solutions form _ the fundamental system _ of solutions . for the system of solutions found in @xcite ,",
    "the wronskian is nonvanishing , @xmath10 , what unambiguously witnesses that the solutions are linearly independent .",
    "thus , the solutions found in @xcite represent the fundamental system of solutions of the de .",
    "any linear combination of them with arbitrary coefficients is also the solution of the de @xcite .",
    "such a solution of the system of equations is called _ general _ , and , naturally , should contain some free parameters , whose variation continuously transforms one solution into another .    in view of the fact that different solutions correspond to different spin states ,",
    "such a variation of the free parameters means an arbitrary rotation of the spin polarization , which in its turn leads to the appearance of soi different for each state .",
    "this is why it is important to find namely the general solution , or in other words , the solution with free parameters , when considering the de for the specific physical situation .",
    "such a solution , being a unique one , independently on the existence of the spin invariants , would allow to determine conditions at which a specific spin state is realized , and , hopefully , would open new possibilities of the control of the spin degree of freedom .",
    "below we consider quasi-2d electrons kept by an asymmetric qw , and find the general solution of the de .",
    "the effect of their spin polarization on the energy spectrum is also analysed .",
    "let us consider the stationary de for electrons in an external potential : @xmath11 \\psi = e \\psi \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the light velocity , @xmath13 is particle mass , @xmath14 is momentum operator , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 are dirac matrices , @xmath19 is a unit matrix , @xmath20 is an external potential , and @xmath21 is a bispinor which is a four - component function of spatial coordinates .",
    "below , unlike in our previous paper @xcite , we will not explore the fact that there are the spin operators which commute with the hamiltonian , but will use another approach .    in layered structures",
    "the potential varies in one direction , only , so that @xmath22 with @xmath1-axis chosen perpendicular to the layers . in this case , as we have stressed above , the integrals of motion are the two projections of particle momentum in the @xmath23-plane , and the state of a particle with the given value of a 2d wavevector @xmath24 is described by the wavefunction @xmath25 substituting function ( [ psi_2d ] ) into eq .",

    "consequently , in the nonrelativistic limit spin and spatial coordinates of a particle prove to be separated . in other words ,",
    "spin orientation is not manifested in energetic spectrum or other observables in the absence of external fields ( electric and/or magnetic ) .",

    "in particular , in the field which preserves free propagation of a particle in two directions and restricts it in the third one , the spin orientation determined by free parameters , can be arbitrary , according to the found above general solution , but 2d electron energy spectrum ( [ cale_2d ] ) does depend on the spin .",
    "such energy dependence on the spin variable reflects the manifestation of the soi which appears in the se .",
    "the specific form of the soi is the consequence of the account of relativistic corrections . even being small ones , they lead to qualitative consequences .    to demonstrate the possibilities of the description of qualitatively different characteristics of electrons in heterostructures with the help of general solution of the de ,",

    "2c ( @xmath110 , @xmath332 ) we show the case when the projection of spin pseudovector @xmath333 is preserved ( for instance , the projection on @xmath256-axis ) . in this case",
    "bychkov - rashba parameter becomes anisotropic , and , respectively , spin splitting becomes anisotropic too .",
    "figure 2 shows the simplest cases .",
    "any arbitrary situation can be described by the general solution , in which one has to set certain values to the corresponding free parameters : for different physical situations certain _ a priori _ free parameters can be fixed .",
    "the essential benefit of the general and unique solution found in the present paper , is the possibility of continuous transition from one to another physical situation via continuous change of the corresponding free parameters .",
    "the resulting spin splitting and spin orientation schemes will have more complex geometry , than shown in fig .",
    "the above general solution describes the states of one isolated electron .",
    "realization ( `` preparation '' ) of a specific spin state is , however , determined by another factors , such as carrier concentration , presence of electric or / and magnetic field(s ) , applied pressure , properties of particular interface etc .",
    "therefore , spin states should be manifested as the peculiarities of real physical experiments .    in equilibrium systems",
    "the main requirement is the total energy minimum .",
    "for instance , for ideal 2d electron gas containing @xmath334 electrons , the total ground state energy is @xmath335 where @xmath336 are occupation numbers of one - electron energy levels ( [ cale_2d ] ) . at zero temperature @xmath337 at @xmath338 and @xmath339 at @xmath340 with @xmath341 being the fermi energy . for the states , shown in fig .",
    "2 , it is easy to find that @xmath342 and @xmath343 here @xmath344 is the surface electron density , @xmath345 is the maximum electron density at which the lowest spin sub - band is occupied and the upper sub - band is unoccupied .",
    "the lowest spin sub - band has the minimum at @xmath346 .",
    "thus , in the equilibrium 2d electron gas , the rashba state is realized as the lowest one .",
    "the presence of perturbations which destroy the isotropy of a 2d layer , can be taken into account by choosing certain values of the free parameters of the general solution , and , therefore , one can hope that the situation is not exclusive , when the lowest energy state is different from the rashba state .",
