    "since globally defined lipschitz mappings have good rademacher type differentiability properties , it is a matter of general interest to provide extension theorems for partially defined lipschitz mappings . in this context , the following concept is useful : a pair of metric spaces @xmath4 is said to have the _",
    "lipschitz extension property _",
    "if there exists a constant @xmath5 such that any lipschitz mapping @xmath6 , @xmath7 , has a lipschitz extension @xmath8 with the property that @xmath9 . here , we used the notation @xmath10 and similarly for @xmath11 .",
    "there is a long history of results providing examples of metric pairs @xmath4 with or without the lipschitz extension property .",
    "the first such result is due to mcshane  @xcite who proved that for an arbitrary metric space @xmath12 , the pair @xmath13 has the lipschitz extension property , even with constant @xmath14 .",
    "this result was followed by the theorem of kirszbraun  @xcite who proved the lipschitz extension property , also with constant @xmath14 , for pairs of euclidean spaces @xmath15 .",
    "kirszbraun s theorem was generalized by valentine  @xcite to pairs of general hilbert spaces @xmath16 .",
    "the lipschitz extension problem becomes more challenging if the target space @xmath17 has no linear structure .",
    "an generalization of the kirszbraun ",
    "valentine theorem to metric spaces with a curvature bound in the sense of alexandrov was established by lang and schroeder  @xcite , and the case of an arbitrary metric space @xmath12 and a hadamard manifold @xmath17 was discussed in  @xcite . in the paper of lang and schlichenmaier  @xcite , a general sufficient condition for the lipschitz extension property of a metric pair @xmath4 is given .",
    "the lipschitz extension property for a pair of general carnot groups @xmath18 with their canonical sub - riemannian carnot - carathodory metrics is studied for particular pairs of carnot groups in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the situation is fully understood for the pair @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the euclidean space of dimension @xmath2 and @xmath21 is the heisenberg group of topological dimension @xmath22 . in this case , it is known that the pair @xmath19 has the lipschitz extension property if and only if @xmath23 . the `` only if '' part of this equivalence is due to balogh and fssler  @xcite , whereas the `` if '' part is due to wenger and young  @xcite .    in this note , we shall study the lipschitz extension property for pairs of heisenberg groups @xmath24 , a question that was posed in  @xcite .",
    "let us observe first that since @xmath0 contains isometric copies of @xmath25 , it follows from  @xcite that if @xmath24 has the lipschitz extension property , then we must necessarily have that @xmath23 .",
    "the reason of this restriction on dimensions is as follows : it is a well - known fact of sub - riemannian geometry that smooth lipschitz mappings between sub - riemannian spaces must satisfy the _ contact condition_. this means that the horizontal distribution defining the sub - riemannian metric must be preserved by the tangent map .",
    "this property gives an obstruction for the existence of smooth lipschitz extensions .",
    "this principle can be transferred even for possibly non - smooth lipschitz extensions , allowing us to prove the main result of this note :    [ main ] if @xmath26 , then the pair @xmath27 does not have the lipschitz extension property .    since @xmath28 is isometrically",
    "embedded in @xmath0 for @xmath29 it is enough to prove the statement for @xmath30 .",
    "the idea of the proof is to exploit the consequences of the aforementioned contact condition . indeed",
    ", this condition implies that a globally defined smooth contact map @xmath31 is orientation preserving , which gives a major restriction on the nature of globally defined lipschitz mappings .",
    "it allows us to define a map @xmath32 from a subset @xmath33 into @xmath28 that does not have a globally defined lipschitz extension . in order to prove the non - existence of such an extension we use results from mapping degree theory @xcite , @xcite and pansu s result on almost everywhere differentiability @xcite",
    "this argument does not work for the case of the pairs @xmath34 as smooth contact maps @xmath35 are not necessarily orientation preserving .",
    "in this case the lipschitz extension property is still open .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we recall the metric structure of the heisenberg group and discuss regularity results of lipschitz maps between heisenberg groups to be used in the sequel . in section 3",
    "we prove a result on the computation of the mapping degree of maps between heisenberg groups using the pansu derivative .",
    "this result may be of independent interest .",
    "in section 4 we give the proof of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "the authors thank jeremy t.  tyson , stefan wenger , piotr hajlasz and enrico le donne for many stimulating conversations on the subject of the paper .",
    "we recall background results on the geometry of the heisenberg group and preliminary results on the differentiability properties of lipschitz maps between heisenberg groups .",
    "the model of the heisenberg group @xmath0 used in this paper is described as follows : @xmath36 , endowed with the group operation @xmath37 for @xmath38 . here ,",
    "@xmath39 stands for the usual scalar product of vectors @xmath40 .",
    "it is easy to check that the vector fields @xmath41 are left invariant for @xmath42 .",
    "for @xmath43 the space @xmath44 is the horizontal plane at @xmath45 .",
    "varying @xmath43 gives rise to a vector bundle @xmath46 , the horizontal plane distribution .",
    "let us choose the riemannian metric on @xmath46 which makes @xmath47 orthonormal at each point @xmath43 and denote the length of horizontal vectors @xmath48 in this metric by @xmath49 .",
    "a lipschitz curve @xmath50 \\to { { \\mathbb h}}^n$ ] is said to be horizontal if @xmath51 for a.e .",
    "@xmath52 $ ] . for @xmath53",
    "we denote by @xmath54 the sub - riemannian carnot - carathodory distance between @xmath45 and @xmath55 defined as @xmath56 where the @xmath57 is taken over all horizontal curves connecting @xmath45 and @xmath55 .",
    "such horizontal curves exist between any pair of points @xmath53 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the horizontal distribution is bracket - generating . for an explicit computation of the geodesics and the exact formulae of the metric we refer to  @xcite",
    "( see also  @xcite or  @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath58 is invariant under left translation .",
    "moreover , it is compatible with the homogeneous dilations @xmath59 defined by @xmath60 , i.e.  @xmath61 for all @xmath62 and @xmath53 .    in this paper the metric on @xmath0",
    "is understood to be the above defined carnot - carathodory metric @xmath58 .",
    "however the main result of the paper remains valid for any metric @xmath63 on @xmath0 that is bi - lipschitz equivalent to @xmath58 .",
    "it is easy to see that a smooth lipschitz map @xmath64 has the property that its tangent map preserves the horizontal bundle @xmath46 . since the horizontal bundle is the kernel of the one - form @xmath65 we obtain that there exists a real valued smooth function @xmath66 such that @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath68 is merely lipschitz with no additional smoothness assumptions , then @xmath66 is only an @xmath69 function and the equality @xmath67 holds almost everywhere .",
    "this follows from the following differentiability result :    a lipschitz map @xmath70 is called @xmath71-differentiable at a point @xmath72 if there exists a group homomorphism @xmath73 such that @xmath74 for all @xmath75 .",
    "here @xmath76 stands for the group operation , @xmath77 is the homogeneous group dilation , and @xmath78 is the inverse to @xmath45 in @xmath79 .",
    "pansu proved in @xcite that any lipschitz map is @xmath71-differentiable almost everywhere , moreover in a point of @xmath71-differentiability the limit is uniform in @xmath55 if @xmath55 is taking its values in a compact set .",
    "let us define the singular set of a lipschitz map @xmath80 as @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 and the regular set as @xmath84    for @xmath85 we denote by @xmath86 the @xmath63-dimensional hausdorff measure with respect to the heisenberg metric .",
    "by pansu s theorem we have @xmath87 , which implies by the lipschitz continuity of @xmath68 that also @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , we observe that if @xmath89 , the metric jacobian @xmath90 of @xmath68 at @xmath45 vanishes , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the ( open ) ball with center @xmath45 and radius @xmath93 in the heisenberg metric .",
    "for any measurable set @xmath94 we have @xmath95 ( see e.g.  chapter  6 of  @xcite ) , so @xmath96 and @xmath97",
    "in this section we will use the @xmath71-derivative in order to estimate the mapping degree of lipschitz maps between heisenberg groups . for background results on degree theory",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the considerations of this section are based on the fact that smooth contact maps @xmath98 have a positive jacobi determinant , and so they preserve orientation . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath99 be the contact form in @xmath28 .",
    "observe that if we denote by @xmath100 the volume form in @xmath28 , then there exists a dimensional constant @xmath101 such that @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath68 is a smooth contact mapping then @xmath103 for some real valued smooth function @xmath66 .",
    "the relation between the jacobi determinant of @xmath68 and @xmath66 can be computed as follows : @xmath104 which implies that @xmath105 . in particular",
    ", it follows that group homomorphisms @xmath106 are orientation preserving .",
    "we want to extend this observation from the class of smooth lipschitz maps to possibly non - smooth lipschitz mappings .",
    "this is possible by a version of the rademacher differentiability theorem due to pansu @xcite according to which lipschitz maps between carnot groups are differentiable almost everywhere ; and their tangent map satisfies the contact condition in the points of differentiability .",
    "note that differentiability is understood here in terms of the underlying group operation and compatible homogeneous dilations as indicated in the previous section .",
    "the classical rademacher differentiability theorem that is formulated in terms of vector addition and scalar multiplication as in the euclidean space fails for lipschitz maps between carnot groups .",
    "an example showing this fact is due to magnani @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , pansu s differentiability theorem can be used to estimate the mapping degree for maps between carnot groups .",
    "the main result of this section is the following statement :    [ degree ] let @xmath107 be an integer , @xmath98 a lipschitz map , @xmath108 an open set , and @xmath109 . if @xmath110 , then @xmath111    let us consider a ( possibly ) non - smooth lipschitz map @xmath98 as in the statement .",
    "there are two cases to consider : if @xmath112 , then @xmath113 by the definition of the degree ( @xcite , @xcite ) and we are done .",
    "let us therefore assume that @xmath114 $ ] . in this case we shall prove that @xmath115 the proof is based on the fact that for group homomorphisms this property holds true as indicated above .",
    "this fact will be combined with a localization argument using linearization by the @xmath71-differential of @xmath68 at regular points .",
    "the first step is to show that if @xmath114 $ ] , the pre - image @xmath116 is a finite set .    to prove this , assume by contradiction that there exists an infinite sequence @xmath117 of distinct points in @xmath118 such that @xmath119 for each @xmath120 . by passing to a subsequence",
    "we can assume that @xmath121 for some @xmath122 .",
    "by continuity of @xmath68 we obtain that @xmath123 .",
    "since @xmath124 , this implies that @xmath125 .",
    "we shall obtain the desired contradiction by showing that @xmath126 is non - injective .    to see this ,",
    "let us write @xmath127 for some @xmath128 and @xmath129 , @xmath130 . by passing to a further subsequence",
    "if necessary we can assume that @xmath131 for some @xmath132 . since @xmath133 , we have @xmath134 but this last limit equals @xmath135 by the lipschitz continuity of @xmath68 and the fact that @xmath131 .",
    "so @xmath136 , in contradiction to @xmath137 .",
    "by the first step we can assume that @xmath138 by general properties of the mapping degree ( @xcite , @xcite ) we have that @xmath139 where @xmath140 are arbitrary small , non - intersecting open sets containing @xmath141 for @xmath142 .    in the following we shall prove that @xmath143 for every @xmath144 .",
    "the idea is to construct a homotopy from @xmath68 to its linearization @xmath145 in @xmath146 with the property that the image of @xmath147 under the homotopy does not meet the point @xmath45 .",

    "the @xmath71-differentiability of @xmath68 at @xmath135 now reads as @xmath154 and the convergence is uniform in @xmath132 .",
    "equivalently , for every @xmath155 there exists an @xmath156 such that @xmath157 for all @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "furthermore , by the injectivity and homogeneity of @xmath160 there exists an @xmath161 such that @xmath162 for all @xmath132 and @xmath62 .",

    "observe that the statement of proposition [ degree ] no longer holds for maps @xmath177 . indeed",
    ", the mapping @xmath177 given by @xmath178 is a contact map since @xmath179 , and it is orientation reversing : @xmath180 . more generally , it is easy to see that every integer is the degree of some contact map between domains in @xmath181 .",

    "now a direct computation gives @xmath252 to calculate @xmath253 , all we need to do is to replace on the right side of   @xmath246 by @xmath247 and @xmath248 by @xmath249 . after doing that",
