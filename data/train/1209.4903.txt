    "the evolution of galaxies can not be understood without the simultaneous consideration of the surrounding gas .",
    "galaxies drive powerful , galactic - scale outflows , and must also accrete gas from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "thus the process of galaxy evolution reflects the cycling of baryons in and out of galaxies .",
    "the importance of galactic outflows is supported by a wide range of models and observations .",
    "an incomplete list of phenomena that may be explained by galactic outflows includes the shape of the mass - metallicity relation and the metal enrichment of the igm ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the quenching of star formation in massive galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and the mismatch between the galaxy luminosity function and the mass function of dark matter halos ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "powerful galactic outflows must also modulate the inflow of gas into galaxies , constraining the assembly of the baryonic component and regulating star formation ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in the broadest terms ,",
    "galactic outflows are powered by energy and momentum injected into the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies by star formation and/or active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "hot ( @xmath8 k ) , metal - enriched supernova ejecta may be expelled from galaxies , entraining significant amounts of the cool ( @xmath9 k ) ism in the process .",
    "even before massive stars explode as supernovae , radiation pressure may accelerate the cool gas to large velocities @xcite .",
    "the detailed physics of the outflows remains controversial , however , and observational constraints on the velocity of outflows as a function of radius , the mass outflow rate , the spatial extent of outflows , and the scaling of these quantities with galaxy mass and star formation rate are needed .",
    "galactic winds are most commonly traced via the blueshifts of interstellar absorption lines from cool , outflowing gas , seen against the backlight of the stellar continuum . in the local universe",
    ", outflows are found in starburst galaxies , from dwarf starbursts to ulirgs ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "both observations and models suggest a critical star formation rate density in order to drive outflows @xcite , and outflow velocity is observed to increase with galaxy mass and star formation rate @xcite .    at higher redshifts , @xmath10 , outflows are ubiquitous , with most galaxies observed showing absorption lines blueshifted by @xmath11 - 300 km  s@xmath2  ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "outflows in high redshift galaxies are also traced by @xmath12 , which is seen in redshifted emission as well as blueshifted absorption ; the emission is interpreted as resonant scattering of @xmath12  photons from receding gas on the far side of the galaxy . because the high redshift studies have been restricted to a smaller range in mass and star formation rate than the local samples ( which extend to low mass dwarfs ) , trends between outflow properties and galaxy properties have been more difficult to determine",
    "; however , recent results at @xmath13 suggest similar scalings with galaxy mass and sfr @xcite .",
    "a major difficulty in the study of outflows is the measurement of their spatial extent , since absorption line studies of galaxies offer no information on the location of the absorbing gas .",
    "spatial information can be obtained by measuring absorption in the spectra of background objects ( qsos or galaxies ) with lines of sight passing near galaxies .",
    "@xcite used composite spectra of pairs of foreground and background galaxies , stacked as a function of impact parameter , to show that significant metal line absorption is seen around galaxies to distances of @xmath14 kpc , while @xmath12  absorption extends to @xmath15 kpc .",
    "searches for star - forming counterparts to  absorption systems also suggest that galaxies drive outflows to large distances @xcite , while the observation that strong  absorption systems are preferentially found along the minor axis of disk galaxies is further evidence that these systems are associated with outflows @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , not all absorption systems have detectable counterparts @xcite and the absorption has also been interpreted as being due to infalling gas @xcite , a scenario potentially supported by the fact that an increase in  absorption is also seen along the major axes of disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "the extent of outflowing gas can also be measured if galactic winds can be observed in emission .",
    "extended @xmath16  and x - ray emission is observed in local starbursts @xcite , but such emission becomes undetectable at higher redshifts . at @xmath17 , @xcite",

    "both the  and the @xmath12  photons are interpreted as arising from resonant scattering in outflowing gas .    in this study",
    "we focus on  and  absorption and emission in galaxies at @xmath20 .",
    "the  @xmath5 2796 , 2803 doublet is a particularly useful diagnostic because it can be observed from the ground over a wide range in redshift , from @xmath21 to @xmath4 , thus in principle offering direct comparisons of outflow properties over @xmath22 gyr of cosmic time . in practice ,",
    "samples across this redshift range have so far differed significantly in size , selection technique , and type of galaxy observed @xcite .",
    "the study of  and  absorption and emission has also benefited from recent radiative transfer modeling of these transitions .",
    "@xcite use a variety of different galactic outflow models to predict the strengths of these lines , emphasizing the importance of photon scattering and the effect of re - emitted photons on the line profiles .",
    "photons absorbed in resonance lines such as  are re - emitted near the systemic velocity , creating underlying emission which fills in the absorption and may affect inferences about the velocity and covering fraction of outflowing gas . because most of the  resonance lines are coupled to fine structure transitions , as shown in the energy level diagram in figure [ fig : energylevels ] , the photons absorbed in the  transitions may instead be re - emitted in the * fine structure lines .",
    "this paper focuses on the effect of photon scattering on measurements of absorption line velocity centroids and equivalent widths , and on * and  emission and absorption as tracers of outflowing gas .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our sample and the acquisition and analysis of the data in section [ sec : obs ] , the determination of systemic redshifts in section [ sec : zsys ] , and the determination of stellar population properties in section [ sec : sedfitting ] .",

    "we observed one mask in each of the three fields , covering a total of 147 galaxies .",
    "galaxies were selected for the masks based on the following priorities : 1 ) known redshift ( from the previous far - uv spectroscopy of @xcite ) in the range @xmath39 ; 2 ) the bm ( as opposed to bx ) color criteria , which target the redshift range for which features of interest fall within the spectral co verage ; and 3 ) brighter galaxies with @xmath40 . we used the 600 l / mm grating , which gives a dispersion of 0.65  / pixel .",
    "exposure times ranged from 7.5 to 11 hrs , with average seeing fwhm  @xmath41 .",
    "details of the observations are given in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "most of the data reduction was done with the deep2 data processing pipeline @xcite , which produces one - dimensional air wavelength - calibrated galaxy , inverse variance and sky spectra .",
    "we then removed the instrumental signature from the data by putting the galaxy and error spectra on a relative flux scale with the iraf software package , using standard stars observed in the same manner as the galaxies .",
    "we also removed the strong telluric absorption bands due to molecular oxygen at @xmath42  and @xmath43 .",
    "this correction is usually done by scaling the strength of the telluric absorption seen in a standard star spectrum to the absorption strength seen in an object s spectrum .",
    "because of the long integration times used in this study , however , the galaxies were observed over a range of airmasses , making a single standard star observation taken at a single air mass a poor match to the telluric feature strength in the individual galaxy spectra .",
    "a better measurement of the shape of the telluric features can be obtained from an average observed - frame galaxy spectrum for each field ( because the galaxies lie at different redshifts , combining in the observed frame averages over the galaxy properties but gives a good measurement of the sky features ) .",
    "we used these average spectra to create telluric feature templates for each field .",
    "each average galaxy spectrum was normalized and smoothed , and then portions of the spectrum which were outside of the telluric bands were forced to have a normalized flux value of one , leaving the telluric bands as the only deviations from continuum .",
    "the resulting spectrum served as the template telluric spectrum for each field .",
    "this template was then divided into each of the galaxy and error spectra .",
    "finally , the individual spectra were converted to a vacuum wavelength scale and rebinned by a factor of two to increase s / n ;",
    "the 600 l / mm grating is deimos lowest resolution mode and so results in oversampled data .",
    "the final pixel scale is 1.25   per pixel in the observed frame , and the spectral resolution ( measured from the widths of the night sky lines at @xmath43  ) is @xmath44   ( fwhm ) or @xmath45 km  s@xmath2  in the q1623 field , which was observed with 1  slits , and @xmath46   or @xmath47 km  s@xmath2  in the q1700 and q2343 fields , which were observed with 1.2  slits .",
    "we measured redshifts @xmath48 for 96 of the 147 galaxies observed , either from [ ] @xmath53727 , 3729 emission or  and  absorption as discussed in section [ sec : zsys ] below ( the remaining 51 galaxies were mostly among the fainter objects on the masks , and most had spectra too noisy to enable redshift determination ; 4 galaxies had @xmath49 ) . the analysis presented here is based on this sample of 96 galaxies .    after measuring redshifts ,",
    "the 96 spectra were normalized using the procedure outlined by @xcite .",
    "normalization was done only in the rest - frame wavelength range 22003000  ; this range contains the  and  features of interest , and increasing sky noise at redder wavelengths makes normalization more difficult .",
    "we shifted the spectra into the rest frame , identified regions of the spectrum which contained flux solely from the continuum , and fit a spline curve to both the mean wavelength and mean flux values within these defined continuum windows .",
    "the same windows were used for each galaxy , with adjustment on an individual basis to avoid the gap between detectors or noise spikes . each galaxy spectrum",
    "was then divided by the spline fit to its continuum .",
    "the uncertainty in the continuum fits is @xmath50 for most galaxies .",
    "these continuum normalized spectra were used for the remainder of the analysis .",
    "we also make use of multi - wavelength imaging in order to model the spectral energy distributions of the galaxies .",

    "the systemic redshift of a galaxy ( i.e. , the redshift of its stars ) serves as the velocity zero - point for studying the kinematics of galactic and circumgalactic gas , and is used to align galaxies in the rest - frame for the construction of composite spectra , as described in section [ sec : composites ] . a reliable determination of the systemic redshift is therefore required for this study .",
    "the preferred method of redshift determination , measurement of the wavelengths of strong nebular emission lines from  regions , becomes increasingly difficult for galaxies with @xmath56 , as these lines redshift into the near - ir .",
    "the centers of stellar photospheric absorption lines can also be used , but while these features are located at accessible wavelengths , they are broad and shallow and therefore hard to identify at the s / n of most high redshift galaxy spectra . if none of these features are available , the systemic redshift can be estimated from the wavelengths of the interstellar absorption lines .",
    "in this study we use the first and third of the above methods . for 51 of the 96 galaxies in the sample , strong [ ]  @xmath53727 , 3729 emission is included at the red end of the spectral region covered , allowing a precise determination of the systemic redshift from a double gaussian fit to the [ ]  doublet , which is usually resolved .",
    "these 51 galaxies have a mean redshift @xmath57 .    for the remaining 45 galaxies in the sample ,",
    "we turn to the interstellar absorption lines .",
    "it is well - documented that these features are blueshifted with respect to the systemic redshift and that , while the degree of blueshifting varies for individual galaxies , the assumption of an average velocity offset between the systemic and interstellar absorption redshifts allows the construction of composite spectra which are effectively at zero velocity @xcite .",
    "we follow the method of @xcite , who use a sample of star - forming galaxies at @xmath58 with both interstellar absorption lines and systemic redshifts from @xmath16  emission to find that , on average , the interstellar absorption lines are offset from the systemic redshift by @xmath59 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we use the subsample of galaxies with measurements of both [ ]  emission and  @xmath602374 absorption to derive the average offset between nebular emission and interstellar absorption for our sample ( as discussed in sections [ sec : individual ] and [ sec : composites ] , this  transition is expected to be least affected by the presence of emission , and therefore most representative of the kinematics of the outflow ) .",
    "as described in more detail in section [ sec : individual ] , absorption line centroids are measured from a single gaussian fit using the idl routine _ mpfit.pro_ , which measures the center and equivalent width of each feature and their associated uncertainties . because [ ]  and this  transition are at opposite ends of the accessible wavelength range , there are 20 galaxies whose spectra include significant detections of both features ; the average uncertainty in the  velocity measurements of this sample is 41 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the relationship between the [ ] -defined systemic redshift and the redshift of the interstellar absorption is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 km  s@xmath2  is the average velocity offset ( we compute an unweighted mean to avoid the possibility of biasing the result toward brighter galaxies , which may also be more massive )",
    ". the standard deviation is 87 km  s@xmath2 , reflecting the significant scatter among individual measurements , while the error in the mean is 10 km  s@xmath2 .    for the higher s",
    "/ n spectra with systemic redshifts from [ ]  emission , we also measure velocity offsets through a joint fit to the  @xmath602344 , 2374 and 2587 lines ( for more details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the mean absorption line velocity measured in this way is @xmath63",
    "km  s@xmath2  with a standard deviation of 80 km  s@xmath2 , in good agreement with the value of @xmath64 km  s@xmath2  measured from  @xmath602374 alone ; the joint and  @xmath602374 velocities agree within 2@xmath6 in all cases , and within 1@xmath6 in half of the measured sample .",
    "the magnitude of the velocity offset @xmath65 is a factor of @xmath66 smaller than the value of @xmath59 km  s@xmath2  ( mean and standard deviation ) determined by @xcite .",
    "we plot @xmath65 against redshift for the current sample and for the higher redshift sample of @xcite in figure [ fig : deltav_z ] ( see also figure 2 of @xcite ) , clearly showing the smaller offset from systemic velocity in the lower redshift sample .",
    "the horizontal dotted line divides the @xcite sample into two redshift bins containing an equal number of galaxies , and the large light blue points show the mean velocity offset and redshift of each bin ; although the scatter is considerable , the average offset from systemic increases with increasing redshift , from @xmath67 km  s@xmath2  at @xmath68 to @xmath69 km  s@xmath2  at @xmath70 .",
    "this increase is apparently driven by a decreasing fraction of objects with velocities near zero , as well as a higher fraction with @xmath71 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "our lower redshift sample follows the same trend of decreasing velocity centroid with decreasing redshift .",
    "a full explanation of this trend requires more careful accounting of selection effects , however ; our galaxies are on average somewhat lower in mass than the @xcite sample , since the magnitude limit of the survey reaches intrinsically fainter objects at lower redshifts .",
    "velocity offsets in the @xcite sample are measured from the far - uv interstellar absorption lines  @xmath72 , @xmath73 and  @xmath74 , whereas we use the near - uv  lines .",
    "the kinematics of these different lines have not been directly compared , although ,  and  are expected to be similar as all of these transitions arise in cool outflowing gas , and @xcite find the kinematics of to be similar to those of the low ionization lines .",
    "finally , a decrease in the blueshift of the velocity centroid does not necessarily correspond to a decrease in the outflow velocity , since the centroid may be influenced by the interstellar medium of the galaxy or by underlying emission near zero velocity .",
    "for the 45 galaxies in the sample without [ ]  emission , we use equation [ eq : zsys ] to determine the systemic redshift . where possible , we use  @xmath602374 to define the absorption redshift , and when that feature is unavailable , we use  @xmath602587 ( the choice of these two lines",
    "is motivated by the fact that they are least likely to be affected by emission filling , which may shift the wavelength to the blue ) . in the 14 galaxies where these two features were not detected",
    ", we use the far - uv absorption redshift from prior keck / lris spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the mean systemic redshift of the sample of 45 galaxies determined in this way is then @xmath75 .",
    "given the possible trend of @xmath65 with redshift , there is some concern that the galaxies for which we apply equation [ eq : zsys ] lie at somewhat higher redshifts than the galaxies used to determine the equation ; however , the similar velocity offsets of our sample and the lower redshift half of the @xcite sample suggest that this is not a large effect .    it is desirable to verify systemic redshifts obtained in this way via measurement of weak stellar or nebular features in composite spectra ; if systemic redshifts have been assigned correctly , these features should lie at zero velocity ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately our spectra do not contain features ideal for this purpose .",
    "the strongest nebular emission line , ]  @xmath76 , is a blend of several closely separated transitions whose ratios depend on the electron density , making it unsuitable for precise redshift determinations .",
    "the composite spectrum of all 96 galaxies does contain a weak detection of the @xmath77 stellar photospheric line ( vacuum rest wavelength 2297.579  ) , used by @xcite to measure the systemic redshift of the lensed galaxy ms 1512-cb58 .",
    "the low s / n of this line makes it of limited use , but its velocity in the composite spectrum is @xmath78 km  s@xmath2 , consistent with zero .",
    "we can also check the systemic redshifts by comparing the composite spectrum of the 51 galaxies with [ ] -based redshifts with that of the 45 galaxies with redshifts determined using equation [ eq : zsys ] .",
    "for this test we compare the centroid and width of * @xmath79 , the strongest emission line appearing in both spectra ; we find that the line centroids in the two spectra agree to within 20 km  s@xmath2 , while the line is @xmath80   ( 90 km  s@xmath2 ) broader in the spectrum constructed using redshifts from equation [ eq : zsys ] .",
    "such broadening is expected given the 87 km  s@xmath2  dispersion in @xmath65 .",
    "these tests validate our use of equation [ eq : zsys ] to determine the systemic redshifts of galaxies without [ ]  emission .",
    "for 71 of the 96 galaxies in the sample , we determine the stellar mass , age , extinction and star formation rate through modeling of the broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "we require photometry in the @xmath55 and/or _ spitzer _ irac 3.6 or 4.5  bands in order to perform the modeling , and most of the remaining 25 galaxies are not covered by this ir imaging ; we do not expect these 25 galaxies to be significantly different from the rest of the sample .",
    "we model the sed as described by @xcite and @xcite ; briefly , we use the @xcite stellar population models , and assume constant star formation , the @xcite extinction law , and a @xcite initial mass function .",
    "uncertainties in the fitted parameters are determined by monte carlo simulations which perturb the input photometry according to the photometric uncertainties and determine the best - fit sed for the perturbed colors ; typical fractional uncertainties are @xmath81 , 0.4 , 0.5 , and 0.2 in @xmath82 , age , sfr , and stellar mass , respectively .",
    "systematic uncertainties are discussed further in section [ sec : compspecs ] .",
    "we assume constant star formation histories because of the difficulty of obtaining robust constraints on the star formation history of galaxies from sed fitting alone ; fortunately , the stellar mass is relatively insensitive to the assumed star formation history @xcite .",
    "the range of stellar population parameters for the 71 galaxies is shown in figure [ fig : sedhists ] .",
    "we find a mean ( median ) stellar mass @xmath83 @xmath84(@xmath85 @xmath84 ) , mean ( median ) reddening @xmath86 ( 0.21 ) , mean ( median ) age 550 myr ( 360 myr ) , and mean ( median ) sfr 54 @xmath87  ( 22 @xmath87 ) . the degeneracies between age , extinction and star formation history involved in such modeling are well - known , as is the fact that the stellar mass is the most well - determined parameter ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss the relationships between the modeled quantities further in section [ sec : composites ] , where we construct composite spectra based on stellar population properties .",
    "representative examples of the individual spectra are shown in figures [ fig : ind_fespecs ] and [ fig : mg2profiles ] .",
    "figure [ fig : ind_fespecs ] shows the two complexes of  absorption and emission lines , at @xmath88 and @xmath89  ; the top two spectra are among the highest s / n in the sample , while the spectrum of q2343-bx410 in the bottom panel is more representative of the typical data quality .",
    "we also show the  @xmath52796 , 2803 profiles for these four galaxies and four additional objects in figure [ fig : mg2profiles ] . while the  absorption lines show some variation in their strengths , we see much greater diversity in the  profiles , which range from strong emission with very little absorption ( q2343-bx256 ) to pure absorption ( q2343-bx410 ) ; the pattern is suggestive of that seen in the far - uv spectra of high redshift galaxies , in which @xmath12  may appear in emission or absorption while the interstellar resonance lines appear in absorption .",
    "we study the relationships between the strengths of these lines and the properties of the galaxies in this section and in the section following .",
    "the features covered by the spectra are listed in table [ tab : lines ] .",
    "many of these , particularly the weaker emission lines , are significantly detected only in the composite spectra discussed in the next section .",
    "we measure the absorption and emission features by fitting a single gaussian profile to each line using the idl routine _ mpfit.pro_ ; given a spectrum and the error spectrum containing the pixel - to - pixel uncertainties , this routine measures the center and equivalent width of each line and their associated uncertainties .",
    "although absorption lines associated with galactic outflows generally show asymmetric profiles",

    "histograms of these two subsamples are shown in the inset at the upper right of figure [ fig : beta_mg2 ] . repeating the k - s",
    "test indicates that the probability that the two samples are drawn from the same distribution is 0.0097 .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath106 distributions , the emitting and non - emitting samples are similarly distributed in uv luminosity .",
    "emission was also identified in a sample of @xmath121 @xmath13 galaxies by @xcite , using criteria which select an excess of emission above the continuum level in a window between the two  absorption lines .",
    "the excess emission objects selected in this way constituted @xmath122% of the sample , and were attributed to narrow - line agn .",
    "@xcite found that these excess emission objects had bluer @xmath123 colors and ( in contrast to our results ) were more luminous .",
    "they also found that the excess emission was usually at the systemic redshift and not always accompanied by absorption .",
    "our fraction of  emitters is considerably higher than that of @xcite , although the different selection criteria make a direct comparison difficult .",
    "we attribute the emission to resonant scattering in outflowing gas ; as shown in figure [ fig : mg2profiles ] , the emission is generally redshifted and accompanied by blueshifted absorption , the classic p cygni profile of an outflow .",
    "the p cyngi profile is also seen in @xmath12  emission and absorption in galaxies at high redshift , and the relationship between uv color and @xmath12  emission is similar to the relationship between uv color and  emission : galaxies with stronger @xmath12  emission are observed to have bluer uv slopes @xcite .",
    "we discuss the relationship between  emission and galaxy properties further in section [ sec : composites ] .      as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , most of the  absorption lines are coupled to fine structure transitions , such that a photon absorbed at ( for example ) 2587   can be emitted in the * @xmath602612 or @xmath602632 emission lines .",
    "the exception is  @xmath124 ; the only allowed transition for a photon absorbed in this line is a return to the ground state .",
    "thus , as discussed in detail by @xcite , one may expect significant rescattered emission to  fill in \" the absorption in this and other resonant transitions ; one may also expect the filling to be greater when the photon has no other means to return to a lower energy level , i.e.  for transitions such as  @xmath124 which are not coupled to fine structure emission lines .",
    "evidence for this emission filling may be seen in the form of blueshifted velocity centroids , since the scattered emission is expected to occur near systemic velocity , or in a decrease in absorption equivalent width .",
    "either of these effects may influence conclusions drawn regarding the kinematics , optical depth and covering fraction of outflowing gas .",
    "the remainder of this section is dedicated to assessing the effect of this emission filling on measurements of velocity centroids and equivalent widths .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ind_velcomp ] we compare the velocities with respect to systemic for various transitions , as measured by the center of the gaussian fit .",
    "we plot only galaxies with velocity uncertainties @xmath125 km  s@xmath2  ( an absolute uncertainty is preferable to some threshold in @xmath126 in order to avoid biasing the sample away from galaxies with @xmath127 near zero ) .",
    "because this measurement relies on a precise determination of the systemic redshift for each object , we include only galaxies for which we have determined @xmath128 from [ ]  emission .",
    "we plot the velocity centroids of  @xmath124 and  @xmath129 absorption ,  @xmath602796 absorption , and * @xmath130 emission , all against that of  @xmath131 .",
    "as discussed above , we may expect  @xmath124 to show a larger blueshift than  @xmath131 or  @xmath129 , and this is indeed observed in the upper two panels of figure [ fig : ind_velcomp ] : on average ,  @xmath131 and  @xmath129 show identical blueshifts of @xmath132 km  s@xmath2 , while the average relative shifts of  @xmath131 and  @xmath124 are @xmath133 and @xmath134 km  s@xmath2  respectively ( the two averages for  @xmath131 are not identical because we include only galaxies with @xmath125 km  s@xmath2  for both lines in each plot , and the two subsamples are slightly different ) .",
    "we also compare the relative velocity shifts of  @xmath131 and  @xmath602796 , in the lower left panel of figure [ fig : ind_velcomp ] .",
    "because both  @xmath124 and  @xmath602796 are resonance transitions coupled only to the ground state , we might expect emission filling to affect them similarly ; however , as also suggested by the diversity of  profiles relative to  in figures [ fig : ind_fespecs ] and [ fig : mg2profiles ] , the  transition shows stronger evidence for the presence of emission .",

    "finally , we compare the velocity centroids of  @xmath131 with those of the strongest  fine structure emission line , * @xmath130 .",
    "we discuss the origin of the fine structure emission lines in more detail in the following sections ; for now , we note that @xcite have proposed that * emission arises from photon scattering in the outflowing gas and should be observed at or near systemic velocity , assuming that the outflow is approximately isotropic and has little extinction . with a mean velocity centroid of @xmath138 km  s@xmath2 ,",
    "our observations are in general agreement with this scenario .",
    "we turn next to a comparison of the equivalent widths of the  absorption lines , measured by integrating the best - fit gaussian profiles . for an optically thin transition ,",
    "the equivalent width @xmath139 of an absorption line depends on the covering fraction and column density @xmath140 of the ion and the oscillator strength of the transition @xmath141 such that @xmath142 .",
    "when the transition becomes optically thick , the equivalent width depends instead on the velocity dispersion and covering fraction of the absorbing gas , and we then expect ( in the absence of emission filling ) different transitions of the same ion to have the same equivalent width .",
    "it is therefore instructive to compare the equivalent widths of some of the observed  absorption lines .    in figure",

    "respectively , these two lines should have very different equivalent widths in the optically thin case , with @xmath145 . as the absorbing gas becomes optically thick",
    ", we expect @xmath146 .",
    "an additional effect is the possible presence of emission filling : as discussed above , the two transitions differ in that  @xmath131 is coupled to a fine structure transition , while  @xmath124 is not , and we therefore expect that  @xmath124 is more likely to be affected by the presence of emission underlying the absorption line",
    ". such underlying emission would lead to a decrease in equivalent width , producing , in the optically thick case , otherwise unphysical line ratios of @xmath147 .",
    "figure [ fig : ind_ewcomp ] shows that in most cases @xmath148 is consistent with unity or falls between the saturated and unsaturated limits . however , there are four objects ( q1623-bm95 , q1700-bm154 , q1700-bx1043 and q2343-bx364 , shown with large red circles in figure [ fig : ind_ewcomp ] ) for which the equivalent width ratio of the two lines can only be explained by a decreased  @xmath124 equivalent width due to underlying emission . note that this represents only a lower limit on the number of objects affected by emission filling ; if the intrinsic line ratio falls between the unsaturated and saturated limits , as is the case for many of the galaxies in the sample , the equivalent width comparison can not distinguish between emission filling and an increase in optical depth .",
    "there are also several additional objects that fall in the unshaded region with lower significance , so there may be additional galaxies in the sample with @xmath147 .    as shown in figure [ fig : mg2profiles ]",
    ", q1623-bm95 and q1700-bm154 also have strong  emission ; q1700-bx1043 and q2343-bx364 ( not shown in figure [ fig : mg2profiles ] ) have lower s / n in the  region , making the presence of emission more difficult to assess , but using the criterion described in section [ sec : mg2uvcolor ] bx1043 is also an  emitter while bx364 is not .",
    "we also note that the stellar masses of q1623-bm95 , q1700-bm154 , q1700-bx1043 and q2343-bx364 are @xmath149 @xmath84 , @xmath150 @xmath84 , @xmath151 @xmath84  and @xmath152 @xmath84  respectively , all lower than the average stellar mass of @xmath153 @xmath84 .",

    "in order to examine weak emission and absorption lines and study the variation of spectral features with galaxy properties more closely , we construct composite spectra based on the modeled stellar population properties and on the presence or absence of  emission .",
    "we also create a composite spectrum of all 96 galaxies in the sample .",

    "the spectrum was produced by the stellar synthesis code starburst99 @xcite , and incorporates the library of theoretical uv spectra of massive stars described by @xcite .",

    "we divide the 71 galaxies into three bins based on each of these four parameters and construct composite spectra of the galaxies in the highest and lowest bins , resulting in 8 composite spectra , each constructed from 24 individual spectra .",

    "the result is that @xmath82 and the sfr may be overestimated for the youngest galaxies in the sample ( and because of the covariance between extinction and age in the modeling , the ages of these objects are also uncertain ) .",
    "this systematic uncertainty primarily affects galaxies with best - fit ages ( calculated with models assuming the calzetti extinction law ) less than 50 myr , of which there are 16 in our sample of 71 objects with sed fits .",
    "@xcite find that restricting the ages to be at least 50 myr ( approximately equal to the dynamical time ) and using the smc extinction law for such objects brings the sed - determined sfrs into agreement with sfrs determined from the combined unobscured uv + ir luminosities .",

    "we have also constructed composite spectra of the 33 galaxies with and 63 galaxies without  emission , determined as described in section [ sec : mg2uvcolor ] .",
    "table [ tab : sedcomps ] does not report mean stellar population properties for these composites , since not all of the galaxies have photometry sufficient for sed modeling ; however , the composites with and without  emission have mean s / n per pixel of 16 .",

    "equivalent widths and velocity centroids are measured by direct integration of the flux above or below the continuum level , with @xmath158 uncertainties determined by monte carlo simulations in which we perturb each pixel of the original composite spectrum by an amount dependent on its uncertainty 5000 times to create 5000 artificial spectra .",
    "the resulting velocity measurements are flux - weighted centroids , measured over a typical range of @xmath159 km  s@xmath2   for the absorption lines and @xmath160 km  s@xmath2  for the emission lines .",
    "the uncertainties adopted for @xmath161  and velocity are the standard deviation of the 5000 measurements of these values made for each feature .",
    "measurements of the equivalent widths and velocity centroids of the absorption features are given in table [ tab : abs ] , and of the emission features in table [ tab : em ] .",
    "although we measured an average velocity shift of @xmath64 km  s@xmath2  relative to systemic for the  @xmath131 absorption line and then applied this shift to galaxies without [ ]  detections in order to construct the composites , the velocity centroid of feii  @xmath131 in the composite spectrum of all galaxies is @xmath162 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this difference is due to the asymmetric absorption line profiles of the higher s / n composite , in which an extended blue tail of absorption shifts the centroids to larger velocities when they are measured with direct integration rather than gaussian fits which assume symmetry .",
    "the peak optical depth of the line is consistent with the @xmath64 km  s@xmath2  measurements from individual spectra .",
    "the most striking feature of the composite spectra shown in figure [ fig : allcomposites ] is the difference in  profile , particularly for the high and low mass composites .",
    "the lowest mass galaxies have strong  emission and weak absorption , while the most massive galaxies have stronger absorption and no apparent emission .",
    "galaxies with young ages , low dust content , and ( marginally ) lower sfrs also show stronger  emission , although the differences are not as striking as in the composites based on stellar mass .",
    "similar trends were seen by @xcite , who saw increased  emission in composite spectra of lower mass galaxies and galaxies with lower sfrs ( although @xcite removed objects with excess  emission from their sample , additional emission became apparent when the symmetric , zero - velocity absorption component was removed from the  profile ; we do not attempt such decomposition here ) .",
    "the composite spectra also show more subtle differences in the strengths of the other absorption and emission features .",
    "we discuss these differences below .",
    "an inspection of the absorption line measurements in table [ tab : abs ] shows that the most consistent differences between the composite spectra arise when galaxies are divided based on stellar mass .",
    "all of the lines are blueshifted to larger velocities in the high mass spectrum relative to the low mass , and most of the lines have higher equivalent widths in the high mass galaxies as well .",
    "this larger blueshift suggests that more massive galaxies drive faster outflows , although we caution that the velocity centroid of the line is a poor proxy for outflow velocity because it may be influenced by absorption from the interstellar medium of the galaxy or by underlying emission .",
    "we discuss the question of outflow velocity in more detail in section [ sec : maxvels ] .      in figure",
    "[ fig : compvels ] we compare the velocity centroids of several of the lines in the various composite spectra .",
    "this figure should be compared with figure [ fig : ind_velcomp ] , in which we made the same comparisons for the individual spectra and found some evidence for the presence of underlying emission ( in @xmath136 of the sample ) in the form of blueshifted  @xmath124 velocities relative to  @xmath131 and  @xmath129 ; recall that the latter two lines are coupled to fine structure transitions and therefore may be less affected by emission filling .",
    "this signature blueshift of emission filling is less apparent in the composites .",
    "we see generally good agreement between all three of the  absorption lines , though the scatter is significant , particularly in the comparison of feii  @xmath131 and feii  @xmath129 .",
    "we conclude that although underlying emission may affect the velocity centroids of some  lines in some galaxies , the effect is not strong enough to be robustly detected in composite spectra .",
    "this may be because the fraction of galaxies so affected is relatively small , or because the higher s / n of the composites in combination with the method of direct integration makes the measurements of the composites more sensitive to absorption at a wider range of velocities , thereby decreasing the effect of underlying emission near zero .",
    "measurements of the individual spectra showed that the velocity centroid of  @xmath163 is more affected by underlying emission than any of the  lines , and this is also true of the composites .",
    "in contrast to the  lines studied ,  is blueshifted with respect to  @xmath131 in all of the composite spectra .",
    "this shift is probably due to underlying emission .",
    "the largest velocity difference is observed in the composites of galaxies with and without  emission : the average blueshift of  @xmath163 in galaxies with no detectable  emission is @xmath164 km  s@xmath2 , while the average shift of those with emission is @xmath165 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we observed above that low mass galaxies show stronger  emission , and that the emission is somewhat stronger in galaxies with young ages , low dust content , and lower sfrs ( all shown in blue in figure [ fig : compvels ] ) as well .",
    "figure [ fig : compvels ] suggests that this increased emission in low mass galaxies is apparent in the velocity of  absorption as well , since the blue points tend to be more displaced than the red points from the line of equal velocities .",
    "finally , we compare the velocity centroid of the * @xmath130 emission line with that of  @xmath131 in the composites ( we note that the velocity of the * @xmath130 line is not affected by the nearby * @xmath166 line because the two lines are well - separated , as can be seen from figure [ fig : allcomposites ] ) . the individual spectra showed that the velocity of * @xmath130 scattered around zero , with a marginal tendency for greater blueshifts ; in the composities we see consistently blueshifted velocity centroids of about @xmath167 km  s@xmath2 . as an additional check on this line , we measure the velocity offset of * @xmath130 in the composite spectrum of the 51 galaxies with [ ]  redshifts and find it to be consistent with the other composites at @xmath168 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the difference between the individual spectra and the composites may again be due to greater sensitivity to weak blueshifted emission in the composites ; see the discussion of the fine structure emission lines in section [ sec : emission ] below . in any case",
    ", as with the individual spectra , * @xmath130 is on average observed at velocities closer to systemic than any of the  absorption lines .",
    "next we compare the equivalent widths of the  @xmath131 and  @xmath124 absorption lines in the composites , as we did for the individual spectra in section [ sec : velw_indspec ] and figure [ fig : ind_ewcomp ] . in the case of the individual spectra",
    ", we saw that , with the exception of four low - mass galaxies , all of the objects in the sample have an equivalent width ratio consistent with the range expected based on the variation of optical depth , @xmath169 .",
    "the ratio of equivalent width for all of the composites falls within this range as well , as shown in figure [ fig : comp_ew ] .",
    "we do see systematic differences in the equivalent width ratio , however : low mass , young , and unreddened galaxies with low sfrs ( blue points ) have @xmath146 , while older , dustier , more massive galaxies with higher sfrs ( red points ) have @xmath170 .",
    "these systematic differences may represent real differences in optical depth between the two samples , although it may perhaps be surprising that the lower mass and less reddened samples would show higher optical depth than the dustier and more massive galaxies .",
    "the alternative explanation is that underlying emission is more likely to decrease the equivalent width of  @xmath124 relative to  @xmath131 in the low mass sample .",
    "this second explanation is supported by the four low mass galaxies whose individual spectra require the presence of such underlying emission ( see figure [ fig : ind_ewcomp ] ) , and perhaps by the fact that  emission is clearly stronger in low - mass galaxies .",
    "however , such underlying emission must have relatively little effect on the velocity centroids of the lines , since systematic differences between the red and blue points are less apparent in the velocity comparison of feii  @xmath131 and  @xmath124 shown in figure [ fig : compvels ] than in the equivalent width comparison in figure [ fig : comp_ew ] .",
    "we next examine the maximum blueshifted velocities of the absorption lines in composite spectra , a measurement we could not make for the individual objects due to limited s / n .",
    "high resolution , high s / n spectra of lensed galaxies show that the outflow - related interstellar absorption lines extend to typical velocities of @xmath171 to @xmath172 km  s@xmath2  @xcite , and similar maximum velocities are seen in composite spectra of galaxies at @xmath4  @xcite . @xcite",

    "we note , however , that the @xcite sample does not span a broad range in sfr ; their low sfr bin contains galaxies with @xmath194 @xmath87 , while their high sfr bins consists of galaxies with @xmath195 @xmath87 .    turning to our observed mass dependence",
    ", we find that it is entirely consistent with the results of @xcite , however ; for the mean stellar masses of the upper and lower mass bins , a dependence of @xmath196 would result in the massive galaxies having a maximum velocity 1.5 times larger than the low mass galaxies , exactly the difference between our two measured values .",
    "given the uncertainties in our measurements of @xmath176 , however , a variety of mass dependencies would be consistent with our observations .",
    "the remainder of this paper is devoted to the emission features in the composite spectra . as listed in table [ tab : lines ] and shown in figures [ fig : all_fullspec ] and [ fig : allcomposites ] , we detect emission from five * fine structure lines , and see significant emission in the  @xmath5 2796 , 2803 doublet for about @xmath197 of the galaxies in the sample .",

    "* emission is generally not seen in local star - forming and starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "these lines have also not been seen in samples of galaxies at redshifts similar to the current sample , due to spectral coverage in the case of @xcite and probably due to s / n limitations in the sample of @xcite .",
    "the situation is similar to that of the * fine structure lines in the far - uv , which are seen in galaxies at @xmath44 @xcite but not in local starbursts @xcite .",
    "@xcite detect both * and  emission in a starburst galaxy at @xmath17 , and propose that both are generated by photon scattering in outflowing gas .",

    "this model may explain the absence of fine structure emission in local galaxies , if the slits used to observe such objects cover only the central regions of the galaxies and capture little emission from an extended outflow @xcite .",

    "the * @xmath130 profile also indicates the presence of dust ; since the * lines are optically thin ( we see no absorption at their wavelengths ) , * emission should reach us from both sides of the outflow , rather than only the near side seen in absorption .",
    "the fact that we see more emission from the blueshifted side than the redshifted side is probably due to extinction , as photons from the far side of the galaxy must pass through more dust in order to reach us @xcite . as a test of this scenario",

    "we use photoionization models to study the origins of * and  emission . while previous work @xcite and the kinematics of the * @xmath130 line suggest that * fine structure emission arises in the outflow , other sources are also possible . in order to assess the possibility that the * emission originates in  regions , we have constructed a suite of photoionization models which we use to examine the strength of * emission as a function of metallicity and ionization parameter .",
    "the models were constructed with version 08.00 of cloudy , last described by @xcite .",
    "we employ an input ionizing spectrum from starburst99 @xcite , assuming continuous star formation and a metallicity of @xmath201 , or @xmath202 .",

    "we use cloudy s default  region abundance set , and in addition consider models with the fe abundance reduced by factors of 0.8 , 0.6 , 0.4 , and 0.2 for each of the metallicities adopted .",
    "each model is characterized by an ionization parameter @xmath211 , which is defined as the ratio of ionizing photon density to total hydrogen density , @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the rate of ionizing photons ( number s@xmath2 , given by the starburst99 model used to construct the input ionizing spectrum ) , @xmath214 is the distance from the ionizing source to the inner edge of the cloud , and @xmath215 is the hydrogen density .",
    "the models assume a spherical  region , but the geometry is effectively plane parallel if the thickness of the cloud is less than @xmath216 ; this is the case for all of our models except those with the highest values of the ionization parameter considered , @xmath217 .",
    "the models use cloudy s default stopping criterion , in all cases stopping when the temperature falls below 4000 k.    results of the photoionization modeling are shown in figure [ fig : cloudy ] .",
    "we plot the ratio of each of the * lines to [ ]  @xmath53626 , 3729 against the logarithm of the dimensionless ionization parameter @xmath211 , which represents the ratio of ionizing photons to particles .",
    "( it is more standard to measure the strength of a line of interest against a recombination line such as @xmath218 , but [ ]  is the only strong nebular emission line for which we have measurements . )",
    "the [ ] / * ratio shows little metallicity dependence but decreases strongly with increasing ionization parameter , driven largely by the decrease in [ ]  ( and corresponding increase in [ ] ) as ionization parameter increases .",
    "grey horizontal lines show the measured ratios for individual spectra in our sample .",
    "it is clear that , in order to match the observed ratios , a very high ionization parameter of @xmath219 is required .",
    "we do not have ionization parameter measurements for the galaxies in our sample , but measurements of lensed galaxies at @xmath4  suggest that typical star - forming galaxies at these redshifts have @xmath220 @xcite , higher than values observed in most local galaxies but lower than needed to produced our observed [ ] / * ratios .",
    "we also note two additional factors .",
    "first , the measured line ratios are not corrected for dust extinction .",
    "this is unlikely to be a large effect , given the relatively narrow wavelength separation , but the effect of dust would decrease the * lines relative to [ ] , making the observed [ ] / * ratios higher than the intrinsic ratios and further increasing the ionization parameter needed to match the data .",
    "second , all of the models shown assume cloudy s default  region o / fe ratio , which may not be appropriate given that an underabundance of the fe - peak elements relative to @xmath221-capture elements ( such as o ) has been observed in lensed galaxies at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "we have tested the effect of a decreased abundance of fe relative to o in the cloudy models ; the effect is to weaken the * emission , increase the [ ] / * ratio , and thereby increase the ionization parameter needed to match the observations . in other words , a decreased abundance of fe relative to o shifts all of the colored points in figure [ fig : cloudy ] upwards .    in summary",
    ", it is unlikely that that the galaxies in our sample would have ionization parameters high enough to produce the required [ ] / * ratios , and it is therefore also unlikely that the observed * emission originates in the  regions of the galaxies .",
    "next we examine the question of .",
    "in contrast to * ( and resonant ) emission , emission from  is observed in local  regions @xcite , so it is important to assess the likely sources of this emission in high redshift galaxies . in figure",
    "[ fig : cloudy_mg2 ] we plot the predicted ratios of [ ]  to  @xmath174 and @xmath222 emission against the ionization parameter , color - coding by metallicity as in figure [ fig : cloudy ] .",
    "the observed ratios are shown by the grey horizontal lines ; unlike the [ ] / * ratios , they are fully consistent with the expected ionization parameters of @xmath223 to @xmath224 .",
    "the photoionization modeling therefore indicates that , in contrast to the * emission , much of the  emission may arise in  regions . because  is a resonance line , however , photons produced in  regions then scatter in outflowing gas , producing the observed blueshifted absorption and redshifted emission profiles .",
    "we have suggested above ( section [ sec : individual ] ) that  emission in star - forming galaxies at @xmath1902 is similar to @xmath12  emission at @xmath43 , in that it exhibits a complex profile of combined emission and absorption ; we have also seen that  emission is more common in low mass and less dusty galaxies .",
    "the photoionization modeling supports this connection , indicating that  emission , like that of @xmath12 , arises from the resonant scattering of photons produced in  regions .",
    "thus the production of  photons in  regions is likely to account for the difference between the profiles of  and that of  lines not coupled to fine structure transitions such as  @xmath225 . for example , the spectra of q1623-bm95 and q1700-bm154 , shown in figures [ fig : ind_fespecs ] and [ fig : mg2profiles ] , show weak to moderate  @xmath225 absorption with no associated emission , while their  profiles show strong redshifted emission accompanied by weak blueshifted absorption . under the assumption that emission is produced by the scattering of continuum photons produced in the outflow",
    ", one would expect to see similar emission in the  and  @xmath225 lines ; instead we see much stronger emission in the  transitions , accounted for by the production of  photons in  regions and their subsequent resonant scattering .",
    "a comparison of the predicted strengths of  @xmath174 and  @xmath225 emission in the photoionization models supports this conclusion ; for ionization parameters @xmath223 to @xmath224 , emission from mgii  @xmath174 is @xmath226 times stronger than  @xmath225 emission . we therefore expect scattered emission from  regions to be much more significant for  than for  @xmath225 .",
    "more detailed photoionization modeling in the future may address the question of whether the [ ]  and  emission arise from the same parts of the  regions ; according to @xcite ,  emission from  regions arises primarily from recombinations in the outer layers .",
    "an additional question which can not be addressed by our current models and data is that of additional sources of [ ]  emission .",
    "[ ]  emission from diffused ionized gas is seen in local galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and is likely present in higher redshift galaxies as well .",
    "however , the cloudy models do not provide predictions for such emission or absolute [ ]  luminosities with which to compare our measurements , and our observations do not have the spatial resolution necessary to address this question ( though see section [ sec : spatialextent ] below , where we show that the [ ]  emission has the same spatial distribution as the stellar continuum , indicating that most of the emission does not arise in an extended outflow ) .",
    "our observed [ ] /  ratios are consistent with emission from both ions arising in  regions , but other sources of [ ]  emission can not be ruled out .",
    "future , more detailed modeling and observations with higher sensitivity and spatial resolution will address this question .    to summarize the results of this subsection",
    ", the photoionization modeling indicates different mechanisms for the production of * and  emission .",
    "although both ultimately arise in the outflow , * emission arises from the re - emission of continuum photons absorbed in the  resonance transitions , while the resonant scattering of photons originally produced in  regions accounts for much of the  emission .",
    "if the * emission originates in a large - scale galactic outflow , it may have a more extended spatial distribution than the stellar continuum ; similarly , resonant scattering of  photons in outflowing gas may produce spatially extended  emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite study * and  emission in a galaxy at @xmath17 , finding that  emission is broader than the stellar continuum and extends to distances of @xmath227 kpc .",
    "likewise , @xcite use deep narrowband images to show that diffuse @xmath12  emission surrounds galaxies at @xmath4  to distances of @xmath19 kpc ; the @xmath12  transition is similar to  in its radiative transfer properties .    in order to assess the spatial extent of  and * emission in our sample",
    "we create two - dimensional composite spectra and compare the spatial extent of the line emission relative to the stellar continuum .",
    "we also construct a 2d composite [ ]  spectrum for comparison .",
    "the 2d composite spectra are created by cutting out a 100   region around the line of interest in each individual spectrum .",
    "these cutouts are also centered spatially ( but without spatial resampling ) on the object , using the object positions stored in the image header by the deep2 reduction pipeline .",
    "the cutouts are then resampled to a common dispersion of 20 km  s@xmath2  per pixel using linear interpolation , and the appropriate 2d wavelength solution is applied to each cutout . because the original two - dimensional spectra are rectified and because we consider only a short range in wavelength , the object traces are not curved and the wavelength does not depend on spatial location along the slit .",
    "we then measure the centroid of the object position in each spectrum ( since the positions in the header are not exact ) , and use these measurements to construct spatial offsets used to combine the individual spectra .",
    "further details of the combination depend on the line considered and are described below .",
    "the  composite includes only the 33 galaxies with  emission , determined as described in section [ sec : mg2uvcolor ] .",
    "because the peak velocity of  emission varies significantly in individual spectra , we shift each 2d spectrum both spectrally and spatially , centering on the peak of the emission , and combine the individual spectra using a s / n - weighted average .",
    "we measure the extent of * emission using the strongest of the * lines , * @xmath130 .",
    "we combine the full sample ( 95 of the 96 galaxies in the sample have spectral coverage of the * @xmath130 line ) , aligning each spectrum spatially and again combining using a s / n - weighted average . for the [ ]  composite , we combine the 51 galaxies with [ ]  emission , again aligning each spectrum spatially and combining using a s / n - weighted average . in all three cases",
    "we then average the two sides of the composites in order to increase s / n .",
    "we determine uncertainties by creating 500 artificial 2d composite spectra using bootstrap resampling : we measure the average and standard deviation of the line and continuum profiles in the 500 artificial spectra , and take the @xmath158 uncertainties in the spatial profiles to be the standard deviation of their measurements in the sample of artificial spectra .",
    "the two - dimensional composite spectra for the three lines are shown in figure [ fig:2dspecs ] .",
    "spatial profiles of the line emission and stellar continuum are shown in figure [ fig : spatialprofiles ] .",
    "the top two panels show  emission : at left , we compare the  emission profile ( red ) with that of the stellar continuum ( black ) , where the continuum has been scaled by a factor of 1.6 to have the same peak value as the  emission .",
    "the blue dotted line shows the point spread function , measured from the average spatial profiles of two stars appearing on the masks . in the upper right panel",
    "we show the difference between the line and continuum emission .",
    "the  emission is slightly stronger at larger distances , reaching a peak excess of 40% greater than the scaled continuum at a radius of 0.8 arcsec .    in the middle two panels we show the same comparison for the weaker * emission . in this case",
    "we scale the stellar continuum by a factor of 1.15 to match the peak * flux , and find that the * emission is also somewhat more extended than the continuum , though with a smaller excess ; the difference between line and continuum peaks at @xmath228 arcsec , with a 10% excess in the line flux relative to the scaled continuum .",
    "although this is a smaller excess than we see in the  emission , we detect it with comparable significance because of the larger sample of galaxies used in the * composite . because the * emission lines are stronger in galaxies with  emission ( see section [ sec : emission ] ) , a natural additional test would be to measure the excess * emission in galaxies with  emission ; unfortunately",
    ", however , the sample of  emitters is too small to enable sufficient s / n to make this measurement .",
    "the bottom two panels of figure [ fig : spatialprofiles ] show the comparison of the spatial profile of [ ]  emission relative to the continuum .",
    "[ ]  emission is expected to arise primarily in  regions , and because it is not a resonance line , its spatial distribution should trace that of the star - forming regions of the galaxy , with any differences with respect to the continuum emission arising from differing spatial distributions of the hot young stars producing the  regions and the older stars responsible for the continuum ( or , at larger radii , the possible generation of [ ]  emission in the outflow ) .",
    "figure [ fig : spatialprofiles ] shows that the [ ]  emission indeed follows the spatial distribution of the continuum closely .",
    "there is no excess of line emission at @xmath229 arcsec , as is observed for  and * emission ; instead the [ ]  emission is slightly weaker than the continuum at @xmath230 arcsec , although the significance of this result is marginal .",
    "we conclude from this test of the spatial distribution of [ ]  emission that the observed excesses in  and  are not an artifact of the comparison of stronger line emission with weaker continuum .    we have presented evidence that both  and * ( but not [ ] ) emission are slightly more spatially extended than the underlying stellar continuum , with excess relative to the continuum detected at the @xmath1822@xmath6 level .",
    "this supports the conclusion that these emission lines arise in outflowing gas , though higher s / n measurements are clearly needed .",
    "the s / n of the stacked spectra we use to make this measurement is only just high enough to detect a difference in the spatial distribution of lines and continuum , but not high enough to measure line emission to significantly larger radii than the continuum .",
    "detections of extended @xmath12  emission to distances of @xmath19 kpc @xcite suggest that such emission could be present at much larger distances , but the weakness of  and * emission relative to @xmath12  mean that such detections at high redshift are likely out of the reach of current technology .",
    "we conclude our discussion of the origins of * emission with a comparison of the relative strengths of the * emission lines and their associated  absorption . as shown in figure [",
    "fig : energylevels ] , each of the fine structure emission lines is coupled to an absorption line which provides the source of the emitted photons .",
    "the generic expectation for the model in which * emission is produced by photons absorbed in  transitions in the outflow is that * emission will increase as  absorption increases .",

    "requires that the total emission and absorption equivalent widths sum to zero ; thus , in the absence of dust or particular geometric effects , we expect the total emission and absorption strengths to be approximately the same",
    ". note also that the absorbed photons may be re - emitted as emission at their original wavelength rather than through one of the fine structure transitions , producing a p cygni - like profile ; whether or not this is likely to happen depends on the probabilities of the transitions involved and on the details of the galaxy , including the spatial and velocity distribution of outflowing gas , the presence of an interstellar medium at zero velocity , and the dust content .",
    "we show the expected relationship between absorption and emission in figure [ fig : pkr ] , which shows the predicted equivalent widths of the  @xmath602600 and * @xmath602626 lines in all of the models considered by @xcite .",
    "the points represent a wide variety of outflow scenarios rather than a range of galaxies within the same model ; thus they should be taken simply as a generic prediction of how increasing one line affects the other .",
    "the left panel compares the strengths of  @xmath602600 absorption and * @xmath602626 emission , and shows that , although there is considerable scatter , * @xmath602626 emission generally increases as  @xmath602600 absorption increases .",
    "the right panel shows that much of the scatter is due to the fraction of emission which escapes at 2600   rather than at 2626  ; except in cases with significant extinction or particular outflow geometry , the sum of the total emission and absorption is approximately zero .",
    "the outliers ( points falling far from the solid line in the right panel of figure [ fig : pkr ] ) represent either non - spherically symmetric models or models with significant dust content .",
    "these models show that either dust or geometry alone can cause large deviations from the simple conservation of photons .    in figure",
    "[ fig : emabs_ew ] we plot the equivalent width of each of the * emission lines against its associated absorption line , for each of the composite spectra ( note that because of the varying overlap of the samples used for the various composites , as discussed in section [ sec : compspecs ] , the points on these plots are not all independent ) .",
    "we focus the following discussion primarily on the  @xmath602600 absorption and * @xmath602626 emission lines , since * @xmath602626 is the strongest of the * lines , but ( with some exceptions noted below ) the paired lines follow similar trends .    as already noted , * emission is stronger in less massive and less dusty galaxies and in galaxies with  emission . it is also immediately apparent that we see a trend of _ decreasing _ * @xmath602626 emission with increasing  @xmath602600 absorption , the opposite of what we expect based on the model described above .",
    "we have not included  @xmath602600 emission in this comparison , since it is not significantly ( @xmath231 ) detected in any of the composites ; however , examination of figure [ fig : allcomposites ] shows some evidence for redshifted p cygni  @xmath602600 emission in the low mass and low @xmath82 composites .",
    "these are the only spectra in which the emission is detected at @xmath232 significance ; we find @xmath233   in the low mass composite , and @xmath234   in the low @xmath82 composite .",
    "these two composites already show relatively weak  @xmath602600 absorption and strong * @xmath602626 emission , so including emission at 2600   simply increases the imbalance between total emission and absorption in these samples .",
    "more generally ,  @xmath602600 emission decreases as the optical depth of the transition increases , and the @xcite models show that little to no emission is seen when an ism component is present in the galaxy .",
    "our observations therefore suggest higher optical depth in higher mass and dustier galaxies , possibly due to a more significant interstellar medium .",
    "@xcite also find that symmetric  absorption centered at zero velocity is significantly stronger in more massive galaxies , and @xcite find more absorption at @xmath235 km  s@xmath2  in galaxies with higher baryonic ( gas + stellar ) and dynamical mass at @xmath4 .",
    "a more significant ism in more massive galaxies does not account for the observed decrease in * emission with increasing  absorption , however , since the presence of an ism increases both the absorption and total emission , while shifting the emission from the resonance lines to the fine structure transitions .",
    "the fact that the total absorption is stronger than the total emission in all spectra may be attributable to dust ; the @xcite models indicate that the effect of dust is to suppress the emission with relatively little effect on the absorption profile . as noted above , the * @xmath602626 emission profile in the composite spectrum of the full sample shows evidence for extinction in the lack of redshifted emission relative to blueshifted emission .",
    "furthermore , extinction may at least in part explain the observed trend in @xmath236 vs.  @xmath237 , if dust attenuates a larger fraction of the emission in massive galaxies .",
    "this does not at first appear to be a satisfactory explanation , since the average value of @xmath82 is slightly higher in the low mass sample than in the high mass sample .",
    "on the other hand , as discussed in section [ sec : compspecs ] , uncertainties in the extinction law for young galaxies suggest that @xmath82 for this sample may be overestimated , and independent measurements of extinction from _",
    "24  imaging indicate that , on average , dust attenuation is larger in more massive galaxies @xcite . even if this is the case , however , the magnitude of the effect does not appear to be sufficient .",
    "@xcite model the effects of dust as a function of the optical depth @xmath238 , finding that flux is reduced by a factor of @xmath239 ; in order to suppress the emission to the observed degree in the high mass and high dust samples , @xmath240 is required , while our values of @xmath82 ( which do not suffer from the systematic uncertainties affecting the lower mass sample ) indicate @xmath2412 for these samples .",
    "@xcite also consider a dust+ism model .",
    "as discussed above , the effect of an ism component is to increase both the absorption and total emission , while shifting the emission from the resonance lines to the fine structure transitions ; if the ism is also dusty , the emission is further reduced , particularly in the resonance lines .",
    "however , the dust+ism model with @xmath242 still exhibits increased emission relative to the fiducial , dust - free model , indicating that the increase in both absorption and emission outweighs the effect of dust ; this is counter to our observations of weaker emission in more massive galaxies with more significant ism .",
    "it may be that such a model with somewhat higher dust content would sufficiently suppress the emission without obscuring it entirely ; more detailed modeling is needed , and some degree of fine tuning of the dust content would seem to be required to match the observations . for the moment",
    "we conclude that dust is an important factor but may not be the only explanation for the observed trend .",
    "the remaining factor is the geometry of the absorbing and emitting regions .",
    "anisotropic outflows viewed from certain directions may produce observed absorption to emission ratios that deviate from the expected conservation of photons ; in particular , a galaxy with a bi - conical outflow observed edge - on will show no absorption but strong emission .",
    "thus observations of individual galaxies at a variety of inclinations could produce a trend similar to the observed @xmath236 vs.  @xmath237 relationship .",
    "this is unlikely to be the explanation for the current sample , however , since our data points are for composite spectra of galaxies selected without regard to inclination or morphology .",

    "law , private communication ) , and in any case such a bias would result in stronger emission and weaker absorption for the dustier subsample , the opposite of what is observed . ]",
    "the last issue we consider is the size of the * -emitting region relative to the area encompassed by the spectroscopic slit .",
    "if fine structure emission occurs in outflowing gas at large distances from galaxies , the emitting region may be larger than the region subtended by the slit ; the broader the extent of the emission , the higher the fraction that may fall outside the slit . in this context ,",
    "previous observations of low ionization absorption and fine structure emission in far - uv spectra at high redshift provide useful insights ; the resonant  absorption lines are coupled to non - resonant * emission in the same fashion as the  lines studied in this work .",
    "@xcite detected * fine structure emission accompanying  absorption in the composite spectrum of lyman break galaxies at @xmath243 , finding that the emission lines were too strong to be produced in the  regions of the galaxies but much weaker than the  absorption lines .",
    "although they found no fully satisfactory explanation for the * lines ( outflow models were deemed inadequate due to the narrowness of the * lines relative to @xmath12 ) , they suggested that the weakness of the * lines could be due to the spectroscopic slit subtending only a small portion of the emitting region .",
    "more recently , @xcite compare the composite spectra of lyman break galaxies at @xmath244 and @xmath243 , and find that galaxies at @xmath244 have stronger * emission but weaker  absorption than galaxies at @xmath245 , the same pattern we observe in the  lines in low and high mass ( and age , sfr , and dust ) galaxies at @xmath3 .",
    "they interpret this pattern as evidence that  photons are absorbed and re - emitted at larger distances at @xmath243 than at @xmath244 .",
    "if slit losses are in part responsible for the weakness of the fine structure emission lines , significant absorption in the resonance lines must occur at large distances from the galaxies .",
    "recent results indicate that this is likely to be the case . @xcite use stacked spectra of paired foreground and background galaxies to measure the strength of low ionization absorption as a function of impact parameter , finding @xmath246   at a mean distance of 31 kpc in both the  @xmath247 and @xmath248 lines .",
    "the strength of  @xmath247 remains the same at 63 kpc , and significant absorption in @xmath12  is seen at @xmath249 kpc .",
    "@xcite also see low surface brightness @xmath12  emission extending to @xmath19 kpc . in a study of  absorption systems and [ ]",
    "emission at @xmath250 , @xcite conclude that outflows are the primary source of  absorption systems , and that outflowing gas can reach radii of @xmath156 kpc .",
    "these results indicate that significant absorption and emission are likely to take place beyond the radius subtended by the slit ; the 1  and 1.2  slits used in our study subtend distances of 810 kpc for galaxies at @xmath251 .",
    "the models of @xcite also assess the effect of slit loss .",
    "the fraction of absorption and emission at large radius depends on the wind model considered ; for most models , they find that @xmath229  slits are sufficient to capture most of the emission in high redshift galaxies .",
    "a notable exception is the radiation - pressure - driven wind model of @xcite , for which a slit subtending @xmath720 kpc is required to admit most of the scattered photons .",
    "given the detection of significant resonant absorption at large radius in similar galaxies at @xmath4 , we suggest that , along with dust , increasing slit losses in massive galaxies may explain the observed trend of decreasing * @xmath602626 emission with increasing  @xmath602600 absorption . in this scenario ,",
    "the smaller ratio of emission to absorption strength observed in high mass ( age , dust , sfr ) galaxies is an indication that  photons are absorbed and re - emitted at greater distances from the galaxy than in lower mass and less dusty objects .",
    "this is consistent with the observation in section [ sec : maxvels ] that massive galaxies have higher wind velocities .",
    "we also find support for this scenario in observations of a single low mass galaxy ; @xcite studied  absorption and * emission in a compact , unreddened galaxy at @xmath252 , finding that the emission and absorption strengths were roughly equal . in this galaxy ,",
    "very few of the * photons are lost to dust or fall outside the slit .",
    "a prediction of this slit - loss model is that * @xmath602626 emission should be more extended in high mass galaxies than in low mass galaxies .",
    "we test this by constructing two - dimensional composite spectra of the high and low mass samples as described in section [ sec : spatialextent ] , again determining uncertainties from the standard deviation of the spatial profiles of 500 artificial 2d composite spectra created using bootstrap resampling .",
    "the 2d spectra are shown in figure [ fig : highlowmass_2d ] , and the spatial profiles are shown in figure [ fig : spatialprofiles_mass ] . in the top two panels of figure [ fig : spatialprofiles_mass ]",
    "we show the * @xmath602626 spatial profiles at left and the difference between the profiles in the high and low mass samples at right .",
    "although the uncertainties are significant , we find that at a radius of 1  the flux of the high mass sample is nearly 5 times that of the low mass sample ; the difference in flux at 1   is @xmath253 , for a significance of 1.9@xmath6 .",
    "we also observe excess emission to @xmath182 , with lower significance .",
    "this difference between the emission line profiles in the high and low mass galaxies can be further clarified by comparisons of the * line emission and the continuum for the high and low mass samples .",
    "the relevant spatial profiles are shown in the lower two panels of figure [ fig : spatialprofiles_mass ] . a comparison of the line and continuum emission in the high mass sample shows that the emission line flux is @xmath254% higher at a radius of 0.81.1 arcsec ; this difference is not statistically significant , however , given the large uncertainties associated with the small high and low mass samples . a similar comparison of the line and continuum emission in the low mass sample shows that the two profiles are the same to within 5% .",
    "finally , we compare the continuum profiles of the high and low mass samples .",
    "massive galaxies are observed to be larger than low mass galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and a comparison of the continuum profiles to the psf in the lower two panels of figure [ fig : spatialprofiles_mass ] suggests that this is also the case in our sample .",
    "more quantitatively , at a radius of 0.81.1 arcsec the continuum emission from massive galaxies is @xmath255% higher than the continuum emission from low mass galaxies , but as with the line and continuum comparison above , this difference is not statistically significant .",
    "thus the more extended line emission observed for high mass galaxies shown in the upper left panel of figure [ fig : spatialprofiles_mass ] appears to be due to a combination of extended line emission in massive galaxies and the larger sizes of massive galaxies ; neither of these effects are statistically significant alone , but in combination they produce the moderately more significant difference between the * profiles in high and low mass galaxies . in summary ,",
    "the observation of more extended emission from the outflow in more massive galaxies supports the scenario in which slit losses are more significant for more massive galaxies .",
    "a definitive test requires the detection of emission at much larger radii , but the weakness of the fine structure lines is likely to preclude this test for some time .    a second important test of the model is a comparison of the strength of absorption as a function of impact parameter for both high and low mass galaxies , using pairs of foreground and background galaxies or galaxies with background quasars .",
    "the scenario presented here predicts stronger low ionization metal line absorption at larger radii for more massive galaxies .",
    "such results have already been found for galaxies associated with  absorption systems at lower redshifts @xcite , and the coming years will see such studies extended to the redshifts probed by this sample and higher .",
    "we have thus far focused discussion on the  @xmath602600 absorption and * @xmath602626 emission lines , as * @xmath602626 is the strongest of the * lines . although we do not detect all of the * lines in all of the composites , the other lines in the uv1 multiplet show the same trend of stronger emission and weaker absorption in low mass galaxies ; we measure only upper limits on * @xmath602612 and * @xmath602632 in the high mass composites .",
    "the uv2 multiplet presents a confusing picture , however . in this case",
    "we observe weaker absorption and stronger emission in the high mass and high dust samples , although galaxies with  emission also show weaker absorption and stronger emission .",
    "the explanation for these mixed results is unclear . in the uv3 multiplet",
    "we again observe weaker absorption in the low mass sample than in the high mass , but the * @xmath602365 line is too weak to lead to useful conclusions regarding the emission . as the uv2 observations partially conflict with our proposed model , further study of these lines is needed .",
    "we have shown that the average velocity profile of * @xmath602626 emission , photoionization modeling , and the extent of the emission relative to the continuum support the scenario in which fine structure emission is generated by photon scattering in outflowing gas .",
    "greater extinction and/or a greater spatial extent of outflowing gas in massive galaxies is required to explain the observed decrease in * emission with increasing  absorption .",
    "we have presented measurements of rest - frame near - uv  and  absorption and emission in a sample of 96 star - forming galaxies at @xmath256 .",
    "the presence of large - scale galactic outflows is indicated by the blueshift of interstellar absorption lines relative to the systemic velocity .",
    "our primary results are as follows .    1 .",
    "for 51 of the 96 galaxies , we obtain systemic redshifts from the centroids of strong [ ]  @xmath5 3726 , 3729 emission , which falls at the red end of the spectral range covered .",
    "these galaxies have an average redshift @xmath257 .",
    "interstellar  absorption lines in these galaxies show an average offset from the systemic velocity of @xmath64 km  s@xmath2 , less than the average offset of @xmath258 km  s@xmath2  measured for galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "we use this offset of @xmath64 km  s@xmath2  to estimate the systemic redshift of the remainder of the galaxies in the sample .",
    "we also show that the average velocity offset decreases from @xmath259 km  s@xmath2  at @xmath70 to @xmath260 km  s@xmath2  at @xmath68 .",
    "these higher redshift samples have a slightly higher average mass than our @xmath13 sample , and have velocity offsets measured from far - uv interstellar absorption lines rather than the near - uv  lines used in this study .",
    "more careful accounting of these selection effects , and of the effects of the interstellar medium on the velocity measurements , is therefore required to determine whether the decrease in velocity offset with decreasing redshift represents a real trend of decreasing outflow velocity .",
    "2 .   individual galaxies in the sample show more variety in the  doublet than in the  resonance lines .",
    "is always seen in absorption , while  ranges from strong emission to pure absorption .",
    "emission is more common in galaxies with bluer uv slopes , echoing far - uv observations of galaxies at @xmath44 in which @xmath12  emission is stronger in bluer galaxies .",
    "emission is also stronger in low mass galaxies , and fine structure * emission is stronger in galaxies with  emission .",
    "we compare the velocities and equivalent widths of the  and  transitions in individual spectra , in order to assess the effect of emission filling on measurements of outflow velocity .",
    "underlying emission appears to shift the velocity centroid of the  @xmath124 line to the blue in @xmath261 of the sample , while the  @xmath163 line shows such a shift in @xmath137 of the sample .",
    "studies of individual objects suggest that emission filling may be a stronger effect in low mass galaxies , but composite spectra show little difference in velocity centroids between the  lines expected to be most and least affected by emission filling .",
    "is much more clearly affected by underlying emission .",
    "4 .   the average maximum outflow velocity ( the maximum extent of the blue wing of the interstellar absorption lines in the composite spectrum of all of the galaxies in the sample ) is @xmath178 km  s@xmath2 , in good agreement with other studies of star - forming galaxies at @xmath3  2 .",
    "@xmath262 is 1.5 times larger in the high mass subset of galaxies than in the low mass subset , consistent with previous results indicating @xmath263 .",
    "the velocity centroids @xmath264 are also blueshifted to higher velocities in the composite of high mass galaxies than in the low mass composite . unlike some previous studies",
    ", we see no trend between @xmath176 and star formation rate .",
    "5 .   we present the following evidence in support of the model in which * and  emission is generated by photon scattering in outflowing gas : *   the velocity profile of * @xmath130 emission in the composite spectrum of the full sample of galaxies shows a blueshifted tail very similar to that of the  @xmath265 absorption line , from which the emission is presumed to arise . *",
    "photoionization modeling indicates that very high values of the ionization parameter , @xmath266 , are required in order for the * emission to originate in  regions .",
    "the ionization parameters of the galaxies in the sample are unlikely to be this high , implying that * emission is produced by the re - emission of continuum photons absorbed in the  resonance transitions in outflowing gas . * in contrast to * emission , photoionization modeling shows that the strength of  emission is consistent with its production in  regions .",
    "we conclude that  photons from  regions resonantly scatter in outflowing gas , producing the observed blueshifted absorption and redshifted emission profiles . *",
    "we compare the spatial extent of  and * emission relative to the continuum , and find that both emission lines are moderately more extended .",
    "higher s / n measurements are needed to more robustly confirm this trend and measure the true extent of the emission . 6 .   using composite spectra",
    ", we observe a trend of _ decreasing _ * emission with increasing  absorption .",
    "this trend is the opposite of what one would naively expect , if the * photons are originally absorbed in the  transitions .",
    "we attribute this trend to a combination of increased extinction in more massive galaxies and more extended outflows in massive galaxies , leading to greater slit losses for * photons .",
    "two - dimensional composite spectra of high and low mass galaxies indicate that emission from the outflow is stronger at a radius of @xmath193 kpc in high mass galaxies than in low mass galaxies .",
    "our results suggest that  and * emission provide a valuable but so far little - utilized tool for the study of galactic outflows .",
    "in particular , as telescope capabilities develop , studies of the spatial extent of these lines may allow important measurements of the physical extent of outflowing gas .",
    "these lines are accessible from the ground over a wide range in redshift , from @xmath21 to @xmath4 , and complement the far - uv lines studied in galaxies at @xmath267 and above .                                          ,",
