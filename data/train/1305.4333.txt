    "genetic epidemiology is a research field which aims to identify genetic polymorphisms that involve in disease susceptibility .",
    "usual candidate polymorphisms include restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( rflps ) , variable numbers of tandem repeats ( vntrs ) and single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) . in recent years , snps are the most common choices due to simplicity and cost reduction in identification protocols .",
    "snps in diploid organisms are excellent bi - allelic genetic markers for various studies including genetic association , gene - gene interaction and gene - environment interaction .",
    "the availability of multiple snps on the same gene can also lead to haplotype analysis where genotypes of interest can be phased into pairs of haplotypes .",
    "traditional techniques for identification of relationship between a single snp and disease susceptibility status involve various univariate statistical tests including @xmath0 and odds ratio tests  @xcite .",
    "however , many complementary computational techniques have been developed in the past decade to handle problems that involve multiple snps .",
    "heidema et al .",
    "@xcite have categorised these multi - locus techniques , which are capable of identifying a candidate snp set from possible snps , into parametric and non - parametric methods .",
    "examples of parametric method cover logistic regression techniques  @xcite and neural networks  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "examples of non - parametric method include a set association approach  @xcite , combinatorial techniques  @xcite and recursive partitioning techniques  @xcite . in",
    "some of mentioned parametric  @xcite and non - parametric  @xcite methods , pattern recognition and classification approaches have been successfully implemented as their core engines .",
    "in addition to single and multiple snp analysis , haplotype analysis has also gained attention from genetic epidemiologists .",
    "haplotypes provide a record of evolutionary history more accurately than individual snps .",
    "further , haplotypes can capture the patterns of linkage disequilibrium ( ld)a phenomenon where snps that are located in close proximity tend to travel together  in genome more accurately .",
    "therefore , haplotypes may enable susceptibility gene identification in complex diseases more effectively than individual snps  @xcite . in lieu of this evidence ,",
    "haplotype analysis should also be considered in addition to direct genotype analysis .",
    "many computational techniques use haplotypes , which are inferred from multiple snps , as problem inputs .",
    "for instance , sham et al .",
    "@xcite proposes a logistic regression technique that produces a mapping model between haplotypes and disease status while becker et al .",
    "@xcite combine haplotype explanation probabilities of given genotypes from multiple gene or unlinked region data into a scalar statistic for a univariate test .",
    "nonetheless , haplotypes have rarely been used as inputs for non - parametric classifiers for genetic association and interaction studies .    in this paper ,",
    "a variable - length haplotype construction for gene - gene interaction ( varhap ) technique is proposed .",
    "the technique will involve non - parametric classification where haplotypes inferred from multiple snp data are the classifier inputs .",
    "the chosen architecture for non - parametric classifier is the multifactor dimensionality reduction ( mdr ) technique  @xcite .",
    "similar to the original mdr technique , the proposed technique would be able to identify appropriate candidate snps from possible snps and can be used in case - control genetic interaction studies .",
    "however , the technique would also be able to handle the situation where disease susceptibility is detectable in different haplotype backgrounds .",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : mdrandhaplotype ] , a brief explanation of mdr and the techniques for inferring haplotypes and obtaining haplotype explanation probability is given .",
    "the proposed varhap technique is then described in section  [ sec : varhap ] .",
    "the test data and their description is given in section  [ sec : datasets ] .",
    "next , the results and discussions are described in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , the conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "mdr is a classifier - based technique that is capable of identifying the best genetic marker combination among possible markers for the separation between case and control samples .",
    "similar to other classification systems , a @xmath1-fold cross - validation technique provides a means to determine the classification accuracy of the candidate marker model .",
    "basically , the combined case and control samples are randomly divided into @xmath1 folds where @xmath2 folds of samples are used to construct a decision table for the classifier while the remaining fold of samples is used to identify the prediction capability of the constructed decision table .",
    "the decision table construction and testing procedure is repeated @xmath1 times .",
    "hence , the samples in each fold will always be utilised both to construct and to test the decision table .",
    "the number of cells in a decision table is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of candidate markers selected from possible markers and @xmath5 is the number of possible genotypes according to the marker . for a snp , which is a bi - allelic marker , @xmath5 is equal to three . during the decision table construction , each cell in the table",
    "is filled with case and control samples that have their genotype corresponds to the cell label .",
    "the ratio between numbers of case and control samples will provide the decision for each cell whether the corresponding genotype is a disease - predisposing or protective genotype .",
    "an example of decision table construction is illustrated in figure  [ fig : mdrtable ] .",
    "the prediction accuracy of the decision table is subsequently evaluated by counting the numbers of case and control samples in the testing fold that their disease status can be correctly identified using the constructed decision rules . the process of decision table construction and evaluation must be cycled through all or some of possible @xmath6 combinations where @xmath7 is the total number of available markers in the study . the best genetic marker combination is determined from three criteria : prediction accuracy , cross - validation consistency and a sign test _ p_-value .",
    "each time that a testing fold is used for prediction accuracy determination , the accuracy of the interested marker combination model can be compared with that from other models that also contain the same number of markers .",
    "the model that consistently ranks the first in comparison to other choices with the same amount of markers would have high cross - validation consistency . the non - parametric sign test _",
    "p_-value is calculated from the number of testing folds with accuracy greater than or equal to 50% .",
    "this single - tailed _",
    "p_-value is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the total number of cross - validation folds and @xmath10 is the number of cross - validation folds with testing accuracy @xmath11  @xcite . among three criteria ,",
    "prediction accuracy is the main criterion for decision making while the other criteria are only used as auxiliary measures .",
    "cross - validation consistency generally confirms that the high rank model can be consistently identified regardless of how the samples are divided for cross - validation . on the other hand , a sign test _",
    "p_-value indicates the number of testing folds with acceptable prediction accuracy and hence describes the usability of the model in the classification task .",
    "in the situation where two or more models with different number of markers are equally good in terms of prediction accuracy , cross - validation consistency and sign test _",
    "p_-value , the most parsimonious model",
    " the combination with the least number of markers  will be the best model .          with the availability of multiple snps from the same gene ,",
    "haplotypes can be inferred from given genotypes .",
    "let `` 0 ` ' and `` 1 ` ' denote the major ( common ) and minor ( rare ) alleles at a snp location in a haplotype .",
    "a genotype can then be represented by a string , which consists of three characters : `` 0 ` ' , `` 1 ` ' and `` 2 ` ' . in the genotype string ,",
    "`` 0 ` ' denotes a homozygous wide - type site , `` 1 ` ' denotes a heterozygous site and `` 2 ` ' denotes a homozygous variant or homozygous mutant site .",
    "a genotype with all homozygous sites or single heterozygous site can always be phased into one pair of haplotypes . on the other hand ,",
    "a genotype with multiple heterozygous sites can be phased into multiple haplotype pairs .",
    "for example , genotype ` 0102 ` leads to haplotypes ` 0001 ` and ` 0101 ` while genotype ` 0112 ` leads to two possible haplotype pairs : ` 0001/0111 ` and ` 0011/0101 ` .",
    "many algorithms exist for haplotype inference  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "an expectation - maximisation algorithm  @xcite is the chosen technique due to its simplicity and implementation efficacy .",
    "regardless of the inference technique employed , the usual result from an inference algorithm covers haplotype frequencies and possible haplotype phases of each genotype .      in a genomic region with multiple heterozygous sites , multiple pairs of haplotypes can be inferred from a given genotype .",
    "the probability of a genotype to be phased into one specific pair of haplotypes would depend on the frequencies of haplotypes constituting the pairs  @xcite .",
    "this probability is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the probability for haplotype pair @xmath14 , @xmath15 denotes the frequency of the @xmath16th haplotype , @xmath17 is the @xmath1th haplotype and @xmath18 represents the set of haplotype explanations which are compatible with the genotype of interest . for example , genotype ` 0110 ` can be phased into two haplotype pairs : ` 0000/0110 ` @xmath19 and ` 0010/0100 ` @xmath20 .",
    "if the frequencies for haplotypes ` 0000 ` , ` 0010 ` , ` 0100 ` and ` 0110 ` are respectively 0.5 , 0.2 , 0.2 and 0.1 , the probabilities for the pairs ` 0000/0110 ` and ` 0010/0100 ` are 0.556 and 0.444 .",
    "obviously , the probability of a genotype with all homozygous sites or single heterozygous site to be phased into a pair of haplotypes would be equal to one .",
    "in genetic interaction studies where the number of genes or unlinked regions is greater than one , the haplotype explanation probabilities from all regions can be combined together .",
    "an overall contribution by one sample to haplotype configuration @xmath21 in a study with @xmath22 genes / unlinked regions is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the contribution value and @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 . in the previous example where haplotypes from only one region are considered , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "notice that the sum of contribution values is equal to two ; this reflects the fact that each genotype is made up from two haplotypes .",
    "becker et al .",
    "@xcite use this contribution value in the construction of a contingency table where a @xmath0 test statistic is subsequently calculated . with the use of a monte carlo simulation , an estimated _ p_-value",
    "is then obtained for the test statistic .",
    "similar to the model exploration strategy in mdr , the process of contingency table construction and _ p_-value calculation can also be cycled through all or some of possible interaction models . the model with appropriate candidate snps taken from possible",
    "snps is the one with minimum _ p_-value and is said to be the best model for interaction explanation .",
    "this statistics - based procedure can be found as an integral part of the famhap program  @xcite .    ,",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are labelled as predisposing haplotype configurations while the cells with haplotype configurations @xmath39 and @xmath40 are labelled as protective haplotype configurations.,width=188 ]",
    "varhap is proposed for case - control interaction studies . similar to mdr , the technique is also a classifier - based technique .",
    "however , instead of using a genotype data analysis as a means to identify the best snp combination , the decision table for classification is constructed from the haplotype contribution value described earlier . as a result ,",
    "haplotypes with different lengths must be inferred during the search for the best model .",
    "the number of decision cells during the consideration on haplotypes constructed from a specific set of snps is governed by the total number of possible haplotype configurations as illustrated in figure  [ fig : varhaptable ] . in brief",
    ", varhap would maintain the ability to find the best snp combination while also be able to identify possible disease - predisposing and protective haplotype configurations .    since varhap is essentially a classification system , the principal criterion for choosing",
    "the optimal snp combination model is still the prediction accuracy .",
    "however , with the use of haplotype contribution value as a means for decision rule construction , an additional model selection criterion that exploits the nature of haplotype can be formulated .",
    "this criterion can be referred to as haplotype propagation capability .",
    "basically , if a haplotype constructed from a specific set of snps is related to disease susceptibility status , haplotypes constructed from a snp set which is a superset of the previously specified snps should also predict the same relationship .",
    "this implies that predisposing and protective haplotypes in a low - order model must be able to propagate into haplotypes in high - order models .",
    "for example , consider a single - gene problem with four possible snps : ` x1 ` , ` x2 ` , ` x3 ` and ` x4 ` . if haplotypes in the model with snps ` ( x2 , x4 ) ` are related to disease susceptibility , haplotypes in the models with snps ` ( x1 , x2 , x4 ) ` , ` ( x2 , x3 , x4 ) ` and ` ( x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) ` should produce the same result .",
    "the haplotype propagation capability , which is a dichotomous criterion , can be determined from the evidence that the sign test _ p_-value and the prediction accuracy can be maintained throughout the process of model order increment .",
    "again , in the situation where two or more models with different number of snps are equally good in terms of both prediction accuracy and haplotype propagation capability , the most parsimonious model will be the best model .    lcccccccccccc model & @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 + ep-1 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & 0 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.210 & 0.210 & 0.707 + ep-2 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.600 & 0.199 & 0.778 + ep-3 & @xmath52 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.577 & 0.577 & 0.900 + ep-4 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & 0 & @xmath52 & 0 & 0 & @xmath52 & 0 & 0 & 0.372 & 0.243 & 0.911 + ep-5 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & 0 & @xmath52 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.349 & 0.349 & 0.799 + ep-6 & 0 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & 0 & 0 & @xmath52 & 0 & 0 & 0.190 & 0.190 & 1.000 + het-1 & @xmath53 & @xmath53 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & @xmath53 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & 0 & 0.053 & 0.053 & 0.495 + het-2 & @xmath53 & @xmath53 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & 0 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & 0 & 0.279 & 0.040 & 0.660 + het-3 & @xmath53 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & 0 & 0 & @xmath52 & 0 & 0 & 0.194 & 0.194 & 1.000 + s-1 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & 0 & 0.052 & 0.052 & 0.522 + s-2 & 1 & 1 & 1 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & 0 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & 0 & 0.228 & 0.045 & 0.574 + s-3 & 1 & 1 & @xmath52 & 1 & @xmath52 & 0 & @xmath52 & 0 & 0 & 0.194 & 0.194 & 0.512 +    [ tab:2-locus ]",

    "<S> this paper presents a non - parametric classification technique for identifying a candidate bi - allelic genetic marker set that best describes disease susceptibility in gene - gene interaction studies . </S>",
    "<S> the developed technique functions by creating a mapping between inferred haplotypes and case / control status . </S>",
    "<S> the technique cycles through all possible marker combination models generated from the available marker set where the best interaction model is determined from prediction accuracy and two auxiliary criteria including low - to - high order haplotype propagation capability and model parsimony . </S>",
    "<S> since variable - length haplotypes are created during the best model identification , the developed technique is referred to as a variable - length haplotype construction for gene - gene interaction ( varhap ) technique . </S>",
    "<S> varhap has been benchmarked against a multifactor dimensionality reduction ( mdr ) program and a haplotype interaction technique embedded in a famhap program in various two - locus interaction problems . </S>",
    "<S> the results reveal that varhap is suitable for all interaction situations with the presence of weak and strong linkage disequilibrium among genetic markers .    _ </S>",
