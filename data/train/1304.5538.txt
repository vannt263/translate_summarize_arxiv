    "in arc - shaped solar flares , huge amounts of electrons are accelerated due to magnetic reconnection . in the standard picture ( @xcite ) accelerated electrons are injected at the top of the loop - shaped flare , move down along magnetic field lines and , during their motion , loose energy because of various mechanisms .",
    "coulomb collisions with ambient particles represent the most relevant mechanism explaining energy losses for accelerated electrons in loop - shaped flares . in this framework ,",
    "the predominant energy loss process involves the interaction between the injected electrons and the electrons in the flaring target .",
    "specifically , under the assumption of a cold target , the energy loss rate formula depends as @xmath0 on the electron energy @xmath1 ( @xcite ) while in a warm target a more complicated formula accounts for the temperature @xmath2 of the ambient medium ( @xcite , @xcite ) . however , other important effects may impact on this process , such as wave - particles interactions ( @xcite , @xcite ) and return currents .",
    "this paper focuses on the role of return currents in the energy loss mechanism during flares and specifically utilizes measurements observed by the _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) _ to empirically study the mechanism of energy loss in the presence of return currents .    in their pioneering paper",
    ", @xcite analyzed the effect of return currents on accelerated electron motion by means of electrostatic fields and using vlasov equation .",
    "the combination of reverse current electrostatic field with collisions has been discussed in @xcite , where the impact of return currents on hard x - ray emission has been studied as well .",
    "bounds for the size of the electrostatic term due to unstable electron - ion drifts are found in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "another approach using electrostatic modeling is presented . the influence of inductive fields and their interplay with the electrostatic one have been thoroughly discussed and compared by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "starting form observations , @xcite argued that the areas of injection are considerably small and thus very large return currents are expected .",
    "more recently @xcite used rhessi observations to estimate the injection area , confirming the effects on hard x - ray emission predicted in @xcite .",
    "a complete treatment of the many possible kinetic energy loss mechanisms , including ohmic losses , has been more recently presented in @xcite .",
    "all previous papers are based on an ohmic viewpoint according to which the injection of a large number of accelerated electrons into the loop violates the local charge equilibrium and , in response to this violation , local currents are established by flare background electrons . in this picture , the generated return currents are driven by an electric field and energy losses of ohmic nature shorten the accelerated electron path before thermalization .",
    "however a different model describing the restoration of charge equilibrium is possible , in which the production of return currents occurs instantaneously , the background particles moves up coherently along the field line , while the energy loss rate due to coulomb collisions is modified in a very peculiar manner : since the single accelerated electron appears more energetic in the rest frame of the background motion and since the energy loss rate decays with energy , we expect the resulting coulomb collision energy loss rate to be lower than the one computed for background particles with vanishing drift velocity .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate the impact of this coherent background motion on the energy loss rate for accelerated electrons and to compare it with the competing influence of ohmic forces induced by return currents .",
    "this comparison will be performed by following the same empirical approach adopted by @xcite : we will ( 1 ) use hard x - ray imaging spectroscopy data observed by _ rhessi _ to reconstruct mean electron flux images of extended sources ( @xcite ) ; and ( 2 ) apply the electron continuity equation to select the model for energy loss rate that best fits the empirical electron maps .",
    "+ the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "in the next section we shall derive the energy loss rate for coulomb collisions when a coherent motion is added to the background maxwellian distribution . in the third section we shall describe the procedure we have adopted to compare the various energy loss rate models .",
    "the comparison of such models with _",
    "observations is presented in the fourth section and finally some conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "the main ingredients at the basis of our model are two formulas obtained by @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in the first one the differential cross section , which describes the probability of a single collision of a particle of charge @xmath3 and mass @xmath4 travelling with a speed @xmath5 against a target particle of mass @xmath6 and charge @xmath7 moving at velocity @xmath8 ,",
    "is @xmath9 this expression is non zero only for scattering angles @xmath10 bigger than a fixed small angle @xmath11 which is related to the debye screening length .",
    "the second formula describes the collisional loss rate for a particle traveling in a plasma , whose particle velocities are distributed as @xmath12 , and is given by @xmath13 here the coulomb logarithm @xmath14 is related to @xmath11 by @xmath15    in order to discuss the role of a coherent motion in the energy loss rate , we shall follow the derivation of ( [ dedt2 ] ) given by @xcite and modify the form of the target distribution .",
    "we shall here assume that the background particles are in a stationary solution of the boltzmann equation , i.e. that they are distributed according to the maxwell law but with a coherent motion induced by a drift velocity @xmath16 , and a thermal velocity @xmath17 such that @xmath18 , where @xmath2 is the temperature of the distribution and @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "under these hypotheses we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the target electron density . integrating over the target velocities and expressing the result in terms of @xmath22",
    "we get @xmath23 \\;,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where , @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the standard error function .",
    "it is possible to point out two terms in equation characterized by two different physical meanings .",
    "the first term corresponds to the pure thermal energy loss rate computed in a frame where the coherent velocity of the background vanishes ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the latter one is proportional to @xmath27 and can not be directly inferred from the pure thermal energy loss rate .",
    "equation ( [ questa ] ) can be simplified by assuming that @xmath16 and @xmath5 are anti - parallel and that the electron - electron collisions give the most important contribution to the energy loss .",
    "therefore , if @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , then @xmath31.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] when @xmath32 vanishes the previous expression reduces to the standard energy loss rate formula that can be found in @xcite . as previously noticed in the general case , also with the further assumption stated above , the energy loss rate is formed by two contributions .",
    "the one which can not be directly inferred from the thermal energy loss rate formula is relevant also in the zero temperature limit ( @xmath33 ) where we obtain @xmath34     kev for various background velocities @xmath32 . in the plot",
    "we have used as labels the kinetic energy @xmath35 associated to the corresponding drift velocity @xmath32 .",
    "the red line indicates the case when @xmath36 . ]",
    "figure [ fig : eloss - return - currents ] provides a qualitative analysis of the energy loss rate ( [ questa ] ) for different values of the kinetic energy @xmath35 associated to the drift velocity @xmath32 . from this analysis it clearly follows that , when the intensity of the background motion increases , the energy loss rate of the injected electrons decreases .",
    "further , all different forms of the energy loss rate for all different values of @xmath35 assume an asymptotic behavior @xmath0 at high electron energies .",
    "we now validate the model in equation with electron flux maps reconstructed from rhessi data , following the approach introduced by @xcite .    in the standard flare picture ,",
    "electrons move from the injection region towards foot - points along magnetic field lines , loosing energy along the paths .",
    "if @xmath37 ( electrons @xmath38 s@xmath39 kev@xmath39 ) is the electron flux , differential in energy along the direction s and @xmath40 is the column depth , @xcite proved that @xmath41 ( electrons @xmath42 s@xmath39 kev@xmath39 ) satisfies the continuity equation    @xmath43    where the first sign is positive for electrons moving towards larger @xmath44 and negative otherwise . in this equation",
    ", @xmath45 corresponds to the mean electron flux maps that can be reconstructed from _",
    "rhessi _ visibilities ( @xcite ) while @xmath46 is the source term coding the information on the injection region .",
    "the continuity equation can be interpreted to obtain @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an empirical quantity determined from the electron maps . in and -",
    "the source term @xmath46 describes the injection of electrons in the flare region and thus it is an energy gain term .",
    "following @xcite here we assume @xmath49 where @xmath50 ( electrons @xmath51 kev@xmath39 s@xmath39 ) is the source amplitude averaged along the line of sight , @xmath52 is the spectral index of the injected electrons , @xmath53 represents the length of the injected region and @xmath54 is fixed equal to 10 kev .",
    "since here we are interested in the energy domain , and since we shall average over different @xmath44 as in @xcite , the choice of a box shaped injection as in ( [ eqn : iniezione ] ) is not really restrictive .",
    "+ the total energy loss rate @xmath55 in represents the core of the present analysis . in the following",
    "we will consider four possible situations :    * * model 1 * : hot target with charge equilibrium .",
    "this is the case pictured by , in which the collisional target has a finite temperature and the background instantaneously reacts to the electron injection by means of a coherent motion .",
    "* * model 2 * : cold target with charge equilibrium .",
    "this is what happens when in one fixes @xmath56 .",
    "* * model 3 * : ohmic losses . in this case",
    "there is no drift velocity in the collisional term and the energy loss rate has the form @xmath57 where the second term on the r.h.s . describing the ohmic losses",
    "is given by @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the electric field which drives the return currents , @xmath60 is the resistivity , @xmath21 is the background density and @xmath32 is again the background velocity . the first term at the r.h.s .",
    "is the standard energy loss formula that can be found in @xcite , corresponding to the case when no background velocity is present and the target temperature is finite . *",
    "* model 4 * : hot target without return currents .",
    "this is the model described by @xcite and already discussed by @xcite .",
    "for all four models the number of free parameters to fit against the empirical @xmath61 is always two , and in all cases these parameters are the target density @xmath21 and the averaged source amplitude @xmath50 in . in fact , the target temperature can be fitted by using spatially integrated spectroscopy .",
    "this same spectroscopy and the charge equilibrium constraint allow fixing the drift velocity @xmath32 . more specifically , assuming that the injected electron flux @xmath62 is equal to the flux @xmath63 associated to the return currents leads to @xmath64 since the emission measure @xmath65 can be inferred from spectroscopy and the flare area @xmath66 from the reconstructed electron maps , equation represents a constraint for @xmath35 and therefore for @xmath32 .",
    "in this section , we present the results of the analysis stated above for various time bins of three different flares , namely those occurred on april 15 2002 , april 16 2002 and may 21 2004 .",
    "the time intervals , and the relevant physical parameters are described in the following table 1 .",
    "the temperature @xmath2 , the spectral index @xmath67 and @xmath65 are obtained from photon spectral fitting .",
    "the flare area @xmath66 is computed from the reconstructed electron maps . specifically , we used the map at 14 kev as reference image and summed up the areas of pixels with intensity higher than @xmath68 of the maximum intensity .",
    "the spatial region @xmath69 $ ] over which the average of @xmath61 is computed is determined as in @xcite ( see figure 4 of that paper ) .",
    "specifically , the electron flux images are considered for all energies and for each row of each image we took the pixel with maximum intensity .",
    "we thus drew a path in each image approximating a field line . in this path",
    "we fixed at @xmath70 the pixel with maximum intensity and assumed that moving toward the right foot - point increases @xmath44 while moving toward the left foot - point decreases @xmath44 .",
    "the values of @xmath50 and @xmath21 are determined as described in the previous section , i.e. by fitting the empirical @xmath61 values deduced from the mean electron flux spectral images and averaged along @xmath71 , against the four models of the energy loss rate .",
    "these best - fitted values for @xmath50 and @xmath21 in the three events under analysis are given in table 2 where we also provide the corresponding values of the kinetic energy associated to the return currents velocity .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig : rate - position ] contains the empirical values of @xmath72 used for the fitting and shows the best - fit curves corresponding to the four theoretical models .    from these results we notice first that for the april 16 2002 event ( in both considered time intervals ) , the @xmath73 values corresponding to the four models are very similar .",
    "correspondingly , the values of the kinetic energy @xmath35 associated to the drift velocity @xmath32 obtained for this event are considerably smaller than for the other two events .",
    "this is probably a consequence of the fact that this event in these time intervals is in a late phase ( coherently , the panels in figure [ fig : rate - position ] corresponding to this event show decreasing values for @xmath61 ) . for the other data sets , model 1 systematically provides smaller @xmath73 values . knowing the emission measure obtained from photon spectral fitting , and that @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the flare volume , we can validate the obtained density values . assuming that the flare has the shape of a tube",
    ", we can estimate @xmath75 for every time intervals starting from the electron flux maps as previously done for the area @xmath66 .",
    "we obtain that the emission measure obtained for model 1 has an order of magnitude in agreement with the emission measure obtained from photon spectral fitting . on the contrary ,",
    "the emission measure predicted by model 3 is two orders of magnitude lower .",
