    "this means that in a local conformal coordinate @xmath6 the length element of the metric is given by the formula @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a solution of the differential equation @xmath9 and @xmath10 , for the local coordinate @xmath6 which is equal to @xmath11 at @xmath5 . here",

    "alternatively , for every point in @xmath2 , there exists a local coordinate @xmath6 for which @xmath14 where @xmath15 . at the singular points @xmath5",
    "we have @xmath16 while at all other points , @xmath17 .    in 1890 , gttingen mathematical society proposed the study of equation ( [ 0 ] ) as a competition topic , probably by suggestion of h.a .",
    "schwarz @xcite .",
    "e.  picard wrote several papers on the subject , @xcite , see also ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "when @xmath18 , the topic is closely related to uniformization of orbifolds @xcite , where one is interested in the angles @xmath19 with positive integer @xmath20 .",
    "the case @xmath21 is quite well understood , but very little is known on the case @xmath22 .",
    "mcowen @xcite and troyanov @xcite studied the general question of existence and uniqueness of such metrics with prescribed @xmath5 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "troyanov also considered the case of non - constant curvature @xmath24 .",
    "one necessary condition that one has to impose on these data follows from the gauss  bonnet theorem : the quantity @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the euler characteristic .",
    "indeed , this quantity multiplied by @xmath27 is equal to the integral curvature of the smooth part of the surface .",
    "it follows from the results of picard , mcowen and troyanov , that for @xmath28 , condition ( [ curv ] ) is also sufficient for the existence of the metric with conic singularities at arbitrary points @xmath5 and angles @xmath13 .",
    "the metric with given @xmath5 and @xmath23 is unique when @xmath29 , and unique up to a constant multiple when @xmath30 .    in the case of positive curvature ,",
    "the results are much less complete .",
    "the result of troyanov that applies to @xmath31 is the following :    _ let @xmath2 be a compact riemann surface , @xmath3 points on @xmath2 , and @xmath32 positive numbers satisfying @xmath33 then there exists a conformal metric of positive curvature @xmath0 on @xmath2 with conic singularities at @xmath5 and angles @xmath13 .",
    "_    f.  luo and g.  tian @xcite proved that if the condition @xmath34 is satisfied , then ( [ troy ] ) is necessary and sufficient , and the metric with given @xmath5 and @xmath23 is unique .    in general ,",
    "the right hand side inequality in ( [ troy ] ) is not a necessary condition , and the metric may not be unique .    in this paper",
    ", we only consider the simplest case when @xmath2 is the sphere , so @xmath35 .",
    "the problem of description and classification of conformal metrics of curvature @xmath0 with conic singularities on the sphere has applications to the study of certain surfaces of constant mean curvature @xcite , and to several other questions of geometry and physics @xcite .",
    "the so - called `` real case '' is interesting and important .",
    "suppose that all singularities belong to a circle on the sphere @xmath2 , and we only consider the metrics which are symmetric with respect to this circle .",
    "then the circle splits @xmath2 into two symmetric disks .",
    "each of them is a _",
    "spherical polygon _ , ( surface )",
    "for which we state a formal definition :    [ n - gon]_a spherical @xmath36-gon _ is a closed disk with @xmath36 distinguished boundary points @xmath5 called the corners , equipped with a conformal riemannian metric of constant curvature @xmath0 everywhere except the corners , and such that the sides ( boundary arcs between the corners ) are geodesic .",
    "the metric has conic singularities at the corners .",
    "[ flat - n - gons ] let us consider _ flat _",
    "@xmath36-gons , which are defined similarly .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a flat @xmath36-gon with angles @xmath37 is given by the gauss  bonnet theorem which in this case says that @xmath38 and the polygon with given angles and prescribed corners is unique up to a scaling factor .",
    "the simplest proof of these facts is the schwarz ",
    "christoffel formula .",
    "thus our subject can be considered as a generalization of the schwarz ",
    "christoffel formula to the case of positive curvature .    in @xcite ,",
    "all possibilities for spherical triangles are completely described , see also @xcite where a minor error in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) was corrected . in the case of triangles ,",
    "the metric is uniquely determined by the angles when none of the @xmath23 is an integer .",
    "the case when all @xmath23 are integers , and @xmath36 is arbitrary , is also well understood . in this case , the line element of the metric has the global representation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a rational function .",
    "the singular points @xmath5 are the critical points of @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the multiplicity of the critical point @xmath5 , and @xmath23 is the local degree of @xmath40 at @xmath5 .",
    "thus the problem with all integer @xmath23 is equivalent to describing rational functions with prescribed critical points @xcite .",
    "almost nothing is known in the case when some of the @xmath23 are not integers , the number of singularities is greater than @xmath42 , and the right - hand side inequality in ( [ troy ] ) is violated .    in this paper",
    "we begin investigation of the case @xmath43 , with the emphasis on the real case .    in the real case",
    ", we may assume without loss of generality that the circle is the real line @xmath44 .",
    "the real line splits the sphere @xmath2 into two symmetric spherical @xmath36-gons with the real corners @xmath5 and the angles @xmath37 at the corners .",
    "thus we arrive at the problem of classification of spherical quadrilaterals ( surfaces ) .",
    "we study this problem using two different methods .",
    "one of them is the geometric method of f. klein @xcite who classified spherical triangles .",
    "klein classified not only spherical triangles with geodesic sides , but also circular triangles , whose sides have constant geodesic curvature ( that is , locally they are arcs of circles ) . a modern paper which uses klein s approach to triangles is @xcite .",
    "classification of triangles permitted klein to obtain exact relations for the numbers of zeros of hypergeometric functions on the intervals between the singular points on the real line .",
    "van vleck @xcite extended this approach of klein , using the same geometric method , and obtained exact inequalities for the numbers of zeros of hypergeometric functions in the upper and lower half - planes .",
    "hurwitz @xcite re - proved these results with a different , analytic method .",
    "we hope that our results can be used to obtain information about solutions of heun s equation , in the same way as klein obtained information about solutions of the hypergeometric equation .",
    "klein s classification of triangles was partially extended to arbitrary circular quadrilaterals ( not necessary geodesic ones ) in the work of schnflies @xcite and ihlenburg @xcite .",
    "they considered certain geometric reduction process of cutting a circular quadrilateral into simpler ones .",
    "then they classified the irreducible quadrilaterals up to conformal automorphisms of the sphere .",
    "thus they obtained an algorithm which permits to construct all circular quadrilaterals . using this algorithm , ihlenburg derived relations between the angles and sides of a circular quadrilateral .",
    "however this algorithm falls short of a complete classification .",
    "in particular , a quadrilateral with prescribed angles and sides is not unique .",
    "moreover , it seems difficult to single out geodesic quadrilaterals in the construction of schnflies and ihlenburg .",
    "we use somewhat different approach which consists in associating to every spherical geodesic quadrilateral a combinatorial object which we call a net , thus reducing the classification to combinatorics .",
    "then we solve this combinatorics problem and obtain a classification of spherical quadrilaterals up to isometry .",
    "our approach can be also applied to general ( non - geodesic ) circular quadrilaterals .",
    "the boundary of a spherical polygon is a closed curve on the sphere , consisting of geodesic pieces .",
    "the angles of such a curve at the corners make sense only modulo @xmath27 .",
    "all possible sequences of angles have been described by biswas @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "these inequalities on the angles give necessary but not sufficient conditions that the angles of a spherical polygon ( surface ) must satisfy .",
    "our second method is a direct study of heun s equation .",
    "classification of spherical quadrilaterals can be stated in terms of a special eigenvalue problem for this equation .",
    "this method leads to complete results when the eigenvalue problem can be solved algebraically .",
    "the contents of the paper is the following . in section [ de - connection ] , we recall the connection of the problem with heun s equation , and recall the results on heun s equation related to our problem . in section",
    "[ all - integers ] we describe what is known when all @xmath23 are integers , with a special emphasis on the `` real case '' when all @xmath5 belong to the real line .",
    "in section [ cases - leq-3 ] we begin the study of the case when two of the @xmath23 are integers and two others are not .",
    "( if three of the @xmath23 are integers then all four must be integers . )",
    "complete classification for this case is obtained in the remaining sections . sections [ cond - angles]-[counting - real ] are based on a direct study of the eigenvalue problem for heun s equation .",
    "the results are illustrated with numerical examples in section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "sections [ intro - to - part-2]-[chains ] are based on geometric and combinatorial methods .",
    "the cases when three or four of the @xmath23 are not integers are postponed to a forthcoming paper .",
    "let @xmath45 be the riemann sphere equipped with a metric with conic singularities .",
    "every smooth point of @xmath2 has a neighborhood which is isometric to a region on the standard unit sphere @xmath46 ; let @xmath40 be such an isometry",
    ". then @xmath40 has an analytic continuation along every path in @xmath47 , and we obtain a multi - valued function which is called the _ developing map_. the monodromy of @xmath40 consists of orientation - preserving isometries ( rotations ) of @xmath46 , so the schwarzian derivative @xmath48 is a single valued function .    developing map is completely characterized by the properties that it has an analytic continuation along any curve in @xmath49 , has asymptotics @xmath50 and has @xmath51 monodromy .",
    "it is possible that two such maps with the same @xmath5 and @xmath23 are related by post - composition with a fractional - linear transformation .",
    "the metrics arising from such maps will be called _",
    "equivalent_. following @xcite , we say that the metric is reducible if its monodromy group is commutative ( which is equivalent to all monodromy transformations having a common fixed point ) . in the case of irreducible metrics ,",
    "each equivalence class contains only one metric . for reducible metrics ,",
    "the equivalence class is a one - parameter family when the monodromy is non - trivial and a two - parameter - parametric family when monodromy is trivial .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath40 at the singular points @xmath5 implies that the only singularities of @xmath52 on the sphere are double poles , so @xmath52 is a rational function , and we obtain the schwarz differential equation ( [ schwarz ] ) for @xmath40 .",
    "it is well - known that the general solution of the schwarz differential equation is a ratio of two linearly independent solutions of the linear differential equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 for example one can take @xmath55 , then @xmath56 .",
    "another convenient choice is to make all poles but one of @xmath57 and @xmath58 simple . when @xmath59 , equation ( [ linear ] ) is equivalent to the hypergeometric equation , and when @xmath43 to heun s equation @xcite .",
    "the singular points @xmath5 of the metric are the singular points of the equation ( [ linear ] ) .",
    "these singular points are regular , and to each point correspond two exponents @xmath60 , so that @xmath61 . if @xmath23 is an integer for some @xmath62 , we have an additional condition of the absence of logarithms in the formal solution of ( [ linear ] ) near @xmath5 .",
    "it is easy to write down the general form of a fuchsian equation with prescribed singularities and prescribed exponents at the singularities . after a normalization ,",
    "@xmath63 parameters remain , the so - called accessory parameters . to obtain a conformal metric of curvature @xmath0 ,",
    "one has to choose these accessory parameters in such a way that the monodromy group of the equation is conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath64 .    by a fractional - linear change of the independent variable",
    ", one can place one singular point at @xmath65 .",
    "then , making changes of the variable @xmath66 , one can assume that the smaller exponent at each finite singular point is @xmath11 , see @xcite .",
    "for the case of four singularities @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , we thus obtain heun s equation in the standard form @xmath69 where @xmath70 here the exponents at the singular points are described by the riemann symbol @xmath71 the first line lists the singularities , the second the smaller exponents , and the third the larger exponents .",
    "so the angle at infinity is @xmath72 .",
    "the accessory parameter is @xmath73 .    solving the second equation ( [ cond ] ) together with @xmath74",
    ", we obtain @xmath75 and @xmath76 the question of the existence of a spherical quadrilateral with given corners @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath65 and given angles @xmath80 , is equivalent to the following : _ when one can choose real @xmath73 so that the monodromy group of heun s equation ( [ heun ] ) is conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath64 ? _    the necessary condition ( [ curv ] ) can be restated for the equation ( [ heun ] ) as @xmath81 we also have @xmath82 by a simple computation .",
    "one can write ( [ heun ] ) in several other forms . assuming that all @xmath5 are real",
    ", we have the sturm - liouville form : @xmath83 sometimes the schrdinger form is more convenient : @xmath84 where all four singularities are in the finite part of the plane .",
    "the exponents in the schrdinger form are @xmath85 the potential in ( [ schro ] ) is @xmath86 , where @xmath52 is the schwarzian ( [ schwarz ] ) .",
    "a question similar to our problem was investigated in @xcite : _ when can one choose the accessory parameter so that the monodromy group of heun s equation preserves a circle ? _ all these authors consider the problem under the assumption @xmath87 the most comprehensive treatment of this problem is in smirnov s thesis @xcite .",
    "smirnov proved that for all sets of data satisfying ( [ assumption ] ) , there exists a sequence of values of the accessory parameter @xmath88 such that the monodromy group of the equation has an invariant circle .",
    "each of the two opposite sides of the corresponding quadrilateral covers a circle @xmath89 times , and the other two sides are proper subsets of their corresponding circles .    the problem of choosing the accessory parameter so that the monodromy group is conjugate to a subgroup in @xmath64 is discussed in @xcite",
    "however all results of that paper are also proved only under the assumption ( [ assumption ] ) .",
    "assumption ( [ assumption ] ) seems to be essential for the methods of klein @xcite , hilb , smirnov and dorfmeister .",
    "if all @xmath23 are integers , the developing map @xmath40 is a rational function , and the metric of curvature @xmath0 with conic singularities can be globally described as the pull - back of the spherical metric via @xmath40 , that is @xmath90 the singular points @xmath5 of the metric are critical points of @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the multiplicities of these critical points .    the following results are known for this case .",
    "first of all , the sum of @xmath41 must be even : if @xmath91 is the degree of @xmath40 , then @xmath92 this is stronger than the general necessary condition ( [ curv ] ) .",
    "second , @xmath93 because a rational function of degree @xmath91 can not have a point where the local degree is greater than @xmath91 .",
    "subject to these two restrictions ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) , a rational function with prescribed critical points @xmath5 of multiplicities @xmath41 always exists @xcite .",
    "thus _ for any @xmath94 and any @xmath95 satisfying ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) there exist metrics of curvature @xmath0 on @xmath2 with angles @xmath13 at @xmath5 .",
    "_    two rational functions @xmath96 and @xmath97 are called _ equivalent _ if @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is a fractional - linear transformation .",
    "equivalent functions have the same critical points with the same multiplicities .",
    "equivalent functions generate equivalent metrics .",
    "the number of equivalence classes of rational functions with prescribed critical points and multiplicities is at most @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the _ kostka number _ which can be described as follows .",
    "consider young diagrams of shape @xmath102 consisting of two rows of length @xmath103 .",
    "a semi - standard young tableau ( ssyt ) is a filling of such a diagram with positive integers such that an integer @xmath104 appears @xmath105 times , the entries are strictly increasing in the columns and non - decreasing in the rows .",
    "the number of such ssyt s is the kostka number @xmath100 .    for a generic choice of the critical points @xmath5 ,",
    "the number of classes of rational functions is equal to the kostka number , see @xcite .",
    "suppose now that the points @xmath5 and the corresponding multiplicities @xmath23 are symmetric with respect to some circle .",
    "we may assume without loss of generality that this circle is the real line @xmath44 .",
    "it may happen that among the rational functions @xmath40 with these given critical points and multiplicities none is symmetric .",
    "so the resulting metrics are all asymmetric as well @xcite .",
    "however , there is a surprising result @xcite which was conjectured by b. and m. shapiro :    _ if all critical points of a rational function lie on a circle , then the function is equivalent to a function symmetric with respect to this circle .",
    "moreover , in this case there are exactly @xmath100 classes of rational functions with prescribed critical points of the multiplicities @xmath106 .",
    "_    it is interesting to find out which of these results can be extended to the general case of arbitrary positive @xmath23 .",
    "real rational functions with prescribed real critical points are classified by combinatorial objects which are called _",

    "we recall some known results for metrics with at most @xmath42 conic singularities .",
    "first of all , there is no metric on the sphere with one conic singularity .",
    "the case of two singularities is easy : the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the metric is that the angles at the singularities are equal , and the metric with prescribed angles is unique @xcite .    for the case of three singularities ,",
    "a complete description was obtained in @xcite :    _ if none of the @xmath23 is an integer , then the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the metric is @xmath108 which is equivalent to @xmath109 and the metric with prescribed angles is unique . _",
    "if @xmath110 is an integer , then the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a metric is that either @xmath111 or @xmath112 is an integer @xmath113 of the opposite parity to @xmath110 , and @xmath114 .",
    "all metrics with given angles are equivalent .",
    "[ rotation ] notice that for the case when all three @xmath23 are non - integers , the condition of existence of a spherical triangle with angles @xmath37 coincides with the condition on rotation angles of three elliptic transformations to be simultaneously conjugate to rotations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in the rest of the paper , we study the case @xmath43 with two integer @xmath23 .",
    "we answer the following questions :    \\a ) in the equation ( [ heun ] ) , for which @xmath23 one can choose @xmath73 so that the monodromy group is conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath64 ?",

    "\\c ) if , in addition , all @xmath5 are real , how many choices of real @xmath73 are possible ?    one can not have exactly one non - integer @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , in this case the developing map @xmath40 will have just one branching point on the sphere , which is impossible by the monodromy theorem .",
    "let us consider the case of two non - integer @xmath23 .",

    "then the developing map has an analytic continuation in @xmath120 from which we conclude that the monodromy group must be a cyclic group generated by a rotation @xmath121 , with some @xmath122 .",
