    "the nature of quantum entanglement attracted a great deal of attention even in the early days of quantum mechanics , yet it remained an unsolvable subject of philosophy until bell showed the possibility of practical experimental tests @xcite .",

    "all these tests confirmed quantum mechanical predictions .",
    "more recently , experimental and theoretical efforts are being shifted to  applications \" , such as quantum communications , quantum cryptography @xcite , and quantum teleportation @xcite , taking advantage of the peculiar physical properties of quantum entanglement .",
    "it is clear that preparation of maximally entangled two - particle ( two - photon ) entangled states , or bell states , is an important subject in modern experimental quantum optics .    by far",
    "the most efficient source of obtaining two - particle entanglement is spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) .",
    "spdc is a nonlinear optical process in which a higher - energy pump photon is converted into two lower - energy daughter photons , usually called the signal and the idler , inside a non - centrosymmetric crystal @xcite . in type - i spdc ,",
    "both daughter photons have the same polarizations but in type - ii spdc , the signal and the idler photons have orthogonal polarizations .",
    "the signal and the idler are generated into a non - factorizable entangled state .",
    "the photon pair is explicitly correlated in energy and momentum or equivalently in space and time . to prepare a maximally entangled two - photon polarization state , or a bell state",
    ", one has to make appropriate local operations on the spdc photon pairs .",
    "the polarization bell states , for photons , can be written as @xmath0 where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to two different photons , photon 1 and photon 2 , respectively , and they can be arbitrarily far apart from each other . @xmath1 and @xmath2 form the orthogonal basis for the polarization states of a photon , for example , it can be horizontal ( @xmath3 ) and vertical ( @xmath4 ) polarization state , as well as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",

    "[ intro ] , we discuss why one needs such a pulsed source of bell states , what happens when femtosecond pulsed laser is used to pump a type - ii spdc , and what has been done to recover the visibility in femtosecond pulse pumped type - ii spdc . in section [ type2theory ] ,",
    "we present a detailed theoretical description of how one can prepare a polarization bell state using femtosecond pulse pumped type - ii spdc without any post - selection , followed by the experiment in section [ type2exp ] .",

    "the quantum nature of spdc was first studied by klyshko in late 1960 s @xcite . zeldovich and klyshko predicted the strong quantum correlation between the photon pairs in spdc @xcite , which was first experimentally observed by burnham and weinberg @xcite .",

    "collinear type - ii spdc developed by shih and sergienko resolved this issue @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a common problem : the entangled photon pairs have 50% chances of leaving at the same output ports of the beamsplitter .",
    "therefore , the state prepared after the beamsplitter may not be considered as a bell state without amplitude post - selection as pointed out by de caro and garuccio @xcite .",

    "this non - collinear type - ii spdc method of preparing a bell state has been widely used in quantum optics community .",

    "therefore , in cw pumped spdc , there are readily available well - developed methods of preparing a bell state .",

    "this huge time uncertainty makes it difficult to use in some applications , such as generation of multi - photon entangled state , quantum teleportation , etc , as interactions between entangled photon pairs generated from different sources are required .",
    "this difficulty was thought to be solved by using a femtosecond pulse laser as a pump .",
    "unfortunately , femtosecond pulse pumped type - ii spdc shows poor quantum interference visibility due to the very different ( compared to the cw case ) behavior of the two - photon effective wave - function @xcite .",
    "one has to utilize special experimental schemes to maximize the overlap of the two - photon amplitudes .",
    "traditionally , the following methods were used to restore the quantum interference visibility in femtosecond pulse pumped type - ii spdc : ( i ) to use a thin nonlinear crystal ( @xmath7 m ) @xcite or ( ii ) to use narrow - band spectral filters in front of detectors @xcite .",
    "both methods , however , reduce the available flux of the entangled photon pair significantly and can not achieve complete overlap of the wave - functions in principle .",
    "we will discuss this in detail in section [ type2theory ] .",
    "branning _ et al _ first reported an interferometric technique to remove the intrinsic distinguishability in femtosecond pulse pumped type - ii spdc without using narrowband filters and a thin crystal @xcite .",

    "non - degenerate _ type - i spdc in the collinear scheme @xcite . also with collinear method , aligning the crystals is much easier and the visibility as high as 92% was easily obtained with 40 nm filters @xcite . although the collinear method and the mzi method look different , the theoretical description we have presented in the previous sections applies with no modifications .",
    "the theory described in section [ type1theory ] explains all the experimental results of ref.@xcite in detail and the experimental results shown in ref.@xcite can be explained by using the theory described in section [ type2theory ] by exchanging the polarization label with frequency label .",
    "we have shown that high - visibility quantum interference can be observed without using narrow - band filters for both type - ii and type - i spdc pumped by femtosecond laser pulses . in these methods ,",
    "a mach - zehnder interferometer is used to coherently add two biphoton amplitudes from two different nonlinear crystals pumped by coherent laser pulses . using this method ,",
    "maximally entangled two - photon polarization states , or bell states , can be successfully prepared .",
    "it is important to note that biphoton or two - photon amplitudes generated from coherent pump laser _ remain coherent _ even though they may originate from different spatial @xcite or temporal @xcite domains .",
    "as long as the distinguishing information present in the interfering amplitudes are erased , high - visibility quantum interference should be observed .",

    "two type - i crystals are placed collinearly in the pump beam path @xcite .",
    "although different geometry is used , the theory presented in section [ type1theory ] applies equally for both mach - zehnder interferometer and collinear case .",
    "for the two - crystal scheme using pulse pumped type - ii spdc , the envelope of the space - time interference pattern is determined only by the bandwidth of the pump pulse @xmath135 , as shown in section [ type2theory ] and section [ type2exp ] .",
    "crystal parameters do not affect the envelope of the interference pattern at all .",
    "on the other hand , for the two - crystal scheme using pulse pumped type - i spdc , the envelope of the interference pattern strongly depends on the crystal parameters , especially on @xmath109 and the crystal thickness @xmath23 as well as the pump bandwidth @xmath135 , as shown in section [ type1theory ] and section [ type1exp ] .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the envelope of the interference pattern does not have explicit dependence on @xmath132 .",
    "it is important to note the following . to observe the space - time interference , one can introduce the delay in two ways : ( i ) in @xmath60 or ( ii ) in @xmath61 . in the single - crystal spdc scheme , quantum interference",
    "is observed by introducing the delay @xmath70 in @xmath60 .",
    "but in two - crystal spdc scheme , one can introduce either in @xmath60 or in @xmath61 . in this paper",
    ", we have demonstrated high - visibility quantum interference in femtosecond pulse pumped spdc by introducing a delay @xmath77 in @xmath61 .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated bell states preparation schemes using femtosecond pulse pumped spdc . in type - ii spdc ,",
    "the envelope of the interference pattern is exactly equal to the envelope of the pump pulse convolution . on the other hand ,",
    "the envelope of interference pattern from type - i spdc is much broader than that of the pump interference",
    ". this may be useful if one needs to use femtosecond pulse pumped spdc , yet requires that two - photon amplitudes are distributed in time more than the pump pulse itself .",
    "type - i spdc has an advantage over type - ii spdc : two crystals can be easily used collinearly . as demonstrated in @xcite ,",
    "such a method will serve as a good source of entangled photon pairs for experiments which require accurate timing to overlap biphotons from different domains .",
