    "our starting point is the consideration of classic reversible cycles , such as that pertaining to the carnot engine or chemical engine , and their finite - time realizations which yield a finite power output .",
    "for the ( thermal ) carnot cycle this realization was studied by curzon and ahlborn @xcite , while for an isothermal cycle , converting chemical work to mechanical work , a particular finite - time realization was examined more recently by chen _ et al . _ @xcite . in both cases the efficiency at maximum power , relative to the ideal efficiency , was shown to be precisely 1/2 , in the limit of a small temperature difference ( for the thermal cycle ) or a small chemical potential difference ( for the isothermal chemical cycle ) between the two reservoirs that serve as heat and/or particle source and sink for the working fluid .",
    "this result was subsequently derived based upon general arguments for the thermal engine @xcite .",
    "moreover , the issue of efficiency at maximum power has since then been revisited in a number of papers for different thermodynamic cycles and models @xcite .    in this work we complement these previous studies .",
    "besides considering the finite - time realizations of the processes , necessary to obtain a non - zero power output , we also consider the _ finite - size versions of the particles _ constituting the working fluid , instead of the usual point - like ideal gas particles of zero size .",
    "this refinement is interesting for the chemical cycle , in which the transport coefficient involves the effusion and diffusion of the particles that make up the working fluid .",
    "in contrast , for the thermal cycle with heat exchange and particle conservation it is not relevant , since the transport coefficient in that case is the thermal conductivity of the engine wall , which is a solid - state property independent of the nature of the working fluid .",
    "the case of the thermal cycle is discussed in appendix a.    the objectives of this work are twofold .",
    "firstly , it introduces a concrete implementation of a chemical engine that cyclically converts chemical energy into mechanical work . during one cycle ,",
    "steps involving isothermal uptake / release of particles by the working fluid are alternated by isothermal expansion / compression steps .",
    "secondly , such a concrete model allows us to obtain explicit expressions for the transport coefficients used in the earlier derivations of the efficiency at maximal power of an isothermal chemical engine , as described , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "it becomes possible now to check whether or not those derivations are self - consistent , in the following sense . for calculating the efficiency at maximum power",
    ", the formal expressions for the power were extremalized with respect to chemical potential differences , while keeping the transport coefficients constant without explicit justification .",
    "in contrast , our present approach allows one to assess the validity of the classic calculations by inspecting whether the featured transport coefficients are indeed independent of the variables with respect to which differentiation is performed .",
    "finally , we mention that our chemical engine serves as a paradigm of the thermodynamics of chemical to mechanical energy conversion .",
    "during the chemical cycle an auxiliary system is brought in contact with different particle and/or thermal reservoirs . the cycle has four different phases as shown in figure  [ figuurcycle ] .",
    "the auxiliary system is a cylinder which is sealed on one end by a fixed wall and by a movable piston on the other end .",
    "the fixed wall has a valve that can be opened or closed , depending on the phase of the cycle .",
    "the working fluid consists of ( mono - atomic ) spherical particles of finite diameter @xmath7 , which interact solely via hard - sphere collisions .",
    "the clausius equation of state ( eos ) for such a fluid ( i.e. , the  mean - field \" or van der waals equation of state without inter - particle attractions @xcite ) is @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the pressure , @xmath10 the number of particles , @xmath11 the boltzmann constant and @xmath12 the temperature . the so - called free volume @xmath13 is the physical volume minus the co - volume or excluded volume .",
    "each particle excludes a volume @xmath14 to the centers of other particles , and hence @xmath15 is a low - density ( or one - dimensional @xcite ) approximation to the total excluded volume for the hard - sphere fluid . within this approximation",
    "the hard - sphere fluid is henceforth in short referred to as a _",
    "clausius gas_. we can rewrite the clausius eos in the form @xmath16 with @xmath17 the number density .    the clausius eos is exact for hard rods in one dimension ( for which @xmath18 ) , and can serve as a mean - field like approximation for hard particles ( disks or spheres ) in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "the chemical potential of the clausius gas contains an additional term relative to that of an ideal gas , due to the finite volume of the particles @xcite : @xmath19 with @xmath20 the thermal de broglie wavelength and where we assumed a three - dimensional space .",

    ", the change of energy @xmath22 of the auxiliary system has three contributions : @xmath23 with @xmath24 the heat absorbed by the gas , @xmath25 the mechanical work done on the gas due to the piston motion , and @xmath26 the chemical work input from the reservoir .",
    "+ @xmath27 phase i : particle uptake + initially , the cylinder containing the working gas has a volume @xmath28 in which @xmath10 particles are present .",
    "subsequently , the valve to the first particle reservoir ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) is opened and @xmath31 particles diffuse ( or effuse ) into the cylinder .",
    "the piston moves outwards and a final volume @xmath32 is reached . throughout the process , the density in the cylinder remains constant at @xmath33 .",
    "also the temperature is kept constant by virtue of a heat input from a thermal reservoir .",

    "the gas undergoes an isothermal expansion from volume @xmath32 to @xmath38 , while the density decreases from @xmath33 to @xmath39 .",
    "the systems remains at constant temperature owing to a net heat input .",
    "the mechanical work done on the gas is @xmath40 since the number of particles is fixed in this process , for which we coin the succinct term ",

    "the piston moves inwards until the volume @xmath43 is reached .",
    "the temperature , density @xmath39 and pressure @xmath44 are constant throughout the particle release . the mechanical work performed on the gas by the piston and the chemical work done on the gas are @xmath45 @xmath27 phase iv : isothermal compression + finally , the gas undergoes an isothermal and isocardinal compression from @xmath43 to @xmath28 .",
    "the valve is closed and the piston moves inwards to regain the initial state with volume @xmath28 and density @xmath33 .",
    "the chemical work is zero , while the mechanical work performed on the gas is @xmath46 the @xmath9-@xmath47 diagram of the process is shown in figure [ figuurpv ] .",
    "an overview of the thermodynamic quantities in the cycle is presented in table [ tabelrev ] .",
    "the heat exchange @xmath48 is obtained using the first law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the work ratio of the chemical cycle , called `` efficiency '' @xcite ( but for alternative definitions , see @xcite ) , is defined as @xmath49 where the sum is over all 4 phases . because the engine is isothermal and reversible , @xmath50 , where the subscript @xmath51 refers to the total over all 4 phases .",
    "the data in table [ tabelrev ] are in accord with this property .",
    "an application of the first law of thermodynamics then straightforwardly yields that the work ratio equals 1 .",
    "since these arguments are independent of the details of the engine , the work ratio equals 1 for all reversible isothermal cycles . for the sake of conformity with familiar nomenclature , we will henceforth also adopt the term  efficiency \" for @xmath52 .      during the particle uptake and release phases of the reversible cycle , the chemical potential of the working fluid is at all times equal to the chemical potential of the respective reservoirs .",
    "this implies that the particle transport is infinitely slow . in order to speed up the cycle , a drop in chemical potential ( or density ) between the reservoir and working fluid",
    "must be introduced .",
    "we make the following assumptions .",
    "we assume that the temperature is kept constant throughout . in order to allow the particles to leave the first reservoir and to enter the working gas",
    ", we assume a drop in chemical potential from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "the intake of particles takes place at constant chemical potential @xmath54 and therefore at constant density @xmath55 , compatible with the temperature @xmath12 and the value of the chemical potential @xmath56 , according to eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) .",
    "similarly , the release of particles in the third step of the cycle is assumed to take place at constant chemical potential @xmath57 and constant density @xmath58 , again related through eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) . in order to permit the flow of particles from the working gas into the second reservoir ,",
    "we assume a chemical potential drop from @xmath57 to @xmath59 .",
    "finally , without loss of generality , the number of particles transferred during the uptake and release phases remains equal to @xmath31 .",
    "and so the volumes are adapted during the different phases , e.g. , @xmath60 .",
    "we note that both chemical potential drops can be considered to occur outside the cycle .",
    "this is consistent with the application of the first law of thermodynamics to each phase of the cycle . in particular ,",
    "the thermodynamic quantities given in table [ tabelrev ] are _ all _ to be replaced by their counterparts in the irreversible cycle ( that is , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , with @xmath63 or @xmath64 ) .    the efficiency is now @xmath65 in accord with the result found in @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath66 , since only a fraction of the total available chemical work is done on the gas and converted to mechanical work done by the gas .",
    "more precisely , the amounts @xmath67 and @xmath68 of chemical work are `` wasted '' during uptake and release of the particles .",
    "the power output of the cycle is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the ( finite ) duration of the cycle .",
    "we now derive the efficiency at maximal power , in a way similar to the calculational scheme of curzon and ahlborn for the thermal cycle @xcite and that of chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for the chemical cycle .",
    "the dynamics of the cycle is not yet determined .",
    "when the two reservoirs are close to equilibrium , i.e. , the particle flux is well described by @xcite @xmath71 where the @xmath72 are essentially temperature - dependent transport coefficients . as we show in the next section , these coefficients do not depend , or depend only weakly , on the chemical potentials .",
    "note that @xmath73 @xmath74 during particle uptake ( release ) .",
    "the total time to complete phases i ( particle uptake ) and iii ( particle release ) is then @xmath75 in analogy with the curzon - ahlborn approach , the time required for the isocardinal phases ii and iv is set to @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a constant .",
    "consequently , the total time to complete a full cycle is simply @xmath78 .",
    "the power output of the cycle is @xmath79 given the values for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we now maximise the power with respect to @xmath82 and @xmath83 . this can be done analytically and yields : @xmath84 where we introduced the average chemical potential in the reservoirs : @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "note @xmath87 the resulting efficiency at maximum power is found to be @xmath88 which is exact within linear response theory .    since the linear transport law eq .",
    "( [ diffusion ] ) is strictly speaking only valid when the differences in chemical potential are small , the question arises how robust this number @xmath2 is against modifications of the transport law .",
    "the modifications we have in mind obviously include taking into account non - linearity and allowing for the presence of higher - order terms @xmath89 , with @xmath90 odd , but we also think of situations in which the thermodynamic variables are not the chemical potentials themselves but smooth functions of them . for example , when the linear dimension of the opening between working fluid and reservoir is smaller than the mean free path of the particles in the gas , transport occurs through effusion .",
    "the ( linear ) particle current is then naturally expressed as being proportional to the difference in densities @xcite : @xmath91 with @xmath92 the area of the opening and @xmath93 the mass of a single particle .",
    "further , if the working fluid and the reservoir are connected by a valve of opening cross - section @xmath92 and finite length @xmath94 , over which the density varies smoothly , the ( linear ) particle transport is limited by diffusion and described by fick s law , @xmath95 with @xmath96 the diffusion coefficient of the fluid , which depends on molecular constants , number density and temperature .",
    "this expression involving the density gradient can be rewritten in terms of the chemical potential gradient , using eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) , @xmath97 where the final expression is a low - density approximation .",
    "simple kinetic theory of gases implies that @xmath96 is proportional to the product of the thermal velocity @xmath98 and the mean free path @xmath99 of the molecules of mass @xmath93 , so that , for our clausius gas , @xmath100 consequently , the product @xmath101 depends mainly on molecular constants and temperature , and only weakly on density .",
    "we conclude that , in the low - density approximation , the transport coefficient @xmath102 in eq .",
    "( [ diffusion ] ) is given by @xmath103 with a proportionality constant of order unity .",
    "we observe that , for a dilute gas , @xmath102 depends only on temperature , molecular constants and the dimensions of the valve .",
    "consequently , for a dilute gas , it is justified to keep @xmath102 constant when considering variations of the chemical potential at constant temperature . for a left",
    "/ right symmetric cycle ( with input and output valves of equal size ) , @xmath104 .",
    "note that when the particle size @xmath7 is taken to zero , the point particles do not hinder each other during entry or escape and only effusion limits the current . whether or not diffusion can be neglected depends on the ratio of the volume of an  escape tube \" , @xmath105 , to the available volume per particle @xmath106 .",
    "if the former is much smaller than the latter , the tube is  free \" and the particle exchange between engine and reservoir is well described by effusion alone .",
    "conversely , transport is diffusion - limited when traffic in the tube is dense ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "we can capture the crossover between these two limits by writing down an effective transport coefficient @xmath108 where we neglected constants of order unity in the expression .    in order to encompass all such situations , and",
    "to retain full generality in the subsequent discussion , we propose the following generic transport law : @xmath109 the ( effective ) transport coefficients are now by definition independent of the chemical potential @xcite and the function @xmath110 is required to satisfy two conditions : i ) skew - symmetry , @xmath111 , and ii ) both first - order partial derivatives do not vanish at @xmath112 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ effu ] ) provides an example if the form of @xmath113 .",
    "also note that the second condition rules out certain purely nonlinear transport laws , which are interesting for us and therefore merit a separate discussion ( see further ) .",
    "the maximization of the power can no longer be done exactly , and we resort to a series expansion . since @xmath114",
    "we compose the following small parameter @xmath115 and define : @xmath116 the efficiency can then be expressed as : @xmath117 to proceed , we calculate @xmath118 and @xmath119 and then substitute the series expansions @xmath120 and @xmath121 . the coefficients are determined by the extremality conditions @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "this leads to the following results : @xmath124 and @xmath125 with @xmath126 and @xmath127 is a measure of the asymmetry between the flux constants @xmath128 and @xmath129 . substituting these results into the efficiency and again performing a series expansion in @xmath130 leads to    @xmath131    note that @xmath132 .",
    "interestingly , there are two circumstances under which the first - order correction to the universal constant vanishes . obviously , when the flux constants are equal , @xmath133 and hence @xmath134 , the first - order term vanishes .",
    "furthermore , all odd - order terms vanish .",
    "the intuitive explanation goes as follows . when @xmath133 the system is spatially symmetric so that simultaneously running the cycle backward and switching @xmath135 must lead to the same efficiency at maximum power",
    "this is called left / right symmetry .",
    "next , even when the engine is _ not _ left / right symmetric , the first - order correction vanishes when @xmath136 depends only on the difference @xmath137 , which covers a wide class of systems . in this case @xmath138 because for an antisymmetric function all even derivatives vanish at the origin .",
    "we verified analytically that , as a consequence hereof , all odd - order corrections vanish .",
    "the efficiency at maximum power now is , with @xmath139 , @xmath140 if , in addition , the system is left / right symmetric , we obtain @xmath141      in this section we test the robustness of eq .",
    "( [ effmp ] ) with respect to an exceptional modification of the transport equation . as a first example , we assume that there can exist circumstances under which the linear transport coefficient @xmath102 ( cf .",
    "( [ diffusion ] ) ) vanishes , while higher - order terms survive . for concreteness , we assume the following transport _ model _ @xmath142 the extremality conditions are again analytically soluble , and yield : @xmath143 with @xmath144 . note @xmath145 substitution in eq .",
    "( [ effratio ] ) leads to @xmath146 which is actually valid for all odd values of @xmath147 .",
    "specifically , for a purely cubic nonlinearity ( @xmath148 ) , we obtain @xmath149 hence the efficiency at maximal power is non - universal with respect to this exceptional modification of the transport law and decreases with increasing order of nonlinearity .    as a second example",
    ", we consider a generalization of the previous case and postulate the transport equation @xmath150 with sgn the sign function , which provides the antisymmetry in the variable @xmath151 .",
    "note that this model includes _ sublinear _ transport laws ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "in general the transport equation is singular ( except for integer and odd @xmath153 , which is the case considered in the first example ) .",
    "also for this more general model the efficiency at maximum power can be calculated exactly , following the foregoing steps without noteworthy modifications .",
    "the result is @xmath154 for sublinear transport laws this implies @xmath155 , and , remarkably , the maximum efficiency can tend to 1 when the transport law approaches a step function .",
    "one has to keep in mind , however , that to our knowledge it has not yet been shown that the modified transport laws proposed in this section are physically possible .",
    "we now analyse the previous finite - time cycle from the perspective of weak dissipation .",
    "this analysis is based on the framework introduced in @xcite , and goes as follows . during each step @xmath156 of the cycle , the change of energy @xmath22 of the auxiliary system has three contributions ( cf .",
    "( [ law1 ] ) ) , @xmath157 the entropy change @xmath158 can be written as @xmath159 with @xmath160 the entropy exchange with the environment and @xmath161 the internal , irreversible entropy production .",
    "since the auxiliary system returns to its initial state after one cycle we have @xmath162 .",
    "the output power and efficiency of the cycle are then , respectively , @xmath163 and @xmath164 in the general framework described in @xcite , it is argued that close to the reversible limit , the dissipation associated with the irreversible entropy production is inversely proportional to the operation times , @xmath165 maximising the power with respect to the operation times gives : @xmath166 and yields an efficiency at maximum power @xmath167 , irrespective of further details of the cycle .",
    "+ the work - to - work cycle presented above nicely fits into this framework . in order not to overburden the notation",
    ", we now set @xmath168 . in the first phase of the cycle an amount @xmath169",
    "is not used to do mechanical work , and a similar accident happens in phase iii .",
    "the corresponding internal irreversible entropy productions are @xmath170 and @xmath171 , since during those phases the entropy change is just the ( reversible ) heat exchange divided by @xmath12 . @xmath172",
    "this expression can be solved for @xmath82 to first order in @xmath173 , @xmath174 where we made use of the skew symmetry of @xmath110 .",
    "hence we find @xmath175 which is precisely the weak dissipation condition .",
    "a similar expression is obtained for @xmath176 .",
    "so once again we recover the universal value @xmath2 for the efficiency at maximum power .",
    "note that this derivation breaks down for the purely nonlinear transport model ( section ii.c ) , since @xmath177 vanishes identically for @xmath178 .",
    "in this paper we have achieved the following .",
    "+ i ) we have proposed a paradigm for the thermodynamics of energy conversion in the form of a concrete implementation of a chemical engine that cyclically converts chemical energy into mechanical work .",
    "+ ii ) we have complemented the finite - time ( and consequently finite - power ) analysis of a chemical cycle with a finite - size description of the particles constituting the working fluid .",
    "our treatment goes beyond the usual point - particle description , with which one can only discuss the uptake and release of particles as an effusion process .",
    "we have thus provided a minimal setting for invoking transport coefficients , such as the diffusion constant , which  of course  exist by virtue of the fact that the particles have a finite diameter .",
    "starting from the clausius equation of state we have given explicit expressions for the thermodynamic quantities characterizing the heat exchange , and chemical and mechanical work performed in the phases of the cycle .",
    "+ iii ) we have verified the validity and self - consistency of previous derivation(s ) of the efficiency at maximum power , by taking into account explicitly possible nonlinearities in the transport laws and possible density or chemical potential dependencies of the current in the transport equation .",
    "we have done this by proposing a transport model characterized by effective transport constants and an arbitrary skew - symmetric function of two variables , the chemical potentials of the two reservoirs .",
    "the precise form of this function is irrelevant , apart from the requirement that it produces a linear response to a small driving force .",
    "we conclude that the efficiency at maximum power takes the value 1/2 , predicted in earlier works based on selected models , .",
    "+ iv ) we have discussed the correction terms , in the form of powers of the chemical potential difference , to this universal constant .",
    "we have found that the first - order correction vanishes for chemical engines with left / right symmetry or chemical engines featuring processes for which the skew - symmetric function depends only on the chemical potential difference .",
    "+ v ) we have tested the robustness of the value 1/2 for the efficiency at maximum power , by modifying the transport law to one that produces a purely nonlinear response . to this end , we have introduced a model featuring an intrinsically nonlinear transport equation , and have found that the efficiency at maximum power depends in a simple algebraic manner on the exponent of the nonlinearity .",
    "physical systems that can be described by a vanishing linear transport coefficient have not been identified in this paper .",
    "we leave this as a challenge for further research @xcite .",
    "+ vi ) we have analyzed our chemical engine from the point of view of weak dissipation . in this limit full consistency with entropy production notions",
    "is found and the result 1/2 for the efficiency at maximum power emerges naturally ( for the generic transport law ) .",

    "on the subject of the thermal cycle ( without particle exchange ) between temperatures @xmath179 and @xmath180 we can be concise .",
    "firstly , it is readily checked that the carnot efficiency @xmath181 is , as it should , the same for a clausius gas and an ideal gas of point particles .",
    "it suffices to verify that , for the clausius gas , isothermal processes are described by @xmath182 , and adiabatic processes by @xmath183 or @xmath184 , with @xmath185 the familiar specific heat ratio and @xmath186 .",
    "given this preliminary check , it is straightforward to see that the derivation of curzon and ahlborn of the efficiency at maximum power @xmath187 is not influenced in any way by a modification of the intrinsic characteristics of the working fluid .",
    "indeed , the heat transfer coefficients in their derivation depend solely on the thickness @xmath94 and thermal conductivity @xmath188 of the ( solid ) wall of the vessel enclosing the working fluid .",
    "consequently , their main result @xmath189 is independent of the precise nature of the working fluid .",
