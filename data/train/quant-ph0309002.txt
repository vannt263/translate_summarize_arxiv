    "to implement universal computation in the quantum regime , one must be able to generate any unitary transformation on the logical qubit states . by",
    "now it has become part of the quantum computation folklore that the group @xmath4 of single - qubit operations and an entangling two - qubit operation such as the controlled - not ( @xmath3 ) can generate any unitary transformation exactly @xcite .",
    "furthermore it has been shown that there are _ discrete _ universal elementary gate - sets which approximate any unitary transformation with arbitrary precision efficiently qubits requires an exponential amount of elementary gates .",
    "our usage of _ efficient _ here means that given there is a sequence of one- and two - qubit gates that generates @xmath5 then we can approximate this @xmath5 to arbitrary accuracy with a sequence of gates drawn from our elementary set and such that we only have polynomial overhead in the number of gates used .",
    "further , to double the precision we only need a constant amount of additional gates .",
    "this is the notion we need to define efficient computation . ]",
    "( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "one such set is comprised of @xmath6 @xcite , where @xmath7 is the hadamard transform and @xmath8 is a phase gate , both acting on a single qubit . in this sense ,",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath3 comprise a quantum analogue to a classical _ universal logical gate - set_.    the traditional paradigm of quantum computation of `` one physical qubit = one logical qubit '' is often hard to implement because in the presently known menu of physical implementation schemes , it is usually difficult to control at least one of either the single - body or the two - body operations @xcite .",
    "a prime example is the heisenberg interaction ( with hamiltonian @xmath9 between spin particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the usual pauli matrices acting on qubit @xmath10 ) .",
    "it has many attractive features @xcite that have led to its being chosen as the fundamental two - qubit interaction in a large number of recent proposals : its functional form is very accurate  deviations from the isotropic form of the interaction , arising only from relativistic corrections , can be very small in suitably chosen systems .",
    "it is a strong interaction , so that it should permit very fast gate operation , well into the ghz range for several of the proposals . at the same time",
    ", it is very short ranged , arising from the spatial overlap of electronic wavefunctions , so that it should be possible to have an on - off ratio of many orders of magnitude .",
    "we will assume that the interaction can be switched on and off between coupled qubits @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the heisenberg interaction by itself is not a universal gate , in the sense that it can not generate any arbitrary unitary transformation on a collection of spin-1/2 qubits .",
    "so , every proposal has supplemented the heisenberg interaction with some other means of applying independent one - qubit gates ( which can be thought of as time - dependent local magnetic fields ) . but",
    "the need to add this capability to the device adds considerably to the complexity of the structures , by putting unprecedented demands on `` g - factor '' engineering of heterostructure materials @xcite , requiring that strong , inhomogeneous magnetic fields be applied , or involving microwave manipulations of the spins that may be slow and may cause heating of the device . these added complexities may well exact a high cost , perhaps degrading the quantum coherence and clock rate of these devices by several orders of magnitude .    _",
    "encoded universality _",
    "@xcite provides a way around this problem in some crucial cases , for example when the `` easy '' interaction is the exchange interaction , by entirely eliminating the need for single - body physical operations . by encoding each logical qubit in an array of multiple physical qubits , sequences of two - body nearest - neighbor exchange interactions",
    "are sufficient to generate the logical @xmath4 and @xmath3 operations on the encoded qubits @xcite and single - spin operations and all their attendant difficulties can be avoided .",
    "one drawback of the theory of encoded universality @xcite is that it establishes the sufficiency of certain two - body interactions for universality in a non - constructive way , not offering explicit methods with which to specify the sequences of physical implementable hamiltonians corresponding to the encoded logical gates .",
    "in particular it is not clear at the outset how many physical interactions are required to implement each of the logical gates in some layout of the qubits .",
    "encoded computation schemes are only viable if the number of physical interactions to be applied to the qubits is not too large , where the threshold is determined by currently achievable decoherence and switching times . in most cases ,",
    "numerical methods are the only way to find explicit sequences of hamiltonians for a set of universal gates for some realistic arrangement of the physical qubits .",
    "recently , more or less explicit universal logical gate - sets have been given for a three - qubit encoding using only the exchange interaction @xcite , for the @xmath14-interaction @xcite and for the generalized anisotropic exchange hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in @xcite an initial encoding of three physical qubits per logical qubit is used and a sequence of 19 hamiltonians is presented that implements the encoded @xmath3 .",
    "however this @xmath3 is given up to local unitary operations only , and the encoded single - qubit operations are given in terms of euler - angle rotations for the group @xmath4 .",
    "some further processing is needed to obtain a universal discrete gate - set , needed to implement quantum circuits _ in terms of the computational basis _",
    "@xcite .",
    "we present here a complete scheme for universal quantum computation on four - qubit encodings in a one- ( or two-)dimensional layout with nearest neighbor interactions only .",
    "we specify the encoding and layout and give all the gate switching times to obtain the encoded @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath3 in the computational basis without further post - processing .",
    "this scheme provides an immediately applicable building block for exchange - only quantum circuits .",
    "we also provide new gate sequences for the @xmath3 in the three - qubit encoding to higher precision and with different symmetries than in @xcite and provide the complete set of gates for the exact encoded @xmath3 in this smaller encoding .",
    "although the four - qubit encoding has a slightly larger overhead in spatial resources than the three - qubit encoding it offers several advantages .",
    "a quantum computation begins by setting all encoded qubits to the ( logical ) zero state . in our scheme",
    "this state is a tensor product of singlet states .",
    "this state is easily obtained using the exchange interaction : if a strong @xmath15 is turned on in each coded block and the temperature made lower than the strength @xmath16 of the interaction , these two spins will equilibrate to their ground state , which is the singlet state .",
    "unlike the smaller three - qubit encoding we do not require here any additional weak magnetic fields for initialization .",
    "this aspect renders the four - qubit encoding particularly attractive .",
    "another advantage is that the four - qubit scheme is conceptually simpler for use in quantum logic when the properties of robustness to noise are also taken into account .",
    "whereas the four - qubit logical states constitute a decoherence free subspace ( dfs ) under collective decoherence @xcite , the three - qubit logical states constitute a decoherence free subsystem in which the logical state evolution is defined by only one component of the tensor product space .",
    "a third advantage of the four - qubit encoding is that additional protection against single qubit errors can be achieved in this case by control of extra exchange interactions to form a supercoherent qubit @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , we describe the four - qubit encodings which define our logical space and give the physical layout of the qubits .",
    "we then specify the hamiltonians required to generate the single - qubit operations and the @xmath3 gate on the encoded qubits .",
    "the numerical methods used to obtain the exchange gate sequence for the encoded @xmath3 and further details are described in appendices [ app:1 ] and [ app:2 ] . the same numerical methods are used to obtain new high accuracy gate sequences for the exact @xmath3 in the three - qubit encoding .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of a solid - state implementation scheme in which these results can be readily applied , and some open problems meriting further consideration .",
    "we define the logical zero - state and one - state on one encoded qubit as @xmath17 where @xmath18 state .",
    "note that here the @xmath19 state is a tensor product of singlets @xmath20 .",
    "as detailed in the previous section this will be advantageous in many experimental settings since it will permit easy initializion of the logical qubits at the beginning of a computation .",
    "the arrays are spatially configured to permit serial nearest - neighbor exchanges between the physical qubits in a one - dimensional layout :    [ qubitlayout ]    ( 0,80 )    we could also imagine these qubit arrays in a two - dimensional layout , where several of the one - dimensional layers are stacked on top of each other .",
    "our construction of gate sequences will also hold for the two - dimensional setting .",
    "it suffices to note that the only difference is that along the layers of arrays the fourth qubit of each array is coupled to the first qubit of the next , whereas between layers the first qubit of one array in one layer is interacting with the first qubit of an array in the other .",
    "but note that both encoded states @xmath21 are symmetric with respect to swapping qubit @xmath22 with qubit @xmath23 and qubit @xmath24 with qubit @xmath0 , so we obtain exactly the same gate - sequence for @xmath3 for a coupling of the two first qubits of an array - all we need to do is to relabel the qubits on the bottom array as @xmath25 .",
    "the basis states of the logical space defined by two encoded qubits are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "our goal is to construct the single - qubit hadamard @xmath7 and @xmath8 gates , defined as @xmath30 on the encoded qubits , using a sequence of exchange interactions @xmath31 on adjacent pairs of physical qubits @xmath10 and @xmath32 .",
    "the matrices @xmath33 are the usual pauli matrices acting on the @xmath10th qubit and @xmath34 is the coupling constant .",
    "when we write @xmath35 we assume that the hamiltonian acts on the @xmath10th and @xmath32st qubit as specified and as the identity on all the other qubits . for convenience",
    "we are going to add a multiple of the identity to @xmath36 ( which just gives an unobservable global phase ) , and work with the rescaled interaction @xmath37 so that @xmath38 ( up to a global phase ) .",
    "we will give all exchange times in units of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "consider the effect of two particular exchanges on the logical states of a single encoded qubit .",
    "first , we note that in the code - subspace the action of the exchange @xmath40 is equal to that of @xmath41 , with both of these generating the transformation @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "so -@xmath40 is equivalent to a @xmath44 operation on a single logical qubit .",
    "therefore the hamiltonian for the encoded @xmath8 operation , up to an unobservable global phase , is exactly @xmath45 .",
    "next , consider the exchange @xmath46 .",
    "the action of this in the code - space is equivalent to @xmath47 .",
    "the effect of the @xmath48 operation on a single logical qubit is : @xmath49    by examining the effect of the @xmath40 and @xmath46 operations on the code - space , we can obtain an exact encoded hadamard operation as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the exact specifications of exchange operations for these single qubit gates are depicted in fig .",
    "2 .    [ onequbitoperations ]    ( 0,130 )",
    "to obtain the encoded @xmath3 we used numerical methods and proceeded in two stages . in the first step we attempted to obtain a gate @xmath53 that is _ equivalent _ to the encoded @xmath3 _ up to local unitary transformations _ on the encoded qubits .",
    "@xmath53 is _ locally equivalent _ to @xmath3 if there are single - qubit unitary operations @xmath54 ( acting on the first and second encoded qubit , respectively ) such that @xmath55 in the second stage we numerically obtained the local unitary operations @xmath54 to get from @xmath53 to the real @xmath3 in the computational basis and to obtain the gate - sequences of exchange interactions corresponding to each of these local operations @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "the reason for splitting the task into these two stages is the following .",
    "a result by makhlin @xcite shows that all locally equivalent gates are characterized by only three real parameters , @xmath58 ( a complex number ) and @xmath59 ( real ) , which we will refer to as the _ makhlin - invariants _ in what follows .",
    "appendix [ app:1 ] gives a brief summary of how @xmath58 and @xmath59 are calculated .",
    "for the @xmath3 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the reduction to three parameters greatly simplifies the numerical search and allowed us to obtain the gate sequences by a combination of genetic algorithms @xcite and nelder - mead simplex searches @xcite .",
    "the makhlin invariants give rise to a simple fitness function @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the complex norm .",
    "a gate sequence that generates a value @xmath64 is therefore equivalent to a @xmath3 .",
    "it is imperative for succesful quantum computation over a subspace that any permissible operation over the encoded qubits must act unitarily on linear combinations of these basis states and not `` leak '' any amplitude out of the subspace into its complement and vice versa .",
    "we will capture this requirement by defining a _ leakage parameter _ @xmath65 .",
    "then any permissible two - qubit physical operation @xmath66 must keep the code - subspace invariant , i.e. obey the following equation qubits keep the one - qubit code space invariant and do not leak .",
    "leakage can only occur when we couple two arrays ( see @xcite for details ) . ] : @xmath67 if leakage occurs @xmath68 .",
    "we note that any @xmath66 that is locally equivalent to @xmath3 or any other unitary logical operation over two encoded qubits must _ by definition _",
    "generate a leakage parameter of @xmath69 .",
    "however , we have found through numerical inspection that the search space in this problem is heavily pocked with local minima in which the makhlin invariants are close to the desired values for @xmath3 , but which `` leak '' out of the logical space by generating a @xmath65 value larger than @xmath70 . in our numerical searches",
    ", we overcame this problem by defining our fitness function as @xmath71 = f + @xmath65 , optimizing explicitly for not only a makhlin invariant match , but also for non - leakage .      for a gate @xmath53 , locally equivalent to the @xmath3",
    ", we found a gate sequence of @xmath72 nearest neighbor exchange interactions .",
    "figure 3 and table [ tab:4qbcnot ] show the layout and time parameters .            in the solution described in @xcite , the correlation symmetries were satisfied to machine precision , while the repetition symmetries satisfied exactly .",
    "we note that these correlation and repetition symmetries are not essential to the task of implementing the encoded @xmath3 operation . from an optimization perspective",
    ", they might even be interpreted as a hindrance that constrains the trajectory of numerical searches to lie in sub - optimal subspaces of the control parameter space .",
    "it is not clear whether the symmetries in the solution obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest the existence of analytical solutions to the optimization problem of the cost function , and if so whether these correspond to local or global minima .",
    "the above example shows that , without any symmetry restrictions and allowing the number of independent time parameters to increase , improvement to optimization of the cost function to within machine prevision can be obtained ."
