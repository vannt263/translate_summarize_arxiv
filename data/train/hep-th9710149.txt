    "if string theory is relevant to nature , it must possess a vacuum whose low energy effective field theory describes the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions .",
    "the question whether such a string vacuum exists is difficult to answer as the space of classical string vacua has a very large degeneracy , and there lack objective criteria that would select a particular string vacuum among the numerous possibilities .",
    "one might expect non - perturbative string dynamics to lift , partially or completely , this degeneracy in the moduli space . if this lifting is complete , then a thorough understanding of string dynamics may be sufficient to find a complete description of our universe .",
    "_ a priori _ , however , it is reasonable to suspect that non - perturbative dynamics may _ not _ select the unique vacuum , but rather pick out a number of consistent vacua , some in four dimensions with completely broken supersymmetry ; and our universe would be realized as one of the consistent vacua in this ( probably large ) set .",
    "if so , we would need to impose some additional , namely , phenomenological constraints to find the string vacuum in which we live .",
    "this approach has been known as `` superstring phenomenology '' .",
    "the latter must still be augmented with an understanding of non - perturbative dynamics as superstring is believed not to break supersymmetry perturbatively .",
    "it might seem , at least naively , that there is more than enough phenomenological data to identify the superstring vacuum corresponding to our universe .",
    "it is , however , not known how to fully embed the standard model into string theory with all of its complexity , so one is bound to try to incorporate only a few phenomenologically desirable features at a time ( such as , say , the gauge group , number of families , _ etc . _ ) . since such constraints are not very stringent , this ultimately leads to numerous possibilities for embedding the standard model in superstring that _ a priori _ seem reasonable @xcite .",
    "thus , to make progress in superstring phenomenology , one needs as restrictive phenomenological constraints as possible . it might be advantageous to impose such phenomenological constraints taking into account specifics of a partcular framework for superstring model building .    in the past decade , the main arena for model building within the context of superstring phenomenology has been perturbative heterotic superstring .",
    "the reason is that such model building is greatly facilitated by existence of relatively simple rules ( such as free - fermionic @xcite and orbifold @xcite constructions ) .",
    "moreover , many calculational tools ( such as , say , scattering amplitudes and rules for computing superpotentials @xcite ) are either readily available , or can be developed for certain cases of interest . despite enormous progress made in the past few years in understanding non - perturbative superstring vacua ,",
    "the state of the art there is still far from being competitive with perturbative heterotic superstring .",
    "the tools available in the latter framework must be first generalized to include the non - perturbative vacua before superstring phenomenology can step into this new terrain .    to be specific ,",
    "let us concentrate on perturbative heterotic superstring . within this framework",
    "the total rank of the gauge group ( for @xmath1 space - time supersymmetric models ) is 22 or less .",
    "after accommodating the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions ( with gauge group @xmath2 whose rank is 4 ) , the left - over rank for the hidden and/or horizontal gauge symmetry is 18 or less .",
    "the possible choices here are myriad @xcite and largely unexplored .",
    "the situation is similar for embedding unification within a _ semi - simple _",
    "@xcite gauge group @xmath3 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath4 ) .",
    "the state of affairs is quite different if one tries to embed grand unification within a _ simple _ gauge group @xmath3 .",
    "thus , an adjoint ( or some other appropriate higher dimensional ) higgs field must be present among the light degrees of freedom in effective field theory to break the grand unified gauge group @xmath5 down to that of the standard model . in perturbative heterotic superstring such states in the massless spectrum are compatible with @xmath1 supersymmetry and chiral fermions only if the grand unified gauge group is realized via a current algebra at level @xmath6 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref @xcite ) .",
    "this ultimately leads to reduction of total rank of the gauge group , and , therefore , to smaller room for hidden / horizontal symmetry , which greatly limits the number of possible models .",
    "the limited number of possibilities is not the only distinguishing feature of grand unified models in superstring theory .",
    "grand unified theories ( guts ) possess a number of properties not shared by superstring models with either the standard model or a semi - simple gauge group .",
    "one such property concerns the gauge coupling unification problem in superstring theory @xcite .",
    "thus , the strong and electroweak couplings @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 of @xmath10 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) unify at the gut scale @xmath11 @xcite at the value of @xmath12 .",
    "running of these couplings is schematically shown in fig.1a as a function of the energy scale @xmath13 .",
    "for comparative purposes , a dimensionless gravitational coupling @xmath14 is introduced , where @xmath15 is the newton s constant . in string theory",
    "the unification demands that all couplings meet at a single scale .",
    "note that the gravitational coupling becomes equal @xmath16 at a scale roughly two orders of magnitude higher than @xmath17 ( fig.1a ) .",
    "several possible approaches have been proposed to reconcile this apparent discrepancy @xcite , some of which are listed below : + @xmath18 the subgroups of @xmath10 unify into a single gut gauge group @xmath5 , and the gauge coupling of @xmath5 meets with @xmath19 as shown in fig.1b .",
    "+ @xmath18 the gauge group remains that of the mssm all the way up , but some extra ( compared with the mssm spectrum ) matter multiplets are present which change the running of the couplings so that their unification scale is pushed up to meet @xmath19 .",
    "such a scenario requires a judicious choice of the extra fields , as well as their masses @xcite .",
    "the situation is similar for the models with other semi - simple gauge groups .",
    "+ @xmath18 another possibility is suggested by @xmath20-theory @xcite , where the graviton can propagate in a 5-dimensional spacetime ( the bulk ) , while the gauge and matter fields live on 4-dimensional `` walls '' . below the energy scale of the order of the inverse `` thickness '' of the bulk",
    ", all fields propagate in 4 space - time dimensions @xcite . above this scale , however , the gauge and matter fields propagate in 4 dimensions , while the graviton propagates in 5 dimensions . as a result , @xmath19 runs faster and catches up with the strong and electroweak couplings as shown in fig.1c .",
    "the simplest way to obtain higher - level current algebras ( required for gut embeddings ) in perturbative heterotic superstring is via the following construction .",
    "start from a @xmath21-fold product @xmath22 of the grand unified gauge group @xmath5 ( of rank @xmath23 ) realized via a level-1 current algebra .",
    "the diagonal subgroup @xmath24 is then realized via level @xmath21 current algebra .",
    "( note that in carrying out this procedure the rank of the gauge group is reduced from @xmath25 to @xmath23 . )",
    "as far as the hilbert space is concerned , here we are identifying the states under the @xmath26 cyclic symmetry of the @xmath21-fold product @xmath22 .",
    "this is nothing but @xmath26 orbifold action , namely , modding out by the outer automorphism .",
    "an immediate implication of the above construction is a rather limited number of possibilities .",
    "for example , for a grand unified gauge group @xmath27 with , say , @xmath28 , the left - over rank ( for the hidden and/or horizontal gauge symmetry ) is at most 7 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this is to be compared with the left - over rank 18 in the case of the standard model embedding .",
    "taking into account that the number of models grows rapidly as a function of the left - over rank , it becomes clear that grand unified model building is much more restricted than other embeddings .",
    "since desired adjoint ( or higher dimensional ) higgs fields are allowed already at level @xmath30 , multiple attempts have been made in the past several years to construct level-2 grand unified string models .",
    "none of them , however , have yielded 3-family models .",
    "the first @xmath31 string gut realized via a level-2 current algebra was obtained by lewellen @xcite within the framework of free - fermionic construction @xcite .",
    "soon after schwartz @xcite obtained an @xmath32 level-2 string gut within the same framework . both of these models have four chiral families .",
    "multiple attempts have been made ever since to construct three - family string guts realized via level - two current algebras within free - fermionic construction @xcite and within the framework of symmetric @xcite as well as asymmetric @xcite abelian orbifolds @xcite . finally , three of us tried non - abelian orbifolds @xcite within both the free - fermionic and the bosonic formulations @xcite .",
    "there is no formal proof that 3-family models can not be obtained from level-2 constructions , but one can intuitively understand why attempts to find such models have failed . in the @xmath30 construction the orbifold group is @xmath33 .",
    "so the numbers of fixed points in the twisted sectors , which are related to the number of chiral families , are always even in this case .",
    "thus , it is natural to consider @xmath28 models .",
    "the orbifold action in this case is @xmath34 , and one might hope to obtain models with 3 families as the numbers of fixed points in the twisted sectors are some powers of 3 .",
    "the level-3 model building appears to be more involved than that for level-2 constructions .",
    "the latter are facilitated by existence of the @xmath35 heterotic superstring in 10 dimensions which explicitly possesses a @xmath33 outer automorphism symmetry of the two @xmath36 s . constructing a level-2 model then",
    "can be carried out in two steps : first one embeds the grand unified gauge group @xmath5 in each of the @xmath36 s , and then performs the outer automorphism @xmath33 twist .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath30 construction , @xmath28 model building requires explicitly realizing @xmath34 outer automorphism symmetry which is not present in 10 dimensions .",
    "the implication of the above discussion is that one needs relatively simple rules to facilitate model building .",
    "such rules have been derived @xcite within the framework of _ asymmetric orbifolds _ @xcite .    with the appropriate model building tools available",
    ", it became possible to construct @xcite and classify @xcite 3-family grand unified string models within the framework of asymmetric orbifolds in perturbative heterotic string theory .",
    "here we briefly discuss the results of this classification .",
    "( a detailed survey of three - family grand unified string models is given in section ii . ) for each model we list here , there are additional models connected to it via classically flat directions @xcite : + @xmath18 one @xmath37 model with 5 left - handed and 2 right - handed families , and asymptotically free @xmath38 hidden sector with 1 `` flavor '' .",

    "+ @xmath18 three @xmath40 models : + ( _ i _ ) the first model has 6 left - handed and 3 right - handed families , and asymptotically free @xmath41 hidden sector with 3 `` flavors '' . + ( _ ii _ ) the second model has 3 left - handed and no right - handed families , and asymptotically free @xmath42 hidden sector with matter content consisting of doublets of each @xmath38 subgroup as well as bi - fundamentals .",
    "+ ( _ iii _ ) the third model has 3 left - handed and no right - handed families , and asymptotically free @xmath43 hidden sector with 3 `` flavors '' .",
    "( this model has not been explicitly given in ref @xcite , and will be presented in appendix [ models ] . )",
    "+ @xmath18 finally , there are some additional @xmath32 models which do not seem to be phenomenologically appealing ( see section [ gut ] for details ) .",
    "all of the above models share some common phenomenological features .",
    "thus , there is only one adjoint and no other higher dimensional higgs fields in all of these models .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath31 models ( and other related models ) do _ not _ possess anomalous @xmath44 .",
    "all three @xmath40 models listed above _ do _ have anomalous @xmath44 ( which in string theory is broken via the green - schwarz mechanism @xcite ) .",
    "the above models all possess non - abelian hidden sector .",
    "there , however , exist models where the hidden sector is completely broken .    to study phenomenological properties of these models it is first necessary to deduce their tree - level superpotentials",
    ". this turns out to be a rather non - trivial task as it involves understanding scattering in asymmetric orbifolds .",
    "there , however , are certain simplifying circumstances here due to the fact that asymmetric orbifold models possess enhanced discrete and continuous gauge symmetries . making use of these symmetries ,",
    "the tools for computing tree - level superpotentials for a class of asymmetric orbifold models ( which includes the models of interest for us here ) have been developed in ref @xcite .",
    "the perturbative superpotentials for some of the three - family grand unified string models were computed in ref @xcite .",
    "we compute perturbative superpotentials for other relevant models in this paper following the rules of ref @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of tree - level superpotentials allows one to analyze certain phenomenological issues such as proton stability ( doublet - triplet splitting and @xmath0-parity violating terms ) and yukawa mass matrices .",
    "the question of supersymmetry breaking can also be addressed by augmenting the tree - level superpotentials with non - perturbative contributions which are under control in @xmath1 supersymmetric field theories @xcite .",
    "thus , in ref @xcite doublet - triplet splitting problem and yukawa mass matrices were studied for the @xmath31 models .",
    "it was found that certain degree of fine - tuning is required to solve the doublet - triplet splitting problem , suppress dangerous @xmath0-parity violating terms and achieve realistic yukawa mass matrices .",
    "all @xmath32 models suffer from the severe fine - tuning problem steming from the doublet - triplet splitting as there are no `` exotic '' higher dimensional higgs fields among the light degrees of freedom .",
    "the latter are required by all known field theory solutions to the problem .    in this paper",
    "we study similar issues for the @xmath40 models .",
    "the results of our analysis indicate that the doublet - triplet splitting does not seem to be as big of a problem for the @xmath40 models as it is for their @xmath31 and @xmath32 counterparts . however , the troubles with @xmath0-parity violating terms and yukawa mass matrices still persist for these models .    in this paper",
    "we also analyze the possible patterns of supersymmetry breaking in the three - family grand unified string models .",
    "we find that the supersymmetry breaking scale in these models comes out either too high to explain the electroweak hierarchy problem , or below the electroweak scale unless some degree of fine - tuning is involved .",
    "since none of the three - family grand unified string models constructed to date appear to be phenomenologically flawless , one naturally wonders whether there may exist ( even within perturbative heterotic superstring vacua ) other such models with improved phenomenological characteristics .",
    "thus , all _ a priori _ possible free - field embeddings of higher - level current algebras within perturbative heterotic superstring framework have been classified @xcite . this , however , does not guarantee that any given embedding can be incorporated in a consistent string model , and even if this is indeed possible , there need not exist three - family models within such an embeding .",
    "the three - family grand unified string models descussed in this review are concrete realizations of the _ diagonal _ level-3 embedding @xmath45 .",
    "however , even if our models do exhaust all three - family grand unified string models within free - field realized perturbative heterotic superstring , there may exist non - free - field grand unified string models with three families .",
    "tools for constructing such models are not available at this moment , so that for years to come the asymmetric orbifold models we discuss in this review might be the only ones available .",
    "regardless of their phenomenological viability they provide the _ proof of existence _ for three - family grand unified string models ; these models could also serve as a stringy paradigm for such model building in general , and also give insight to the `` bottom - up '' approach .",
    "this review is organized as follows . in section [ survey ]",
    "we give a detailed survey of three - family grand unified string models classified in refs @xcite . in section [ hidden ]",
    "we discuss supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking in these models .",
    "in section [ gut ] we discuss some aspects of susy gut phenomenology in these models . in section [ conc ]",

    "all the details are relegated to appendices .",
    "in this section we give a systematic survey of all the ( relevant ) three - family grand unified string models .",
    "this survey is organized by the grand unified gauge group , number of generations and anti - generations , and hidden sector gauge group and matter .",
    "we will not list all the models ( as most of them can be either found in refs @xcite , or deduced from those listed there ) , but give only the models that are representative of classes of models with similar features , or stand by their own ( for they possess special features ) .",
    "some of the latter models , namely , with @xmath40 grand unified gauge group , have not been presented elsewhere , so we briefly outline their construction in appendix [ models ] .",
    "there is one @xmath37 model ( referred to as the @xmath46 or @xmath47 model in ref @xcite ; @xmath46 and @xmath47 stand for two different ways of constructing the same model @xcite ) . it has @xmath48 left - handed and @xmath49 right - handed families , and @xmath50 hidden sector with @xmath49 chiral doublets ( corresponding to one  flavor \" ) .",
    "the massless spectrum of the @xmath37 model is summarized in table i.    the @xmath37 model is a special ( enhanced gauge symmetry ) point in a certain moduli space , which we will refer to as @xmath51 , that also contains other three - family models with grand unified gauge groups @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "all of these models are connected to each other ( and to the @xmath37 model ) via a web of ( classically ) flat directions .",
    "they all have @xmath48 left - handed and @xmath49 right - handed families , and @xmath50 hidden sector .",
    "there are two features that distinguish them : the hidden sector matter content ( number of  flavors \" of @xmath50 ) and the horizontal gauge symmetry .",
    "these two features are not completely uncorrelated .",
    "thus , breaking the horizontal symmetry ( via higgsing ) sometimes leads to some of the hidden sector doublets acquiring mass ( via tree - level superpotential ) . on the other hand",
    ", sometimes hidden sector doublets can get heavy without breaking the horizontal symmetry , _ i.e. _ , via coupling to gauge singlets ( present in some models ) acquiring vevs . depending on the number of hidden sector doublets , the @xmath50 group may or may not be asymptotically free . here",
    "we are interested only in models with asymptotically free hidden sector ( for the phenomenological reasons discussed earlier ) . if the number of hidden sector  flavors \" is too large in a given model so that @xmath50 is not asymptotically free , it can always be connected to another model with smaller matter content of @xmath50 such that the latter is asymptotically free . thus , we can confine our attention to the models with asymptotically free @xmath50 without loss of generality .",
    "the moduli space @xmath51 is multiply connected , _",
    "i.e. _ , it has different branches .",
    "thus , there are points where more than one branch meet , yet these branches have no other intersection points .",
    "some of the branches lead to models with no hidden sector .",
    "we will not consider them here .",
    "let us summarize the possibilities for the @xmath50 matter content .",

    "( there is also one @xmath32 model with five  flavors \" @xcite ; this model exists only at a special point in the moduli space , and generically , the number of  flavors \" is one on the branch where it lives because the other four become heavy via a coupling to a gauge singlet whose vev is a flat direction .",
    "the model with one  flavor \" is the @xmath53 model given in table iv ; see subsection d of this section and subsection 4 of appendix [ models ] for details . )",
    "the @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath40 models with one  flavor \" can be obtained from the @xmath37 model by adjoint breaking ( the vev of the adjoint is a flat direction ) .",

    "the models with three  flavors \" are connected to the models with one  flavor \" via points with enhanced horizontal gauge symmetry where the branches with three  flavors \" and one  flavor \" intersect .",
    "we note that the generation and anti - generation structure of the models with different numbers of the @xmath50  flavors \" is the same .",
    "in particular , the couplings involving the corresponding ( grand unified ) matter fields are similar .",
    "thus , to study the susy gut phenomenological aspects of these models it suffices to consider the models with one @xmath50  flavor \" . the conclusions generically hold for all the other models .",

    "similarly , @xmath95 and @xmath96 live in the same moduli space as the @xmath90 model . the massless spectra of these models are given in table viii and table ix .",

    "( also note that the @xmath95 and @xmath96 models have 3  flavors \" of @xmath50 at the enhanced symmetry point . )",
    "the appearance of @xmath98 s of @xmath40 is amusing as they have been considered in certain scenarios where the doublet - triplet splitting is achieved via the pseudo - goldstone mechanism @xcite .",
    "that is , electroweak higgs doublets arise as pseudo - goldstones in breaking @xmath40 grand unified gauge symmetry down to that of the standard model .",
    "these doublets then do not couple to matter that easily ( to produce , say , top yukawa coupling ) unless some special arrangements are made .",
    "one of the solutions proposed in the literature @xcite involves ( an odd number of ) @xmath98 s of @xmath40 ( so that they do not pair up and get dirac mass ) .",
    "however , in the models @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 the @xmath98 s ( whose number is even ) are vector - like and are massless only at the special point ( of enhanced horizontal gauge symmetry ) in the moduli space discussed above .",
    "generically they are heavy and thus decouple from the massless sector .",
    "we will , therefore , regard the @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 as some special points in the respective moduli spaces of models @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and consider only the latter for phenomenological purposes .",
    "as we already mentioned , there are various @xmath32 models most of which are connected ( via flat directions ) to the @xmath37 , @xmath31 and @xmath40 models discussed above , and some of which are isolated points @xcite .",

    "we note that the @xmath31 and @xmath40 models _ a priori _ do not look as hopeless ( from the doublet - triplet splitting point of view ) as the @xmath32 models , and this is why we investigate them in more detail .",

    "we will also show in section [ hidden ] that the hidden sector in the @xmath65 model does not get strong at desired energy scale .",
    "the @xmath40 models that we need to consider are @xmath70 , @xmath80 , @xmath83 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 . we will also point out some of the phenomenological problems in the @xmath101 model . finally , as we explained before , we need not consider the @xmath37 model separately .    here",
    "we would like to emphasize one feature that is common to all of the three - family grand unified models : they have one adjoint but no higher dimensional higgs fields in their massless spectra .",
    "in this section we discuss some issues relevant for strong coupling dynamics in the hidden sector .",
    "the latter is important for possible supersymmetry breaking and stabilization of moduli .",
    "although the current state of the art in this subject does not always allow one to carry out detailed quantitative analysis , in models with relatively simple hidden sectors ( and all of the models we are studying in this paper are of this type ) it is oftentimes possible to see whether supersymmetry is broken at all , and to estimate the scale of supersymmetry breaking . if in a given model this scale comes out too high compared with the electroweak scale @xmath102 , then it is difficult to imagine how the electroweak gauge hierarchy would be explained in such a model without fine - tuning . on the other hand",
    ", if this scale comes out way below @xmath103 , then supersymmetry breaking in such a model is not compatible with experiment .",
    "thus , consider a hidden sector with a simple gauge group @xmath104 and some matter content ( some number of  flavors \" ) with the @xmath69-function coefficient @xmath105 at the string scale @xmath106 . in some cases there",
    "could be a scale @xmath107 below the string scale at which some of the matter charged under @xmath104 becomes heavy and decouples .",
    "such a scale , for instance , could be an anomalous @xmath108 breaking scale , and if some of the matter couples ( say , via three - point yukawa couplings ) to singlets ( charged under @xmath108 ) that acquire vevs to break @xmath108 , then it could develop dirac mass . let the @xmath69-function coefficient below the scale @xmath107 be @xmath109 .",
    "let @xmath110 , so that the hidden sector is asymptotically free below the scale @xmath107 . above the scale @xmath107 it may ( in which case @xmath111 ) or may not ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath112 be asymptotically free .",
    "it is simple to see that the gauge coupling of @xmath104 blows up at the scale @xmath113 given by @xmath114 here @xmath115 is the gauge coupling of @xmath104 at the string scale .",
    "note that in all of our models the hidden sector gauge group is realized via a level-1 current algebra , while the grand unified gauge group is realized via a level-3 current algebra .",
    "thus , the relation between the gauge couplings of @xmath104 and the observable sector ( let the latter gauge coupling be @xmath116 ) at the string scale is given by @xmath117 .",
    "also note that if any of these models were to match the experimental data , we would ultimately have to assume that @xmath118 , where @xmath12 is the unification coupling obtained by extrapolating the lep data with the assumption of minimal matter content and superpartner thresholds at @xmath119 .",

    "next , we turn to the supersymmetry breaking in the models we are studying . in appendix [ susybr ]",
    "we provide all the necessary details , so our discussion here will be brief .    first consider the @xmath101 model .",
    "its hidden sector is @xmath41 with no matter .",
    "there is a possibility that local supersymmetry is broken dynamically if suitable non - perturbative corrections are present in the khler potential @xcite , but the question remains open since computing these corrections is out of reach of our present technology . in any case , even if supersymmetry was broken dynamically in the hidden sector of the @xmath101 model , it would be transmitted ( via the standard supergravity mediated scenario @xcite ) to the observable sector at a scale much higher than the one favored by phenomenology ( see appendix [ susybr ] ) .",
    "another case we need to consider is @xmath129 with @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the number of  flavors \" . within the framework of global supersymmetry , this case",
    "is known to have no quantum vacuum as the meson fields ( which are quark bi - linears ) have a runaway behavior .",
    "that is , the there is a non - perturbative superpotential such that the meson @xmath132-terms ( as well as the superpotential itself ) are non - vanishing at any finite values of the meson vevs .",
    "once we incorporate this theory within the local supergravity framework , however , the tree - level khler potential is enough to stabilize the meson vev @xcite , and local supersymmetry is broken .",
    "all the details can be found in appendix [ susybr ] .",
    "there we also give the corresponding supersymmetry breaking scales for the models @xmath80 ( @xmath41 with two `` flavors '' ) , @xmath63 , @xmath70 and @xmath100 ( @xmath38 with one `` flavor '' ) , and @xmath101 ( @xmath43 with one `` flavor '' ) .",
    "we find that the supersymmetry breaking scales in the models @xmath80 and @xmath101 come out too high compared with @xmath103 , whereas for the models @xmath63 , @xmath70 and @xmath100 they come out way below @xmath103 unless it is assumed that the supersymmetry breaking messenger scale is @xmath133 . in these models obtaining such low scales for the messenger @xmath44",
    "s seems to require some fine - tuning .",
    "we are left with only one model to consider , namely , the @xmath83 model .",
    "below the anomalous @xmath44 breaking scale this model has the following matter ( chiral supermultiplets ) in the hidden sector ( the hidden sector gauge group is @xmath42 ) : @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( @xmath137 stands for the fundamental , _",
    "i.e. _ , doublet , of @xmath38 ) with different dynamically generated scales @xmath138 and @xmath139 for the two @xmath38 s , and the tree - level superpotential . in appendix [ s2 ] we investigate the non - perturbative dynamics in this model .",
    "we show that there is no dynamically generated superpotential , and the quantum moduli space is the same as the classical one , unless one of the @xmath38 subgroups is completely higgsed . in the latter case",
    "we simply flow into the @xmath100 model ( which has @xmath38 with one `` flavor '' in its hidden sector ) , which we already discussed above .      thus , the analysis in appendix [ susybr ] seems to indicate that none of the models at hand are flawless as far as supersymmetry breaking is concerned . to make more definitive conclusions about phenomenological viability of these models , in the subsequent sections we will discuss issues that should be resolved at tree - level once the non - perturbative dynamics is assumed to work in favor of the models we are studying .",
    "if we can find some unsatisfactory features even at this level , then phenomenological viability of the models will most certainly be ( at least ) difficult to render .",
    "in this section we address the following three susy gut phenomenological issues of the models we are studying : ( _ i _ ) doublet - triplet splitting , ( _ ii _ ) @xmath0-parity violating terms , and ( _ iii _ ) yukawa mass matrices .",
    "the first two issues are related to proton stability . in the third one",
    "we will confine our attention to figuring out if one can naturally get one of the three up - quarks to be heavy ( top - like ) while having the other two light .",
    "we note that all of these questions in a phenomenologically viable model should be resolved at the level of perturbative superpotential .",
    "thus , we will assume that the non - perturbative dynamics in the hidden sector discussed in the previous section works out in favor of phenomenological viability of these models .",
    "then we can see whether the three aspects mentioned above can work out without some unnatural fine - tuning of vevs , which in this approach are free parameters .      in ref @xcite we studied the @xmath63 model in detail .",
    "let us first summarize the important features of this model ( see table ii for details ) .",
    "there is one adjoint higgs field ( @xmath140 ) , 5 generations ( @xmath141 s ) , 2 antigenerations ( @xmath142 s ) , 7 higgs fields ( @xmath143 s ) , and various singlets of @xmath31 grand unified gauge group .",
    "note that these fields descend from the adjoint higgs field ( @xmath58 ) , 5 generations ( @xmath59 s ) , 2 antigenerations ( @xmath60 s ) , and singlets of @xmath37 in the @xmath37 model .",
    "( recall the branching @xmath144 under the breaking @xmath145 .",
    "note that @xmath146 .",
    "the @xmath147 fields from the adjoint of @xmath37 are missing in the @xmath31 model as they are eaten in the super - higgs mechanism upon breaking @xmath37 down to @xmath72 . )",
    "we note that due to the @xmath132-flatness conditions in the superpotential of the @xmath63 model ( derived in @xcite ) one of the @xmath143 s does not couple to any of the other fields and can be dropped out of the analysis .",
    "thus , we have only 6 @xmath143 s to consider . for the same reason of @xmath132-flatness conditions , only one @xmath148 pair becomes heavy at the gut scale . in particular",
    ", this implies that another @xmath148 can only become heavy at a much lower scale ( of the order of @xmath149 due to relaxation of the @xmath132-flatness conditions ) .",
    "thus , we have 4 @xmath141 s and 1 @xmath142 to consider below the gut scale .",
    "next , let us consider the possible scenarios for breaking @xmath31 down to @xmath10 .",
    "there is only one adjoint higgs field in the massless spectrum of the model .",
    "the adjoint must break @xmath31 down to its subgroup that contains @xmath10 .",
    "this implies that the adjoint @xmath150 must acquire a vev in the following direction : @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is a @xmath153 antisymmetric matrix .",
    "now , let us discuss the higgs sector ( @xmath143 s ) .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath154 , @xmath155 , to refer to these higgs fields .",
    "the mass matrices for the fields ( _ i.e. _ , higgs doublets and triplets ) coming from @xmath154 have the following form : @xmath156 . here",
    "@xmath157 are symmetric couplings ( coming from the couplings of @xmath154 to singlets ) , whereas @xmath158 are antisymmetric couplings ( coming from the couplings of @xmath154 to singlets and the adjoint ) .",
    "the latter couplings are antisymmetric since the adjoint @xmath140 of @xmath31 is antisymmetric . in ref @xcite",
    "we showed that generically all six pairs of doublets and triplets coming from @xmath154 are heavy due to the above couplings . to have a pair of light doublets one",
    "then needs one fine - tuning ( of vevs that determine the above couplings ) .",
    "suppose now we have one pair of light doublets and all the other fields coming from @xmath154 are heavy ( in doing this we have to impose one fine - tuning , but let us do this as we are trying to make another point ) .",
    "there are terms in the superpotential that have the following form : @xmath159 . here",
    "@xmath160 , @xmath161 , are the five generations .",
    "note that in order to break @xmath31 all the way down to @xmath10 , one @xmath148 pair has to acquire a vev ( along with the adjoint ) .",
    "this pair is a linear combination of the five generations and two antigenerations .",
    "thus , once this pair has a non - zero vev we ultimately get mixing between the fields in @xmath154 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the higgs sector , and @xmath160 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the matter sector . here",
    "one should be careful as _ a priori _ the mixing could be between states that become heavy and decouple .",
    "thus , what one really needs to check is if there is mixing between the light pair of doublets from @xmath154 and the three light generations that would have to correspond to the three families of quarks and leptons below the @xmath149 scale .",
    "generically , such a mixing is present , and to avoid it one fine - tuning is required .",
    "the reason why the above mixing should be avoided is the following : it generically generates @xmath0-parity violating terms which would lead to too rapid proton decay . thus to avoid these @xmath0-parity violating terms",
    "we need another fine - tuning as described above .",
    "note that the @xmath0-parity violating terms in this case are  vev induced \" , _",
    "i.e. _ , they appear after certain fields acquire vevs .",
    "the reason is that there is no clear separation between the matter sector and the higgs sector in this model at the string scale , _",
    "i.e. _ , no well defined @xmath0-parity .",
    "this turns out to be a generic feature of all of the models we are studying .",
    "finally , we would like to address the issue of yukawa mass matrices .",
    "suppose we take the pair of light higgs doublets coming from @xmath154 ( this requires one fine - tuning ) and impose the requirement that the @xmath0-parity violating terms be absent ( this requires another fine - tuning ) .",
    "then we may ask a question of what the yukawa coupling matrix of these higgs fields to the three generations looks like . in ref @xcite we showed that generically this @xmath162 yukawa ( mass ) matrix has rank 3 , and , therefore",
    ", two additional fine - tunings are required to get rank 1 _ i.e. _ to have only one heavy ( top - like ) quark with electric charge @xmath163 .",
    "in conclusion we see that ( according to the analysis of ref @xcite ) the @xmath63 , and all the other three - family @xmath31 grand unified string models of ref @xcite , do not meet the above three phenomenological requirements at tree - level . to achieve desired phenomenological features they generically require multiple fine - tunings .",
    "the only chance for them to arise is via some very contrived non - perturbative dynamics ( which by some  string miracle \" would have to fix all the vevs at their fine - tuned values ) .",
    "this seems unnatural and improbable .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss some of the issues in @xmath40 susy gut phenomenology . in appendix [ gut6 ]",
    "the reader can find more details of our analysis for particular models we are considering here .",
    "as far as the doublet - triplet splitting is concerned , there is a crucial difference between @xmath31 and @xmath40 guts .",
    "it can be easily understood from the following point of view . in @xmath31 guts quarks and leptons",
    "come from @xmath141 irreps , while doublet and triplet higgses come from @xmath143 irreps .",
    "note that @xmath143 of @xmath31 does _ not _ contain singlets of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , they can not participate in breaking the @xmath31 grand unified gauge group down to that of the standard model . in our models , therefore , the only fields that can take part in reducing @xmath31 to @xmath10 are the @xmath140 and a @xmath164 pair . then the doublets and triplets from the @xmath143 s generically couple to these fields in much the same way , and one needs fine - tuning of vevs ( as we discussed in the previous subsection ) to achieve doublet - triplet splitting .    in @xmath40 guts the situations",
    "is quite different .",
    "each  generation \" arises from one @xmath85 and a pair of @xmath165 s .",
    "there are some states within these irreps that are extra compared with the standard model quarks and leptons .",
    "they can play the role of higgs doublets and triplets . in this case , however , the adjoint must acquire vev in the direction that breaks the @xmath40 to @xmath4 .",
    "this can be easily seen from examining the quantum numbers of the states in @xmath85 and @xmath165 s in terms of @xmath10 .",
    "the situation here is the same as in @xmath32 guts , and doublet - triplet splitting can not be achieved without fine - tuning .",
    "( this is true taking into account that in our models there are no  exotic \" massless higher - dimensional higgs fields . )",
    "there is an alternative scenario , namely , to have extra @xmath166 pairs .",
    "then higgs doublets and triplets could come from these additional fields .",
    "naturally , the extra states in @xmath85 and @xmath165 s must become heavy which can be achieved by having yukawa couplings of the type @xmath167 and giving vev to a @xmath166 .",
    "this is allowed since these states do contain a singlet of @xmath10 .",
    "note that in this case the adjoint ( @xmath168 ) of @xmath40 must acquire vev in a direction different from the one that breaks @xmath40 to @xmath4 ( or else a @xmath169 pair would have to acquire vev to break @xmath4 further down to @xmath10 , which is not possible since a @xmath166 pair already has acquired a vev ) .",
    "there are two possibilities here for the adjoint breaking : @xmath170 and @xmath171 . in the first case",
    "@xmath166 vev breaks @xmath172 to @xmath173 , whereas in the second case @xmath174 is broken to @xmath175 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that doublet and triplet higgses in these scenarios are not treated on the equal footing , and , therefore , doublet - triplet splitting may be achieved without fine - tuning @xcite .",
    "one of the conclusions we can immediately draw from the above discussion is that the minimal three - family @xmath40 model , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath101 model , does not seem to be phenomenologically viable , and we will not consider it any further .",
    "although the doublet - triplet splitting problem can be relatively easily solved in @xmath40 guts , there are some additional difficulties .",
    "the most pressing of those is generating the top - quark mass .",
    "note that to generate masses for up - quarks in general ( assuming that massless @xmath98 s of @xmath40 are absent ) , one needs couplings of the form @xmath176 .",
    "here one of the @xmath177 s acquires vev at a high scale ( @xmath178 ) , whereas the other one contains the electroweak doublet responsible for generating the up - quark masses .",
    "the form of the polynomial function @xmath179 depends upon details of the scenario . in any case , if couplings of this type are absent in a given model , it can be rendered phenomenologically inviable . in appendix [ supsu(6 ) ] we give superpotentilas for the @xmath40 models @xmath70 , @xmath80 , @xmath83 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 . from these superpotentials",
    "one can see that the @xmath70 , @xmath80 , and @xmath99 models do possess the above type of couplings , and we will investigate them further . the models @xmath83 and @xmath100 , however , lack such couplings altogether , and are , therefore , phenomenologically inviable .",
    "we will not discuss them any further .",
    "thus , we are left with the @xmath70 , @xmath80 and @xmath99 models to consider .",
    "first , we would like to address the issue of yukawa mass matrices .",
    "the @xmath70 and @xmath99 models are very similar .",
    "in particular , the terms relevant for generating yukawa mass matrices are of the same form . in appendix [ gut6 ]",
    "we present the details , so here we simply state the results : there are two top - like quark generations in these models , and unlike , say , the @xmath63 model , even fine - tuning does not seem to help in obtaining rank-1 up - quark yukawa mass matrix .",
    "note that since in the @xmath70 and @xmath99 models there is no well - defined @xmath0-parity at the string scale ( _ i.e. _ , the higgs sector is not clearly separated from the matter sector ) , there will generically be @xmath0-parity violating terms once a @xmath166 pair acquires vev .",
    "these terms come from the yukawa couplings @xmath180 .",
    "some degree of fine - tuning will be needed to suppress these @xmath0-parity violating terms .    finally , we comment on the @xmath80 model without going into any detail .",
    "the problems with yukawa mass matrices and vev - induced @xmath0-parity violating terms that we have encountered in the @xmath63 , @xmath70 and @xmath99 models are present in the @xmath80 model as well .",
    "( in this model , however , it appears to be possible to get rank-1 up - quark yukawa mass matrix in the leading approximation at the cost of fine - tuning . )",
    "this can be verified by analyzing the superpotential for this model given in appendix [ supsu(6 ) ] .      in this section",
    "we saw that fine - tuning seems to be required to achieve doublet - triplet splitting in the three - family @xmath31 grand unified string models we are considering . in our @xmath40 models the doublet - triplet splitting problem can be solved via mechanisms already developed in the field theory context @xcite .",
    "all of the models seem to require fine - tuning to suppress vev generated @xmath0-parity violating terms . in some of the models it is possible to obtain rank-1 up - quark mass matrix ( in the leading order ) at the cost of fine - tuning , whereas in other models even this seems to be problematic .",
    "none of the three - family grand unified string models considered in this review agree with phenomenology unless some fine - tuning is involved .",
    "the possibility of such fine - tuning is due to the presence of moduli , or flat directions , in the classical supersymmetric vacuum .",
    "these flat directions could be lifted after dynamical susy breaking .",
    "then such fine - tuning could _ a priori _ arise via some very contrived non - perturbative dynamics ( which by some `` string miracle '' would have to fix all the vevs at their fine - tuned values ) .",
    "the latter possibility seems unlikely taking into account that multiple vevs have to be fine - tuned ( in _ a priori _ uncorrelated fashion ) .",
    "here we would like to make a comparison between the field theory and string guts .",
    "naively , one might expect a `` string miracle '' ( such as a stringy discrete symmetry ) that could solve some of the problems present in field theory guts .",
    "this , however , does not seem to be the case in the three - family grand unified string models considered in this review .",
    "thus , the doublet - triplet splitting problem in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 string models was not any less severe than in their field theory counterparts . on the contrary ,",
    "absence of `` exotic '' higher dimensional higgs fields in the massless spectrum has led us to the conclusion that the doublet - triplet splitting would require unnatural fine - tuning in these models . on the other hand , the doublet - triplet splitting problem in the @xmath40 string models would have to be achieved via the already well - known field theory mechanism @xcite . even in this case",
    "the field theory approach turns out to have an advantage : the successful solution of the doublet - triplet splitting problem does _ not _ guarantee proton stability as @xmath0-parity violating terms might still mediate too  rapid proton decay . within field theory",
    "one can simply require @xmath0-parity violating terms to be absent already at the string scale .",
    "however , in our models there is no well - defined @xmath0-parity : there is simply no clear separation between the matter and higgs sectors at the string scale .",
    "this leads to `` vev induced '' @xmath0-parity violating terms .",
    "such @xmath0-parity violating terms are a common feature for all of our models , and could be present even in more generic classes of models ( which are not necessarily string guts ) .    finally , we would like to comment on one of the `` original motivations '' to consider string guts .",
    "as discussed in introduction , in string guts the gauge and gravitational coupling unification is automatic .",
    "here one subtlety arises . in order to have agreement with the experimental data ( such as @xmath181 )",
    ", one must assume that there are _ not _ too many extra light states ( compared with the mssm spectrum ) below the gut scale . such states ( if in incomplete @xmath32 multiplets ) generally tend to raise the unification scale ( for the fixed @xmath181 prediction ) at one loop order , and sometimes could also spoil the unification of couplings .",
    "if they are too light , then the gut scale can rise beyond the string scale which would not be compatible with the phenomenological data .",
    "perhaps , some of the most troublesome of such light states are those in the adjoint of @xmath10 .",

    "in this section we discuss supersymmetry breaking in the models @xmath63 , @xmath70 , @xmath80 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "let us be general here and consider @xmath129 hidden sector with @xmath130 `` flavors '' .",
    "the non - perturbative superpotential for this theory is given by @xcite : @xmath185 here @xmath186 are the meson fields ( @xmath187 and @xmath188 are the fundamental quarks and anti - quarks ) , and @xmath189 is the dynamically generated scale .",
    "this superpotential has a `` runaway '' behavior .",
    "that is , for any finite values of the meson vevs @xmath190 , the @xmath132-flatness conditions can not be simultaneously satisfied and the superpotential does not vanish .",
    "this implies local supersymmetry breaking due to khler potential contributions @xcite .",
    "intuitively this can be understood by noting that once such a theory is coupled to supergravity there is a natural shut - down scale for all the runaway directions , namely , the plank scale .",
    "generically , this results in local supersymmetry breakdown .",
    "the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath149 in the observable sector is given by @xmath191 here @xmath192 is the messenger scale , and @xmath132 is the supersymmetry breaking @xmath132-term .",

    "this gives @xmath201 this formula is in fact also correct for @xmath202 . in this case",
    "we have gaugino condensate @xmath203 .",
    "then the standard gravity mediated @xcite scenario predicts the following supersymmetry breaking scale in the observable sector : @xmath204      since there is no matter in the @xmath82 hidden sector in this model , supersymmetry breaking would have to occur via gaugino condensation . in our case of @xmath82 with no matter we have @xmath205 , and",
    "according to eq ( [ m_h ] ) we have @xmath206 . then from eq ( [ gauginocond ] ) the scale @xmath207 .",
    "this is too high to be compatible with electroweak gauge hierarchy .",
    "the tree - level superpotential relevant for the hidden sector dynamics in this model reads ( see appendix [ supsu(6 ) ] for details and table v for notation ) : @xmath208 note that @xmath209 are chiral triplets of @xmath82 , whereas @xmath210 are chiral anti - triplets .",
    "@xmath211 s are @xmath82 singlets charged under various @xmath44 s of the model .",
    "thus , the mass matrix @xmath212 ( @xmath213 ) reads : @xmath214 next , we have the following @xmath132-flatness conditions : @xmath215 from this we conclude that generically one of the `` flavors '' of @xmath82 is heavy with the mass of the order of @xmath216 .",
    "therefore , below the anomalous @xmath44 breaking scale @xmath107 we can treat the hidden sector as @xmath82 with two `` flavors '' . for the @xmath80 model",
    "( @xmath217 and @xmath218 ) @xmath149 then comes out way too low .",
    "note that if we assume that all four vevs @xmath219 are zero , then supersymmetry is not broken at all .",
    "the hidden sector gauge group and matter content are the same for the models @xmath63 , @xmath70 and @xmath100 . here",
    "we have @xmath50 with one `` flavor '' . using eq ( [ susybr ] )",
    "one can easily verify that the scale @xmath149 also comes out way too low .",
    "the massless spectrum of this model is given in table viii .",
    "following the rules for computing superpotentials given in ref @xcite , one can easily deduce the tree - level superpotential relevant for hidden sector dynamics : @xmath220 here @xmath221 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 . note that the first @xmath44 is anomalous ( with total trace anomaly equal @xmath224 ) , so that the field @xmath225 acquires vev to break it .",
    "thus , the fields @xmath226 get mass of the order of the anomalous @xmath44 breaking scale @xmath107 , and there is only one `` flavor '' ( namely , @xmath227 and @xmath228 ) below this scale . the supersymmetry breaking scale in this model can be estimated to be @xmath229 , which is too high .      in section",
    "[ survey ] we pointed out that there are models connected to the @xmath37 model ( and , therefore , also to the models @xmath63 and @xmath70 ) with @xmath50 hidden sector with numbers of flavors @xmath230 . in general , for @xmath129 with @xmath231 non - perturbative superpotential is not generated , and supersymmetry is not broken .",
    "so to break supersymmetry in these models all but one of the `` flavors '' ( there are no models with two `` flavors '' ) would have to acquire masses .",
    "then we are back to the @xmath63 and @xmath70 models .",
    "as we see , in none of the above models does the supersymmetry breaking scale come out right .",
    "it is either too high ( as in the @xmath99 and @xmath101 models ) , or way too low ( as in the models @xmath80 , @xmath63 , @xmath70 and @xmath100 ) . in the latter models one could try to replace @xmath232 by @xmath107 ( which could be , say , anomalous @xmath44 breaking scale ) and argue that all the runaway vevs are stabilized at @xmath107 , and also that the mediation of supersymmetry breaking is due to a messenger ( different from gravity ) whose scale @xmath192 is lower than @xmath232 ( and is , perhaps , related to @xmath107 ) .",
    "this does not really help since ( as can readily be verified from eq ( [ susybr ] ) ) the main suppression comes from the exponential factor @xmath233 , unless @xmath192 is taken to be rather low , namely , @xmath234 .",
    "the latter possibility seems to be very unlikely since it is unclear what would generate such a low scale for messenger @xmath44 s in the models @xmath80 , @xmath63 , @xmath70 and @xmath100 , unless some fine - tuning is involved .",
    "( note that the messengers in these models could be either gravity or @xmath44 s , and the natural scale for the latter is @xmath232 in the models @xmath63 , @xmath70 and @xmath100 , and @xmath232 or the anomalous @xmath44 breaking scale @xmath107 in the @xmath80 model . ) to avoid such a large suppression , one could try to decrease the number of flavors @xmath131 , which _ a priori _ is not impossible if one involves higher dimensional operators ( such as , say , @xmath235 and @xmath236 couplings in the @xmath37 superpotential given in appendix [ supe_6 ] ) .",
    "a more careful examination of the corresponding superpotentials , however , reveals that in the @xmath31 models this would require giving @xmath143 s of @xmath31 large vevs which would break the standard model gauge group at a high scale . in the @xmath40 models one would ultimately have to turn on large vevs for @xmath85 s of @xmath40 .",
    "this necessarily leads to breaking @xmath40 via @xmath4 , and doublet - triplet splitting then can not be achieved without fine - tuning ( see section [ gut ] and appendix [ gut6 ] for details ) .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that the models at hand do not seem to give rise to realistic supersymmetry breaking patterns .",
    "in this section we study the hidden sector dynamics in the @xmath83 model .",
    "the tree - level superpotential relevant for the hidden sector dynamics in this model reads ( see appendix [ supsu(6 ) ] for details and table v for notation ) : @xmath237    note that the third @xmath44 in this model is anomalous . in order to break the anomalous @xmath44",
    ", the field @xmath225 must acquire a vev .",
    "let the corresponding scale be @xmath107 .",
    "then the doublets @xmath238 and @xmath239 of the second @xmath38 subgroup decouple at this scale . at the end ( _ i.e. _ , below the scale @xmath107 )",
    "we are left with the @xmath42 hidden sector with the following matter content : @xmath134 ( from @xmath240 ) , @xmath135 ( from @xmath241 ) , and @xmath136 ( from @xmath242 ) . here",
    "@xmath137 stands for the fundamental , _",
