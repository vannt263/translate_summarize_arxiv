    "in stellar evolution calculations the core helium burning ( cheb ) phase is subject to considerable uncertainty .",
    "the fundamental reason for this is that the amount of helium fuel that is brought into the convective core where it can burn , and hence the phase lifetime , is critically dependent on the treatment of convective boundaries .",
    "historically , star counts in galactic globular clusters have been the most important empirical test for the efficiency of mixing in cheb stars .",
    "more recently , asteroseismology has provided complementary constraints on the structure and evolution of cheb stars . in this study",
    "we test insights gleaned from recent asteroseismology studies , particularly those in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter paper  i ) , against the wealth of high - quality photometry of globular clusters now available .      in low - mass cheb models with convective overshoot ,",
    "the position of the boundary of the convective core is volatile .",
    "this is because carbon and oxygen , the products of helium burning , are more opaque than helium , so if any of the material is mixed across the formal convective boundary it tends to increase the opacity enough in the adjacent zone to make it unstable to convection according to the schwarzschild criterion . in such models ,",
    "the feedback from this process generally precipitates the development of a large region with slow mixing that is approximately neutrally stable according to the schwarzschild criterion .",
    "this tends to happen regardless of whether there is a specific implimentation for semiconvection .",
    "the feedback from overshoot also causes the evolution of models with different treatments of convective boundaries to diverge significantly .",
    "the prescription for overshoot can cause the total mass of helium consumed during cheb , and therefore the duration of this phase , to vary by more than a factor of two .",
    "the uncertainty in the evolution worsens as cheb progresses .",
    "depending on the mixing scheme , the phenomenon of ` core breathing pulses ' ( cbp ) may occur near the end of cheb @xcite .",
    "cbp are characterized by a rapid growth in the mass of the convective core when the central helium abundance is very low .",
    "this process relies on feedback from the energy released by the @xmath3 reaction , which dominates when the helium abundance is low .    despite the considerable difference in the core structure produced by different treatments of mixing in models ,",
    "there is little immediate effect on the conditions at the surface , e.g. luminosity , temperature , and composition .",
    "consequently , it is difficult to use observations to constrain the mixing treatment for stellar evolution calculations .",
    "the most common method found in the literature makes use of star counts from globular clusters to infer the relative lifetimes of the cheb and ( shell helium burning ) asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phases , because these strongly depend on the mixing prescription in models .",
    "recently , asteroseismology of white dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , red giants and sdb stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has opened a new and much needed avenue for further constraining stellar models of the cheb phase ( see also paper  i ) .",
    "early attempts to constrain cheb evolution from asteroseismology were indirect . @xcite",
    "deduced that a higher @xmath3 reaction rate was needed to match the central c / o determination for a pulsating white dwarf .",
    "@xcite then extended the study to the efficiency of mixing from overshoot . while the former argued an increase in the @xmath3 rate",
    "was required to match the high central oxygen abundance , the latter found that the observations were consistent with the standard rate after accounting for semiconvection .",
    "this highlights how inferences from asteroseismology can still suffer from some degeneracy caused by other uncertainties in stellar models , such as nuclear reaction rates .",
    "following the detection of modes of mixed g- and p - character in the oscillations of red giants in the _ kepler _ field @xcite , inferred the asymptotic g - mode period spacing @xmath4 for hundreds of subgiant , red giant branch ( rgb ) , and cheb stars in the _ kepler _ field . this is a particularly powerful probe because it is sensitive to the conditions deep in the core where g - modes propagate .",
    "the high values of @xmath4 typically inferred strongly contradict calculations from models with small convective cores ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in paper  i we also demonstrated that they are inconsistent with models with a semiconvection or partially mixed zone . to match the range of @xmath4 reported , we required models with our newly developed ` maximal overshoot ' scheme , which produces the largest possible convective core .",
    "we also showed , however , that some modes can be strongly trapped at the boundary of the semiconvection or a partially mixed zone , raising the apparent @xmath4 so that it is consistent with the determinations by .      in galactic globular clusters , which are composed of old , approximately coeval stars , the lifetime of each late phase of evolution is proportional to the number of stars observed in that phase .",
    "this property is important in the current context because the mixing scheme strongly governs the amount of helium burned during cheb .",
    "it therefore also controls the respective longevity of the cheb and early - agb ( subsequent helium - shell burning ) phases .    by considering the then available determinations of @xmath5 and @xmath6 for three clusters ( m15 , m93 , and ngc  5466 ) , @xcite concluded that the models with semiconvection by , that spend longer on the hb and",
    "more rapidly ascend the agb , were a better match to the observations compared with the models without semiconvection from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this finding was then further supported by @xmath7 and @xmath8 determinations for 15 clusters .",
    "although models with semiconvection were used for this comparison , the key finding is that cheb models require a mechanism to transport additional helium into the convective core , prolonging the hb lifetime and speeding up the early - agb evolution .",
    "the ratio @xmath9 is the most direct probe of the efficiency of mixing in cheb globular cluster stars .",
    "this was used by @xcite , who found that models with semiconvection , but without cbp ( which decrease @xmath0 ) , were consistent with observations of m5 from @xcite , for which it was found that @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , this and the more precise value of @xmath11 determined from later observations by @xcite , are both higher than predicted from the models without cbp favoured by @xcite , which had @xmath12 and @xmath13 , depending on the mass fraction of carbon in the core in the zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) models .",
    "in contrast , @xcite calculated relevant models with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , depending on the overshoot parameter in their non - local overshoot treatment that produces large , fully mixed cores .",
    "these examples demonstrate that @xmath0 has been used to both show the need for some kind of overshooting / semiconvection and also constrain the details of proposed mechanisms .",
    "an inspection of the literature demonstrates why conclusions based on observations of @xmath0 ought to be revisited .",
    "studies that include star counts for several different clusters show a significant scatter in @xmath0 .",
    "in other studies , only a single cluster is used .",
    "the nine clusters with more than 100 hb stars included in , for example , span a range of @xmath16 .",
    "determinations of @xmath0 , even for the same cluster , can vary considerably . in the cluster ngc 6809 ( m55 ) , for example , , @xcite , and @xcite determined @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively , each with samples of more than 200 stars",
    ". the disagreement can be even worse when fewer stars are observed : found @xmath20 from 51 stars in ngc  6171 whereas @xcite report @xmath21 from 146 stars .",
    "the sizes of these differences suggest that inferences about stellar physics from @xmath0 may be bolstered by exploiting the more recent and numerous globular cluster photometry from hst .",
    "another related diagnostic is the magnitude ( or luminosity ) of the agb clump , which is the observed clustering of early - agb stars in the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "first noted that such a clump was visible 1.5mag above the hb level in globular clusters with clear agb sequences . in evolution calculations",
    "this coincides with core helium exhaustion and the subsequent slow luminosity change at the beginning of shell helium burning .",
    "importantly , the surface luminosity during this event is dependent on the mixing during the earlier cheb phase .",
    "showed , for example , that artificially suppressing cbp increases the luminosity of the agb clump .",
    "this suppression also shortens the hb lifetime and increases the agb lifetime , better matching the observed ratio @xmath0 in m5 .      despite nature",
    "having provided us with a large sample of nearby globular clusters , the interpretation of the observations presents a number of challenges . in order to identify the current stage of evolution of a star from photometry",
    "we require the agb and the rgb stars to form distinct sequences . to correctly infer lifetimes",
    "the photometry must be nearly complete , or not have a bias against one of the populations , e.g. by excluding hot hb stars .",
    "cluster membership should also be verified to avoid contamination .",
    "the ability to use star counts to explain specific physical phenomena is also dependent on our wider understanding of stellar evolution .",
    "the determination of initial helium content from the ratio @xmath5 , for example , is sensitive to the @xmath3 reaction rate @xcite and binary interaction which could affect that ratio by truncating the evolution before the hb .",
    "fortunately , binary interaction is unlikely to be problematic for inferring lifetimes from @xmath0 because those stars have already survived the rgb .",
    "instead , we must consider the possibility that @xmath0 is reduced because some hb stars , whose envelope is too small for there to be a second ascent of the giant branch , become ` agb - manque ' stars .",
    "recent spectroscopic evidence suggests this evolution may be more common than predicted from models @xcite , which is an additional hazard for the interpretation of @xmath0 .",
    "the mixing in the cores of cheb models is a fundamental uncertainty that has existed since it was first shown that a slowly mixing semiconvection zone could develop outside the convective core .",
    "efforts to understand this structure have been hampered by the absence of any immediately observable effects .",
    "lately however , asteroseismology of red giants , sdb stars , and white dwarfs has offered new insights into this phase of evolution . in light of this recent progress , and with the aid of photometry superior in quality and quantity , we revisit the r - method for inferring the properties of cheb evolution from observations of globular clusters . specifically , we compare the hb and agb luminosity evolution implied from the populations in globular clusters with a suite of stellar models computed using different mixing schemes , composition , and input physics .",
    "in this study we use hst photometry of 74 galactic globular clusters from the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 filters and 65 clusters from the acs wide field channel ( wfc ) in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 filters @xcite .",
    "together , these samples contain photometry of 104 unique clusters .",
    "these data are advantageous for two reasons : they comprise two large homogeneous samples , and the photometry is reasonably complete at the magnitudes relevant for this study ( which we show below ) .",
    "the two filter sets do not exactly match any other systems .",
    "@xcite describes @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands as johnson b and johnson v , and the @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands as broad v and broad i , respectively .    in the acs globular cluster survey @xcite , the flux of each unsaturated star",
    "was determined by fitting a point spread function constructed for each exposure . the technique from @xcite was used to find the flux for stars with saturated pixels .",
    "the reliability of the method for determining flux from saturated pixels was confirmed by comparing against unsaturated shorter exposures .",
    "crowding is only problematic for stars in the centre of clusters with compact cores , such as ngc  2808 . in that case",
    ", the artificial star tests by @xcite predict a completeness of 60 per cent in the cluster centre for stars with the magnitude of the extreme hb ( the faintest stars we are interested in ) .",
    "the completeness then rapidly improves with increasing distance from the centre .",
    "fortunately , most clusters in the photometry sample are close to 100 per cent complete above the subgiant branch level @xcite .",
    "the artificial star experiments performed by for ngc  104 and ngc  6723 ( clusters with high and low central density , respectively ) showed that the photometry has high completeness to more than 2 magnitudes fainter than the faintest hb stars . therefore , except for clusters with extreme hbs , we do not expect incompleteness to influence any of our findings .",
    "we correct for reddening in the data by using the corrections provided , which are originally from the @xcite catalogue .",
    "we also use the @xcite catalogue ( 2010 edition ) to correct for reddening in the @xcite photometry . in that case",
    "we use the @xmath26 correction because , according to the extinction law from @xcite , it corresponds almost exactly to the @xmath27 correction required .",
    "we limit our analysis to clusters that have clearly defined hb and agb sequences , which excludes photometry with obvious large photometric errors .",
    "we note that this procedure could introduce a selection bias but that we still include 48 globular clusters that meet our requirements , out of 104 , which represents a sizeable fraction of the 157 known in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "we do not expect our selection to impact on our conclusions because most of the reasons for excluding photometry are not related to stellar evolution during and after the cheb phase .",
    "additionally , we have rejected clusters with only a very small number of ( identifiable ) agb stars .",
    "selecting against clusters with few agb stars could introduce a small bias because they could be a true reflection of the lower tail of real scatter in @xmath0 .      in table",
    "[ table_r2_different_photometry ] we present the results of our star counts for 48 galactic globular clusters using data from and @xcite .",
    "we also include , for comparison , counts from @xcite . in our star",
    "counts we include all agb stars that could be identified , but note that we later restrict the agb count to stars no more than 10 times as luminous as the hb level .",
    "interestingly , there is significant variation in @xmath0 , both between , and within each data set .",
    "when considering the 15 clusters common to all three data sets , we find that @xmath0 has a standard deviation of 0.05 , 0.03 , and 0.05 for the respective , @xcite and @xcite samples .",
    "the and @xcite data sets are the most concordant pair ; the average size of the discrepancy in @xmath0 between the two sources is 0.03 . despite the differences between @xmath0 determinations for individual clusters , the overall average @xmath0 is consistent between the two hst data sets .",
    "if the observations for the 15 common clusters are combined we find @xmath28 and @xmath29 from the and @xcite data respectively , compared with @xmath30 from @xcite , where the uncertainty is calculated from equation  [ eq : r2_sigma ] .",
    "when this comparison is further restricted to the seven clusters that have more than @xmath31 ( total agb and hb ) stars in each cmd , we find similar results except that the average @xmath0 from the @xcite data decreases to 0.141 , improving the agreement with the other data .",
    "in figure  [ figure_all_r2_comparison ] we plot @xmath0 for the 31 clusters with multiple sources of photometry .",
    "the dotted grey line shows the largest difference between @xmath0 determinations for each cluster . in several clusters",
    "this difference is more than 0.1 , which is almost as large as the average @xmath0 .",
    "there is no obvious dependence of @xmath0 , or its consistency between data sets , on metallicity .",
    "we further discuss the statistics of this data in section  [ sec : statistical_errors ] and the effect of the metallicity and hb morphology in section  [ sec : z_and_hb_morph ] .",
    "we have investigated the causes of some of the significant discrepancies between @xmath0 determinations from different photometry . to this end , we have chosen three clusters with three independent counts : ngc  6093 , ngc  6652 , and ngc  7078 . in each of the three cmds of ngc  6093",
    "there are a total of more than 190 hb and agb stars . despite the large sample size ,",
    "@xmath0 is not consistent : we find @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , from @xcite , , and @xcite , respectively . when examining the photometry from @xcite , which was used for the @xcite count ,",
    "the reason for the disagreement is obvious  most of the blue hb , which is clear in the deeper @xcite photometry , is missing .",
    "excluding these ( @xmath35 ) stars from the @xcite count increases @xmath0 to about 0.22 , consistent with the @xcite result .",
    "the disagreement for this cluster is also worsened to a lesser extent by the availability of @xmath36-band photometry in the @xcite photometry .",
    "this better separates the luminous - agb from the rgb , allowing more agb stars to be identified , and increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the most metal - poor cluster in our collection , ngc  7078 ( m15 ) , also has a blue hb and a similarly large number of stars in each cmd , but it appears that in this instance the difference in @xmath0 , which ranges from @xmath37 to @xmath34 , is primarily due to the difficulty of distinguishing agb from rgb stars .",
    "a gap is apparent between the blue and red parts of the hb in both the and @xcite photometry .",
    "the fraction of hb stars on the blue side of the gap is around 0.41 , with agreement between the two sets to about 1 per cent , suggesting inconsistent completeness is not the problem . unlike the previous example , the blue hb also is well populated in the older photometry from that is included in @xcite .",
    "a similar issue seems to be at play for ngc  6752 .",
    "we find @xmath38 from the @xcite photometry which is exactly double the result in @xcite . again",
    ", this difference appears to be due to the difficulty of distinguishing between agb and rgb stars in the older @xmath39 photometry from , rather than missing blue hb stars .",
    "our result is also consistent with @xmath40 photometry from y. momany ( private communication ) which has a very clear agb sequence , and from which we find @xmath41 .",
    "there is a considerable spread in @xmath0 determinations for ngc  6652 .",
    "we find @xmath42 and @xmath43 from the and @xcite photometry , respectively , while @xcite reports @xmath44 .",
    "we attribute this variation to the small number of hb and agb stars ( there are fewer than a total of 100 in each cmd ) , and the difficulty in positively identifying agb stars , especially for the ground - based photometry from used by @xcite .     for clusters shown in table  [ table_r2_different_photometry ] , limited to those with at least two different sources of photometry .",
    "the @xmath0 determined from the @xcite , , and @xcite data are shown in black dash - dots , red dashes , and a blue solid line , respectively .",
    "the dotted grey line shows the maximum difference between @xmath0 determinations from different photometry . ]      in order to compare observations with theoretical models we must relate the observed magnitude to luminosity . throughout this study",
    "we do this by converting from the magnitude observed to luminosity .",
    "this conveniently minimizes the importance of colour - temperature transformations and the mlt mixing length calibration ( see section  [ sec : mlt ] ) . to convert magnitude to luminosity we use the colour - temperature relations from @xcite and the bolometric corrections from @xcite for the photometry .",
    "we also use bolometric corrections from @xcite for the @xcite photometry , but in that case also use them to derive a colour - temperature relation .",
    "we do not attempt to find the absolute luminosity of the observed stars , which would be subject to the uncertainties in the distance of each cluster .",
    "we instead rescale the luminosity so that it is expressed relative to that of the hb , i.e. we use @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the derived luminosity and @xmath47 is the mode of the @xmath48 distribution for a cluster , i.e. the typical luminosity for hb stars .",
    "we calculate @xmath0 and @xmath49 ( defined below ) from the luminosity probability density function ( pdf ) determined from the observations .",
    "each luminosity pdf @xmath50 is constructed from a sample of @xmath51 stars by the addition of gaussian functions so that @xmath52},\\ ] ] where @xmath53 represents each star , @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the luminosity of each star , @xmath56 is the mode of the @xmath48 distribution , and @xmath57 is the standard deviation which determines the smoothness of the resulting function .",
    "the value of @xmath57 chosen for each cluster depends on the number of stars but it is generally around @xmath58 .",
    "this is typically large enough for there to be a well defined peak from the agb clump in the luminosity pdf .",
    "the luminosity difference between the agb clump and the hb is defined as @xmath59 this is just the difference in @xmath60 between the two peaks in the luminosity pdf .",
    "we can also caculate @xmath0 from the luminosity pdf .",
    "we define the boundary between the hb and agb to be the location of the minimum in the luminosity pdf between the hb and agb clump peaks , @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath0 is thus the ratio of the integral of the luminosity pdf above and below this peak : @xmath62 where for convenience we have defined @xmath63 as @xmath60 , and @xmath64 is the luminosity cut - off for the agb that we introduce in section  [ sec : z_and_hb_morph ] .",
    "we account for statistical errors in a manner similar to previous studies , i.e. by assuming that the ratio of agb to hb stars follows a poisson distribution .",
    "this gives a variance @xmath65 and therefore standard error @xmath66 this is strictly true only if the observed ratio @xmath67 is the ratio expected from an infinitely large sample .",
    "it is also larger , by a very small factor of @xmath68 , than the result found by assuming that there is a binomial distribution of hb and agb stars .",
    "it is important to note that this error analysis is not exhaustive .",
    "there are other sources of error that were raised in section  [ sec : introduction ] , but which are not easily quantifiable .",
    "we have determined the statistical uncertainty in @xmath0 and @xmath49 in our aggregate data sets ( e.g. those in section  [ sec : red_hb_clusters ] ) from monte carlo simulations . in this method",
    "we use the observed luminosity probability density functions to randomly populate hundreds of artificial data sets from which we calculate @xmath0 and @xmath49 using the same method as for observations .",
    "the error bars for @xmath69 in figure  [ figure_cluster_properties_z ] and figure  [ figure_cluster_properties_hb ] are 1-@xmath57 and generated by determining @xmath69 from monte carlo simulations using different sample sizes and the luminosity pdf of the data set comprising every cluster without a blue hb .",
    "this also revealed a bias towards higher @xmath69 for smaller data sets .",
    "for example , we calculated the average @xmath69 for samples of @xmath70 and @xmath71 stars to be @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , compared with the true value of @xmath74 , this discrepancy , however , is well within the respective 1-@xmath57 uncertainties ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "we have not corrected for this source of error in figure  [ figure_cluster_properties_z ] and figure  [ figure_cluster_properties_hb ] .",
    "we have also tested the effect of random photometric errors @xmath77 by allowing for them when populating the luminosity pdf in the monte carlo simulations . with sample sizes of @xmath78 and",
    "@xmath79 the error in @xmath0 and @xmath69 is unaffected if @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "this increases to @xmath82 for the combined data set 6366 stars from all clusters without a blue hb .",
    "this allowance can accommodate the size of the estimated errors provided with the photometry , with the possible exception of blue hb stars .",
    "the uncertainty for these stars does not , however , affect the determination of @xmath0 and @xmath69 .",
    "it is still possible that photometric errors affect our results by causing the misidentification of stars , e.g. blending of the rgb and agb sequences , or the blue hb and the main sequence .",
    "the former is possible because the two are so close in the cmd while the latter is possible because the error is larger for fainter stars .",
    "however , if it is assumed that the hb and agb stars are properly identified then the photometric errors do not add to the uncertainty of either @xmath0 or @xmath69 .",
    "we have tested whether , after accounting for the known statistical uncertainty , the values of @xmath0 are consistent with the overall weighted mean @xmath83 . in figure  [ figure_r2_statistics ]",
    "we show the distribution of the difference between @xmath0 for each cluster and the overall mean , expressed as a fraction of the 1-@xmath57 standard error . in both the and @xcite cases ,",
    "the distribution is wider than expected from the above hypothesis .",
    "the standard deviations for the respective samples are @xmath84 and @xmath85 compared with an expected value of @xmath86 .",
    "this suggests that ( i ) we have underestimated the errors and/or ( ii ) @xmath0 is cluster dependent .",
    "we already know that the first possibility is true , since we have only accounted for one of the possible sources of error ( which were discussed in section  [ sec : methods ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec : z_and_hb_morph ] we investigate the second possibility by analysing the observations and in section  [ composition_and_input_physics ] we quantify how various factors , such as composition and stellar mass , affect theoretical predictions of @xmath0 .      in figure  [ figure_cluster_properties_z ] we present @xmath0 and @xmath69 for the 48 clusters in this study . in this calculation of @xmath0 , we limit the agb count to @xmath87 , which is different from the method used for figure  [ figure_all_r2_comparison ] where all ( identified ) agb stars are included .",
    "we use this luminosity limit for the remainder of the paper because it enables a consistent comparison of @xmath0 between different clusters and between observations and predictions from models .",
    "figure  [ figure_all_r2_comparison ] shows that we do not detect any significant trend in either @xmath0 or @xmath69 with metallicity .",
    "the lines of best fit ( and those in subsequent figures ) are constructed by weighting the data points according to the reciprocal of the 1-@xmath57 error .",
    "the weighted average @xmath88 is the same for both data sets ( note that this is higher than @xmath69 calculated in section  [ sec : red_hb_clusters ] from combined data sets ) . when accounting for the uncertainties there is also agreement in the average @xmath0 : we find @xmath89 from the data and @xmath90 from the @xcite data .",
    "figure  [ figure_cluster_properties_hb ] is the same as figure  [ figure_cluster_properties_z ] except that @xmath0 and @xmath69 are plotted against @xmath91 , the colour ( @xmath92 ) difference between the middle of the hb and the rgb determined by @xcite , i.e. a measure of the ` blueness ' of the hb .",
    "the 14 clusters without @xmath93 and @xmath94 determinations ( i.e. those with only photometry ) are not shown in this figure .",
    "the clusters from both sets of data divide into three groups with distinct @xmath91 . in the middle group of clusters , with @xmath95",
    ", there appears to be a strong negative correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath91 , but this trend is not preserved when the more red and the more blue hb groups are included .",
    "when all of the clusters are considered , there appears to be at most a weak correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath91 , i.e. @xmath0 does not strongly depend on the stellar factors that control hb morphology , principally mass , metallicity , and helium content .",
    "we did not detect any dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath91 for the observations shown in figure  [ figure_cluster_properties_hb ] . although the trend line for the @xcite sample shows a positive correlation between @xmath69 and @xmath91 ( with a gradient of @xmath96 ) that is concordant with the example models , the trend in the observations is due entirely to the six clusters with the bluest hbs , and these have a large scatter .",
    "we further discuss the dependence of @xmath69 on hb morphology with reference to the stellar models in section  [ sec : overall_model_obs_comparison ] .",
    "it has been proposed that the lack of cn - strong @xcite and sodium - rich agb stars in globular clusters could be due to a sizeable fraction of the ( low mass ) blue hb stars not evolving to the agb .",
    "our analysis of the observations reveals there is no dependence of @xmath0 on the colour of the midpoint of the hb ( figure  [ figure_cluster_properties_hb ] ) , which would appear to contradict assertions that some blue hb stars do not reach the agb .",
    "the picture is changed , however , when the colour of the bluest extent , rather than the midpoint , of the hb is considered . in figure  [ figure_cluster_properties_blue_hb ]",
    "we show @xmath0 and @xmath49 for the clusters with a blue hb plotted against the colour difference between the blue end ( fourth percentile ) of the hb and the rgb ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "it is clear from both the and @xcite data sets that @xmath0 is lower in clusters with a bluer hb tail .",
    "it is conceivable that the dependence of @xmath0 on the extent of the blue hb results from the lower luminosity of blue hb stars : this would reduce the luminosity cut - off for the agb and reduce the number of agb stars included in the count , and therefore @xmath0 .",
    "there are two arguments against this though : ( i ) there is only a weak dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath98 ( i.e. we are still including the same luminosity range of agb stars , independent of the extent of the blue hb ) , and ( ii ) @xmath0 is not substantially lower for clusters in which the middle of the hb is blue ( i.e. those with the highest @xmath99 ) , which would be the case if more agb stars were excluded from our counts in clusters with a blue hb .",

    "the colour range is smaller , reducing the effect of imperfect bolometric corrections .",
    "the luminosity of the hb is unambiguous and therefore so is the cut - off for the agb luminosity .",

    "given that @xmath0 in standard models is already lower than the observed range , this appears to be another strong restriction on the magnetic dipole moments of neutrinos , which would increase the emission from plasmon decay .",
    "if the standard neutrino emission rate is restored after the flash , the models both show @xmath137 the main structural change in those models is an increase of the h - exhausted core mass at the flash . multiplying the neutrino emission rate by a factor of four increases the h - exhausted core mass at the flash @xmath138 by @xmath139 . the dependence in equation  [ eq : r2_neutrino ]",

    "this should be an obligatory consideration when comparing stellar models with globular cluster observations to determine these constraints .",
    "although this is beyond the scope of this study , we note that unlike the earlier rgb evolution in which the core is degenerate , the burning shell that surrounds the degenerate core during the early - agb is hot enough to support helium burning ( and is hotter than cheb ) .",
    "this would have implications for temperature sensitive effects , such as primakoff conversion from axion - photon coupling which has a specific energy loss rate that goes as @xmath143 @xcite .",

    "this conclusively shows that the dissimilar cheb evolution in models with a different initial mass stems from how it affects the zero - age hb mass .",
    "this is important because there is some degeneracy between mass loss rate and initial mass / cluster age .",
    "moreover , the change in @xmath0 from increasing the initial mass but keeping helium constant is opposite to that found when helium is also adjusted so that the age is kept constant when the mass is increased ( see section  [ sec : helium ] ) .",

    "the most important factor for @xmath69 is composition , including both helium abundance and metallicity .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath0 in models is comparable to the statistical uncertainty in the observations ( @xmath165 ) but for @xmath69 the uncertainty in models is many times larger than the statistical uncertainty in the observations(@xmath166 ) .",
    "both of these uncertainties are smaller than the changes resulting from the use of different mixing schemes ( see e.g. figure  [ figure_mixing_comparison]c ) .",
    "this confirms that @xmath0 and @xmath69 are powerful constraints for the mixing in the core .        in our standard overshoot models",
    "we apply the overshooting scheme proposed by where there is an exponential decay in diffusion coefficient according to @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the diffusion coefficient at distance @xmath169 from the convective boundary and @xmath170 is the diffusion coefficient just inside the boundary .",

    "this temporarily speeds up the rate of increase of the surface luminosity .",
    "these episodes are analogous to the rgb luminosity function bump which is caused by the advance of the hydrogen - burning shell through the composition discontinuity left by first dredge - up .",
    "this explanation makes it clear why none of the other mixing schemes show this phenomenon : the no - overshoot and maximal - overshoot models do not have a partially mixed zone and the semiconvection models do not leave behind any composition discontinuities .",
    "the clarity of the subsequent peaks in the agb luminosity pdf depends on both the difference in composition across the discontinuities and the mass enclosed by them .",
    "if two discontinuities are close together in mass ( or one is near to the earlier boundary of the convective core ) then it can be hard to distinguish the two peaks . in the case where cbp are prevented , for example ,",

    "this means that after core helium exhaustion there is no composition discontinuity to burn through until the front moves to the edge of the partially mixed zone , which occurs when the luminosity is much higher ( when @xmath183 in that example ) .",

    "the 10myr ( @xmath190 per cent of the cheb lifetime ; figure  [ figure_standardovershoot_dt]b ) variation in the cheb lifetime resulting from different time steps is also smaller than it is for the suite of models with different @xmath175 ( figure  [ figure_standardovershoot_comparison]b ) .",
    "we do not find a correlation between the size of the time steps and the properties of the evolution , mirroring our finding for modifications to @xmath175 .",
    "we have shown that time step constraints and the overshoot prescription can both have unpredictable and severe effects on the evolution of standard - overshoot models late in cheb , importantly including predictions for @xmath69 and @xmath0 .",
    "the stochasticity of the evolution is the reason we did not use standard overshoot in the earlier sections to quantify the effects of altering the input physics .",
    "moreover , we note that the evolution of a single model produces agb clump peaks in the luminosity pdf ( e.g. figure  [ figure_standardovershoot_comparison]c and  [ figure_standardovershoot_dt]c ) that are broader than both of those resulting from the addition of observed data for multiple clusters ( figure  [ figure_all_red_hb ] ) .",
    "considering that combining data from different clusters , photometric errors , and contamination are all likely to _ widen _ the agb clump peak , this disagreement provides further strong evidence against the credibility of the late cheb evolution that arises from the use of standard overshoot ( i.e. cbp ) .",

    "the other sequences have a monotonic decrease in central helium abundance and a stability in the size of the convective core .",
    "we have performed an experiment to separate the immediate effects of each mixing prescription from their cumulative effect on the stellar structure .",
    "we began by selecting three late - cheb 1m@xmath107 models from paper  i with no overshoot , semiconvection , and maximal overshoot ",
    "the three schemes that avoid cbp .",
    "beginning from models with the same central helium abundance ( @xmath192 ) , we then continued the evolution using the standard - overshoot prescription .",
    "each of the three then displayed cpb , but to different extents .",
    "the no - overshoot model showed the largest breathing pulse .",
    "this led to an increase in central helium abundance of @xmath193 , compared with @xmath194 for the largest core breathing pulse in the original standard overshoot run .",
    "this demonstrates how unstable this small core is late in cheb .",
    "the next largest core breathing pulse was seen in the maximal - overshoot model which had @xmath195 .",
    "the substantial difference between this and the no - overshoot model may be attributed to the already large convective core .",
    "the smallest cbp seen in the semiconvection model which had @xmath196 . in that case , the radiative region immediately outside the convective core was only marginally richer in helium , limiting the potential for feedback when it was mixed into the burning region by overshoot .",
    "cbp can be prevented in models by omitting the gravitational energy term @xcite or by halting the enlargement of the convective core if it will lead to an increase in the central helium abundance .",
    "our semiconvection model is unusual in that cbp are avoided without explicitly altering the physics for the end of cheb .",
    "we have shown that in this phase the structure is such that if the schwarzschild criterion for convection is used , any overshoot will trigger cbp . like the models from @xcite without cbp , our two methods that do have mixing beyond the schwarzschild boundary but avoid cbp also have a non - local treatment of convection .",
    "the semiconvection method has a limit on how steeply the diffusion coefficient can change through the structure . in the maximal overshoot method , the extent of overshooting at the boundary is determined by @xmath197 further inside the convection zone .",
    "the thick line in figure  [ figure_standardovershoot_comparison ] shows the result of suppressing cbp by turning off convective overshoot before the size of the convective core becomes unstable ( in this case when the central helium abundance is @xmath198 ) .",
    "it is clear from panel  ( c ) that this model spends relatively more time on the agb ( i.e. with @xmath199 ) , and therefore that this method of preventing cbp increases @xmath0 .",
    "this is caused by both a reduction in the cheb lifetime and an increase in the early - agb lifetime ( figure  [ figure_standardovershoot_comparison]b ) .",
    "the drastic effect on the evolution of standard - overshoot sequences from small changes in @xmath175 and time step ( section  [ sec : overshoot_dependence ] and  [ sec : numerical_dependence ] ) is primarily due to how these influence the development of cbp .",
    "the luminosity of the agb clump for the model with cbp suppressed ( thick line in figure  [ figure_standardovershoot_comparison]c ) is consistent with that in models with cbp .",
    "the peak in the luminosity pdf is noticeably thinner , however , for reasons explained in section  [ sec : overshoot_dependence ] , and it better matches the observations .",
    "in contrast with @xmath69 , @xmath0 is strongly affected by the prevention of cbp . in the test model ,",
    "@xmath0 is increased to 0.143 , compared with a range of @xmath177 ( with median @xmath185 ) for the other sequences shown .",
    "this consequence of the suppression of cbp ( by different means ) has been shown before .      in paper",
    "i we showed that the maximal - overshoot mixing scheme was the only one of the four that could match the high asymptotic g - mode period spacing inferred from asteroseismic observations ( i.e. , it did not rely on the effects of mode trapping ) .",
    "the models with this scheme that we have shown so far , however , predict @xmath0 much lower , and @xmath100 much higher , than observed ( figure  [ figure_mixing_comparison ] ) .",
    "the no - overshoot and maximal - overshoot sequences display a phenomenon known as gravonuclear loops .",
    "these are evident from the oscillation in surface luminosity near 55myr and 108myr for the respective sequences in figure  [ figure_mixing_comparison](b ) .",
    "there is also an oscillation in the effective temperature during this period , thereby giving rise to loops within the agb clump in the hr diagram .",
    "this phenomenon occurs when the he - burning shell encounters a large composition discontinuity at the former boundary of the convective core , causing discrete episodes of strong helium burning ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the energy generation is high enough to trigger convection temporarily .",
    "the gravonuclear loops finally end when the convective mixing has smoothed the composition gradient that originally induced them .",
    "the standard overshoot and semiconvection models have ( relatively ) smooth composition gradients at the end of cheb , and hence avoid the gravonuclear instability .    in the maximal - overshoot sequences shown in figures  [ figure_mixing_comparison]-[figure_different_reaction_rates2 ]",
    "there is no overshooting at convective boundaries after core helium burning finishes . in figure  [ figure_mo_os ]",
    "we show the effect of including overshooting at the boundaries of the convection zones that emerge during helium shell burning .",
    "those three sequences show that the existence and extent of overshooting has a substantial impact on the early - agb evolution . in the run with @xmath200 , for example ,",
    "the early - agb lifetime is extended by 4myr , increasing @xmath0 from 0.082 to 0.139 , i.e. to above the observed value of @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ figure_maximal_overshoot_eagb ] shows the internal evolution for three cases : no overshooting , overshooting only at the outer convective boundaries , and overshooting at all convective boundaries .",
    "the two runs that only differ by their treatment of overshoot at the outer boundaries of convection zones are nearly identical .",
    "in contrast , overshooting beneath the helium burning convection zones has profound consequences .",
    "the inclusion of convective overshooting with @xmath201 beneath convection zones has a significant effect .",
    "the position of peak helium burning moves inward by about 0.04m@xmath107 .",
    "the gravonuclear loop phase is extended by about 0.5myr , but this only accounts for part of the almost 2myr increase in early - agb lifetime .",
    "the model also finishes the gravonuclear loop phase with lower luminosity and having burnt less helium . once the luminosity increases , the rates of change of the h - burning and he - burning luminosity are the same as for models without overshooting beneath the helium burning convection zones ( only it is offset by 1.8myr ) .    if more penetrating overshoot is used , such as in the run with @xmath200 , the gravonuclear loop convection zones rapidly reach the ashes of helium burning .",
    "this puts an end to the gravonuclear loop phase and quiescent shell helium burning begins . during this period",
    "the peak of nuclear burning moves inward by 0.12m@xmath107 and the surface luminosity drops almost to the hb level ( figure  [ figure_mo_os]b ) .",
    "once the helium burning shell advances far enough to enclose the same mass as it does in the model without overshoot after the gravonuclear loop phase , the rates of change of the h - burning and he - burning luminosity are again the same as that model ( this time offset by 4myr ) .",
    "the subsequent slow luminosity increase during quiescent helium burning produces a diffuse peak in the luminosity pdf ( figure  [ figure_mo_os]c ) that is at odds with observations ( figure  [ figure_mo_os]c ) .",
    "analogous with the case of hydrogen shell burning , when helium burning occurs with a less massive helium exhausted core beneath it , the burning occurs at a lower temperature .",
    "this happens at the beginning of shell helium burning as a consequence of overshoot eroding the he - exhausted core .",
    "introducing overshoot of @xmath202 and @xmath203 reduces the shell temperature immediately after the cessation of gravonuclear loops from 128mk to 99mk and 90mk , respectively .",
    "as previously mentioned , this slows the evolution , but it also favours the @xmath3 reaction , decreasing the final c / o ratio in the degenerate co core .",
    "figure  [ figure_mo_os](c ) shows that increasing @xmath175 decreases @xmath69 and increases @xmath0 .",
    "although the values of @xmath175 were arbitrary , if we take the average from the models with @xmath201 and @xmath200 we find @xmath204 and @xmath205 , which is a reasonable match to the observations .",
    "this demonstrates that our models with a large convective core and a single composition discontinuity at the end of cheb can also be consistent with the globular cluster observations , but only if convective overshoot moves the helium burning front inward ( in mass ) by a particular amount .",
    "the maximal overshoot runs with subsequent convective overshoot have a core helium burning lifetime more than 10myr longer than the standard overshoot models without core breathing pulses . both of these models can fit the @xmath0 and @xmath69 constraints and neither can yet be ruled out by asteroseismology ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the lifetime disparity is therefore an important uncertainty for various other constraints that are derived from counting hb stars , such as globular cluster initial helium abundance and bounds on axion - photon coupling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the difference in cheb lifetime between these two runs , and therefore predictions for the ratio @xmath5 , equates to a change in inferred initial helium abundance of @xmath206 .",

    "we tested reducing the maximum agb luminosity from @xmath207 to @xmath208 , which is high enough for the agb clump to still be included in the luminosity pdf for clusters without a blue extension to the hb ( figure  [ figure_cluster_properties_z ] ) as well as ( most of ) the computed sequences .",
    "this change reduces the observed @xmath0 from 0.114 and 0.127 to 0.091 and 0.095 for the and @xcite samples , respectively , and interestingly improves their consistency .    lowering the agb luminosity limit has variable consequences for predictions of @xmath0 .",
    "unsurprisingly , the decrease in the predicted r@xmath209 is largest for models with a high @xmath69 , because this truncation excludes part of the agb clump peak in the luminosity pdf ( but almost never more than half ) .",
    "the luminosity pdfs of the models with different mixing schemes are generally quite similar for @xmath210 ( and especially so for @xmath211 ) so reducing the cut - off has a uniform effect on @xmath0 for most cases ( see e.g. figure  [ figure_mixing_comparison]c , [ figure_different_reaction_rates2]c , [ figure_standardovershoot_dt]c , [ figure_mo_os]c ) .",
    "the sequences shown in figure  [ figure_mixing_comparison ] are typical : by decreasing the cut - off to @xmath212 @xmath0 is reduced from 0.096 , 0.068 , and 0.082 to 0.070 , 0.043 , and 0.057 for the standard - overshoot , semiconvection , and maximal overshoot models , respectively .",
    "this @xmath213 in all three cases , compared with @xmath214 for the observations .",
    "the equivalent standard - overshoot model with cbp suppressed ( thick line in figure  [ figure_standardovershoot_comparison ] ) shows a larger reduction of @xmath0 , from 0.143 to 0.099 .",
    "reducing the luminosity cut - off for the @xmath0 calculation for the two maximal - overshoot sequences that include overshooting after cheb ceases ( with @xmath201 and @xmath200 respectively ; described in section  [ sec : gravonuclear_loops ] ) has an effect similar to that on the observations .",
    "those respective models show reductions of @xmath0 from 0.097 and 0.139 to 0.075 and 0.119 .",
    "overall , it appears that reducing the luminosity limit for the agb does not significantly alter the ( dis)agreement between models and observations : those which can match with @xmath215 can also match with @xmath216 , and vice versa , although in some cases the disagreement is exacerbated .",
    "the insensitivity to the luminosity limit is not unexpected considering the predominance of agb stars near the clump in both observations and theoretical predictions ( e.g. , near @xmath88 in figure  [ figure_mixing_comparison]c ) .",
    "in this paper we extended our study into the mixing in core helium burning stars in paper  i by confronting models with observations of globular clusters .",
    "the particular observational probes of core helium burning we used were ( i ) @xmath0 , the ratio of agb to hb stars , and ( ii ) @xmath69 , the luminosity difference between the agb clump and the hb , for 48 galactic globular clusters with suitable hst photometry .",
    "we compared these data to a suite of stellar models that includes four different mixing prescriptions , variations in the initial composition , and an exploration of their numerical dependence and physical uncertainties .",

    "this casts doubt on inferences about stellar evolution from @xmath0 derived from the photometry of a small number of clusters , or even a single cluster , which are common in the literature . by combining data for 48 clusters from two hst surveys , we minimized the dominant statistical uncertainty . encouragingly",
    ", the cluster to cluster variation in @xmath0 is also smaller for the newer hst photometry than for inhomogeneous photometry in the literature .    by combining photometry for the 15 clusters common to the three data sets",
    ", we found @xmath217 , @xmath218 @xcite , and @xmath219 @xcite , where the 1-sigma errors are calculated from equation  [ eq : r2_sigma ] .",
    "the two new determinations of a lower @xmath0 lessen the disagreement with standard models , and bring @xmath0 into alignment with models in the literature where core breathing pulses have been suppressed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we investigated the sources of the discrepancies between star counts from different photometry of the same clusters and found two main causes : ( i ) photometry can be incomplete , especially for blue hb stars , and ( ii ) it can be impossible to distinguish between the more luminous rgb and agb stars . to minimize errors from the latter problem we restricted the counts to stars less than 10 times as luminous as hb stars .",
    "when this method was used we did not detect any dependence of @xmath0 on metallicity ( see section  [ sec : z_and_hb_morph ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we showed in section  [ sec : photometry_comparison ] that the statistics of finite sampling can explain the majority of the scatter in @xmath0 .",
    "we also found evidence that clusters that host the bluest hb stars have abnormally low @xmath0 , supporting conjecture that a significant proportion of those stars do not evolve to the agb .    in order to better compare our models with observations we further limited the star counts in section  [ sec : red_hb_clusters ] to clusters without a blue extension of the hb .",
    "this yielded a sample of 21 cmds ( of 14 unique clusters ) comprising 6366 stars .",
    "models with each of the four different mixing schemes that were tested ( standard overshoot , no overshoot , semiconvection , and maximal overshoot ; described in section  [ sec : mixing_schemes ] ) typically can not simultaneously match @xmath1 and @xmath220 from the observations .",
    "compared with observations , the evolution sequences without convective overshoot have @xmath69 far too low and @xmath0 far too high .",
    "this is consistent with previous findings that models without overshoot disagree with globular cluster observations and asteroseismology ( e.g. paper  i ) .",
    "in contrast , our initial tests with each of the other schemes predicted @xmath0 well below that derived from observations .",
    "the semiconvection models have @xmath69 slightly too large whereas the standard overshoot models typically have about the observed value . in section  [ sec : numerical_dependence ] we showed that the predicted luminosity probability density function from standard - overshoot models with core breathing pulses is not strongly peaked enough near the agb clump ( figure  [ figure_standardovershoot_comparison]c ) . suppressing core breathing pulses removes this discrepancy and also increases @xmath0 ( to even higher than the observed value in our ad hoc test ) .",
    "these two factors are strong arguments against the validity of standard - overshoot runs with core breathing pulses that produce multiple large composition discontinuities in the partially mixed region .",
    "furthermore , in section  [ sec : gravonuclear_loops ] we demonstrated that models with the maximal - overshoot prescription can simultaneously match the observed @xmath0 and @xmath69 , but only if there is a particular amount of convective overshoot beneath the shell helium burning ` gravonuclear ' convection zones that appear during the early - agb phase .",
    "in section  [ composition_and_input_physics ] we quantified the effect that stellar mass and composition , and various physical uncertainties ( other than mixing ) , have on predictions of @xmath0 and @xmath69 . by adding each effect in quadrature we found that the respective uncertainties are @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "initial composition and hb stellar mass can each account for small changes in @xmath0 , but not enough to resolve the difference between models and observations .",
    "the most important uncertainty for @xmath0 is the @xmath3 reaction rate , which dominates late in core helium burning .",
    "a reduction of this rate tends to decrease the hb lifetime and increase @xmath0 .",
    "we found that uncertainty in the h - exhausted core mass , which we showed in paper  i could potentially account for some of the disagreement with asteroseismology , makes no appreciable change to either @xmath0 or @xmath69 .",
    "the treatment of mixing is the dominant source of uncertainty in the models ( see section  [ sec : summary_of_effects ] ) . even among models with mixing beyond the schwarzschild boundary",
    ", uncertainties in the treatment of convective boundaries and other physics can cause more than a 40myr ( roughly @xmath223 per cent ) variation in the hb lifetime , which would significantly affect any inferences from counts of hb stars .",
    "moreover , using photometry to constrain the treatment of convective boundaries in models is also made more difficult by the stochastic effect that the numerical treatment can have on the evolution during this phase ( e.g. models with standard overshoot in this study ) .    in our asteroseismology study in paper",
    "i we found that mixing schemes that produce either a large partially mixed region that can trap modes or a very large convective core , predict an @xmath224 mixed - mode period spacing that can be consistent with the observations .",
    "this work is ongoing , but it should be pointed out that in our models , these mixing schemes are only consistent with globular cluster observations if ( i ) core breathing pulses do not significantly extend the core helium burning lifetime or create large composition discontinuities within the partially mixed region ( see section  [ sec : numerical_dependence ] ) , or ( ii ) they develop very large convective cores ( e.g. maximal overshoot ) and there is a particular extent of convective overshoot beneath the convection zones that appear in the subsequent ` gravonuclear loop ' phase during the early - agb ( section  [ sec : gravonuclear_loops ] ) .",
    "the physics behind these different possibilities may perhaps now best be addressed with multi - dimensional fluid - dynamics simulations or improved theories of convective boundary mixing .",
    "finally , we emphasise that this work could be complemented by ground - based photometry that can better differentiate the agb and rgb sequences , e.g. with the @xmath40 bands .",
