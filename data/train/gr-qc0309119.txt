    "it has become generally accepted that most large galaxies contain central black holes ( e.g. @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "this is due to mounting evidence for very high luminosities within very small radii at the centre of our galaxy and many others , as well as high orbital velocities of stars very close to the centre , and is bolstered by observations of radio and optical jets , as well as seyfert galaxies and quasars at large redshifts .",
    "since the ` very small ' radii accessible by current observations are still well outside the horizons of the putative black holes , their exact nature , and even their existence , is open to debate . however , since the mean density inside the horizon of a black hole is @xmath0  g/@xmath1 , it is difficult to see how black hole collapse can be avoided above @xmath2 .",
    "the lematre - tolman ( l - t ) model describes the behaviour of a spherically symmetric dust distribution and has been a very fruitful source of models of inhomogenous cosmology , smaller scale structure formation , and even black holes and naked singularities .",
    "in paper i @xcite , we considered the problem of finding a spherically symmetric model that evolved from a given initial density profile to a given final density profile .",
    "we showed that this can always be done with an l - t model , and we developed an alogorithm to find the arbitrary functions of such an l - t model from the given profiles .",
    "a numerical example produced an abell cluster from a density fluctuation at recombination .    in paper",
    "ii @xcite , we generalised to finding l - t models that evolve from a given velocity profile to a given density profile , the converse , and also between two velocity profiles . several numerical examples , including the evolution of a void , demostrated the usefulness of the method",
    "we now utilise these methods to consider the formation of a galaxy with a central black hole , a task for which the l - t model is particularly well suited .",
    "although spiral galaxies are not exactly spherically symmetric , both the core and the halo  together containing more mass than the disk  are quite close to it , so the l - t model is not a bad first approximation .",
    "the present state of the galaxy is defined by a mass distribution that consists of two parts :    \\1 . the part outside the apparent horizon at @xmath3  for which we use an approximation to the observationally determined density profile of the m87 galaxy .",
    "this part extends inward to a sphere of mass @xmath4 , where @xmath4 is the observationally determined mass of the black hole in the m87 galaxy .",
    "\\2 . the part inside the apparent horizon at @xmath3 . since , for fundamental reasons , no observational data at all exist for this region apart from the value of @xmath4 , we were free to choose any geometry .",
    "we chose two examples :    2a .",
    "a simple subcase of the l  t model , discussed in sec .",
    "iii f as an illustrative example of properties of horizons . in this model ,",
    "the black hole does not exist initially and is formed in the course of evolution .",
    "2b . a pre - existing wormhole ,",
    "also chosen arbitrarily for simplicity of the calculations .    the boundary between the `` inside '' and `` outside '' at times other than @xmath3 goes along a comoving mass shell , so that at @xmath5 the apparent horizon resides in the inside part .    for the initial state , at @xmath6 ( the last scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation ) ,",
    "no usable observational data are available , either , but hopefully only temporarily .",
    "the expected angular size on the cmb sky of a perturbation that will develop into a single galaxy ( 0.004@xmath7 ) is much smaller than the current best resolution ( 0.2@xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore we tried an exactly homogeneous initial density and a homogeneous initial velocity .",
    "the former turned out to lead to an unacceptable configuration at @xmath3 : a collapsing hyperbolic model with no big bang in the past .",
    "consequently , we settled on the homogeneous initial velocity , which then implied the amplitude below @xmath8 for the initial density perturbation .    these two states , at @xmath9 and @xmath3 ,",
    "uniquely define the l  t model that evolves between them , as shown in paper ii .",
    "the 3-d surface graphs of density as a function of mass and time show that the evolution proceeds without shell crossings , and so the model is acceptable , at least qualitatively .",
    "the lematre - tolman ( l - t ) model @xcite is a spherically symmetric nonstatic solution of the einstein equations with a dust source .",
    "see @xcite for an extensive list of properties and other work on this model .",
    "its metric is : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an arbitrary function of integration , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 obeys @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the cosmological constant .",

    "note that all the formulae given so far are covariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations @xmath28 , and so @xmath29 can be chosen at will .",
    "this means one of the three functions @xmath11 , @xmath30 and @xmath27 can be fixed at our convenience by the appropriate choice of @xmath31 .",
    "we can define a scale radius and a scale time for each worldline with @xmath32 and it is evident from ( [ ellev ] ) that , for the elliptic case , these are the maximum @xmath33 and the lifetime for each @xmath29 value .",
    "the crunch time is then @xmath34    writing eq .",

    "the parametric solutions ( [ ellev ] ) and ( [ hypev ] ) can also be written    @xmath38    for the expanding and collapsing elliptic cases , and @xmath39 for the hyperbolic case ( expanding ) .",

    "the friedmann models are contained in the l - t class as the limit : @xmath45 and one of the standard radial coordinates for the friedmann model results if the coordinates in ( [ ellev ] )  ( [ hypev ] ) are additionally chosen so that : @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 being constants .    in constructing our galaxy model",
    ", it will be convenient to use @xmath30 as the radial coordinate ( i.e. @xmath49 )  because in most sections we shall not need to pass through any  necks \" or  bellies \" .",

    "then with @xmath50 : @xmath51    in the present paper we will apply the l - t model to a problem related to that considered in papers i & ii : connecting , by an l - t evolution , an initial state of the universe , defined by a mass - density or velocity distribution , to a final state defined by a density distribution that contains a black hole .",
    "an origin , or centre of spherical symmetry , occurs at @xmath52 if @xmath53 for all @xmath54 .",

    "they create undesireable singularities where the density diverges and changes sign .",
    "the conditions on the 3 arbitrary functions that ensure none be present anywhere in an l - t model , as well as those for regular maxima and minima in spatial sections , were given in @xcite , and will be used below .",
    "we will be modelling a galactic black hole , so it will be useful to consider its horizons .",

    "we lay out further details of the apparent horizon here .",
    "let us write the evolution equation ( [ rtsq ] ) with @xmath19 as @xmath64 the radial light rays must be geodesics by symmetry : @xmath65 and this may be written as @xmath66 whose solution we write as @xmath67 , or often just @xmath68 or @xmath69 .      along a ray",
    "we have @xmath70 the apparent horizon ( ah ) is the hypersurface in spacetime where the rays are momentarily at constant @xmath33 : @xmath71 there are in fact two apparent horizons : + the future ah :  ( ah@xmath72 ) , where    @xmath73    we find @xmath74 along the ah by differentiating ( [ eqaphor ] ) : @xmath75 giving @xmath76 and , since @xmath77 on the ah , @xmath78 in the vacuum case @xmath79 , which implies @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 since @xmath82 . note that @xmath80 could be only local , so the ah would only be null in that region . in the schwarzschild metric , where @xmath80 everywhere , this is consistent with @xmath77 being the locus of the event horizons ; and in this case",
    "they coincide with the apparent horizons .",
    "recall that in the schwarzschild spacetime the future & past event horizons , eh@xmath72 & eh@xmath83 , cross in the neck at the moment it is widest .",
    "( call this event o. ) this holds for l - t models too . for hyperbolic regions , with @xmath84 along each dust worldline ,",
    "there is either only expansion or only collapse , i.e. only one ah ( either ah@xmath72 or ah@xmath83 ) can occur .",

    "what can be seen in the sky are only electromagnetic waves emitted by objects that were still outside the ah at the time of emission .",
    "consequently , we are not constrained in any way in choosing a model for the matter in the interior of a black hole , except for the need to match it smoothly to a galaxy model .",

    "firstly , there is the schwarzschild - kruskal - szekeres black hole , which has the topology of two universes joined by a temporary wormhole , and begins its life as a white hole .",

    "there are two important points to be remembered :    1 .",
    "the matter proceeding toward a black hole disappears from the field of view of any real observer before it hits the horizon , whatever horizon is meant ( see below ) .",
    "for example , the event horizon is the boundary of the field of view for an observer at future null infinity , i.e. one who is infinitely distant from the black hole and infinitely far into the future .",
    "therefore , the observationally determined `` mass of a black hole '' is in fact only an upper limit of the mass that has actually fallen within the horizon ; the latter can never be measured in reality .",
    "_ models _ of black holes allow us to _ calculate _ better estimates of that mass , and even if the arithmetic difference between a model calculation and an observational limit is small , it is important to understand the conceptual difference .",
    "it is incorrect to speak about the event horizon in the context of observations .",
    "we may know where the event horizon is only in a _",
    "model_. in practice , we would have to be able to take into account the future fate of every piece of matter , including those pieces that have been outside our field of view up to now  an obviously impossible task .",
    "worse still , if the real universe is to recollapse in the future , we might already be inside the event horizon and will never see any signature of it .",
    "hence , the horizons whose signatures we have any chance to see ( like disappearance of matter from sight , or a large mass being contained in a small volume ) are _ apparent horizons _",
    " they are local entities , detectable in principle at any instant ( although with the difficulty mentioned in point 1 ) . even in our simple model considered in the previous section , it was rather difficult to determine the position of the event horizon , and it could be done only numerically .",
    "+ in the following we will identify the estimated black hole mass , obtained by fitting a model to present day observations , with @xmath4 , the mass within the apparent horizon at time @xmath3 ( see eq .",
    "( [ msmbhat2 ] ) ) .",
    "for this example of the interior , we use the model of section [ illustrationmodel ] , but with different values of the parameters .",

    "therefore we find both types of black hole are possible",
    ". perhaps small black holes , that avoid evaporation by rapid accretion , may seed galaxy formation .    in fact , existing observational data does not have the resolution to constrain the initial data for our model .",
    "for example , as shown in paper i , the perturbations of isotropy of the cmb temperature corresponding to single galaxies should have the angular size of @xmath304 degrees , while the most precise current measurements have the resolution of @xmath305 .",
    "then , in the vicinity of the apparent horizon , the geometry of spacetime becomes measureably non - minkowskian , while all the observational data available on mass distribution within galaxies were calculated by purely euclidean reduction methods .",
    "we also stressed that what can be inferred from observations is only the upper limit of the mass inside the apparent horizon at a given time .",
    "it does not make sense to even speak of an event horizon in the observational context .    in view of the paucity of data ,",
    "our approach was the first exploratory step into an uncharted territory rather than an actual model to be compared with observations .",
    "the main limitation of the spherically symmetric l - t model is the lack of rotation , which slows collapse and stablises structures .",
    "thus the model is good for much of the evolution into the non - linear regime , but becomes less realistic as collapse sets in .",
    "our results show that the l - t model is a very useful tool for this kind of investigation .",
    "however , for its parameters to be fine - tuned to results of observations , the observational data would have to be re - interpreted against the background of the l - t geometries .",
    "the research of ak was supported by the polish research committee grant no 2 p03b 12 724 .",
    "ch thanks the south african national research foundation for a grant .",
    "we briefly specialize the above results to the friedmann limit , where @xmath306 @xmath307 and @xmath308 being arbitrary constants , and @xmath309 being the scale factor .",
    "the apparent horizon , where @xmath77 , has the equation @xmath310 so by ( [ defofb ] ) , ( [ dtdr_n ] ) and ( [ timelikeah ] ) we obtain @xmath311 hence , in the friedmann limit both branches of the ah are entirely timelike ( outgoing in the expansion phase , incoming in the collapse phase ) and monotonic with @xmath29 .",
    "the derivatives @xmath312 and @xmath313 seem to become infinite at @xmath314 .",
    "this is a coordinate effect . as seen from the metric @xmath315 ,",
    "there is a coordinate singularity at @xmath316 .",
    "both derivatives become finite when the coordinates are changed so that e.g. @xmath317 . the quantity @xmath318 in eq .",
    "( [ frslope1 ] ) does not depend on the choice of @xmath29 .    for a completely general robertson - walker model ( i.e not just @xmath319 ) , repeating the whole reasoning",
    ", we obtain for the slope : @xmath320 which , after making use of the @xmath19 einstein equations , is equivalent to @xmath321 this makes the ahs timelike for @xmath322 , but spacelike for @xmath323 , or for @xmath324 .",
    "( note that @xmath325 requires @xmath326 or divergent @xmath327 . )",
    "hence , it can not be decided whether the ah is timelike or not without knowing the precise shape of the function @xmath309 ( i.e. knowing the equation of state ) .",
    "it can only be said that as long as the source in the einstein equations is ordinary matter known from laboratory ( no cosmological constant or other self - accelerating medium ) , we will have @xmath328 .",
    "consequently , by ( [ slopahrw ] ) , @xmath329 , which means that the ah will be outgoing in the expansion phase and incoming in the collapse phase .                                      ",
