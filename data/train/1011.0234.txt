    "in recent years , there has been extensive effort to study and understand the properties of complex networks .",
    "research has mainly focused on properties of single networks which do not interact or depend on other networks @xcite .",
    "recently , the robustness of two interdependent coupled networks has been studied @xcite . in interdependent networks",
    ", the failures of nodes in one network , a , will cause failures of dependent nodes in the other network , b , and _",
    "vice versa_. this process occurs recursively , and leads to a cascade of failures .",
    "it has been shown both analytically and numerically that the robustness of two interdependent networks is significantly lower compared to that of a single network @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the percolation transition in coupled networks is first order compared to the known second order transition in a single network @xcite .",
    "previous studies on two interdependent coupled networks are restricted by the condition , that to function each node in network a depends on one and only one node in network b and _ vice versa _ @xcite",
    ". however , in the real world , this assumption may not be valid .",
    "a single node in network a may depend on more than one node in network b and will function as long as one of the support nodes in network b is still connected .",
    "similarly , a node in network b may depend on more than one support nodes in network a. as long as one of the support nodes functions , the node in network b will also function .",
    "examples of such systems include the coupled power grid network and the communication network which controls the power grid , where both networks depend on each other",
    ". in general , one power station provides power to more than one communication stations , and one communication station controls more than one power stations . as long as a communication station can obtain power from one power station , it can function properly . on the other hand ,",
    "one communication station is sufficient in sending control signals which make one power station function properly .",
    "however without any power , the communication station will fail , and without control the power station will stop working . indeed in the 2003 , due to failure of some power stations in italy , the communication control system was damaged .",
    "this damage caused further fragmentation of the power grid , which finally led to a blackout in a sinificant part of italy .    under random attack , which is characterized by random removal of nodes in one or both networks ,",
    "the coupled network systems demonstrate significantly different behavior from that of a single network @xcite .",
    "the failures of nodes in network a can lead to the failures of dependent nodes in network b , and the failures of nodes in network b can produce a feedback on network a leading to further failures in network a. this process can occur recursively and can lead to a cascade of failures .",
    "we provide a theoretical framework for understanding the robustness of interdependent networks with a random number of support and dependent relationships .",
    "our theory agrees well with the numerical simulations of several model network systems , including coupled erds - rnyi ( er ) @xcite and coupled scale - free ( sf ) @xcite networks .",
    "our work extends previous works on coupled networks @xcite from _ one - to - one _ dependent - support relation to _ multiple _ poissonian dependent - support relation .",
    "our model can help to further understand real - life coupled network systems , where complex dependence - support relations may exist .",
    "we define the stable state to be the state when the cascade of failures ends .",
    "we show that for two coupled er networks the giant components of both networks in the stable state follow a simple law , which is equivalent to random percolation of a single network in the limit of a large number of support links .",
    "our theory is relevant to a broad class of real - world interdependent network systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we explain the model of the cascade of failures with random support - dependent relations . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive analytically the process of the failure cascade . in sec .",
    "iv , we present numerical tests on coupled er and sf networks .",
    "we assume two networks a and b of sizes @xmath0 and @xmath1 and with given degree distributions , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , of `` intra - links '' connecting nodes in the same network ( fig .",
    "the dependency relation is represented by a link connecting the support node in one network and the dependent node in the other network ( `` inter - links '' ) .",
    "the inter - links between network a and network b are random and uni - directional . initially ( stage @xmath16 of the failure cascade ) , there are @xmath17 inter - links distributed randomly from nodes in network b to nodes in network a , representing the dependencies of node in network a on nodes in network b. similarly , there are @xmath4 inter - links from nodes in network a to nodes in network b , representing dependencies of nodes in network b on nodes in network a. the dependent - support relations are random i.e. , for each inter - link , the support node and dependent node in the two networks are chosen randomly .",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are the initial mean degrees of the corresponding inter - links for networks a and b respectively .    in our model , one node in either network a or network b can have zero , one or several support nodes in the other network .",
    "we assume that to function each node in network a requires at least one support node in network b , and _ vice versa_. nodes in each network which are not connected to the giant components of that network by the intra - links , and nodes without support inter - links ,",
    "are considered to be not functioning and regarded as failed nodes .",
    "the attack on the network is represented by a random removal of fraction @xmath20 nodes in network a and @xmath21 in network b , where in general , @xmath22 .",
    "the process of the cascade of failures is demonstrated in fig .",
    "1 . with @xmath23",
    ", we show the case of random removal of one node in network a ( @xmath24 ) and one node in network b ( @xmath25 ) . at each stage of the cascade of failures , both networks will experience further failures . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume the random attack on network a occurs before that on network b. thus , when we analyze the first stage of the cascade of failures in network a , all the support inter - links from network b are considered functioning . at each stage ,",
    "the nodes which do not have any support inter - links from the other network , and the nodes which are separated from the giant component of the network , are considered to have failed .",
    "this process will continue until no further node failure in either network occurs .    .",
    "curves represent intra - links within the network , while arrows ( directed links ) represent the inter - links connecting a support node in one network to the dependent node in the other network . among the total 12 directed links ,",
    "half of them @xmath26 represent the support from nodes in network b to nodes in network a ( arrow from nodes in network b to nodes in network a ) .",
    "the rest @xmath27 links represent the support from nodes in network a to nodes in network b. the support - dependent relations between nodes in network a and network b are random .",
    "initially , the attack is on node @xmath28 ( shown in red ) in network a and node @xmath29 ( shown in red ) in network b. the failed nodes are removed from the plot . in the first stage of the cascade of failures in network",
    "a , @xmath28 fails because of removal , node @xmath30 fails because of it has no support inter - links , @xmath31 and @xmath32 fail because of separation from the giant component of network a. all the failed nodes will lead to failures of inter - links starting from them . since we assume that the attack on network a occurs before that on network b , the inter - link from @xmath29 to @xmath33 is considered to be functional . in the first stage of the cascade of failures in network b , we first remove inter - links connecting network b to non - giant - component nodes in network a ( @xmath34 to @xmath28 , @xmath35 to @xmath31 , @xmath36 to @xmath30 ) .",
    "next , node @xmath29 fails because of the attack and nodes @xmath37 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 also fail because of no support .",
    "@xmath34 fails because it becomes separated from the giant component ( nodes @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) of network b. finally , after removing inter - links connecting from network a to non - giant - component nodes in network b ( @xmath40 to @xmath34 , @xmath41 to @xmath34 and @xmath33 to @xmath29 ) , the coupled network system reaches a stable state after one step in the cascade of failures , since all nodes in both giant components are connected and each node have at least one support node from the other network . , width=642 ]",
    "the stable state of the two stable connected giant components in both networks are usually reached after several stages in the cascade of failures . we define @xmath42 and @xmath43 as the average number of support inter - links remaining in the stage @xmath44 of the cascade of failures of network a and network b respectively .    in each stage of the cascade of failures ,",
    "we analyze first network a then network b. such a procedure does not have any affect on the final result of the failure cascade .",
    "while considering network a at stage @xmath44 , we assume all the inter - links ( @xmath45 ) from network b to network a of the previous stage are working . when considering network b at stage @xmath44 , we use the updated @xmath46 after the @xmath44th stage of network a.    since , in our model we randomly set up @xmath4 inter - links from network a to network b and @xmath17 inter - links from network b to network a , the degree distributions of inter - links of both networks follow poisson statistics .",
    "there exist nodes in network a and network b without support initially ( nodes @xmath30 and @xmath37 in fig.1 ) .",
    "these nodes are regarded as failed and need to be considered in addition to the random removal of nodes .    at stage 1 , after removal of a fraction @xmath20 of nodes in network a , taking into account also the nodes with zero inter - links at stage 0 , the result is equivalent to a random removal of a fraction @xmath47 of nodes in network a. the giant component of network a will constitute a fraction @xmath48 of the remaining @xmath49 nodes of network a. thus , the fraction @xmath50 of the giant component with respect to the @xmath0 , the original size of network a , is @xmath51 since we assume that all support links from network b exist , we use @xmath18 .    the failures of @xmath52 nodes in network a will lead to failures of support inter - links from network a to network b. the working support inter - links from network a to network b , @xmath53 , will decrease from @xmath19 to @xmath54 .",
    "next , at the first stage of cascade of failures in network b , a fraction @xmath21 of nodes in network b will fail because of the initial attack . combining this fraction with the fraction of nodes in network b having zero degree of support links after the first stage of cascade of failures in network a",
    ", the joint effect is equivalent to a random removal of a fraction @xmath55 of nodes in network b. the giant component of network b will constitute a fraction @xmath56 of @xmath57 nodes .",
    "thus the fraction of the giant component of network b after the 1st stage of cascade of failures is @xmath58 the number of support links @xmath59 then will be reduced from @xmath18 to @xmath60 .    the 2nd stage of the cascade of failures in network a is equivalent to the first stage in network a with the updated @xmath61 replacing @xmath18 .",
    "accordingly , the 2nd stage of cascade failures in network b is equivalent to the first stage in network b with the updated @xmath62 . during the cascade of failures , @xmath42 and @xmath43 decrease as @xmath44 increases .    in general , the @xmath44th stage of the cascade in network a is equivalent to the 1st stage of the cascade in network a with @xmath18 replaced by @xmath45 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath44th stage of the cascade in network b is equivalent to the 1st stage of the cascade in network b with @xmath63 replaced @xmath46 .",
    "the general forms of the giant components of both networks at stage @xmath44 of the cascade of failures can be expressed as @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the equivalent fractions of nodes in network a and network b respectively after random removal , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the fractions of the giant components in the remaining @xmath65 and @xmath66 fraction of nodes .",
    "the key to the analytical solution of this process is to find the way how @xmath42 and @xmath43 decrease with the cascade stage @xmath44 .",
    "next , we will use the apparatus of generating functions @xcite to derive the analytical forms of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the generating functions of the degree distribution @xmath14 of network a and @xmath15 of network b are @xmath71 analogously , the generating functions of the underlying branching processes are @xmath72 after random removal of a fraction @xmath73 of nodes , the remaining @xmath74 fraction of the network will have different degree distribution . the new generation functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 will be @xcite @xmath77    randomly connecting @xmath78 support links from network b to network a , the degree distribution of the inter - links in network a follows a poisson distribution with average degree @xmath59 @xmath79^k}{k ! } e^{-c^{ba}}.\\ ] ] similar , for network b , @xmath80^k}{k ! } e^{-c^{ab}}.\\ ] ] during the process of the cascade of failures , because the support - dependent relations are uncorrelated with the network properties of network a and network b , @xmath81 and @xmath82 will remain poisson distributions with the new @xmath43 and @xmath42 , which decrease as @xmath44 increases .    initially , there will be a fraction @xmath83 of nodes in network a which do not have any support links from network b. since the attack on the @xmath20 fraction of nodes from network a is random , there will be overlap between the attack and the initially not working nodes ( without support links ) in network a. the joint effect is equivalent to a random removal of a fraction @xmath84 of nodes in network a. what happens in network b is similar to network a with @xmath85 replaced by @xmath86 and @xmath59 replaced by @xmath53 .",
