    "shear alfvn waves ( saw ) are electromagnetic plasma waves propagating as transverse waves along the magnetic field , with the characteristic alfvn velocity @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the magnetic field and @xmath3 the mass density of the plasma ) . in fusion plasmas , fast ions in the mev energy range have velocities comparable with the typical alfvn speed . in addition , saw group velocity is directed along the magnetic field line and , therefore , fast ions can stay in resonance and effectively exchange energy with the wave  @xcite . saw in a nonuniform equilibrium experience collisionless dissipation ( _ continuum damping _",
    "@xcite ) , due to singular structures that are formed where the saw continuum is resonantly excited . in tokamaks ,",
    "the magnetic field intensity varies along the field line .",
    "this creates gaps in the saw continuous spectrum  @xcite due to translational symmetry breaking , analogous to electrons traveling in a periodic lattice  @xcite .",
    "two types of collective shear alfvn instabilities exist in tokamak plasmas : energetic - particle continuum modes ( epm )  @xcite , with frequency determined by fast particle characteristic motions , and discrete alfvn eigenmodes ( ae ) , with a frequency inside saw continuum gaps  @xcite .",
    "the former can become unstable provided the drive exceeds a threshold determined by the continuum damping absorption ; the latter , have a generally lower instability threshold , being practically unaffected by continuum damping  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the importance of understanding the continuum radial structure is clear , if one faces the problem of reaching the ignition condition with magnetically confined fusion plasmas , due to the potential impact of ae stability on the plasma confinement .",
    "the nonlinear dynamics of saw is a research topic still rich of open issues . in the special case of uniform ideal incompressible plasmas a peculiar state exists , called the _ alfvnic state _",
    "@xcite , where the nonlinear effects due to maxwell and reynolds stresses cancel and give a self - consistent nonlinear state .",
    "on the other hand , in tokamak plasmas , nonuniformities and non - ideal effects such as resistivity or finite plasma compressibility are present .",
    "this breaks the alfvnic state conditions and therefore saw are characterized by a rich nonlinear dynamics . as a consequence , the saw continuous spectrum can be modified by the interaction with low - frequency mhd fluctuations  @xcite , such as magnetic islands .",
    "magnetic islands are the result of magnetic - field reconnection processes , which occur in tokamak plasmas because of non ideal effects , such as finite resistivity  @xcite .",
    "the typical island oscillation frequency and growth rate are much lower than the saw frequency . due to this time scale separation between island and the saw dynamics ,",
    "the island is modelled here as a static helical distortion of the equilibrium .",
    "we derive our fluid theoretical description of the saw continuum structure inside a finite size magnetic island in finite-@xmath4 tokamak plasmas .",
    "the magnetic island is modelled here as a straight flux tube with a noncircular cross section .",
    "therefore , we neglect toroidicity effects on coupling modes with different poloidal mode numbers . however , we do take account the low - frequency gap in the saw continuum due to the effects of geodesic curvature and finite compressibility  @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the coupling of saw and the island magnetic perturbation is a linear problem of saw dynamics in a modified static equilibrium .",
    "the local differential equation yielding the saw continuum structure is solved numerically with a shooting method code , in the spatial range of interest inside the magnetic island  @xcite .",
    "we are interested here in modes with different helicity from that of the magnetic island ; in other words , we assume @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the coordinate along the flux tube . the solution of this problem inside and outside the magnetic island , for modes with the same helicity of the magnetic island , is given in a different paper  @xcite .",
    "as suggested by the magnetic field line helicity behavior  @xcite , in an equilibrium with a magnetic island a generalized safety factor @xmath0 can be defined for each flux surface , as an appropriate average of the ratio of the magnetic field components along and perpendicular to the magnetic axis .",
    "this safety factor is a monotone function of the distance from the o point , and grows towards the separatrix , where it has a singularity .",
    "this is due to the vanishing of the magnetic field intensity near the x point of the magnetic island . within the separatrix",
    ", we find a continuous spectrum very similar to that of tokamak plasmas , where the coupling of modes with different mode numbers creates frequency gaps .",
    "in particular , a wide frequency gap is formed  @xcite , analogous to the ellipticity induced alfvn eigenmode  @xcite ( eae ) gap in tokamaks",
    ". the presence of this gap is due to the strong eccentricity of the island cross section . in this gap ,",
    "a magnetic - island induced alfvn eigenmode ( miae ) could exist as a bound state , essentially free of continuum damping , and interact nonlinearly with the magnetic island , if the thermal or energetic component of the plasma provide sufficient free energy for driving the mode .",
    "due to the frequency dependence of the shear alfvn wave continuum on the magnetic - island size , the possibility of utilizing miae frequency scalings as a novel magnetic island diagnostic is also discussed .",
    "the scheme of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : equilibrium - coordinates ] we describe the equilibrium magnetic field , starting with the tokamak coordinates and introducing the cylinderlike coordinates for the magnetic island flux tube .",
    "the generalized safety factor defined inside the magnetic island , is shown to have similar behavior of the safety factor in diverted tokamaks . in sec .",
    "[ sec : continuous - spectrum ] , the saw model equations are introduced and the equation for general shear alfvn modes is provided .",
    "the equation for continuum modes is then derived in the cylinderlike coordinate set defined inside the island and the eigenvalue problem is established .",

    "we consider a tokamak geometry where @xmath7 is the major radius of the torus .",
    "the equilibrium is made of an axisymmetric tokamak magnetic field , plus a helical perturbation generating the magnetic island .",
    "we start our analysis by describing the axisymmetric field with an orthogonal coordinate system @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the radial coordinate , @xmath10 is the poloidal angle , corresponding to the field @xmath11 , and @xmath12 the toroidal angle , corresponding to the toroidal field @xmath13 , considered uniform for simplicity .",

    "@xmath23 is the tokamak safety factor @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the inverse aspect ratio , assumed to be small : @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , we introduce an orthogonal coordinate system @xmath27 through a rotation in the ( @xmath28 ) plane , defining @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this is appropriate to describe a sheared field problem , in the proximity of the rational surface , because the axisymmetric magnetic field is directed only along @xmath31 at @xmath32 .",

    "typical magnetic islands in tokamak experiments have eccentricities close to @xmath81 .",
    "the case of zero eccentricity corresponds to a value of magnetic island width , which is never encountered in tokamak plasmas because a saturation or a disruption occurs long before the island grows up to these sizes .",

    "[ fig : m - small ] , is the same as for @xmath163 , but in this case we obtain a much wider miae gap .",

    "one of the main damping mechanisms of saw instabilities in nonuniform plasmas is continuum damping , which occurs near the magnetic flux surfaces where the frequency of the instability matches the saw continuum frequency .",
