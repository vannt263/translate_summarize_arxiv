    "@xcite , the only way to affect the surface li abundance is to convectively mix li down to regions where it can burn . however , during the main sequence lifetime of f stars , the surface convection zone ( scz ) occupies only a small fraction ( by mass ) of the li preservation region ( * ? ? ?",

    "overshoot ages are 25% larger than ages without overshoot ; lithium - test ages are even larger ( see * ? ? ?",
    "] , the standard model predicts no li depletion in f stars .",
    "indeed , f stars in the pleiades and other young clusters themselves show no significant li depletion , suggesting that pre - ms li depletion in these stars , if any , must also have been small .",
    "it came as a surprise , therefore , when @xcite discovered that f stars in the hyades ( 700@xmath350 myr ) had dramatically depleted their surface li abundances .",
    "it was immediately clear that additional physical mechanisms beyond those usually included in the standard theory were required to explain this phenomenon .",
    "subsequent studies of open cluster li and be abundances are revealing a rich variety of stellar li depletion properties , almost",
    "_ none _ of which can be accounted for by the standard theory @xcite .",
    "it is thus becoming increasingly important to ascertain what physical mechanisms are really operating inside low mass stars , especially since there may be critical implications for interpreting and testing big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite and globular cluster ages @xcite .",
    "three classes of models have emerged as possible explanations for the f dwarf li gap : 1 ) diffusion @xcite , where gravitational settling and thermal diffusion drain li out of the scz and surface , 2 ) steady main sequence mass loss ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  ssd  ) , where the li preservation region is simply lost over time ( though the required mass loss rates are enormous ) , and 3 ) slow mixing driven by instabilities associated with rotation ( * ? ? ?",

    "rotationally - induced mixing could include meridional circulation and related instabilities , and/or instabilities triggered by angular momentum loss . to continue to try to differentiate between these scenarios we pursue here the novel approach of investigating the differences in the predicted morphology of the li gap in its early ( and heretofore uninvestigated ) stages .",

    "nearly all ms86 members in the range @xmath8 were observed . each star was exposed for a total of about 5 hours , yielding s / n per 0.2  pixel of 100300 in the co - added spectra .",

    "an empirical relation was made between the @xmath10 color of the fiducial single - star sequence and the other colors ( @xmath11 ) , and an effective @xmath10 was calculated for each .",

    "the error in w(li ) , @xmath22 , is derived using the relation from @xcite , and depends on the s / n and fwhm of each li line .",

    "the reported @xmath25 in table 1 has contributions from @xmath22 and @xmath26 , added in quadrature .",
    "systematic errors due to @xmath27 and the @xmath1 scale itself may be at least as large as 100k , but since they would affect the whole ensemble in essentially the same ( small ) way , they do not affect our conclusions .    following the initial selection of @xmath28 ms86 members ,",
    "stars were rejected if , a ) they are photometric nonmembers in _ any _ of our six cmd s , b ) they are radial velocity non - members from our spectra or from those spectra used in the @xmath29 study , or c ) they appear to be probable binaries based on a photometric and spectroscopic analyses .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath21 as a function of @xmath1 for the pleiades , m35 ( this study ) , and the hyades .",
    "m35 data from bds01 are also shown .",
    "all data from the literature have been reanalyzed using our methods and photometry , where available , to give the most consistent picture possible .",
    "several aspects of the li@xmath1 morphology in m35 are worthy of notice .",
    "first , it is clear that , as compared to the nominal upper bound plateau between 6300 and 6800k with a(li ) = 3.2 , many stars between 6000 and 6700 k ( or beyond ) have depleted their surface li abundances . although a small amount of li depletion can not be ruled out for the pleiades , the li gap has _",
    "definitely _ begun to form in m35 .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in figure 2 , which shows the continuum - normalized spectra in the li region for four pairs of stars .",
    "the stars in each pair have similar @xmath1 , and thus it is not surprising that their fe i and ca i line strengths ( which depend primarily on @xmath1 and intrinsic abundance ) are identical ; the li abundances , however , are strikingly disparate .",
    "( note that where necessary , spectra of slowly rotating stars were artificially broadened to match their pair . )",
    "although the errors listed in table 1 are internal ( see  2 ) , we stress again that systematic errors due to uncertainties in @xmath27 or @xmath1 scale do not affect a differential analysis of stars at the same @xmath1 .",
    "formally , the li differences are significant at the @xmath30 level ; the depth of the depletion far exceeds our errors .",
    "the upper and lower envelope of stars in the gap region of m35 differ by more than 0.5 dex , which corresponds to to a factor of more than 3 in abundance ( and in line strength ) .",
    "thus , m35 illustrates that the li gap begins to form early .",
    "second , the li depletion region is quite wide in teff .",
    "the same four pairs illustrate that its width exceeds 700k ( from 6000 to 6700k+ ) , which is clearly wider than the canonical hyades li gap ( the region 6550 - 6700k that contains the most extreme hyad depletions ) .",
    "but perhaps this canonical hyades gap should be viewed as being part of a wider depletion structure : after all , hyad li abundances in the region 6300 - 6550k show li dispersions of about 1 dex and are , themselves , depleted by up to 1 dex or more .",
    "note also the highly overdepleted hyad at a(li )  1.5,6000k in thorburn et al .",
    "furthermore , it can be argued that although praesepe has the same age as the hyades , its li gap ( or , more generally , f dwarf li depletion region ) is also quite wide , with dramatic depletion seen all the way from 5900 to 6700k ( soderblom et al .",
    "1993b ) . and , like the hyades , praesepe has a star near a(li )  1.5 , 6000k",
    ". it may be the case that wide li gaps are more typical than the narrower one in the hyades , even if that one is extended from 6300k to 6700k as we propose here .",
    "third , in m35 , the full @xmath1 range from 6000 to 6700k shows both undepleted ( or minimally depleted ) stars as well as depleted ones .",
    "by contrast , the hyades li gap has no star with @xmath31 in the @xmath1 range 6350 - 6650k , and praesepe has just a few high - li stars in its gap .",
    "also , the bottom of the m35 li depletion region ( gap ? ) seems fairly uniform from 6000 to 6600k ( though note the two upper limits at 6500k )",
    ". does the blue side of the gap typically deplete more precipitously later on , as perhaps suggested by the hyades , or does significant depletion continue throughout a wider teff region , as perhaps suggested by praesepe ? is the hyades typical or unusual ?",
    "data from additional ( rich ) clusters are needed to address this issue .",
    "all of the results discussed above strongly support models of stellar evolution that include rotationally induced mixing , while arguing against diffusion and mass loss . in the yale rotational models where mixing is in part driven by angular momentum loss , li dispersions at fixed @xmath1 are a natural consequence of the fact that stars form with a distribution of initial angular momenta ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "stars with larger @xmath32 will eventually lose more angular momentum and deplete more li .",
    "figure 3 shows the rotational models of dp97 ( solid lines ) and the diffusion models of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter rm93 , dashed lines ; both interpolated slightly to an age of 150myr ) as compared to our m35 li data .",
    "the general morphology of the wide gap is well - reproduced by the dp97 model predictions , and a reasonable distribution in @xmath32 produces exactly the degree of dispersion that is observed .",
    "both minimally depleted and more significantly depleted stars are predicted throughout the gap region .",
    "note the suggestion from the models that the upper bound plateau at a(li)=3.2 might itself be slightly depleted .",
    "this is consistent with the apparently slightly higher upper bound in the pleiades , although galactic li evolution might also create slight differences in the initial cluster a(li ) .",
    "some predictions of the rotational models of c94 are similar to those of dp97 ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite improved c94 s treatment of angular momentum transport by wind - driven meridional circulation and shear turbulence and concluded that they could explain the hot side ( @xmath33 ) of the li gap and other abundance anomalies in more massive stars ; however , they overdepleted li in stars cooler than 6700k .",
    "@xcite argue that it is plausible that in these cooler stars angular momentum transport is dominated instead by gravity waves ( and not magnetic fields ) , which have less associated mixing ( and li depletion ) .",
    "note that a distribution in @xmath32 still leads to a spread in a(li ) .",
    "we call for the construction of detailed models to see whether this interesting approach can reproduce the features of the young m35 li depletion features discovered here ( and of course numerous other li / be / b patterns observed in low mass stars ) .",
    "diffusion theory has difficulty explaining several aspects of our m35 observations .",
    "first , the depth of li depletion is greater than the predictions of the rm93 diffusion models which , for m35 , predict a maximum depth of only 0.3 dex , while we observe depletion of 0.6 dex or more .",
    "the more recent diffusion models of @xcite include complicating effects of turbulence but this tends to dilute the effects of diffusion .",
    "the rm93 models also predict a unique li abundance at a given @xmath1 , in obvious disagreement with the observations presented here .",
    "while one might imagine parameters in the models that could change from star to star to modulate the effects of diffusion , no such parameter has been suggested or explicitly modeled by the studies mentioned above .",
    "what is most troublesome for diffusion is the overall morphology of the li depletion seen in m35 . at 150 myr",
    ", the diffusion li gap of rm93 has its maximum depletion occur at 6900k , and is very narrow , with a half width of about 100k .",
    "our data show significant depletion over more than 700k , and extending as cool as 6000k .",
    "( rm93 also acknowledge that their models do nt reproduce the hyades gap very well . )",
    "diffusion can not be the dominant mechanism forming the li gap .",
    "similarly , mass loss can not be responsible for the depletion seen in figure 1 . in order to strip away the entire li preservation region of f stars of the 700 myr hyades cluster , ssd report that mass loss rates are required that are more than 10,000 times the current mass loss rate of the sun . in order to make this proposal viable ,",
    "they conjectured that pulsationally unstable @xmath34 scuti stars might be responsible for such high rates , but these stars are only thought to extend as cool as about 6900k , so the coolest @xmath34 scuti is hotter than the hottest li gap star . with the discovery of significant depletion of li in m35",
    ", these mass loss rates must be even higher , and the depletors at 6000k can not possibly be explained by @xmath34 scuti stars .",
    "it is worth noting that even if not dominant , diffusion may yet play a role in affecting light element abundances of solar - type stars , since it is expected to occur in sufficiently stable radiative layers .",
    "indeed , helioseismology suggests the action of ( downward ) helium diffusion @xcite , and the super - li rich `` li peak '' dwarf j37 of ngc 6633 reveals the action of ( upwards ) li diffusion ( dsj02 , but see * ? ? ?",
    "1 , just hotter than the a(li)=3.2 upper bound plateau extending from 6300 to 6800k , note the four stars with a(li)@xmath43.3 between 6900 and 7200k .",
    "it is conceivable that these somewhat high a(li ) might somehow be related to upwards diffusion ; however , the rm93-predicted peak is not as wide as 300k , and the li - depleted stars in the same @xmath1 range would require a different explanation .",
    "finally , although it is becoming increasingly clear that slow mixing affects the radiative layers below the sczs of low mass stars , the challenge remains to decipher what combination of specific physical mechanisms are at work .",
    "we conclude that the study of the timing and morphology of the formation of of the li gap provides a powerful new method to study the physical mechanisms occuring inside stars .",
    "results from applying this method to m35 join a variety of other evidence that points to the action of slow mixing in low mass stars , including the li - be depletion correlation @xcite , higher li in short period tidally locked binaries (  sptlbs  , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , moderately rapid li depletion in m67 subgiants @xcite , the existence of a moderate be gap @xcite though ( so far ) no b gap @xcite , the continued depletion of li during the main sequence @xcite , and the li dispersions at fixed @xmath1 ( thorburn et al . ;",
