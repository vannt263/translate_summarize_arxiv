    "cepheus  b ( cep  b ) is a molecular core located at the edge of the cepheus giant molecular cloud at a distance around 725  pc and lying @xmath11 above the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "a handful of embedded young stars were found in cep  b from radio continuum and infrared ( ir ) studies @xcite . the unobscured stellar ob association cep  ob3 lies around cep  b ; the younger subgroup , cep  ob3b , lies closest to the cloud as shown in figure [ fig_map ] @xcite . for many years",
    ", the cep  ob3 association has been considered to be a good example of large - scale sequential star formation in accord with the model of @xcite where stellar winds and supernova remnants of an older stellar cluster compress and trigger a second generation of star formation in nearby molecular cloud cores @xcite .",
    "the interface between the molecular cloud and the cep  ob3b star association is clearly delineated by the optically bright hii region sharpless 155 ( s  155 ) , where cloud material is ionized and heated by the radiation field of the o7 star hd  217086 , b1 star hd  217061 and perhaps other cluster members @xcite . figure [ fig_map ] shows the spatial relationship of the cloud , hii region , and exciting stars . unlike in the orion nebula where the hii region lies between the cloud and ourselves , the photodissociation region at s  155 is favorably oriented to reveal the progression of star formation . following the triggered star formation model , we expect the surface of the cloud to be eroded by the early - type stars so that the cloud edge moves eastward across the observer s field of view with new stars emerging from the obscuring molecular cloud .",
    "sources located within but near the edge of the molecular cloud would represent a new generation of star formation triggered by the hii region shock propagating into the cloud .",
    "this scenario of triggered star formation has been recently strengthened by the discovery using the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ of @xmath12 lightly - obscured low - mass pre - main sequence ( pms ) members of the cep  ob3b cluster located outside of the cloud , and a rich population of @xmath13 pms stars in the cluster embedded within cep  b @xcite .",
    "x - ray surveys are particularly effective in discriminating disk - free pms populations from galactic field stars which often badly contaminate infrared ( ir ) surveys of young stellar clusters ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using 2mass counterparts of the x - ray sources , @xcite found that pms stars in the embedded cluster are more likely ( 26% @xmath14 4% ) to have @xmath15-band excesses from heated inner protoplanetary disks than stars in the unobscured cep  ob3 region .",
    "this supports both , youthfulness of the embedded cep  b population and the prevalence of planet forming disks in the embedded cluster .",
    "we seek here to elucidate the relationships of disks and environments in this region using mid - ir photometry from the _ spizer space telescope _ which is exceptionally well - suited for detecting disks around low - mass members of young clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "measures of disk fractions as functions of stellar mass and age in different star - forming environments can provide better understanding of the evolution of circumstellar disks in different environments and thus have direct astrophysical importance in evaluating the conditions for planet formation .",
    "x - ray pms selection is very complementary to ir surveys . as x - ray emission from pms stars",
    "is based on enhanced solar - type magnetic reconnection events rather than disk or accretion processes , x - ray selection delivers rich and clean samples of diskless stars missed by ir selection @xcite .",
    "the x - ray stars identified by @xcite in combination with discovered here @xmath8 disk - bearing stars constitute a valuable sample to measure protoplanetary disk properties in different radiative environments and to study the triggering process inside the cep  b molecular cloud .",

    "roughly half of these lie in the interface region between the cep  b molecular cloud and s  155 hii region where the irac point source sensitivity is reduced by the high background nebular emission from heated dust ( figure [ fig_map ] ) .",
    "these are probably true cluster members , but are omitted from the science analysis below . the other half of these unidentified x - ray sources is uniformly distributed outside of the cep  b cloud with weak x - ray fluxes and high x - ray median energies consistent with extragalactic background sources .",

    "@xcite also provide useful empirical templates of median seds of ic  348 pms stars for each evolutionary class .",
    "we proceed with the disk classifications through the comparison of the observed cepheus seds in @xmath63irac ir bands to the ( de)reddened median sed templates of ic  348 pms stellar photospheres .",
    "we further confirm these classifications through calculations of the sed slope @xmath54 , and locations in irac color - color diagrams .",
    "results of our disk classification are shown in table  [ tbl2 ] .      first , a rough estimate of individual stellar masses of the cepheus pms stars is made by de - reddening star positions in the @xmath64 versus @xmath65 color - magnitude diagram to the @xmath66  myr and @xmath67  myr theoretical isochrons for the cep  ob3b / s  155 and cep  b subregions , respectively , based on the models of @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",

    "these individual stellar photometric mass and extinction estimates are listed in table [ tbl2 ] .",
    "although individual mass estimates may be subject to significant uncertainties and may not be always compatible with masses obtained by more accurate methods such as optical spectroscopy , this approach should be adequate to assign an ic  348 sed template ( table  4 of * ? ? ?",

    "second , it is important to note that the ic  348 template seds are observed ( not de - reddened ) and exhibit an extinction of @xmath68  mag @xcite .",
    "thus for each of the cepheus stars , an ic  348 template sed at the corresponding spectral sub - class is first reddened and de - reddened within the wide but finite range of extinctions using reddening relationships described in appendix  a for @xmath69 and @xcite for irac bands .",

    "based on the membership analysis of @xcite , 24 x - ray sources without ir counterparts are possible extragalactic contaminants ( `` exg '' ) and 13 are foreground candidates ( `` frg '' ) .",
    "forty chandra sources with ir detections which are unreliable or insufficient for classification have an uncertain classification ( `` unc '' ) .",
    "we further subjectively classify 20 stars as class  ii / iii transition disks ( labelled as `` td '' and `` dsk '' ) ; these follow the photospheric sed at wavelengths shorter than at least @xmath71 m .",

    "first , the cepheus histogram shows a bimodal distribution with peaks at @xmath76 and @xmath77 corresponding to disk - bearing and diskless star samples , respectively .",

    "comparison of @xmath8-irac source positions in the @xmath82 - [ 4.5]$ ] @xmath14 @xmath83 - [ 8.0]$ ] diagram with the results of models of stars with dusty disks and envelopes led @xcite and @xcite to propose this diagram as an excellent tool for pms classification .",

    "the o7vn star hd  217086 star is probably the principal ionization source but other ob stars ( figure [ fig_map ] ) , including the b1vn star hd  217061 currently located within the sw zone of the s  155 subregion , probably also play a role . if the original cloud were only slightly larger than the size observed today , the rdi shock would have slowly propagated through @xmath9  pc of the cep  b molecular cloud over @xmath94  myr years , implying a shock velocity around @xmath177  km  s@xmath93 .",
    "the stars formed early in this process would have drifted @xmath180 ( @xmath181  pc ) in all directions , populating much of the @xmath7 field of view with triggered stars .",
    "such star drifting would require a stellar velocity dispersion around 1  km  s@xmath93 .",
    "this is expected from the turbulent velocities within a cloud several parsecs in extent @xcite , which can be supplemented by dynamical interactions between protostars during star formation @xcite .",

    "a similar fast shock speed is observed in the triggered star formation in the molecular pillars of the eagle nebula ( m  16 ) and other bright rimmed clouds @xcite , and is consistent with the theoretical models of @xcite .",
    "a critical discriminant between these scenarios is the sfe of the cloud . integrating the stellar masses in figure  [ fig_imf ] , the total stellar mass of the cep  ob3b disk - bearing population assuming a standard galactic field imf is @xmath184  m@xmath5 in our observed field . with the average disk fraction of @xmath185 (  [ mass_domain_subsection ] , table  [ tbl_frac ] ) , we add @xmath186  m@xmath91 of diskfree stars and @xmath187  m@xmath91 from hd  217086 to give a total mass of the cep  ob3b population around @xmath188  m@xmath5 .",

    "this supports the second scenario involving a fast shock passing through a much larger and more massive original cloud .",
    "two other aspects of rdi triggered star formation can be discussed .",
    "first , @xcite provided observational evidence for a non - standard imf where intermediate - mass stars are preferentially formed over lower mass stars in brcs . in the case of the embedded triggered pms population of ic  1396n , @xcite also found indications for a nonstandard imf biased towards higher mass stars , but cautioned about possible observation selection effects .",
    "a similar situation arises here in the case of the embedded cep  b population (  [ imf_subsection ] ) .",
    "while the shape of the cep  b stellar mass distribution is not definite yet , the stellar mass distribution of likely rdi triggered stellar population of the cep  ob3b / s  155 region agrees well with a standard galactic imf , at least down to @xmath193  m@xmath5 (  [ imf_subsection ] ) .",
    "second , most theoretical calculations of rdi triggering involve small globules and a single episode of triggering .",
    "the @xmath17  myr range of stellar ages found in the cep  b / cep  ob3b region , and an even wider age spread found in cg  12 @xcite , implies repeated or continuing star formation over millions of years when the rdi mechanism occurs in a larger molecular cloud .",
    "we present a @xmath8 irac observation of the cepheus  b molecular cloud , the s  155 hii region on its periphery , and a portion of the nearby cep  ob3b ob association .",
    "the goals of this work are to study disk evolution of the nearly disk - unbiased combined @xmath7-acis and @xmath8-irac selected samples of pms stars and to provide new clues of the sequential triggered star formation process in the region .    out of @xmath0 x - ray emitting pms stars in the region , 354 are classified as diskless or disk - bearing stars based on ir photometry : 161 , 36 , and 18 ( 75 , 26 , and 38 ) diskless ( disk - bearing ) stars in the cep  ob3b , s  155 , and cep  b subregions , respectively .",
    "we immediately see that samples selecting only ir - excess stars miss the majority of stars outside the cep  b molecular core . among all x - ray emitting disk - bearing systems , only 4 are class  i protostars ; they lie in the younger embedded cep  b cluster (  [ yso_classification_section ] ) .",

    "early photometric age estimates of the ob population indicated a relatively old cluster around @xmath198  myr @xcite .",

    "it is unclear from any of these earlier datasets whether the age is uniform across the region .",
    "we seek here to estimate stellar ages from the @xmath199- and @xmath200-band color - magnitude diagram for the @xmath7 x - ray pms stars using the photometry of @xcite listed in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the @xmath48 near - ir photometry was first used with the combination of the synthesized @xcite ( for @xmath202  m@xmath5 ) and @xcite ( for @xmath203  m@xmath5 ) pms evolutionary isochrones to obtain individual extinction estimates for @xmath7 sources .",
    "we obtained different sets of source extinctions ( @xmath204 ) using the @xmath64 versus @xmath65 color - magnitude diagram ( similar to the one shown in figure 5 of * ? ? ? * ) with two trial assumed distances ( 725 and 850  pc ) and three trial assumed ages ( 1 , 2 , and 3  myr ) .",

    "mag and @xmath207  mag at @xmath208  mag adopted by @xcite and the reddening laws of @xcite , we used the reddening relationships @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 .",
    "the cep  b optical stars have an average extinction @xmath212  mag while s  155 stars have @xmath213  mag and cep  ob3b stars have @xmath214  mag . within each of the areas , the extinctions of disk - bearing stars",
    "are systematically higher than those of diskless stars .",
    "as the inferred visual source extinctions differ by @xmath215  mag for the six trial combinations of distance and age , and the reddening vector on the optical color - magnitude diagram is almost parallel to the pms evolutionary tracks , the x - ray sources occupy very similar loci in the @xmath205 color - magnitude diagram for all six cases .",
    "the x - ray sources are centered mostly around the @xmath94  myr isochrons assuming the distance of 725  pc , or the @xmath132  myr isochrone assuming the distance of 850  pc .",
    "figure  [ fig_cmd ] shows the color - magnitude diagram for 725  pc .",
    "the plotted symbols stratify the 286 x - ray sources with optical photometry according to location in the star forming region and the presence of disks : 62 disk - bearing ( 143 diskless ) , 22 disk - bearing ( 31 diskless ) , and 17 disk - bearing ( 11 diskless ) for the cep  ob3b , s  155 , and cep  b subregions , respectively .    in figure",
    "[ fig_cmd ] , about thirty x - ray sources have @xmath216 locations inconsistent with any pms model tracks .",
    "these outliers are not foreground or background stellar contaminants , as more than half of them have optically thick disks and very few field stars are predicted to be captured in the @xmath7 image .",
    "most of these outliers have unusually high near - ir extinctions @xmath204 among the x - ray young stars seen in the optical bands . for the majority of the outliers , the @xmath204 values are comparable ( within @xmath217 ) to the absorption @xmath218 inferred from the x - ray median energy , @xmath219 .",
    "@xmath219 is first converted to equivalent hydrogen column density assuming solar abundances using the @xmath220 relation found for the coup sample @xcite , and @xmath221 is converted to @xmath218 assuming a gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath222  @xmath223mag @xcite .",
    "this may point to discrepant optical magnitudes and/or unusual conditions in these pms systems ; for example , some may posses disk at high inclination where the optical light is enhanced by scattering above the disk .",
    "alternatively , these outliers may have ages overestimated by incorrect consideration of birth line and accretion effects ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    from a comparison of soft x - ray absorptions and fractions of @xmath224-band excess sources , @xcite presented evidence that the embedded cep  b cluster is younger than the cep  ob3b population within the @xmath7 acis - i field .",
    "figure  [ fig_cmd ] supports this age difference .",
    "ignoring outliers mentioned above , about half of the cep  b sources ( blue symbols ) are located closer to the 1  myr track compared to only about one - sixth of the cep  ob3b ( red symbols ) .",
    "however , the cep  b sample is small because most of the x - ray selected members are embedded and do not have optical counterparts .",
    "the result supports the youthfulness of the cep  b population seen in the disk fraction discussed in   [ spatial_domain_subsection ] .",
    "we thus can not arrive at a clear conclusion on the distance to the star forming complex .",
    "however we do establish a dependence of the inferred average age on the assumed distance . in this paper , we adopt ( not derive ) a distance to the cep  b / cep  ob3b complex of 725  pc , supported by the recent vlbi parallax measurement of cep  a. we therefore adopt an age of @xmath17  myr for the cep  ob3b stars and @xmath171  myr for the embedded cep  b stars .",
    "if the distance is closer to 850  pc , the inferred ages would be decreased by @xmath176  myr .",
    "originally found by @xcite from rosat data , it is now empirically well - established that pms x - ray luminosities are strongly correlated with stellar mass , volume and surface area .",
    "the @xmath225 relationship extends over 3 orders of magnitude range in x - ray luminosity .",
    "the clearest relationships are seen in the _ chandra orion ultradeep project _ ( coup ) observation of the orion nebula cluster @xcite and in the _ xmm - newton extended survey of taurus _ ( xest , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the astrophysical cause of this relationship is poorly understood , but probably is due to saturation of the magnetic dynamo in the fully convective stellar interior or on the surface of pms stars .",
    "figure [ fig_lx_vs_mass ] shows the @xmath226 relationship for 222 unobscured cep  ob3b pms stars compared to 457 lightly - absorbed ( @xmath227  mag ) orion coup stars from @xcite . here , @xmath228 represents the quantity @xmath229 , the x - ray luminosity computed in the @xmath230  kev band and corrected for obscuration . a similar , roughly linear ,",
    "relationship is seen in the cep  ob3b sample , but somewhat flatter than the relationship present in the coup sample .",
    "this can be attributed to truncation effects : the cep  ob3b observation is complete to @xmath231 erg  s@xmath93 @xcite , while the coup observation is complete to @xmath232 erg  s@xmath93 .",
    "examination of figure  [ fig_lx_vs_mass ] shows that the cep  ob3b x - ray sample alone is nearly complete down to @xmath4  m@xmath5 and @xmath9  m@xmath5 for the class  iii and class  ii stars , respectively ( see figure [ fig_imf ] ) .",
    "much of the scatter in both relations can be attributed to errors in coup and cep  ob3 stellar masses ; less scatter is seen in the xest @xmath233 plot where masses are carefully evaluated from accurate spectroscopy .",
    "x - ray members of the embedded cep  b cluster show a similar @xmath234 relationship with the completeness limit above @xmath6  m@xmath5 .",
    "a second relationship between x - ray emission and accretion was originally found from @xmath7 hrc ( high resolution camera ) data @xcite and has been confirmed in the coup and xest samples .",
    "this is thought to arise from a suppression of time - integrated x - ray emission in accreting versus non - accreting pms systems .",
    "this is a more subtle effect than the x - ray dependence on mass with an amplitude of only a factor of @xmath132 within the @xmath235 range in pms x - ray luminosities @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical cause of the mild suppression of x - ray emission in accreting pms systems is also uncertain .",
    "preibisch et al .",
    "suggest that x - ray emission can not arise in magnetic field lines that are mass loaded with disk material .",
    "@xcite argue that the outer magnetosphere of accretors is stripped by interaction with the disk .",
    "@xcite propose that soft x - ray emission is attenuated by dense material in accretion columns .",
    "@xcite find indications of shorter x - ray flare durations in class  ii systems that may be due to distortion and destabilization of magnetic loop structures in accreting systems .",
    "this effect is shown in figure  [ fig_lx_vs_mass ] with running medians of accreting and non - accreting stars for the lightly - obscured cep  ob3b and coup samples .",
    "the running medians are calculated within a sliding window with width 0.3  dex in @xmath236 .",
    "the errors on medians are median absolute deviations ( see appendix  b of * ? ? ?",
    "the sample selections are not identical due to different x - ray sensitivity limits and due to different limited spectroscopic / photometric measurements in orion and cep  ob3b regions .",
    "we show with the * @xmath237 * symbol 62 cep  ob3b stars classified as disk - bearing ` dsk ' systems in   [ yso_classification_section ] , and 142 coup stars classified as active accretors having ca  ii 8542  @xmath238 line in emission with equivalent width of @xmath239 .",
    "the @xmath240 symbols indicate 160 cep  ob3b stars classified as diskless ` nod ' and 315 weakly accreting or non - accreting coup stars with absorption equivalent width of @xmath241 .",
    "thirteen cep  ob3b transition disk stars are marked by squares .",
    "the factor of @xmath132 offset between the accreting and non - accreting stars in the coup samples is clearly seen to be superposed on the dominant @xmath233 relationship , but the effect is only marginally present in the cep  ob3b sample .",
    "the weakness of the offset here can be attributed to two effects .",
    "first , the incompleteness at lower-@xmath228 values discussed above has a greater impact on the weaker-@xmath228 accreting stars than the stronger-@xmath228 non - accreting stars .",
    "second , due to the absence of a spectroscopic survey of cep  ob3b stars , we classify stars here using an infrared photometric disk indicator rather than a direct accretion indicator .",
    "it has been established within the coup sample that the presence of a disk itself does not suppress x - ray emission , but active accretion must be present @xcite .",
    "these two effects plausibly explain the less pronounced observed effect of the cep  ob3b class  ii x - ray emission suppression compared to that of the coup stars .",
