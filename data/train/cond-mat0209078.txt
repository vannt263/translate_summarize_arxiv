    "persistence , i.e. , the probability that a fluctuating field does not change sign upto time @xmath0 has been widely studied in recent years in the context of nonequilibrium systems@xcite . a wide variety of results , both theoretical and experimental , are available for pure systems . in contrast ,",
    "there have been very few studies of persistence in disordered systems .",
    "a notable exception is the study of persistence , theoretical@xcite as well as numerical@xcite , in disordered ising models . in this paper we study analytically the persistence in another disordered system namely the celebrated sinai model@xcite , but in the presence of an additional arbitrary drift .",
    "we show that as one varies the drift parameter , the disorder averaged persistence displays a wide variety of rich behaviors which undergo qualitative changes at certain special values of the drift .",
    "the sinai model@xcite is perhaps one of the simplest models of disordered systems where various disorder averaged physical quantities exhibit rich and nontrivial behaviors and yet , can be computed analytically@xcite .",
    "thus the sinai model serves the role of ` ising ' model in disordered systems . in this model a brownian particle undergoes diffusion in presence of a random time - independent potential .",
    "the position @xmath1 of the particle evolves via the langevin equation , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the thermal noise with @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the external potential . in the biased sinai model one",
    "considers the potential to be simply @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the trajectory of a brownian motion in space , i.e. , @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 represents the bias or the drift and @xmath13 measures the strength of the disorder .",
    "thus the particle is subjected , in addition to the thermal noise @xmath3 , an external position dependent random force @xmath14 .",
    "various physical quantities in the sinai model have been studied before@xcite . here",
    "our aim is to compute the persistence @xmath15 defined as the probability that the particle does not cross the origin upto time @xmath0 starting at the initial position @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "evidently this quantity will depend on the realization of the underlying disorder potential and will , in general , vary from one sample of disorder to another .",
    "our final goal is to compute the disorder averaged persistence @xmath18 as a function of both @xmath19 and @xmath0 for different values of the drift @xmath12 .",
    "physicists have recently studied the persistence in the sinai model using various methods which include an exact probabilistic approach suited for unbiased sinai model@xcite , a study of an equivalent lattice model with random hopping rates@xcite and also by employing a real space renormalization group method@xcite .",
    "all of these methods provide asymptotically exact results , but _ only in the limit of vanishing drift _ ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath20 . unfortunately , extension of these existing physical methods to extract explicit asymptotic results for arbitrary nonzero @xmath12 seems rather difficult .",
    "mathematicians , on the other hand , have studied some aspects of a related quantity namely the distribution of the first - passage time in the sinai model for nonzero drift and some rigorous results seem to exist@xcite . however , these mathematical methods are extremely technical and difficult to follow",
    ". what is lacking , so far , is a unified physical approach which , besides reproducing the known results in a simple and transparent way , provides exact asymptotic results for all @xmath12 and yet simple and powerful enough to be easily generalizable to other problems .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide such an approach .",
    "the heart of our approach lies in mapping the problem of computing the persistence in the sinai model with arbitrary drift to finding the spectrum of a single particle quantum hamiltonian , which can subsequently be done exactly .",
    "apart from presenting an unified approach valid for arbitrary drift , there are two other physical motivations for this work .",
    "first , it is well known that the sinai model displays a range of intereresting anomalous diffusion properties as one tunes the drift @xmath12 through certain finite ` critical ' values@xcite .",
    "it is therefore theoretically interesting to know how the persistence behaviour changes as the drift is varied through these ` critical ' values .",
    "secondly and perhaps more importantly , the sinai model with a nonzero drift has numerous physical applications@xcite including the diffusion of electrons in disordered medium in presence of an electric field , glassy dynamics of dislocations in solids , dynamics of random field magnets , dynamics near the helix - coil transitions in heteroploymers .",
    "the most recent application of the biased sinai model has been to understand the dynamics of denaturation of a single dna molecule under an external force@xcite .",
    "persistence seems to be a natural quantity to study in these systems and hence we expect that the analytical results presented in this paper will be useful in many of the physical situations mentioned above .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present our general approach . a detailed discussion of the pure case ( @xmath21 ) with nonzero drift is presented in subsection ii - a which will help us anticipate the general features of persistence in the disordered case studied later in subsection ii - b where we illustrate the mapping to a quantum mechanics problem . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the results for the disorder averaged persistence for positive drift ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the results for the negative drift ( @xmath23 ) , fundamentally different from the positive drift case , are detailed in section iv .",
    "we conclude in section v with a summary and outlook .",

    "it is also useful to define the distribution of the first - passage time @xmath25 which is simply the probability that the particle hits the origin for the first time at @xmath26 starting initially at @xmath19 .",
    "the distribution @xmath25 is related to the persistence @xmath15 via the simple relation , @xmath27 .",
