    "the coefficients of the effective hamiltonian can be determined by considering two types of excitation . in the space dimension",

    "the @xmath137 , and from eq .  (",
    "[ eq : shbbmf ] ) we get that the energy cost per site of such an excitation is equal to @xmath138 note that @xmath139 is positive , as @xmath140 for @xmath9 values of interest .",
    "the energy per site of this excitation in the rotor model [ eq .  ( 3 ) in the letter ] is @xmath141 , as @xmath142 . equating the two energies , we find that they agree if we choose @xmath143 for the spring constant .",
    "the other term is like kinetic energy , so consider a rotating state @xmath144 that is rotating at a frequency , @xmath145 .",
    "the energy changes because the rotation changes the state ( similar to how in a rotating system , there are changes of the density from the centrifugal force ) .",
    "the change can be found by using a rotating coordinate system ; i.e. define @xmath146 . then @xmath147 .",
    "if the state is just rotating , then it is a stationary state , so it is an eigenstate of @xmath148 the @xmath145 is like a magnetic field along the @xmath149 axis . what is the energy ?",
    "the pure quadrupolar state has vanishing matrix elements with the spin operators , thus it does not couple to magnetic field .",
    "however , once we apply the field , the @xmath150 deforms and the spins develop magnetic moments .",
    "the directors select a plane that is perpendicular to the field  in this case , it is the @xmath135 plane .",

    "the energy cost per site ( we do not count the @xmath159 term ) is then given as @xmath160 since by definition @xmath161 , the corresponding term in the rotor hamiltonian is @xmath162 , and for the moment of inertia we get @xmath163        [ [ schmidt - decomposition - and - density - matrix - of - the - su2-singlet - in - the - su3-symmetric - state ] ] schmidt decomposition and density matrix of the su(2 ) singlet in the su(3 ) symmetric state ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    at the ferro - su(3 ) point , the ground state of the bilinear - biquadratic @xmath7 chain is the fully symmetrical su(3 ) irreducible representation .",
    "for @xmath10 sites , it is the young - tableaux with @xmath10 boxes arranged in a row , denoted by @xmath110 , and its dimension is @xmath165 .",
    "since the su(2 ) is a subgroub of the su(3 ) , the states within a given su(3 ) irreducible representation can further be classified according the the irreducible representation of the su(2 ) subgroup .",
    "the fully symmetrical representation @xmath110 consists of @xmath166 spin states for @xmath10 even and @xmath167 for @xmath10 odd .",
    "this has important consequences for the ground state of the bilinear biquadratic model as we go away from the su(3 ) symmetric point ( but keeping the su(2 ) symmetry ) : as we enter the ferromagnetic phase , the @xmath168 high spin multiplet becomes the ground state , while for @xmath169 the @xmath170 spin singlet is the ground state .",
    "our aim is to find the schmidt decomposition of the latter state using the tools of group theory .",
    "for example , on two sites there are two irreducible representations : the antisymmetrical @xmath171 young tableaux ( two boxes arranged vertically ) of dimension 3 , which is at the same time an su(2 ) triplet , and the symmetrical @xmath172 young tableaux ( two boxes arranged horizontally ) of dimension 6 , which contains the @xmath173 su(2 ) singlet ( using the @xmath174 basis ) , and the su(2 ) quintuplet , which contains the @xmath175 @xmath176 highest weight state .",

    "this is one of the two casimir operators of the su(3 ) group ( the other one is cubic in the generators ) .",
    "the irreducible representation @xmath187 is an eigenstate of the casimir operator , @xmath188 the irreducible representations of the su(2 ) group are characterized by the total spin value @xmath189 as @xmath190 .",
    "the representations of su(3 ) are made up of several different irreducible representations of su(2 ) .",
    "the states in a representation can be generated by applying the @xmath189 s and @xmath191 s to a single state . while the @xmath174 , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 operators lead only to states within the same su(2 ) irreducible representation , the @xmath192 operators may generate states with different @xmath189 s ( but still in the same su(3 ) irreducible representation ) , where the initial and final total spin can differ by @xmath5 or @xmath193 .",
    "here we calculate the matrix elements of the quadrupole operators between the states of the @xmath194 fully symmetrical su(3 ) irreducible representation .",
    "these states can be labeled as @xmath195 ( where @xmath74 is the eigenvalue of the @xmath174 operator ) .",
    "for convenience , we consider the @xmath196 even case , where @xmath197 .",
    "we will omit the @xmath194 labels from the states when it is not confusing , so below we often write @xmath198 instead of @xmath195 .",

    ". we will concentrate below in the case when the total number of sites @xmath220 is a multiple of 4 , since in this case the su(2 ) singlet is also present in the symmetrical @xmath194 su(3 ) irreducible representations of the subsystems .",
