    "the phenomenon of zitterbewegung  ( zb ) for free relativistic electrons in a vacuum goes back to the work of schrodinger , who showed in 1930 that , due to a non - commutativity of the velocity operators with the dirac hamiltonian , relativistic electrons experience a trembling motion in absence of external fields  @xcite .",
    "the zb is a strictly quantum phenomenon as it goes beyond newton s first law of classical motion . since the schrodinger prediction the subject of zb",
    "was treated by very many theoretical papers .",
    "it was recognized that zb is due to an interference of electron states with positive and negative electron energies  @xcite .",
    "the frequency of zb oscillations predicted by schrodinger is very high , corresponding to  @xmath0 , and its amplitude is very small , being around the compton wavelength  @xmath1 10@xmath2   .",
    "thus , it is impossible to observe this effect in its original form with the currently available experimental means .",
    "in fact , even the principal observability of zb in a vacuum was often questioned in the literature @xcite . however , in a very recent paper gerritsma _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite simulated the 1 + 1 dirac equation ( de ) and the resulting zitterbewegung with the use of trapped ca ions excited by appropriate laser beams .",
    "the remarkable advantage of this method is that one can simulate the basic parameters of de , i.e.  @xmath3 and  @xmath4 , and give them desired values .",
    "this results in a much lower zb frequency and a much larger zb amplitude .",
    "the simulated values were in fact experimentally observed .",
    "the general purpose of our work is concerned with the electron zb in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the presence of a constant magnetic field does not cause electron transitions between negative and positive electron energies . on the other hand , it quantizes the energy spectrum into landau levels which brings qualitatively new features into the zb .",
    "our work has three objectives .",
    "first , we calculate the zitterbewegung of relativistic electrons in a vacuum in the presence of an external magnetic field at the operator level .",
    "we obtain exact analytical formulas for this problem .",
    "second , we calculate average values describing zb of an electron prepared in the form of a gaussian wave packet . these average values can be directly related to possible observations . however , as mentioned above and confirmed by our calculations , the corresponding frequencies and amplitudes of zb in a vacuum are not accessible experimentally at present . for this reason , and this is our third objective , we propose and describe simulations of zb in the presence of a magnetic field with the use of trapped ions .",
    "we do this keeping in mind the recent experiments reported by gerritsma  _ et al._. we show that , employing the simulation parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , one should be able to observe the magnetic effects in zb .",
    "the problem of zb in a magnetic field was treated before  @xcite , but the results were limited to the operator level and suffered from various deficiencies which we mention in appendix  [ appendixbarut ] . a similar problem was treated in ref .",
    "@xcite at the operator level in weak magnetic field limit .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite treated a related problem of mesoscopic superposition states in relativistic landau levels .",
    "we come back to this work in the discussion .",
    "our treatment aims to calculate directly the observable zitterbewegung effects .",
    "preliminary results of our work were published in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an important aspect of zb , which was not considered in the pioneering work of schrodinger and most of the papers that followed it , is an existence of the fermi sea of electrons filling negative energy states .",
    "this feature can seriously affect the phenomenon of zb , see  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that both our calculations as well as the simulations using trapped ions  @xcite are based on the empty dirac equation for which zb certainly exists .",
    "we come back to this problem in the discussion .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii we use the 3 + 1 dirac equation to derive the time dependence of operators describing motion of relativistic electrons in a vacuum in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "intraband frequency components ( the cyclotron motion ) are distinguished from interband frequency components ( the trembling motion ) . in sections iii and",
    "iv we treat the same subject calculating averages of the time - dependent heisenberg operators with the use of gaussian wave packets .",
    "this formulation is more closely related to possible experiments . in section",
    "v we simulate the 2 + 1 dirac equation and the resulting electron zitterbewegung employing trapped ions and laser excitations in connection with the recent experimental simulation of electron zb in absence of magnetic field . in section",
    "vi we discuss our results .",
    "the paper is concluded by a summary . in appendices we discuss some technical aspects of the calculations and the relation of our work to that of other authors .",

    "the phenomenon of electron zb in a vacuum is commonly interpreted as resulting from an interference of electron states corresponding to positive and negative electron energies .",
    "the characteristic interband frequency of zb is a direct consequence of this feature .",
    "the initial electron wave packet must contain these positive and negative energy components .",
    "it may be difficult to prepare such a packet if all negative energies are occupied .",
    "what is more , the fully occupied negative energies may prevent the interference ( and hence zb ) to occur , see  @xcite .",
    "it has been a matter of controversy what happens when an electron - positron hole pair is created by a gamma quantum  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a system with negative electron energies can be relatively easily created in semiconductors , see  @xcite . it should be mentioned that an external magnetic field does not create by itself the electron - positron pairs .",
    "we emphasize again that our present calculations and the experimental simulation of ref .",
    "@xcite are realized for the one - electron dirac equation for which zb certainly exists .",
    "bermudez _ et al . _",
    "@xcite treated the problem of time dependent relativistic landau states by mapping the relativistic model of electrons in a magnetic field onto a combination of the jaynes - cummings and anti - jaynes - cummings interactions known from quantum optics . for simplicity the @xmath460 restriction was assumed .",
    "three regimes of high ( macroscopic ) , small ( microscopic ) and intermediate ( mesoscopic ) landau quantum numbers n were considered . in all the cases one interband frequency contributed to the zitterbewegung because the authors did not use a gaussian wave packet to calculate average values .",
    "our exact calculation of zitterbewegung of relativistic electrons in a vacuum in the presence of a magnetic field and its simulation by trapped ions are in close relation with the proof - of - principle experiment of gerritsma _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who simulated the 1 + 1 dirac equation and the resulting electron zb in absence of magnetic field .",
    "our results show that , paradoxically , the simulation of the de with a magnetic field is simpler than that without the field .",
    "however , there is a price to pay : one needs at least the 2 + 1 de to describe the magnetic motion since @xmath461 parallel  @xmath110 couples the electron motion in  @xmath109 and  @xmath403 directions .",
    "in summary , we treated the problem of electron zitterbewegung in the presence of a magnetic field in three ways . first , we carried calculations at the operator level deriving from the one - electron dirac equation the exact and analytical time - dependent equations of motion for appropriate operators and finally for the electron trajectory .",
    "it turned out that , in the presence of a magnetic field , the electron motion contains both intraband and interband frequency components , which we identified as the cyclotron motion and the trembling motion  ( zb ) , respectively .",
    "next , we described the same problem using averages of the heisenberg time - dependent operators over gaussian wave packets in order to obtain physical quantities directly comparable to possible experimental verifications .",
    "we found that , in addition to the usual problems with the very high frequency and very small amplitude of electron zitterbewegung in a vacuum , the effects of a magnetic field achievable in terrestrial conditions on zb are very small . in view of this , we simulated the dirac equation with the use of trapped atomic ions and laser excitations in order to achieve more favorable ratios of @xmath462 than those achievable in a vacuum , in the spirit of recently realized experimental simulations of the 1 + 1 dirac equation and the resulting electron zitterbewegung .",
    "various characteristics of the relativistic electron motion were investigated and we found that the influence of a simulated magnetic field on zb is considerable and certainly observable .",
    "it was shown that the 3 + 1 dirac equation describes decaying zb oscillations while the 2 + 1 dirac equation describes stationary zb oscillations .",
    "we hope that our theoretical predictions will prompt experimental simulations of electron zitterbewegung in the presence of a magnetic field .      in this appendix",
