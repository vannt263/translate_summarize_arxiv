    "liller  1 has a small optical core radius ( about 65 ) .",
    "radio observations of transient x - ray binaries have found several to be radio transients as well ( see for a review ) , both black hole candidates ( a0620@xmath000 , gs  2000 + 25 , gs  2023 + 33 , gs  1124@xmath068 ) and neutron stars ( aql  x-1 , cir  x-1 , cen  x-4 ) . the outbursts of x - ray transients are due to a sudden turn - on of accretion onto the compact object in a binary lasting from @xmath3days to months @xcite . the radio spectral and temporal behavior in some of these objects is described by a synchrotron bubble model @xcite which indicates that there are plasma outflows associated with the x - ray outburst . in particular , the black hole candidate and superluminal jet source grs  1915 + 105 has been seen to exhibit correlated behavior at x - ray , infrared and radio wavelengths @xcite that is readily understood in terms of the synchrotron emission of expanding plasmoids that have been ejected from the inner regions of the system @xcite .    despite its frequent x - ray outbursts ( average interval , @xmath4 days ; ) ,",
    "several previous studies have not detected radio emission from the rb @xcite .",
    "improvements in radio sensitivity since some of those studies were performed made the detection of a rb radio counterpart at previously unattainable flux levels practical .",
    "furthermore , the advent of the  all - sky monitor made it possible to correlate radio observations with a well sampled x - ray light curve .",
    "we therefore undertook a search for a radio counterpart of the rapid burster in x - ray outburst .",
    "since the type  ii x - ray bursts of the rapid burster are thought to be caused by the same phenomenon ( spasmodic accretion ) as the x - ray outbursts @xcite , one might expect that they are accompanied by simultaneous radio emission .",
    "the observations reported here marginally exclude ( at the 2.9@xmath2 level ) simultaneous radio burst emission from the likely radio counterpart .",
    "the rb is a transient x - ray source which has been observed during the past few years to go into outburst approximately every 220 days for a period of @xmath330 days @xcite .",
    "it is the only low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) which produces two different types of x - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "type  i bursts , which are observed from @xmath340 other lmxbs , are due to thermonuclear flashes on the surface of an accreting neutron star .",
    "type  ii bursts , which have been observed from only one other lmxb ( gro  j1744@xmath028 ; ) , are sudden releases of gravitational potential energy resulting from accretion instabilities . for a detailed review of type  i and",
    "type  ii bursts , see lewin , van  paradijs and taam @xcite .",
    "the rb does not fit easily into the `` z / atoll '' paradigm of lmxbs @xcite , in which the correlated x - ray fast - timing and spectral behavior of lmxbs divides the population into two classes @xcite . however , the rb is known to exhibit periods of behavior characteristic of an atoll source . during an outburst in 1983 , the rb exhibited strong persistent emission ( pe ) and type  i bursts with no type  ii bursts  behavior typical of the atoll sources @xcite .",
    "this behavior has also been seen in outbursts observed more recently with .",
    "for the first @xmath317 days of these outbursts , strong pe is accompanied only by type  i x - ray bursts .",
    "type  ii bursting behavior begins after this period and continues while the pe decreases ( details of these observations are given in ) .    in spite of 20 years of theoretical modeling ,",
    "no satisfactory model exists for the disk instability which drives the type  ii bursts ( for a review , see ) .",
    "models which require weak magnetic fields ( @xmath5 g ) were effectively excluded with the discovery of gro  j1744@xmath028 , which contains a pulsar with a magnetic field of @xmath6 g @xcite , and also exhibits type  ii bursts @xcite",
    ".      there have been several radio studies of fields of view containing liller  1 , some with the goal of identifying a radio counterpart of the rapid burster .",
    "some have focussed on finding radio variability in hopes of catching bursts in the radio correlated with type  ii x - ray bursts while others have sought persistent radio sources .",

    "one can decrease the noise level in the radio data by simply increasing the integration time .",

    "[ sec : upplim ]            for the asm , the best - fit linear relation between the 8.4  ghz flux density measured at the vla and the asm x - ray flux ( forcing the line through the origin ) gives @xmath25 .",
    "however , this is a very poor fit , with a reduced @xmath26 ( for 6 degrees of freedom ) . for the pca data ,",
    "the relation is @xmath27 , again with a very poor fit ( @xmath28 for 4 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "these data and the linear fits are shown in figure  [ fig : asmpca ] .",
    "it seems also plausible ( observationally , if not theoretically ) that the radio source is `` on '' at a constant flux density ( of 32525  at 8.4  ghz ) whenever the x - ray source is above a threshold of @xmath33 asm c / s ( @xmath3500 pca c / s ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : asmpca ] panel ( a ) , we also show the 3@xmath2 upper limits for the excess radio emission correlated with the average type  ii burst intensity . the two most constraining upper limits ( which were drawn from the same data ; see section  [ sec : upplim ] ) are still marginally consistent with the radio detections during periods of x - ray persistent emission of comparable x - ray intensity .",
    "the most constraining simultaneous radio emission limit during the type  ii bursts is discrepant at the 2.9@xmath2 level .",
    "one possible description of our radio flux density measurements involves a synchrotron bubble model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the physical source of the radiation is a dense , expanding bubble of plasma .",
    "the relativistic electrons in the plasma ( assumed to have a more or less isotropic velocity distribution and a power - law energy distribution ) emit synchrotron radiation as their trajectories are deflected by interactions with ambient or entangled magnetic fields .",
    "the resulting radio spectrum is strongly peaked with a power law form at frequencies ( much ) below or above the peak frequency .",
    "this peak frequency decreases as the bubble expands in a well - determined fashion : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the peak frequency , @xmath31 is the normalized radius of the bubble , and @xmath32 is the power - law index of the electron energy distribution , @xmath33 @xcite .    a synchrotron bubble s time dependent radio emission is completely determined if we set the time , @xmath34 , and the flux density at spectral peak , @xmath35 , when the spectral peak reaches some nominal frequency @xmath36 ( which we will take to be the vla x - band , 8.44  ghz ) .",
    "furthermore , one must define the functional form of the bubble s radial expansion in time . here",
    "we adopt the convention of previous authors @xcite and assume a power - law form for this expansion : @xmath37 .",
    "the initial hypothesis that we wish to investigate is whether our radio flux measurements may be explained by the evolution of a single synchrotron bubble initiated at the start of each x - ray outburst .",
    "we perform this analysis for two primary reasons : first , models of this nature , with time scales of the order of those observed in the radio emission , have proven successful in modeling the radio outbursts of other x - ray binaries @xcite ; second , even if the model is not successful , we expect it to give insight into the physical processes responsible for the radio emission we observe .",
    "we determine the x - ray outburst start times by fitting the  asm light - curve to a functional form consisting of an onset time , a linear rise in intensity , a peak intensity time , and an exponential decay  similar to the form used by guerriero et  al.@xmath7  @xcite , except that we do not include the secondary flares which are found by those authors in two of the outbursts .",
    "the results of our fits are consistent with those of guerriero et  al.@xmath7 , and parameter uncertainties are probably dominated by the systematics associated with this simplified outburst intensity model .",
    "based on these fits , we determine the time after outburst onset for each of the radio observations .",
    "we have performed fits to our radio observations using the synchrotron bubble model of eqs .",
    "11 & 12 ; note however that his eq .  11 is incorrectly typeset and should read @xmath38 }                 { [ 1 - \\exp(-\\tau_m ) ] } \\ ] ] where the variables are as defined in that work . for purposes of this analysis",
    ", we assume that the observed rb outbursts generate synchrotron bubbles with identical physical properties and time evolution .",
    "the data are not sufficient to adequately constrain all four independent parameters so we have fixed the expansion index @xmath39 at three canonical values : @xmath40 corresponding to free expansion with constant velocity , @xmath41 corresponding to energy - conserving expansion into an ambient medium ( as in the sedov phase of a supernova remnant ) , and @xmath42 resulting from a momentum - conserving ( but not adiabatic ) expansion into an ambient medium @xcite .",
    "application of the geometric corrections to the van der laan model suggested by hjellming and johnston @xcite altered the fit parameters slightly but did not significantly improve the fits or change the character of the solutions ( the light curves changed by less than 10% ) .",
    "therefore , we quote results from the simpler model .",
    "the resulting synchrotron bubble parameters are given in table  [ tab : synch ]              as indicated in table  [ tab : synch ] , the models provide reasonable , but statistically unacceptable , fits to the data ( @xmath54 1.74.4 , for nine degrees of freedom ) .",
    "given our many simplifying assumptions , particularly the assumption that all outbursts are identical , this is perhaps not surprising .",
    "we note that the free expansion ( @xmath40 ) model fit is significantly worse than the other two and violates the @xmath11 upper limit imposed by the 1998  january  30 scuba observation ( figure  [ fig : synall]a ) ; for these reasons we prefer the models which assume a deceleration of the bubble s expansion by an ambient medium .",
    "even these models , however , are in the end physically unacceptable , as may be determined by looking at the underlying physical parameters .",
    "we can express @xmath55 in terms of the ambient magnetic field density , @xmath56 , and the angular extent of the source , @xmath57 , at time , as follows : @xmath58 where @xmath32 is the power - law index of the electron energy distribution ( 2.6@xmath48 for the adiabatic model and 9.0@xmath51 for the momentum - conserving model ) , and @xmath59 is a known function that varies from 4.1 to 1.04 as @xmath32 increases from 1 to 10 : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the euler gamma function .    under the adiabatic assumption , the 8.44  ghz flux density of the source when the spectral peak reaches that frequency is @xmath62  , whereas under the momentum - conserving assumption it is 44050  .",
    "thus the indications are that @xmath63 at , under both models , for fields of the order of a milligauss ( with a weak  dependence on the actual field strength ) . at the distance of the rb ( 8.6  kpc ) that corresponds to a linear size of @xmath64 light - seconds , and expansion velocities at time  of order 1  , much too slow for the expanding hot plasma that the model requires .",
    "we are forced to conclude that more complicated models are required to accurately describe the observations ( see section  [ sub : bubble ] ) .",
    "first , we consider the probability that an unrelated radio source lies close to the rb on the sky .",
    "micro - jansky source counts at 8.44  ghz by windhorst et al .",
    "@xcite find a source density of @xmath65 for flux densities above 300  .",
    "therefore , the probability of an unrelated source brighter than 300  falling within 86 of the x - ray position of the rb is @xmath66 .",
    "it should be noted that the  sources are typically associated with faint blue galaxies @xcite and that the survey fields are not representative of the rich environment of a globular cluster near the galactic center .",
    "because the  source population in an environments comparable to liller  1 is unknown , we do not use the probability computed above in our evaluation of the counterpart likelihood which is based exclusively on the correlation between the radio and x - ray lightcurves .",
    "the best x - ray position for the rb @xcite places the radio source 86 away from the rb with @xmath23 x - ray and radio uncertainties of 16 and 01 , respectively . taken at face value ,",
    "this is significant at the 5.4@xmath2 level , not including the systematic uncertainty in the radio to optical ( i.e.  star tracker ) reference frame shift .",
    "this makes the radio source identification with the rb seem less likely .",
    "however , further investigation reveals that the quoted gaussian errors are an inadequate description of the true error distribution .",
    "the einstein position for the rapid burster was determined from a single pointing ( four einstein hri pointings at liller  1 were made , but only one found the rb in outburst ) . the 16  @xmath23 uncertainty in this position",
    "is estimated from the dispersion of the errors in the single - pointing einstein positions of x - ray sources with known optical counterparts @xcite .",
    "an important cross - check of the requisite star - tracker calibration ( which dealt with a number of complex systematic effects ; ) was provided by the einstein globular cluster x - ray source program , which performed multiple pointings at each of eight globular clusters ( glcls ) with known bright x - ray sources in order to determine the positions of these sources to better than 16 accuracy @xcite .",
    "these eight clusters were ngc 104 ( 47 tuc ) , ngc  1851 , terzan  2 , liller  1 , ngc  6441 , ngc  6624 , ngc  6712 , and ngc  7078 ( m15 ) .",
    "if the star - tracker calibration was successful in accounting for all significant sources of systematic error , then we would expect the resulting sample standard deviations , @xmath67 in the positions of the glcl x - ray sources as derived from the multiple pointings at each , to cluster strongly around @xmath68 .",
    "examining the quoted uncertainties of grindlay et al .",
    "@xcite , however , we find that the actual @xmath69 values deviate from 16 by up to a factor of two  @xmath70 for the x - ray source in ngc  6712 ( 5 pointings ) , while @xmath71 for the x - ray source in terzan  2 ( 4 pointings ) .",
    "a @xmath72 test shows that in ngc  6712 , @xmath69 is too small at the 98% confidence level and that for terzan  2 , @xmath69 is too large with 99.95% confidence .",
    "together , these deviations are unlikely to be statistical and they represent two out of the seven clusters examined ( recall that liller  1 had only one pointing with a detection , so its @xmath69 value is undetermined ) .    we conclude that there are probably remaining unaccounted - for systematic effects in the einstein aspect solutions .",
    "these effects average into the quoted 16 error over many pointings , but caused substantial non - gaussian excursions within the context of the glcl x - ray source program .",
    "since the multiple pointings at each cluster were typically executed over a time span of weeks to months , the unaccounted - for systematics are not likely to be temporal in nature , but rather to relate to position on the sky .",
    "they may relate , for example , to the density of suitable stars within the star - tracker fields . in this connection it is worth noting that terzan  2 and liller  1 are the two sample glcls nearest the galactic center , and are only 3  apart on the sky .",
    "the probability that the observed radio / x - ray behavior is produced by an unrelated background radio source depends on the model for the variability behavior of that source .",
    "we consider first a source model in which the background radio source varies randomly with a duty cycle , @xmath73 , and has a short auto - correlation time - scale allowing us to consider each of our measurements to be statistically independent .",
    "we take the radio source to be `` on '' or `` off '' when our 1@xmath2 radio sensitivity is @xmath970  and the source is or is not detected , respectively , at the @xmath11 level .",
    "moreover , we define the rapid burster to be `` on '' or `` off '' ( for these purposes ) when its one - day average  asm count rate is greater or less than 4 cts / sec ( see figure  [ fig : asmpca ] and section  [ sub : xray - v - radio ] ) . based on these assumptions , the probability of an unrelated variable background radio source mimicking the x - ray on / off state of the rb is the product of the normalized probability distribution for obtaining the number of radio `` on '' and `` off '' observations for a given @xmath73 , and the probability distribution of observing the radio and x - ray sources to be `` on '' and `` off '' simultaneously for a given @xmath73 , integrated over all values of @xmath73 :      where @xmath75 is the total number of times the radio source is observed `` on '' , @xmath76 is the total number of times the radio source is observed `` off '' , @xmath77 is the number of times the radio source and x - ray source are observed on simultaneously , and @xmath78 is the number of times the radio source and x - ray source are observed off simultaneously . we have assumed a uniform prior distribution for @xmath73 itself . for our observations ( _ cf . _  table  [ tab : radio ] ) , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , which yields a probability of 1.2% for an unrelated radio source mimicking the observed on - off behavior of the rb .",
    "this indicates that it is unlikely that the observed radio / x - ray correlation is produced by a randomly varying background radio source .",
    "more complex models for the radio source might postulate that it occasionally turns `` on '' and remains so for @xmath83 days ( auto - correlation time scale ) . we can estimate the probability of a chance correlation of such a source with the rapid burster , without performing involved monte carlo simulations , by making use of the framework developed above . if we speculate that @xmath83 is such that the two detections during nov  1996 ( separated by 5  days ) are perfectly correlated and all other observations are uncorrelated , then we have 5 coincident x - ray / radio observations ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) , and the probability of a chance correlation is 2.6% .",
    "note that if the auto - correlation time scale is shorter than 5 days then all six observations are statistically independent as above .",
    "note also that the auto - correlation time scale can not be much longer than 5 days , because as it approaches @xmath320 days it approaches the observed radio on / off time ( that is , the initial non - detection followed by a detection during nov  1996 , and the detection followed by a non - detection in june / july  1997 ) .    one might reasonably be concerned about the possibility of an unrelated radio source that turns `` on '' suddenly and remains so for an extended period of time .",
    "the radio data do not exclude the possibility that such a source was present and remained `` on '' during the unsampled period between the nov  1996 and june / july  1997 outbursts of the rb . in this case",
    ", we have only three independent measurements of coincidence with the rb .",
    "however , the radio source is observed to make the transition from `` off '' to `` on '' ( and the reverse ) in 25  d. the radio data show one `` turn - on '' and one `` turn - off '' both of which are well sampled and coincident with the x - ray behavior of the rb .",
    "if an unrelated radio source turns `` on '' every @xmath3300  d , then the probability of the `` turn - on '' coincidence observed in nov  1996 is @xmath38% .",
    "the slow decay of the rb x - ray outburst makes a `` turn - off '' coincidence somewhat more probable .",
    "if we can not distinguish `` turn - offs '' that are separated by @xmath86  d , then the probability of the observed coincidence in the june / july  1997 outburst is @xmath315% .",
    "if the two events are independent , the probability of this type of source mimicking the observed rb x - ray turn - on / off behavior is @xmath31% .",
    "the population of  radio transients and their outburst properties are not well studied .",
    "the probability of an unrelated , variable radio source having the time - dependent characteristics above and lying this close to the rb is somewhat less than unity although we have neglected this in the above calculations .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume the most conservative of the above approaches as the upper limit ; we therefore find that the upper limit on the probability of a flaring background radio source mimicking the x - ray behavior of the rb is 3% .",
    "[ [ possible - relationship - between - the - radio - object - and - the - present - object ] ] possible relationship between the  radio object and the present object ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    the relationship between the variable radio source we observe and the steep spectrum source ( @xmath87 ) observed by  is not clear . to within the astrometric uncertainty ( 15 , 3@xmath2 ) ,",
    "the two sources are at the same position on the sky .",
    "if s interpretation of their source is correct and it represents the integrated emission of a population of radio pulsars , then it seems likely that their radio position is the center of the gc .",
    "( the @xmath32separation between the  radio source and the optical center of liller  1 is consistent with the 1  uncertainty in the absolute optical astrometry ; see figure  [ fig : rbradio ] ) . for a 65 core - radius gc @xcite ,",
    "the 15 radio error circle represents 12% of the optical light of the gc .",
    "thus , it is not unlikely that ( if the rb is associated with the gc ) the radio counterpart to the rapid burster would also lie close to the center of the gc .",
    "the three flux - density measurements of the  source were made over three different ( sometimes overlapping ) epochs . combining the three measurements into a single spectrum ( which was found to be steep )",
    "assumes that the source is not variable .",
    "the conflicting 1.5  ghz measurements of  and johnston et  al.@xmath7  may indicate variability of a factor of two or more ( 2@xmath2 ) between april 1990 and may 1993 .",
    "the x - ray state of the rapid burster during these observations is unknown , and it may be that it was x - ray active during s 1.5  ghz observation , providing the additional radio flux above that expected for an underlying population of radio pulsars in liller  1 .",
    "the relationship between the  radio source and the rb could be illuminated by radio measurements of the same epoch at 0.33 , 1.5 and 4.5  ghz , taken both while the rb is in x - ray outburst and in quiescence .",
    "the probability that a serendipitously located variable radio source would mimic the rapid burster x - ray state as has been observed is small ( 13% ) , but not dismissably so .",
    "the number and distribution of faint , variable radio sources toward the galactic center is not well known",
    ". there has been at least one other recent instance where a radio source , variable on a time - scale of @xmath3days , was discovered @xmath88 from a bright x - ray source ( although the x - ray flux was not correlated ; ) .",
    "in addition , globular clusters are known to harbor both millisecond radio pulsars and accreting x - ray sources , so the appearance of an unrelated variable radio source in liller  1 must be considered more likely than for a random field .",
    "other than the correlated radio and x - ray states and the marginal consistency of the radio spectrum with synchrotron - bubble models , we have not observed any radio behavior which would tie this object uniquely to the rapid burster .    the apparent positional discrepancy between the radio source and rb is likely explained by the non - gaussian distribution of the x - ray position error as discussed above and acknowledged by grindlay et al.@xcite and grindlay @xcite .",
    "proper motion of the rb will probably contribute only negligibly to the discrepancy , given the association with liller  1 , even though an interval of 20 years separates the  and radio observations ( a proper motion of @xmath305 per year is required ) .",
    "improvement upon the x - ray localization will be obtained during an approved observation , which should determine the x - ray position to 05 , thus confirming or excluding this radio counterpart .    at present",
    ", we identify this radio source as a likely radio counterpart of the rapid burster . apart from the  observation , the case",
    "could be strengthened by observing bursts from this location ( either in radio or ir ) , by continued observations in x - ray and radio of correlated on / off behavior , by observation of larger swings in the x - ray and radio fluxes which would permit a definite x - ray / radio correlation to emerge , or by discovering other radio behavior which is correlated with x - ray behavior of the rapid burster ( such as short time - scale variability ) .",
    "for example , a program of 12 short vla observations reaching a noise level of 45 /beam taken at two - week intervals and correlated with contemporaneous  asm observations would reduce the probability of an unrelated source mimicking the rb to 0.03% , even if the rb remains quiescent in x - rays and there are no radio detections .        the jcmt / scuba observation at 350  ghz is , to date , the earliest radio observation relative to the beginning of an x - ray outburst .",
    "a few hours prior to this observation , a pca observation measured the rb pe to be 4000100 c / s . using the measured radio spectral slope ( @xmath39=0.90.3 ) and the pca / radio conversion at 8.4  ghz",
    ", the extrapolated radio spectrum gives a 350  ghz flux density of 4.541  mjy ( with uncertainty dominated by the spectral slope ) .",
    "this is well above the 3 mjy @xmath11 upper limit obtained at the jcmt indicating that the radio emission is not a simple power - law spectrum , proportional in intensity to the instantaneous x - ray intensity .",
    "this non - detection is also the crucial observation in ruling out one class of synchrotron bubble models ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "synchrotron bubble behavior , associated with the outburst of an x - ray transient , has been observed on many occasions ; hjellming & han @xcite show radio data and fits for a0620@xmath000 , cen  x-4 , gs  2000 + 25 , aql  x-1 , gs  2023 + 338 ( v404  cyg ) , and grs  1124@xmath0683 ( see also ) . in that respect",
    "the detection of radio emission from the rapid burster during its outbursts is not particularly surprising .",
    "the physical parameters derived from our model fits , however , indicate expansion velocities of @xmath31  about 10  d after the outburst start which is well below the physical lower limit set by the sound speed of the hot plasma , @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 is the temperature of the plasma in kelvin , @xmath310@xmath92 in ss  433  ) .",
    "our assumption of a generic bubble event accompanying each outburst is therefore likely to be flawed and we must consider more complex models .",
    "for example , radio emission over the course of an outburst may result from the summed emission of a succession of synchrotron bubbles , each of which expands at high speed and therefore brightens and fades ( at a given frequency ) much more quickly than the emission at large .",
    "if the flux levels that we see are produced by @xmath93 plasma , then the expected rise times for the synchrotron bubbles are @xmath31 hour .",
    "alternatively , each of our radio detections may simply have caught a single fast bubble in the midst of its expansion ; in that case , the timing of our detections would indicate how the rate of these bubble ejections changes over the course of an outburst .",
    "relevant to both of these possibilities , it is worth noting that the radio flares from grs  1915 + 105 have rise and decay times of @xmath31 hour @xcite .",
    "we are therefore motivated to consider whether the type  ii x - ray bursts of the rapid burster might produce individual synchrotron bubbles , with associated infrared and radio emission .",
    "the synchrotron bubbles of grs  1915 + 105 have been shown to be related to active accretion , as determined by simultaneous x - ray observations @xcite . scaling down",
    "the brightness of the infrared emission seen in that source by the factor of ten difference in x - ray flux between it and the rb suggests that there may be mjy infrared flares ( @xmath94 ) during rb type  ii x - ray bursts , if synchrotron bubbles are indeed being formed .",
    "we are currently pursuing short time - resolution ir observations of the rb during its next outburst to test this hypothesis ; naturally , observation of any bursting counterpart to the rb will confirm or reject the vla counterpart proposed here .",
    "the radio detections we report here could not themselves have been produced by the type  ii x - ray bursts ; the radio detections were made prior to day 12 of each outburst , while the type  ii x - ray bursts were not observed until after day 14 in every case .",
    "the observations of 1997  july  24 were carried out when the vla was in its new cs ( c - short ) configuration .",
    "the combination of the array configuration with low - elevation observing yielded many short projected baselines with lengths all the way down to the antenna separation ( 25  m ) .",
    "heavily tapered maps of these data reveal an extended source with peak flux density of approximately 3  mjy ( at 8.44  ghz ) that is at least as large as the primary beam .",
    "the axis of symmetry of the extended source lies at its closest point approximately @xmath95 north - east from the rb , which corresponds to 2.5  pc at the 8.6  kpc distance of the rb .",
    "the source is probably unrelated to the rb but its presence is an important consideration for future observations that include short interferometric baselines .",
    "we have detected a likely radio counterpart for the rapid burster , with radio emission correlated with the x - ray outbursts .",
    "the likelihood of unrelated variable radio source duplicating the observed correlation between the x - ray flux and radio flux density is low ( 13% ) , but not dismissably so .",
    "there is an apparent discrepancy between the x - ray position of the rb and the radio counterpart but it is likely due to the non - gaussian distribution of the x - ray position errors .",
    "confirmation of the counterpart from additional observations  an already approved  observation , further radio observations while the  asm is still operational , or possibly infrared observations while the rb is in outburst  is required . the time and spectral evolution of the radio source ,",
    "while not physically interpretable as a full - outburst synchrotron - bubble ( as seen in some other transient x - ray binaries ) , may be due to @xmath3hour - long radio flares such as have been seen from the superluminal - jet source grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "our lower - limit on the time delay between x - ray emission and radio emission from the type  ii bursts ( 1 sec ) is consistent with the delay expected from a synchrotron bubble .",
    "our observation of a persistent radio source @xmath35 days after the start of active accretion ( i.e.  an outburst ) sets an upper limit for the radio vs.x - ray time delay .",
    "the correlation of radio flux density with persistent x - ray intensity in this system indicates that the radio flux density is related to active accretion onto the surface of the neutron star  as accretion is responsible for the x - ray outburst .",
    "this suggests that excess radio emission may be produced during the type  ii x - ray bursts , which are themselves accretion driven .",
    "however , our observations produce no evidence of simultaneous radio / x - ray bursts , marginally constraining them ( 2.9@xmath2 ) to be below the level that we observe during periods of comparable x - ray flux in persistent emission .",
    "this may imply that radio bursts at 8.4  ghz do not occur simultaneously with x - ray type  ii bursts .",
