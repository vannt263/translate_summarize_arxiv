    "the detailed study of hydrogen atom emission spectra was essential for the understanding of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "this is partially due to the simple composition of the hydrogen atom , consisting of just two particles , and partially due to the large mass difference between the proton and the electron , which mostly decouples the proton spin from the electron spin . as a consequence ,",
    "the fine- and hyperfine structures of hydrogen atoms are characterized by significantly different energy scales .",
    "similarly , the detailed study of mesons composed of a heavy and a light valence quark supports the understanding of quantum chromodynamics and the limitations of its low - energy approximations , such as the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopy of @xmath16 mesons , which contain a @xmath17 quark and a @xmath18 or @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) quark , provides an important testing ground for hqet .",
    "the ground state @xmath16 mesons and the spin-1 @xmath21 mesons have been thoroughly studied @xcite .",
    "this paper studies the states with orbital angular momentum @xmath22 and a higher excited state . for each type of @xmath23 meson , four distinct states with @xmath22 are possible , each with different couplings between the spin of the quarks and the orbital angular momentum . assuming the bottom quark to be heavy",
    ", hqet predicts that the dynamics is dominated by the coupling between the orbital angular momentum and the spin of the light quark that combine to a total light - quark angular momentum @xmath24 or @xmath25 , which corresponds to the fine structure in the hydrogen atom .",
    "additional contributions arise due to the spin of the @xmath17 quark .",
    "this results in two doublets of states , corresponding to fine- and hyperfine - splitting , that are collectively referred to as @xmath26 mesons .",
    "the states with @xmath24 are named @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath6 ( @xmath29 ) mesons ; the states with @xmath25 are named @xmath6 ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath30 ) mesons , where @xmath31 is the total angular momentum .    in hqet ,",
    "different results originate from various approximations adopted in the calculation of the light - quark degrees of freedom .",
    "such calculations can neglect or include relativistic effects as well as the dynamical spin dependence of the potential between the quarks . while most of the recent predictions are based on hqet  @xcite ,",
    "other approaches exist , including predictions using lattice - gauge calculations @xcite , potential models @xcite , heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) @xcite , chiral theory @xcite , and qcd strings @xcite , allowing the masses , widths , and relative branching ratios to be calculated .",
    "predictions of @xmath32 properties are shown in tables  [ tab : predictedmasses ] and [ tab : predictedwidths ] .    .predicted @xmath32 masses .",
    "all values are in mev@xmath33 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +",
    "using the full cdf run ii data sample , we measure the masses and widths of @xmath26 mesons . for the first time , we observe exclusively reconstructed @xmath34 mesons and measure the width of the @xmath35 state .",
    "the results are consistent with , and significantly more precise than previous determinations based on a subset of the present data  @xcite , which are superseded .",
    "the results are also generally compatible with determinations by the d0  @xcite and lhcb experiments  @xcite .",
    "the only exception is the remaining discrepancy with the d0 measurement of the mass difference between @xmath36 and @xmath37 mesons , which increases to @xmath38 .",
    "the properties of the @xmath39 and @xmath34 states are within @xmath40 consistent with isospin symmetry .",
    "the measured @xmath41 masses are in agreement with the hqet predictions in ref .",
    "the qcd string calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite matches data with a deviation of about 10  mev/@xmath42 .",
    "the lattice calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite predicts the @xmath6 mass accurately with a deviation of only 6  mev/@xmath42 , but is off by 35  mev/@xmath42 for the @xmath43 mass . the heavy - quark symmetry and potential - model - based predictions in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite are about 30  mev/@xmath42 above and below the measured values , respectively .",
    "our measurement is consistent with the hqet predictions of the @xmath44 widths in refs .",
    "@xcite and the @xmath45 prediction in ref .",
    "the @xmath46 masses are described by hqet calculations  @xcite within 36  mev/@xmath42 .",
    "the lattice calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite agree with the measurements within theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the hqet prediction in ref .",
    "@xcite and predictions based on chiral theory  @xcite , potential models  @xcite , and lattice calculations  @xcite are about 3060  mev/@xmath42 too high .",
    "the @xmath46 width predictions by hqet  @xcite are 12  mev/@xmath42 above the measurements while the prediction of @xmath47 in ref .",
    "@xcite agrees well with the experimental result .",
    "we observe a previously - unseen charged and neutral @xmath14 signal with a significance of @xmath48 .",
    "interpreting it as a single state , referred to here as @xmath0 , we measure the properties of the new resonance for charged and neutral @xmath14 combinations and find them to be statistically consistent as expected by isospin symmetry .",
