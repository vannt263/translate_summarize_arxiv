    "the formation of stars is far from being a well understood and solved problem . the complex interplay between star formation",
    ", the formation of molecular clouds , and the physical processes operating within the interstellar medium ( ism ) , such as turbulence , magnetic fields , self - gravity , or feedback from the stellar population , poses many formidable challenges to the proper interpretation and modeling of the star formation process ( e.g. , ) .",
    "fortunately , observations have revealed a number of empirical relations which provide some guidance for the development of a theoretical model .",
    "this includes the well - studied kennicutt - schmidt relation , a correlation between the surface density of the neutral ism and @xmath0 @xcite . the realization that star formation is more closely correlated with molecular gas than neutral gas ( @xcite , but cf .",
    "@xcite ) led to considerable interest in the study of the @xmath3 relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of the @xmath3 relation are tied to the small scale ( scales of molecular clouds and below ) connection between star formation and the supply in form of molecular gas .",
    "therefore , measuring the slope and scatter relation refer , more precisely , to the slope and to the standard deviation of the residuals ( estimated from a linear regression ) of the @xmath11 relation .",
    "] of the @xmath3 relation allows to probe potentially relevant physical mechanisms that are involved in the star formation process .",
    "this requires , of course , that biases in the observational tracers used to derive @xmath1 and @xmath0 are properly accounted for .",
    "the main goal of this paper is therefore to study and isolate the importance of both various physical mechanisms and observational biases for the slope and scatter of the @xmath3 relation .",
    "our theoretical predictions are based on high resolution , cosmological galaxy formation simulations equipped with subgrid models to estimate @xmath6 abundances and sfrs .",
    "we study observational biases by post - processing our simulations with a model for the @xmath12 line emission of @xmath5 ( @xcite ; paper i from now on ) .",
    "@xmath5 line emission is the most commonly used tracer to measure @xmath6 abundances ( e.g. , ) .",
    "detecting @xmath6 in emission is difficult due to the high energy gap between the ground state and the lowest excited levels of @xmath6 and the lack of a permanent electric dipole moment of the @xmath6 molecule .",
    "our @xmath5 emission model allows us to determine the @xmath10 conversion factor ( also called the x - factor or @xmath13 ) which is formally defined as @xmath14 i.e. , as the ratio between @xmath6 column density , @xmath15 , and the @xmath5 velocity integrated intensity , @xmath16 , of the @xmath12 rotational transition .",
    "as shown in paper i , the x - factor depends on the conditions of the ism , in particular on the dust - to - gas ratio and the gas surface density .",
    "hence , a crucial question that we address in this paper is whether the use of a constant value for @xmath13 , as done in many observational studies , introduces significant biases in the estimates of the slope and scatter of the @xmath3 relation .",
    "similarly , we use stellar population synthesis modeling to compute the fuv and @xmath17 fluxes of our model galaxies in order to assess whether the use of these star formation tracers leads to observational biases .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", the slope of the @xmath3 relation provides us with a means to distinguish between ( and potentially rule out ) different models of star formation . in general , the slopes of the @xmath3 relation and that of the underlying relation between the spatial densities of sfrs and @xmath6 , the @xmath18 relation , could be different due to variations in the gas scale height @xcite or changes in the density distribution @xcite .",
    "however , if the @xmath18 relation is linear , so is the @xmath3 relation @xcite .",
    "we note that a linear relation has been interpreted as evidence that star formation occurs in dense clumps within molecular clouds and that the number of such clumps scales with the total amount of molecular gas @xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility that has been suggested is that the timescale for star formation is controlled by small scale processes , e.g. , stellar feedback , ambipolar diffusion , etc . which do not vary much from one location to the next , and hence ensure a steady ( when averaged over sufficiently large spatial and temporal scales ) conversion of @xmath6 into stars @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a slope of @xmath19 can be explained by models that are based on a constant star formation efficiency per free - fall time @xcite . star formation driven by cloud - cloud collisions could lead to even steeper slopes @xcite .    while the slope of the @xmath3 relation has been the subject of a number of observational studies ,",
    "there is , unfortunately , no clear consensus yet on its exact value .",
    "while many studies find slopes that are close to unity ( @xmath20 , e.g. , @xcite ) , a number of works prefer a steeper slope , e.g. , @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "various factors may contribute to these differences , including choices in the fitting methodology , how star formation maps are corrected for dust extinction and diffuse emission , the resolution of the observations , or the range in surface densities over which the fit is done . in particular , assumptions about the amount of diffuse emission present in the star formation maps and its subsequent treatment in the data analysis have a strong impact on the derived slope @xcite .",
    "however , if the fitting is restricted to regions of sufficiently high @xmath1 , then the impact of any diffuse emission is minimized and the @xmath3 relation is found to be close to linear @xcite .    besides the slope , the normalization of the @xmath3 relation is an important parameter that needs to be matched by the theoretical models .",
    "fortunately , studies that find an approximatively linear slope of the @xmath3 relation also find little variation of the normalization ( @xmath24 @xmath25few gyr ) with galaxy mass or other global galaxy properties ( e.g. , ) .",
    "a notable exception is the claim that the normalization depends on the specific star formation rate @xcite , although there is a potential worry that this result is , to some extent at least , an artifact of the large scatter in the @xmath3 relation and the use of correlated quantities @xcite . driven by these observational findings we adopt in this paper a ( stochastic ) star formation model that is based on a linear @xmath18 relation with a constant gas depletion time of a few gyr .    lcccccr label & box size & @xmath26 & @xmath27 & [ @xmath28 & fixed ism & comments + mw - fid & 6 com .",

    "correspond to ( at best ) gmc scales , it is clear that we are not able to follow in any realistic detail the formation and evolution of individual bound star clusters , let along individual stars .",
    "hence , our approach is to marginalize over the complexities involved in star formation by describing star formation on a statistical level .",
    "such an approach will have its limitations , of course , and we are not aiming at reproducing observations perfectly , but rather try to isolate and explain some of the trends in the observational data .",
    "there are several lines of evidence suggesting that a statistical description of star formation is a plausible ansatz , at least on the level of star clusters and in relatively quiescently star - forming galaxies .",
    "one is the observation that the scaling between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is roughly linear and holds over a wide range of surface densities and galaxy metallicities @xcite , although it may break down in strongly out - of - equilibrium situations such a major galaxy mergers @xcite .",
    "another one is provided by the similarity of the shape of the mass function of young star clusters among non - starbursting galaxies , which indicates that the conversion of interstellar gas into star clusters proceeds on average in the same way in different galaxies with different global properties .",
    "also , the existence of a correlation between the total number of clusters and the luminosity of the most luminous cluster in a galaxy can be understood in a purely statistical formation scenario of star clusters @xcite .",
    "our model assumes that @xmath6 mass is a good tracer of the sfr @xcite and can be summarized by the following three statements : ( 1 ) star formation is a stochastic process and the number of individual star formation events pc in our simulations ) . ] in a given time interval is described by a homogeneous poisson process , ( 2 ) the _ average _ stellar mass formed per unit time is proportional to the present @xmath6 mass , and ( 3 ) the factor of proportionality , @xmath44 , is a constant . here , _",
    "average _ refers to the ensemble average over independent patches of the ism of the same size and with the same @xmath6 masses , which may , however , differ in other properties .",
    "in other words , we marginalize over most of the gmc parameters which may be potentially relevant for star formation and keep only the explicit dependence of the sfr on @xmath6 mass .",
    "we give a detailed description of the model in the appendix . here , we only summarize the properties that we will need later in the paper .",
    "the discreteness of star formation leads to scatter in the @xmath3 relation because the sfr that is realized in a given region and over a given period differs from the ensemble average sfr tied to the present @xmath6 mass .",
    "the scatter increases ( up to a point ) with increasing average time between individual star formation events , @xmath40 , but decreases with increasing life - time of a given star formation tracer @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , the scatter depends on these quantities only in form of the dimensionless ratio @xmath46 , the average number of individual star formation events during @xmath45 .",
    "our model contains three parameters : the average @xmath6 depletion time scale , @xmath47 , the spatial scale on which our model operates , @xmath48 , and @xmath40 .",
    "we fix @xmath47 to @xmath49 gyr in order to fit the observed normalization of the @xmath0 - @xmath1 relation , see  [ sect : sfrelations ] .",
    "we stress that @xmath47 is not the @xmath6 gas depletion time of individual star forming molecular clouds , but an average depletion time that includes the non star forming molecular gas .",
    "our model is assumed to operate on scales of @xmath50 pc scales , which is the peak resolution of our numerical simulations , see table  [ tab : sim ] .",
    "our default value for @xmath40 is 10 myr .",
    "this choice is based on the following considerations .",
    "first , the crossing time ( or the free - fall time ) of a molecular region should be a lower limit on the time period between two bursts of star formation in that region .",
    "this time @xmath51 can be estimated from the larson relation between cloud size @xmath52 and cloud velocity dispersion @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "it scales as @xmath54 and , hence , @xmath55 myr for regions of size @xmath50 pc .",
    "since the largest molecular cloud complexes in the milky way have radii of @xmath4 pc @xcite , this line of reasoning can not be used to constrain @xmath40 on larger spatial scales . despite having a similar numerical value on @xmath4 pc scales , @xmath40 and @xmath56",
    "are quite different physical quantities .",
    "in fact , @xmath56 , a measure of the _ duration _ of an individual star formation event , increases with scale , while @xmath40 , the period between successive star formation events , decreases with scale due to the smoothing effect of spatial averaging on poisson noise .",
    "secondly , we have checked that with the choice @xmath57 myr individual star formation events in the simulations cover a broad range of masses up to @xmath58 @xmath8 .",
    "the embedded star clusters that form during a star formation event of total mass @xmath58 @xmath8 will have masses up to , but not exceeding , @xmath59 @xmath8 for a reasonable choice of the slope of the embedded cluster mass function ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "this compares well with the fact that , at least in the milky way , young massive clusters exceeding @xmath61 @xmath8 are rare .    finally , @xmath62 myr is consistent with the observed relation between sfr and maximum embedded star cluster mass @xcite .",
    "we note that these considerations do not rule out a moderately larger value , e.g , @xmath63 myr .",
    "all simulations include a photo - chemical network , metal enrichment from supernova ( type ia and type ii ) , but no thermal energy injection , optically thin radiative cooling by hydrogen ( including @xmath6 ) , helium , and metal lines , and 3d radiative transfer of uv radiation .",
    "the details of the implementation can be found in @xcite and @xcite . here , we give a brief recount .",
    "the photo - chemical network in art follows the formation and destruction of the five major atomic and ionic species of hydrogen and helium .",
    "the formation of @xmath6 on dust grains and the destruction of @xmath6 via photo - dissociation in the lyman - werner bands are taken into account .",
    "the transfer of ionizing and non - ionizing uv radiation from stellar sources is computed in the otvet approximation @xcite .",
    "radiative stellar feedback is important for the heating and cooling balance of the gas and for the abundance of @xmath6 and co. unlike the re - ionized intergalactic medium , the dense interstellar medium within galaxies may well be opaque to ionizing photons of all but the nearest stars and radiative transfer effects can not be neglected .

    "[ fig : scat]a we plot the scatter of the @xmath3 relation as a function of spatial averaging scale and separate the contributions that result from the use of time - averaging tracers of star formation and uncertainties in @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the scatter is computed from all regions with an ( inferred ) @xmath6 column density between 10 and 100 @xmath8 pc@xmath9 , a @xmath5 velocity integrated intensity equal to or larger than @xmath64 k km s@xmath29 , and a minimum sfr surface density of @xmath65 @xmath8 yr@xmath29 kpc@xmath9 . these limits are chosen to roughly mimic typical values encountered in observational studies and it is clear that the exact numerical predictions will depend to some extent on these limits . in particular , the choice of the minimal @xmath0 is crucial , since the scatter is measured in @xmath66 space and , if not removed , regions with very low star formation would contribute enormously to the scatter ( even worse , regions with zero star formation would make the scatter formally infinite ) .",
    "our numerical modeling predicts that x - factor variations induce a scatter of the order of @xmath67 dex .",
    "[ fig : scat]a shows that this scatter may be relevant on scales @xmath25kpc and above , but on smaller scales the total scatter is primarily due to the use of time averaged sfrs , at least for our fiducial choice @xmath57 myr .",
    "again we stress that this analysis assumes that variations in the dust - to - gas ratio and @xmath5 brightness temperature are small or accounted for .",
    "[ fig : scat]a also shows that the scatter that results from the use of time - averaged sfrs is a strong function of scale .",
    "it reaches @xmath68 dex at @xmath4 pc , but is only @xmath69 dex at kpc scales .",
    "furthermore , there is little difference between the use of fuv luminosity - based sfrs and the use of the actual time - averaged sfr over the last 20 myr .",
    "hence , a varying fuv - to - stellar mass conversion factor ( see _ imperfect tracers _ above ) contributes little to the scatter .",
    "this rules out the suggestion by @xcite that the variation of the fuv luminosity over the lifetime of a single stellar population ( ssp ) dominates the scatter , at least on scales of @xmath4 pc and above .",
    "in fact , if the luminosity - weighted sfrs differ little from the time - averaged sfrs , e.g. , if sfrs are constant , then the luminosity evolution of the tracer becomes completely irrelevant .",
    "this can be seen from the following simple analysis .",
    "the total spectral luminosity from a lagrangian volume element at time @xmath70 is given as @xmath71 here , @xmath72 is the spectral luminosity from a ssp of unit mass and age @xmath70 .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the total spectral energy emitted by an ssp of unit mass and the luminosity weighted sfr , respectively . hence ,",
    "if time - averaged and luminosity weighted sfrs trace each other closely , then the constant @xmath75 is the perfect ( i.e. , scatter - free ) conversion factor between tracer luminosity and time - averaged sfr .",
    "the validity of this statement does not depend on the form of @xmath76 .",
    "we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : scat]b that the scatter in the @xmath3 relation depends on both the star formation tracer and the time discreteness parameter @xmath40 .",
    "we find that @xmath17-based sfr estimates lead to more scatter in the @xmath3 relation than the use of fuv flux as a tracer .",
    "hence , the star formation tracer with the shorter lifetime ( @xmath17 ) leads to larger scatter .",
    "similarly , when we estimate the sfr based on the actual stellar mass formed within the past 4 myr and the 20 myr , we find that the use of a shorter averaging time leads to more scatter in the @xmath3 relation .",
    "the averaging timescales of 4 and 20 myr correspond roughly to the luminosity weighted timescales of @xmath17 and fuv emission @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not entirely surprising that the scatter predictions computed using these time - averaged sfrs are similar to the predictions that use @xmath17 and fuv based tracers .",
    "it demonstrates that @xmath17 and fuv based tracers can , to a good degree of approximation , be treated as a top - hat filter with a width of @xmath77 myr and @xmath78 myr , respectively .",
    "this correspondence will break , however , if the scales are small enough and the lifetimes of the particular tracer short enough such that luminosity weighted sfrs and time - averaged sfrs begin to differ substantially . for @xmath17",
    "based sfr estimates this appears to happen on scales of @xmath79 pc , while for fuv based tracers the effect is small even on spatial averaging scales of @xmath4 pc .",
    "[ fig : scat]b also shows that the scatter depends on the average time between star formation events @xmath40 .",
    "as expected a shorter @xmath40 means that individual star formation events involve less stellar mass but occur at a higher rate , which reduces the scatter . the sharp drop in the scatter",
    "when @xmath40 is reduced to 1 myr proves that much of the scatter in our fiducial @xmath57 myr model arises from a single source , the discreteness of star formation . hence",
    ", observational estimates of the scatter can be used to put tight constraints on the value of @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , a systematic observational study of the scatter in the @xmath3 relation as function of ism environment would allow to determine whether ( and how ) @xmath40 depends on ism properties .    in order to assess",
    "how much of the total scatter is caused by time variations in the @xmath6 abundance ( and not related to time discreteness of star formation ) , we also show the scatter for a run with @xmath80 myr .",
    "this timescale is close to the smallest dynamical time step in our simulation and , hence , effectively eliminates any discreteness ( beyond that dictated by the simulation time step ) in the star formation model .",
    "we then measure the scatter in the true @xmath3 relation using time - averaged sfrs ( using 4 myr and 20 myr as averaging times ) . in this way we isolate the scatter that is caused by the observational actuality that sfrs are time - averaged quantities , but @xmath6 masses",
    "are observed at a particular instant .",
    "the scatter that results in this way is relatively small , see fig .",
    "[ fig : scat]b . on",
    "super - kpc scales it is dominated by the scatter that is caused by @xmath13 fluctuations and on sub - kpc scales by the scatter due to the discreteness of star formation .",

    "they contribute to the scatter caused by the discreteness of star formation and , hence , can not be neglected .    in @xcite we found that noise inserted by hand on small scales leads to scatter in the @xmath3 relation that decreases roughly as power law @xmath81 , where @xmath82 , with increasing spatial averaging scale @xmath83 .",
    "[ fig : scat]b shows that the scatter due to the stochastic nature of star formation follows this scaling approximatively . in particular",
    ", it is clearly less steep than a @xmath84 scaling which would be the naive expectation if the gas were arranged in disk of uniform density .",
    "as discussed in @xcite the scaling deviates from @xmath84 because the density distribution of the ism , determined by turbulence , is far from being uniform .",
    "how does the scatter that is predicted for our fiducial choice @xmath57 myr compare with observations ?",
    "such a comparison is not straightforward since observational estimates of the scatter depend on choices in the methodology .",
    "for instance , the treatment of diffuse emission does not only affect the inferred slope of the @xmath3 relation , but also the scatter .",

    "[ fig : scat ] .    to summarize",
    ", we find that for galaxies with milky - way like ism conditions most of the scatter in the @xmath3 relation is a consequence of the time discreteness of star formation .",

    "how does the star formation model presented in this paper relate to alternative interpretations of the scatter in the @xmath3 relation ?",

    "one of the difficulties with a picture in which most of the molecular gas in a galaxy goes through a well defined sequence of stages is the following .",
    "it does not explain why the @xmath6 depletion time of molecular clouds with embedded young stellar objects is only a few 100 myr @xcite , while the depletion time on galactic scales is an order of magnitude larger @xcite .",
    "in fact , this observation , originally used as evidence to support long lifetimes of molecular clouds @xcite , implies that the majority of the molecular gas in the galaxy has to be in a non - star forming state @xcite , possibly in either non - star forming clouds that will be dispersed before star formation has a chance to begin , or in unbound molecular associations .    the way our model addresses",
    "this problem is that the observed gas depletion time of a molecular _ and _ star forming region is smaller than the average depletion @xmath47 by a factor @xmath96 ( see appendix ) .",
    "observations of individual molecular clouds often derive sfrs based on counts of young stellar objects ( @xmath97 myr ) or by using tracers of ionizing radiation from massive stars ( @xmath98 few myr ) , e.g. , @xmath17 emission or free - free radio emission . consequently , @xmath99 myr and the observed gas depletion time in star forming regions is shorter than @xmath47 .",
    "this is balanced by the large ( formally infinite ) depletion time in molecular regions that are not currently star forming .",
    "it has also been suggested that the scatter in the @xmath3 relation is caused by variations in the ratio between molecular gas and _ dense _ ( @xmath100 @xmath101 ) molecular gas @xcite .",
    "since our model does not explicitly follow dense gas , such variations could be included as an additional stochastic component in the star formation model , see  [ sect : scatter ] .",
    "however , the tight correlation between dense gas and star formation in many different environments @xcite is suggestive of an alternative way . in the context of our model",
    "the only thing required is to re - interpret the word `` individual star formation event '' as `` individual dense gas formation event '' and to assume that , once gas becomes very dense , star formation is inevitable and will proceed on the @xmath25free - fall time of the respective dense gas clump .",
    "this modification of our model does not specify the physical mechanism for the sudden increase in gas density , but several plausible options exist , e.g. , cloud collisions @xcite .",
    "this re - interpretation of our star formation model accounts , by construction , for the observed tight correlation between dense gas and star formation rate .",
    "furthermore , the ratio between dense ( i.e. , star forming ) molecular gas and all molecular gas in a given region will vary depending on how many `` dense gas formation events '' have occurred in the region . in this model both",
    "the scatter in the @xmath3 relation and the scatter in the mass ratio between dense and not - so - dense gas on small scales are a consequence of the discrete formation of dense gas clumps out of molecular gas .",
    "further potential contributors to the scatter include the incomplete sampling of the imf and the drifting of stars out of their parent molecular clouds .",
    "these scatter sources are unlikely to be relevant given the relatively large spatial scales ( @xmath102 pc ) and sfr surface densities ( @xmath103 @xmath8 yr@xmath29 kpc@xmath9 ) in our study ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that in the context of our star formation model there is no `` break down '' of the @xmath3 scaling relation .",
    "instead , the proper interpretation is that the discrete and stochastic nature of star formation becomes evident as observations probe smaller and smaller scales .",
    "in this paper we studied the slope and the scatter of the @xmath3 relation using cosmological galaxy formation simulations coupled with models for star formation , @xmath6 chemistry , and @xmath5 emission .",
    "our focus is especially on the role of the @xmath10 conversion factor .",
    "we found that x - factor variations with surface density can result in significant biases of the measured slope .",
    "in particular , at high spatial resolution ( few 100 pc or better ) and sufficiently low surface densities ( @xmath104 ) the slope inferred from @xmath5 observations is shallower than the actual slope .",
    "in contrast , the inferred slope becomes steeper than the true slope if galaxies with high @xmath6 surface densities ( above @xmath105 @xmath8 pc@xmath9 ) are included in the sample , providing an possible explanation for the slightly super - linear slope of the @xmath3 relation seen at high gas surface densities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "yet , we also showed that measurements at @xmath106 pc resolution over a surface density range often studied in samples of nearby galaxies , @xmath107 , are essentially unbiased .",
    "variations in the x - factor contribute to the scatter in the @xmath3 relation ( of the order of @xmath67 dex ) , dominating over many other scatter sources when the spatial resolution of the survey is @xmath25kpc or larger .",
    "this even holds if there are no significant spatial variations of the dust - to - gas ratio or the interstellar radiation field .",
    "such variations are expected in a heterogeneous sample of galaxies , leading to additional galaxy - to - galaxy scatter with an amount that depends on the properties of the particular galaxy sample ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on sub - kpc scales , however , spatial variations in the @xmath10 conversion factor contribute little to the overall scatter ( assuming a fixed dust - to - gas ratio ) . on such scales",
    "much of the scatter is a consequence of the fact that the measured , time - averaged sfrs differ from the sfrs that are expected based on the present amount of @xmath6 .",
    "we demonstrated that the scatter in the @xmath3 relation ( on scales of @xmath4 pc and larger ) is primarily a consequence of the discreteness of the star formation process .",
    "the luminosity evolution of sfr tracers can become relevant for tracer with short lifetimes , e.g. , @xmath17 , on small scales ( less then a few 100 pc ) .",
    "for fuv - based sfrs , however , the scatter does not differ significantly from the scatter based on a hypothetical tracer with a plain 20 myr lifetime .",
    "the differences in the timescales between sfr tracers ( at least a few myr , up to 100 myr ) and that of @xmath6 masses ( essentially instantaneous measurements ) does lead to some scatter , but it is typically dominated by scatter that results from x - factor variations ( on super - kpc scales ) and by scatter due to the discreteness of star formation ( on sub - kpc scales ) .    the predictions made in the paper suggest a number of observational tests that could be used to constrain the presented numerical models .",
    "fortunately , most of the more obvious tests , e.g. , looking for a change in slope of the @xmath3 relation at very low and very high surface densities ( fig  [ fig : ks2]b , fig  [ fig : ksplot ] ) , should be feasible with future alma observation .",
    "a clear test of the predictions of the poisson star formation model should be possible with a systematic , observational study of how the scatter in the @xmath3 relation scales with spatial scale and how it depends on the lifetimes of star formation tracers .",
    "such a study would allow to constrain the discreteness of star formation and , more generally , would be a crucial guide for the development of the theoretical underpinnings of star formation in a galactic context .",

    "we give a more formal definition of the poisson star formation model introduced in ",
    "[ sect : sfmodel ] and describe its implementation in the art code .",
    "the model assumes that the number of individual star formation events @xmath108 in a given time interval @xmath109 is a poisson random variable with a mean and variance @xmath110 . here",
    ", @xmath40 is the average time interval between two star formation events .",
    "the continuum , non - stochastic limit corresponds to @xmath111 .",
    "the ensemble average sfr density in a given region is proportional to the @xmath6 density , i.e. , @xmath112 where the gas depletion time @xmath47 is assumed to be a constant .",
    "the ensemble average sfr in a given fixed volume @xmath113 is simply @xmath114 .",
    "we denote the time average of @xmath115 over some interval @xmath109 as @xmath116 .",
    "the actual sfr , @xmath117 , that occurred in the volume @xmath113 during the time interval @xmath109 is a _ random variable _ and defined as @xmath118 which ensures that the ensemble average of @xmath117 equals @xmath116 .",
    "this equations shows that the stellar mass formed during an individual star formation event is simply given by @xmath119 , i.e. , it scales linearly with the average sfr .",
    "the time interval @xmath109 may be some small , arbitrarily chosen time step .",
    "we are typically interested in measuring the mean and variance of the sfr ( or of its logarithm ) over some physical time interval @xmath120 , e.g. , over the lifetimes of star formation tracers such as @xmath121 or fuv emission .",
    "the actual sfr over @xmath45 is given by @xmath122 with indices @xmath123 running over the @xmath124 time intervals of length @xmath109 .",
    "it is worthwhile to have a closer look at ( [ eq : sdts ] ) .",
    "first , the expression on the right hand side implies that @xmath125 does not depend on the time step @xmath109 provided @xmath109 is sufficiently short compared with the typical time over which @xmath115 fluctuates .",
    "moments of @xmath125 and @xmath126 depend on the timescales @xmath40 and @xmath45 only via the ratio @xmath46 .",
    "the equation also allows us to estimate the @xmath6 depletion time @xmath127 that an observer would measure in a star forming region ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath6 density in the region remains constant during @xmath45 , then the depletion time that the observer would infer is @xmath129 , which is smaller than @xmath47 if @xmath130 .    equation ( [ eq : sdts ] ) further shows that @xmath125 depends in a non - linear way on both the time evolution of the @xmath6 mass in a given region and the number of individual star formation events .",
    "hence , we expect that the scatter in the @xmath3 relation that arises from the discreteness of star formation depends in a non - linear way on both the time variations in the @xmath6 mass and on poisson shot noise in the number of individual star formation events . to be quantitative let us approximate the scatter in the @xmath3 relation with @xmath131 , the standard deviation of the logarithm of @xmath132 .",
    "let us further assume that @xmath133 fluctuates over time @xmath45 as a log - normal random variable , i.e. , @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is a gaussian random variable with mean 0 and variance 1 .",
    "the choice @xmath136 myr , @xmath57 myr and @xmath137 results in @xmath138 . with the same set of parameters but @xmath111 we find @xmath139 .",
    "if we assume @xmath140 , i.e. , @xmath141 constant , we obtain @xmath142 . hence , the variance of @xmath126 is not simply the sum of the variances caused by poisson noise and @xmath6 fluctuations , respectively , but is determined to a large extent by their covariance . using this simple test setup",
    "we also find that the scaling of @xmath131 with @xmath46 depends on the value of @xmath53 , although , for sufficiently large @xmath46 , the scatter decreases with increasing @xmath46 .",
    "our simulations adopt the poisson star formation model in the following way .",
    "every @xmath143 yr the code computes the ensemble average sfr @xmath115 in each resolution element ( @xmath144 pc , see table  [ tab : sim ] ) based on the present @xmath6 mass .",
