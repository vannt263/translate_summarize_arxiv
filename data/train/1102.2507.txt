    "it would be interesting to perform spin  sensitive tunneling spectroscopy on these samples since , according to fig .",
    "[ fig : pflip ] , such a measurement gives more detailed information about the bias dependence of ferromagnetic ordering than the i - v curve and its derivatives .",
    "this can test the prediction that ferromagnetic order which can be achieved at zero bias is destroyed near resonance would be verified , and that electric switching back and forth between the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state can be achieved .",
    "we now explore feasibility of selective magnetization switching among several magnetic layers of high structural quality .",
    "we investigate a three - barrier structure with two adjacent gamnas quantum wells , choosing an asymmetric structure with the second well being thinner than the first one ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) .",
    "all other parameters are as in the previous structure .",
    "quantum confinement gives rise to a higher ground state energy in the second quantum well at zero bias .",
    "the resonant alignment of the ground state subbands of the two wells is therefore achieved at a finite voltage as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : ivqws ] , corresponding to the first maximum in the current - voltage characteristics at about @xmath127 v which is plotted in fig .  [ fig : ivqws ] .",
    "the second current maximum result from the resonance of the first excited state subbands of both wells .",
    "next to possible exchange splitting the finite separating barriers cause the energy levels in the two quantum wells to further split into bonding and antibonding subband states .",
    "however , for our structure the middle barrier is too thick and the natural energy broadening of the quasi ",
    "bound states is too large for resolving this additional splitting in the local density of states .",
    "having two coupled quantum wells allows one to realize several magnetic configurations . the maximum ( steady  state ) exchange splitting of the two wells as a function of the applied bias is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dqws ] , revealing three different regions . for low voltages",
    "both wells are magnetized due to the build  up of spin polarization in the wells due to resonance of the ground state subband levels with populated reservoir states .",
    "exchange causes a relative shift in the density of states for spin  up and spin  down holes which , in turn , stabilizes ferromagnetism in both layers .",
    "when the second well goes off resonance at around @xmath128 v the accumulated spin polarization in the second well is preserved , since for voltages up to @xmath129 v the collector fermi energy @xmath59 is still higher than the bottom of its ground state subbands thus maintaining spin polarization . for voltages in the interval @xmath130",
    "v@xmath131 v the first well remains magnetic , whereas the second well becomes nonmagnetic , since the ground state subbands are no longer filled from the collector side . at sufficiently high bias , @xmath132 v ,",
    "also the first well becomes demagnetized since holes can no longer resonantly populate its two lowest ( now degenerate ) subbands from either emitter or collector thus resulting in a completely nonmagnetic structure .",
    "several simplifying assumptions have been made in the present analysis which should , just as well as experimental aspects , be discussed .",
    "the present model is based on an effective - mass - like two  band approach for the heavy holes in the structure .",
    "this approximation should at least qualitatively be correct since the applied bias is kept below typically 0.2  v and most of the phenomena discussed here occur at lower bias .",
    "thus it can be expected , that this model describes effects qualitatively correct .",
    "we are currently working on more realistic tight  binding formulations using a significantly increased number of basis states in conjunction with density functional plus dynamic mean - field models to arrive at a more detailed and realistic electronic structure.@xcite impurity scattering effects have been accounted for on a phenomenological level within the tb model . our ballistic model neglects electron  phonon scattering within the heterostructure altogether and the electron ",
    "electron interaction is described within mean  field theory . in thin structures , such as the ones studied here where effective tunneling rates are higher than carrier ",
    "phonon scattering rates and optical phonon transitions are suppressed energetically the former assumption should be rather well fulfilled and not alter significantly subband population within the heterostructure .",
    "electron  electron scattering may play role , however , as long as it does not involve spin ",
    "flip processes should not influence our basic conclusions much .",
    "clearly the effects studied here require low temperatures , for one to favor ferromagnetic ordering and , secondly , to preserve strong hole ",
    "spin polarization in the carrier injection process .",
    "it is well known that , at least at low temperatures , structural imperfections are the main source for reduction of nonlinear effects , such as the peak  to  valley  ratio in the iv curve.@xcite it is most likely the difficulty in clean sample preparation which has slowed experimental progress on thin  layer semimagnetic semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "high quality doping profiles and high quality interfaces must be achieved within one growth process.@xcite growth of good quality dms layers needs low temperature molecular beam epitaxy which , however , adversely affects interface quality . usually thin gaas spacer layers are inserted to smooth the surfaces.@xcite furthermore , gamnas layers must be thick enough to support ferromagnetism .",
    "qualitatively , all structural imperfections lead to broadening of resonances . once the latter becomes comparable to the ( theoretical ) maximum of the exchange energy induced spin  splitting , spin  selective tunneling and , hence , tunneling ",
    "induced control of magnetic ordering may be suppressed . even in the presence of disorder ,",
    "as long as it does not go hand in hand with strong spin  flip processes , achieving bias  control of hole ",
    "spin polarization in the gamnas layers should allow one to manipulate magnetization .",
    "in summary , we have used a ballistic steady  state transport model to investigate bias  induced magnetic multi  stability in algaas / mngaas quantum well structures .",
    "ferromagnetic exchange , as well as the hole coulomb interaction are treated within self  consistent mean  field approximation .",
    "substitutional disorder is treated phenomenologically within a tight  binding model .",
    "our studies indicate that in these systems ferromagnetic ordering can be controlled selectively by an externally applied bias .",
    "the underlying mechanism is found in spin  selective tunneling due to the anti  ferromagnetic exchange interaction between itinerant heavy holes and localized mn d  electrons . in structurally suitably designed heterostructures",
    "the applied electric bias allows control of the ferromagnetic state , as well as electric and spin current density .    in the simplest structural case in form of a double barrier structure containing a gamnas well",
    ", we predict that ferromagnetic ordering in the well , when present at zero bias , is lost under bias near the first heavy - hole resonance , allowing a switching back and forth between the magnetic and nonmagnetic state in the well . in gamnas",
    "multi - well structures we predict that the loss of ferromagnetic order can be engineered structurally to occur at different applied bias for the individual layers .    within our model",
    "we are able to provide a possible explanation for the absence of exchange splitting near resonances , as observed in recent tunneling spectroscopy measurements on thin gamnas layers.@xcite we generally predict that ferromagnetic order which may be achieved in gamnas quantum well layers under zero bias tends to be destroyed under resonance condition since the well region then is swept by unpolarized holes . under favorable conditions detailed in the main text , ferromagnetic order may be reestablished above resonance .",
    "such a behavior should be revealed experimentally by spin ",
    "sensitive tunneling spectroscopy.@xcite    in previous work based on a complementary time ",
    "dependent sequential tunneling model including intra ",
    "well scattering we have predicted that , under specific bias conditions , the interplay of transport and magnetic properties can result in robust self - sustained charge and magnetization oscillations.@xcite the present model , albeit based on the resonant  tunneling picture , backs the possibility of such phenomena by predicting bias regions in which no steady  state solution for the current exists .",
    "disorder and spin  flip effects have been modeled on a phenomenological level .",
    "we find that disorder due to mn taking a ga site alone should not suffice to destroy spin  selective tunneling , nor should spin flips at a rate expected in these structures , for example from the spin  orbit interaction , significantly suppress spin polarization of the steady  state current .",
    "as expected , our analysis does show that disorder and spin flip processes do reduce the total average current spin polarization , however , not as efficiently as the resonance peaks in the i  v curve .",
    "we conclude that multi ",
    "well structures containing gamnas layers may allow one to realize various bias - dependent magnetic configurations .",
    "while the current investigation of bias induced effects considers only bias in longitudinal direction , i.e. , a 2terminal configuration , applying additional gates in transverse direction ( multi  terminal configuration ) should allow for an additional control knob to move spin ",
