    "combinatorial alexander duality is a special case of the original alexander duality :    ( alexander @xcite , 1922 ) let @xmath15 be a subset of the sphere @xmath16 , such that the pair @xmath17 is triangulable . then @xmath18    the connection is the following : suppose that @xmath0 is a simplicial complex different from the full simplex with ground set @xmath19 .",

    "see @xcite or @xcite for context and modern treatments , and @xcite for interesting historical information about james waddell alexander , the man and his mathematics .",
    "the modest task of this article is to make the ideas behind combinatorial alexander duality more widely accessible by giving a `` combinatorial '' proof from first principles , not relying on more general techniques .",
    "central to our approach is a poset point of view and scrutiny of the combinatorics of the sign labeling of edges in the boolean lattice @xmath30 used for the ( co)boundary operations in ( co)homology . applications of combinatorial alexander duality in combinatorics and algebra can be found for example in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "combinatorial alexander duality exists in more general versions .",
    "one such generalization involves induced subcomplexes of @xmath0 versus links of faces of @xmath5 , see @xcite . for another one ,",

    "then theorem [ adthm ] still holds , see e.g. @xcite for an application .",
    "furthermore , a very general alexander duality theorem for nonacyclic gorenstein complexes appears in @xcite .",
    "the reason that we confine this article to the particular simplicial setting of theorem [ adthm ] , although the idea of the proof is correct in greater generality , is that we want to work with the explicit sign labeling offered by the environment of the boolean lattice .",
    "let @xmath0 be a simplicial complex with ground set @xmath34 . for @xmath35",
    "we define the _ sign _ @xmath36 as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the @xmath3-th smallest element of the set @xmath39 .",

    "then @xmath67 can be rewritten as : @xmath72    one of the important properties of relative homology groups is that they fit into a  long exact sequence .",

    "let @xmath75 be the lattice of all subsets of @xmath1 , and let @xmath76 be the subposet of @xmath75 corresponding to the subsets that are in  @xmath0 .",

    "thus , we restate the problem as computing homologies of the chain complex determined by the complement of @xmath76  in the sense of remark  [ relhom ] .",
    "the idea of the proof is that if we turn the lattice upside down ( exchange @xmath79 with its complement ) , then this combinatorial map on generators should induce a canonical isomorphism between the relative homology of the pair @xmath80 and the cohomology of @xmath5 .",
    "this idea is basically correct ; however , the mapping is not an isomorphism as described  some sign operations are necessary .",
