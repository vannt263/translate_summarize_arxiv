    "lvy processes are fundamental models of markov processes , from which more general diffusion - jump - type markov processes can be constructed by solving stochastic differential equations or martingale problems .",
    "it is well known that a lvy process can be decomposed into two independent parts , that is , the brownian ( or gaussian ) part and the jump part . comparing with the analysis on the brownian motion , that on the pure jump part is far from complete .",
    "for instance , except for stable - like processes that can be treated as subordinations of diffusion processes @xcite ( see also @xcite for heat kernel upper bounds for @xmath19-stable processes with drifts ) , little is known concerning regularities of the transition probabilities of o  u - type jump processes .",
    "most existing regularity results for o  u ( or generalized mehler ) semigroups were derived by using the gaussian part as the leading term ( cf . @xcite and references within ) .",
    "in contrast , besides known results on the transition density for lvy processes ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the strong feller property was recently proved by priola and zabczyk @xcite for o  u jump processes by considering a hrmander condition and lvy measures .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate more regular properties on o  u semigroups in the same spirit , so that our results work well for the pure jump case as emphasized in the abstract .",
    "recall that a lvy measure @xmath7 on @xmath20 is such that @xmath21 and ( see @xcite ) @xmath22 let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be a non - negatively definite @xmath25 matrix .",
    "the underlying lvy process @xmath6 is the markov process on @xmath20 generated by @xmath26 which is well defined for @xmath27 .",
    "now , let @xmath2 be a real @xmath3 matrix and @xmath4 be a real @xmath28 matrix .",
    "we shall investigate the solution to the following linear stochastic differential equation @xmath29 we shall investigate the following properties of the solution :    a.   the coupling property .",
    "b.   the harnack inequality and ultracontractivity . c.   the strong feller property .",
    "the coupling method is a powerful tool in the study of markov processes , and the coupling property that we are going to study is closely related to long - time behaviors , liouville - type properties and the 01 law of tail-/shift - invariant events .",
    "recall that a couple @xmath30 is called a coupling of the markov process associated with a given transition probability if both @xmath31 and @xmath32 are markov processes associated with the same transition probability ( possibly with different initial distributions ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are called the marginal processes of the coupling .",
    "a  coupling @xmath30 is called successful if the coupling time @xmath33 a markov process is said to have a coupling property ( or to have successful couplings ) if , for any initial distributions @xmath34 and @xmath35 there exists a successful coupling with marginal processes starting from @xmath34 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "a slightly weaker notion is the shift - coupling property : for any two initial distributions there exists a coupling @xmath30 with marginal processes starting from them respectively , such that `` @xmath37 '' holds for some finite stopping times @xmath38 ( see @xcite ) . in general , the coupling property is stronger than the shift - coupling property , but they are equivalent if the markov semigroup satisfies a weak parabolic harnack inequality ( see @xcite ) .",
    "consider a strong markov process with transition semigroup @xmath39 .",
    "for any ( not necessarily successful ) coupling with initial distributions @xmath34 and @xmath36 , one has ( see @xcite ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the total variational norm .",
    "this follows by setting @xmath42 for @xmath43 due to the strong markov property . moreover , for any coupling @xmath30 with initial distributions @xmath44 and @xmath45 , a bounded harmonic function @xmath46 ( i.e. @xmath47 for @xmath48 ) satisfies @xmath49 consequently , if a strong markov process has a coupling property , then its bounded harmonic functions have to be constant , that is , the liouville property holds for bounded harmonic functions . in general , the coupling property of a strong markov process on @xmath50 with semigroup @xmath39 is equivalent to each of the following statements ( see @xcite , section [ sec4 ] , and @xcite , chapters 3 and 5 ) :    a.   for any @xmath51 b.   all bounded time ",
    "space harmonic functions are constant , that is , a bounded measurable function @xmath52 on @xmath53 has to be constant if @xmath54 holds for all @xmath55 c.   the tail @xmath56-algebra of the process is trivial , that is , @xmath57 holds for any initial distribution and any @xmath58    correspondingly , each of the following statements are equivalent to the shift - coupling property ( see @xcite , section [ sec4 ] , or @xcite ) :    a.   for any @xmath59 .",
    "b.   all bounded harmonic functions are constant .",
    "c.   the shift - invariant @xmath56-algebra of the process is trivial , that is , @xmath60 for any initial distribution and any shift - invariant measurable set @xmath61 .    in section [ sec3 ] , we shall present explicit conditions on @xmath62 and the lvy measure @xmath7 such that the coupling property holds ( see theorem [ t3.1 ] ) .",
    "next , we aim to establish the following harnack inequality for @xmath39 initiated in @xcite for diffusion semigroups : @xmath63 for positive measurable functions @xmath46 , where @xmath64 is a positive function on @xmath65    when @xmath66 , with a positive probability the process does not jump before a fixed time @xmath67 , so that this inequality could not hold for the pure jump case .",
    "this is the main reason why all existing results in this direction only work for the case with a non - degenerate gaussian part ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . to work out the harnack inequality also for the pure jump case",
    ", we shall be restricted on the event that the process jumps before time @xmath18 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath68 be the first jump time of the lvy process induced by an absolutely continuous part of @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath69 , then the harnack inequality and ultracontractivity are investigated in section [ sec4 ] for the following modified sub - markov operator @xmath70 ( see theorem [ t4.1 ] ) : @xmath71    finally , we look at the strong feller property of @xmath39 . by the same reasoning that leads to the invalidity of the harnack inequality , when @xmath7 is finite the pure jump semigroup can not be strong feller . therefore , in @xcite the authors only considered the case that @xmath7 is infinite . more precisely ,",
    "if @xmath7 has an infinite absolutely continuous part and if there exists @xmath72 such that the rank condition @xmath73 holds , then @xcite , theorem 1.1 and proposition 2.1 , imply the strong feller property of @xmath39 .",
    "we shall extend this result by allowing the absolutely continuous part of @xmath7 to be finite . in this case the number @xmath74 in the rank condition will refer to the strong feller property of the semigroup conditioned by the event that the @xmath74th jump happens before time @xmath67 ( see theorem [ t5.1 ] ) .",
    "it might be interesting to indicate that for jump processes the strong feller property is incomparable with the coupling property .",
    "indeed , the latter is a long - time property but the former is somehow a short - time property . for the strong feller property , we need the process to be able to visit any area before any fixed time , for which the jump measure has to be infinite as mentioned above .",
    "however , the situation in the diffusion case is very different : whenever the diffusion process is able to visit any area for a long time , it will be able to do so before any fixed time .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . to study the coupling property and the harnack inequality",
    ", we shall first investigate in section [ sec2 ] the quasi - invariance of random shifts for compound poisson processes , which in particular leads to a conditional girsanov theorem .",
    "then we will study the properties included in ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) in sections [ sec3 ] , [ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] , respectively .",
