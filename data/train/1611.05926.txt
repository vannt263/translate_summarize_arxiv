    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     at the crystal surface of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , the lattice structure is distorted along _",
    "c_-axis due to the abrupt reduction of the interlayer van der waals force that binds the crystal together .",
    "the surface distortion was calculated by density functional theory ( dft ) to be about 10% along @xmath7-axis , and depicted in ref .  .",
    "additionally , the observation of two - dimensional electron gas formed on bi@xmath0se@xmath1 surface is consistent with the subsurface van der waals gap expansion  @xcite .",
    "as the lattice is distorted , the frequencies of atomic vibration modes at the surface are usually modified to a smaller value than in the bulk at the brillouin zone center ( @xmath8 point )  @xcite .",
    "if there is a gap in the phonon density - of - state ( dos ) and with large enough distortion , the surface phonon dos can be entirely separated from the bulk  @xcite .",
    "such modes are long lived and localized at the surface , where the dispersion can be quite different than the bulk .    in bi@xmath0se@xmath1",
    ", there are some residual phonon dos in the entire energy range  @xcite , and the surface modes can decay into bulk phonon modes . if the frequency shift is small , where the dos of the surface mode is not entirely separated from the bulk , then strictly speaking a localized surface mode does not exist .",
    "instead , one would only expect a `` surface resonance '' , which is only distinguishable from the bulk phonon by the slightly lower energy .",
    "due to inversion symmetry breaking at the crystal interface , the surface resonance from the raman active @xmath3 and ir active @xmath4 phonons are both expected to appear in the @xmath9 symmetry ( @xmath6 group ) , corresponding to out - of - plane atomic motion .",
    "this is consistent with the 4 @xmath9 modes we observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) ) . from the energies of these @xmath9 modes",
    ", we conclude that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are associated with the bulk phonon modes @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the measured energy of the @xmath10 mode is somewhat different than the previously reported value of 68@xmath2 by time resolved arpes in ref .  .",
    "this may be partly due to surface quality variation .",
    "arpes measured sample is usually cleaved in ultra high vacuum , whereas the surface in this study is cleaved in nitrogen environment .",
    "this may also explain why this mode was never observed in the thin film samples ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , where the sample is unavoidably exposed to air for a few minutes during the transfer between mbe chamber and raman cryostat .",
    "the @xmath11 mode appears as a shoulder to the @xmath13 bulk phonon , requiring higher resolution to distinguish from the bulk mode , and therefore was overlooked in the previous raman study  @xcite .    in comparison ,",
    "the surface modes @xmath14 and @xmath15 have higher intensity and are better resolved .",
    "one possibility for this difference is that the bulk counterpart of these modes are the ir active @xmath16 and @xmath17 phonons , as the measured energy is close to the calculated values ( table  [ table : mode ] ) .",
    "since these bulk modes are raman inactive , we were able to better resolve the surface resonance .",
    "another possibility is that the phonon dos is practically zero at these energies in the @xmath9 symmetry channel , and the surface vibration modes are truly localized .",
    "distinguishing these two scenarios is in fact experimentally non - trivial , especially since the experimental values of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 bulk phonon energies are yet unknown .",
    "nevertheless , both possibilities point to the surface origin of these two modes , which may provide us with information on the electron - phonon coupling at the ti surface .",
    "in particular , the double peak line shape of the @xmath15 phonon mode was overlooked in previous raman studies and may be related to the 20mev `` kink '' in the topological surface state s energy dispersion curve reported by arpes measurements  @xcite . on the other hand , while the bulk phonons show little resonance effect , the @xmath15 phonon displays antisymmetric line shape with near - infrared excitation ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , inset ) .",
    "this suggests that there are surface electronic dos that appear under resonance excitation with near - infrared wavelength  @xcite , which interacts with the @xmath15 phonon and results in the observed fano line shape  @xcite . since the in - plane symmetries",
    "are mainly preserved as the dft calculated atomic surface distortion is purely out - of - plane  @xcite , one would not expect any surface phonon with @xmath18 symmetry ( @xmath6 group ) for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "however , the in - plane bonding potential is also modified by having distortion along _ c_-axis , and therefore the phonon frequency at surface is still slightly different than the bulk value .",
    "if the modification is tiny , the @xmath18 modes are expected to be weak and close to the bulk phonons . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) , we can see hints of two additional modes , labeled by @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the energies of these modes are in fact close to the measured values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 bulk phonons  @xcite , and are consistent with the previous raman study  @xcite ( table  [ table : mode ] ) .",
    "however , the frequency of @xmath23 is slightly higher than @xmath21 , which is against the expectation from a surface resonance .",
    "this may reflect the fact that this is an in - plane mode , orthogonal to the lattice distortion direction . or",
    ", this may be indicative of non - trivial electron - phonon interaction with the surface states , and worth further studying .",
    "in conclusion , we have done a systematic symmetry analysis on the raman spectra from high quality , freshly cleaved or grown _ ab _ surfaces of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 single crystal and thin films .",
    "we observed 4 out - of - plane and possibly 2 in - plane surface vibrational modes .",
    "the much larger intensity for the out - of - plane vibration modes is consistent with @xmath7-axis lattice distortion and van der waals gap expansion calculated for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 crystal surface  @xcite .",
    "the energies of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 modes are close to the bulk @xmath3 phonons . due to the smallness of calculated crystal surface distortion  @xcite and the lack of phonon dos gap  @xcite , these modes are likely not fully localized or separated from bulk phonon dos",
    ". however , the @xmath14 and @xmath15 modes are much stronger and sharper compared to the other vibration modes , and may be candidates of localized surface phonons .",
    "in particular , we found an anomalous double peak and fano lineshape for the @xmath15 mode , both in low doped bi@xmath0se@xmath1 single crystals .",
    "the fano lineshape is usually indicative of electron - phonon coupling , important for understanding the relaxation and scattering of surface state excitations . here",
    ", we found that the fano lineshape is dependent of the excitation energy , which may be able to explain the inconsistent surface electron - phonon coupling constant found in previous arpes studies  @xcite .",
