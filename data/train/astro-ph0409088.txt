    "the median /optical flux ratios for the soft sources follow the log@xmath84 loci for fluxes larger than @xmath85 , but drop to smaller /optical ratios at fainter fluxes .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the explanation for this is straightforward . at bright soft fluxes ,",
    "the agns usually dominate the and optical light , so the galaxies follow a constant /optical flux ratio . at fainter fluxes , the starlight begins to dominate over the optical agn contributions , possibly as a result of obscuration , an increase in the number of intrinsically lower luminosity agns , or , at the faintest fluxes , an increase in the number of galaxies without agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since stars contribute less than the agns to the emission , the result is a drop in the /optical flux ratios .",
    "in addition , any intrinsic obscuration will also attenuate the soft emission from the central engine . for near compton - thick agns ,",
    "all of the soft and optical agn light will be attenuated .",
    "the @xmath2-magnitudes shown in figure  [ r_mag_vs_sb ] are not nuclear magnitudes , so they differ from the optical/ studies done of nearby seyfert galaxies .",
    "we use a fixed aperture for our photometric measurements that covers a varying fraction of the optical counterpart .",
    "this fraction is dependent on the apparent angular size of the optical source and can vary between the nuclear magnitude for nearby sources and the total magnitude for high - redshift sources .",
    "this introduces a scatter in the y - axis of figure  [ r_mag_vs_sb ] , because a high - redshift source will have a brighter optical magnitude than its low - redshift twin .",
    "since most of our sources have small angular sizes ( see figure  [ thumbnails ] ) , our @xmath2-band magnitudes can be considered upper limits to the nuclear @xmath2-band magnitudes . in other words , if we could measure only the nuclear magnitudes for the clasxs sources , then the observed @xmath2-band magnitudes would decrease .",
    "this would shift many clasxs sources away from the quiescent galaxies regime and into the agn regime .",
    "the presence of an obscuring torus can affect the /optical flux ratio of a source , depending on which band we examine . since a photon s cross - section decreases rapidly with increasing photon energy , light from the near - infrared to soft is typically attenuated in moderately obscured agns , while hard light penetrates all but the most obscured sources .",
    "figure  [ fr_vs_hr ] shows the @xmath75  kev to @xmath2-band and @xmath6  kev to @xmath2-band flux ratios versus soft - to - hard flux ratio for the clasxs soft and hard selected samples .",
    "the samples were further separated by hard flux into bright ( @xmath86 ) and faint ( @xmath87 ) categories .",
    "the filled squares denote broad - line agns ( blagns ) .",
    "the large diamonds are the average @xmath88 within the soft - to - hard flux ratio ranges of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "we expect that for the @xmath75  kev /optical flux ratio , the presence of any obscuring material will attenuate both the soft and optical photons , making the flux ratio only weakly dependent on the column density for unobscured to moderately obscured sources .",
    "moreover , for highly obscured sources , the agn contribution to both the observed soft and optical light should become negligible , causing the galaxy to descend into the `` quiescent galaxy '' category .",
    "if we treat the soft - to - hard flux ratio as an approximation to the line - of - sight column density ( column density would decrease with increasing soft - to - hard flux ratio ) , we can see from figure  [ fr_vs_hr ] that the soft /optical flux ratio _ ( top row ) _ does indeed remain relatively constant for @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , at larger column densities , where both the optical and the soft light are obscured , there may be a slight drop in the soft /optical flux ratio as the agn contributions to both become negligible and the optical starlight from the galaxy begins to dominate .",
    "in contrast , we expect that moderate column densities of material will not significantly attenuate the hard photons from an agn , so moderately obscured sources will have high hard /optical flux ratios . from figure  [ r_mag_vs_sb ] _",
    "( bottom row ) _ , we see that as the column density increases , the agn s optical light is blocked , while the hard can still penetrate the material .",
    "thus , the hard /optical flux ratio increases until the material becomes opaque to hard . at these high column densities ,",
    "even the light is absorbed , and we would expect to see the /optical flux ratio begin to drop",
    ". however , near - compton - thick sources are very weak and difficult to detect , and there may be very few of them in the sample .",

    "b_-magnitudes for sources with @xmath120 . beyond this redshift ,",
    "the rest - frame _ b_-band moves redward beyond our @xmath4 observations . only non - stellar sources with measured magnitudes in at least two wavebands are included .",
    "blagns and non - blagns are shown as solid and hatched histograms , respectively .",
    "our photometric data do not have the resolution necessary to separate the luminosity of the host galaxy from that of the central agn , so we can only comment on the combined agn+host luminosity .",
    "since blagns have an excess blue continuum , one would expect a larger number of blagns at brighter absolute _ b _ magnitudes .",
    "indeed , figure  [ abs_b_dist ] shows that this is the case .",
    "in figures  [ redshift_flux]_a _ and [ redshift_flux]_b _ , we plot redshift versus soft and hard flux for the combined samples of   5 .",
    "the data and symbols are identical to those in figure  [ r_mag_vs_sb ] .",
    "the clasxs data nicely fill in the intermediate flux interval between the deep _ chandra _ data and the shallower _ asca _ and _ rosat _ data .",
    "the dashed lines show the median redshifts of the combined samples versus soft and hard flux .",
    "the median redshifts remain around @xmath121 and do not appear to be strongly correlated with either soft or hard flux .",
    "of course , the redshift determinations depend on the optical magnitudes of the sources .",
    "since the magnitudes of high - redshift sources may be faint , these surveys might be biased against finding high - redshift sources .",
    "the solid lines denote constant rest - frame luminosities , which were calculated assuming a @xmath31 power - law spectral energy distribution with no absorption .",
    "they range from @xmath122 to @xmath123  ergs  s@xmath15 ; the two largest luminosities are labeled .",
    "any source more luminous than @xmath124  ergs  s@xmath15 is very likely to be an agn on energetic grounds @xcite , though many of the intermediate luminosity sources do not show obvious agn signatures in their optical spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use the hard fluxes and redshifts of the combined samples in figure  [ redshift_flux]_b _ to calculate the rest - frame hard luminosities . as in   2 , we assume a power law spectral energy distribution with @xmath31 for calculating the _ k_-corrections to determine the rest - frame hard luminosities . using a universal power law index rather than individual indices to calculate the _",
    "k_-corrections results in only a small difference in the calculated luminosities @xcite .",
    "figure  [ lum_z ] shows the rest - frame hard luminosities for the hard sources and limiting fluxes of the clasxs , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite catalogs .",
    "the clasxs sample has the largest number of @xmath125 sources .",
    "even with the increased solid angle covered by the five surveys , there is an obvious lack of extremely luminous ( @xmath126 ) agns at @xmath113 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity , @xmath127 , of an agn is related to the rate of accretion , @xmath128 , onto its supermassive black hole using the expression @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the speed of light and @xmath131 is the accretion efficiency ( typically , @xmath132 ) . because agns are luminous from radio to energies , multiwavelength observations are needed to accurately calculate their bolometric luminosities .",
    "if we use a bolometric correction of 35 @xcite appropriate for the type i agns to translate hard luminosity , @xmath133 , to @xmath127 and assume an efficiency of @xmath134 , then we can roughly estimate the accretion rates .",
    "the results are shown in figure  11 _ ( right - hand axis)_. the small solid angle of the cdf - n survey prevented @xcite from determining if the lack of low redshift , high luminosity sources in their sample were due to an actual deficiency of these sources at low redshifts or simply a selection effect owing to the small local volume sampled and the low spatial density of these sources .",
    "clasxs samples a larger local cosmological volume to better constrain the accretion rate at low redshifts , and we can now clearly see that the deficiency of these sources is indeed real and that at @xmath113 there are very few sources with accretion rates above a solar mass per year .",
    "we have presented optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the sources in the clasxs survey .",
    "we obtained @xmath135 photometry for 521 of the 525 sources in the sample .",
    "we spectroscopically observed 467 of the clasxs sources , obtaining redshift identifications for 271 .",
    "the positions of the sources in our optical catalog agree well with the catalog , with average astrometric offsets of @xmath65 arcseconds in both right ascension and declination .    using our optical data ,",
    "we have examined the relationship between the and optical source properties .",
    "we find that the average soft to  optical flux ratio remains relatively constant for clasxs sources with low to moderate column densities of obscuring material .",
    "conversely , the hard to  optical flux ratio for these sources appears to be correlated with line - of - sight column density .",
    "because of the large solid angle covered by clasxs , we do not find the low - redshift structures that are seen in narrower , deeper _ chandra _ surveys .",
    "however , we do detect a possible excess of sources at @xmath101 . using hard catalogs from five _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "surveys we find that there is a distinct lack of luminous , high - accretion rate sources at low redshifts ( @xmath136 , consistent with previous observations which showed that supermassive black hole growth is dominated at low redshifts by sources with low accretion rates @xcite .",
