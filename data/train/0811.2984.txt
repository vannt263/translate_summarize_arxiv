    "although this limit can be proved to contain the solution set , the inclusion @xmath80\\subseteq \\mathrm{int}[{{\\bf x}}_k]$ ] will never be satisfies because this iteration somehow translates and inflates the initial approximation @xmath74 .",
    "it is more practical to additionally inflate each iterate of a fixed ration @xmath81 so as to obtain the inclusion @xmath80\\subseteq \\mathrm{int}[{{\\bf x}}_k]$ ] after a finite number of steps , and hence prove the inclusion of the solution set .",
