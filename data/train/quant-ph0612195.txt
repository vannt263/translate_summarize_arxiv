    "in the past few years josephson junctions - based devices have been widely studied both theoretically and experimentally as possible candidates for the implementation of a quantum computer @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in fact , under appropriate values of external bias pulses , they behave as two - state systems which can be used as a model for quantum bits  ( qubits ) .",
    "several systems like ion traps and nmr systems @xcite , @xcite have been suggested for physical realizations of the qubit but josephson devices being scalable up to large numbers of qubits as nanocomponents embedded into an electronic circuit exhibit the main technological advantage .",
    "moreover , it is possible to prepare these devices in a prefixed initial state or in a superposition of states and to control their dynamics by an external voltage and magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "one common approach to control the qubit dynamics is to drive the two - state system , i.e. a particle in a double well potential , with an oscillating field . as a result",
    "an interesting phenomenon may take place .",
    "instead of oscillating between the wells the particle may become localized in one of them .",
    "such an unusual behavior of the quantum particle is known in the literature as coherent destruction of tunneling in double - well potential studies @xcite-@xcite , dynamic localization in transport analysis @xcite ,  @xcite and population trapping in laser - atom physics @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that up to now the phenomenon was essentially related with an oscillating character of the driving external field .    in the present article",
    "we show that the oscillating character of the field is not compulsory for appearance of the phenomenon .",
    "we present a class of non - periodical time - dependent bias pulses leading to a similar behavior of the qubit .",
    "a qubit in the two - state approximation can be described ( see e.g. @xcite ,",
    "@xcite ) by the schrdinger equation @xmath0with the hamiltonian @xmath1written down in the basis of physical  states @xmath2 , which are the eigenstates of the pauli matrix @xmath3 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 . in the case of a charge qubit",
    "@xcite , these states correspond to a definite number of cooper pairs on the island ( cooper - pair box ) . for a flux qubit @xcite",
    ", they correspond to a definite direction of the current circulating in the ring . in this paper",
    "we assume that the tunnelling amplitude @xmath7 is constant and the bias @xmath8 is a time - dependent function , @xmath9 .",
    "bias  @xmath10 is governed by gate voltage @xmath11 of the gate electrode close to the cooper - pair box in the case of a charge qubit and by magnetic flux  @xmath12 piercing the qubit s loop in the case of a flux qubit .",
    "for definiteness we will consider here flux qubits .",
    "then physical  states  @xmath13 are the states with the definite ( clockwise or counter - clockwise ) direction of the current in the loop .",
    "the above mentioned time - dependent biases are , in fact , potentials for which schrdinger equation can be solved exactly @xcite-@xcite .",
    "thus , the probability calculated using these exact solutions is , for example , probability @xmath14 of clockwise current direction .",
    "we demonstrate that for some special non - periodical forms of potentials the probability of the clockwise current direction at the moment @xmath15 , if at  @xmath16 it was counter - clockwise , becomes a monotonously growing function of time tending to  3/4 .",
    "of course this is a strictly fixed excitation regime but we also study the behavior of the probability under small deviations from this specific regime . it should be noted that when parameters of the model are close enough to their specific values , the probability oscillates but its minimal value may exceed 1/2 .",
    "it is established that such an unusual behavior of the probability is possible even in the presence of a dissipation .",
    "we study not only the time evolution of the probability , but also its time - averaged value .",
    "moreover , we also calculate the probability of finding the system in the excited state and show the possibility of the inverse population in the two - state system even in the presence of a dissipation .",
    "our main result is that using a properly chosen non - periodical time - dependent potentials one can `` freeze '' the qubit state i.e. localize only one of the two possible qubit states for a long time interval .",
    "we note that the probability of the definite current flow ( or equivalently , the definite magnetic moment of the qubit ) is related directly to experimentally measurable values such as the phase shift of the resonant circuit , weakly coupled to the qubit ( as discussed , e.g. , in ref .",
    "moreover , this physical  basis is usually used in quantum computations .",
    "thus , we hope that our results offer new opportunities for controlling the qubit behavior",
    ". additional discussion about controlling the level population can be found in refs . @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in order to construct an exact solution of a differential equation the intertwining operator technique sometimes may be useful .",
    "the idea of the method dates from darboux papers  @xcite and is widely used in the soliton theory @xcite .",
    "its quantum mechanical application ( see e.g.  @xcite ) is related to the fact the one - dimensional stationary schrdinger equation is an ordinary second order differential equation defined by the operator of the potential energy .",
    "the method is based on the possibility to find an operator ( intertwining operator ) that relates solutions of two schrdinger equations with different potentials .",
    "thus , if one knows solutions of the schrdinger equation with a given potential and an intertwining operator is available , there exists a possibility to construct solutions of the same equation with another potential , which can not be completely arbitrary but is an internal characteristic of the method .",
    "there exists also a matrix - differential formulation of the method @xcite which was adapted to quantum mechanical problems in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown how to construct differential - matrix intertwining operators for the system of two differential equations of type .",
    "for that authors @xcite first reduce system   to the one - dimensional stationary dirac equation with an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian where the time plays the role of a space variable and then apply the known procedure developed in @xcite . starting from the simplest case corresponding to @xmath17 ,",
    "a new kind of nontrivial potentials ( biases ) for which schrdinger equation can be solved exactly were found .",
    "here we apply results obtained in  @xcite-@xcite to describe the time evolution of the qubit , time dependence of the qubit localization probability and calculate its time - averaged value .",
    "consider first the case when bias @xmath9 changes in the following way : @xmath18 in ref .",
    "@xcite a detailed analysis of solutions to equation in this case is given . therefore imposing the initial conditions @xmath19 and @xmath20 one finds probability @xmath21 of , for example , the clockwise current direction at the moment @xmath15 if at  @xmath16 it was counter - clockwise . for @xmath22 and @xmath23 it reads @xmath24 , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath25",
    "it is clearly seen from here that @xmath26 is an oscillating function provided @xmath27 . for",
    "@xmath28 the probability becomes equal @xmath29 which is a function monotonically growing from zero at the initial time moment till the value  @xmath30 at @xmath31 or @xmath32 ( see the thick line in fig .",
    "[ fig1a]a ) .",
    "it is important to note that at  @xmath33 close enough to @xmath34 the value of probability @xmath35 exceeds @xmath36 very quickly ( see the thin and dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1a]a ) .    for the time - averaged probability one",
    "gets @xmath37 it follows from eq . that at @xmath38 the averaged probability exhibits a kind of the resonance behavior , i.e. it peaks to its maximal value @xmath39 , ( see the thick line in fig .  [ fig5_a ] )",
    "although for any given @xmath40 @xmath41 is a function asymptotically oscillating with frequency @xmath42 ( see  fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] ) .",
    "more exactly solvable potentials may be obtained with the help of chains of the above simple transformations .",
    "@xcite contains a detailed analysis of the properties of such chains .",
    "the authors show how to generate a large family of new exactly solvable biases for equation  . for a two - fold transformation leading to the bias of the form",
    "@xmath43the clockwise current direction probability is given by @xmath44\\\\ & + & q_{1}\\left [ q_{2}\\sin ^{2}\\theta",
    "\\tau + q_{3}\\sin 2\\theta \\tau \\right ] \\biggr)\\label{p2e2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 the last term in eq .",
    "( [ p2e2 ] ) describes the oscillations with frequency @xmath46 and , hence , under the condition @xmath47 the oscillations in the time - dependence of the probability disappear and it acquires a monotonous character .",
    "therefore , for @xmath48 as given in ( [ e2 ] ) , unlike ( [ e1 ] ) , we can indicate two possibilities for @xmath47 .",
    "so , the probability of the clockwise current direction turns from an oscillating to a monotonous function of time both at @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1b]b ( thick lines ) where we also show an oscillating character of the probability for the parameter @xmath40 close to the above critical values ( thin and dotted lines ) .",
    "time - averaged probability ( [ p2e2 ] ) for @xmath51 of the form ( [ e2 ] ) is given by @xmath52the @xmath40-dependence of @xmath53 is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5_a]b by the thick line .",
    "it has a maximum @xmath54 , at @xmath55 .",
    "let us consider a more complicated case @xcite , @xcite when the bias contains three free parameters @xmath56here @xmath57 is arbitrary but @xmath58 and @xmath59 should satisfy the inequality given in eq . .",
    "we note that in this case @xmath60 is a periodical function with an amplitude related with frequency . expression ( [ e3 ] ) presents a generalization of formula ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , putting @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , in the limit @xmath62 one recovers for @xmath48 result ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "the analytic expression for @xmath63 is rather involved and we will restrict ourselves to a graphical illustration of the clockwise current direction probability at @xmath64 , ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "more graphical illustrations can be found in @xcite .",
    "a quantum system described by a wave function which is a solution of the schrdinger equation with hamiltonian interacts only with an external field described by function  @xmath10 . but in real experiments there is also an interaction of a josephson junction device with an external reservoir which makes impossible describing the system in terms of a wave function since its state is not a pure quantum state anymore and should be described withe the help of a density matrix ( operator in general see e. g @xcite ) formalism .",
    "such kind of systems are particularly important in the context of quantum information processing where environment - induced decoherence is viewed as a fundamental obstacle for constructing a quantum information processors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this section we study the behavior of the qubit with bias @xmath65 as given in eqs .  ,   and taking into account the dephasing and the relaxation processes .",
    "we also study a possibility of the inverse population in the two - level system and investigate how it is influenced by a decoherence .",
    "it is worth noticing that in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors investigate a three - level system , we study a possibility of the inverse population for the two level system itself thus showing the possibility of building a two - level based laser working at a low temperature .",
    "to study the dynamic behaviour of the qubit , we use the master equation for the density matrix . for",
    "the density matrix of the form @xmath66\\]]we solve the equation of motion @xmath67\\]]to obtain the probability @xmath68/2 $ ] .",
    "the effect of the relaxation processes on the system due to a weak coupling to the environment can be phenomenologically described by two parameters , the dephasing ( @xmath69 ) and relaxation ( @xmath70 ) rates ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which we introduce phenomenologically thus obtaining the following system of equations for @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 : @xmath74 in order to verify the possibility of the inverse population in the two - level system we also calculate the probability @xmath75 @xcite of finding the system on the upper level ( excited state ) .    to see the influence of the relaxation on probabilities @xmath35 and @xmath76 exhibiting a monotonous time dependence for @xmath10 in form we choose @xmath77 and plot them in fig . [ fig1_a ] .",
    "we do not show the behavior of @xmath78 and @xmath79 corresponding to @xmath10 as given in since it is similar to that displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1_a ] .",
    "[ fig3_a ] illustrates the evolution of probabilities @xmath80 and @xmath81 when @xmath65 has form with @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "thick lines on these figures correspond to @xmath85 when no relaxation is present in the system .",
    "thin and dotted lines just show the relaxation effect for @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "all values are in units of @xmath7 .",
    "it is clearly seen from here that the inverse population is still possible even if the dissipation is present but during a small time interval @xmath88 only .",
    "time - averaged probabilities @xmath89 and @xmath90 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5_a]a and [ fig5_a]b as functions of dimensionless parameter @xmath40 . here",
    "the thick lines also correspond to the absence of the relaxation and the thin and dotted lines illustrate the relaxation effect for the same values of @xmath91 as in figs .",
    "[ fig1_a ] and [ fig3_a ] .",
    "the dash - dotted curves are drown for @xmath92 .",
    "these results show the possibility of the inverse population only for small enough dissipation ( see the dash - dotted lines ) and for parameter @xmath40 close enough to its critical values when the averaged probabilities pick to their maximal values .",
    "in conclusion , a two - state system subjected to biases of special forms , for which the schrdinger equation is exactly solvable , was considered . for definiteness",
    "we studied the time - evolution of the josephson - junction qubit , but the similar consideration can be applied to other realizations of a two - state system .",
    "we have demonstrated that the dynamics of the josephson - junction qubit displays in these cases several nontrivial features .",
    "varying the form of the time dependent bias , one can change qualitatively the dynamic behavior of the occupation probabilities .",
    "in particular , the amplitude of the oscillating probability , describing the definite current direction in the loop , can be tuned to zero , thus turning the probability to a monotonous function of time .",
    "we calculate the probability of finding the system in the excited state and show that the inverse population in the two - state system is possible even in the presence of a dissipation .",
    "the observation of such an occupation probability behavior may be related to experimentally measurable values , which would make an experimental verification of the theoretical predictions of the present paper .",
