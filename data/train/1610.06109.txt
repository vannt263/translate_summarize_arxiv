    "the deuteron , as the simplest nuclear system , serves the dual role of an `` effective free neutron target ''  @xcite and as a testing ground for sophisticated models of nucleon - nucleon interactions and scattering mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "electron scattering off the deuteron has been used as a means to extract information on its nuclear structure , including the @xmath10-wave ( @xmath11 ) contribution to the ground state wave function  @xcite . on the other hand , experiments that look for modifications of nucleon structure due to nuclear binding",
    "have also used the deuteron as a testbed  @xcite . in all of these cases ,",
    "a thorough and detailed understanding of the scattering mechanism is necessary .    in particular , quasi - elastic scattering off the deuteron has been widely studied  @xcite as an ideal reaction to disentangle various contributions to the reaction mechanism , such as relativistic effects , non - nucleonic components of the deuteron wave function , meson - exchange ( mec ) and isobar ( ic ) currents , and final state interactions ( fsi ) between the outgoing nucleons .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite have focused on higher momentum transfers , where one - nucleon currents are expected to dominate the cross section . because of the continuing ( and growing ) importance of the deuteron as an effective neutron target  @xcite",
    ", a particularly important question is whether there is a kinematic region where the simple picture of the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) works reasonably well , in which the virtual photon is absorbed by only one nucleon inside the deuteron while the other is an unperturbed spectator to the reaction .",
    "alternatively , one wants to test state of the art models of fsi to ascertain if they can yield a reliable description of the reaction mechanism . in this quest ,",
    "polarization degrees of freedom are particularly interesting , yet few experiments exist .    from a practical point of view",
    ", quasi - elastic scattering off a polarized deuteron target ( with or without detection of a final state proton ) is often used as a direct measure of the product of beam and target polarization for spin structure function experiments  @xcite .",
    "this requires that the theoretical asymmetry for this process is well - known , an assumption that should be tested experimentally .    in the following",
    ", we first give a brief overview of the theoretical background for the reaction @xmath4h@xmath12 , followed by an overview of existing data .",
    "section  [ section : experiment ] describes the experimental setup , followed by details of the data analysis and our results .",
    "the final section summarizes our findings .",
    "the deuteron is the simplest stable nucleus , consisting of a proton and neutron bound by only 2.2 mev ( see , for instance , the review by garon and van orden  @xcite ) .",
    "its structure is amenable to detailed and sophisticated microscopic calculations that range from nonrelativistic approaches  @xcite , based on the schrdinger equation , to fully relativistic treatments  @xcite .",
    "comparison of these calculations with experiment allows us to constrain properties of nucleons and of the nucleon - nucleon potential . in turn , given a model for the nucleon - nucleon interaction , form factors and momentum or spatial distributions of the nucleons in deuterium can be obtained  @xcite .",
    "most modern models of the deuteron wave function agree in the basic features of this momentum distribution : at low momenta , it is dominated by the s - wave ( @xmath13 ) where the proton and neutron spin are parallel to the overall deuteron spin , while at momenta beyond 250 - 300 mev/@xmath8 , the contribution from the much smaller d - wave ( @xmath14 ) component ( which overall accounts for about 4 - 6% of the deuteron ground state ) becomes more important . in that kinematic region ,",
    "the expectation value for the nucleon spins is actually opposite to that of the deuteron as a whole .",
    "experimentally , a large body of data on the quasi - elastic deuteron break - up reaction , @xmath15 , has been collected to access information on the nucleon momentum distribution in deuterium ( recent examples can be found in  @xcite ) . a very important question in this context",
    "is how the measured ( missing ) momentum distributions can be connected to the deuteron wave function  @xcite , given their potential distortion by final state interactions ( fsi )  @xcite .    on the other hand , deuteron targets are often used to extract information on the neutron , due to the absence of sufficiently dense free neutron targets . for example , both unpolarized ( see  @xcite and references therein ) and polarized  @xcite structure functions of the neutron are often extracted from measurements on the deuteron . in particular in the latter case , a clear understanding of the spin - dependent momentum distribution of nucleons in deuterium is of great importance , not only for a reliable extraction of neutron spin structure functions but also because the product of target and beam polarization ( which enters the measured asymmetries as a constant factor ) is often extracted using the polarized quasi - elastic reaction @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the @xmath17 reaction ( with and without polarization information ) is often used to access the neutron form factors  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the novel technique of  spectator tagging \" , where a backward - moving proton spectator is detected in coincidence with an inelastically scattered electron , is being used both to access the free neutron structure ( at small spectator momenta  @xcite ) and to study possible modifications of nucleons that are part of a high - momentum correlation  @xcite . in all these cases , it is imperative to understand both the underlying spin - momentum structure of the deuteron as well as the reaction mechanism for electron scattering , including fsi effects .",
    "the present paper focuses on the reaction @xmath16  with a deuteron target polarized along the direction of the incoming electron beam .",
    "the differential cross section for this reaction , @xmath18 is a function of the ( negative of the ) squared four - momentum transferred by the scattered electron , @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 being the four - momenta of the incoming and scattered electron ( in the ultra relativistic limit ) , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath22 is the energy of the incoming electron and @xmath23 is the energy of the scattered electron , while the scattered electron direction is given by the polar angle @xmath24 and the azimuthal angle @xmath25 with respect to the incoming electron beam .",
    "the cross section also depends on the missing momentum @xmath26 of the unobserved ( but inferred ) final state neutron ; we will parametrize this momentum by its magnitude , @xmath27 and its angle @xmath6 relative to the direction of the three - momentum transfer @xmath28 . for polarized beam and target",

    "we adopt here the notation of  @xcite , where the vector ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) and tensor ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) asymmetries are normalized as components of spherical tensors of rank 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "integration over all azimuthal directions @xmath40 of the final state neutron ( around @xmath41 ) leaves only the asymmetries @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( because of parity conservation in the electromagnetic interaction ) .",
    "both asymmetries are functions of the beam energy @xmath22 and @xmath42 as well as @xmath27 and @xmath43 . forming the difference between opposite - sign and equal sign pairs of helicity @xmath35 and target polarization @xmath44 and dividing by the sum",
    ", we arrive at the double - spin asymmetry @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the magnitude of the electron beam polarization and @xmath47 is the average magnitude of the target vector polarization , both along the beam direction .",
    "the target used in the present experiment was vector - polarized up to @xmath48 using dynamical nuclear polarization ( dnp)@xcite , which yields a tensor polarization @xmath49 , according to equal spin temperature ( est ) theory@xcite .",
    "the simplest model for quasi - elastic deuteron breakup , the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) , assumes that the virtual photon is absorbed by a single ( on - shell ) nucleon ( impulse approximation ) and the struck nucleon leaves the nucleus without further interaction ( i.e. , as a plane wave ) . in this model , the measured asymmetry is proportional to the initial polarization of the struck nucleon ( ignoring the small contribution from the tensor asymmetry for the moment ) : @xmath50 here , @xmath51 is the ratio of electric to magnetic sachs form factors of the struck nucleon , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are its polarization components along and transverse to the momentum transfer vector @xmath41 ( in the electron scattering plane ) , @xmath54 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath55\\tan^2\\frac{\\theta_e}{2}\\right)^{-1 } .\\ ] ] is the virtual photon polarization ratio . within this pwia picture ,",
    "measurements of @xmath0 can be used to extract information on the spin and momentum dependence of the nuclear wave function .",
    "one goal of the present experiment is to determine the kinematic region where pwia is a reasonably good approximation .",
    "a more realistic description requires a model that includes the interaction between the spectator and knocked - out nucleon ( fsi ) .",
    "sabine jeschonnek and j.w .",
    "van orden have developed a comprehensive theoretical model  @xcite for this purpose .",
    "the authors model the @xmath16  reaction in various approximations ( including pwia ) as well as with a complete treatment of fsi to learn more about its sensitivity to the initial nuclear state and the reaction mechanism .",
    "they use a relativistic deuteron wave function by solving the gross equation  @xcite .",
    "a current said parameterization  @xcite of the nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitude is used to calculate the interaction of the two nucleons in the final state , up to kinetic energies of about 1.3 gev in the lab frame .",

    "<S> background : :    the deuteron plays a pivotal role in nuclear and hadronic physics , as    both the simplest bound multi - nucleon system and as an `` effective    neutron target '' </S>",
    "<S> . quasi - elastic electron scattering on the deuteron is    a benchmark reaction to test our understanding of deuteron structure    and the properties and interactions of the two nucleons bound in the    deuteron . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    the experimental data presented here can be used to test    state - of - the - art models of the deuteron and the two - nucleon    interaction in the final state after two - body breakup of the deuteron .    focusing on polarization degrees of freedom , we gain information on    spin - momentum correlations in the deuteron ground state ( due to the    d - state admixture ) and on the limits of the impulse approximation ( ia )    picture as it applies to measurements of spin - dependent observables    like spin structure functions for bound nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> information on this    reaction can also be used to reduce systematic uncertainties on the    determination of neutron form factors or deuteron polarization through    quasi - elastic polarized electron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> method : :    we measured the beam - target double spin asymmetry    ( @xmath0 ) for quasi - elastic electron scattering off the    deuteron at several beam energies ( 1.6@xmath11.7 gev , 2.5 gev ,    4.2 gev and 5.6@xmath15.8 gev ) , using the cebaf large    acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) at the thomas jefferson national    accelerator facility . the deuterons were polarized along ( or opposite    to ) the beam direction . the double spin asymmetries were measured as a    function of photon virtuality @xmath2    ( 0.13@xmath13.17 ( gev@xmath3)@xmath4 ) ,    missing momentum ( @xmath5 gev@xmath3 ) ,    and the angle between the ( inferred ) `` spectator '' neutron and the    momentum transfer direction ( @xmath6 ) . results : :    the results are compared with a recent model that includes final state    interactions ( fsi ) using a complete parameterization of    nucleon - nucleon scattering , as well as a simplified model using the    plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) . we find overall good    agreement with both the pwia and fsi expectations at low to medium    missing momenta ( @xmath7 gev/@xmath8 ) ,    including the change of the asymmetry due to the contribution of the    deuteron d - state at higher momenta . at the highest missing momenta </S>",
    "<S> ,    our data clearly agree better with the calculations including fsi . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    final state interactions seem to play a lesser role for polarization    observables in deuteron two - body electro - disintegration than for    absolute cross sections . our data , while limited in statistical power ,    indicate that pwia models work reasonably well to understand the    asymmetries at lower missing momenta . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , this information can be    used to extract the product of beam and target polarization    ( @xmath9 ) from quasi - elastic electron - deuteron    scattering , which is useful for measurements of spin observables in    electron - neutron inelastic scattering . however , at the highest missing    ( neutron ) momenta , fsi effects become important and must be accounted    for . </S>"
