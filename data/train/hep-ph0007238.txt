    "the investigation of heavy quark production in high energy hadron collisions is an important method for studying the quark - gluon structure of hadrons .",
    "realistic estimates of the cross section of heavy quark production as well as their correlations are necessary in order to plan experiments on existing and future accelerators as well as in cosmic ray physics .",
    "the description of hard interactions in hadron collisions within the framework of qcd is possible only with the help of some phenomenology , which reduces the hadron - hadron interaction to the parton - parton one via the formalism of the hadron structure functions .",
    "the cross sections of hard processes in hadron - hadron interactions can be written as the convolutions squared matrix elements of the sub - process calculated within the framework of qcd , with the parton distributions in the colliding hadrons .",
    "the most popular and technically simplest approach is the so - called qcd collinear approximation , or parton model ( pm ) . in this model",
    "all particles involved are assumed to be on mass shell , carrying only longitudinal momenta , and the cross section is averaged over two transverse polarizations of the incident gluons .",
    "the virtualities @xmath2 of the initial partons are taken into account only through their structure functions .",
    "the cross sections of qcd subprocess are calculated usually in the leading order ( lo ) , as well as in the next to leading order ( nlo ) @xcite .",
    "the transverse momenta of the incident partons are neglected in the qcd matrix elements .",
    "this is the direct analogy of the weizsaecker - williams approximation in qed .",
    "it allows to describe quite reasonably the experimental data on the total cross sections and one - particle distributions of produced heavy flavours , however it can not reproduce , say , the azimuthal correlations @xcite of two heavy quarks , as well as the distributions of the total transverse momentum of heavy quarks pairs @xcite , which are determined by the transverse momenta of the incident partons .",
    "there is an attempt to incorporate the transverse momenta of the incident partons by a random shift of these momenta ( @xmath0 kick ) @xcite according to certain exponential distributions .",
    "this allows to describe quantitatively the two - particle correlations @xcite , but it creates the problems in the simultaneous description of one - particle longitudinal and transverse momentum distributions @xcite .    another possibility to incorporate the incident parton transverse momenta is referred to as @xmath0-factorization approach @xcite , or the theory of semihard interactions @xcite . here",
    "the feynman diagrams are calculated taking account of the virtualities and of all possible polarizations of the incident partons . in the small @xmath3 domain",
    "there are no grounds to neglect the transverse momenta of the gluons , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , in comparison with the quark mass and transverse momenta , @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , at very high energies and very high @xmath6 the main contribution to the cross sections comes from the region of @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "the qcd matrix elements of the sub - processes are rather complicated in such an approach .",
    "we have calculated them in the lo . on the other hand",
    ", the multiple emission of soft gluons is included here .",
    "that is why the question arises as to which approach is more constructive .",
    "most of the published papers on @xmath0-factorization have presented no numerical results or presented rather incomplete ones .",
    "old sets of structure functions have been used , and , sometimes , the parton model results obtained with a particular set are compared with @xmath0-factorization results based on another set .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    "we have presented a comparison of results obtained with the help of @xmath0-factorization and the parton model .",
    "the main goal of the paper @xcite was to demonstrate the differences in the qualitative and numerical predictions coming from the matrix elements . to simplify the calculations and to avoid various additional dependences we had used gluon distribution which had only a reasonable qualitative behaviour and a fixed value of @xmath9 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a comparison between the results of the conventional parton model and the @xmath0-factorization approach for the quantities which are measured experimentally .",
    "for this reason we use the realistic gluon distribution grv94 @xcite compatible with the most recent data , see discussion in ref . @xcite .",
    "below we shortly repeat the main formalism of the approaches used , discuss the values of the parameters and present the numerical results on charm and beauty production obtained in the lo ( and qualitatively in nlo ) parton model and in the @xmath0-factorization approach .",
    "the conventional parton model expression for the calculation of heavy quark hadroproduction cross sections has the factorized form @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the structure functions of partons @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the colliding hadrons @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the factorization scale ( i.e. virtualities of incident partons ) and @xmath18 is the cross section of the subprocess which is calculated in perturbative qcd . the latter cross section can be written as a sum of lo and nlo contributions , @xmath19\\biggr ) \\ ; , \\label{shat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the renormalization scale and @xmath21 as well as @xmath22 and @xmath23 depend only on the single variable @xmath24 ( in the factor @xmath25 we assume @xmath26 following @xcite . in the case of different values of @xmath20 and @xmath17 , which is preferable for the description of the experimental data @xcite , eq .",

    "the expression ( 1 ) corresponds to the process shown schematically in fig .",
    "the main contribution to the cross section at small @xmath3 is known to come from gluons , @xmath27 .    usually in the parton model the values @xmath28",
    "are used for the total cross sections and @xmath29 for the one - particle distributions @xcite .",
    "however we calculate the total cross sections of heavy quark production as the integrals over their @xmath1 distrubutions , i.e. with scales  ( 5 ) .",
    "both in the parton model and in the @xmath0-factorization approach we take @xmath30 for the values of short - distance perturbative quark masses @xcite .",
    "another principal problem of the parton model is the collinear approximation .",
    "the transverse momenta of the incident partons , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are assumed to be zero , and their virtualities are accounted for through the structure functions only ; the cross section @xmath18 is assumed to be independent of these virtualities .",
    "naturally , this approximation significantly simplifies the calculations .    the conventional nlo parton model approach with collinear",
    "approximation works quite reasonably for one - particle diustributions and for the total cross sections ; at the same time it is in serious disagreement with the data on heavy quark correlations ( without @xmath0 kick introduction @xcite ) .",
    "in the @xmath0-factorization approach the transverse momenta of the incident gluons in the small-@xmath3 region result from the @xmath33 diffusion in the gluon evolution .",
    "the diffusion is described by the function @xmath34 giving the gluon distribution at a fixed fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the initial hadron , @xmath3 , and of the gluon virtuality , @xmath2 . at very low @xmath3 that is to leading @xmath35 accuracy",

    "although generally @xmath37 is a function of three variables , @xmath3 , @xmath38 and @xmath2 , the transverse momentum dependence is comparatively weak since @xmath39 for small @xmath3 in lla in agreement with @xmath2-dependences of structure function .",
    "note that due to qcd scaling violation the value @xmath34 for the realistic structure functions increases more fast with decreasing of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore at smaller @xmath3 , larger @xmath38 becomes important in the numerical calculations .",
    "the exact expression of the @xmath38 gluon distribution can be obtained as a solution of the evolution equation which , contrary to the parton model case , is nonlinear due to interactions between the partons in the small @xmath3 region .",
    "the calculations @xcite of the @xmath38 gluon distribution in leading order using the bfkl theory @xcite result in differences from our @xmath34 function given by eq .",
    "( 7 ) by only about 10 - 15% .    here",
    "we deal with the matrix element accounting for the gluon virtualities and polarizations .",

    "this shortcoming of eq .",
    "( 11 ) is overcome partly in the case of eq .",

    "the matrix element @xmath88 is calculated in the born approximation of qcd ( see details in @xcite without standard simplifications of the parton model .",
    "eq .  ( 15 ) enables us to calculate straightforwardly all distributions concerning one - particle or pair production .",
    "one - particle calculations as well as correlations between two produced heavy quarks can be easely obtained using , say , the vegas code @xcite .",
    "however there exists a principal problem coming from the infrared region .",
    "since the functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 are unknown at small values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 we use the direct consequence of eq .",

    "the sum of the produced heavy quark momenta is exactly zero here .",

    "( 7 ) ) .    before the numerical comparison it is necessary to note that the nlo parton model actually results only in a normalization factor in the case of one - particle distributions , the shapes of lo and lo+nlo distributions are almost the same ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this means that we can calculate the k - factor @xmath106 say , from the results for the total production cross sections , and restrict ourselves only to lo calculations of @xmath1 , or rapidity distributions multiplying them by the k - factors .",
    "the numerical values of the k - factors depend @xcite on the structure functions used , quark masses , qcd scales and initial energy , the dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath20 being especially important .",
    "this seems to be evident , because the lo contribution is proportional to @xmath107 , whereas the nlo contribution is proportional to @xmath108 .",
    "however the more important dependence at high energies , when small @xmath109 values dominate , comes from the structure of eq .",

    "3 we show their values which were calculated as the ratios of the values of the first term of eq .",

    "the values of heavy quark transverse momenta were fixed at 20  gev / c . in both cases",
    "the values of @xmath121 are rather small at small @xmath120 and @xmath122 at @xmath123 .",
    "now let us compare the numerical results predicted by the parton model and by the @xmath0-factorization approach .",

    "4 . as was mentioned , at comparatively small energies the first term in eq .",
    "( 20 ) dominates and the results of the @xmath0-factorization approach should be close to the lo parton model prediction . actually the first results are even smaller due to the presence of the @xmath116-factor in eq .",
    ". however the @xmath0-factorization approach predicts a stronger energy dependence than the lo parton model both for @xmath124 and @xmath125 production .",
    "this can be explained by additional contributions appearing at very high energies in the @xmath0-factorization approach , see @xcite    the calculated values of one - particle @xmath1 distributions , @xmath126 , in the @xmath0-factorization approach and in the lo parton model are presented in fig .",
    "5 . in all cases",
    "the @xmath0-factorization predicts broader distributions .",
    "the average values of @xmath1 of the produced heavy quarks are rather different in these two approaches , as one can see from table 1 .",

    "20 pt    [ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]     10 pt    it seems to be very natural , because , contrary to the case of the lo parton model , a large @xmath1 of one heavy quark can be compensated not only by the @xmath1 of another heavy quark but also by the initial gluons ( i.e. by hard gluon jet emission ) .",
    "the rapidity distributions of produced heavy quarks presented in fig .",
    "6 show that the main part of the difference between the @xmath0-factorization approach and the lo parton model comes from the central region .",
    "we saw from the previous section that there is only a small difference in our results for the total cross sections and one - particle distributions obtained in the @xmath0-factorization and in the lo parton model .",
    "the predictions of the nlo parton model for these quantities differ from the lo parton model only by a normalization factor of 2 - 2.5 @xcite .",
    "so the difference between our predictions and the nlo parton model should be small .",
    "the calculations of two - particle correlations in different approaches are more informative .",
    "the simplest quantity here is the distribution in the total transverse momentum of the produced heavy quark pair , @xmath129 . in lo ,",
    "evidently , @xmath130 , and if @xmath131 , then @xmath132 is a @xmath133-function of zero .",
    "so the @xmath129 distributions give direct information about the transverse momentum distribution of the incident partons .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath134 , then the distributions in @xmath129 should be narrower in comparison with the one - particle @xmath1 distributions . in this case",
    "the weizsaecker - williams approximation should be valid and one can believe that the parton model reflects the real dynamics of the interaction . in the opposite case , @xmath135 , the large transverse momentum of the produced heavy quark can be compensated not by the other quark , but by a high-@xmath1 gluon .",
    "we have shown in our previous paper @xcite , that about 70 - 80% of the total cross section of high-@xmath1 quark production at high energies originates from such processes , when the heavy quark propagator is close to the mass shell .",
    "we calculate the values of @xmath132 for charm ( a ) and beauty ( b ) production in the @xmath0-factorization approach using the unintegrated gluon distribution eqs .",
    "( 9 ) , ( 10 ) with scale values @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( only for @xmath138  tev ) .",
    "our results for pair production at different initial energies are shown by solid curves in fig .",
    "7 . for the comparison we present by dashed curves the one - particle @xmath1-distributions taken from fig .",
    "5 , obtained in the same @xmath0-factorization approach and with the same @xmath116-factor . as we put @xmath139 = 1 gev@xmath140 in eq .",
    "( 20 ) , we can not distinguish between the initial gluons with @xmath38 equal to , say , 0.1 gev / c and 0.9 gev / c , so our first bin in the @xmath132 distribution has the width 2  gev / c which explains some irregular behaviour of the solid curves at small @xmath1 .",
    "naturally , all the solid and dashed curves are normalized equally at the same energy .    at comparatively small energies",
    ", @xmath141 = 39  gev and even at @xmath141 = 630  gev the distributions @xmath132 are narrower than the one - particle distributions @xmath142 .",
    "this means that the transverse momenta of the produced heavy quarks almost completely compensate each other .",
    "however the situation changes drastically with increasing of the initial energy .",
    "starting from comparatively small @xmath1 , the difference between the curves decreases with energy . at @xmath141 = 14 tev",
    "the distributions are similar both in the cases of @xmath124 and @xmath125 production .",
    "this means that the production mechanism changes in the discussed energy region . at @xmath141 = 14  tev the transverse momentum of the produced heavy quark",
    "is balanced more probably by one or several gluons ( see also @xcite ) , because the contribution with large virtuality in the quark propagator is more suppressed in comparison with the large virtuality in the gluon propagator .",
    "the discussed behaviour depends on the value of the scale @xmath143 in the @xmath116-factor , eq .",
    "the similar calculation at energy @xmath141 = 14 tev with @xmath137 is shown in fig .  7 for pair and single production by dash - dotted and dotted curves , respectively . here",
    "the difference between these two curves is more significant and it becomes larger for lower energies .",
    "the distributions of the produced heavy quark pair as a function of the rapidity gap @xmath144 between quarks are presented in figs .",
    "the difference between the lo pm and the @xmath0-factorization predictions is not large again except for the region of very large @xmath145 .",
    "another interesting correlation is the distribution in the azimuthal angle @xmath146 , which is defined as the opening angle between the two produced heavy quarks , projected onto the plane perpendicular to the beam and defined as the @xmath147-plane . in the lo parton model",
    "the sum of the produced heavy quark momenta projected onto this plane is exactly zero , and the angle between them is always 180@xmath148 . in the case of the nlo parton model",
    "the @xmath146 distribution is non - trivial @xcite , however the predicted distribution ( without including the @xmath0 kick ) is narrower in comparison with the fixed target data @xcite .",
    "the theoretical as well as experimental investigation of such distributions are very important to control our understanding of the considered processes .",
    "the problem is that in the case of one - particle inclusive distributions for heavy quark production in hadron collisions the sum of lo and nlo contributions of the parton model practically coincides @xcite with the lo contribution multiplied by k - factors .",
    "therefore agreement with experimental data can be achieved for too small or too large nlo contribution by fitting one parameter , which can work as a normalization factor ( say , the qcd scale ) .",
    "the deviation in azimuthal correlations from the trivial @xmath149 distribution comes from nlo correction to pm .",
    "however the standard nlo contributions are not large enought for the description of the data and only the comparatively large intrinsic transverse momentum of incoming partons ( @xmath0-kick ) allows to describe @xcite the data .",
    "preliminary results for the azimuthal correlations in the @xmath0-factorization approach were considered in @xcite .",
    "the main difference in the information coming from @xmath132 and @xmath150 distributions is due to the comparatively slow heavy quark .",
    "it gives a negligibly small contribution to the @xmath132 in the first case , whereas in the second one each quark contributes to the distribution @xmath150 practically independently of its momentum , so all corrections coming from quark confinement , hadronization and resonance decay can be important .    as was discussed above , the first contribution in eq .",
    "( 20 ) is the same as the conventional lo parton model in which the angle between the produced heavy quarks is always 180@xmath148 .",
    "however the angle between two heavy hadrons can be slightly different from this value due to a hadronization processes . to take this into account we assume that in this first contribution the probability to find a hadron pair with azimuthal angle @xmath151 is determined by the expression @xmath152 where",
    "@xmath153  gev / c is a transverse momentum in the azimuthal plane coming from the hadronization process .",
    "the other contributions of eq .",
    "( 20 ) result in a more or less broad @xmath146 distribution so we neglect their small modification due to hadronization .",
    "the @xmath0-factorization approach predictions for the azimuthal correlation of heavy quarks produced in @xmath154 collisions are presented in fig .  9 and",
    "one can see that they change drastically when the initial energy increases from fixed target to the collider region .",
    "we have compared the conventional lo parton model ( pm ) and the @xmath0-factorization approach for heavy quark hadroproduction at collider energies using a realistic gluon ( parton ) distribution .",
    "both the transverse momenta and rapidity distributions have been considered , as well as two - particle correlations , such as the distribution over the rapidity gap between two heavy quarks , their azimuthal correlations and distributions of the total transverse momentum of the produced heavy quark pair , @xmath129 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the contribution of the domain with strong @xmath38 ordering ( @xmath155 ) coincides in @xmath0-factorization approach with the lo pm prediction . besides this a very numerically large contribution appears at high energies in @xmath0-factorization approach in the region @xmath156 .",
    "it kinematically relates to the events where the transverse momentum of heavy quark @xmath157 is balanced not by the momentum of antiquark @xmath158 but by the momentum of the nearest gluon .",
    "this configuration is associated with the nlo ( or even nnlo , if both @xmath159 ) corrections in terms of the pm with fixed number of flavours , i.e. without the heavy quarks in the evolution .",
    "indeed , as was mentioned in @xcite , up to 80% of the whole nlo cross section originates from the events where the heavy quark transverse momentum is balanced by the nearest gluon jet .",
    "thus the large `` nlo '' contribution , especially at large @xmath1 , is explained by the fact that the virtuality of the @xmath160-channel ( or @xmath161-channel ) quark becomes small in the region @xmath162 and the singularity of the quark propagator @xmath163 in the `` hard '' qcd matrix element , @xmath164 , reveals itself .",
    "the double logarithmic sudakov - type form factor @xmath116 in the definition of unintegrated parton density ( 10 ) comprises an important part of the virtual loop nlo ( with respect to the pm ) corrections .",
    "thus we demonstrate that @xmath0-factorization approach collects already at the lo the major part of the contributions which play the role of the nlo ( and even nnlo ) corrections to the conventional pm .",
    "therefore we hope that a higher order ( in @xmath9 ) correction to the @xmath0-factorization would be rather small .",
    "another advantage of this approach is that a non - zero transverse momentum of @xmath165-system ( @xmath166 ) is naturally achieved in the @xmath0-factorization .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath167 distribution and compared it with the single quark @xmath1 spectrum . at low energies the typical values of @xmath167 are much lesser than heavy quark @xmath1 in accordance with collinear approximation . however for lhc energy",
    "both spectra become close to each other indicating that the transverse momentum of second heavy quark is relatively small .",
    "the typical value of this momentum ( @xmath168-kick ) depends on the parton structure functions / densities .",
