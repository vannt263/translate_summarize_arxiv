    "m , width=316 ]    a major challenge in biology is to determine how proliferating cells in developing and adult tissues behave _ in vivo_. a powerful technique in solving this problem is clonal analysis , the labelling of a sample of cells within the tissue to enable their fate and that of their progeny to be tracked  @xcite .",
    "this approach gives access to information on proliferation , migration , differentiation ( into other cell types ) , and cell death ( apoptosis ) of the labelled cell population .",
    "the most reliable method of labelling is through genetic modification leading to the expression of a reporter gene in a random sample of cells .",
    "recently it has become possible to activate genetic labelling at a defined time in transgenic mice , enabling the kinetics of labelled cells to be studied with single - cell resolution _ in vivo _  @xcite . from a theoretical perspective , the analysis of clonal fate data presents a challenging `` inverse problem '' in population dynamics : while it is straightforward to predict the time - evolution of a population distribution according to a set of growth rules , the analysis of the inverse problem is more challenging , open to ambiguity and potential misinterpretation .",
    "these principles are exemplified by the mechanism of murine epidermal homeostasis : mammalian epidermis is organised into hair follicles interspersed with _",
    "interfollicular _ epidermis ( ife ) , which consists of layers of specialised cells known as keratinocytes @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : skincrosssection](a ) ) .",
    "proliferating cells are confined to the basal epidermal layer .",
    "as they differentiate into specialised skin cells , the basal cells withdraw from the cycle of cell proliferation and then leave the basal layer , migrating towards the epidermal surface from which they are ultimately shed . to maintain the integrity of the tissue , new cells must be generated to replace those lost through shedding . for many years , it has been thought that interfollicular epidermis is maintained by two distinct progenitor cell populations in the basal layer .",
    "these comprise long - lived stem cells ( s ) with the capacity to self - renew , and their progeny , known as transit - amplifying cells ( ta ) , which go on to differentiate and exit the basal layer after several rounds of cell division @xcite .",
    "stem cells are also found in the hair follicles , but whilst they have the potential to generate epidermis in circumstances such as wounding , they do not appear to contribute to maintaining normal epidermis @xcite .",
    "the prevailing model of interfollicular homeostasis posits that the tissue is organised into regularly sized `` epidermal proliferative units '' or epus , in which a central stem cell supports a surrounding , clonal , population of transit amplifying cells , which in turn generate a column of overlying differentiated cells @xcite .",
    "several experimental approaches have been used to attempt to demonstrate the existence of epus , but conclusive evidence for their existence is lacking .",
    "the epu model predicts that slowly - cycling stem cells should be found in a patterned array in the ife ; cell labelling studies have failed to demonstrate such a pattern @xcite . in chimaeric mice",
    "the epu model predicts that the boundaries of mosaicism in the ife should run along the boundaries of epus ; instead boundaries were found to be highly irregular @xcite .",
    "genetic labelling studies using viral infection or mutation to activate expression of a reporter gene in epidermal cells have demonstrated the existence of long - lived , cohesive clusters of labelled cells in the epidermis , but these clusters do not conform to the predicted size distribution of the epu @xcite .",
    "thus , until recently the means by which homeostasis of ife was achieved has been unclear .",
    "however , by exploiting inducible genetic labelling , recent studies have allowed the fate of a representative sample of progenitor cells and their progeny to tracked _ in vivo _  @xcite .",
    "as well as undermining the basis of the stem / ta cell hypothesis , the range of clone fate data provide the means to infer the true mechanism of epidermal homeostasis . in particular ,",
    "these investigations indicate that the maintenance of ife in the adult system conforms to a remarkably simple birth - death process involving a single progenitor cell compartment .",
    "expanding upon the preliminary theoretical findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , the aim of this paper is to elucidate in full the evidence for , and the properties of , the model of epidermal maintenance , and to describe the potential of the system as a method to explore early signatures of carcinogenic mutations .      to organise our discussion , we begin with an overview of the experimental arrangement , referring to ref .",

    "label was then detected by confocal microscopy , which enables 3d imaging of entire sheets of epidermis .",
    "low - frequency labelling of approximately 1 in 600 basal - layer epidermal cells at a defined time was achieved by using two drugs to mediate a genetic event which resulted in expression of the eyfp gene in a cohort of mice .",
    "this low efficiency labelling ensures that clones are unlikely to merge ( see discussion in section  [ sec : model ] ) . by analysing samples of mice at different time",
    "points it was possible to analyse the fate of labelled clones at single cell resolution _ in vivo _ for times up to one year post - labelling in the epidermis ( see , for example , fig .",

    "circles indicate progenitor cells ( p ) , differentiated cells ( d ) , and suprabasal cells ( sb ) .",
    "note that , because the birth - death process ( [ modelratelaws ] ) is markovian , the lifetime of cells is drawn from a poisson distribution with no strict minimum or maximum lifetime . the statistics of such lineage trees do not change significantly when we account for a latency period between divisions that is much shorter than the mean cell lifetime ( see discussion in section [ sec : stochastic ] ) .",

    "after two weeks , the density of persisting clones was seen to decrease monotonically indicating that the entire cell population within such clones had become differentiated and the clone detached from the basal layer ( shown schematically in figs .",

    "we are therefore lead to abandon , or at least substantially revise , the orthodox stem / ta cell hypothesis and look for a different paradigm for epidermal maintenance .    but , to what extent are the clone fate data amenable to theoretical analysis",

    "[ fig : scaling ] , one may see that , after an initial transient behaviour , the clone size distribution asymptotes in time to the simple scaling form , @xmath11    this striking observation brings with it a number of important consequences : as well as reinforcing the inapplicability of the stem cell / ta cell hypothesis , such behaviour suggests that epidermal maintenance must conform to a simple model of cell division .",
    "the absence of further characteristic time - scales , beyond that of an overall proliferation rate , motivates the consideration of a simple kinetics in which _ only one process dictates the long - time characteristics of clonal evolution_.    moreover , from the scaling observation one can also deduce two additional constraints : firstly , in the long - time limit , the average number of basal layer cells within a _ persisting _ clone _ increases linearly with time _ , viz .",

    "it is helpful to draw on additional experimental observations  @xcite : firstly , immunostaining of clones with a total of two cells ( using the proliferation marker ki67 and , separately , the replication licensing factor cdc6 ) reveals that a single cell division may generate either one proliferating and one non - proliferating daughter through asymmetric division , or two proliferating daughters , or two non - proliferating daughters ( cf .  ) .",
    "secondly , three - dimensional imaging of the epidermis reveals that only @xmath18 of mitotic spindles lie perpendicular to the basal layer indicating that divisions may be considered to be confined to the basal layer , confirming the results of earlier work that indicates a dividing basal cell generates two basal layer cells  @xcite .",
    "this completes our preliminary discussion of the experimental background and phenomenology . in summary ,",
    "the clone fate data reveal a behaviour wholely incompatible with any model based on the concept of long - lived self - renewing stem cells .",
    "the observation of long - time scaling behaviour motivates the consideration of a simple model based on a stochastic non - equilibrium process and is indicative of the labelled cells being both a representative ( i.e. self - sustaining ) population and in steady - state . in the following",
    ", we will develop a theory of epidermal maintenance which encompasses all of these observations .",
    "taken together , the range of clonal fate data and the observation of symmetric and asymmetric division are consistent with a remarkably simple model of epidermal homeostasis involving only one proliferating cell compartment and engaging just three adjustable parameters : the overall cell division rate , @xmath19 ; the proportion of cell divisions that are symmetric , @xmath20 ; and the rate of transfer , @xmath21 , of non - proliferating cells from the basal to the supra - basal layers . to maintain the total proliferating cell population , a constraint imposed by the steady - state assumption , we have used the fact that the division rates associated with the two channels of symmetric cell division must be equal . denoting the proliferating cells as type a , differentiated basal layer cells as type b , and supra - basal layer cells as type c , the model describes the non - equilibrium process , @xmath22 finally , the experimental observation that the total basal layer cell density remains approximately constant over the time course of the experiment leads to the additional constraint that @xmath23 reducing the number of adjustable parameters to just two .    by ignoring processes involving the shedding of cells from the surface of the epidermis ,",
    "the applicability of the model to the consideration of the _ total _ clone size distribution is limited to appropriately short time scales ( up to six weeks post - labelling ) . however ,",
    "if we focus only on the clone size distribution associated with those cells which occupy the basal layer , the model can be applied up to arbitrary times . in this case , the transfer process must be replaced by one in which @xmath24 . in either case , if we treat all instances of cell division and cell transfer as independent stochastic events , a point that we shall revisit later , then the time evolution associated with the process  ( [ modelratelaws ] ) can be cast in the form of a master equation .",

    "@xmath40 , i.e. the continual extinction of clones is compensated by the steady growth of persisting clones such that the average number of proliferating cells remains constant : given enough time , all cells would derive from the same common ancestor , the hallmark of the galton - watson process  .",

    "we are therefore led to conclude that the range of clone fate data for normal adult ife are consistent with a simple ( indeed , the simplest ) non - equilibrium process involving just a single progenitor cell compartment .          at this stage , it is useful to reflect upon the sensitivity of the model to the stochasticity assumption applied to the process of cell division",
    ". clearly , the scaling behaviour ( eq .  [ p_exact_all_cells ] ) depends critically on the statistical independence of successive cell divisions ; each cell division results in symmetric / asymmetric cell fate with relative probabilities as detailed in  ( [ modelratelaws2 ] ) .",

    ", i.e. the time between consecutive cell divisions , were not determined by an independent stochastic process ?",
    "this question may have important ramifications , because the assumption of independent cell division , used in formulating the master equation  ( [ pmastereqn ] ) , introduces a manifestly unphysical behaviour by allowing cells to have arbitrarily short cycle times .",
    "moreover , although a wide distribution of cell cycle - times has been observed for human keratinocytes _ in vitro _  @xcite , it is possible that that keratinocytes _ in vivo _ may divide in _ synchrony _ , giving a cell cycle - time distribution narrowly centered about the mean ( @xmath75 ) . in the following , we shall address both of these points : firstly , we shall show that , up to some potential latency period ( the time delay before a newly - divided cell is able to divide again ) , consecutive cell divisions occur independently as an asychronous , poisson process . secondly , while the data is insufficient to detect a latency period of @xmath0 hours or less between consecutive cell divisions , the data does discriminates against a period lasting longer than @xmath76 hours .    to investigate the degree to which the model is sensitive to the particular cell cycle - time distribution , let us revisit the original model of independent cell division with several variations : firstly , we introduce a latency period of @xmath77 immediately following cell division , in which daughter cells can not divide .",

    "motivated by observations of the minimal cycle - time of ( human ) keratinocytes  @xcite , where a latency period of @xmath78 hours was observed _ in vitro _ , we shall here consider the a range latency periods of up to @xmath79 hours .",
    "secondly , we compare the empirical clone size distributions with a model where all progenitor cells have a cycle - time of exactly @xmath75 , i.e. where cells within each clone divide in perfect synchrony .",
    "finally , we shall investigate a range of intermediate models with different distributions of progenitor cell cycle - time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stochastic](a ) ) .",
    "technically , the resulting clone size distributions may be evaluated through monte carlo simulations of the non - equilibrium process ( [ modelratelaws ] ) with the cycle - time @xmath80 of each proliferating cell selected at random from a gamma distribution of the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the average time to division following the initial latency period @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the `` shape parameter '' of the gamma distribution . in particular",

    "[ fig : fit2data]c ( inset ) , a similar analysis of longer latency periods reveals that for periods of @xmath92 hours , the fit to the data is significantly poorer .",
    "turning next to the predicted basal - layer clone size distributions at late times ( @xmath93 ) ( not shown ) , one may see that all of the proposed distributions asymptotically converge : starting with exactly one cell , then the moment - generating function @xmath94 associated with the a cell population distribution @xmath95 after @xmath96 cell cycles satisfies the recursion relation  @xcite : @xmath97 which asymptotes to the continuous master equation @xmath98 with the relative magnitude of the leading - order correction dropping off as @xmath99 . but",
    "with @xmath100 , this equation is simply the master equation for the moment - generating function associated with the original model , eq .",
    "[ p_exact_acells ] , and so the two models converge . one may therefore conclude that , beyond the first several weeks of the experiment ( @xmath101 ) , the fit to the data is sensitive only to the average cycle time of progenitor cells . with this in mind , we note that for the case of perfectly synchronous cell division , an optimal ( albeit poor ) numerical fit was obtained when @xmath102/week , a figure that compares well with the fit for the independent case .",
    "it appears therefore that _ the predicted average cell division rate ( @xmath19 ) is insensitive to the shape of the cell cycle distribution_.    finally , let us turn to the early time behaviour ( @xmath103 ) , where the predicted distributions are distinct . referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : stochastic](b ) , one may see , at 2 - 4 weeks post - labelling , that relatively large clones ( @xmath104 cells ) appear earlier than expected by a model assuming synchronous division , and that , compared with the same model , a sizeable proportion of small clones ( e.g. , @xmath2 cells ) lingers on for far longer than expected . the same behaviour is observed for the basal layer clone size distribution ( not shown ) .",
    "one may therefore infer that cell division conforms to a model of _ independent _ rather than _ synchronous _ division , allowing for some progenitor cells to divide unusually early , and for others to remain quiescent for an unusually long period of time .    in summary",
    ", we have established that , following division , progenitor cells do not divide for a period that is likely to last up to @xmath0 hours , and not more than @xmath76 hours .",
    "after this latency period , the data is consistent with cells switching to a mode of independent , asynchronous , cell division .",
    "these results shed light on why the simple model of independent cell division presented in section  [ sec : model ] succeeds in producing such a remarkable fit to the data .",
    "although the integrity of the fit of the model to the data provides some confidence in its applicability to the experimental system , its viability as a model of epidermal homeostasis rests on the labelled clone population being representative of all cells in the ife .",
    "already , we have seen that the model , and by inference , the labelled clone population , has the capacity to self - renew .",
    "however , the slow accumulation of eyfp after induction , together with the question of the relative labelling efficiency of the two basal layer cell types , leaves open the question of the very short - time behaviour . accepting the validity of the model , we are now in a position to address this regime .    in doing so , it is particularly useful to refer to the time evolution of clone size as measured by the average number of basal cells in a persisting clone . as expected from the scaling analysis discussed in section  [ sec : scaling ]",
    ", a comparison of the experimental data with that predicted by the proposed cell kinetic model shows a good agreement at long times ( fig .",
    "[ fig : avgsize ] ) .",
    "however , comparison of the data at intermediate time - scales provides significant new insight .",
    "in particular , if we assume _ equal _ labelling efficiency of progenitor and differentiated cells , i.e. that both cell types label in proportion to their steady - state population ( shown as the lower ( red ) curve in the fig .  [",
    "fig : avgsize ] ) , then there is a substantial departure of the predicted curve from the experimental data for times of between two and six weeks .",
    "intriguingly , if we assume that differentiated cells simply do nt label , then the agreement of the data with theory is excellent from two weeks on ! we are therefore lead to conclude that , at least from two weeks , all labelled clones derive from progenitor cells labelled at induction .    with this in mind",
    ", we may now turn to the average clone size as inferred from the data at two days and one week .",
    "here one finds that the model appears to substantially over - estimate the clone size .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : avgsize ] suggests that the average clone size is pinned near unity until beyond the first week post - labelling , i.e. the relative population of single - cell clones is significantly _ larger _ than expected at one week , yet falls dramatically to the theoretical value at two weeks . referring again to the slow accumulation of eyfp , can one explain the over - representation of single - cell clones at one week post - labelling ?",
    "at one week , two - cell clones are observed soon after cell division , and thus express lower concentrations of eyfp compared to single - cell clones . as a result",
    "they may be under - represented . at later times , all labelled clones become visible as eyfp concentration grows , explaining the coincidence of experiment and theory at two weeks .",
    "it follows , of course , that the size distributions at later time points would be unaffected by slow eyfp accumulation",
    ". however , a full explanation of this effect warrants further experimental investigation , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "having elucidated the mechanism of normal skin maintenance , it is interesting to address its potential as a predictive tool in clonal analysis . conceptually",
    ", the action of mutations , drug treatments or other environmental changes to the tissue can effect the non - equilibrium dynamics in a variety of ways : firstly , a revision of cell division rates or `` branching ratios '' ( i.e. symmetric vs. asymmetric ) of _ all _ cells may drive the system towards either a new non - equilibrium steady - state or towards a non - steady state evolution resulting in atrofication or unconstrained growth of the tissue . (",
    "the development of closed non steady - state behaviour in the form of limit cycles seems infeasible in the context of cellular structures . )",
    "secondly , the stochastic revision of cell division rates or branching ratios of _ individual _ cells may lead to cancerous growth or extinction of a sub - population of clones .",
    "the former may be referred to as a `` global perturbation '' of the cell division process while the second can be referred to as `` local '' . in both cases",
    ", one may expect clonal analysis to provide a precise diagnostic tool in accessing cell kinetics . to target our discussion to the current experimental system , in the following we will focus on the action of a local perturbation in the form of a carcinogenic mutation , reserving discussion of a global perturbation , and its ramifications for the study of drug treatment , to a separate publication .",
    "let us then consider the action of a local perturbation involving the activation of a cancer gene in a small number of epidermal cells , which leads to the eventual formation of tumours . in the experimental system , one can envisage the treatment coinciding with label induction , for example by simultaneously activating the eyfp and the cancer gene . in this case , clonal fate data should simply reflect a modified model of cell proliferation leading to the eventual failure of the steady - state model of tissue maintenance .      to quantify the process of cancer onset , we start by establishing the simplest possible changes to process  ( [ modelratelaws ] ) which may be associated with tumour growth .",
    "cancer is widely held to be a disease caused by genetic instability that is thought to arise when a progenitor cell undergoes a series of mutations   @xcite . as a result , cells within the mutant clone prefer to proliferate , on average , over processes leading to terminal differentiation or death . in this investigation",
    "we shall consider a `` simple '' cancer resulting from _ two _ rate - limiting mutations : referring to our proposed labelling experiment , the controlled induction of a cancer - causing mutation during label induction defines the first mutation ; a second , rate - limiting step then occurs with the stochastic occurrence of a second cancer causing mutation .",
    "examples of the first type of mutation may be genes that affect the ability of a cell to respond to genetic changes of the cell , e.g. _ p53 _",
    ", whilst the second mutation may be of a gene that affects clone fate such as the _ ras _ oncogene @xcite .",
    "we may therefore distinguish between `` stage one '' mutated cells , which maintain the steady - state , and `` stage two '' cells , which have the capacity for tumour formation .",
    "the resulting process of cell proliferation is set by three parameters : the overall rate of mutation @xmath105 from a stage one a cell into a cancerous stage two cell ; the division rate @xmath106 of the stage two cells ; and the degree of imbalance @xmath107 between their stochastic rate of proliferation and differentiation . in summary , focusing on the proliferating cell compartment only , and denoting the stage two mutated cells as type a@xmath108 , then the revised cell proliferation model includes the additional non - equilibrium processes @xmath109 the rate @xmath105 may be interpreted as the mean rate with which a stage - one cell acquires an additional mutation necessary to activate a second oncogene .",
    "the mutated cells then give rise , on average , to an exponentially growing cell lineage with growth rate @xmath110 .",
    "this nonequilibrium process was originally addressed by kendall , who predicted the distribution in the number of tumours detected at time @xmath5 after mutation  @xcite .",
    "his focus on tumour statistics may reflect the experimental limitations in clonal analysis at the time : until recently it was not possible to reliably detect clones at all , let alone to count the number of cells per clone .",
    "experimentally , however , the clone size distributions are a more efficient measure of cell kinetics than the tumour number distributions , because they result in a far richer data set , and are accessible within weeks rather than months",
    ". we shall therefore extend kendall s approach to predict the clone size distributions at times far earlier than tumour appearance .          to familiarise ourselves with the modified model ,",
    "consider the evolution of the average clone size with time . focusing on the proliferating cell compartment with @xmath4 type a cells and @xmath111 type a@xmath108 cells in a clone , the relevant mean - field equations are @xmath112 which give the expected shift from linear growth of clones in normal skin to that of exponential growth , @xmath113 . more interestingly , referring to the master equation below",
    ", one may show that the variance in clone size also changes qualitatively : whereas for normal skin the rms variance in clone size grows as @xmath114 , here the variance in the long - time limit is _ finite _ , @xmath115 that is , the relative broadening of the clone size distribution observed in normal skin is halted by the introduction of an exponentially growing cell population .",
    "these observations may already provide a crude method for identifying carcinogenesis through clonal analysis . to do better ,",
    "it becomes necessary to solve for the full size distribution by extending the master equation  ( [ pmastereqn ] ) to include process ( [ processeqn : cancer ] ) .",
    "if we neglect the fate of differentiated cells , then the master equation now describes the evolution of the probability @xmath116 for finding @xmath4 type a cells and @xmath111 type a@xmath108 cells in a clone ,    @xmath117 + r\\lambda\\left[(n+1)p_{n+1,n^*}-n p_{n , n^ * } \\right]+   \\nu\\left[(n+1)p_{n+1,n^*-1}-n p_{n , n^ * } \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad + \\frac{1+\\delta}{2}\\mu\\left[(n^*-1)p_{n , n^*-1 } -   n^ * p_{n , n^ * } \\right]+ \\frac{1-\\delta}{2}\\mu\\left[(n^*+1)p_{n , n^*+1 }   - n^ * p_{n , n^ * } \\right]\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    subject to the experimental boundary condition @xmath118 corresponding to exactly one `` stage one '' cell per clone at @xmath119 . as for the case of normal skin , we shall later be interested in the distribution of persistent clones , defined as , @xmath120 while it is not possible to solve eq .",

    "[ fig : cancer](a ) , the predicted clone size distributions are plotted using the scaling appropriate to the normal ( unperturbed ) system ( cf .",

    ", it is apparent that the scaling @xmath129 fails .",
    "by contrast , from the expression for @xmath130 , it is clear that the size distributions should scale according to the time translation , @xmath131 as confirmed by the results shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cancer](b ) . further consideration of the size distribution exposes several additional features , which may provide further access to the new model parameters : +    * the long - time distribution decays with a rate @xmath132 :    expanding @xmath133 for small @xmath134 gives us the asymptotic form of the universal decay curve . for @xmath135 ,",
    "consistent with the monoclonicity requirement @xmath136 , we find @xmath137 where @xmath138 denotes the gamma function .",
    "this expression allows us to estimate @xmath139 from the rescaled clone size distributions , providing access to the cell division and mutation parameters of the observed cells .    *",
    "the probability of tumour formation is finite :    this is a well - known feature of the simple non - critical birth - death process  ( [ processeqn : cancer ] )  @xcite . referring to the appendix , we find that the probability @xmath140 for any given clone to survive and form a tumour is finite , @xmath141    as a result , the onset of cancer will halt the steady decrease in the density of labelled clones that is a hallmark of the unperturbed system .",
    "these properties , and especially the change in scaling behaviour , allow the onset of early - stage cancer to be identified from observations of clones less than one hundred cells in size .",
    "this may provide a dramatic improvement both in speed and accuracy over current experimental models , which rely on much later observations of tumours ( or hyperplasias ) in order to deduce the cell kinetics at early - stages .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that the range of clone fate data obtained from measurements of murine tail epidermis are consistent with a remarkably simple stochastic model of cell division and differentiation involving just one proliferating cell compartment .",
    "these findings overturn a long - standing paradigm of epidermal fate which places emphasis on a stem cell supported epidermal proliferative unit . as well as providing significant new insight into the mechanism of epidermal homeostasis",
    ", these results suggest the utility of inducible genetic labelleling as a means to resolve the mechanism of cell fate in other tissue types , and as a means to explore quantitatively the effects of drug treatment and mutation .    to conclude",
    ", we note that the analysis above has focused on the dynamics of the clonal population without regard to the spatial characteristics .",
    "indeed , we have implicitly assumed that any model capable of describing the cell size distributions will also succeed in maintaining the near - uniform areal cell density observed in the basal layer . however , it is known that , when augmented by spatial diffusion , a simple galton - watson birth - death process leads to `` cluster '' formation in the two - dimensional system whereupon local cell densities diverge logarithmically  @xcite .",
    "significantly , these divergences can not be regulated through a density - dependent mobility .",
    "understanding how the galton - watson process emerges from a two - dimensional reaction - diffusion type process represents a significant future challenge .    from a practical perspective",
