    "gk per ( 1901 ) is a nearby , historic and spectacular source with a proximity of 470pc @xcite .",
    "the system is one of only two classical novae observed within a planetary nebula to date , offering a chance to study the evolution of both classes of object .",
    "a classical nova event is the result of thermonuclear runaway on the surface of a white dwarf accreting from , typically , a main sequence or a late g or k type star @xcite .",
    "the accreted shell is ejected , at velocities that range from 5x@xmath1 to a few x@xmath2 km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "dwarf novae , which are also exhibited by gk per , are caused by an instability in the accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf star @xcite .",
    "these events accelerate winds to the order of 1 - 6x@xmath2 km s@xmath3 , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is unknown if their ejection is spherically uniform or intrinsically bipolar @xcite .",
    "the common envelope phase is thought to play a major role in the shaping of nova remnants and planetary nebulae alike .",
    "slower nova events are believed to have stronger deviations from spherical symmetry e.g. v1280 sco @xcite when compared to their more energetic counterparts .",
    "the system exhibits a pronounced stream of emission to the ne of the nova shell that is reminiscent of a jet but whose origin has not been settled .",
    "new and archival observations are used to explore the structure and kinematics of the gk per nova shell .",
    "using the aristarchos telescope in greece , new imaging was collected of gk per in september 2014 .",
    "the observations consisted of three narrow band filters ( h@xmath4 , [ n  ii ] and [ o  iii ] ) , with 1800s exposures in each filter .",
    "archival data of @xcite was used and of @xcite .",
    "the imaging was reduced using iraf . to build a fuller view of the remnant and examine the @xmath0jet - like feature ,",
    "manchester echelle spectrometer ( mes ) data were obtained at the san pedro mrtir observatory in mexico .",
    "position - velocity ( p - v ) arrays were generated .",
    "the knot and shell p - v arrays were simulated using the morpho - kinematic modelling code shape @xcite ] .",
    "a full discussion can be found in harvey et al .",
    "( 2016 in prep ) .    _",
    "shell kinematics : _ shape modeling demonstrates that the shell most probably consists of an oblate elongated ring - like equatorial structure ( pa .17ex 120@xmath5 and inc .17ex 54@xmath5 ) with polar over - densities ( fig .",
    "the @xmath0boxy nature of the nebula has long been observed e.g. @xcite . the position angle derived of the old nova shell",
    "fits that of the @xmath0fossil bipolar planetary nebula and the inclination to that of the binary .",
    "we find that the @xmath0polar caps have a systematically lower expansion velocity than the rest of the shell . in the irsa archives the longer wavelength",
    "wise @xcite bands show an abundance of material along these polar regions , potentially having a significant effect on their velocity structure evolution .",
    "_ knot characteristics : _ in a clump - wind interaction their relative velocities must be considered , as it is believed to be the main mechanism in the shaping of the clumps . under more uniform conditions ,",
    "sub- sonic clumps have long tails and their supersonic counterparts display short - stubby tails @xcite .",
    "there are a variety of tail shapes present in gk per suggesting diverse local flow conditions .",
    "the sinusoidal nature of the tails of the knots along the outer edge of the shell are evident in the 1997 hubble images in @xcite .",
    "these wavy tails could be attributed to shaping by the dwarf nova winds , which can thus be found to have a velocity of .17ex 4400 km s@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite gave a velocity estimate of gk per s dwarf nova winds of a few 1000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "_ kinematics of the jet - like feature : _ previously there have been several theories to the origin of this feature , @xcite , first mentioned in @xcite . light - echo contours over iras imagery hinted that it predated the nova shell @xcite .",
    "as our new kinematic data suggests a low velocity ( < 17 km s@xmath3 with a gaussian fhwm ranging from 30 - 40 km s@xmath3 ) we suggest that the feature may be an illuminated part of the waist of the fossil planetary nebula .",
    "this would also explain the curvature and spreading out of the feature .",
    "there is a slight augmentation in brightness of this line in the h@xmath4 and [ o  iii ] 5007   lines corresponding to the location of interaction with pre - existing material seen in radio and x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "one of the main findings from @xcite was there is no significant deceleration of the knots in the sw quadrant of the nova shell , though it had been long believed that the shell had been experiencing a stronger interaction with circumbinary material in this quadrant @xcite .",
    "the barrel with polar over - densities structure presented here , as well as the basic bullet crushing time calculation support their finding .",
    "@xcite indicates the system is moving through less dense material than during the time of the observations of @xcite .",
    "the derived morphology is decidedly oblate , in contrast to the shapes of other nova shells e.g. @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a 2.5d code to investigate remnant shaping for a variety of speed classes and produced rings , blobs and caps as expected but also created oblate remnants .",
    "later @xcite included the effects of a rotating accreted envelope , surprisingly the first panel in their fig .",
    "2 bares quite a resemblance to the morphology derived here .",
    "_ harvey : _ in photoionisation simulations , we conducted using cloudy , a significant initial overabundance of neon was required .",
    "however , the stellar spectrum is not deficient in hydrogen nor enriched in helium , suggesting a nova origin is more likely .",
