    "the interference of the scattering states and its impact on the inter - lead transmission of a quantum billiard is determined by its geometry including the placement of the leads on its boundary.@xcite for the ( semi- ) elliptic geometry considered here , the classical dynamics of the closed billiard is regular , with ballistic particle trajectories divided into so called librators and rotators , which intersect its major axis at the segment between the foci and the segments between the foci and the boundary , respectively.@xcite librators and rotators correspond to quantum eigenmodes@xcite localized about the minor semi - axis ( also called bouncing ball modes ) and along the elliptic boundary ( also called whispering gallery modes ) , respectively.@xcite attaching leads to the straight boundary of the semi - ellipse results in a generalized open mushroom@xcite ( bunimovich ) billiard with multiple stems of infinite length .",
