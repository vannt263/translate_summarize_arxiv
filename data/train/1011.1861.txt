    "recently , two new precise measurements of the proton root mean square ( rms ) radius have been published which deviate by 5 standard deviations .",
    "the first one studying muonic hydrogen resulted after a ten years effort in @xmath0{fm}$ ] @xcite , a factor of about 10 more precise than all previous determinations .",
    "these previous determinations are based on three very different methods : the codata values are derived mostly from electronic hydrogen giving @xmath1{fm}$ ] @xcite , the lamb shift of electronic hydrogen resulting in @xmath2{fm}$ ] @xcite , and electron scattering from hydrogen yielding @xmath3{fm}$ ] @xcite .",
    "these `` electronic '' determinations were recently corroborated by a new precise determination from electron scattering at the mainz microtron mami giving @xmath4{fm}$ ] @xcite . even considering the larger error of the electronic determinations the deviation of @xmath5{fm}$ ] has a significance of five standard deviations .",
    "this unexpected result created quite a stir in the hadron community and asks for explanation .",
    "the following proposals have been ventilated @xcite :    * _ the experimental results are not right . _ + this is highly unlikely .",
    "the electronic experiments are based on well established methods and the agreement of their results can not be accidental .",
    "the muonic experiment represents a very sophisticated study of a group beyond any doubts .",
    "+ however , in a followup paper to ref .  @xcite de  rjula @xcite questions just the correctness of the electron - proton scattering ( ep ) results and a refutation of his conjectures is one of the aims of this paper .",
    "* _ the relevant qed calculations are incorrect . _ + it is true that all determinations with electromagnetic probes require higher order corrections , mostly called `` radiative corrections '' . however , in the case of the electronic determinations the methods used are completely different requiring as different corrections .",
    "this is particularly true for the about half dozen electron scattering experiments performed in different laboratories at very different kinematic conditions .",
    "the agreement of the electronic experiments can not be by chance .",
    "+ the qed calculations , on which the lamb shift determination in muonic hydrogen is based , are very detailed and sophisticated and have been improved again and again over more than four decades .",
    "however , the perturbative expansion requires the knowledge of higher order radial moments of the charge distribution , so called zemach moments @xcite . in a recent paper de  rjula",
    "argued that the solution of the problem might be found in a third zemach moment as large as @xmath6{fm^3}$ ] @xcite . immediately after that publication clot and miller @xcite showed that the proposal of de  rjula is in contradiction with experiment .",
    "nevertheless , de  rjula insisted on his arguments by suggesting that the experimental basis is wrong @xcite .",
    "we shall show on the basis of the most recent , precise experimental results of bernauer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that this is not true and this is the central subject of this paper .",
    "+ it is noteworthy that qed considerations show @xcite that the electron scattering experiments and the atomic hydrogen spectroscopy determine the same radius . *",
    "_ there is , at extremely low energies and at the level of accuracy of the lepton - proton atom experiments , `` physics beyond the standard model '' . _ + after having excluded the previous point there stays the need for an explanation which we will briefly discuss in the conclusions .",
    "however , it is the conviction of the present authors that one has to investigate more ideas within the standard model before one may venture in physics beyond it .",
    "* _ a single - dipole form factor is not adequate to the analysis of precise low - energy data . _ + this is definitely true as we shall show in this paper .",
    "however , the small deviations from the standard one - dipole form @xcite will change the input into the determination of the muonic lamb shift only very mildly , but are at dramatic variance with the proposal of de  rjula @xcite .",
    "before we can turn to the central point , we have to summarise our knowledge about the electric form factor of the proton @xmath7 .",
    "this knowledge started with the key paper of janssens _ et al . _",
    "@xcite using the rosenbluth separation of the electric and magnetic form factors in electron scattering .",
    "they found as the shape of @xmath7 what is called today the standard dipole form @xmath8{(gev / c)^2})]^2 $ ] .",
    "after quite a few further determinations this shape stayed the accepted reference until about the year 2000 .",
    "it was a great surprise that this reference had to be modified after experiments performed at jlab using polarised electrons with polarised targets or by measuring the polarisation transfer to the recoil proton .",
    "they showed a dramatic faster decline than the standard dipole form at large @xmath9 .",
    "several reviews have been published on this topic in the last decade @xcite giving access to the extended literature .    at low momentum transfer squared @xmath9 a particularly precise determination could be reached recently by fitting a large variation of form factor models to the measured differential cross sections directly , i.e.  extending the rosenbluth method @xcite .",
    "this determination showed some structure at scales of the pion cloud and it is this scale which is considered to be particularly essential for the correct determination of the zemach moments .",
    "however , as we will show , the form factor shape is important at all scales due to the features of the fourier transform",
    ". it is needed for the derivation of the charge distribution , indispensable for the calculation of the zemach moments from the measured form factors .",
    "it turns out that the low @xmath9 shape influences the precision of the zemach moments , but the bulk behaviour is essentially insensitive to the specific model chosen .",
    "for large @xmath9 we use the results based on the fit of the pre-2007 data by arrington _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , however , without two photon corrections .",
    "the possible influence of these still unsafe corrections is small in the relevant @xmath9 range and does not change the results in this paper .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the standard dipole form and the shape used in this paper .",
    "this shape consists of the bernauer _",
    "_  results for @xmath10{gev / c}$ ] and of the fits of arrington _ et al . _  for @xmath11{gev / c}$ ] . from the many models of bernauer _",
    "et al . _  which are equivalent within the statistics ,",
    "we have taken the standard dipole times a power series of order 8 to produce the plots and the numerical results . if errors are quoted for the zemach moments given in section [ sec:3 ] the full spread of models is considered with and without readjustment of the arrington _",
    "_  normalisations by as much as 2% . in the future ,",
    "a new global fit including all data is highly desirable , however , as checks show , for the purpose of this letter no better information is needed .     as given by the standard dipole form ( blue curve ) and as given by the assembly of the fits of bernauer _ et al .",

    "form and the green that of arrington _",
    "et al._. the blue curve is again the standard dipole and the magenta curve the toy model of de  rjula . ]    with these form factor parametrisations we can now determine the zemach moments needed for the calculation of the hyperfine splitting and the lamb shift in hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the zemach moments of the nuclear charge distribution come about through the smearing of the coulomb potential with the extended charge distribution and the perturbative expansion of the hydrogen wave functions @xcite .",
    "they are defined by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the convolution of the charge or magnetic distribution for the lamb shift or hyperfine interaction , respectively : @xmath15    since we are at this point concerned with the lamb shift , the proton charge distribution is folded with itself for the calculation of @xmath14 . inserting the fourier transform of the sachs electric form factor @xmath16 for @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , and integrating repeatedly by parts , one finds that the first and the third zemach moment can also be expressed in momentum space @xcite :    @xmath18 \\langle r^3 \\rangle_{(2 ) } \\!\\!\\ ! & = & \\!\\!\\ ! \\frac{48}{\\pi } \\ , \\int_0^{\\infty } \\frac{dq}{q^4 } \\left(g_e^2(q^2)-1+\\frac{q^2}{3}\\langle r^2 \\rangle\\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq:4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these integrals can be evaluated analytically for the dipole form and the monopole form ( see section  [ sec:4 ] ) . for the general form factors of section  [ sec:2 ] we integrate eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) numerically .    for illustration",
    ", we show in fig .",

    "[ fig:1 ] ) , and the standard dipole distribution ( blue curve ) are shown .",
    "the stability of the numerical method used to perform the fourier transform can be seen from the flatness of the curve at larger radii .",
    "the shift of charge from low radii to the tail ( of the light red curve ) can be interpreted as `` pion cloud '' , however , such an interpretation needs a careful qualification @xcite . ]",
    "it is instructive to study the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) and learn where @xmath20 contributes .",
    "the third zemach moment calculated from the assembly of bernauer _ et al .",
    "_  and arrington _ et al .",
    "_  fits is a factor 1.4 larger than the standard dipole reference . for this form about 60% of the integral arise from momentum transfers",
    "@xmath10{gev / c}$ ] , but 75% of the surplus originate in this interval and 50% from @xmath21{gev / c}$ ] .",
    "this demonstrates the particular importance of low @xmath12 electron scattering data for the evaluation of the zemach moments , an observation already rightly emphasized by de  rjula in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < \" , ]",
    "having disproven the proposal of de  rjula by the experiments again , the question arises where else one could find a reconcilement of the two disagreeing radii .",
    "one question is , of course , whether the qed corrections are complete or whether some higher order contributions are not yet sufficiently well studied .",
    "the most recent , comprehensive discussion of these possible deficiencies can be found in the paper by edith borie @xcite .",
    "one might add that it could be necessary that the distorted relativistic wave functions had to be treated in a perturbative sum over multiphoton exchanges .",
    "the convergence of such sums is not proven in qed .",
    "such a calculation may imply the solution of a bethe - salpeter equation and appears hardly possible @xcite .",
    "however , further theoretical studies may finally show that the approximations made so far are adequate .",
    "in this case , one had to go to fancier ideas but still within the framework of the standard model .",
    "we mention the so called `` hadronic corrections '' as the polarisation of the proton or mesonic loops .",
    "we could , for example , assume a further particle - antiparticle fluctuation in the point coulomb field , i.e.  beyond the @xmath22 and @xmath23 pairs included in the calculations of the lamb shift so far .",
    "however , inserting the @xmath24 mass , the lightest hadron known , in the nonrelativistic approximation of pachucki @xcite gives a small contribution of -0.0095mev only , already taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) @xcite .",
    "if we assign the difference of the two determinations of the radius of 0.038fm fully to the energy difference of the @xmath25 point nucleus lamb shift we get a shift of -0.341mev .",
    "the mass of an electrically charged particle - antiparticle pair producing such a lamb shift would be 23mev .",
    "no free particle with this mass is known .",
    "however , quantum mechanics demands fluctuations of quarks - antiquarks also in the coulomb field and one might identify these particles with quarks .",
    "it is not evident that these pairs have to form the asymptotic goldstone boson , the pion , resulting from the breaking of chiral symmetry of qcd , if this is produced dynamically , i.e.  including gluonic components .",
    "one could think of the vacuum in terms of a fock state expansion and consider the contribution to the vacuum polarisation as a sum of terms yielding a low effective mass . inserting the quark charges and assuming @xmath26 one",
    "gets @xmath27{mev / c^2}$ ] .",
    "considering the small energy scales in muonic hydrogen this does not unreasonably compare to the current quark masses @xmath28{mev / c^2}$ ] and @xmath29{mev / c^2}$ ] at the @xmath30{gev}$ ] scale @xcite .",
    "if such qcd loops are present one has to investigate their influence on the qed corrections for the hyperfine splitting of muonic hydrogen as well .",
    "ironically , one could revert the interpretation of the muonic hydrogen experiment if we assume that the qed calculations are sufficiently exact . by inserting the precise radius from the electronic experiments and the safe zemach moments presented in this paper",
    ", one can determine the polarisation in the coulomb field by quark loops or other hadronic , possibly dual , corrections at a very low @xmath9 scale .",
    "this idea needs a thorough theoretical study going beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we thank ulrich jentschura for drawing our attention to the need for a better determination of the zemach moments and stefan scherer and marc vanderhaeghen for discussions on the theoretical aspects .",
