    "nova scorpii 1941 ( v697 sco ) was discovered by margaret mayall on objective prism plates at a photographic magnitude of 10.2 ( mayall 1947 ) .",
    "the spectrum was of a nova at a late stage of development and it was later deduced that at its brightest it had reached @xmath5 ( payne - gaposchkin 1957 ) .",
    "duerbeck ( 1981 ) assigns the light curve to his type a , which has a smooth fast decline without disturbances , and a very fast speed class with @xmath6 @xmath7 15 d. the downes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) catalogue gives a magnitude at minimum of 17 , measured on a j plate .",
    "we find that currently it is about 3 mag fainter than that .",
    "the amplitude of eruption is compatible with the amplitude ",
    "@xmath8 relationship ( e.g. , warner 1995 ) .",
    "our high speed photometry of v697 sco was carried out on the 74-in reflector at the sutherland site of the south african astronomical observatory in 2001 and 2002 .",
    "we used the university of cape town s ccd photometer ( odonoghue 1995 ) in frame transfer mode and without any filter .",
    "photometric calibration was achieved by observation of hot white dwarf standards . the finding chart in the downes et al .",
    "catalogue shows that v697 sco is an isolated star , but crowding among the nearby reference stars restricted observations to conditions of particularly good seeing .",
    "our observational log is given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the light curves of v697 sco are displayed in figure  [ v697scolc ] and show v697 sco to have a complicated waveform , which initially we found difficult to understand .",
    "fourier transforms ( fts ) of these light curves reveal that there is an underlying simplicity : an orbital modulation ( non - sinusoidal ) and a spin period with orbital sidebands , characteristic of an intermediate polar ( ip ) .",
    "the ft of the total data set obtained in june 2002 ( with the means , and linear trends subtracted for each night ) is shown in figure  [ v697scoft ] .",
    "the spectral window shows that , if the data were noise - free , reasonably unambiguous results should be obtained .",
    "a number of window patterns are easily identifiable in the ft , the lowest frequencies of which are at 61.8 @xmath9hz and its first harmonic . despite the presence of 1 d@xmath10 and 6 d@xmath10 aliases ( resulting from the distribution of observations : table  [ tab1 ] ) , the choice of these frequencies is unambiguous if the requirement that they are harmonically related is enforced ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "we identify the lowest frequency as the orbital frequency @xmath11 .",
    "this gives @xmath1 = 4.49 h.    to reveal other frequencies more clearly , we prewhitened the light curves at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , producing the ft shown in the lower panel of figure  [ v697scoft ] .",
    "despite the apparent complexity of the ft , it consists largely of a number of harmonics of the frequency @xmath14 = 83.8 @xmath9hz , their differences with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and the associated window patterns .",
    "this is shown in table  [ tab2 ] where the ` predicted ' frequencies of the components @xmath15 ( adopting the values of @xmath14 and @xmath12 given above ) are compared with observed features in the ft .",
    "the suggested identifications have been marked in figure  [ v697scoft ] .",
    "the modulation at @xmath16 is marked with a query because although there is a spike at the ` predicted ' value , it is only at the level of the noise .",
    "there is no modulation present at the predicted value of @xmath17 .",
    "the frequencies displayed by v697 sco indicate that it is an asynchronous magnetic rotator , i.e. an intermediate polar ( ip ) with an orbital period of 4.49 h and a white dwarf rotation period @xmath18 h.    the unusual appearance of the light curve of v697 sco ( i.e. , compared to other ips ) is due to the presence of several modulations having similar amplitudes , with resulting beats between them .",
    "v697 sco is unique in having @xmath3 at such a large value of @xmath1 : there are two other such ips , ex hya ( e.g. , warner 1995 ) and v1025 cen ( hellier , wynn & buckley 2002 ) , but these are both short period systems . the properties of the three systems are listed in table  [ tab3 ] .    the suite of modulations seen in v697 sco is quite different from the ip hz pup ( nova pup 1963 ) , where the more conventional @xmath19 is observed ( abbott & shafter 1997 ) . the strength of the @xmath20 , and the @xmath21 and @xmath22 components ( which are the @xmath20 amplitude modulated at the orbital frequency ) in v697 sco suggests two - pole accretion onto the primary ; the appearance of @xmath14 and @xmath23 components indicates that the accretion rates are different for the two poles .",
    "almost all ips have @xmath24 , but king & wynn ( 1999 ) have drawn attention to the possibility of spin equilibrium near @xmath3 .",
    "they noticed that in ex hya and v1025 cen the corotation radius @xmath25 ( in a keplerian disc ) of the white dwarf primary is similar to the distance @xmath26 from the centre of the white dwarf to the inner lagrangian point at @xmath27 .",
    "table  [ tab3 ] illustrates this for the three ips : we have adopted 0.6 m@xmath28 for the primaries of ex hya and v1025 cen , but 1.0 m@xmath28 for the primary of v697 sco , which is a nova remnant ( which characteristically have higher masses because of the selection effect arising from more frequent nova eruptions at higher masses ) .",
    "the mass @xmath29 of the secondary is obtained from equation 2.100 of warner ( 1995 ) . in all three stars",
    "@xmath25 is within @xmath30 20% of @xmath26 . in effect",
    ", this implies that the magnetic field of the primary is strong enough to control gas flow from close to @xmath27 , probably producing a ` discless ' system .",
    "nevertheless , part of the transferring gas may be held in a ring or torus , which may eventually be dumped onto the primary , producing short - lived outbursts as seen in ex hya .",
    "some of the gas , however , is centrifuged out along the field lines , resulting in equilibrium @xmath2 at a much larger value .",
    "king & wynn ( 1999 ) conclude that an ip equilibrium with @xmath3 should only be possible for @xmath31 h. the requirement for such equilibrium is that the magnetic moment @xmath32 of the primary should be large enough to produce a field at @xmath27 that can control gas flow , but not strong enough to synchronize the system as a polar .",
    "the latter requires @xmath33 ( king , frank & whitehurst 1991 ; king & wynn 1999 ) where @xmath34 is the rate of mass transfer and @xmath35 is the diameter of the orbit .",
    "it is possible to generalise this condition by using @xmath36(h ) for the secondary ( warner 1996 ; @xmath37 g @xmath38 ) and equation 2.4c of warner ( 1995 ) to derive , for _ non_-synchronization ,    @xmath39    where very weak dependences on @xmath1 and @xmath40 have been supressed .    for ex hya and v1025 cen , for which @xmath41 ( e.g. , warner 1995 ) , we have @xmath42 ; and for v697 sco , where we use @xmath43 appropriate to its longer @xmath1 , @xmath44 .",
    "ips typically have @xmath45 ( warner 1995 ) so the asynchronism of the three stars in table  [ tab3 ] , even v697 sco with its long period , is compatible with theory .",
    "there are two other ips where the first harmonic @xmath20 of the rotation frequency is prominent in the optical region : yy dra ( patterson et al .  1992 ) and rxj0558 + 53 ( allan et al .",
    "these have @xmath1 = 3.96 h and 4.15 h and @xmath2 = 8.8 min and 9.1 min , respectively , and do not show strong @xmath46 sidebands .",
    "v697 sco appears to be in a class of its own .",
    "bw is funded by the university of cape town .",
    "paw is funded partly by strategic funds made available to the university of cape town to bw and partly by the national research foundation .",
