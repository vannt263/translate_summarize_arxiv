    "one of the main objectives for the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) spin program is to quantitatively determine the polarized gluon distribution @xmath11 through longitudinally polarized proton - proton collisions .",

    "mid - rapidity jet production is dominated by quark+gluon and gluon+gluon interactions . therefore hard",
    "scattered gluons can be probed by jet measurements at star in @xmath0 collisions .",

    "the new measured inclusive jet cross section in data is consistent with the next - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd calculations within uncertainties for the @xmath15 region .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath11 remains large for the low @xmath10 region ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "star can begin to probe some of this lower @xmath10 region by measuring asymmetries of final states at different center of mass energies , such as the inclusive jet @xmath5 in 510 gev @xmath0 collisions , and by moving to more forward rapidities .",

    "the latter is determined by pythia 6.426 simulations by studying the difference between the particle level jet cross section and the hard scattering parton jet cross section for each jet @xmath22 bin .",
