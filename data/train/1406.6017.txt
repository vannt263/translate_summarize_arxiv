    "given samples from two distributions , one fundamental and classical question to ask is : how close are the two distributions ?",
    "first , one must specify what it means for two distributions to be close , for which many different measures quantifying the degree of these distributions have been studied in the past .",
    "they are frequently called distance measures , although some of them are not strictly metrics .",
    "the divergence measures play an important role in statistical theory , especially in large theories of estimation and testing .",
    "they have been applied to different areas , such as medical image registration ( @xcite ) , classification and retrieval . in machine learning ,",
    "it is often convenient to view training data as a set of distributions and use divergence measuires to estimate dissimilarity between examples .",
    "this idea has been used in neuroscience , where the neural response pattern of an individual is modeled as a distribution , and divergence meaures is used to compare responses across subjects ( see , e.g @xcite ) .",
    "later many papers have appeared in the literature , where divergence or entropy type measures of information have been used in testing statistical hypotheses . for more examples and other possible applications of divergence measures ,",
    "see the extended technical report ( @xcite ) . for these applications and others , it is crucial to accurately estimate divergences .",
    "+ the class of divergence measures is large ; it includes the rnyi-@xmath0 ( @xcite ) , tsallis-@xmath0 ( @xcite ) , kullback - leibler ( kl ) , hellinger , bhattacharyya , euclidean divergences , etc .",
    "these divergence measures can be related to the csiszr-@xmath1 divergence ( @xcite ) .",
    "the kullback - leibler , hellinger and bhattacharyya are special cases of rnyi-@xmath0 and tsallis-@xmath0 divergences .",
    "but the kullback leibler one is the most popiular of these divergence measures .",
    "1ex    in the nonparametric setting , a number of authors have proposed various estimators which are provably consistent .",
    "krishnamurthy and kandasamy @xcite used an initial plug - in estimator by estimates of the higher order terms in the von mises expansion of the divergence functional . in their frameworks , they proposed tree estimators for rnyi-@xmath0 , tsallis-@xmath0 , and euclidean divergences between two continuous distributions and establised the rates of convergence of these estimators .",
    "1ex the main purpose of this paper is to analyze estimators for divergence measures between two continuous distributions .",
    "our approach is similar on those of krishnamurthy and kandasamy @xcite and is based on plug - in estimation scheme : first , apply a consistent density estimator for the underlying densities , and then plug them into the desired formulas . unlike of their frameworks , we study the uniform bandwidth consistent estimators of these divergences .",
    "we introduce a method to establish consistency of kernel - type estimators divergences between two continuous distributions when the bandwidthh is allowed to range in a small interval which may decrease in length with the sample size .",
    "our results will be immediately applicable to proving uniform bandwidth consistency for nomparametric estimation of divergenge measures .",
    "1ex the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce divergence measures and we construct their nonparametric estimators . in section 3 , we study the unfiform bandwidth consistency of the proposal estimators .",
    "section 4 is devoted on the proofs .",
    "let us begin by standardizing notation and presenting some basic definitions .",
    "we will be concerned with two densities , @xmath2 : @xmath3 $ ] where @xmath4 denotes the dimension .",
    "the divergence measures of interest are rnyi-@xmath0 , tsallis-@xmath0 , kullback - leibler , hellinger , bhattacharyya are defined respectivelly as follows    @xmath5    whenever the integrals in the underlying expressions are meaningful .",
    "these quantities are nonnegative , and they are zero iff @xmath6 almost surely ( @xmath7 ) . these expressions can be used to measure the distance between two distributions .",
    "remark that , the divergences @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively special cases of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we easily check that @xmath12 for the following , we focus only on the estimation of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the kullback - leibler , hellinger and bhattacharyya can be deducing immediately .",
    "+ we will next provide consistent estimator for the following quantity @xmath13 whenever this integral is meaningful . plugging it estimates into the appropriate formula immediately leads to consistent estimator for the divergence measures @xmath11 , @xmath10 .",
    "+ 1ex now , assuming that for all the rest of the paper , the density @xmath14 satisfies : @xmath15 is finite , this implies that @xmath16 is finite .",
    "next , consider @xmath17 a sequence of independent and identically distributed @xmath18-valued random vectors , with cumulative distribution function @xmath19 a density function @xmath20 with respect to lebesgue measure on @xmath18 .",
    "we start by giving some notation and conditions that are needed for the forthcoming sections . to construct our divergence estimators",
    "we define , in a first step , a kernel density estimator for @xmath20 , and then substituting @xmath20 by its estimator in the divergence like functional of @xmath20 . towards this aim ,",
    "we introduce a measurable function @xmath21 fulfilling the following conditions .",
    "1ex    ( * k.1 * ) @xmath21 is of bounded variation on @xmath22 1ex    ( * k.2 * ) @xmath21 is right continuous on @xmath22 1ex    ( * k.3 * ) @xmath23 1ex    ( * k.4 * ) @xmath24 1ex the well known akaike - parzen - rosenblatt ( refer to @xcite and @xcite ) kernel estimator of @xmath20 is defined , for any @xmath25 , by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the smoothing parameter . for notational convenience",
    ", we have chosen the same bandwidth sequence for each margin .",
    "assuming that the density @xmath1 is contiuous , one obtains a strongly consistent estimator @xmath28 of @xmath1 , that is , one has with probability @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "there are also results concerning uniform convergence and convergence rates . for proving such results one usually writes the difference @xmath32 as the sum of a probabilistic term @xmath33 and a deterministic term @xmath34 , the so - called bias .",
    "on can refer to @xcite , among other authors .",
    "1ex in a second step , given @xmath35 , we estimate @xmath16 by setting @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a sequence of positive constant .",
    "thus , using [ divestim ] , the associated divergences @xmath11 and @xmath10 can be estimated by : @xmath39 the appraoch use to define the plug - in estimators is also develloped in @xcite in order to introduce a kernel - type estimators of shannon s entropy .",
    "the uniform bandwidth of these divergences is related on those of the kernel estimator @xmath35 .",
    "1ex the limiting behavior of @xmath35 , for appropriate choices of the bandwidth @xmath40 , has been studied by a large number statisticians over many decades . for good sources of references",
    "to research literature in this area along with statistical applications consult @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , under our assumptions , the condition that @xmath41 together with @xmath42 is necessary and sufficient for the convergence in probability of @xmath43 towards the limit @xmath44 , independently of @xmath31 and the density @xmath20 .",
    "various uniform consistency results involving the estimator @xmath43 have been established .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein . in the next section",
    ", we will use their methods to establish convergence results for the estimates @xmath45 and deduce the convergence results of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we first study the strong consistency of the estimator @xmath45 defined in ( [ divestim ] ) .",
