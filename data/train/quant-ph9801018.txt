    "in the recent years one has found the existence of a generic behaviour for the time evolution of simple quantum systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite averbukh and and perelman have indeed discovered a universal scenario of fractional revivals in the long term evolution of quantum wave packets of bounded system which goes beyond the correspondence principle .",
    "they established this scenario by expanding the bound states energies relevant to the wave packet up to the second order with respect to the mean energy , thus producing a local spectrum linear plus quadratic in one quantum number .",
    "for a well concentrated wave packet at the initial time they defined two time constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 such that the foregoing evolution of the wave packet is predicted as follows : for @xmath5 , the wave packet spreads around the mean trajectory that can be associated with the underlying classical evolution while for @xmath6 the wave packet interferes with itself in such a way that for fractional times @xmath7 the wave packet is divided into @xmath8 fractional wave packets .",
    "if @xmath9 is even , @xmath10 , if not , then @xmath11 .",
    "the specificity of the system and that of the wave packet determines the shape of the fractional wave packets which are supposed to be spread regularly around the mean trajectory . at time @xmath12",
    ", the wave packet is rebuilt either identical or only resemblant to the original one , depending on the importance of the neglected terms higher than quadratic . in some very specific cases ,",
    "the fractional wave packets are clones of the initial one as studied in the most recent paper @xcite and the revival is exact .",
    "this scenario has been validated in the most spectacular manner by several authors for a wave packet in a circular orbit of the hydrogen atom @xcite , see also @xcite and by boris et al .",
    "@xcite for an elliptic orbit .",
    "it has been extended by bluhm and kostelecky @xcite to a very long evolution with the demonstration of superrevivals due to the cubic terms .",
    "the analytical explanation of the effects caused by cubic terms has been found by leichtle et.al .",
    "examples of vibrational wave packets in anharmonic potential of simple molecule were also found since @xcite .",
    "the scenario has been thereafter extended to cases where the energy depends on two quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "a recent synthesis @xcite contains most of the references on this topic while ref .",
    "@xcite has been devoted to the definition of the experimental of wave packets in atomic physics and in molecular physics .",
    "the recurrences studied in ref .",
    "@xcite are all devoted to wave packets and can be mathematically explained in terms of special gausssums .",
    "it is necessary to point out that such sums were earlier extensively used in the physical litterature by berry and golberg @xcite , and berry @xcite who studied the full time evolution of the propagator of a nuclear spin with an hamiltonian of the form @xmath13 .",
    "these authors developed a renormalization theory and discussed the semiclassical limit .",
    "more recently @xcite various talbot effects ( integer , fractional , fractal ) were also discovered with the help of these techniques .",
    "finally berry @xcite has shown the occurrence of fractal dimensions both in space and time during the evolution of a uniform wp in boxes of arbitrary dimensions .",
    "our aim is to consider only angular wave packets for diatomic molecules and also for symmetric rotors and our purpose is to discuss the time evolution of a large enough set of coherent states of the angular momentum .",
    "there is rather extensive literature on the coherent states .",
    "a full bibliography on this subject is found in ref .",
    "but we will focus on the _ intelligent spin states _ described in ref .",
    "@xcite large efforts have been made to build up such wave packets mainly in the context of group theory .",
    "little effort , on the contrary , has been made to understand in detail their time evolution . until the work of @xcite it was not realized that they could evolve according to an universal scenario . for a diatomic molecule or for a symmetric rotor , the spectrum of which are quadratic in quantum number like for the systems discussed in @xcite , the universal scenario is exact and repeats with period @xmath14 .",
    "the main question is whether the fractional wave packets are clones or just resemblant to the initial ones . despite all efforts to concentrate initially the wave packet in the best possible way",
    ", the quantum evolution destroys this concentration ( spatial localization ) according to the rule formulated in @xcite .",
    "we will show in this paper under which conditions the wave packets separate into clones and in which conditions there is a more restricted scenario of partial revivals .",
    "we will also show the existence of new fractional waves with different shapes that we call mutants .",
    "it is crucial to present a simple and physically meaningful picture of a coherent state and to decrease the number of its parameters to the minimum .",
    "one should keep in mind that a coherent wave packet has a classical content larger than the eigenstates of the angular momentum . due to this property",
    ", it is possible to choose in the simplest manner the coherent wave packet as we will show below .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we will study a large set of coherent angular wp which depend only on the angles @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "if we impose one condition of minimum uncertainty these wp are composed of eigenstates of @xmath17 and contain , after a proper choice of the axis of coordinates , only spherical harmonics with magnetic quantum number @xmath18 of the same parity as @xmath19 , these states belong to the family of coherent states called the _ intelligent spin states _ @xcite .",
    "the main body of this article is organized around a particular subset : the exponential wp which are shown to be narrowly related to the coherent states of the harmonic oscillator ( see the appendix ) .",
    "moreover the angular spread of the probability density depends on a single adjustable parameter .",
    "one of the limiting case is a wp derived originally by mostowski @xcite for a diatomic molecule and is called circular . by varying one parameter",
    "one obtains new wp with cylindrical symmetry that we call linear and a large set called elliptic .",
    "each element of this set corresponds to a quantum system like a diatomic molecule or a nucleus in a pure state with a specific preparation giving to it an average angular momentum , an angular distribution and particular spread of the distribution of the angular momentum .    in section [ sec3 ] it will be shown that a wp obtained by atkins and dobson @xcite using schwinger @xcite boson representation of spin 1/2 is a particular circular state almost coincident with the exponential wp .",
    "more generally the boson representation for a spin @xmath20 is also shown to lead to circular states .",
    "the exponential wp provides a closed and compact expression in the angular variables .    in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we will state precisely for our angular wp the scenario of fractional revivals derived in @xcite for the general case .",
    "it is indeed possible to specify the shape of the fractional revivals .",
    "the most spectacular event of cloning found essentially for the infinite square well in one dimension @xcite and for a two dimensional rotor in @xcite is extended here to the most general case of circular wp . for the linear and elliptic wp",
    "the fractional waves are generally different from the initial wp due to the quantum spread .",
    "however for a particular set of times a single clone exists which coincides with the initial wp . in the case of the most general linear wp the fractional waves keep cylindrical symmetry showing isotropy in the spread over the sphere . for the elliptic wp the fractional waves should accomodate two limiting symmetries : the plane symmetry present for circular states and the cylindrical symmetry valid for the linear states .",
    "we call mutants these intermediate fractional waves",
    ".    in section [ sec5 ] we present a numerical calculation showing this evolution for exponential wp .",
    "the cases where cloning occurs is somewhat obvious , however it is interesting to define properly the time windows during which a given system of clones governs the time evolution .",
    "the carpet representation used also elsewhere @xcite is an interesting tool in this respect . a second interesting result of this section lies in the shape of the mutants which can hardly be found from analytical considerations .",
    "it is found that these fractional waves preserve a good angular localization on the sphere .",
    "their shape differs however from that of the initial wp since the generic structure is a well defined crescent - like shape .",
    "finally in section [ sec6 ] , we will construct an angular momentum coherent state of a symmetric rigid rotor according to the rules defined by janssen @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of such a state is studied in section [ sec7 ] .",
    "once the number of parameters is reduced , the time evolution of the coherent state , which is now a three dimensional system with two quantum numbers as in @xcite , presents clones if the ratio of the moments of inertia is rational . in the case when this ratio is not a rational number the fractional wave packets are not clones .",
    "coherent angular wp can be defined as functions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 which fulfill two requirements :    1 .",
    "their angular spread should be under control i.e.  it should be possible to adjust their angular distribution in the easiest manner by changing a few parameters or a simple function . 2 .",
    "a criterion of minimum uncertainty should be obeyed in a manner similar to the conditions satisfied by the coherent states of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "@xmath21 in that direction many attempts have used uncertainty relations derived with the angular variables and the angular momentum operator ( see for example @xcite for a complete reference to these works ) . despite the long list of works devoted to this field there is no detailed evolution of the time evolution of these wp in the literature as said our introduction .",
    "the first attempts in the line of the modern developments has been done in @xcite in which a wp of the rigid rotor in 2 dimensions was shown to clone exactly .",
    "our work will extend these results to three dimensions and will discuss a rather large class of wp .    in the following we will use only uncertainty relations based upon the components of the angular momentum and we will call coherent states all the states which satisfy @xmath22 we assume that this equation holds with the axis of coordinates such that @xmath23 it is a textbook result that a general wp satisfies the inequality ( in units with @xmath24 ) @xmath25 \\rangle|^2 \\;. \\ ] ] this result is derived by considering the norm of the state obtained by application of a special combination of @xmath26 with @xmath27 which involve a real parameter called @xmath0 @xmath28 if the minimum uncertainty condition is realized there exists a value of @xmath0 for which @xmath29 this value of @xmath0 is related to the average values by two formulas @xcite @xmath30 the second of these equations provides a meaningful interpretation of @xmath0 in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . let us now construct states which satisfy eq .",
    "( [ c6 ] ) .",
    "the simplest and most natural possibility is to construct the states @xmath33 as eigenstates of @xmath17 .",
    "this problem was solved long ago @xcite and the solutions were called _",
    "intelligent spin states_. let us briefly sketch a few of their properties and explain why we will consider only a subset of them .",
    "the intelligent spin states are the eigenstates @xmath34 of @xmath17 and of the ( non hermitian ) operator @xmath35 with eigenvalue @xmath36 such that @xmath37 the @xmath38 eigenvectors of ( [ c8a ] ) are discussed extensively in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown by rashid @xcite that there is a one to one correspondance between each eigenvector @xmath39 and a parent state @xmath40 .",
    "therefore instead of @xmath39 it is better to denote a solution of ( [ c8a ] ) as @xmath41 .",

    "( [ c2 ] ) and ( [ c3 ] ) .",
    "these states will be taken into account and will be explicited thereafter .",
    "2 .   the states with @xmath50 .",
    "these particular states were first introduced by bloch and radcliffe @xcite . in a more convenient system of",
    "coordinates they fulfill the simpler equation with @xmath51 @xcite @xmath52 therefore these states will also be considered in our paper and we will call them circular states . 3 .   the states for which the parent value @xmath18 is neither 0 or @xmath53 .",
    "these states do not coincide with the previous ones .",
    "however they are not orthogonal to them .",
    "moreover they require a value of @xmath19 larger or equal to 2 i.e.  a tensor of rank at least equal to two is needed in order to generate them .",
    "we have not studied these states and it is still an open question to build a convenient wp by implying them .    on the contrary the states with @xmath49 can be generated quite naturally starting from a three dimensional gaussian wp as shown in the appendix and require a very simple vector operator .",
    "the states with @xmath49 have a very simple structure in terms of spherical harmonics that is worth to be presented shorly independently on the general solution found in @xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath54 these new spherical harmonics which depend on a continuous real parameter @xmath0 and let us expand them in terms of the usual @xmath55 as @xmath56 the recurrence between the @xmath57 derived from eq .",

    "the wp defined with other values of @xmath0 will be called elliptic in the following .",
    "the justification of this name will be given in the appendix . in section [ sec3 ] many results will be derived for the particular class of wp that will be defined in the following subsection .",
    "most of them can be seen to apply to the general wp ( [ c17 ] ) .      among functions that are possible those which can be expanded in a power series of the variable @xmath75 defined by ( [ c11 ] ) are particularly interesting because they will contain all the partial waves @xmath59 .",
    "we have chosen to concentrate on the exponential coherent wp @xmath76 which possess important properties : they fulfil eq .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) , they have direct connection to coherent states of harmonic oscillator ( see the appendix ) and finally they have a simple geometrical interpretation .",

    "<S> the aim of this article is to present the interference effects which occur during the time evolution of simple angular wave packets ( wp ) which can be associated to a diatomic rigid molecule ( heteronuclear ) or to a quantum rigid body with axial symmetry like a molecule or a nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution is understood entirely within the frame of fractional revivals discovered by averbukh and perelman since the energy spectrum is exactly quadratic . </S>",
    "<S> our objectives are to study how these interference effects differ when there is a change of the initial wp . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a two parameter set of angular momentum coherent states . </S>",
    "<S> from one hand this set emerge quite naturally from the three dimensional coherent states of the harmonic oscillator , from another hand this set is shown to be buit from intelligent spin states . by varying one parameter ( @xmath0 ) a scenario of interferences occur on the sphere at fractional times of the revival time that strongly depends on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath1 the wp , which coincides with a wp found by mostowski , is a superposition of bloch or radcliffe s states and clone exactly in time according to a scenario found for the infinite square well in one dimension and also for the two dimensional rotor . in the context of intelligent spin states it is natural to study also the evolution by changing @xmath0 . for @xmath2 the wp </S>",
    "<S> is called linear and produces in time a set of rings with axial symmetry over the sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the wp for other values of @xmath0 are called elliptic and sets of fractional waves are generated which make a transition between two symm etries . </S>",
    "<S> we call mutants these fractional waves . for specific times </S>",
    "<S> a clone is produced that stands among the mutants . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the change in @xmath0 produces novel change in the quantum spread on the sphere . </S>",
    "<S> we have also constructed simple coherent states for a symmetric rotor which are applicable to molecules and nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> their time evolution also shows a cloning mechanism for the rational ratio of moments of inertia . for irrational values of this ratio , </S>",
    "<S> the scenario of partial revivals completed by bluhm , kostelecky and tudose is valid . </S>"
