    "* ) , proper motions can be plagued by unquantified systematics from the first epoch observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "imperfect astrometry or chemistry limits understanding in a number of sub - fields in astrophysics , including the properties of exoplanet host stars , the formation ( and destruction ) of star clusters , as well as studies of stellar populations and galactic structure , to name a few .",
    "the _ gaia _  mission represents a critical step forward in understanding the galaxy .",
    "_ gaia _  is primarily an astrometric mission , and will provide precise positions , parallaxes and proper motions for more than @xmath3 stars in its final data release in 2022 . while this is a sample size about four orders of magnitude larger than its predecessor _ hipparcos _ , both astrometry and chemistry are required to fully characterize the formation and evolution of the milky way .",
    "_ gaia _  will also provide radial velocities , stellar parameters and chemical abundances for a subset of brighter stars , but these measurements will not be available in the first few data releases . until those abundances are available , astronomers seeking to simultaneously use chemical and dynamical information are reliant on ground - based spectroscopic surveys to complement the available _ gaia _  astrometry .    the first _ gaia",

    "we used the _ gaia _",

    "_ _  is a magnitude - limited stellar spectroscopic survey of the ( nearby ) milky way , principally designed to measure radial velocities for up to @xmath4 stars .",
    "observations were conducted on the 1.2  m uk schmidt telescope at the australian astronomical observatory from 20032013 . a large 5.7  degree field - of - view and robotic fibre positioner made for very efficient observing : spectra for up to 150 targets could be simultaneously acquired . when observations concluded in april 2013 , at least 520,781  useful spectra had been collected of more than 457,588  unique objects .",
    "the target selection for _ _  is based on the @xmath5-band apparent magnitude , @xmath6 , with a weak @xmath7 cut near the disk and bulge @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 band was used for the target selection because it has a good overlap with the wavelength range that _",
    "_  operates in : 84108795   . the resolution and wavelength coverage of _",
    "_  is comparable to the radial velocity spectrometer on board the _ gaia _",
    "space telescope @xcite , and the wavelength range overlaps with one of the key setups used for the ground - based high - resolution _ gaia - eso _  survey @xcite .",
    "the spectral region includes the near infrared triplet lines  strong transitions that are dominated by pressure broadening  which are visible even in metal - poor stars or spectra with very low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios .",
    "atomic transitions of light- , @xmath8- , and fe - peak elements are also present , allowing for detailed chemical abundance studies .    the exposure times for _",
    "_  observations were optimised to obtain radial velocities for as many stars as possible .",
    "detailed chemical abundances were always an important science goal of the survey , but this was a secondary objective .",
    "for this reason the distribution of s / n ratios in _ _  spectra is considerably lower than other stellar spectroscopic surveys where chemical abundances are the primary motivation .",

    "_  survey @xcite  which was specifically constructed for detailed chemical abundance analyses  includes a wavelength range about 2.5 times larger at resolution @xmath12 , and yet the _",
    "_  project still targets for s / n @xmath13 per resolution element .    despite the relatively low resolution and s / n of the spectra compared to other surveys ,",
    "_  data releases have provided excellent radial velocities , stellar atmospheric parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , and detailed chemical abundances @xcite . in this work",
    "we make use of spectra that has been reprocessed for the fifth _ _  data release .",
    "these re - processing steps include : a detailed re - reduction of all the original data frames , with flux variances propagated at every step ; an updated continuum - normalization procedure ; as well as revised determinations of stellar radial velocities and morphological classifications . at the end of this processing for each survey observation we were provided with : rest - frame wavelengths ( without resampling ) , continuum - normalized fluxes , @xmath14 uncertainties in the continuum - normalized flux values , as well as relevant metadata for each observation .",
    "we refer the reader to the official fifth data release paper of the _ _  survey , as presented by @xcite , for more details of this re - processing .",
    "given the high - quality of the normalization performed by the _ _",
    "team , we chose not to re - normalize the spectra .",
    "our tests demonstrated that the procedure outlined in @xcite is sufficient for our analysis procedure .",
    "therefore , there were a limited number of pre - processing steps that we performed before starting our analysis .",
    "first , we calculated inverse variance arrays from the @xmath14 uncertainties provided , and then we re - sampled the flux and inverse variance arrays onto a common rest - wavelength map for all stars . depending on the fibre used and the stellar radial velocity , the range of rest - frame wavelength values varied for each star . given that fluxes were unavailable in the edge pixels for most stars , we excluded pixels outside of the rest wavelength range @xmath15 .",
    "this corresponds to about 30  pixels excluded on either side of the common wavelength array , leaving us with 945  pixels per spectrum for science .",
    "we chose to adopt a data - driven model for this analysis , in contrast to the physics - based models used in _",
    "_  data releases to date .",
    "specifically , we will use an implementation of _ the  cannon _  @xcite .",
    "although this choice complicated the construction of our model ( e.g. , see section [ sec : the - training - set ] ) , a data - driven approach makes use of all available information in the spectrum and lowers the s / n ratio at which systematic effects begin to dominate . in other words , in the low s / n regime , a well - constructed data - driven model will yield more precise _ labels _ ( e.g. , stellar parameters and chemical abundances ) than most physics - driven models .",
    "this is particularly relevant for the low - resolution _",
    "_  data analysed here , because about half of the spectra have s / n @xmath16  pixel@xmath11 .",
    "there are two main analysis steps when using _",
    "the  cannon _ : the _ training _ step and the _ test _ step .",
    "we describe these stages in the context of our model in the following section , and a more thorough introduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "we make the following explicit assumptions about the _ _  spectra and _ the  cannon _ :    * we assume that any fibre- and time - dependent variations in spectral resolution in the _ _  spectra are negligible . *",
    "the _ _  noise variances are approximately correct , independent between pixels , and normally distributed .",
    "* we assume that the normalization procedure employed by the _ _",
    "pipeline is invariant with respect to the labels we seek to measure ( e.g. , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or [ fe / h ] ) , and invariant with respect to the s / n ratio . in other words , we assume that the normalization procedure does not produce different results for high s / n spectra compared to low s / n spectra , nor does the normalization procedure vary non - linearly with respect to stellar parameters ( e.g. , [ fe / h ] ) . *",
    "we assume that stars with similar labels ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and abundances ) have similar spectra . *",
    "a stellar spectrum is a smooth function of the label values for that star , and we assume that the function is smooth enough within a sub - space of the labels ( e.g. , the giant branch or the main - sequence ) that it can be reasonably approximated with a low - order polynomial in label space . * the training set ( section  [ sec : the - training - set ] ) has mean accurate labels for most , but not all stars .",
    "that is to say that we do not assume that _ every _ label in the training is accurate .",
    "we can afford to have a small fraction of inaccurate labels ; a few obvious misclassifications in the training set are affordable .",
    "* we assume that the training data are similar ( in spectra ) to the test data where they overlap in label space , and we assume that the training data spans enough of the label space to capture the variation in the test - set spectra .",
    "given our assumptions , the model we adopt is @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the pseudo - continuum - normalized flux for star @xmath19 at wavelength pixel @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the vectorizing function that takes as input the @xmath22 labels @xmath23 for star @xmath19 and outputs functions of those labels as a vector of length @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a vector of length @xmath26 of parameters influencing the model at wavelength pixel @xmath20 , and @xmath27 is the residual ( noise ) . here",
    "we will only consider vectorizing functions with second - order polynomial expansions ( e.g. , @xmath28 , see sections [ sec : a - simple - model][sec : evolved - star - model ] ) .",
    "the noise values @xmath27 can be considered to be drawn from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the variance in flux @xmath18 and @xmath31 describes the excess variance at the @xmath20-th wavelength pixel .    at the _ training _",
    "step we fix the @xmath22-lists of labels for the @xmath19 training set stars . at each wavelength",
    "pixel @xmath20 , we then find the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath31 by optimizing the penalized likelihood function @xmath32 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2_{jn}+s^2 }      + \\sum_{n=0}^{n-1 } \\ln(\\sigma^2_{jn}+s^2 ) + \\lambda{}\\,q({{\\boldsymbol{\\theta } } } )      \\right ]    \\quad , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 is a regularization parameter which we will heuristically set in later sections , and @xmath34 is a l1 regularizing function that encourages @xmath35 values to take on zero values without breaking convexity @xcite : @xmath36    note that the @xmath37 subscript here is zero - indexed ; the function @xmath34 does not act on the ( first ) @xmath38 coefficient , as this is a ` pivot point ' ( mean flux value ) that we do not expect to diminish with increasing regularization ( e.g. , see equation [ eq : vectorizer - three - label ] ) . in practice",
    "we first fix @xmath39 to make equation [ eq : train ] a convex optimization problem , then we optimize for @xmath25 , before solving for @xmath31 .",
    "the _ test step _ is where we fix the parameters @xmath40 at all wavelength pixels @xmath20 , and optimize the @xmath22-list of labels @xmath41 for the @xmath42-th test set star . here the objective function is : @xmath43 ^ 2}{\\sigma_{jm}^2 + s_j^2 }      \\right ]    \\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after optimizing equation [ eq : test ] for the @xmath42-th star we store the covariance matrix @xmath44 for the labels @xmath41 , which provides us with the formal errors on @xmath41 .",
    "the formal errors are expected to be underestimated , and in section  [ sec : validation ] we judge the veracity of these errors through validation experiments .      we sought to construct a training set of stars across the main - sequence , the sub - giant branch , and the red giant branch .",
    "we required stars with precisely measured effective temperature @xmath1 , surface gravity @xmath2 , and elemental abundances of o , mg , si , ca , al , fe , and ni . this proved to be difficult because the magnitude range of _ _  does not overlap substantially with high - resolution spectroscopic surveys .",
    "the fourth internal data release of the _ gaia - eso _  survey includes giant and main - sequence stars , but only 142 overlap with _ _ , which is too small to be a useful training set for our purposes .",
    "the thirteenth data release from the _ sloan digital sky survey _",
    "@xcite includes labels for _ _  stars on the giant branch and ( uncalibrated values for ) the main - sequence , but our tests indicated that the _ _  main - sequence labels suffered from significant systematic effects . a flat , then ` up - turning ' main - sequence is present , and the metallicity gradient trends in the opposite direction with respect to @xmath2 on the main - sequence ( i.e. , metal - poor stars incorrectly sit above an isochrone in a classical hertzsprung - russell diagram ) . if we consider lower - resolution studies as potential training sets , there are 2,369 stars that overlap with _ _   of which 2,213 have positive s / n ratios in the @xmath45-band ( ` snrg ` ) .",
    "however , the labels are expectedly less precise given the lower resolution , there are no elemental abundances available for the main - sequence stars , and the _ _  lower main - sequence suffers from the same systematic effects seen in the _ _  data .",
    "these constraints forced us to construct a heterogeneous training set . given previous successes in transferring high s / n ratio labels from _ _",
    "@xcite , we chose to use the 1,355 stars in the _ _  _ _   overlap sample for giant star labels in the training set .",
    "of these , about 900 are giants according to _ _ . from this sample",
    "we selected stars to have : determinations in all abundances of interest ( [ x / h ] @xmath46 for o , mg , al , si , ca , fe , and ni ) ; s / n ratios of @xmath47200  pixel@xmath11 in _ _  and @xmath4725  pixel@xmath11 in _ _ ; and we further required that the _ _  did not report any peculiar flags ( ` aspcapflag = 0 ` ) .",
    "these restrictions left us with 536 stars along the giant branch , with metallicities ranging from @xmath48 = -1.79 $ ] to 0.26 .",
    "intermediate tests with globular cluster members showed that the metallicity range of the training set needed to extend at least below @xmath48 \\lesssim -2 $ ] in order for our catalog to be practically useful . without additional metal - poor stars , the lowest metallicity labels reported by our model would be around @xmath48 \\approx -2 $ ] , even for well studied stars with @xmath48 \\sim -4 $ ] ( e.g. , cd  38 - 245 ) .",
    "for this reason we supplemented our sample of _ _  giant stars with 176 known metal - poor giant stars observed by _ _ .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath1 , surface gravity @xmath2 and iron abundance [ fe / h ] labels were adopted from @xcite .",

    "we stress that this decision is made solely to ensure that our overall metallicity scale reflects that of the _ _  survey , down to @xmath48 \\sim -4 $ ] .",
    "indeed , it is likely that for most of these elements , these abundances can not be measured from _",
    "_  spectra for ultra metal - poor stars : the atomic transitions in the _ _  spectral region are simply too weak to influence the spectrum . for this reason ,",
    "our adopted abundances for these very metal - poor stars represent an ` anchor point ' in order to ensure our overall metallicity scale is correct .",
    "we do not recommend the use of our individual abundance labels at @xmath48 \\sim -4 $ ] .",
    "we discuss this issue in more detail in section  [ sec : discussion ] .    assembling a suitable training set for",
    "the main - sequence and sub - giant branch was less trivial .",
    "there are no spectroscopic studies that extend the range of stellar types we are interested in ( e.g. , fgkm - type stars ) , and which also have a large enough sample size that overlaps with _ _ .",
    "moreover , most of the spectroscopic studies we considered also showed a flat lower main - sequence , a systematic consequence of the analysis method adopted ( see * ? ? ? * for discussion on this issue ) .",
    "for these reasons we chose to make use of the _ k2/epic _",
    "catalog @xcite for the training set labels on the main - sequence and sub - giant branch .",
    "the _ k2/epic _",
    "catalog follows from the successful _ kepler _ input catalog @xcite , and provides probabilistic stellar classifications for 138,600 stars in the _ k2 _ fields based on the astrometric , asteroseismic , photometric , and spectroscopic information available for every star .",
    "there are 4,611 stars that overlap between _ k2/epic _  and _ _ .    _",
    "k2/epic _  differs from the _ kepler _ input catalog because _",
    "k2/epic _  does not benefit from having narrow - band @xmath55 photometry to aid dwarf / giant classification . despite this limitation , the labels in the _ k2/epic _  catalog",
    "have already been shown to be accurate and trustworthy @xcite . however ,",
    "when the posteriors are wide ( i.e. , the quoted confidence intervals are large ) due to limited information available , it is possible that a star has been misclassified .",
    "this is most prevalent for sub - giants , where @xcite note that @xmath56% of sub - giants are misclassified as dwarfs .",
    "the probability of misclassification is usually quantified in the uncertainties given for each star ; most dwarfs that have a higher possibility of being sub - giants have large confidence intervals .",
    "therefore , requiring low uncertainties will decrease the total sample size , but in practice it removes most misclassifications .",
    "the situation is far more favourable for dwarfs and giants .",
    "only 14% of giant stars are misclassified as dwarfs , and about 7% of dwarfs are misclassified as giants .",
    "to summarise , the _ k2/epic _",
    "labels with narrow confidence intervals are usually of high fidelity , and given that we have spectra , we can identify any obvious misclassifications .",
    "we sought to have a small overlap between our giant and main - sequence star training sets .",
    "most of our giant training set is encapsulated within @xmath57 , however there is a sparse sampling of stars reaching to @xmath58 .",
    "we required @xmath59 for the _ k2/epic _",
    "main - sequence / sub - giant star training set , allowing for @xmath60  dex of overlap between the two training sets .",
    "we further employed the following quality constraints on the _ k2/epic _  catalog : the upper and lower confidence intervals in @xmath1 must be below 150  k ; the upper and lower confidence intervals in @xmath2 must be less than 0.15  dex ; the s / n of the _ _  spectra must exceed 30  pixel@xmath11 ; and @xmath61  k. unfortunately these strict constraints removed most metal - poor stars , which we later found to cause the test labels to have under - predicted abundances for dwarfs of low metallicity .",
    "for this reason we relaxed ( ignored ) those quality constraints for stars with @xmath48 < -1 $ ] , and included an additional 12 turn - off stars with @xmath62 \\gtrsim -2.1 $ ] from @xcite . after training a model based on main - sequence and giant stars ( section [ sec : the - model ] ) , we found we could identify misclassifications by leave - one - out cross - validation .",
    "however , we chose not to do this because the number of likely misclassifications in the training set was negligible ( @xmath101% ) , and the improvement in main - sequence test set labels was minimal . the distilled sample of the _",
    "_ _k2/epic _  overlap catalog contains 595 stars ( 583 of 4,611 from _ k2/epic _ ) . the full training set for each model ( see next sections )",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : training - set - hrd ] .",
    "we have constructed a justified training set for stars across the main - sequence , sub - giant , and red giant branch . however the lack of overlap between _",
    "_  and other works have resulted in a somewhat peculiar situation .",
    "detailed abundances are available from _ _ for all giant stars in our sample , however only imprecise ( but accurate on expectation ) metallicities are available from _ k2/epic _  for stars on the main - sequence and the sub - giant branch . here",
    "we will construct a simple model for _ all _ stars that only makes use of three labels ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , [ fe / h ] ) , before we outline how we derive abundances for giant branch stars .",
    "the complexity for this model will be quadratic ( @xmath28 is the highest term ) , where the vectorizer @xmath21 expands as , @xmath64_n , t_{{\\rm eff},n}^2 , { \\log g}_n\\,t_{{\\rm eff},n } , { [ \\mathrm{fe / h}]}_n\\,t_{{\\rm eff},n } , { \\log g}_n^2 , { [ \\mathrm{fe / h}]}_n\\,{\\log g}_n , { [ \\mathrm{fe / h}]}_n^2\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    such that @xmath65 produces the design matrix : @xmath66    we used no regularization ( @xmath67 ) for this model . after training the model we treated all 520,781  spectra as test set objects . in the left - hand panel of figure [ fig : test - set - density ]",
    "we show the effective temperature @xmath1 and surface gravity @xmath2 for all spectra .",
    "the main - sequence and red giant branch are clearly visible .",
    "however , the details of stellar evolution are no longer present : the sub - giant branch is not discernible , and there are a number of systematic artefacts ( over - densities ) present in label space .",
    "these artefacts disappear when we require additional quality constraints ( e.g. , no peculiar morphological classifications ) , but the complexity of the hertzsprung - russell diagram is still not present .",
    "thus , we concluded that while this model could be useful for deriving stellar classifications ( e.g. , f2-type giant ) , the labels are too imprecise .",
    "we chose to adopt separate models for the main - sequence and the red giant branch rather than switch to a single model with higher complexity .",
    "this choice allowed us to derive stellar parameters for stars on the main - sequence and sub - giant branch , as well as detailed elemental abundances for red giant branch stars .",
    "however , adopting two separate models introduces the challenge of how to combine the results from two models , or how to assign one star as ` belonging ' to a single model . in section  [ sec : joining - the - models ] we describe how we will use the simple model introduced in this section to discriminate between results from a 3-label main - sequence model in section [ sec : unevolved - star - model ] and a 9-label giant star model in section [ sec : evolved - star - model ] .",
    "we constructed a three - label quadratic model using only main - sequence and sub - giant stars .",
    "in order to set the regularization hyperparameter @xmath33 for this model , we trained 30 models with different regularization strengths , spaced evenly in logarithmic steps between @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "we then performed leave - one - out cross - validation for each model .",
    "specifically , for each star in the training set : we removed the star ; trained the model ; and then inferred labels from the removed star as if it was a test object .",
    "we also performed leave - one - out cross - validation on an unregularized ( @xmath67 ) model , which we will use as the basis for comparison .",
    "for the unregularized case , we calculated the bias and root - mean - square ( rms ) deviation between : the training set labels , and the labels we derived by cross - validation , where one star was removed at a time and the model was re - trained .",
    "we repeated this calculation of bias and rms deviation for all 30 models with different regularization strengths @xmath33 .",
    "we show the _ percentage difference _ in the rms deviation of the labels with respect to the unregularized model in figure [ fig : set - hyperparameters ] .",
    "the upper and lower envelope represent the boundaries across all labels , showing that with increasing regularization , the rms decreased in _ all _ labels .",
    "we found similar improvements in the biases , however these were already minimal in the unregularized case .",
    "the improvement in rms reaches a minimum value near @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , where we achieve rms deviations that are about 10% better than the unregularized case .",
    "based on this improvement we set @xmath70 for this model . at this regularization strength ,",
    "the bias and rms values found by leave - one - out cross validation are , respectively : @xmath72  k and @xmath73  k for @xmath1 , @xmath74  dex and @xmath75  dex for @xmath2 , with @xmath76  dex and @xmath77  dex for [ fe / h ] .",
    "we inferred labels for all 520,781  _ _  spectra using this main - sequence / sub - giant star model ; we made no _ a priori _ decisions as to whether a star was likely a main - sequence / sub - giant star or not .",
    "the results for the entire survey sample are shown in the center panel of figure [ fig : test - set - density ] .",
    "the increased density of solar - type stars is consistent with _ _  observing stars in the local neighbourhood , and the high number of turn - off and main - sequence stars relative to the sub - giant branch",
    "is expected from the relative lifetimes of these evolutionary phases .",
    "an over - density of stars near the base of the giant branch is also present .",
    "this artefact is due to having giant stars in the test set , but not in the training set , and the model is ( poorly ) extrapolating outside the convex hull of the training set .",
    "the red giant branch stars in our training set have stellar parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) and up to 15 elemental abundances from the _",
    "_   @xcite .",
    "a subset of these elements have atomic transitions in the _",
    "_  wavelength region : , , , , , , , and .",
    "however , we excluded [ ti / h ] from our abundance list because of systematics in the _ _ abundances @xcite . therefore we are left with nine labels in our giant star model : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and seven elemental abundances .    similar to sections [ sec : a - simple - model ] and",
    "[ sec : unevolved - star - model ] , we used a quadratic vectorizer for the giant star model . here",
    "the terms are expanded in the same way as equation [ eq : vectorizer - three - label ] , only with nine labels instead of three .",
    "we set the regularization hyperparameter @xmath33 in the same way described in section [ sec : unevolved - star - model ] , using the same 30 trials of @xmath33 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : set - hyperparameters ] , where again the enveloped region represents the minimum and maximum change in rms label deviation with respect to the unregularized case .",
    "at the point of maximum improvement near @xmath78 @xmath79 , the rms in all nine labels has decreased by up to @xmath80% , with all labels showing an improvement @xmath81% , and the mean improvement over all labels is about 10% .",
    "near @xmath82 to @xmath83 , the regularization also produces a sparser matrix of @xmath35 , with @xmath84% more terms ( mostly cross - terms ) having zero - valued entries .",

    "the results from our first model ( section  [ sec : a - simple - model ] )  which includes the main - sequence , sub - giant and red giant branch  shows that a single 3-label quadratic model is too simple for the _ _  spectral range .",
    "the other models have problems , too : unrealistic over - densities in label space show that the main - sequence model and the giant model make very poor extrapolations for stars outside their respective training sets . for these reasons",
    "we were forced to exclude or severely penalize incorrect results from both models .",
    "we emphasize that the choices here are entirely heuristic , and depart from interpreting _",
    "the  cannon _  output labels as the maxima of individual likelihood functions .",
    "each model produces estimates of the labels for a given star , and we use those estimates to produce a unified estimate , but this joint estimate is calculated by disregarding the probabilistic attributes of individual estimates .    before attempting to join the results from the models in sections [",

    "unfortunately these restrictions did not remove all spurious results .",
    "the reason for this can be explained with an example : consider that our giant star model was trained with only giant stars but tested with both giant stars and dwarf stars .",
    "some classes of stars ( e.g. , metal - poor dwarfs ) can project into a region of label space that would suggest it is a giant ( e.g. , a clump star ) .",
    "these objects could have relatively low @xmath93 values ( e.g. , @xmath94 ) and in this example , they would appear as bonafide red clump stars .",
    "these incorrect projections are extrapolation errors in high dimensions that project to ` normal ' parts of the label space in two dimensions . for these reasons we also made use of the simple model in section  [ sec : a - simple - model ] to inform whether we should adopt results from : the red giant branch model ; the main - sequence / sub - giant model ; or a linear combination of the two .    in figure",
    "[ fig : joint - model - differences ] we show the differences in effective temperature @xmath1 and surface gravity @xmath2 between : the main - sequence model ( section  [ sec : unevolved - star - model ] ) and the simple model ( section [ sec : a - simple - model ] ) ; and the differences between the red giant branch model ( section  [ sec : evolved - star - model ] ) and the simple model ( section [ sec : a - simple - model ] ) .",
    "we have scaled the differences in @xmath1 and @xmath2 to make the central peak near @xmath95 to be approximately isotropic by setting @xmath96  k for the main - sequence model , @xmath97  k for the giant model , and @xmath98  dex for both models .",
    "it is important to note that these @xmath99 values do not represent any kind of intrinsic uncertainty or precision : they are merely normalization factors . adopting substantially different scaling factors would produce in clear inconsistencies in our results ( e.g. , sub - giants being misclassified as giants ) .",
    "therefore we chose these factors empirically to make the distributions in figure [ fig : joint - model - differences ] approximately isotropic , and to some extent , comparable . in figure [ fig : joint - model - differences ] the stars within the peak at @xmath95 represent objects where the simple model and the comparison model both report similar labels .",

    "in addition to the cross - validation tests that we have previously described , we have conducted a number of internal and external validation experiments to test the validity of our results . we will begin by describing internal validation tests based on repeat observations , before evaluating our accuracy based on high - resolution literature comparisons .",

    "the relative weighting we have used does not have any formal interpretation as a likelihood or belief ( in any sense ) : it was introduced for practical reasons to identify systematic errors and combine results for multiple models . because the relative weights have no formal interpretation , it is reasonable to consider this method is as _ ad hoc _ as any other approach .",
    "the relative weighting has no warranty to be ( formally ) correct , and therefore may introduce inconsistencies or systematic errors rather than minimizing them .",
    "if we only consider the results from individual models , there are a number of cautionary remarks that stem from the construction of the training set .",
    "the labels for red giant branch stars primarily come from _ _ , where previous successes with _ the  cannon_have demonstrated that _",

    "the metal - poor stars included in this sample are from high - resolution studies @xcite , but it is not known if the stellar parameters are of high fidelity because we have a limited number of quality statistics available . moreover , there is no guarantee that the stellar parameters _ or _ abundances are on the same scale as _ _  ( and good reasons to believe they will not be ; see * ? ? ?",
    "if the metallicities of metal - poor giant stars were on the same scale as the _ _ abundances , there is a larger issue in verifying that the main - sequence metallicities and giant branch metallicities are on the same scale .",
    "the training set for the main - sequence stars includes metallicities from a variety of sources , including _ _ , and the fourth _ _  data release . even on expectation value",
    ", there is no straightforward manner to ensure that the main - sequence model and the red giant branch model produce metallicities on the same scale .",
    "we see no systematic offset in metallicities of dwarf and giant stars that overlap between _",

    ". nevertheless , these are only verification checks based on @xmath136% of the data , and there is currently insufficient data for us to prove both models are on the same abundance scale .",
    "for some of the most metal - poor giant stars in _ _ we _ know _ the abundances are not on the same scale as _ _ , because we were forced to adopt abundances for specific elements when they were unavailable .",
    "although we sought to adopt mean level of galactic chemical enrichment at a given overall metallicity , this is not a representative abundance . even if that is the _",
    "mean _ enrichment at that galactic metallicity , there is no requirement for zero abundance spread .",
    "more fundamentally , we are incorrectly asserting that the element _ must _ be detectable in the photosphere of the star .",
    "there may be no transition that is detectable in that star , even with zero noise , because it is too weak to have any effect on the spectrum . in the most optimistic case , this could be considered to be forcing the model to make use of correlated information between abundances . in a more representative ( pessimistic )",
    "case , we are simply invoking what all abundances should be at low metallicity .",
    "this choice is reflected in the abundances of the test set .",
    "while we do recover trustworthy metallicities for ultra metal - poor ( @xmath48 \\lesssim -4 $ ] ) stars like cd-38  245 , the individual abundances for all extremely metal - poor stars aggregate ( in [ x / fe ] space ; figure  [ fig : gce ] ) at the assumed abundances for the metal - poor stars in our sample .",
    "thus , while the overall metallicities appear reliable , the individual abundances for extremely metal - poor stars in the test set can not be considered trustworthy in any sense . for this reason we have updated the electronic catalog to discard these results as erroneous .    in section  [",
    "sec : method ] we assumed that any fibre- or time - dependent variations in the _ _  spectra are negligible .",
    "this is provably incorrect .",
    "indeed , @xcite note that the effective resolution of _ _",
    "spectra varies from @xmath137 , and that the effective resolution is a function of temperature variations , fibre - to - fibre variations , and thus position on the ccd @xcite .",
    "for this reason we ought to expect our derived stellar parameters or abundances to be correlated either with the fibre number , with the observation date , or both .",
    "if significant , the trend could produce systematically offset stellar abundances solely due to the fibre used .",
    "@xcite conclude that resolution - based effects on the _",
    "_  stellar parameters should be a second - order effect .",
    "we have not seen evidence of these resolution - based correlations in our results , however , we have only performed cursory ( non - exhaustive ) experiments to investigate this issue .",
    "we have shown some potential outcomes when the test set spectra differ significantly from the spectra in the training set .",

    "in other words , unusual spectra can appear as ` clumps ' in regions of parameter space that we could consider as being normal ( e.g. , an over - density of solar - type stars ) .",
    "we addressed this issue for the main - sequence and giant models by using a third model ( section [ sec : a - simple - model ] ) to calculate relative weights .",
    "however , spectra that are unusual from the training set used in the simple model could still project as systematic artefacts in label space .    indeed , there are two known artefacts in our data that are relevant to this discussion .",
    "the first is a small over - density at the base of the giant branch , which is likely a consequence of joining the 9-label and 3-label models .",
    "the second has an astrophysical origin : there are no hot stars ( @xmath138  k ) present in our training set , yet there are many in the _ _  survey .",
    "however , the _ _  pre - processing pipeline ( ` sparv ` ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) performs template matching against grids of cool _ and _ hot stars , and therefore we can use that information to identify hot stars . in figure",
    "[ fig : hot - stars ] we show our derived effective temperatures @xmath1 and surface gravities @xmath2 , where each hexagonal bin is colored by the _ maximum _ temperature reported by ` sparv ` for any star in that bin .",
    "we show the maximum temperature reported by ` sparv ` to demonstrate that hot stars project into a single clump in our label space  near the turn - off  in a region where we may otherwise be deceived into thinking the observed over - density is consistent with expectations from astrophysics .",
    "this line of reasoning extends to spectra with other peculiar characteristics ( e.g. , chromospheric emission ) , and for these reasons we recommend the use of additional metadata to investigate possible artefacts . in our catalog we have included a column containing a boolean flag to indicate whether the labels pass very weak quality constraints .",
    "specifically , we flag results as failing our quality constraints if ` sparv ` indicates a @xmath138  k , or if @xmath139 , or if @xmath140  pixel@xmath11 .",
    "these quality constraints represent the minimum acceptable conditions and should not be taken verbatim : judicious use of the morphological classifications @xcite or additional metadata from the _",
