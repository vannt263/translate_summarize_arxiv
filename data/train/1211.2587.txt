    "the relaxation of an electron beam producing langmuir waves is a fundamental process in space and laboratory plasmas .",
    "as the langmuir waves interact with the fast electrons , and their dynamics are strongly affected by variations in the ambient plasma density and as the heliospheric plasma density is perturbed with different levels of inhomogeneity , the interaction of langmuir waves with non - thermal electrons in turbulent inhomogeneous plasmas is an important topic in astrophysics .    in the solar atmosphere ,",
    "the beam - plasma instability is known to be the cause of type iii radio bursts , with their characteristic rapid frequency drift being a result of the beam propagation through the decreasing density coronal plasma @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the beam relaxation in the inhomogeneous plasma of the solar wind can reproduce the broken power - law in the electron flux spectrum which is observed near the earth for impulsive solar electron events @xcite . in solar flare environments",
    ", it has been shown that the beam relaxation is likely to cause spectral index variations inferred from hard x - ray observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it was recognized already in the context of beam - plasma experiments @xcite that the mere existence of an inhomogeneity in the ambient plasma density was sufficient to produce a redistribution of langmuir wave energy in wavenumber space .",
    "this idea was proposed in order to explain the common observations of electrons with energy above the injected one @xcite in laboratory experiments such as those carried out by @xcite on powerful relativistic beams .",
    "the interaction between the waves and the beam electrons is resonant , which implies that the spectral transfer of wave energy toward lower / higher wavenumbers allows interaction with faster / slower electrons respectively .",
    "various mechanisms may cause this spectral energy transfer , they may involve regular or random density variations , or non - linear interactions between langmuir waves and low - frequency electrostatic compressive modes .",
    "for example , it is known that ion - sound waves can effectively scatter langmuir waves to smaller wavenumbers .",
    "low - frequency electromagnetic modes , such as kinetic alfven waves are compressive and thus their refractive power may also have a substantial effect on the spectral evolution of beam - driven langmuir waves .",
    "numerical simulations of the beam relaxation in a plasma with a constant density gradient were conducted in and the combination of a regular density gradient with allowance for the non - linear coupling to ion sound waves was considered by @xcite , with the result that a very high level of langmuir waves was produced at small wavenumbers . the simulations by found that a fluctuating density could lead to the appearance of accelerated electrons in a collisionally - relaxing electron beam .",
    "@xcite first described the effect of random large scale density inhomogeneities as a diffusive transfer of langmuir wave energy in wavenumber space .",
    "this diffusion equation was used by @xcite to describe the process of elastic scattering off random and time - independent density fluctuations , ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "elastic scattering results only in angular diffusion in wave - number space , and for the case of waves generated by beam electrons with a small angular spread , wave energy is transferred away from the region of excitation in @xmath3-space , which may lead to suppression of the beam - plasma instability . neglecting the effect of wave reabsorption on the electrons ,",
    "the role of the angular diffusion term has been accounted for in the kinetic equations describing the beam - plasma system , by replacing it by a wave damping term @xcite .",
    "however , in general , energy conservation dictates that reabsorption of wave energy by the beam is accompanied by an acceleration of the electrons .",
    "in addition , inelastic scattering results in a change in the absolute value of the langmuir wavenumber , which may produce acceleration in the projected electron distribution .    here",
    ", we consider anew this important topic of beam relaxation in a fluctuating plasma . in section",
    "ii , we derive a general expression for the diffusion coefficient in wavenumber space . in section iii , the wavenumber diffusion is implemented in numerical simulations of the one - dimensional kinetic equations describing the quasilinear evolution of the beam - plasma instability .",
    "we focus on the effect of acceleration of beam electrons in a fluctuating plasma and derive a condition for it to occur . in section iv , we generalize the discussion to 3d and discuss the role of both elastic and inelastic scattering in the acceleration of fast electrons .",

    "the characteristic wavenumber @xmath9 of low - frequency density fluctuations is much smaller than the characteristic wavenumber @xmath3 associated with high - frequency langmuir waves , so we can make the wkb approximation and treat the langmuir waves as quasi - particles .",
    "ambient density fluctuations are associated with a change in the local refractive index experienced by the waves , and in the low frequency limit the langmuir wave dynamics can thus be modeled by hamilton s equations of motion for the quasi - particles , which are given by @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the `` refraction force '' acting on the wave - packets , @xmath13 is the group velocity and @xmath14 is the local plasma frequency @xmath15 .",

    "the main point is that for intense density fluctuations , diffusive broadening of the langmuir wave spectrum becomes large enough for the waves to be mainly reabsorbed by the thermal electrons at @xmath109 .",
    "since the energy density of waves generated is much smaller than the thermal energy of plasma , the effect on the distribution function of thermal particles is negligible .",
    "this is the suppression regime of the beam - plasma instability which has often been discussed in the past , mainly in the context of the role of angular diffusion of wave energy induced by elastic scattering in 3d . as shown here",

    "figure [ fig : parsall ] shows the total beam and tail energies and average tail electron energy for several values of background density and beam density , for both gaussian and power - law density fluctuation spectra .",
    "the distribution of the beam and tail total energies with respect to the parameter @xmath115 is essentially unchanged from figure [ fig : parst ] .",
    "we note that collisional effects remain unimportant for all parameters chosen .",
    "lower beam densities than those shown produce insufficient levels of langmuir waves to cause acceleration , and the parameter @xmath115 is unaffected by changes in local plasma frequency .",
    "the results for power - law fluctuation spectra are similar to those for a gaussian spectrum",
    ". we may therefore expect significant electron acceleration to occur whenever @xmath149 , regardless of the specific spectrum of fluctuations , or the specific values of the other parameters .",
    "using the same methodology developed for the one - dimensional case , we now generalize the diffusive description of langmuir waves to three - dimensions .",

    "the conservation equation for the spectral energy density @xmath151 [ erg ] , is now @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the group velocity . in 3d",
    "the diffusion equation takes the form @xmath154 with the diffusion tensor given by @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the spectrum of the density fluctuations and @xmath157 . in the particular case where density fluctuations are due to waves with a dispersion relation @xmath41 , then @xmath158 and @xmath159 in spherical coordinates with @xmath160 , the general equation for diffusion ( assuming azimuthal symmetry ) is @xmath161 with coefficients given in the appendix below by equation [ eqn : dsph ] .",

    "waves shifted to smaller parallel wavenumbers can be absorbed by beam electrons at larger parallel velocities resulting in acceleration of tail electrons .",
    "a large body of work has been devoted to the role of angular diffusion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with respect to the suppression of the beam - plasma instability , mainly in the context of elastic scattering , i.e. @xmath176 . the electron distribution was assumed to be fixed and the effect of scattering of waves by density fluctuations was modeled solely as wave damping .",
    "however , the energy lost by the waves due to damping is transferred to the electrons leading to electron acceleration .",
    "a full numerical treatment of this 3d diffusion and its acceleration effects is not possible using our 1d quasilinear code , and projecting the 3d case into 1d is uninformative .",
    "however , as seen in the previous section , acceleration of beam electrons in the 1d case occurs when the transport time scale in @xmath3-space is of the order of the the quasilinear time scale , for a wide range of beam , plasma and fluctuation parameters .",
    "angular diffusion convects wave energy in @xmath177 , always toward small @xmath177 and on a time scale given by @xmath178 ( see equation ( [ eqn : diffkpar ] ) ) .",
    "thus we expect angular diffusion to also lead to electron acceleration , confirmed by , for example , the pic simulations of , which include the effect of long wavelength density fluctuations on langmuir waves , and find such an acceleration effect . from our diffusion treatment",
    "we may estimate that this effect will be significant when @xmath179 , whether scattering is elastic or not .",
    "it is also natural to expect that a necessary condition for the electron distribution function to remain fixed , and hence the beam - plasma relaxation to be suppressed , is that @xmath180 otherwise when @xmath179 the effect of electron acceleration studied in this work needs also to be considered in the overall wave - particle energy budget .",
    "in summary , we have considered the effects of the diffusion of langmuir waves in wavenumber space numerically , using a 1-dimensional model .",
    "we found the potential to suppress the beam - plasma instability when the diffusion is sufficiently fast , but also the possibility of a significant acceleration of beam electrons .",
    "the transition from acceleration to suppression is controlled by the ratio of the quasilinear and @xmath3-space diffusive timescales , with the most efficient acceleration occurring when the quasilinear time is close to the timescale for diffusion of langmuir waves in wavenumber space .",
    "this relationship was found to hold for a wide range of beam , plasma , and fluctuation parameters .",
    "in addition , while not presented here , previous work found a similar acceleration effect to occur during the collisional relaxation of a power law beam .",
    "we have also derived the diffusion coefficients for the general case of inelastic scattering in 3-dimensions .",
    "this constitutes an extension of the elastic scattering theory previously discussed in the literature . a coefficient @xmath181 and",
    "a correction to the coefficient @xmath163 proportional to @xmath182 were found . from the diffusion equation and the effects of diffusion in 1d",
    ", we infer that scattering in 3d will be capable of producing electron acceleration , provided the transport time - scale in wave - vector space is of the order of the quasilinear timescale , while the beam plasma relaxation is suppressed only under the condition that the former is much smaller than the later .",
    "the diffusion equation in cartesian coordinates is @xmath183 with coefficient given by @xmath184 where @xmath156 is the spectrum of the density fluctuations",
    ".      in cartesian coordinates , we define one axis to be parallel to the beam direction , labelled as @xmath185 , and have two mutually perpendicular axes labelled , @xmath186 , giving a standard right - handed cartesian coordinate system .",
