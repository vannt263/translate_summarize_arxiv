    "black holes span a wide spectrum of masses : the case for stellar mass holes ( @xmath0 ) in the field [ e.g. , @xcite ] and supermassive holes ( @xmath1 ) in galactic bulges [ e.g. , @xcite ] is extremely strong ; tantalizing evidence suggests middleweight holes ( @xmath2 ) as well @xcite .",
    "stellar mass holes likely form in stellar collapse ; the origins of more massive holes remains mysterious .",
    "such holes could form in the collapse of massive gas accumulations ; they could grow from smaller holes by accretion ; they could grow by capturing stellar mass bodies ; and they could grow by repeatedly merging with holes of comparable mass .",
    "any or indeed all of these mechanisms could contribute to the growth of a given hole .",
    "a black hole s spin may help identify which scenario most strongly impacted its recent history . since spin likely drives outflows and jets in active galaxies , and since jets are presumed to align with black hole spin @xcite , spin may provide an observational probe of a hole s recent growth @xcite .",
    "we examine how spin and mass coevolve in mergers .",
    "binaries will form following galaxy mergers @xcite , and may harden to the point that gravitational - wave ( gw ) emission drives its members together .",
    "eventually , they encounter the last stable orbit ( lso ) , and then plunge and coalesce into a single hole .",
    "our goal is to understand the mass and spin of this remnant hole .    for",
    "nearly equal mass holes , this is extremely difficult : we must model the spacetime dynamics of the transition from a binary to a single black hole , accounting for both holes spins and the radiated energy and angular momentum .",
    "a proper analysis requires mature numerical relativity codes [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "the problem is simpler for small mass ratio , @xmath3 .",
    "this binary is well described as a test particle orbiting a black hole .",
    "gw emission shrinks the small hole s orbit to the lso , whereupon it plunges into the large hole .",
    "neglecting the final emission of radiation after the plunge , the hole evolves simply : its mass adds the small body s energy at the lso , its spin adds the lso angular momentum .    because we only need",
    "global `` conserved '' quantities , this description works surprisingly well even for rather large mass ratio .",
    "post - newtonian analyses @xcite show that finite mass ratio typically changes the lso and its orbital constants by a factor of order @xmath4 .",
    "the error due to the test particle description is @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "we also may safely neglect the energy and angular momentum radiated in the final merger : although its gw luminosity may be large , its duration will be very short .",
    "the mass carried off in this phase , for example , is @xmath7 @xcite . neglecting this radiation incurs an error that is less important than other errors built into our approximations , and rapidly becomes negligible for small mass ratio .",
    "likewise , the small hole s spin can be neglected : since a hole s spin scales with its mass squared , spin will be less important than the orbital angular momentum , provided we exclude @xmath8 .",
    "we set the speed of light @xmath9 and newton s constant @xmath10 to 1 ; a useful conversion factor is @xmath11 .",
    "our binary has masses @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 ; the larger hole has mass @xmath12 and spin @xmath14 ; @xmath15 .",
    "vectors are written in boldface ; hatted quantities have been made dimensionless by dividing out powers of mass  e.g. , @xmath16 .",
    "on reaching the lso , the smaller hole plunges into the large hole , carrying along its orbital constants  energy @xmath17 , angular momentum parallel to the spin @xmath18 , and `` carter constant '' @xmath19 .",
    "the carter constant separates the equations of motion in a hamilton - jacobi description of black hole orbits [ e.g. , @xcite ( mtw ) ] .",
    "it is essentially just the `` rest '' of the orbit s angular momentum : to very high accuracy @xcite , one can describe the binary as having an angular momentum @xmath20 .",
    "we treat @xmath19 as @xmath21 , angular momentum projected into the equatorial plane ( perpendicular to the spin ) .",
    "this treatment resonates with the theory of orbits in axisymmetric potentials : @xmath19 is a relativistic analog of the `` 3rd integral '' @xmath22 [ cf .",
    "@xcite ] . treating @xmath19 as @xmath21 is exact for orbits of non - spinning holes ; for maximal spin , the error is less than a few percent @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 includes the rest mass of the orbiting body : bound orbits have @xmath23 , unbound orbits @xmath24 .",
    "the lso is a one - parameter set of orbits : each orbit has radius @xmath25 and constants @xmath26 determined by the inclination angle @xmath27 , defined as @xmath28 this angle is very useful : detailed studies @xcite show it remains practically constant during inspiral , so a distribution @xmath29 describing an ensemble of binaries at formation likewise describes that ensemble at plunge . to find the constants for circular orbits at plunge , solve @xmath30",
    "prime denotes @xmath31 , and the `` potential '' @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 ^ 2- \\delta(r)\\left[r^2 + ( l_z - ae)^2 + q\\right]\\ ; , \\label{eq : radpotential}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 .",
    "this potential describes the orbit s radial motion ; see mtw , chap .",
    "the lso is bounded by prograde ( @xmath35 ) and retrograde ( @xmath36 ) equatorial orbits , with constants @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 , and @xmath39\\;,\\\\ z_2 & = & \\left[3 { \\hat a}^2 + z_1 ^ 2\\right]^{1/2}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the upper sign is for prograde orbits , the lower for retrograde .",
    "we now drop the `` lso '' subscript , since we always refer to these quantities at the lso .    using the bounding cases as initial guesses , it is straightforward to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : reqns_circ ] ) using newton s method @xcite for the constants .",
    "the results are surprisingly well fit by a simple rule : letting @xmath40 stand for @xmath25 , @xmath17 , or @xmath41 , @xmath42 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi_lso ] ) for @xmath41 , one builds @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "these fits are extremely good for small spin , and induce errors of about @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "we should also consider eccentricity @xmath47 .",
    "major mergers are well described by a circular lso ( eccentricity rapidly bleeds away in the formation of a tight binary and by the inspiral ) , but minor mergers will have significant eccentricity .",
    "we find that a black hole growth history barely changes when eccentricity is taken into account : almost identical growth histories are obtained with @xmath48 and with @xmath49 .",
    "we will confine our discussion to circular orbits .",
    "it is now simple to compute a remnant s properties . before merger , the large hole has mass @xmath12 and spin @xmath50 along the @xmath51 axis .",
    "after merger , the remnant has mass and spin @xmath52\\ ; , \\label{eq : mnew}\\\\ s'_z & = & m^2[{\\hat a } + q { \\hat l}_z({\\hat a},\\mu)]\\ ; , \\label{eq : sznew}\\\\ s'_\\perp & = & q m^2 { \\hat l}_\\perp({\\hat a},\\mu)\\;. \\label{eq : sperpnew}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the remnant hole is inclined at an angle @xmath53 relative to the original hole , and has spin @xmath54 : @xmath55",
    "we now examine the remnant s properties following a single merger , choosing @xmath56 and computing @xmath26 as functions of the larger hole s spin @xmath57 and the inclination cosine @xmath58 .",
    "we do not yet use the approximation ( [ eq : xi_lso ] ) , but instead solve eq.([eq : reqns_circ ] ) numerically .",
    "we then use eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mnew ] )  ( [ eq : anew ] ) to describe the remnant .",
    "two examples , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , are shown in fig .. we show @xmath54 as a function of @xmath61 and @xmath58 .",
    "consider the @xmath59 results first .",
    "for a broad range of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the remnant spins relatively slowly .",
    "in many cases , @xmath62 : over much of the parameter space , this hole is spun _ down _ by the merger .",
    "rapid rotation follows only if the larger hole was already spinning rapidly and plunge occurred at shallow inclination ( @xmath63 ) . nearly nonspinning remnants form near @xmath64 , @xmath65 :",
    "the retrograde orbit cancels the hole s spin .",
    "this requires @xmath66 when @xmath67 , the spin orientation changes very little by the merger .",
    "by contrast , when @xmath68 , the spin is overwhelmed by the plunging body , and the orientation aligns with the plunge angle .",
    "whereas about half of the parameter space for @xmath59 leads to remnants with spin @xmath69 , the half - area contour when @xmath60 is at spin @xmath70 .    the slow spin of most remnants spin is simply understood .",
    "angular momentum at the lso depends strongly on inclination  cf .  the fit ( [ eq : xi_lso ] ) .",
    "the magnitude @xmath71 is small for prograde orbits and large for retrograde orbits .",
    "thus @xmath71 is smallest when it tends to augment the spin ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 nearly parallel ) and is largest when it tends to cancel ( @xmath72 and @xmath74 nearly antiparallel ) . on average , the hole tends to spin down .",
    "this tendency breaks at large @xmath56 , when @xmath73 overwhelms @xmath75 .",
    "the spin of the remnant is then dominated by the orbit at plunge .",
    "after a hole grows above a certain mass , its subsequent spin evolution may be stochastic .",
    "this limit may be described by a fokker - planck equation , combining the secular and diffusive changes in the hole s characteristics .",
    "we treat @xmath76 and @xmath77 as independent variables , so that the distribution function ( per unit volume @xmath77 space ) @xmath78 evolves via @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the @xmath81-th component of @xmath77 , @xmath82 and angle brackets mean to average over its distribution [ see , e.g. , pathria ( 1972 ) , lifshitz & pitaevski ( 1980 ) ] .",
    "we restrict our attention to a population of black holes that are born with a specific mass and spin .",
    "this solution can be used to integrate over a broad initial population .",
    "we also will limit our quantitative analysis to an isotropic distribution of ( small ) merging holes ; generalization to an anisotropic distribution is straightforward though lengthy .",
    "we rewrite eq .",

    "the fokker - planck approach works well for @xmath95 , and is easily supplemented by direct sums ( as in sec .",
    "[ subsec : major ] ) for major mergers .",
    "the fokker - planck coefficients can be used to understand semi - quantitatively the evolution of holes that grow through minor mergers .",
    "the change in @xmath77 is dominated by the resistive term for @xmath96 , which is the case for @xmath97 . in this case , the fluctuations about the average evolution are small .",

    "the spin dies away somewhat faster because the magnitude of the change for retrograde captures is larger than that of prograde captures .",
    "the orientation evolves diffusively .",
    "after growing by @xmath101 , the typical misalignment is @xmath102 significant realignment in a single merger occurs only if @xmath103 , in accord with eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcrit ] ) .",
    "we have argued that a hole is unlikely to acquire rapid spin through mergers .",
    "turn to the converse problem : if we believe that a black hole is spinning with @xmath104 , how many minor mergers can it have experienced ?",
    "to be specific , suppose that the hole is born through gravitational collapse or is spun up by accretion to @xmath105 .",
    "if we assume that the hole spun down to its current value by capture from an isotropic distribution of minor mergers , then as @xmath106 for @xmath107 , the mass acquired must satisfy @xmath108 rapidly spinning holes are extremely unlikely to have suffered a recent merger ; their spin must either be original or due to accretion .",
    "we find that the remnant of a major merger is rarely rapidly rotating : rapid rotation follows only if the larger binary member spun rapidly before merger _ and _ the plunge was nearly prograde ; or , if the binary s mass ratio @xmath109 .",
    "given the variety of black hole masses seen in galaxies , mergers with @xmath109 should be rare ; given the small volume of parameter space leading to rapid rotation , serendipitous configurations leading to a rapid rotation should also be rare .",
    "mounting evidence , mostly from spiral galaxies , suggests that in many cases massive black holes nonetheless rapidly rotate [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "our results strongly suggest that this spin can not come from mergers [ e.g.  @xcite ] but , instead , is consistent with the view that black hole mass ( and spin ) is assembled radiatively [ e.g.@xcite ] .",
    "the spin evolution of a hole that grows by repeated minor mergers is neatly described by a fokker - planck equation [ eq .  ( [ eq : fp ] ) ] , taking a particularly simple form if the mergers arise from an isotropic cluster . in this case",
    ", the evolution has a secular component , which is approximately described by a `` doctrine of original spin '' [ @xmath110 remains roughly constant while @xmath12 grows ; cf .",
