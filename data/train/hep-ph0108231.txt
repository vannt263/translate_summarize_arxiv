    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) sets in where the operator product expansion ( ope ) stops ( table [ tab : fermi ] ) .",
    "hadronic matrix elements of quark operators are calculated with an effective field theory directly in terms of hadron fields .",
    "the theory shares the symmetries of the effective theory of three light quarks , gluons , photon and leptons derived from the standard model via the ope at a scale of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "the step from @xmath4 down to @xmath5 entails an enormous loss of information that is encoded in the coupling constants ( lecs ) of the effective chiral lagrangian @xmath6 in table [ tab : eftsm ] .",
    "all the lagrangians in table [ tab : eftsm ] are used in present - day chpt calculations of kaon decays .    0.1 in    ccc + @xmath7 & @xmath8 & quarks , gluons , leptons + & sm & gauge bosons , higgs + ope & @xmath9 & perturbative + @xmath4 & @xmath10 & light quarks , gluons + & & leptons , photon + symmetries & @xmath9 & nonperturbative + @xmath5 & @xmath6 & hadrons + & ( table [ tab : eftsm ] ) & leptons , photon + & & +    [ tab : fermi ]    0.1 in @xmath11    . _ effective chiral lagrangian @xmath6 of the sm relevant for kaon physics .",
    "the numbers in brackets denote the numbers of low - energy constants . _ [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     isospin breaking is an essential ingredient @xcite for the extraction of @xmath12 .",
    "however , a complete calculation to @xmath13 has been undertaken only recently @xcite .",
    "the relevant lagrangians of table [ tab : eftsm ] are @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the calculation of isospin conserving corrections of @xmath16 is also under way @xcite .",
    "let me concentrate here on the radiative corrections for @xmath17 decays @xcite . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the decay distribution takes the form @xmath19 with kinematical functions @xmath20 and form factors @xmath21 in terms of the dalitz variables @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "radiative corrections involve the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ kl3rc ] and bremsstrahlung of soft photons .",
    "the final result is a decay distribution of the same form as ( [ kl30 ] ) with @xmath24 the structure dependent corrections involving the interplay of qcd and qed are contained in @xmath25 whereas the universal qed corrections ( coulomb part of loop corrections + bremsstrahlung ) appear in the modified kinematical functions @xmath26 .",
    "the latter depend of course on the experimental conditions .    using this representation @xcite",
    ", the form factors @xmath25 can be extracted from the experimental data in a model independent way .",
    "this will allow for a more reliable determination of the form factors ( @xmath27 is still poorly known ) and also , as a consequence , of the ckm matrix element @xmath12 .",
    "numerical results will be available @xcite when these proceedings appear in print .",
    "the combination of ope and chpt provides a comprehensive framework for the analysis of * all * @xmath28 decays :    * the structure and the renormalization of @xmath6 are well understood including electromagnetic corrections . *",
    "significant advances have been achieved in the analysis of @xmath29 scattering ( related to @xmath0 decays ) .",
    "* @xmath16 , isospin breaking and electromagnetic corrections are being completed for semileptonic decays . *",
    "more work is needed to determine many of the lecs in order to make the scheme even more predictive .",
