    "in his seminal work ( in 1890 ) on celestial mechanics , henri poincar @xcite emphasized the relevance of the concept of _ homoclinic _ orbits in dynamical systems by stating :    `` ... _ rien nest plus propre  nous donner une ide de la complication de tous les problmes de dynamique _ ... ''    ( in a free translation to english : `` ... _ nothing is more adequate to give us an idea of the complexity of all problems in dynamics _ ... '' )    in fact , the history behind the introduction of this notion is fascinating : in a few words , h. poincar submitted a first version @xcite of his work to a competition in honor of g. mittag - leffler and financially support by the king oscar of sweden , but , after some comments of l. phragmn , it was discovered a mistake in part of his text related to the presence of homoclinic orbits . for nice accounts in english and french ( resp . ) on this beautiful chapter of the history of dynamical systems , see @xcite and @xcite ( resp . ) .    in modern language",

    "all homoclinic orbits to periodic points are transverse .",
    "the fundamental picture discovered by s. smale near a transverse homoclinic orbits to hyperbolic fixed points is the following .    in a nutshell",
    ", this picture means that , near a point @xmath15 which is transverse homoclinic to a hyperbolic fixed point @xmath12 , one can find a rectangle @xmath46 containing @xmath12 and @xmath15 such that some iterate @xmath47 of @xmath4 maps @xmath46 in the `` horseshoe''-shaped region @xmath48 shown above .",
    "moreover , the picture was drawn to convince the reader that the action of the differential @xmath49 of @xmath50 on @xmath46 uniformly contracts any almost horizontal direction and uniformly expand any almost vertical direction .    using these facts ,",
    "s. smale proved that the _ maximal invariant set _",
    "@xmath51 consisting of all points in @xmath46 whose orbit under @xmath50 never escapes @xmath46 is a _ hyperbolic set _ , that is , there are constants @xmath52 , @xmath53 and a splitting @xmath54 for each @xmath55 such that :    * the splitting is @xmath49-invariant : @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; * @xmath36 is uniformly contracted and @xmath37 is uniformly expanded : @xmath58 for all @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a norm associated to some choice of riemannian metric on @xmath1 .    in the case of our picture",
    "above , there is no mystery behind the choice of the splitting : @xmath63 is an almost horizontal direction and @xmath64 is an almost vertical direction .    furthermore , by using the hyperbolicity of the set @xmath65 , s. smale showed that the dynamics of @xmath50 restricted to @xmath65 is _ topologically conjugated to bernoulli shift in two symbols _ , that is , there exists a homeomorphism @xmath66 such that @xmath67 where @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 .",
    "in other words , the dynamics of @xmath70 can be modeled by a markov process .    among the several striking consequences of s. smale s results ,",
    "we observe that the set of periodic orbits of @xmath50 is dense in @xmath65 and the dynamical system @xmath70 is _ _ sensitive to initial conditions _ _ simply because the same is true for the bernoulli shift @xmath71 !",
    "in particular , s. smale s results allow one to recover the result of g. birkhoff ( mentioned above ) that the transverse homoclinic point @xmath15 of the hyperbolic periodic point @xmath12 is accumulated by periodic orbits of @xmath4 of arbitrarily high period .    by obvious reason , the maximal invariant set @xmath65 was baptized _ horseshoe _ by s. smale . partly motivated by this",
    ", we introduce the following concepts :    [ d.hyp-set]we say that a compact subset @xmath72 is a _",
    "hyperbolic set _ of a diffeomorphism @xmath0 if    * @xmath65 is @xmath4-invariant , that is , @xmath73 ; * there are constants @xmath52 , @xmath53 and a splitting @xmath54 for each @xmath55 with : * * @xmath74 and @xmath75 ; * * @xmath76 for all @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a norm associated to some choice of riemannian metric on @xmath1 .    in other words , @xmath72 is a hyperbolic set of a diffeomorphism @xmath0 whenever @xmath65 is @xmath4-invariant , and the differential @xmath77 completely decomposes @xmath78 into two @xmath77-equivariant subbundles @xmath36 and",

    "one of the key features of hyperbolic sets is the fact that the infinitesimal information on the structure of @xmath77 over a hyperbolic set @xmath65 imposes a certain number of global geometrical constraints on the dynamics of @xmath4 on @xmath65 .",
    "for example , given @xmath80 , denote by @xmath81 and @xmath82 the stable and unstable sets of @xmath83 .",
    "in general , the stable and unstable sets of an arbitrary point of an arbitrary diffeomorphism may have a _ wild _ geometry , such as fractal sets .",
    "on the other hand , as we already mentioned , it is known that the stable and unstable sets of hyperbolic periodic points are injectively immersed submanifolds thanks to the stable manifold theorem . in other words",
    ", the geometry of stable and unstable sets improves under appropriate hyperbolicity conditions , and , as it turns out , it is possible to generalize the stable manifold theorem to show that the stable and unstable sets of any point in a hyperbolic set has well - behaved stable and unstable sets :    let @xmath72 be a hyperbolic set of a @xmath27-diffeomorphism @xmath0 , @xmath28 .",
    "then , the stable set @xmath84 of any @xmath55 is an injectively immersed @xmath27-submanifold of dimension @xmath85 and , for all sufficiently small @xmath86 , the local stable set @xmath87 is a @xmath27 embedded disk in @xmath84 of dimension @xmath85 . also , the stable sets @xmath84 depend continuously on @xmath55 and @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , the map @xmath88 is continuous .",
    "another way of phrasing the previous theorem is : given a hyperbolic set @xmath65 , the family of stable sets @xmath84 of points @xmath55 form a continuous _ lamination _ with @xmath27 leaves .",
    "actually , this is not the full statement of the generalized stable manifold theorem . for more complete statements",
    "see appendix 1 of @xcite and references therein ( especially @xcite ) .    coming back to the discussion of smale s horseshoes , it turns out that they are not arbitrary hyperbolic sets in the sense that they fit the following definitions :    [ d.basic-set ] a set @xmath72 is a _ basic set _ of a diffeomorphism @xmath0 if @xmath65 is an _",

    "the notion of basic set is natural in our setting because the transitivity and local maximality properties allow one to show that the hyperbolicity of @xmath65 is a robust property in the sense that the set @xmath93 ( called _ continuation _ of @xmath65 ) is a hyperbolic set whenever @xmath94 is sufficiently @xmath27-close to @xmath4 .",

    "concerning this definition , let us mention that in these notes we ll focus exclusively on saddle - type hyperbolic sets because they are the most relevant for the study of homoclinic / heteroclinic bifurcations ( as in this context we need , by definition , both stable and unstable manifolds ) .",
    "however , it is worth it to point out that the dynamics of attractors and/or repellors ( i.e. , the situations where either @xmath36 or @xmath37 is trivial ) is also very exciting and it is not surprising that they have a vast literature dedicated to them ( see for instance the book @xcite and references therein ) .    from the qualitative point of view , a uniformly hyperbolic horseshoe @xmath65 of a diffeomorphism @xmath4 behaves exactly as a smale s horseshoe near a transverse homoclinic orbit .",
    "for instance , it is possible to show that the restriction @xmath4 to @xmath65 is topologically conjugated to a markov shift of finite type . in particular",
    ", @xmath65 is topologically a _ _ cantor set _ _ , and , despite the fact that the dynamics of @xmath95 is _ chaotic _",

    "this localization of the dynamics of @xmath94 on @xmath134 to the region @xmath515 is useful because it allows us to think of @xmath134 in terms of an _ iterated system of maps _",

    "that is , @xmath94-iterates whose derivates expand the horizontal direction and contract the vertical direction , will contribute to the hyperbolicity of @xmath134 .",
    "in other words , it is desirable to get as much affine - like iterates as possible . of course , the @xmath94-iterates obtained by composition of transition maps @xmath511 related to the horseshoe @xmath154 have affine - like features ( by definition ) , so that one risks losing the affine - like property only when one considers compositions with the folding map @xmath518 ( because the folding map mixes up the horizontal and vertical directions ) .",
    "in particular , this suggests that the strong regularity property has something to do with the consecutive passages through the critical region given by the parabolic tongues @xmath491 and @xmath492 .",

    "from now on , let us fix @xmath589 a strongly regular parameter , and let s study @xmath134 for @xmath473 . keeping this goal in mind , we introduce @xmath590 the collection of all affine - like iterates of @xmath94 coming from the strongly regular intervals @xmath585 . using the class @xmath591 , we can define the class @xmath592 of _ stable curves _ ,",

    "these stable curves were introduced by analogy with uniformly hyperbolic horseshoes : indeed , the stable lamination of @xmath154 can be recovered from the transitions maps @xmath511 by looking at the decreasing sequences of domains of simple compositions of these transitions maps .    from the nice features of strong regular parameters , it is possible to prove that the class @xmath592 is a @xmath598-lamination and one can use @xmath94 to induce a dynamical system @xmath599 isomorphic to a bernoulli map with infinitely many branches ( cf .",

    "of course , by the symmetry between past and future ( see remark [ r.past-future ] ) , one also has an analogous non - uniformly hyperbolic dynamical system @xmath604 on unstable curves , so that @xmath134 inherits a natural _ non - uniformly hyperbolic part _ consisting of points whose @xmath603 and @xmath605 iterates never escape @xmath592 and @xmath606 .    therefore , if we can show that the size of the sets of the points of @xmath134 escaping @xmath592 or @xmath606 is relatively small compared to the non - uniformly hyperbolic part of @xmath134 , then we can say that @xmath134 is a _ non - uniformly hyperbolic horseshoe_. here , j. palis and j .- c .",

    "firstly , as it is pointed out in page 14 of @xcite , the philosophy that @xmath134 is constituted of a non - uniformly hyperbolic part and an exceptional set makes them expect that one could improve the information on the geometry of @xmath607 or @xmath134 .",
    "as it turns out , we will discuss in the second part of this text some recent results in this direction .",
    "finally , condition is not expected to be sharp by any means , but it seems that the strongly regular parameters are not sufficient to go beyond , so that it is likely that one has to exclude further parameters in order to improve theorem [ t.py ] .",
    "in what follows , we will consider the same setting of the article @xcite of j. palis and j .- c .",
    "yoccoz , and we will discuss a recent improvement ( obtained in collaboration with j. palis and j .- c .",
    "yoccoz ) on theorem [ t.py-thm7 ] above .",
    "in particular , _ all _ statements below concern the dynamics of @xmath134 where @xmath473 and @xmath383 is a strongly regular parameter in the sense of @xcite : in other words , in the sequel , we do not have to exclude further parameters in order to get our ( slightly improved ) statements .",
    "the main result of this part of the text is :      logically , this result improves theorem [ t.py-thm7 ] because any subset of the compact @xmath135-dimensional manifold @xmath1 with hausdorff dimension strictly smaller than @xmath135 has zero @xmath135-dimensional lebesgue measure .",
    "[ [ hausdorff - dimension - of - the - stable - sets - of - non - uniformly - hyperbolic - horseshoes ] ] hausdorff dimension of the stable sets of non - uniformly hyperbolic horseshoes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~        now , we separate @xmath612 into its good ( non - uniformly hyperbolic ) part and its exceptional part as follows : @xmath613 in other words , the good part of @xmath612 consists of points passing by the nice set @xmath614 of stable curves and the exceptional set @xmath615 is , _ by definition _ , the complement of the good part .",
    "the set @xmath614 is the `` good '' ( non - uniformly hyperbolic ) part of the dynamics and hence it is not surprising that j. palis and j .- c .",
    "yoccoz showed in section 10 of @xcite that @xmath614 has hausdorff dimension @xmath616 where @xmath617 is close to the stable dimension @xmath343 of the initial horseshoe @xmath96 .",
    "now , we follow the discussion of section 11.7 of @xcite to decompose @xmath615 by looking at successive passages through _ parabolic cores _ of strips . more concretely , given an element @xmath619 , we define the _ parabolic core _ @xmath620 of @xmath524 as @xmath621 here , a child @xmath622 of @xmath524 is a @xmath623 such that @xmath624 but there is no @xmath625 with @xmath626 .",
    "the geometry of a parabolic core @xmath627 of @xmath628 is depicted below :      by checking the definitions ( of good part and exceptional set ) , it is not hard to convince oneself that @xmath615 can be decomposed as @xmath630 where @xmath631 and the sets @xmath632 are inductively defined as @xmath633 , @xmath634 , @xmath635 ( cf . equations ( 11.57 ) to ( 11.63 ) in @xcite ) . here",
    ", we say that @xmath636 is _ admissible _ if @xmath637 .",
    "as the picture above indicates , the fact that the points of @xmath637 pass by successive parabolic cores imposes strong conditions over the elements @xmath638 : for instance , the parabolic core @xmath639 of any @xmath640 is non - empty , the horizontal bands @xmath641 are always critical and , because we re dealing @xmath473 where @xmath383 is a strongly @xmath579-regular parameter , the following estimate holds :      this lemma is crucial for our purposes because it says that the exceptional set is confined into regions whose widths are decaying in a double exponential way to zero .",
    "note that this is in sharp contrast with the case of the stable set of the initial horseshoe ( which is confined into regions whose widths are going exponentially to zero ) : in other words , this lemma is a quantitative way of saying that the set @xmath615 is exceptional when compared with the stable lamination of the horseshoe @xmath154 .    in any event ,",
    "the lemma above allow us to estimate the hausdorff @xmath646-measure of @xmath632 . by definition , we know that a certain @xmath94-iterate of @xmath632 is contained in the parabolic core @xmath627 . on the other hand , as it is shown in the figure below , we know that @xmath627 is contained in a vertical strip of width @xmath647 and height @xmath648 ( see proposition 62 of  @xcite ) .",
    "we divide into @xmath649 squares of dimensions @xmath650 aligned along a vertical strip is motivated by the fact that we do not want to keep track of the fine geometry of @xmath632 because it gets complicated very fast . ]",
    "this vertical strip containing @xmath627 into @xmath651 squares of sides of lengths @xmath652 and we analyze individually their evolution under the dynamics by an inductive procedure . more precisely , at the @xmath653-th step of our procedure , we have @xmath654 squares of dimensions @xmath655 inside @xmath641 .",
    "we fix one of these squares and we note that @xmath656 sends this square into a vertical strip of width @xmath657 and height @xmath658 because @xmath659 is affine - like .",
    "again , we divide this vertical strip into @xmath660 squares of sides of length @xmath661 ( similarly to figure [ f.17 ] ) . of course , during each step of this backward inductive procedure , we need to verify the compatibility condition @xmath662 . in the present case ,",
    "this compatibility condition is automatically satisfied in view of the estimate of lemma  [ l.24 ] .    in particular , at the final step of this argument , we obtain a covering of @xmath632 by a collection of @xmath663 squares of sides of length @xmath664 .",
    "thus , we have that @xmath665 since @xmath666 for any @xmath667 sufficiently close to @xmath135 , we can use lemma  [ l.24 ] to see that the right - hand side of can be estimated by @xmath668 let us take @xmath669 a real number very close to @xmath670 and rewrite the previous expression as @xmath671 applying again lemma  [ l.24 ] , we can bound this expression by @xmath672 where @xmath673 .",
    "however , the hypothesis ( h4 ) of  @xcite forces @xmath674 , so that @xmath675 for any @xmath676 .",
    "it follows that @xmath677 now we use two facts derived in the pages 204 and 205 of  @xcite .",
    "firstly , they show that the number of admissible sequences @xmath636 with fixed extremities @xmath678 and @xmath679 is @xmath680 ( see equation ( 11.77 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , the sum @xmath681 is bounded because the results of the subsection 11.5.9 of  @xcite show that @xmath682 converges is hidden in this estimate . ]",
    "provided that @xmath683 .",
    "putting these two facts together with  , we see that the hausdorff @xmath646-measure of @xmath684 at scale @xmath685 satisfies @xmath686 because @xmath687 as @xmath688 , this proves that @xmath689 .",
    "hence , the proof of theorem  [ t.mpy ] is complete .",
    "the arguments of the previous subsection were based on _ soft analysis _ of the geometry of the exceptional set .",
    "every time the shape of the parabolic cores @xmath639 was ready to get complicated , we divide it into squares and we analyzed the evolution of individual squares .",
    "in particular , every time we saw some parabolic geometry , we covered the `` tip of the parabola '' by a black box ( square ) and we forgot about the finer details of @xmath615 in this region .",
    "of course , it is not entirely surprising that this kind of soft estimate works to show @xmath690 , but it is too crude if one wishes to compute the actual value of @xmath691 .    in particular , if one desires to prove that @xmath615 is really exceptional so that @xmath691 is close to the expected dimension @xmath692 , one has to somehow face the geometry of @xmath615 and its successive passages through parabolic cores @xmath639 .    in the forthcoming article @xcite ,",
    "we improve the soft strategy above without entering too much into the fine geometry of @xmath615 by noticing that each @xmath632 is the image of the parabolic core @xmath627 with a map of the form @xmath693 ( obtained by alternating compositions of affine - like iterates of @xmath94 and the folding map @xmath518 ) whose derivative and jacobian can be reasonably controlled . using this control , we can study the hausdorff @xmath646-measure of @xmath615 at certain fixed scales @xmath685 in terms of the geometry of @xmath627 and the bounds on the derivative and the jacobian of the map sending @xmath627 into @xmath615 . by putting forward this estimate",
    ", we can show that @xmath607 has the expected hausdorff dimension ( namely @xmath616 ) in a certain subregion @xmath694 of values of stable and unstable dimensions @xmath343 and @xmath344 of the initial horseshoe .",
    "in figure [ f.18 ] below we depicted in wave texture the region @xmath695 inside the larger region @xmath696 .",
    "actually , in this picture we drew only @xmath695 because the other half @xmath697 of @xmath694 can be deduced by symmetry .",
    "the intersection @xmath699 of the region @xmath694 with the diagonal ( corresponding to the `` _ _ conservative case _ _ '' ) can be explicitly computed ( see @xcite ) : @xmath700 in particular , by putting this together with figure [ f.18 ] , we see that @xmath694 occupies slightly less than half of region given by palis - yoccoz condition .",
    "finally , let us remark that we get the expected hausdorff dimensions for @xmath607 and @xmath608 ( in region @xmath694 ) , but the arguments can not be used to get the expected hausdorff dimension for @xmath701 .",
    "in fact , our constructions so far start from the future of @xmath607 and the past of @xmath608 where some geometric control is available , e.g. , in the form of nice partitions , and then it tries to bring back the information , i.e. , partitions , by analyzing the @xmath94-iterates used in our way back to the present time . of course",
    ", this works if we deal separately with the past or the future .",
    "if we try to deal with both at the same time , we run into trouble because it is not obvious how the partitions coming from the future and the past intersect in the present time ( due to the lack of transversality produced by @xmath94-iterates related to the folding map @xmath518 ) .",
    "evidently , the question of getting the expected hausdorff dimension for @xmath134 is natural and interesting , and we hope to address this issue in @xcite ."
