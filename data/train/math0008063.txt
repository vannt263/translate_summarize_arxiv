    "there have been two very successful approaches to generate aperiodic sets with features of long - range internal order .",
    "the first is by creating tilings by the method of inflation followed by decomposition using a finite set of proto - tiles .",
    "the second is by creating point sets through the method of cut and project sets , or model sets as we call them here .",
    "neither theory subsumes the other and they both have their own particular virtues .",
    "however , they have a considerable overlap .",
    "it is easy to replace a tiling by an equivalent set of points ( by selecting suitable points from each type of tile ) and in many cases the result is a model set or , more generally , a union of several model sets , one for each type of point .",
    "conversely , there are many ways to obtain a tiling from a point set ( for instance by using the voronoi cells , or the dual delone cells determined by them ) , and the equivalence concept of mutual local derivability , see @xcite and references given there , is an adequate tool to make this connection precise .",
    "so it is natural to study the most notable feature of inflation tilings , namely their self - similarity , in the context of model sets , and indeed , even when no simple tiling is in sight , many interesting model sets have striking self - similarity .",
    "the objective of this paper is to set up some of the machinery that makes such a study possible and to show how naturally it can be associated with families of self - similar measures on locally compact abelian groups .",
    "there is one initial hurdle which is not usually considered in the study of model sets . in order to have any sort of reasonable correspondence with the tiling world , and to create a useful theory , we need to have a _",
    "multi - component _ model set context in which there are a finite number of model sets , all based on the same cut and project scheme , that are mutually coupled by the self - similarities . after all , almost all inflation tiling systems have several types of tiles , and the decomposition of inflated tiles typically involves all of these various types simultaneously .",
    "thus the situation that we envision consists of a _ family _ of model sets @xmath0 in some real space @xmath1 , all based on the same cut and project scheme , and a set of families of inflationary mappings @xmath2 on @xmath1 with the property that @xmath3    there are two new features that are different from the tiling situation . in inflation tilings ,",
    "the usual idea is that the tiles only overlap on their boundaries which are of measure @xmath4 .",
    "that would be equivalent to some form of disjointness in eq.([inflationequationintro ] ) which we do _ not _ wish to assume .",
    "secondly , in tilings , the sets @xmath2 of mappings are assumed finite .",
    "again , we do _ not _ wish to make this assumption .",
    "in fact , it is quite useful to make @xmath2 consist of _ all _ possible mappings of a certain type ( for example all affine mappings ) that are consistent with eq.([inflationequationintro ] ) , and this is in general an infinite set .",
    "as soon as overlapping is allowed , there naturally arises the question of whether there is implicit in eq .",
    "( [ inflationequationintro ] ) a corresponding set of relative weights which measure the  frequency \" of occurrence of the points of @xmath5 coming from the substitution process ( [ inflationequationintro ] ) .",
    "if we were counting , this could be loosely construed as noting the occurrences of points of @xmath5 with their multiplicities as they appear in the righthand side of ( [ inflationequationintro ] ) .",
    "this links up to a recent approach of lagarias and wang @xcite .",
    "however , in our situation , there is no reason to assume that our weights can be normalized to be integral nor that there are only a finite number of contributions to @xmath5 in the right - hand side of ( [ inflationequationintro ] ) .",
    "this then is the primary goal of this contribution : to discuss the existence and nature of self - similar densities on systems of model sets which are coupled together by a substitution system of type ( [ inflationequationintro ] ) .",
    "our definition of model sets is based on arbitrary locally compact abelian groups as internal spaces , and so is more flexible and handles more situations ( see for instance @xcite ) than the usual method of projection from euclidean spaces .",
    "this extra generality requires a little more care than usual but it is remarkable how much of the theory is natural in this context .",
    "the method by which we attack the problem is to use the formalism of the underlying cut and project scheme to pass everything over to the internal side of the picture , i.e.  onto the locally compact abelian group that is controlling the projection .",
    "the advantage of doing this is that the system of inflationary mappings turns into a family of contractions , and what has started off as a problem in the domain of discrete mathematics turns into one of analysis .",
    "a primary virtue of systems of contractions is the ready - built hutchinson theory of iterated function systems with their attractors and self - similar measures . in our multi - component",
    "setting with infinite families of mappings , we need a slight variation on this theme , which occupies the first five sections of the paper .",
    "these parts of the paper have nothing in particular to do with model sets , but rather are a development of hutchinson s theory in the multi - component situation where the coupling is by _ compact _ families of contractions each of which has its own , essentially arbitrarily pre - given positive borel measure .",
    "an important part of this is determining some conditions under which the self - similar measures are in fact absolutely continuous and , more importantly , when the representing @xmath6-functions , the radon - nikodym densities , are actually continuous ( continuously representable self - similar measures ) , for it is only then that we can bring back information to the discrete side again .",
    "section [ model - weyl ] of this article brings in the model sets and develops the mathematics that allows us to pass information back from the internal side to the model set side in @xmath1 .",
    "the primary tool here is weyl s theory of uniform projection , but we have to redevelop this in the context of locally compact abelian groups and model sets .    in section [ model - dens ]",
    "we are , at last , set to tackle the problem of determining self - similar distribution of weights ( also called self - similar densities from now on ) on the model sets themselves .",
    "the weyl theory applies only to continuous functions , so we can only refer to it when our self - similar measures have continuously representable radon - nikodym densities .",
    "fortunately , this is the case in a number of interesting situations .",
    "we provide a general description of the situations in which such self - similar densities exist , and then , in section [ sec - examples ] , we offer a number of examples which illustrate what we have achieved .",
    "the results obtained here extend those of two previous papers @xcite .",
    "there , we considered only model sets based on euclidean internal spaces , and the context was not primarily measure - theoretical as it is here .",
    "the method of dealing with multi - component model sets also differed from the product approach that we have adopted in this article .",
    "there are nonetheless several examples of self - similar densities ( called invariant densities there ) in those papers which the reader may find of interest .",
    "let us first review some basic facts from the theory of iterated function systems , both finite and compact , in a way that is adequate for our needs .",
