    "reproducing the spectrum of baryon resonances with spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 and both parities is an important test of lattice qcd . for that we require three - quark operators that transform irreducibly under the spinorial rotation group of the lattice @xcite .",

    "we analyze @xmath5 spectra using these operators .    to determine the @xmath5 excited states , a matrix of correlation functions is computed in the quenched approximation to qcd using irreducible baryon interpolating operators @xmath6 of definite quantum numbers , @xmath7 the @xmath8 matrices for @xmath9 and @xmath10 states for each parity",

    "the computation of masses of the lowest - lying resonances is based on the variational method applied to the matrix of correlation functions . in this paper",
    "we solve the generalized eigenvalue equation , @xmath11 and determine eigenvectors @xmath12 for each @xmath13 , with @xmath14 close to the source time .",

    "this feature may be helpful in extracting masses of excited states .",

    "the parameters of the wilson fermion action are tuned nonperturbatively so as to satisfy the continuum dispersion relation @xmath23 at a pion mass @xmath24 mev . to improve the coupling of operators to the lower mass states we employ gauge - covariant smearing of the quark fields on both source and sink :",
