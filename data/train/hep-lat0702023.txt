    "we are in the age of renaissance of hadron spectroscopy , initiated by the announcement of the pentaquark baryon @xcite , which is followed by the discovery of many other possible exotic hadrons with a mass larger than 2 gev containing heavy quarks@xcite .",
    "these experimental developments prompted the intensive theoretical studies of qcd dynamics with new as well as old ideas on the structure and dynamics of the exotic hadrons , such as chiral dynamics@xcite , multi - quark states with diquark correlations or molecular states and hybrids@xcite .",
    "such a controversy on the structure of hadrons is also the case for the scalar mesons below 1 gev : the existence of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 meson , i.e. , the @xmath11 , has been reconfirmed @xcite after around twenty years not only in @xmath12@xmath13 scattering but also in various decay processes from heavy - quark systems , _",
    "e.g. _ , d @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the resonance of a scalar meson with @xmath16 is also reported to exist in the k-@xmath12 system with a mass @xmath17 of about 800 mev @xcite .",
    "this meson is called the @xmath0 meson and may constitute the nonet scalar state together with the @xmath18 meson .",
    "see fig.[fig : nonet ] .     and @xmath19 mesons may be ideal mixing states of singlet state @xmath20 and octet state @xmath21 .",
    "there is , however , experimental evidence that the @xmath18 meson consist of only @xmath22 and @xmath23 components .",
    "hence , we take the @xmath18 wave function given in the figure . ]",
    "the problem is the nature of these low - lying scalar mesons @xcite : they can not be ordinary @xmath24 mesons as described in the non - relativistic constituent quark model since in such a quark model , the @xmath25=@xmath26 meson is realized in the @xmath27 state , which implies that the mass of the @xmath18 meson must be as high as 1.2 @xmath28 1.6 gev .",
    "thus , the low - lying scalar mesons below 1 gev have been a source of various ideas of exotic structures , as mentioned above : they may be four - quark states such as @xmath29 @xcite , or @xmath30 or k@xmath12 molecules as the recent high - lying exotic hadrons can be .",
    "these mesons may be _ collective _ @xmath24 states described as a superposition of many _ atomic _",
    "@xmath24 states @xcite . a mixing with glueball states",
    "is also possible @xcite .    in the previous work@xcite ,",
    "we have presented a lattice calculation for the @xmath18 meson , by full lattice qcd simulation on the @xmath31 lattice using the plaquette action and wilson fermions : we have shown that the disconnected diagram plays an essential role in order to make the @xmath18 meson mass light .",
    "the importance of the disconnected diagram suggests that the wave function of the @xmath18 meson may have a significant four - quark , a collective @xmath32-@xmath33 or an even glueball component , although the smallness of the lattice requires caution in giving a definite conclusion .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath18 meson , the @xmath0 is a flavor non - singlet state with which a glueball state can not mix . in previous reports @xcite",
    ", we reported also a preliminary analysis on the @xmath0 meson using the dynamical fermion for the @xmath34 quark but using the valence approximation for the @xmath35 quark , which shows that the @xmath16 scalar meson has a mass as large as about 1.8 gev and can not be identified with the @xmath0 meson observed in experiments .",
    "the lattice volume in the previous investigations was admittedly too small to yield a definite conclusion at all , and the lattice cutoff was not appropriately chosen to accommodate large masses : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the lattice spacing .",
    "hence , we present a simulation with weaker couplings on a larger lattice than any other previous simulations although in the quenched level . we perform quenched level simulations on the @xmath0 meson so as _ to clarify the structure of the mysterious scalar meson rather than to reproduce the experimental value of the mass _ ; a precise quenched - level simulation should give a rather clear perspective on whether the system can fit with the simple constituent - quark model picture or not .",
    "we perform a quenched qcd calculation using the wilson fermions , with the plaquette gauge action , on a relatively large lattice ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the values of the hopping parameter for the @xmath39 quark are @xmath40 and 0.1574 , while @xmath41 and 0.1557 for the @xmath35 quark . using these hopping parameters except for @xmath42 ,",
    "cp - pacs collaboration performed a quenched qcd calculation of the light meson spectrum with a larger lattice ( @xmath43 ) @xcite , which we refer to for comparison .",
    "the gauge configurations are generated by the heat bath algorithm at @xmath44 .",
    "after 20000 thermalization iterations , we start to calculate the meson propagators . on every 2000 configurations ,",
    "80 configurations are used for the ensemble average .",
    "we emply the point - like source and sink for the @xmath45 meson @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the dirac operators for the @xmath39 and @xmath35 quarks , and the indices @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the color and dirac - spinor indices , respectively . the point source and sink in eq.([eq : kappa_operator ] ) lead a positive spectral function @xmath51 in the correlation function @xmath52 .",
    "the result obtained here is thus an upper bound of @xmath0 mass , because our result should include excited states .",
    "first , we check finite lattice volume effects by comparing our results for the @xmath12 and @xmath53 masses as well as the mass ratio @xmath54 with those of the cp - pacs group .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ table : pi_rho ] .",
    "our result for the @xmath53 meson mass is only slightly ( @xmath55 5 @xmath56 ) larger than the cp - pacs s result .",
    "the resulting larger value is reasonable because the smaller lattice size gives rise to a mixture of higher mass states .",
    "we rather emphasize that the deviation between our results and the larger lattice result ( cp - pacs ) is so small in spite of the large difference in the lattice size .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    @xmath57 inputs for calculation of physical value of @xmath58 .",
    "see the text .     and",
    "@xmath59 at chiral limit , and @xmath60 for @xmath35 quark hopping parameters @xmath58 = 0.1566 and 0.1557 . ]",
    "we have searched for the physical value of the @xmath35 quark hopping parameter @xmath58 in the following two ways , both of which are found to give similar results : 1 )   by tracing a regression line for @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_ratio ] ) , we have @xmath58 = 0.1563(3 ) ( or @xmath61 = 6.396(13 ) ) for @xmath62=1019[mev]/892.0[mev]=1.143 ( input ) , taken from the pdg @xcite .",
    "this hopping parameter gives the mass ratio @xmath59 = @xmath63 .",
    "2 )   we have also determined the hopping parameter so as to reproduce the mass ratio @xmath64 = 495.6[mev]/892[mev ] = 0.5556 , with @xmath65 [ mev ] being the average value of the kaon masses given in the pdg @xcite . the resulting value is found to be @xmath58 = 0.1576(2 ) ( or @xmath61 = 6.3452(80 ) ) , which in turn gives the mass ratio @xmath59 = 2.00(80 ) . the mass ratios obtained using methods 1 ) and 2 ) are also presented in table [ table : mass_ratio ] . both methods give almost identical results for the masses of the @xmath0 , that are about twice that of the @xmath66 .",
    "the motivation of our lattice study is to reveal the nature of the scalar meson nonet , and the results should be important especially in clarifying how the @xmath0 meson with a reported low mass @xmath67 mev obtained from experiments can be compatible with the valence or constituent quark model : the @xmath0 is a @xmath68-wave @xmath24 bound state in the non - relativistic quark model , and the @xmath0 meson constitutes a nonet together with the @xmath18 meson and the @xmath69 mesons .    there have not been many lattice studies of @xmath0 meson .",
    "recently , estimations of the @xmath0 meson have been reported by two groups .",
    "_ @xcite have presented a rough estimate of the mass of the @xmath0 as @xmath70 gev , which is obtained using the average quark mass of the @xmath71 and @xmath35 quarks from the dynamical simulations with the degenerate @xmath72 quarks on a @xmath73 lattice .",
    "et al . _ have studied @xmath74 meson with the overlap fermion in the quenched approximation and obtained a mass of the @xmath74 scalar meson to be 1.41 @xmath75 0.12 gev @xcite .",
    "the ukqcd collaboration has studied to some extent the @xmath0 meson using the dynamical @xmath76=2 sea quarks and a valence strange quark on a @xmath73 lattice @xcite ; they estimated the @xmath77 mass as about 1.1 gev , which is much smaller than those in @xcite but still far from the experimental value @xmath28800 mev .    in this paper",
    ", we have presented the lattice simulation results in the quenched approximation for the @xmath0 meson ; the results on the @xmath12 , @xmath53 , @xmath78 and @xmath66 mesons are also shown for comparison .    we have first checked that the masses of the @xmath12 , @xmath53 , @xmath78 and @xmath66 mesons obtained in our simulation are in good agreement with those on a larger lattice ( @xmath79 ) @xcite ; our results are only within five percent larger than the latter .",
    "our estimated value of the mass of the @xmath0 is @xmath28 1.7 gev , which is larger than twice the experimental mass @xmath67 mev .",
    "this result was expected on the basis of our experience in calculating the @xmath18 meson .",
    "the relatively heavy mass of the @xmath0 may be at least partly attributed to the absence of the disconnected diagram in the @xmath0 propagator ; the @xmath0 propagator is composed of only a connected diagram .",
    "while the disconnected diagram was essential for realizing the low - mass @xmath18 @xcite , it does not exist for the @xmath0 ; therefore , the mass of the @xmath0 is not made lighter by the disconnected diagram .",
    "indeed , the mass of the valence @xmath80 described solely with the connected propagator is far larger than the experimental value @xmath81-@xmath82 mev , as seen in table [ table : qqbar ] .",
    "our lattice study and the quark model analysis@xcite suggest that the simple two - body constituent - quark picture of the @xmath0 meson does not agree well with the experimentally observed @xmath0 .",
    "note that the quench simulation is a clean theoretical experiment in which a virtual intermediate like @xmath29 is highly suppressed @xcite .",
    "therefore , if its existence with the reported low mass is experimentally established , the dynamical quarks may play an essential role for making the @xmath0 mass so lighter or the @xmath0 may contain an unconventional state such as a @xmath29@xcite or @xmath83 molecular state@xcite , which are missing in the calculation here .    in order to establish this possible scenario , the systematic errors should be much reduced in future simulations .",
    "our statistics here is reasonably high ( 80 configurations separated by 2000 sweeps ) , and the standard meson masses have small error bars ; see fig.[fig : k * ] . on the contrary , as seen in fig.[fig : kappa ] , the effective mass of @xmath0 suffers from large errors for large @xmath84 , which may be due to a small overlap of the physical states .",
    "this is not surprising because @xmath0 is a p - wave meson , and expected to be extended .",
    "choosing more adequate extrapolation operators and with much higher statistics , we can study the dynamics of hadrons by comparing results in the quenched lattice qcd , full lattice qcd and various effective theories / models that include the constituent quark models with and without the tetra - quark structure , chiral effective theories .    * acknowledgment * t.k . is supported by grants - in - aid for scientific research from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( no .",
