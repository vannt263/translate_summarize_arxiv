    "is expected to be formed  @xcite .",
    "hard partons and heavy quarks , abundantly produced at lhc energies in initial hard scattering processes , are sensitive probes of the medium formed in the collision as they may lose energy by gluon bremsstrahlung while propagating through the medium itself .",
    "the attenuation ( quenching ) of leading hadrons and jets observed at rhic  @xcite is thought to be due to such a mechanism .",
    "the large masses of the charm and beauty quarks make them qualitatively different probes , since , on well - established qcd grounds , in - medium energy loss off massive partons is expected to be significantly smaller than off ` massless ' partons ( light quarks and gluons ) .",
    "therefore , a comparative study of the attenuation of massless and massive probes is a promising tool to test the coherence of the interpretation of quenching effects as energy loss in a deconfined medium and to further investigate the properties ( density ) of such medium .    in the first part of this paper ,",
    "we shortly summarize one of the widely used models of parton energy loss and we discuss how we used it in our simulation . in the second part , we show that the exclusive reconstruction of @xmath2 decays with alice allows to carry out the mentioned comparative quenching studies by measuring the _ nuclear modification factor _ of the d mesons transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) distribution @xmath4 which would be 1 if the aa collision was a mere superposition of independent nn collisions without nuclear or medium effects , and the d/@xmath5 ( d/@xmath6 ) ratio @xmath7",

    ". then ( fig .",

    "the number of scatterings of the radiated gluon is also proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the average energy loss of the parton is proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "the scale of the energy loss is set by the ` maximum ' energy of the radiated gluons , which depends on @xmath8 and on the properties of the medium : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the _ transport coefficient of the medium _ , defined as the average transverse momentum",

    "the integral of the energy distribution up to @xmath18 estimates the average energy loss of the initial parton : @xmath19 the average energy loss is therefore : proportional to @xmath20 and , thus , larger by a factor @xmath21 for gluons than for quarks ; proportional to the transport coefficient of the medium ; proportional to @xmath10 ; independent of the parton initial energy .",

    "other models  @xcite consider an explicit dependence of @xmath22 on the initial energy @xmath23 .",

    "the heavy - to - light suppression factor @xmath40 in ( [ eq : fhl ] ) increases ( less suppression ) as the heavy quark energy @xmath23 increases ( the mass becomes negligible ) and it decreases at large @xmath14 , indicating that the high - energy part of the gluon radiation spectrum is drastically suppressed by the dead cone effect .",
