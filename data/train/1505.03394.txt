    "broad absorption line quasars have been observed for over two decades .",
    "they spectra have blue - shifted absorption troughs .",
    "this features are usually linked with the outflow of highly ionized plasma .",
    "the velocities of outflow can reach up to 0.3 c @xcite .",
    "noteworthy is that , in general absorption , can have various origin @xcite , from structures closely bonded by gravity to central engine , followed by host galaxy environment and matter which lies in the line of sight between observer and agn .",
    "therefore , it is extremely difficult to exclude one forme of absorption from another and draw unambiguous threshold . to tackle this issue ,",
    "@xcite proposed the balnicity index ( bi ) , which accounts only for troughs 2000 km / s wide and blue - shifted more than 3000 km / s , to quantify the true broad absorption .",
    "however , bi is too restrictive since it excludes large number of quasars with significant absorption lines troughs or the so - called mini - bals with bi=0 .",
    "hence , @xcite suggested a more relaxed definition , the absorption index ( ai ) , which includes troughs no smaller than 1000 km / s .",
    "the fraction of broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ) among the whole quasar population varies from 15% to 26% depending on the definition used @xcite .",
    "recently , the radio , optical and x - ray studies of traditional bi quasars and absorption line ( ai ) quasars showed that they might be two independent classes of objects @xcite .",
    "however , this do not necessarily means that the classical bals and much weaker and narrower absorption lines must be produced in different line - forming regions .",
    "theoretical model of @xcite unifies the broad and narrow absorption features , suggesting they are formed in the same disc wind but the orientation of the source with respect to the observer changes their appearance or can even prevent us from detection of these lines .",
    "discovery of the existence of radio - loud balqsos gave us another opportunity to study the bal phenomenon .",

    "similar findings concerning balqsos have been recently reported in the work of @xcite .",
    "the missing flux density between vla and vlbi observations in some cases can be attributed to the low frequency remnant of the previous phase of the radio source activity @xcite .",
    "finally , two of our quasars ( 0928 + 4446 , 1018 + 0530 ) have been classified as flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and one ( 1405 + 4056 ) is a gps candidate @xcite .",
    "the radio morphology of these three sources ( 0928 + 4446 , 1018 + 0530 , 1405 + 4056 ) and their significant flux density variations reported in the literature imply they are blazar candidates ( @xcite , see also table  [ basic ] ) . comparing radio morphology of our sources with qso structures",
    "@xcite we conclude that they represent typical quasar geometries .",
    "additional parameter which can shed some light on the concept of orientation scenario is the brightness temperature which can be derived directly from interferometric observation or from the flux density variability . by imaging analysis ,",
    "the brightness temperature in the rest frame is calculated using following equation :    @xmath10    where _ c _ is the speed of light , @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath12 is the observed flux density at frequency @xmath13 , @xmath14 is a doppler factor , and @xmath15 is the angular diameter of a source .",
    "using values from table [ observation ] we estimated @xmath16 for components likely representing radio cores in our ai quasars . in the case of three flat spectrum sources ( 0928 + 4446 , 1018 + 0530 , 1223 + 5037 )",
    "the value of the brightness temperature is the highest among our ai quasars and exceeds @xmath17k",
    ".    the intrinsic brightness temperature of extragalactic radio sources should be in the range of @xmath18 .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is a theoretical limit which when it is exceeded leads to the well - known inverse compton catastrophe .",
    "the @xmath3 is an empirical value derived for a sample of variable extragalactic radio sources by @xcite . taking the second limit we estimated the minimum doppler factor that avoids the inverse compton catastrophe as follows : @xmath19 .",
    "afterwards we estimated the viewing angle @xmath15 of each object , defined as an angle between the jet axis and the observer , as the maximum of the following function @xcite :    @xmath20 \\label{theta}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the velocity of the jet and @xmath14 is a doppler factor .",
    "the obtained values of the viewing angle are @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for 0928 + 4446 , 1018 + 0530 and 1223 + 5037 , respectively . these are , however , the maximum allowed values which means that the viewing angles of the above quasars are @xmath25 .",
    "this result is in agreement with previously reported large flux density variations found in these objects .",
    "this in turn may imply that the sources can be larger and older than estimated by us based on the projected angular size .    , distribution for ai and bi quasars from parent sample .",
    "gaussian function was fitted to both distributions ( see sec .",
    "[ radiol ] ) . ]      in the next step , using the parent sample of balqsos ( 309 sources ) selected from @xcite we performed statistical studies concerning orientation of these objects .",
    "we also compared the properties of the two subgroups of sources , namely the ai quasars ( 204 objects ) and bi quasars ( 105 objects ) .",
    "the radio - to - optical ratio of the quasar core is thought to be a strong statistical indicator of orientation @xcite .",
    "an analysis of its distribution among balqsos can be another way to deal with the enigma of their nature .",
    "we adopted radio - loudness definition from @xcite : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a k - corrected radio absolute magnitude and @xmath2 is a galactic reddening corrected and k - corrected i - band absolute magnitude .",
    "if indeed radio - loudness parameter is indicative of line - of - sight orientation , then its large numbers , possibly @xmath28 , could mean close to the radio jet axis orientation .",
    "quasars with @xmath29 are thought to be viewed at small angles relative to the plane of the disk @xcite . since all our sources are unresolved by first we used their integrated 1.4-ghz flux densities as a core flux and assume the radio core spectral index and optical spectral index to be 0 and -0.5 respectively .",
    "the histogram in fig .",
    "[ counts2 ] shows the number of balqsos versus the radio - loudness parameter @xmath0 for both , bi and ai , samples .",
    "the result of kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test ( d=0.34 ) implies that both distributions are dissimilar at the 0.05 confidence level .",
    "histogram clearly hints that while @xmath0 rises ai sample outnumbers bi . while bi distribution peaks between 1.0 and 1.5 ( fitting gauss results in @xmath30 = 1.24 @xmath31 0.30 ) ai distribution is shifted and apex between 1.5 and 2.0 ( fitting gauss results in @xmath30 = 1.72 @xmath31 0.06 ) .",
    "thus , on average bi quasars are viewed closer to the disk plane than ai sources .",
    "the majority of ai objects observed by us in the vlbi technique have @xmath28 so they belongs to the tail of log@xmath0 distribution for ai quasars and constitute the most luminous subgroup of ai population .",
    "significant flux density variations can signal doppler boosting , which in turn indicates that a jet points close to the line of sight toward the observer .",
    "therefore the flux density variability is an another , independent way of orientation determination by estimating variability brightness temperature : @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the luminosity distance and @xmath34 is the variability time scale in the observer s frame .    following @xcite we performed radio variability analysis for the whole parent sample ( 309 sources ) .",
    "we compared flux density of quasars present in both , first and the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss;@xcite ) catalogues , to find significant changes .",
    "to classify the radio - loud balqso as variable source we computed the variability ratio ( vr ) and the significance of the radio flux density variability ( @xmath35 ) for each quasar as proposed by @xcite .",
    "balqsos with @xmath36 and @xmath37 where selected as candidate for variable sources .",
    "while vr @xmath38 1 may hint intrinsic flux density changes , value of significance proposed by @xcite @xmath35 = 3 , which suggests variability is instead taken a priori . nevertheless , to provide complementary data for sake of informative discussions we applied this threshold .",
    "total of 26 balqsos , 9 bi and 17 ai objects , have been selected for further studies .    ) vs. radio - loudness parameter @xmath0 for sources from table  [ variable ] .",
    "bi and ai quasars are indicated as circles and squares , respectively . ]    in the next step using equation [ var_eq ] we calculated variability brightness temperature for all quasars and estimated the viewing angle @xmath15 of each object using formula  [ theta ] as discussed in section  [ vlbi_tb ] .",
    "this time we took both , @xmath3 and @xmath5 limits , and we estimated the minimum doppler factor as follows : @xmath39 and @xmath40 . the maximum value of function [ theta ] for both , @xmath4 and @xmath6 , allowed us to determine the range where the maximum viewing angle of the quasar should be found .",
    "the obtained range of viewing angles is wide , reaching very large values in a few cases ( table  [ variable ] ) .",
    "one of the ai quasars from our vlbi sample , namely 0756 + 3714 , also show flux density variability and is listed in table  [ variable ] .",
    "we classified this source as a core - jet , although an alternative interpretation as double - lobed young radio source has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "the value of the vlbi brightness temperature of 0756 + 3714 is not high , but it is close to the equipartition limit of @xmath41 proposed by @xcite .",
    "it is however , much lower than the variability brightness temperature we obtained for this object .",
    "we suggest that the possible flux density variations ( sec .  [ not ] ) and very high value of the radio - loudness parameter allow for the core - jet classification of 0756 + 3714 .",
    "vlbi observations with higher angular resolution may help to resolve puzzle of radio morphology of this source .",
    "+   +      estimations of the upper limit of wieving angles @xmath15 show that @xmath15 can reach value as large as @xmath42 for ai and bi quasars with @xmath43 ( table  [ variable ] ) .",
    "this range changes as a function of radio - loudness parameter , log@xmath0 , what is well visible in figure  [ range ] .",
    "for the middle group , @xmath44 , where the peak of the ai quasars distribution is present , the viewing angles are less than @xmath45 .",
    "we are aware that the viewing angle analysis based only on the upper limits might be burdened with significant error",
    ". however , the obtained trend seems to be in agreement with recent report about radio - loudness parameter as an orientation indicator @xcite .",
    "we contrasted then the radio - loudness values with the absorption index ( ai ) for the whole parent sample ( fig .",
    "[ counts3 ] , top panel ) .",
    "it is visible that stronger absorption is associated with lower values of radio - loudness parameter , log@xmath46 .",
    "the same trend is present for bi quasars only ( fig .",
    "[ counts3 ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "this relationship however , is not so obvious for radio stronger ai quasars ( fig .",
    "[ counts3 ] , middle panel ) .",
    "nevertheless it can be noticed that the fraction of quasars with ai value grater than 2000 starts to drop for log@xmath47 .",
    "additionally vlbi observations of three ai quasars allowed us to verify this conclusion by independent viewing angles determination .",
    "the estimated values of the viewing angles of 0928 + 4446 , 1018 + 0530 and 1223 + 5037 amounts to @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "and the values of absorption index for these three objects are the ones of the lowest in our sample of ai quasars indicating relatively weak absorption ( table  [ basic ] ) .    based on our studies presented here",
    "we conclude that there exist a preferable orientation , possibly @xmath50 , in which absorbing screen reaches maximum covering factor .      in the qso unification scheme of @xcite ,",
    "both broad and narrow absorption lines are assumed to be formed in the same disc wind and orientation is the parameter which determines our ability to detect them as ai or bi sources . on the other hand , radio , optical and x - ray studies of bi and",
    "ai quasars revealed many differences between them indicating that they constitute two independent classes @xcite or are connected by the evolution of the flow scenario , namely the weaker and much narrower absorption lines may represent the late evolutionary stages of classical bals @xcite .",
    "the strong influence of evolution on broad absorption lines phenomenon is supported also by the radio observations of balqsos @xcite .",
    "the fact that most of radio - loud balqsos are compact , so young sources , introduced the scenario in which absorption lines are present in the early evolution phase of quasars .",
    "the results presented in this paper confirm the fact that ai and bi quasars are statistically independent .",
    "both groups of sources differ in the value of the absorption , its distribution versus the radio - loudness parameter and the radio - loudness distribution itself .",
    "stronger absorption is associated with smaller values of @xmath29 which in turn can indicate small inclination angles with respect to the disk plane .",
    "orientation is then indeed an important parameter determining the possibility of absorption line detection .",
    "however , there is another important conclusion that can be drawn from our studies of the relationship between the radio - loudness parameter and absorption .",
    "we have to emphasize that there is no correlation between the radio - loudness parameter and the ai / bi index since a large span of ai / bi values occur in each bin of log@xmath0 .",
    "therefore there has to be an additional factor which plays important role in balqso phenomenon .",
    "we think that the fact that strong absorption is connected with weak radio emission is not without significance here .",
    "we suggest that the radio characteristics of balqsos can be well explained by the already established evolutionary scheme of radio - loud agns and by the scenario of intermittent activity proposed for the weak compact ones @xcite .",
    "such intermittent behaviour can be directly connected with the properties of the black hole and accretion process but not with the radio evolution itself .",
    "for instance recent uv observations studies of radio - loud and radio - quiet balqsos show that they are statistically identical @xcite .",
    "both classes of objects differ only in radio emission which , as we discussed , is weak for some reason .",
    "balqso phenomenon is usually explained by either an orientation scenario in which structures responsible for bals are visible under specific inclinations or by an evolutionary scenario which connects bal with young stage of qso evolution . despite long and thorough discussion over the last 20 years",
    ", the ambiguity in the origin of broad absorption lines in agn spectra remains . to address this ,",
    "we have presented 1.7- , 5- and 8.4-ghz interferometric observations of 14 ai quasars ( bi = 0 ) and compared properties of ai and bi sources from a newly selected sample .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * all ai quasars but one have been resolved in vlbi observations showing typical for qsos , core - jet morphology .",
    "their high radio luminosities and compact sizes indicate they belong to the population of young agns .",
    "simultaneously the bright sources are a minority among absorption quasars and thus these ai objects belong to the tail of radio power distribution for ai quasars . * the statistical analysis of ai and bi sources shows that for the radio - loudness parameter , log@xmath0 , the distribution of ai and bi quasars differ significantly , peaking at 1.2 and 1.7 for bi and ai , respectively .",
    "notice that the strong absorption , which is exclusively visible in bi quasars , is connected with lower values of log@xmath0 and weak radio emission .",
    "* the radio - loudness parameter is thought to be a good indicator of source orientation and therefore its low values , log@xmath51 may imply large viewing angles . since",
    ", the ai quasars have on average larger values of log@xmath0 , the orientation can mean that we see them less absorbed .",
    "* orientation is an important but not the only one parameter that determines our ability to detect absorption lines .",
    "we suggest also that the radio evolution itself is not directly connected with bal phenomenon but is rather superimposed on the radio - loud balqso population .",
