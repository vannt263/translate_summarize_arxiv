    "massive stars provide much of the energy input in the universe .",
    "their high mass - loss rates and supernova explosions provide important feedback to the star formation processes and total energy input of galaxies .",
    "recent advances in stellar modelling ( e.g. , groh et al .",
    "2013 ) show that the supernova progenitors for core collapse supernovae come in many different types that include red supergiants ( rsg ) , blue supergiants ( bsg ) , wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , and luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) .",
    "massive stars tend to be found primarily in binary systems .",
    "the o stars are thought to have a bound companion about 75% of the time , with most of the exceptions being runaway stars ( e.g. mason et al .",
    "mason et al .  found that o stars in clusters and associations have companions at least 60 - 80% of the time .",
    "their sample focused on high angular resolution techniques , but also incorporated spectroscopic results .",
    "sana et al .",
    "( 2012 ) showed that 71% of o stars will have a binary interaction during their lives .",
    "they found that only 29% of the o stars are effectively single ( either very - long period binary stars or actually single ) , meaning that evolutionary models that do not incorporate binary effects will have limited applicability .",
    "lbvs are among the most unusual classes of massive stars .",
    "they have attained a highly luminous , unstable state that shows remarkable mass - loss and variability .",
    "the normal mass - loss rates range between @xmath4 m@xmath5 yr@xmath6 , which has typically led to the conclusion that these objects are post - main sequence , hydrogen - shell - burning massive stars that represent the transitionary phase between the main sequence o stars and the helium - burning wr stars ( e.g.  humphreys & davidson 1994 ; van genderen 2001 ) . however , the recent analysis by groh et al .",
    "( 2013 ) shows that lower initial mass stars ( 2025 @xmath7 ) can become lbvs after the rsg phase , and then explode as type ii supernovae during the final lbv phase .    with a large binary fraction for the main - sequence o stars , one may also expect to see a high binary fraction in the post - main sequence massive stars .",
    "however , the binary fraction for wr stars is low ( 40% ) as noted by vanbeveren & conti ( 1980 ) .",
    "an examination of the multiplicity and binarity of lbvs was reported by martayan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) who reported a remarkably low binary fraction of only 11% .",
    "there are only four well - studied lbv binary systems : @xmath8 carinae ( e.g.  richardson et al .",
    "2010 , madura et al .",
    "2013 and references therein ) , mwc 314 ( lobel et al .  2013 , hereafter l13 ) ,",
    "hd 5980 ( e.g.  koenigsberger et al .",
    "2010 ) , and r 81 ( hde 269128 ; tubbesing et al .",
    "@xmath8 car is by far the most studied of all these binary systems , but analyses of both @xmath8 car and the other systems have not produced reliable , model - independent masses yet .",
    "for example , in the r 81 system , a clear eclipse is seen in the light curve while the primary is in front of the secondary in our line of sight , but the secondary eclipse is small , and similar in amplitude to the pulsations in the system .",
    "the masses of both stars are only known to a factor of @xmath9 , which does not provide much insight into the masses of these evolved massive stars ( tubbesing et al .",
    "hd 5980 shows orbital variations due to both colliding winds and binarity , and the system shows long - term evolution in its light curve similar to that of other lbvs ( koenigsberger et al .",
    "2010 ) , but the spectrum reveals that the two stars both appear as wnh stars ( wolf - rayet stars showing nitrogen - enrichment and hydrogen ) .",
    "this makes the temperature of hd 5980 hotter than all other lbvs so a determination of its mass may not be typical of lbvs .",
    "mwc 314 is unique in that the orbital period is semi - short ( 60.8 d ) , it is well - placed in the sky ( @xmath10 ) , and bright enough to allow high resolution studies of the star and its environs with multiple observing techniques .",
    "mwc 314 ( bd+14 3887 , v1429 aql , hen 3 - 1745 ) has been examined in a few key studies , which were largely reviewed in the recent work of l13 .",
    "miroshnichenko ( 1996 ) found the star to be of high luminosity , exhibit a strong interstellar reddening , and to have a similar luminosity to the prototypical lbv , p cygni .",
    "miroshnichenko et al .",
    "( 1998 ) then determined the spectral characteristics and found it to be very similar to p cygni , with an estimated distance of @xmath11 kpc .",
    "wisniewski et al .",
    "( 2006 ) presented a long - term spectropolarimetric and spectroscopic study of mwc 314 , finding the first evidence of h@xmath12 variability .",
    "they found that the polarisation was variable in a way reminiscent of an asymmetric wind .",
    "mwc 314 was shown to be a spectroscopic binary by muratorio et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , but they underestimated the orbital period .",
    "l13 measured absorption lines of s ii and ne i , which are thought to be photospheric , and found the system to have a 60.8 d orbit with a small eccentricity of @xmath13 .",
    "they also demonstrated that the @xmath14band photometry from the all sky automated survey is modulated on the orbital time scale , and their interpretation of the light curve includes two partial eclipses .",
    "l13  used a model of the single - lined spectroscopic radial velocity orbit and photometric light curve to help estimate the mass ratio and system parameters .",
    "they found that the primary star had typical parameters for an lbv , with @xmath15k , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the secondary star s parameters were very unusual in that they suggest the companion is a yellow giant .",
    "this interpretation is inconsistent from an evolutionary standpoint because the secondary should not be able to reach an advanced evolutionary state ( cool temperature ) given the short lifetime of the evolved primary star .",
    "liermann et al .",
    "( 2014 ) present nir @xmath19band spectrophotometry of mwc 314 and some b[e ] stars .",
    "several of these stars show co spectral features that would be consistent with a companion similar to that suggested by l13 , but mwc 314 does not show these features .",
    "l13  also developed a three - dimensional wind model to create synthetic he i wind lines for comparative purposes showing some evidence for an asymmetric wind , which was further developed by lobel et al .",
    "this asymmetric wind has a density enhancement on the leading hemisphere of the lbv that feeds gas into a circumbinary disc .",
    "further , they obtained an image of the h@xmath12 emission nebula surrounding the star which shows a bipolar structure on large scales ( marston & mccollum  2008 ) , but appears spherically symmetric at small scales of a few arcseconds .    in this paper , we present a variety of new observations ( spectroscopy , photometry , and long - baseline near - infrared interferometry ) of the mwc 314 system , which is described in section 2 . in section 3 , a revised single - lined orbit based upon new spectroscopy and",
    "the work of l13 is presented and discussed .",
    "section 4 discusses the orbital light - curve , as well as the discovery of pulsational modes .",
    "our interferometric results are presented in section 5 . in section 6 ,",
    "we present a general discussion of the system with respect to the fundamental parameters , pulsations , and the interferometric results .",
    "we conclude our study in section 7 .",
    "we observed mwc 314 with a variety of telescopes and instruments with the primary goal being to better constrain the single - lined orbit .",
    "the telescopes used include the ctio 1.5 m operated by the smarts consortium , the observatoire du mont mgantic 1.6 m , mcdonald observatory s struve 2.1 m and harlan smith 2.7 m , the mercator 1.2 m , and the san pedro martir 2.1 m telescopes .",
    "all observations were reduced using standard techniques for long - slit or echelle spectroscopy utilising bias frames and flat fields with either iraf or custom software .",
    "wavelength calibration was accomplished through emission - line comparison spectra taken before or after each observation .",
    "a spectroscopic observing log is presented in table a1 that details the telescopes , spectrographs , and data .",
    "l13 measured the absorption lines s ii @xmath20 and ne i @xmath21 , due to their lack of blending with the large number of emission lines in the spectrum of mwc 314 .",
    "we sought to include these lines whenever possible .",
    "radial velocity measurements were made through gaussian fits of the spectral lines .",
    "we found that we were able to use the ne i @xmath21 line for all data sets , but the s ii lines often suffered from lower s / n and were unreliable .",
    "the mcdonald observatory observations provided excellent data for s ii @xmath22 , but were not usable for the s ii @xmath23 lines . the data from the ctio 1.5 smarts fiber - fed bench - mounted echelleatokovin / echelle / fech - overview.html ] ( barden & ingerson 1998 ) were only usable around the ne i line",
    "however , the data obtained with the ctio 1.5 m and the chiron spectrograph ( tokovinin et al .",
    "2013 ) have higher s / n across the optical spectrum .",
    "the spectroscopic data discussed in l13 were obtained with the mercator 1.2 m telescope and the hermes spectrograph ( raskin et al .",
    "2011 ) , which we also used to obtain three additional spectra of comparable quality .",
    "the spectrum taken at san pedro martir was extremely useful due to the orbital phase observed ( most negative radial velocity ) and good s / n .",
    "the data from the observatoire du mont mgantic ( omm ) were of much lower spectral resolution , and we only obtained two spectra that had high enough s / n to measure accurately a radial velocity from the weak absorption lines .",
    "broadband @xmath24 photometry was obtained throughout the 20102012 calendar years with the american association of variable star observers automated telescope located at lowell observatory .",
    "the telescope is a celestron c11 schmidt - cassegrain instrument with an aperture of 28 cm .",
    "imaging was accomplished with an sbig st-7xme camera , which yields images with a field of view of 14@xmath259 arcmin .",
    "the reductions utilise dark , bias , and flat frames , and typically the scattered light background leads to a photometric accuracy of 12% .",
    "the differential photometry was done relative to another star in the field , hd 231237 , which shows a constant light curve in the all sky automated survey ( asas ; pojmaski 2002 ) and was classified as g5 by cannon ( 1925 ) .",
    "we wished to obtain a reasonable magnitude estimate of mwc 314 relative to the comparison star , so magnitudes for the comparison star were obtained from the aavso photometric all - sky survey ( apass ) , which measured @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 for hd 231237 .",
    "the johnson @xmath31 magnitude was obtained by using the relations given by kent ( 1985 ) , which gave @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , we transformed these data into johnson @xmath33 using the transformations given by windhorst et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , which yields @xmath34 .",
    "we present the measurements of mwc 314 calibrated by hd 231237 in table a4 .",
    "however , we caution that we did not perform any colour transformations on the data , so the magnitudes may have small systematic errors related to airmass at the time of observation .",
    "we observed the system with the micro - satellite _ most_(_microvariability and oscillations of stars _ ) which has a 15-cm maksutov telescope with a custom broad - band filter covering 35007500  .",
    "the sun - synchronous polar orbit has a period of 101.4 minutes ( @xmath35 ) , which enables uninterrupted observations for up to eight weeks for targets in the continuous viewing zone .",
    "a pre - launch summary of the mission is given by walker et al .",
    "the satellite was never intended to observe a target for several months and recover time - scales on the order of the length of the data .",
    "mwc 314 was observed for a small portion of every spacecraft orbit for 55 d , spanning 2014 june 19 to 2014 august 15 in the direct imaging mode .",
    "our data were taken over short orbital segments , which we then averaged during each 510 minute interval to have precise photometry from the orbital means .",
    "the photometry was extracted using the standard _ most_pipeline ( walker et al .",
    "2003 ) , and we show two different versions of the final light - curve in this paper , which are given in tables a6 and a7 .",
    "the first uses a trend - removed data that removes the binary - induced signal from the light curve .",
    "we also attempted to extract the binary light curve by using a raw extraction that allowed for the signal to remain .",
    "it was difficult to recover the binary signal , as a remaining instrumental response needed to be removed through a comparison with all guide stars that were observed simultaneously , and then fitting and removing an average  instrumental \" trend from the data .",
    "we note that a small portion of this light curve could not be corrected for the instrumental response . the long time - series from _ most_was not continuous due to data gaps induced from passages through the south atlantic anomaly , problems with scattered light that is more prominent during northern summer months , and communications errors .",
    "nevertheless , the _ most _ observations provide a unique photometric data set to explore the variability of this object .",
    "we obtained multiple epochs of long baseline near - infrared interferometry using the chara array and the classic ( ten brummelaar et al .",
    "2005 ) and climb beam combiners ( ten brummelaar et al .",
    "2013 ) in the @xmath36band during the calendar years 20102013 .",
    "the chara array is a @xmath37-shaped interferometric array of six 1-m telescopes with baselines ranging from 34 to 331 meters in length .",
    "our observations were primarily at longer baselines , but we obtained a few measurements with short baselines .",
    "the nights of observations , baselines used , and calibrators for each observation are listed in table a2 .    to measure the instrument response and calibrate our data , we observed calibrator stars with small angular diameters both before and after each observation of mwc 314 .",
    "namely , we observed the calibrator stars hd 174897 ( @xmath38 mas ; boyajian et al .",
    "2012 ) , hd 182101 ( @xmath39 mas ; berger et al .",
    "2006 , baines et al .",
    "2010 ) , and hd 184606 ( @xmath40 mas ; van belle et al .",
    "these calibrators have diameters known from fits to the spectral energy distribution and have all been reliable for previous interferometric studies .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard chara reduction pipeline ( ten brummelaar et al .",
    "2005 , 2013 ) .",
    "the visibilities and closure phases were averaged over each observing block .",
    "the calibrated oifits data files ( pauls et al . 2005 ) will be available through the jmmc archive or upon request , but we also include tabulated visibilities in table a5 .",
    "schaefer et al .  ( 2014 ) describe the effects of emission lines on the errors and measurements of @xmath41 .",
    "an emission line reduces the effective bandpass over which the fringe amplitude is measured causing the true visibility to be smaller than if a fixed bandpass was assumed .",
    "we measured the effective bandpass through comparisons of the width of the power spectra of both calibrator stars and mwc 314 , and found that this is typically an effect of @xmath42 much smaller than the typical error of our measurements .",
    "further , we compared a @xmath36band filter response with a single nir spectrum of mwc 314 we obtained with the mimir instrument and the lowell observatory 1.8 m telescope ( clemens et al .",
    "this spectrum was reduced with the standard mimir pipline and flux - calibrated and telluric - corrected using the xtellcor package ( vacca et al .",
    "this spectrum was then convolved with the filter response , and we found that the effective width was within 1 - 2% of the nominal width .",
    "these values show that there was little change in the visibilities , but the resulting uncertainty in the width of the filter ( @xmath43 ) was added in quadrature to the pipeline - produced error .",
    "the optical spectrum of mwc 314 consists of four different kinds of spectral lines , which are illustrated in the spectral atlas of miroshnichenko et al .",
    "first , there are absorption lines , such as those measured by l13 .",
    "these are thought to be photospheric in origin , with minimal contamination by the wind .",
    "these lines are similar to the photospheric metal lines observed in the b7 ia supergiant hd 183143 ( chentsov et al .",
    "2003 ) , but are typical of any early- or mid - b supergiant . secondly , the wind of the system is best seen in the strong balmer lines and he i emission lines .",
    "the balmer lines do not show a p cygni absorption component , but the he i lines have p cygni absorption that shows orbitally - modulated variability where the absorption strengthens at certain orbital epochs ( l13 ) .",
    "thirdly , there are many lines of singly - ionised metals , such as fe ii , that show double - peaked emission profiles",
    ". these lines were shown by l13 to be constant in radial velocity and are thought to originate from a circumbinary disc . in reality , some of the double - peaked emission lines and balmer lines are likely formed in a combination of the circumbinary disc and stellar wind .",
    "the fourth and final type of lines are the interstellar absorption lines .",
    "these lines are very complicated , often showing several absorption components due to the extreme extinction of mwc 314 ( @xmath44 ; miroshnichenko 1996 ) .",
    "we measured radial velocities through gaussian fits of the same absorption lines as measured by l13 to refine the spectroscopic orbit of mwc 314 .",
    "the lines used were discussed in section 2.1 , and the new radial velocities are presented in table a3 .",
    "we estimate the errors on most of the data points to be on the order of @xmath45 km s@xmath6 , and a little better ( @xmath46 km s@xmath6 ) for the hermes spectra .",
    "the data are shown in figure 1 with our orbital elements presented in table 1 .",
    "the data span the calendar years 20012013 , so we derived the orbital period through a time - series analysis of these new radial velocities combined with the velocities reported by both muratorio et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and l13 .",
    "we confirm the orbital period , although we adopt a more conservative error than reported by l13 .",
    "note that l13  set phase zero at inferior conjunction of the visible star and also measure @xmath47 from this epoch , instead of the standard spectroscopic method of setting @xmath47 equal to the angle between the ascending node and periastron .",
    "the values of @xmath48 and @xmath47 given in table 1 for the l13 solution are referenced to periastron in the standard way .",
    "the errors reported by l13  are generally smaller than ours , however , the phoebe code they used does not directly estimate the errors of the parameters , so we suspect that these are underestimated .",
    "we show orbital parameters in table 1 for l13 s fit , our fit to their data showing more realistic errors , an independent fit to only our new data , and a combined fit to all data available from muratorio et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , l13 , and our new data .",
    "all the solutions are comparable , and we adopt the combined fit for the remainder of this analysis .     the revised single - lined spectroscopic orbit with data sources marked .",
    "phase 0 indicates the periastron passage .",
    "new data are shown as solid points , the open circles are from l13 , and the open diamonds are from muratorio et al .",
