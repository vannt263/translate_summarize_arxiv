    "the viscous hydrodynamic equation provides us with a unified way to describe the near - equilibrium systems in terms of macroscopic quantities such as the pressure , particle number density , and fluid velocity .",
    "the detailed microscopic properties of the system are renormalized into transport coefficients such as the shear viscosity , heat conductivity and so on . therefore , the elaborate investigation of the transport coefficients is one of the most important tasks to reveal the microscopic properties of the fluid .",
    "for instance , the fluid with a tiny shear viscosity is realized in the experiment of ultracold fermi gases at unitarity @xcite : the value of its shear viscosity is close to a quantum bound that is theoretically proposed @xcite , implying the realization of the strongly correlated systems at the unitarity @xcite .",
    "since the naive hydrodynamic description , however , breaks down when the mean free path is not small enough compared with the macroscopic length scale , we should incorporate more microscopic properties such as the relaxation process of dissipative currents , which is characterized by viscous relaxation times @xcite .",
    "dynamical equation taking into account them may be called _ mesoscopic _",
    "@xcite since it describes the dynamics in an intermediate scale between those described by the navier - stokes and the boltzmann equations .",
    "the second - order hydrodynamic equation describes the mesoscopic dynamics including the relaxation of the dissipative currents , in addition to the ordinary hydrodynamic behavior described by the navier - stokes equation .",
    "in particular , the quantitative estimates of the viscous relaxation times are crucial to predict beyond - navier - stokes behavior of fluids in the mesoscopic regime , and such a behavior should be realized in the dilute cold atomic gases , for instance .",
    "indeed the importance of the second - order hydrodynamics has been recognized and many attempts have been done to derive it @xcite , and among them the renormalization group ( rg ) method seems to be a promising method to derive the second - order hydrodynamics as well as the transport coefficients including the viscous relaxation times .",
    "in fact , it has been applied to derive the second - order hydrodynamic equations from the boltzmann equation for both relativistic and non - relativistic systems @xcite , and desirable properties have been already proved for the resultant equation such as causality , stability , positivity of the entropy production rate , and the onsager s reciprocal relation without imposing any assumption a priori @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is worth emphasizing that the microscopic expressions obtained for the transport coefficients such as the shear viscosity , heat conductivity and so on coincide with those derived in the celebrated chapman - enskog method , while the novel microscopic expressions of the viscous relaxation times written in terms of the relaxation functions allow physically natural interpretations as the relaxation times .",
    "the aim of this article is to give basic analyses of nonequilibrium properties of cold atomic gasses in a quantitative way based on the kinetic theory @xcite ; a focus is put on a quantitative and comprehensive analysis of the viscous relaxation times based on the novel microscopic formulas of them @xcite .",
    "such an analysis is of fundamental importance in this field because the quantitative extraction of the relaxation times is indispensable to elucidate the dynamics of cold atomic gases in a precise way . in focusing nonequilibrium properties",
    ", we shall not take care of the pairing correlations including the superfluid transition nor medium effects , which are extensively discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . instead ,",
    "we perform a quantitative test of the shear viscosity , heat conductivity , and viscous relaxation times of the stress tensor and heat flow using the microscopic expressions obtained in rg method applied boltzmann equation , and examine the temperature and scattering - length dependence and quantum statistical effects : the evaluation of these quantities are converted to solving the corresponding linear integral equations , which we solve numerically without recourse to any approximation . on the basis of the numerical results ,",
    "we also examine how well the relation @xmath0 and its analog for the heat conductivity @xcite are satisfied , where @xmath2 is the viscous relaxation time of the stress tensor , @xmath3 is the shear viscosity , and @xmath4 is the pressure .",
    "these relations are obtained from the boltzmann equation with use of the relaxation - time approximation ( rta ) , which has been widely applied to a lot of studies of the kinetic theory .",
    "quantitative reliability of the rta is unclear and has been hardly checked : we are only aware of @xcite in which the validity of the rta is analytically examined up to some approximations .",
    "the present analyses confirm that the quantum statistical effect significantly contribute to the transport coefficients at low temperature and near unitarity .",
    "furthermore , we find that the relation @xmath0 is well satisfied quantitatively , while the analogous relation for the viscous relaxation time of the heat conductivity @xmath1 is not satisfied well .",
    "the rg method is a general framework to identify slow variables and extract their dynamics from original theories @xcite . in the rg method ,",

    "two remarks are in order here : first , eqs .   and are consistent with the green - kubo formula @xcite .",
    "they actually take the same form as those of the chapman - enskog method . secondly , the forms of eqs .   and give the time constant of the correlation function of the microscopic dissipative currents , which are physically natural forms as viscous relaxation times .",
    "aiming at the application to the ultracold fermi gases realized in the cold - atom experiments , we examine the shear viscosity , heat conductivity , and the viscous relaxation times of the stress tensor and heat flow derived above .",
    "we consider the s - wave scattering in the collision integral .",
    "then , the scattering amplitude in eq .   is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the s - wave scattering length and @xmath47 is the incoming relative momentum .",
    "in the present analyses based on eq .  , the transport coefficients become even functions of @xmath46 , though they may loose such a symmetry if the medium effects are taken into account @xcite ; the asymmetric behavior can be caused by the existence of a bosonic regime of preformed pairs for positive @xmath46 , which is neglected in the present study and the incorporation of such an effect is beyond the scope of this work .",

    "the unitary limit is taken by @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the fermi momentum . for the classical boltzmann gas , we set @xmath12 in eq .",
    "and the corresponding equilibrium distribution function reads @xmath56 . for the fermi gas ,",
    "we take into account the quantum statistics by setting @xmath57 , and the equilibrium distribution function is @xmath58^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the resultant data show that , as the scattering length increases , the viscous effects decrease ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a_1st_cf ] ) , and the quantum statistical effects increase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_q ] ) .",
    "the scattering - length dependence of the quantum statistical effects indicates that the quantum nature becomes apparent at unitarity , where the atomic gases are strongly correlated .",
    "figure  [ fig : t_1st ] shows the temperature dependence of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the quantum statistical effect increases @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the difference between the classical gas and the fermi gas becomes larger as temperature decreases .",
    "in particular , at the temperature @xmath61 , the differences become prominent and those of the fermi gas diverge .",
    "two comments are in order here .",
    "( i )  the quantum statistical effect is not negligible even above @xmath62 , below which pairing effects dominate and our computation becomes invalid .",
    "( ii )  the increases of the shear viscosity and heat conductivity for the fermi gas at small temperature are naturally understood in terms of the pauli blocking effect ; a good fermi sphere is formed at low temperature and thus the elastic scattering rate other than the forward one is so greatly suppressed due to the pauli blocking that the energy and momentum transport become quite efficient , which implies the increase of the shear viscosity and heat conductivity .",
    "the viscous relaxation times exhibit similar behaviors as the transport coefficients .",
    "the quantum statistical effects increases at low temperature and near unitarity ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : ratio_q ] and [ fig : t_tau ] ) .",
    "it seems that a misunderstanding prevails in the literature on the basis of the classical boltzmann equation that the shear viscosity calculated in the naive kinetic theory were to agree with the experimental results at low temperature even close to @xmath62 .",
    "our results , however , have shown that the quantum statistical corrections are huge and the resultant shear viscosity shows a rapid increase with lowering temperature which is obviously in contradiction to the experimental results .",
    "thus we conclude that the naive kinetic approach is not valid for the description of the unitary fermi gas at low temperature , where the system becomes strongly correlated , even above the phase transition temperature .         and @xmath62 , respectively.,width=245 ]     and @xmath62 , respectively.,width=245 ]",
    "in the rta , the collision integral in eq .   is replaced by @xmath63_p = -\\frac{f_p - f^\\mathrm{eq}_p}{\\tau},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is a free parameter which determines the time scale for a non - equilibrium system to relax toward the equilibrium states . under the approximation ,",
    "the shear viscosity and heat conductivity are calculated to be @xcite @xmath65 with the definition @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that the viscous relaxation times are given by @xmath64 , @xmath67    however , the viscous relaxation times of the stress tensor and heat conductivity given by eq .",
    "take the considerably different values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a_tau ] and [ fig : t_tau ] ) .",
    "these results are interesting on its own , and also clearly contradict to eq .   and indicate that the rta should be modified so as to incorporate the multiple relaxation - time scales . to this end , we determine the viscous relaxation times independently with the help of the relations eq .",
    "derived from the rta and exact value of the shear viscosity and heat conductivity as follows : we evaluate the viscous relaxation time of the stress tensor by @xmath68 while the viscous relaxation time of the heat conductivity is evaluated as @xmath69 we note that @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 denote the transport coefficients and viscous relaxation times which are respectively calculated from eqs .   and in the exact manner in the present work . in figs .  [",
    "fig : a_tau ] and [ fig : t_tau ] , we compare the viscous relaxation times with and without the rta and the numerical results of eqs .   and actually behave similarly compared with the exact ones qualitatively .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath74 well reproduces the viscous relaxation time of the stress tensor @xmath75 for both the classical gas and the fermi gas regardless of temperature and scattering length . on the other hand",
    ", the rta still has the quantitative error and always underestimates the viscous relaxation time of the heat conductivity compared with those evaluated exactly .",
    "it is noteworthy that the error of @xmath1 caused by the rta for the fermi gas decreases at low temperature in contrast to that for classical gas , which is independent of temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_rta ] ) . this behavior may be understood as follows : the rta is a kind of the linear approximation of the collision integral with respect to the deviation of the distribution function from the equilibrium one .",
    "the deviation is attributed to the excitations of quasi - particles due to the nonequilibrium process and decreases in the cold fermionic gases since the pauli - blocking effect suppresses the excitation of the quasi - particles inside the fermi sphere .",
    "therefore the linear approximation works well and the rta reproduces the exact value of the viscous relaxation time of the heat conductivity .",
    "we have calculated in a full numerical way the shear viscosity , heat conductivity and viscous relaxation times of the stress tensor and heat flow using the microscopic expressions which are derived by the rg method .",
    "it is notable that the shear viscosity and heat conductivity by the rg method have the same expression as those by the chapman - enskog method , and the viscous relaxation times take new but natural forms .",
    "any approximation has not been used in the numerical evaluation of these quantities in the present work , which has given the exact values based on the boltzmann equation .",
    "we have found that the fermi statistics makes significant contributions to the transport coefficients and viscous relaxation times at low temperature or large scattering length .",
    "furthermore , by using the numerical results we have for the first time examined the reliability of the relations @xmath0 and @xmath76 , which are derived with recourse to the rta and used rather extensively .",
    "the resulting data have shown that the ratio of the shear viscosity and pressure well agrees with the viscous relaxation time .",
    "this agreement is consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite and suggests the reliability of the rg method .",
    "furthermore , the results encourage us to use the relation @xmath0 , which greatly simplifies the evaluation of the viscous relaxation time of the stress tensor . on the other hand",
    ", the latter relation for the viscous relaxation time does not appear to be reliable .",
    "thus , we should use the value evaluated by eq .   instead of eq .   for the viscous relaxation time of the heat conductivity",
    "the detailed analyses of this work will be reported in ref .",
    "investigation of the time - evolution of fluids with these transport coefficients is needed to examine quantitative significance of the difference of @xmath1 evaluated with and without the rta , and it is left as a future project .",
