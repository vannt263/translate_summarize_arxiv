    "interest in x - ray emission in starburst galaxies ( sbgs ) stems from their diverse radiative activity which is powered by an abundant population of massive , young stars .",
    "the enhanced star formation rate in these gas and dust rich galaxies leads to intense far - infrared ( fir ) radiation from warm interstellar dust heated by the massive stars .",
    "the large number of x - ray binaries and supernova ( sn ) remnants , as well as hot winds driven by sn shocks , imply that x - ray emission from a sbg is more intense than from a normal spiral ( bookbinder 1980 ) .",
    "moreover , since sn remnants are prime sites for shock - acceleration of particles to high energies , compton scattering of relativistic electrons by the local radiation fields will enhance x - ray emission in a sbg .",
    "this expectation is heightened by the fact that in a sbg the energy density of the fir radiation field can be much higher than that of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( schaaf 1989 , rephaeli 1991 ) .",
    "the sb phase may occur in various types of galaxies ( triggered , perhaps , by galactic mergers ) . as in other active galaxies",
    ", a sbg may also have an active , compact nucleus , and one of the primary issues in the study of sbgs is the possible connection between low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and sb activities . since both phenomena may occur in at least some active galaxies , it is important to determine some of their observational manifestations in order to better characterize sbgs .",
    "this obviously is a prerequisite in the assessment of the significance of the sb phase in galactic evolution , and its cosmological ramifications , such as the enrichment of the intergalactic medium by metal - rich gas ejected during the sb phase , and the contributions of sbgs to the x - ray background ( rephaeli 1995 ) .",
    "high energy phenomena are triggered by the massive star formation activity , and because of the obscuration of optical emission and considerable re - processing of ir emission , x - rays allow a more direct and penetrating view of the inner regions of sbgs .",
    "detailed x - ray spatial and spectral information is very valuable for determining the basic properties of sbgs .",
    "however , considerable knowledge on the emission mechanisms and environments may be gained from good quality spectral data alone , particularly so if these include temporal information .",
    "m82 and ngc 253 are the closest sbgs .",
    "these ` archetypical ' sbgs have been observed with all the major x - ray satellites ( e.g. , fabbiano 1988a , tsuru 1990 , ohashi 1990 , boller 1992 , matsumoto & tsuru 1999 , cappi 1999 , pietsch 2001 ) .",
    "their x - ray emission is quite substantial , in the range @xmath6 erg / s ; reported best - fit spectra include both thermal ( cappi 1999 ) and power - law forms ( e.g. weaver 2000 ) .",
    "both galaxies have already been observed also with _",
    "( strickland 2000 , matsumoto 2001 , kaaret 2001 ) . at low x - ray energies ,",
    "emission from these galaxies extends well beyond their optical disks , so the sb activity is not manifested only in the central nuclear sb region ( @xmath7 kpc ) .",
    "however , even in these nearby galaxies the characteristics of the emission have not yet been determined in much detail .",
    "it is important to determine the relative contributions of the sb - powered versus nuclear - powered emission , and the respective significance of thermal and nonthermal processes .    to better establish the x - ray properties of m82 and ngc 253",
    ", we have initiated observations with the proportional counter array ( pca ) and the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) aboard the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) satellite .",
    "our main motivation has been to use the good temporal and wide - energy capabilities of the rxte in order to assess the possible role of an agn - like variable emission , and the level of contribution of compton scattering to the integrated emission in sbgs . these rxte observations and the results of the spectral and temporal analysis",
    "are reported here .",
    "the rxte was inserted into low earth orbit on 1995 dec 31 .",
    "the pca was described by jahoda ( 1996 ) and the hexte by rothschild ( 1998 ) .",
    "the pca has energy resolution of 16% at 6 kev and a useful energy range of 2.5 kev to about 25 kev , limited at the high end by uncertainties of determining the internal background .",
    "the hexte has resolution of 15% at 60 kev and an energy range from 15 to 250 kev .",
    "for the present observations the errors of background determination with hexte were negligible .",
    "for both instruments calibration of energy response has been extensive and is accurate to better than 2% .",
    "the instrumental time resolution of microseconds was not needed , but the very flexible rxte scheduling of observations was exploited to permit sampling on all time scales from one orbit ( 90 minutes ) to ten months . both the pca and hexte are non - imaging with field - of - view ( fov ) one degree .    over the period february - november 1997 ,",
    "thirty one - orbit observations each were made of m82 and ngc 253 . to sample possible variability as well as temporal changes through the entire campaign , a somewhat intricate plan ( table 1 )",
    "was devised consisting of four observing sequences .",
    "eight of the orbits were spaced over one day , seven orbits over one week , another seven over eight weeks , and the remaining eight over 42 weeks .",
    "the spacing of observations in each sequence was not uniform but moderately irregular : each sequence was divided into 15 equal segments , and observations were placed in either seven or eight of these segments in patterns based on the cyclic difference set of size 15 ( baumert 1971 ) .",
    "such patterns allow uniform sensitivity to variability on a somewhat broader range of time scales or frequencies than with evenly spaced samples . with the two longest sequences the corresponding m82 and ngc 253 observations occurred within a day of each other .",
    "three pca detectors were employed for all observations .",
    "analysis of m82 was complicated by variability and by the presence of another known source with appreciable x - ray emission , m81 , in the fov .",
    "the separation of m81 by @xmath8 from m82 resulted in a transmission of about 38% for m81 in the rxte fields .",
    "although the rxte field rotated considerably during the 10-month campaign , the pca fov , nominally a hexagonal pyramid , is sufficiently conical that the area presented to m81 varied by not more than 10% .",
    "we have also analyzed contemporaneous archival asca and rosat data to provide limits to the m81 contribution .",
    ".observation sequences [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the best - fit thermal forms for the late extra emission have temperatures that are modestly but significantly lower than for the earlier emission .",
    "if the entire data set samples a single source and process , then this process must generate somewhat softer spectra at higher emission levels .",
    "we note that whether the extra emission is assumed to have a thermal or a power law form , the addition of an absorbing column results in a significant improvement in @xmath9 , dramatically so for the power law form .",
    "the appearance of an extra column with increased flux levels may not be unphysical even if the high and low levels result from a single process , but it is simpler to interpret the need for absorption as an indication of an obscured source .",
    "thus , based on this spectral analysis it would appear that the origin of the extra late emission is in a source , most likely a single source , which did not emit the earlier lower flux .",
    "a similar high - low analysis has been performed by matsumoto & tsuru ( 1999 ) and by ptak & griffiths ( 1999 ) , both using essentially the same asca data collected from 1993 to 1996 .",
    "matsumoto & tsuru give the more useful summary of spectral fitting of the high - low flux : a thermal form with best - fit @xmath10 kev , fits slightly better than a power law with best - fit number index 1.8 .",
    "both forms require strong absorption with column near @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "these rxte results , with much better high energy sensitivity , strongly favor a thermal form over power law , but the best fit values for column and kt , @xmath13 and 4.7 kev , respectively , each differ from the corresponding asca value by a factor of two .",
    "differences of this scale probably can not be dismissed as intercalibration errors : asca and rxte saw something rather different . if the same single source was seen , it varies on the scale of roughly a year in both column and general spectral shape .",
    "much of the absorbing column must lie near to the source .",
    "given the varied nature of x - ray emitting environments in sbgs , significant thermal emission is clearly expected from the relatively high abundance of various stellar sources such as x - ray binaries , hot gas in snrs , and sn - driven winds in the is space and inner halo . the main issues that can be addressed based directly on our spectral analysis have been briefly discussed in the previous section . here",
    "we elaborate further on the implications of these results .",
    "a detailed comparison between the results of the rxte and bepposax observation is complicated , given that the pca has a larger fov than that of the mecs experiment . also , no temporal comparison is possible because the observations were made over non - overlapping periods , and due to the fact that bepposax observed m82 over only two days .",
    "it is nonetheless of considerable interest that bepposax measurements do show some flux variability in the central region of m82 .",
    "this is a clear indication that at least part of the variability seen in the pca data is intrinsic to m82 , and is not fully attributable to the variable ( seyfert 1 ) galaxy m81 , which is in the fov of the pca but not in that of the mecs .",
    "some , seemingly periodic , variability of the m81 emission on a timescale of up to @xmath1 days , has been seen recently by bepposax ( pellegrini 2000 ) .",
    "if this is characteristic of m81 , then it is clear that the stronger variability detected by the rxte over a longer timescale has a different origin",
    ". we also note  from this general comparative point of view  that there is no indication of a second , low - temperature component in the rxte data , whose lower threshold energy at @xmath14 kev makes rxte insensitive to it .",
    "an important result of our analysis is the large secular variation in the flux of m82 during the last four observation segments in july 1997 .",
    "such a large temporal change of galactic - scale emission is commonly attributed to the characteristics of the accretion process onto a massive black hole .",
    "these include also power law noise spectra which have been observed for several agn sources ( edelson & nandra 1999 ) with spectral indices of 1.5  1.7 , only mildly inconsistent with the present case of 1.0 @xmath15 0.4 .",
    "the variable emission would then be expected to have an agn - like power law energy spectrum with very significant photoelectric absorption . indeed , our spectral analysis yields evidence for the presence of such a component in the variable emission from m82 .",
    "the deduced values of @xmath16 are rather high , @xmath17 @xmath12 ( about an order of magnitude higher than column densities in seyfert i galaxies such as m81 ) , perhaps indicative of a seyfert ii nucleus ( risaliti 1999 ) .",
    "however , the best - fit power law index , @xmath18 , is much higher than the more typical value of @xmath19 .",
    "the thermal fit of the residual emission with the high absorption yields a very low iron abundance , perhaps too low to be acceptable .",
    "alternatively , the flux increase in july 1997 may possibly be due to variable emission from an x - ray binary system .",
    "if in m82 , the high level of emission ( @xmath20 erg - s@xmath21 in the 2 - 10 kev band ) would make this unusually luminous when compared with the more common luminosity range ( @xmath22 erg - s@xmath21 ) of binaries .",
    "although rare , a few such x - ray luminous binaries are known ( in the spiral galaxies ngc3628 and ngc4631 - fabbiano 1988b ) .",
    "the spectral shapes of these sources are usually fit with power - law indices @xmath23 , or @xmath24 values of a few kev . arguing against a binary origin for the extra emission is the very low upper limit of 15 ev for the equivalent width of an fe k@xmath25 line .",
    "the 320 ev equivalent width of hercules x-1 fe k@xmath25 line ( gruber 2001 ) reasonably typical of galactic accreting binaries , is a factor @xmath26 higher .",
    "> from asca monitoring in 1993 and 1999 it was concluded ( matsumoto & tsuru 1999 , ptak & griffiths 1999 ) that the m82 flux varied by a factor @xmath27 over this period .",
    "they argue that the varying emission originates from within a central 10  region , and that if due to accretion onto a massive black hole , the implied mass is @xmath28 . a compact source in the nucleus with the deduced level of luminosity , @xmath29 erg / s in the 2 - 10 kev band ( based on a distance of 3.6 mpc ) , would imply that m82 is a low luminosity agn . however , we consider the identification of the source of flux variability with an agn in m82 to be insecure",
    ". continued monitoring of the central emission in m82 is needed in order to better establish its temporal , spectral , and spatial properties .",
    "more recently , high - resolution observations of the central 1 region of m82 with the _ chandra _ satellite revealed 4 sources whose flux exhibits significant temporal variability ( matsumoto 2001 , kaaret 2001 ) . in particular , the 0.510 kev flux of one of these sources ( cxom82 j095550.2 + 694047 ) varied by a factor of @xmath30 ( during the period october 1999  january 2000 ) .",
    "matsumoto ( 2001 ) suggest that this source is the origin of the variability detected by asca . in its high flux state ,",
    "the emission from this source is comparable to the high - low flux we deduce from the rxte measurements .",
    "irrespective of the origin of the variable spectral component in m82 , it is important to note that about half of the measured emission is at most weakly varying . even though the superposed emission from many variable sources is non - varying , given the thermal ( unabsorbed ) character of the non - varying emission , and previous evidence for its spatial extent , it is reasonable to conclude that this emission is powered by starburst activity .",
    "cappi ( 1999 ) have suggested that the main high - temperature spectral components , which account for most of the observed 2 - 10 kev emission in both ngc 253 and m82 , are largely due to emission from hot galactic winds . while we do expect the intense star formation activity to drive hot galactic winds ,",
    "it is clear that thermal emission in sbgs is a superposition of emissions from a population of x - ray binaries , sn remnants , and galactic winds .",
    "the determination of the exact origin of the main high - temperature spectral component will be possible only when more sensitive spectral and imaging measurements are made of ngc 253 and m82 .",
    "both bepposax and rxte find no evidence for variability in the emission from ngc 253 , so this galaxy is not dominated by an agn . the best - fit temperature derived from the bepposax measurements ( cappi 1999 ) , @xmath31 kev ( 90% confidence ) , is roughly consistent with our best - fit value of @xmath32 ( 68% confidence ) , when the uncertainty in the background subtraction is included . even though the value of the iron abundance we determine here is lower than that deduced from the bepposax measurements , both are substantially uncertain and ( therefore ) in rough agreement .",
    "power law and thermal models were previously found to provide acceptable fits to the emission observed by asca from both m82 & ngc 253 ( ptak 1997 . ) in fact , moran & lehnert ( 1997 ) , who analyzed 1993 asca observations , concluded that the main component of the emission in m82 is nonthermal , and based on the similar values of the x - ray and radio power law indices , they suggested that the emission is from compton scattering of relativistic electrons by the local radiation fields .",
    "indeed , the low iron abundances we deduce here are puzzling given the intense star formation activity , and the associated processing of metal enriched interstellar gas in these galaxies .",
    "higher abundances are obtained not only when the dominant spectral component of the continuum emission is a power law , but in any case where nonthermal emission contributes appreciably to the overall emission .",
    "for example , if the 2 - 10 kev flux in the power law component is taken to be 25% of the thermal component , then the iron abundance in m82 increases from its best - fit value @xmath33 ( table 4 ) to 0.23 .",
    "it has previously been shown by goldshmidt & rephaeli ( 1995 ) that compton scattering of radio producing relativistic electrons by the far infrared radiation field can account for the substantial high energy ( @xmath34 kev ) emission detected by osse ( aboard cgro ) from ngc 253 ( bhattacharya 1994 ) .",
    "the similarities in radio properties of m82 and ngc 253 and their common starburst nature are sufficiently strong indications that compton scattering may play an appreciable role also in m82 .",
    "however , neither the bepposax pds nor the hexte observations were sufficiently sensitive to clearly detect this component at high energies where it can dominate the emission .",
    "we acknowledge useful comments by the referee on an earlier version of the paper .",
