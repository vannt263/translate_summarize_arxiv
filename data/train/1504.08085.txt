    "in the eigenvalue problem of a non - hermitian matrix , an exceptional point ( ep ) is a square - root branch point on a two - dimensional parameter space , at which not only eigenvalues but also the associated eigenvectors coalesce @xcite .",
    "the peculiar feature related to the ep is the exchange of eigenvalues and eigenvectors after a parameter variation encircling the ep once , of which topological structure is same as that of mbius strip @xcite .",
    "the eps and relating interesting phenomena have mainly been studied in open quantum systems described by non - hermitian hamiltonians such as atomic spectra in fields @xcite , microwave cavity experiments @xcite , chaotic optical microcavities @xcite , _",
    "pt_-symmetric quantum systems @xcite , and so on .",
    "besides the open quantum systems , the eps are also observed in coupled driven damped oscillators realized by electric circuits , which are purely classical systems @xcite .",
    "the amplitude death ( ad ) is the complete suppression of oscillations of the entire system when the nonlinear dynamical systems are coupled @xcite .",
    "the ad has been observed in many coupled dynamical systems and the ad is achieved by various types of coupling interaction , i.e. , the diffusive coupling in mismatched oscillators @xcite , delayed coupling @xcite , conjugate coupling @xcite , dynamical coupling @xcite , nonlinear coupling @xcite , etc .",
    "the ad has also been studied in networks of coupled oscillators @xcite and variety topologies such as a ring @xcite , small world @xcite , and scale free networks @xcite .",
    "recently , the suppressions of oscillations are strictly classified into amplitude death and oscillation death , where the asymptotic steady state is homogeneous and inhomogeneous , respectively .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we study the transient behaviors of coupled dissipative dynamical systems based on the linear analysis around the steady state .",
    "we find that the systems show the largest damping rate at an ep , which comes from the intrinsic feature of a square - root branch point .",
    "for the case of coupled limit cycle oscillators , the transient behavior into the amplitude death state is studied .",
    "we demonstrate that the ep is associated with a critical point of frequency locking , as well as the transition of the envelope oscillation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we show the occurrence of ep in coupled damped oscillators and discuss the damping behavior around the ep in a pedagogical way . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the transient behavior into the ad in coupled limit cycle oscillators , and it is explained based on the existence of an ep . finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "we consider the coupled damped oscillators , @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 are damping ratio and undamped angular frequency of the @xmath4-th oscillator , and @xmath5 is the coupling constant .",

    "( [ cdo ] ) in the logarithmic scale when @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "first , we consider uncoupled case , @xmath10 .",
    "as we set @xmath9 and @xmath11 , the time series of @xmath6 exhibits a stationary oscillation without damping , while an exponential damping appears in the time series of @xmath7 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "next , we consider a finite coupling strength of @xmath12 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) with @xmath9 and @xmath11 , both time series of @xmath6 and @xmath7 exhibit decays with envelope oscillations .",
    "their decay rates , given by the slope of time series of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the logarithmic plot , are equal . as @xmath13 increases from 0.1 , the period of the envelope oscillation and the decay rate increase .",
    "at @xmath14 , the envelope oscillation disappears and the decay rate reaches a maximum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ) .",
    "when @xmath13 increases further , the decay rate decreases again .",
    "for example , the time series of the case with @xmath15 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( d ) .",
    "although the amplitude of two oscillators are different , as shown in the inset , their decay rates are equal . in our work , we concentrate on the case that each uncoupled oscillators have zero or weak damping ratio so that their dampings are underdamped .",

    "coupling cases of @xmath12 with ( b ) @xmath19 , ( c ) @xmath20 , and ( d ) @xmath15 .",
    "insets show linearly scaled time series . ]    in order to understand the variation of decay rate with @xmath13 and its maximum at @xmath14 , we analyze the eigenvalues of a stability matrix around the origin .",
    "( [ cdo ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath21 this set of equations is represented by a vector equation , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "the stability matrix @xmath24 is then given by @xmath25 the eigenvalues @xmath26 of @xmath24 are complex numbers , because the matrix @xmath24 is non - hermitian .",
    "since the time evolution of an eigenvector @xmath27 is given as @xmath28 , the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues correspond to the decay rates and the angular frequency of the corresponding time series , respectively .",

    "the complex eigenvalues with positive imaginary parts are shown as a function of @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "when @xmath34 , real parts of two eigenvalues are very close but their imaginary parts are quite different , this means that the dynamics of eigenvectors would show almost same decay rate and different angular frequencies . in this range ,",
    "the time series of @xmath6 and @xmath7 would show a constant overall slope given by the close real parts , but they would have an oscillatory envelope whose frequency is determined by the difference of the imaginary parts of eigenvalues . this behavior has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . as @xmath13 approaches to @xmath35 ,",
    "the real parts of two eigenvalues decrease and the imaginary parts become closer with each other , which corresponds to the time series with a faster decay and a longer period of envelope oscillation , respectively .    as @xmath13 goes further beyond @xmath35 ,",
    "two real parts start to split but the difference of two imaginary parts become small .",
    "the splitting of two real parts indicates that the time series can be characterized by a combination of fast and slow decays .",
    "the fast decay might be seen only in the short time behavior and the slow decay , corresponding to the larger real part , dominates the long time behavior of the time series .",
    "thus , although two imaginary parts are still different , there is no envelope oscillation due to the fast suppression of one eigen - component with the lower real part ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ) .",
    "note that the larger real part , governing long - time behavior , has a minimum value around at @xmath14 , which explains the maximum decay rate observed in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "note that two complex eigenvalues are very close at @xmath14 as shown by the black lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we can expect that there should be a degenerate point , called exceptional point ( ep ) @xcite , where two complex eigenvalues coalesce , in the system parameter space . by adjusting @xmath33 a bit as @xmath30",
    ", we find an ep at @xmath36 , which is shown by the red lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "it is well known that two eigenvectors also coalesce at the ep and mathematically the ep is the square - root branch point .",
    "the ep can be characterized by a peculiar eigenvalue surfaces in a parameter plane . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( c ) and ( d ) , the surfaces of the two eigenvalues are plotted in @xmath37 plane .",
    "topology of the surface explains the exchange of two eigenvalues for a parameter variation encircling the ep @xcite .",
    "it is emphasized that the larger real part becomes a local minimum at the ep , indicating the local maximum decay rate in the parameter plane .",
    "in this section , we study the role of the ep when the amplitude death ( ad ) occurs in coupled limit cycle oscillators .",
    "let us start with the following system of two stuart - landau limit - cycle oscillators with diffusive coupling : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are complex variables , @xmath40 are the intrinsic angular frequencies of uncoupled @xmath41-th limit cycle oscillators , and @xmath5 is the coupling strength . without coupling ( @xmath10 ) , two limit cycle oscillators are attracted to the limit cycle with radii @xmath42 for @xmath43 and the origin for @xmath44 .",
    "stuart - landau limit - cycle oscillator is renowned as a paradigmatic model for studying the ad in coupled nonlinear oscillators because it is a prototypical system exhibiting a hopf bifurcation that can reveal universal features of many practical systems .",
