    "supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , with @xmath5 tev , are probably the most theoretically elegant solutions to stabilize the hierarchy between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) maintains the same gauge symmetries as the standard model , while introducing superpartners for the standard model particle content . in the past two decades ,",
    "`` standard '' experimental signatures of low energy supersymmetry have been carefully studied@xcite .",
    "the mssm is the minimal implementation of low energy supersymmetry .",
    "however , minimality should not be taken as a fundamental guiding principle in the search for new physics .",
    "in fact , the particle content of the sm advocates , if anything , _ non_-minimal physics . in particular , we consider it reasonable to anticipate extensions of the gauge sector as well as the higgs sector of the mssm .",
    "if the gauge structure or matter content of the mssm is extended , the phenomenology could be significantly different",
    ". there will be novel features deserving attention .",
    "new techniques and observables will have to be developed to extract the full information about the underlying model .    before outlining the main results of our study , we briefly remark on the current status of the study of experimental signatures of the mssm .",
    "as mentioned above , many now classic signatures have been studied@xcite .",
    "recently , special attention has been paid to a set of benchmark models@xcite . in particular , in sps1a , it has been shown @xcite that mass measurements at the lhc could be achieved to a very high accuracy .",
    "while such studies could be instructive , we remark that the well - studied benchmarks should not be regarded as generic points in the mssm parameter space .",
    "consequently , the methods of measurements employed probably only have limited applicability and the conclusions could be misleadingly optimistic .",
    "in a recent study , @xcite , it has been shown that there are degeneracies associated with both discrete ambiguities ( such as lsp identity ) and larger uncertainties ( such as slepton masses ) in such measurements for a generic point of the mssm parameter space .",
    "if supersymmetry is discovered at the lhc , one of the biggest challenges will be the study of the properties of the electroweak - inos and the sleptons . in the mssm , the production of electroweak - inos is usually dominated by the cascade decays of color - charged particles .",
    "such events will typically have a large number of jets , which makes the properties of the electroweak - ino difficult to study .",
    "as shown in @xcite , copious production of leptons in susy signals , typically associated with on - shell slepton production and decay , will greatly enhance our ability to study the properties of these superpartners and eliminating degeneracies .",
    "the direct production of sleptons @xmath8 that decay to electroweak - inos suffers from a lower rate as well as a large standard model background @xcite .",
    "although sleptons and electroweak - inos are easy to study in benchmark scenarios such as sps1a , where @xmath9 , this is not true generically .    in our study , we consider the lhc phenomenology of extensions of the mssm , with special focus on its electroweak - ino and slepton sector . for concreteness , we focus on one typical possibility of such an extension , an extra @xmath10 , @xmath11 tev , which couples to both quark and lepton supermultiplets .",
    "such an extension is fairly generic as it is present in many gut / string motivated top - down constructions @xcite-@xcite . for most of our study , we will consider , as an example ,",
    "@xmath12 . being the unique non - anomalous global symmetry of the standard model with generation - independent charges , it is perhaps the most likely extension to the gauge sector",
    ". we will consider more general possibilities in the discussion of discovery reach .",
    "we will demonstrate that the channel @xmath13 greatly enhances the discovery reach of @xmath14 , and that copiously produced sleptons give an interesting handle on the identity of the lsp .",
    "roughly , this only requires @xmath15 .",
    "the result of this study is presented in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "measuring the masses of the superpartners is usually quite difficult , as most of the kinematical observables only measure their mass differences .",
    "the unknown momenta of neutral lsp s lead to undetermined kinematical variables , hindering reconstruction of the event .",
    "guesses of unknown variables are usually unreliable since there are several of them .",
    "such a difficulty is expected to persist in the @xmath16 channel , which has 3 unknown variables .",
    "the existence of an on - shell @xmath3 provides one additional kinematical constraint and should enable us to do better .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is the development of a new method which fully takes advantage of such a constraint .",
    "this allows us to completely determine the slepton mass and the lsp mass with properly chosen observables .",
    "our method is presented in section [ sec : meas ] .    for most of this study",
    "we will assume for simplicity that the sleptons are degenerate in mass .",
    "we remark that we should expect a certain amount of splitting between the left - handed and right - handed sleptons , at least from the effect of rge running from a high scale .",
    "such effects are more prominent if the overall mass scale of the sleptons is low . in models such as gauge mediation where there is a significant contribution from a @xmath17 ,",
    "@xcite we expect a larger universal contribution to both left - handed and right - handed sleptons .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that the effect of left - right splitting is important and deserves further study .",
    "a detailed consideration of this issue is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "the methods we introduce for mass measurement could be modified , possibly by introducing additional observables , in order to deal with this further complication . in the conclusion of this paper",
    ", we will further argue that this effect does not impact the discovery reach as long as @xmath18 decays into both left and right sleptons are still allowed .",
    "if one of them becomes heavier than @xmath19 however , the signal significance should drop accordingly .    in our study , events are generated at the matrix element level using comphep-4.4.3 @xcite and piped through pythia 6.3 @xcite for initial state radiation and hadronization .",
    "pgs@xcite is used as detector simulation .    in section [ sec :",
    "disc ] , we investigate the reach at the lhc for sleptons in models with an extended gauge sector and compare it to the mssm for certain benchmark scenarios .",
    "we show how to use the @xmath3 to determine the lsp identity in section [ s : lsp ] . in section [ sec : meas ] , we discuss mass measurements for these benchmark scenarios .",
    "in this section and for most of this the paper we concentrate on the production channel @xmath20 where @xmath14 can be a sneutrino as well as a charged slepton .",
    "we also include the mssm process @xmath21 for comparison .    in general , we consider an extra @xmath22 , which couples to the sm fermions through @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the charge of the sm fermions under @xmath22 .    in the mssm",
    ", the @xmath25 mediated slepton pair production cross section falls sharply with @xmath26 , and therefore with increasing slepton mass . on the other hand , for @xmath27 ,",
    "the production through @xmath3 resonance is almost independent of @xmath28 , up to a very mild phase - space factor , leading to a great enhancement in the discovery reach . in figure",
    "[ fig : examplexsecn ] we display the improvement of the charged slepton ( one flavor ) production cross section over the mssm for our benchmark scenario , with a @xmath29 at 2.0  tev and @xmath30 .     at 2  tev and @xmath30 ( solid curve).,width=336 ]    in our analysis",
    "we preselect events with an opposite sign same flavor dilepton pair and use a jet veto ( where jets are identified using a cone algorithm with r=0.7 and a @xmath31 cut of 10 gev ) .",
    "this significantly reduces sm background at high @xmath32 . in our background analysis",
    ", we include w / z pair production generated by pythia , and in the case that the final state lepton is an electron we consider the effect of @xmath33 ( which we find to be negligible ) .",
    "the background analysis assumes @xmath34 statistics , which allows us to find a rough estimate for the slepton reach at the @xmath35 level .",
    "we use data samples of @xmath36 .    in the preselected events we consider two observables , the @xmath37 of the event and the @xmath31 of the softer lepton .",
    "as expected , we find that with these choices signal can generically be distinguished from background with relative ease by cutting on either of those observables .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig : examplesignatures ] .",
    "we also include the mssm case for comparison and see that it is difficult to separate from the background .",
    "direct production in the mssm was studied in detail in @xcite .",

    "we discuss briefly the reach in the mssm for each scenario in this section .",
    "our first scenario ( i ) has a bino lsp , with mssm parameters given by table [ tbl : mssmparams ] .",
    "sleptons are produced solely through @xmath40 and they decay to the lsp .",
    "sneutrinos do not play a role in this scenario . for a single flavor ( taken to be @xmath41 )",
    "we find that the slepton discovery reach at @xmath35 is @xmath42  gev .",
    "our next scenario ( ii ) has a wino lsp . in this case ,",
    "the left handed sleptons can decay to @xmath43 thereby reducing the number of dilepton events compared to ( i ) , while right handed sleptons can only decay through the effects of gaugino and higgsino mixing .",
    "the sneutrinos also produce dileptons as they decay to @xmath43 .",
    "we find that the @xmath35 discovery reach is @xmath44 gev .",
    "the pattern of the leptonic signatures in this scenario is quite interesting , which we will discuss in detail in the next section .",
    "we also include a scenario ( iii ) with a higgsino lsp which will be of interest when we attempt to determine the identity of the lsp in the following sections .",
    ".the mssm input parameters for the scenarios we consider .",
    "we decouple additional states by raising their mass above the squark and slepton masses . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we studied an integrated luminosity of @xmath36 .",
    "standard model background is negligible because of the two hard photons in the final state .",
    "requiring two hard leptons , two hard photons , and no hard jets , we find 640 candidate events .    given the mass of the @xmath3 ( which is easy to determine from another channel such as @xmath45 ) , the kinematics of the event in figure [ fig : harvardbbdiagram ] are determined up to a single unknown .",
    "therefore , for each such event , after imposing the constraints we are left with a one - parameter family of possible solutions for @xmath28 and @xmath46 . because the @xmath3 has a finite width , and because the constraints are solved numerically on a coarse grid , the one parameter family of solutions is in practice a scattering of points in @xmath47 space .",
    "all possible pairs @xmath48 that solve the constraints are not equally likely .",
    "ideally , each pair should be weighted by the probability that it would produce the observed event , @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the observed four momenta of the leptons and photons .",
    "the full probability function is difficult to calculate , so instead we use a simplified weighting function based only on the photon transverse momenta @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 photon momentum was chosen because the distribution of lepton @xmath54 from this decay is relatively flat .",
    "pythia was used to generate the photon @xmath54 distributions for 45 reference models with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "then , to compute the weighting function for each guess of @xmath57 , the appropriate @xmath54 distribution was interpolated from the 45 reference models .",
    "the total weight for each event is normalized to one .",
    "finally , the weighted distributions for all 640 candidate events are added together , and the weighted frequency counts in each bin are interpreted as the  likelihood \" of a given solution .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : likelihoodcombo ] .",
    "the maximal 5 gev by 5 gev bin is centered at @xmath58 gev and @xmath59 gev , which should be compared to the monte carlo input masses @xmath60 gev and @xmath61 gev .",
    "clearly , this is a sensitive measurement of the slepton and nlsp masses ; however , we have not done the monte carlo necessary to state reliable error bars . even without a weighting function ( i.e. @xmath62 for all observables ) , the maximum frequencies are found to be very close to the correct input masses .",
    "masses found by reconstructing 640 candidate events in every way consistent with kinematic constrains .",
    "the input masses are @xmath60 gev and @xmath61 gev , and the maximal bin is centered at @xmath58 gev , @xmath59 gev.,width=384 ]",
    "generically , we expect extensions of the gauge structure and the matter content of the mssm . in this paper , we have studied the impact on supersymmetry phenomenology of @xmath10 extensions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "we have demonstrated that such an extension will give us a much stronger handle on the sleptons and electroweak - inos . specifically , due to the enhanced slepton production cross section through @xmath63 , in comparison with the mssm process",
    "@xmath64 , we expect a greatly enhanced slepton discovery reach in this scenario . moreover ,",
    "with this additional source of on - shell sleptons , we have a much better handle on lsp identity .",
    "for example , simple signatures such as lepton counting reveal the existence of a chargino state degenerate with the lsp in the wino lsp scenario , distinguishing it from the bino - lsp case .    with an additional resonance , a @xmath3 in our case , we have more kinematical information to measure the masses of the superpartners involved in the decay chain .",
    "we developed a new method to take advantage of such a constraint .",
    "using this type of max - min variable in the analysis of our model allows us to completely determine the masses of the sleptons and the lsp .",
    "this class of observables should have a much wider range of applicability in more complicated decay chains . like standard edges and endpoints , @xmath4-like",
    "observables are particularly easy to implement because they do not require fitting parameters to a monte carlo simulation .    in a generic model where new particles are produced in pairs and the final state has only two invisible particles ,",
    "max - min variables can be devised that give additional constraints beyond the usual constraints provided by edges and endpoints . in the simplest case , @xmath65",
    ", there are no standard edges or endpoints but the original @xmath4 variable gives one constraint . in a more complicated decay with more intermediate on shell particles , for instance the decay to gravitinos in section [ ss : gravitinos ] , the edge in the @xmath66 invariant mass distribution gives one constraint on the two unknown masses and an appropriately designed max - min variable gives a second . as in the case of an on - shell @xmath3 , max - min variables can also be applied sequentially .",
    "the output of one variable can be used as the input to another applied higher in the decay chain .    in our study",
    "we have made the assumption that the sleptons are degenerate for simplicity .",
    "since the purpose of our paper is demonstrating the effect of a new set of signals and observables , rather than a comprehensive study , this assumption should simply be viewed as a useful first step .",
    "we do not expect small and moderate mass splittings of order @xmath67 to significantly affect the discovery reach since such a splitting should have little effect on the lepton @xmath68 and missing energy spectrum in figure [ fig : examplesignatures ] . making one of the sleptons heavier could in fact improve the discovery reach , as long as @xmath69 are still both allowed , since the slepton will decay into harder leptons . if one of the sleptons becomes too heavy for the z to decay into , we expect the signal significance to drop accordingly , depending on the change in the branching ratio to the remaining light slepton",
    ". for mass reconstruction , a method similar to the one we described , possibly by taking advantage of multiple end - points , should be applicable in the case of large l - r splitting .",
    "there are several other obvious directions to extend our study .",
    "first of all , one should also consider the case where the @xmath3 decays into electroweak - inos .",
    "for example , this would be the case if the pq symmetry were gauged and mixed with this @xmath10 .",
    "such channels will also allow us to have new windows into the structure of the electroweak - ino sector , which is generically difficult in the mssm .",
    "we have studied the decay channel of the @xmath3 into sleptons , but its decay into squarks is also interesting to consider . in this case , we expect to be able to extract additional information about the quark sector , complementary to that of the qcd production of such states .",
    "for example , if the @xmath3 couplings to the quark states are chiral , we could have an additional handle on the left - right splitting of the squarks .",
    "alternative extensions of the gauge structure of the mssm will undoubtedly give rise to other novel features of phenomenology .",
    "it would be interesting to explore typical examples of such scenarios .",
    "we would like to thank all members of the harvard lhc olympics team : nima arkani - hamed , clifford cheung , a. liam fitzpatrick , aaron pierce , philip schuster , jesse thaler , and natalia toro for stimulating discussions and collaborations in the early stage of this project .",
