    "cyg x-3 is a famous microquasar containing a wolf - rayet star and a compact object , whose nature or mass is not known ( @xcite ) .",
    "its giant radio outbursts have been observed once every several years .",
    "the centimeter emission of cyg x-3 during the bursts is composed of superposition of a series of short - lived flares and relatively static low - level emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "vlbi observations revealed that cyg x-3 has sometimes a bipolar relativistic jet ( @xcite , @xcite ) and sometimes a one sided jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is presumably the remnant of ejecta by the flares .",
    "although the radio emission arises through synchrotron process of relativistic electrons in the jet ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the behavior at millimeter - wave during the flares is not yet established . during the outbursts of 2006 , we found that time scale of the flares shortens apparently at the inverse of the frequency ( tsuboi et al .",
    "a millimeter wave observation with a higher time resolution is desirable to understand the mechanism of the flares .",
    "then it was reported that spectacular large outburst of cyg x-3 occurred again at april 2008 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we monitored the flux density of cyg x-3 with a high time resolution of 4 - 6 min using nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) of nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) for four days in the period from mjd@xmath3 ( may 7 2008 ) to @xmath4 ( may 12 2008 ) at both 90 and 102 ghz simultaneously .",
    "the nma consists of six 10-m element antennas equipped with double side band ( dsb ) superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) receivers with a single linear polarization feed .",
    "we used four element antennas , b , c , d , and e in the first three days and five element antennas , b , c , d , e , and f in the last day .",
    "the ultra - wide - band correlator ( uwbc ) with a 1ghz bandwidth was employed for the backend ( okumura et al .",
    "the quasar j2015 + 371 was observed every 17 minutes as a phase and amplitude reference calibrator .",
    "neptune was used as a primary flux - scale calibrator .",
    "the observed flux densities of j2015 + 371 at 90 and 102 ghz were both 3.3 jy during the four days .",
    "fig.1a and fig.1b show the examples of the uwbc output in the second day .",
    "they show the visibility amplitudes of cyg x-3 and j2015 + 371 on the baselines between antennas b - e and c - d , respectively .",
    "these are independent except for atmosphere variation . fig.1c and fig.1d show the gain variabilities of the baselines derived from the visibility amplitudes of j2015 + 371 .",
    "the uv - data were calibrated with the uvproc - ii software package developed at nro ( tsutsumi et al . 1997 ) . to obtain the flux densities averaged every 4 - 6 min for a short timescale light curve , we applied a point source model to the visibility data self - calibrated for phase using the atnf miriad package .",
    "we removed low quality data at low @xmath5 to get final results .",
    "for example , we used only the data from mjd@xmath6 to @xmath7 to make figure 4b .    .",
    "the frequency band is 90 ghz .",

    "the system noise temperatures were less than 250 k in both frequency bands during the observations of the four days .",
    "the difference of atmospheric attenuation between cyg x-3 and j2015 + 371 may produce artificial change of the flux density of cyg x-3 .",
    "we monitored the optical thickness of atmosphere through the system noise temperature .",
    "the thickness gradually change in the range of @xmath8 during the observations .",
    "the monitored thickness was applied for the correction of the flux densities .",
    "the difference of atmospheric attenuation may cause calibration error up to 10 % around lowest elevation , @xmath9 .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty of absolute flux density is at most 15 % .",
    "the remaining error is mainly caused by the calibration error between the primary flux - scale calibrators and j2015 + 371 , and phase noise by atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "therefore , the relative uncertainties of the flux density for adjacent bins should be better than the value .",
    "the flux densities of cyg x-3 at 90 and 102 ghz are plotted as a function of time in fig.2 .",
    "the first bin of our observation is at mjd@xmath10 ( may 7 2008 ) , about 19 days after the first rise detected with ratan-600 in april 2008 ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are the series of short - lived flares with amplitude of @xmath11 jy in mjd@xmath12 ( may 7 2008 ) .",
    "although there are daily intermissions between individual observations because cyg x-3 is not a circumpolar star at nobeyama , the peak flux density of the flares , or the activity of the outburst , gradually decreases with time in three days . eventually , the flux densities at mjd=54598 , 12 may 2008 , decrease to level of 100 mjy , which is similar to those of the non - burst phase . assuming the exponential decay of the activity , the e - folding decay time is estimated to be about 1.25 day , or 30 hours .",
    "fig.3 shows the spectral index , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , between 90 and 102 ghz as a function of the average flux density at 100 ghz .",
    "the spectral indexes of the flares with over 1 jy are almost zero .",
    "the average spectral index is @xmath15 .",
    "this shows that the flares in mjd@xmath12 ( may 7 2008 ) have flat spectra . in addition , the flares with 0.5 - 1 jy have flat spectra . the spectra suggest that the flares have medium optical thickness , or that the mm - wave synchrotron emitting electrons are being accelerated so that they have the energy spectrum of @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "the average spectral index of low level emission is @xmath17 .",
    "the spectral index may be inverted although the scatter of the data is fairly large .",
    "the inverted spectrum may suggest optically thick synchrotron emission from a partially self - absorbed jet because optical thickness can vary the spectral index from @xmath18 down to @xmath19 .",

    "although there are the series of short - lived flares with @xmath11 jy in mjd@xmath12(7 may 2008 ) the peak flux density of the flare decreased for three days .",

    "4-a , the source undergoes successive flares so that the flux densities does not decay bellow 1  jy .",
    "the observed peak flux densities at 90 and 102 ghz are up to 2.2 jy . the @xmath0-folding rise and decay time of the peaks",
    "is estimated to be @xmath31 h or shorter , although the precise times of the beginning and end of variations are difficult to determine .",
    "flux densities at 102  ghz ( blue dots ) are slightly larger than those at 90  ghz ( red dots ) in the rising phase of the peaks , and slightly less in the decay phase .",
    "this characteristic suggests that the change at 90 ghz is somewhat delayed compared with that at 102 ghz in the both phases .",
    "the delay , if any , are no more than a few minutes .    in fig .",
    "4-b , we observed a few peaks exceeding 1 jy . there is a large jump in flux density at mjd=54593.95 ( a black arrow ) . within 5 minute , the flux densities increase four times or more compared with the value of the previous scan",
    "the sudden increase at mjd=54593.95 in visibility amplitudes of cyg x-3 is also identified in fig.1a and 1b .",
    "because this was observed on two independent baselines , an antenna - based error , such like pointing - error , can not account for the observed jump .",
    "an artificial intensity jump due to abrupt change in the visibility amplitude of j2015 + 371 , baseline gain variability , or system temperatures , is unlikely , because no such change is identified in these data of fig .",
    "1 . in addition",
    ", the uncertainty caused by the difference of atmospheric attenuation was at most several % around the elevation of the observed jump .",
    "then we conclude that the abrupt intensity increase of cyg x-3 must be a real event .",
    "time delay between 90 and 102 ghz is not observed in these data .",
    "the abrupt increase may be explained in terms of the abrupt injection of synchrotron emitting electrons .",
    "the @xmath0-folding time of the increase is about @xmath32 minute .",
    "this is much shorter than the @xmath0-folding rise time observed in fig .",

    "the changes in visibility amplitudes of cyg x-3 are also visible in fig.1a and 1b .",
    "such change is not identified in gain and system noise ( see fig 1c , 1d , and 1e ) .",
    "the amplitudes of the change at both frequencies are as large as @xmath36 % .",
    "time delay of the change between 90 and 102 ghz is not observed in the data .",
    "the @xmath0-folding times of the flares are less than @xmath37 minutes .",

    ".    there may be another sudden change at mjd=54594.88 ( a black arrow ) in fig 4c . within 5 minute",
    ", the flux density of cyg x-3 decreases about half although the visibility amplitude of j2015 + 371 , the baseline gain variability , and the system temperatures were not abruptly changed .",

    "the origin of the peak is not clear currently .",
    "the brightness temperature of the emitting region , @xmath57 , is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the flux density , @xmath60 is the observing frequency , @xmath61 is the distance of cyg x-3 , and @xmath62 is the radius of the emitting region derived from the event in fig .",

    "this brightness temperature based on the abrupt intensity jump is as high as one tenth of `` inverse - compton limit '' for agn , @xmath67 k. the ratio of inverse - compton scattering loss , @xmath68 , and synchrotron radiation loss , @xmath69 , of the relativistic electrons is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are radiation energy density and magnetic energy density , respectively ( see eq . 5.60 in pacholczyk 1970 ) , and @xmath73 is the magnetic field strength of cyg x-3 . here",
    ", we assume @xmath74 because the observed spectral index is flat even at @xmath75 ghz . , and we also assume @xmath76 then @xmath77 if inverse - compton scattering loss dominates synchrotron radiation loss , life time of the relativistic electron would be short so that the emission would be invisible .",
