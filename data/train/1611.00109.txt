    "<S> in the present work , we propose the @xmath0 as the @xmath1 state by studying the @xmath2 invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath3 process . in the @xmath4 invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath5 process </S>",
    "<S> , we find a new resonance with the mass and width to be @xmath6 and @xmath7 mev , respectively , which could be a good candidate of the @xmath8 state . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical investigations on the decay behaviors of the @xmath9 in the present work support the assignments of the @xmath0 and @xmath10 as the @xmath1 and @xmath8 states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the @xmath11 state is predicted to be a very narrow state . </S>",
    "<S> the results in the present work could be tested by further experiments in the lhcb and forthcoming belle ii .    </S>",
    "<S> when checking the mass spectrum of the charmonia , one can find the charmonia above 4 gev are not abundant and our understanding of these states is not comprehensive . in the past decade , a number of the charmonium - like states around 4 gev have been observed experimentally ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details ) , which provides us a good opportunity to expand our knowledge of the charmonia spectrum . for the @xmath12 wave spin - triplet , </S>",
    "<S> the ground states have been well established long time ago , which are @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite . while for the first excitation of the @xmath12 wave state , the @xmath16 state has been confirmed , which was successively discovered in the @xmath17 process by belle and babar collaborations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath18 observed in the @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite processes is a candidate of the @xmath21 , and the @xmath22 firstly observed in the @xmath23 process by the belle collaboration in 2003 @xcite , was supported to be the @xmath24 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the mass gap of the @xmath16 and @xmath25 is about 370 mev . by adding this mass gap to the mass of the @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> , we can roughly estimate that the @xmath11 states should be below 4.3 gev , since the mass gaps become smaller with the radial quantum number increasing . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the masses of the @xmath9 state should be smaller than 4.3 gev , which indicate that the charmonium - like states below 4.3 gev with the positive @xmath26 parity could be the candidates of the @xmath9 states . very recently </S>",
    "<S> , the lhcb collaboration has confirmed the existence of the @xmath0 and the @xmath27 quantum numbers were determined to be @xmath28 @xcite , which could be a candidate of the @xmath1 state .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 was firstly observed by the cdf collaboration in the @xmath29 invariant mass spectrum in the exclusive @xmath30 decays with the statistical significance of the signal to be @xmath31 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mass and width of the structure were @xmath32 mev and @xmath33 mev , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later , the belle collaboration measured the cross sections for the @xmath34 and found no evidence of the @xmath0 @xcite , which would rule out the @xmath35 assignment for the @xmath0 . in 2011 , </S>",
    "<S> the cdf collaboration reanalyzed the process @xmath36 with a larger data sample @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained resonance parameters were consistent with the values reported from the cdf previous analysis @xcite , and the statistical significance of the @xmath0 was reported to be greater than @xmath37 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the previous analyses from the lhcb and babar collaborations did not find the evidence of the @xmath0 state in the @xmath30 and @xmath38 processes , respectively@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cms collaboration confirmed the existence of the @xmath0 in the @xmath39 and the significance of the @xmath0 was reported to be greater than @xmath40 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the d0 collaboration also observed the signal of the @xmath0 in the @xmath29 invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath41 process and the inclusive @xmath42 collision process @xcite .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : expcom ] , the mass and width of the y(4140 ) reported from different collaborations are presented @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noticed that the width reported by the lhcb collaboration is obviously larger than the one from other experimental groups , while the measurements from other three experimental collaborations are in line with each other . </S>",
    "<S> such a discrepancy is interesting and need more experimental efforts from different experimental groups . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the observation of the @xmath0 in other channels could also provide a key of resolving this discrepancy .    in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the belle collaboration reported their inclusive and exclusive measurements of @xmath43 decays to @xmath44 and @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> when looking at the @xmath2 invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath46 process , one can find a number of event near 4.1 gev . </S>",
    "<S> searching the signal of the @xmath0 in the @xmath2 invariant mass spectra could provide us more information on the intrinsic nature on the @xmath0 . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce one resonance near 4.1 gev as well as a non - resonance contributions to fit the experimental data for the @xmath2 invariant mass distributions reported by the belle collaboration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the non - resonance contribution is phenomenologically described by @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the upper and lower thresholds of the @xmath52 invariant mass distributions and @xmath53 is the invariant mass of the @xmath52 .    as for the resonance contribution , </S>",
    "<S> a phase space corrected breit - wigner distribution is adopt , which is in the form , @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the mass and width of the resonance , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 is the coupling constant , which will be treated as a free parameter in the fitting . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 is the phase space of the @xmath59 , which is @xmath60 with k@xmath61llen function @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> .the parameters obtained from fitting to the invariant mass spectra of the @xmath2 of the @xmath63 process and the @xmath4 of the @xmath5 process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> [ tab : para1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the coupled channel quark model and the screen potential model predicted similar mass spectra of charmonia but different with the quenched quark model @xcite . in table [ tab : spectra ] , a comparison of the charmonium mass spectrum from different quark models is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the masses from the screen potential model and the coupled channel quark model are much lower than the quenched quark model , especially for the higher charmonia . as for the @xmath64 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath65 is about 50 mev below the screen potential model prediction , and the predicted @xmath1 is located at 4178 mev @xcite , which is about 40 mev above the @xmath0 , thus from this point of view , the @xmath0 could be a good candidate of the @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> with such a discrepancy of the theoretical predictions and the observation , the mass of @xmath8 should be close to 4.09 gev , which is also consistent with the one of the @xmath10 observed in the @xmath5 process . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the mass of the @xmath11 should be about 4.17 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> _ decay behavior: _ the open charm decays of the @xmath9 could be estimated in a quark pair creation ( qpc ) model . in this model , the quark - antiquark pair creates from the vacuum with the @xmath66 , thus the qpc model is also named @xmath67 model , which was proposed by micu @xcite and widely used to calculate the ozi allowed decay process @xcite . for </S>",
    "<S> the ozi allowed strong decay process @xmath68 , the corresponding @xmath69 matrix is , @xmath70 in the nonrelativistic limit , the transition operator @xmath71 is defined as @xmath72 this transition operator is introduced to describe the quark - antiquark ( denoted by indices 3 and 4 ) created from vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenological creation strength @xmath73 for @xmath74 is taken as @xmath75 @xcite , while the strength for @xmath76 satisfies @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath78 is the @xmath79th solid harmonic polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are the general description of the spin , flavor , and color wave functions of the quark - antiquark pair , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the partial wave amplitudes could be related to the helicity amplitudes by @xcite @xmath83 and the partial width of @xmath68 is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the mass of the initial state @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the three momentum of the @xmath43 in the @xmath86 rest frame .    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) wave function @xmath88 to simulate the wave functions of charmonium , charmed and charmed - strange mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the value of a parameter @xmath89 appearing in the sho wave function can be obtained such that it reproduces the realistic root mean square ( rms ) radius , which can be calculated by the relativistic quark model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simple harmonic oscillator wave function with a parameter @xmath89 has been widely used to study the ozi allowed strong decays . in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the @xmath89 values of the low lying mesons were determined by the relativistic quark model and with these @xmath89 parameters , the decays of the mesons were also investigated , and the obtained results were consistent with the experimental measurements . in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the decay behaviors of the higher charmonium are estimated with the simple harmonic oscillator wave functions and the obtained results could well reproduce the corresponding experimental data , which proves such an approach is reliable to investigate the strong decays of hadrons .    </S>",
    "<S> the unquenched relativistic quark model achieved great successes in the description of the low - lying mesons . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the present calculations , we fix the @xmath89 values for @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 to be 1.52 , 1.85 , 1.41 and 1.69 @xmath94 , respectively , which are estimated from the relativistic quark model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> different from the charmed and charmed - strange mesons , the parameter @xmath89 introduced by the wave function of the @xmath9 is considered as a parameter since we are discussing the higher excited states in charmonium family , where the coupled - channel effects become important . </S>",
    "<S> the coupled effects not only shift the mass spectrum but also modify the wave functions of the quarkonium . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the width of the @xmath16 could be well reproduced when @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath89 value for the @xmath96 charmonia should be a bit larger than the one of the @xmath97 state , thus , we varies @xmath89 from 1.8 to 2.6 @xmath94 for the @xmath9 in the present work . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the constituent quark masses for charm , up / down , and strange quarks are adopted to be 1.60 , 0.22 , and 0.419 gev , respectively @xcite    the @xmath89 dependences of the total and partial widths of the @xmath9 states are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : decay ] . based on the estimations in the present work </S>",
    "<S> , we find    \\(1 ) as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : decay]-(b ) , the estimated total width of the @xmath1 could overlap with the experimental data reported by cdf @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations , but can only reach up to the lower limit of the lhcb measurement @xcite , which indicates that the present calculations support the @xmath0 to be a narrow state and is also consistent with our fit to the @xmath2 invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath3 process .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(2 ) the estimated total and partial widths of the @xmath8 are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : decay]-(a ) . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also present the width obtained from our fit to the @xmath4 invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath5 process . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated total width is consistent with the fitted one in the range of @xmath98 , which is similar to the one determined by the total width of @xmath1 . in this @xmath89 range </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath8 dominantly decays into @xmath4 , that is why we could observe its signal in the @xmath4 invariant mass spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(3 ) for @xmath11 , the partial widths are strongly dependent on the parameter @xmath89 due to nods in the wave function of the charmonium . however , the estimated total width of the @xmath16 state is rather stable , which is of order 10 mev in the considered @xmath89 range . </S>",
    "<S> this particular property of the @xmath11 could be a crucial test to the present calculations .    to summarize , we find a narrow resonance in the @xmath2 invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath3 process with the resonance parameters consistent with the values of the @xmath0 reported in the @xmath99 invariant mass spectrum , which indicates that the resonance in both processes could be the same one . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 is assigned as the @xmath1 rather than a @xmath100 molecule state or @xmath101 tetraquark state due to its coupling to the @xmath2 and the charmonium mass spectrum predicted by the screen potential model . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 could be a good process of observing the @xmath0 since the @xmath0 is far above the threshold of the @xmath2 , which could avoid the pollution of the threshold effect and under threshold resonance . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find a @xmath102 candidate in the @xmath4 invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath5 process . </S>",
    "<S> the mass and width of this new state is fitted to be @xmath103 mev and @xmath104 mev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations of the total widths of the @xmath8 and @xmath1 in the quark pair creation model are well consistent with those extracted from the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> further more , the present calculations also indicate that the @xmath11 is a rather narrow state . </S>",
    "<S> these results in the present work could be tested by further experiments in the lhcb and forthcoming belle ii .    </S>",
    "<S> besides the open charm decays of the @xmath9 states , the hidden charm decay processes of these states are also important . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the candidate of the @xmath1 , @xmath0 is observed in the @xmath29 and @xmath2 modes , and in principle , this state could also decays into @xmath105 . at present , there exist the measurements of the @xmath105 invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite processes from both belle and babar collaborations . for the former process </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath0 is forbidden with the @xmath1 assignment . while for the @xmath20 process </S>",
    "<S> , one can find the bin size of the experimental data around 4.1 gev is 40 mev , which is about 2 to 3 times larger than the width of the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it would be difficult to find any evidence of the @xmath0 in the present experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the future precise experimental measurements of the @xmath20 could provide us more information of the structures in the @xmath105 invariant mass spectrum .    before the end of this work </S>",
    "<S> , we mention that the @xmath106 collision could be an ideal process of searching @xmath12 wave charmonia , in which @xmath18 and @xmath107 had been observed . in the @xmath17 process </S>",
    "<S> , there is a single bin bump at 4.085 gev in the belle data @xcite , while in the babar data a bump appears at 4.095 gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the experimental data in this energy range have large errors , more precise measurements from the forthcoming belle ii could further check the relation of this bump and the @xmath8 state . </S>"
