    "@xcite have been devoted to understanding the nature of the low - lying @xmath4 resonances .",
    "however , their properties still bare a lot of controversies .",
    "for example , in the naive quark model the @xmath21 is classified as the lowest @xmath22 orbital excited @xmath23 state as an @xmath24 flavor singlet @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it is also proposed to be a dynamically generated resonance emerging from the interaction of the @xmath0 and @xmath25 with a multi - quark structure @xcite .",
    "most of those studies are based on the unitary chiral perturbation theory ( u@xmath26pt ) .",
    "such a scenario is developed further which proposes that the @xmath21 could be a superposition of two resonances @xcite .",
    "similar mechanisms are studied in various processes @xcite , such as @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , as a support of the dynamically generated states . how to clarify these issues and make a contact with experimental observables are still an open question  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is of great importance to understand the excitation of those low - lying @xmath4 states in a quark model framework . quark model somehow provides a guidance for the underlying effective degrees of freedom within hadrons . in order to probe exotic configurations such as multiquarks and hybrids , one should also have a good understanding of where the non - relativistic constituent quark model ( nrcqm ) breaks down . particularly in the sector of hyperon states , there are still a lot of ambiguities to be clarified .",
    "apart from the @xmath21 , the @xmath30 and @xmath31 are also suggested to be quasibound states of a meson and a baryon , which are dynamically generated resonances based on the u@xmath26pt  @xcite . while in the quark model these two states are classified as the lowest @xmath22 orbital excited states with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . to clarify the nature of those low - lying @xmath4 resonances and their internal effective quark degrees of freedom ,",
    "more theoretical and experimental studies are needed .",
    "recently , the higher precision data of the reaction @xmath34 at eight momentum beams between 514 and 750 mev / c were reported @xcite , which provides us a good opportunity to study the properties of these low - lying @xmath4 resonances . in this work",
    ", we make an investigation of the @xmath1 reaction in a chiral quark model . in this model",
    "an effective chiral lagrangian is introduced to account for the quark - pseudoscalar - meson coupling .",
    "since the quark - meson coupling is invariant under the chiral transformation , some of the low - energy properties of qcd are retained .",
    "the chiral quark model has been well developed and widely applied to meson photoproduction reactions  @xcite .",
    "its recent extension to describe the process of @xmath35 scattering  @xcite and investigate the strong decays of charmed hadrons  @xcite also turns out to be successful and inspiring .    in the literatures",
    "the @xmath0 scattering has been studied using different approaches , such as the @xmath36-matrix methods @xcite , dispersion relations @xcite , meson - exchange models @xcite , coupled - channel approaches @xcite , and quark models @xcite .",
    "compared with these models , our model has several obvious features .",
    "one is that only a limited number of parameters will appear in the formalism . in particular , only one parameter is need for the resonances to be coupled to the pseudoscalar meson .",
    "this distinguishes from hadronic models where each resonance requires one additional coupling constant as a free parameter .",
    "the second is that all the resonances can be treated consistently at quark level .",
    "thus , it has predictive powers when exposed to experimental data , and information about the resonance structures and form factors can be extracted .    in the @xmath1 reaction , for the @xmath37-channel",
    ", the @xmath38- and the @xmath39-mesons can not couple to the same quark in a baryon , which leads to a strong suppression in the @xmath37-channel amplitudes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , the amplitude @xmath40 is suppressed relative to @xmath41 by a factor of @xmath42 with @xmath43 for the main quantum number of the nrcqm harmonic oscillator potential  @xcite . in contrast , it is allowed for the @xmath12-channel that the kaon and pion are coupled to the same quark .",
    "thus , the @xmath12-channel gives a large background in the cross section , and has significant destructive interferences with @xmath6 at the forward angles .",
    "the @xmath13-channel , dominated by the @xmath14 exchange , also plays an important role in the reactions .",
    "it suppresses the cross section obviously at the backward angles , while enhances it at the forward angles .",
    "we also consider the @xmath13-channel scalar meson exchange , i.e. @xmath15 , but find its contributions are negligibly small .",
    "the @xmath21 governs the reaction in the whole energy region near threshold which is similar to the @xmath44 dominance in @xmath45  @xcite . around @xmath46 mev / c ,",
    "the @xmath30 is responsible for the sharp resonant peak in the total cross section .",

    ", the agreement implies some similarity of the coupling structure at leading order .",
    "for instance , the meson - quark couplings in our model can be related to the meson - baryon couplings via current conservation such as the recognition of the goldberger - treiman relation  @xcite .",

    "this prescription indicates that the @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 still possess features of the traditional 3-quark states though they may also have some exotic properties which are not sensitive to the measurement of the cross sections .",
    "experimental measurement of polarization observables may be more selective for exposing their natures , especially for the @xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless , more accurate differential cross sections in the low beam momentum region , e.g. @xmath267 mev / c , should also be useful .    for higher resonances ,",
    "we expect more accurate data in the region of @xmath268 mev / c can be useful for clarifying their contributions and properties . with such data available , we can then further study the role of @xmath9 , @xmath11 and the other higher @xmath269- and @xmath270-wave resonances in the @xmath202 shell .",
    "the j - parc facilities , which start to run recently , will provide great opportunities for the study of the hyperon spectrum in theory .    by comparing with approaches at hadronic level ,",
    "so far we have not yet included the coupled - channel dynamics .",
    "it would be interesting and extremely useful to develop a coupled - channel calculation in our framework for baryon resonance excitations in meson - nucleon scattering and meson photoproduction .",
