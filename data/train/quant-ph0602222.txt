    "at present , the properties of three level optical and atomic systems ( qutrit states ) evoked a great interest in modern problems of quantum information and communication [ 1 - 5 ] .",
    "in fact , implementation of qutrit states in quantum system is more preferable than qubit presentation in some cases - see also [ 3 ] .",
    "establishment of qutrit states in quantum optics can be realized by different ways [ 2,4,5 ] .",
    "one of them is taking into account the three optical mode entanglement at multiport beam - splitter ( tritter ) [ 4 ] .",
    "other possibility is based on exploiting nonlinear spontaneous down conversion ( spdc ) process as a source of entangled linearly polarized photons [ 5 ] . in this case",
    "the polarization characteristics for biphoton state can be represented by three components of polarization vector .",
    "another keystone problem is to measure the qutrit state characteristics .",
    "nowadays the quantum state tomography approach is being discussed for that [ 6 - 8 ] .",
    "the basic idea of the method is to reconstruct the density matrix elements by a set of measurements ( projections)_. _ the quantum tomography for low dimensional systems , e.g. for spin states , has been firstly proposed in [ 9,10 ] .",
    "it has been shown that the density matrix elements can be reconstructed from marginal distributions - for especially prepared diagonal elements of density matrix with the help of unitary transformation . in quantum optics the density ( or coherency ) matrix elements can be expressed in terms of su(2 ) observables - stokes parameters of optical field [ 11,12 ] .",
    "in fact , the procedure of spin state tomography is very close to the usual classical ellipsometric measurement technique [ 12,13 ] . for last case",
    "the measured intensity of light @xmath0 depends on @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters introduced by linear optical elements , i.e. , phase plates , polarizators .",
    "thus , we need at least four measurements of the stokes parameters @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) for complete determination of the light polarization state . in quantum domain",
    "the stokes operators @xmath5 do not commute with each other , and therefore the procedure of the measurement of these parameters should be clarified . in general , for quantum optical field we are able to carry out the measurements consecutively with any desired accuracy .",
    "but in this case the number of copies of initial quantum state of the system is absolutely necessary in order to do the measurements [ 6,7 ] .    according to alternative operational approach",
    ", the measuring apparatus operates with initial quantum state of the system and performs all measurements for non - commuting observables simultaneously with some accuracy determined by uncertainty relations .",
    "the approach becomes more preferable in some cases , and results in obtaining unique information about quantum characteristics of the system , e.g. for the problem of optical phase measurements [ 14 ] and quantum polarization phase characteristics determination [ 15 ] .",
    "in particular , in [ 15 ] we consider a special multi - port interferometer for simultaneous measurements of all polarization stokes parameters of light .",
    "the quantum error of the measurement is determined by vacuum field fluctuations , and plays a principal role in the case as it can not be avoided due to quantum nature of optical field .",
    "such an approach permits to obtain the complete information about the density matrix elements ( i.e. coherency ) and to evaluate the degree of polarization for light as well .    in this paper",
    "we are developing a quantum theory for the su(3)-polarization symmetry systems .",
    "the approach is based on three mode interaction in quantum optics in general .",
    "we analyze the quantum phase and amplitude properties in three level system . in section 2 the mathematical description of the su(3)-polarization states for optical fields",
    "is presented .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the problem of operational determination of non - diagonal elements of the coherency matrix and degree of polarization with the help of the gell - mann parameters of optical field by simultaneous measurement by means of the twelve - port interferometer .",
    "the measurement of amplitude characteristics of three mode optical field is considered in section 4 .",
    "the quantum three - mode bose - system with su(3)-symmetry can be described in the schwinger representation by hermitian gell - mann operators @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) ( cf . [ 8 ] ) :    @xmath8    where @xmath9(@xmath10 ) , @xmath11 are the photon annihilation ( creation ) operators . the operators @xmath12 defined above in eq .",
    "( 1 ) obey standard commutation relations for su(3)-algebra - see e.g. [ 8 ] .    in expression ( 1a )",
    "the operator @xmath13 determines the total number of photons ; the operators @xmath14 present the su(2 ) sub - group of the su(3)-algebra . in quantum optics",
    "this sub - group corresponds to the polarization stokes parameters @xmath5 for the optical field , where the modes 1 and 2 are two linear ( circular ) polarization components of light [ 11 ] .",
    "the operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 in expressions ( 1c , d ) characterize coupling between first two modes ( @xmath17 ) and the third one ( @xmath18 ) , respectively . the operator @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( 1e ) is described by a combination of photon numbers for all modes of quantum field .",
    "let us introduce the unit vector @xmath20 for a three mode system in hilbert space :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is annihilation operator for a three - mode field ; @xmath23(@xmath11 ) are orthogonal vectors under the condition    @xmath24    the relation ( [ eq6 ] ) can be written as :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 are the projections of vector @xmath20 .",
    "the expressions ( 2)(4 ) determine decomposition of a three - mode optical field by the analogy of usual decomposition of elliptically polarized light in respect of two orthogonal ( linearly or circularly ) polarization components in quantum optics  cf .",
    "[ 13 ] . however",
    "only two orthogonal vectors fulfil to transversality condition for plane waves .",
    "therefore the physical meaning of @xmath27 parameters in expressions ( 2)(4 ) should be clarified for each of specific polarization problems .",
    "for example , we also refer here to some problems of quantum optics when additional ( longitudinal ) component of polarization is presented ( see e.g. [ 16 ] ) and our description can be useful .",
    "thus , we rewrite expression ( [ eq8 ] ) for the three - mode problem in terms of the four parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 according to the su(3 ) symmetry approach ( see e.g. [ 8 ] ) :    @xmath32    where parameters @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 .    the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 describe amplitude characteristics of the three level quantum system .",
    "the phase properties of quantum state of optical field with su(3)-symmetry are determined by parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "let us consider the su(3)-polarization state for coherent optical field :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the coherent state of the three - mode field .",
    "with the help of expressions ( [ eq8])-(6 ) we obtain :    @xmath37    in the paper we also examine the following tripartite state that can be established as ( cf . [ 17 ] ) :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is a vacuum state ; @xmath40 is the total number of particles . for microscopic limit ,",
    "when @xmath41 , we have a tripartite entangled qutrit w - state for a three level system :    @xmath42    the state @xmath43 can be produced by using a tritter [ 4 ] .",
    "the maximally entangled state is realized for @xmath44 ( @xmath45 , but for some problems of quantum information the maximally - entangled qutrits are not optimal - see e.g. [ 1 ] . in the paper we also consider non - symmetric qutrit w - states that can be obtained from eq.([eq13 ] ) for @xmath46 .    for @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) the qutrit state @xmath43 in eq.([eq13 ] )",
    "reduces to one of three qubit states @xmath51 .    with the help of definitions",
    "( 1 ) it is easy to obtain the following relations for the gell - mann parameter variances for the optical field in state @xmath52 :    @xmath53    where the expressions @xmath54 represent the variances of gell - mann parameters ( 1 ) for coherent state ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "the inequality in ( [ eq14 ] ) characterizes non - classical properties of entangled states ( [ eq12 ] ) , ( [ eq13 ] ) when the optical field fluctuations that correspond to the gell - mann parameter variances are suppressed below the level of fluctuations for coherent states , i.e. the effect of squeezing occurs .",
    "let us consider for the first time the problem of degree of polarization for optical field with su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "we start from classical definition for a two - mode optical system .",
    "in particular in the case of stochastic plane waves the degree of polarization @xmath55 can be represented as  see e.g.  [ 13 ] .",
    ": @xmath56 where @xmath57 is coherency matrix of size @xmath58 .",

    "( [ eq11p2 ] ) can be rewritten in terms of stokes parameters @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) for two - mode optical field as : @xmath64    although there are various definitions of degree of polarization in quantum optics ( we do not discuss them in the paper ",

    "( [ eq12p2 ] ) represent expectation values of the stokes operators @xmath65 .",
    "now we switch our attention to the case of three - mode optical system ( non - plane waves  cf .  [ 13 ] ) .",
    "quantum properties of optical field with su(3)-symmetry can be described in this case by the following density ( or coherency ) matrix @xmath66 :    @xmath67    in general , scalar invariants @xmath68 and @xmath69 take place in this case .",
