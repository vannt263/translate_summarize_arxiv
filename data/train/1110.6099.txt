    "the standard collinear qcd factorization theorems have set the standard for the use of perturbative qcd calculations to probe certain properties of the microscopic structure of matter .",
    "it will be instructive to recall the essential ingredients that lend the standard factorization treatments their predictive power :    * unambiguous prescription for calculating pertrubatively well - behaved higher order corrections to the hard scattering .",
    "* correlation functions describing the non - perturbative factors are well - defined and have universality properties so that , once measured , they can be useful for future phenomenological studies . * evolution equations , to allow the correlation functions to be compared at different scales .",
    "the collinear pdfs and fragmentation functions have by now been parametrized by a wide range and variety of experimental data , and have become indispensable tools in general high energy physics . ideally , tmd - factorization , in which the pdfs and fragmentation functions also carry information about the intrinsic transverse momenta of partons , should follow a very similar framework .",
    "however , it is only very recently  @xcite that tmd - factorization has reached a level of logical completeness similar to the well - known collinear cases . as long there was ambiguity in the formulation of tmd - factorization",
    ", the procedure for correctly identifying tmds in fits , as well as the correct procedure for implementing evolution has remained unclear .    in the absence of a full tmd - factorization treatment ,",
    "there have been several popular but separate approaches for dealing with tmds :    * generalized parton model ( gpm ) : a phenomenological approach is to extract tmds from fits to data while assuming a literal parton model interpretation of the tmds .",
    "one typically ignores evolution and therefore the fits correspond to specific scales .",
    "* resummation : begin with a collinear treatment valid for large transverse momentum , and attempt to improve the treatment of lower transverse momentum by resuming logarithms of @xmath1 .",
    "a severe limitation of this approach is that it is bound to fail below some @xmath2 , where many of the most interesting effects of tmd physics are expected to become important .",
    "* models : non - perturbative models of tmds can be used to study specific non - perturbative aspects of hadron structure ( see a. bacchetta s talk for a review of model calculations . ) .",
    "but there are ambiguities in how these tmds are related to the ones used in actual perturbative qcd calculations of cross sections .",
    "in particular , it is unclear what hard scale they should correspond to .",
    "* lattice calculations : lattice calculations of tmds ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) describe the non - perturbative distribution of patrons from first principles , but also require a clear definition for the tmds , and a clear prescription for use in complete cross section calculations .",
    "a useful tmd - factorization treatment should allow the advantages of each of these approaches to be unified within a single , clear formalism for relating tmd studies to observable cross sections .",
    "fortunately , this is now possible following the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see , esp . ,",
    "chapts . 10 and 13 ) .",
    "( a similar general approach was developed earlier by ji , ma , and yuan  @xcite , which built upon the collins - soper - sterman ( css )  @xcite formalism . )",
    "we will show how fits to tmds can be constructed from existing work that follows the above tabulated approaches , but which include evolution and are consistent with a full tmd - factorization .",
    "we apply the tmd - factorization method developed recently by collins in ref .",
    "@xcite . the factorization theorem for the drell - yan ( dy ) process , for example ,",
    "is @xmath3 note the similarity of the first term above to a gpm description ; there is a hard part @xmath4 and a convolution of two tmd pdfs , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "however , in the full tmd - factorization treatment , they have acquired scale dependence through the renormalization group parameter @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( which obey @xmath10 ) . moreover , there is no explicit appearance of a soft factor .",
    "the first term in eq .  [ dyhadronic ] is appropriate for describing the small @xmath2 region ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the @xmath12 term corrects the large @xmath2 behavior and can be calculated in terms of normal integrated pdfs . ref .",
    "@xcite derives very specific operator definitions for the tmd pdfs , which include the role of soft gluons and account for all spurious divergences which have hindered efforts to clearly define the tmd pdfs in the past .",
    "the evolution of the individual tmds in transverse coordinate space is governed by the collins - soper ( cs ) equation  @xcite , @xmath13 and the renormalization group equations , @xmath14 in eq .",
    "[ csevolution ] , @xmath15 is the kernel for evolution with respect the energy variable @xmath16 , while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the anomalous dimensions .",
    "these can all be calculated in perturbation theory , though @xmath15 becomes non - perturbative at large @xmath19 and needs to be fit .",
    "it is a universal function , however , both with respect to different processes and with regard to pdfs versus fragmentation functions .",
    "working within a gpm approach , gaussian parametrizations have been fit to various tmds in , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite from low energy sidis measurements . the non - perturbative information corresponding to @xmath15 at large @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ csevolution ] ) has been extracted from more traditional applications of the css method , such as in ref .",
    "@xcite . with",
    "the non - perturbative parts constrained , specific tables for the tmds in eq .",
    "( [ dyhadronic ] ) can be generated for any arbitrary scale @xmath20 once the perturbative contributions have been calculated .",
    "we have carried this out explicitly for the unpolarized tmd pdfs and fragmentation functions in ref .",
    "@xcite , and have made the results available at the website : + https://projects.hepforge.org / tmd/. + an example showing the unpolarized up quark pdf for a selection of @xmath20 values is the graph in fig .",
    "[ tmdpdf ] .",
    "note that , once the @xmath12 term is included in eq .",
    "( [ dyhadronic ] ) , the factorization formula exactly valid over the whole range of @xmath0 from @xmath21 to @xmath20 .    ,",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 gev . ]",
    "a crucial element of the tmd - factorization approach is that the tmds are well - defined and , therefore , can be taken to be genuinely universal .",
    "one consequence of this is that different theories of the non - perturbative properties of hadron structure can be compared with one another , and with experimental results over a range of hard scales .",
    "ultimately , in order to take full advantage of the predictive power of tmd - factorization , requires a concerted effort to improve upon non - perturbative fits , to calculate higher orders to the anomalous dimensions , k , the coefficient functions , and the hard parts , and to provide numerical implementations of evolution in transverse momentum space similar to what has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , but applied to other tmd pdfs and fragmentation functions , including interesting spin dependent ones .",
    "we have recently been involved in efforts to extend evolution to the sivers function  @xcite , and plan to continue this work to generate evolved fits for most of the various spin - dependent tmds .",
