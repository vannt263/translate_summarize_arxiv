    "interfacial instabilities in three - dimensional channels give rise to a rich phenomenology in systems that range from nano and microscales@xcite to macrometric channels@xcite , and from which a number of practical applications can be drawn .",
    "for instance , controlled drop breakup in micro - channels has proved useful in the fabrication of low polydispersity micro - emulsions@xcite and in the enhancement of micro - reaction processes@xcite . in the latter , three - dimensional effects are crucial , as they are responsible of a vortex flow structure within the droplet@xcite that enhances the mixing process of the reactants .",
    "a widely studied interfacial instability in channels is that of fingering , which occurs whenever a low - viscosity ( or high - density ) fluid drives a high - viscosity(or low - density ) one .",
    "the instability , first studied by saffman and taylor@xcite , leads to interface dynamics where finger - like structures emerge and compete .",
    "the problem has a steady - state solution , composed by a single finger of constant velocity @xmath0 and occupies a fraction @xmath1 of the width of the channel .",
    "experimentally , finger growth has been studied mainly in hele - shaw cells .",
    "these consist of a pair of plates of length @xmath2 and width @xmath3 separated by a thickness @xmath4 . for such systems",
    ", it has been pointed out@xcite that the stationary finger is determined by a single control parameter , a modified capillary number defined as @xmath5 . for a fluid with viscosity @xmath6 and surface tension @xmath7",
    ", the capillary number , @xmath8 , measures the competition between driving forces , such as viscous stresses and gravity , and restoring forces , like surface tension .",
    "@xmath9 also includes the degree of asymmetry of the cell , given by the aspect ratio @xmath10 . if @xmath9 is the only control parameter of the system , all experimental data , _",
    "i.e. _ all finger widths , should be described by a single curve when plotted as a function of this parameter .",
    "contrary to this view , experiments show that there exists a family of curves @xmath1 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath9 for different aspect ratios@xcite .",
    "this fact suggests that a three - dimensional effect , given by the interplay between the dynamics in the channel - thickness and in the channel - width , is determinant for the steady - state solution .",
    "theoretically , fluid - flow in a channel at small velocities pertains to the lubrication regime , in which the flow occurs mainly along the direction of @xmath2 given that it is much larger than both @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "hele - shaw flows are a limiting case in lubrication theory , where @xmath4 is much smaller than @xmath3 . owing to the smallness of @xmath4 ,",
    "the problem is rendered effectively two - dimensional by averaging all fields over the thickness of the channel .",
    "averaging the equations of motion also reduces the interface from a surface to a line , often called the _ leading interface_. in views of the averaged model , three - dimensional effects enter as perturbative corrections to the boundary conditions that hold at the leading interface in terms of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , particularly to the gibbs - thomson condition , which relates the pressure drop across the interface to the interface curvature and surface tension .",
    "progress towards a three - dimensional description of the problem has been made since the pioneering work of saffman and taylor@xcite , who solved the problem of a stationary finger in the absence of surface tension in two dimensions .",
    "mclean and saffman@xcite included the effect of surface tension and were the first to obtain a @xmath1 _ vs. _ @xmath9 prediction by solving numerically the two - dimensional model . according to their results ,",
    "@xmath1 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath9 that saturates to @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",
    "the prediction of mclean and saffman is unique in @xmath9 , so the role of the aspect ratio is precluded from their theory .",
    "the relevance of three - dimensional effects was first suggested by park and homsy@xcite , who pointed out that a thin film of fluid in the channel - thickness direction would contribute to the pressure drop at the leading interface . using perturbation methods for slightly curved leading interfaces(small @xmath12 )",
    ", they found that for low @xmath11 the pressure drop varies as @xmath15 , a result that matched the early prediction of bretherton@xcite for capillary tubes .",
    "sarkar and jasnow@xcite used the modified pressure drop to solve the steady state finger .",
    "their results agreed better with experiments but were restricted to low values of @xmath11 .",
    "it was shown by tabeling and libchaber@xcite that corrections to the pressure drop can be used to reduce three - dimensional experimental data to the two - dimensional results of mclean and saffman .",
    "a modified pressure drop can be accounted for as an effective surface tension . using the correction of park and homsy , tabeling and libchaber",
    "were able to reduce their data to mclean and saffman results for moderately low values of @xmath9 , where fitting parameters were used to estimate the correction terms .",
    "in an experimental study@xcite , tabeling , zocchi and libchaber observed that , contrary to the mclean - saffman prediction , the finger width can go below the one - half limit for sufficiently high @xmath9 and sufficiently large @xmath12 .",
    "reinelt extended the expansion of the pressure drop up to @xmath16 in @xmath11 and included the effect of larger aspect ratios@xcite .",
    "computation of the steady state finger yielded solutions that better agreed with experiments for @xmath16 values of @xmath11 . for small @xmath12 reinelt observed a better agreement between numerics and experiments . however , for relatively large @xmath12 this agreement is lost .",
    "higher @xmath11 values have only been explored in the case of flat leading interfaces by halpern and gaver@xcite .",
    "their numerical results are consistent with results found by reinelt and saffman@xcite for @xmath11 @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and show that the pressure drop is insensitive to the capillary number for @xmath18 .    as an alternative to the sharp interface model ,",
    "a number of mesoscopic approaches have gained importance in interface dynamics .",
    "these are based on order parameter evolution equations of the cahn - hilliard type .",
    "being mesoscopic in nature , fluids are separated by diffuse regions instead of sharp interfaces , where the interface boundary conditions arise naturally .",
    "all mesoscopic models that address the viscous fingering problem so far are two - dimensional . for fluids of arbitrary viscosities and densities ,",
    "folch _ _ et al__@xcite used a set of coupled evolution equations for the velocity potential and order parameter that describes accurately the early stages of destabilization of the leading interface , and approaches mclean and saffman results as the viscosity of the displacing fluid is made negligible .",
    "the strict one - sided situation , were one of the fluids is inviscid , was studied by hernndez - machado  _ _ et al__@xcite .",
    "they used a single evolution equation for the concentration that includes dynamic effects in the form of chemical potential gradients and described correctly the steady state finger .    in a preceding paper@xcite",
    ", we have shown that a detailed three - dimensional description of fluid - flow in a channel can be done by means of a mesoscopic model which we implement numerically _ via _ a lattice - boltzmann algorithm .",
    "the model considers a fluid - fluid interface in contact with solid boundaries .",
    "in contrast to classic approaches , it allows for slip at the contact line by means of a diffusive mechanism inherent to the mesoscopic nature of the interface .",
    "this circumvents the complications of contact line dynamics in the classic formulation , associated to the viscous dissipation singularity@xcite . in ref.@xcite , we focused on the case of a flat leading interface .",
    "we showed that depending on the velocity of the contact lines , which we control by modifying the diffusion strength , the interface can either advance as a meniscus or develop as a finger . in the latter case",
    ", a thin film of displaced fluid is left adhered to the walls of the channel .    in this paper",
    "we extend our lattice - boltzmann simulations to the case of a non - flat leading interface , where a viscous finger is expected to appear .",
    "our aim is to provide a detailed description of the mechanisms that affect the steady finger and that cause deviations from two - dimensional results .",
    "to do so , we study fingers that form in the meniscus and thin film regimes separately .",
    "we cover values of @xmath11 up to @xmath19 and explore various aspect ratios .",

    "the impenetrability and stick boundary conditions at the walls are enforced by setting @xmath40 and @xmath41 . at both ends of the channel in the @xmath42 direction the flow is homogeneous .",

    "are altered .",
    "if we increase the aspect ratio(as in the high-@xmath9 region in fig .",
    "[ fig : results3d ] ) , then @xmath11 must decrease to keep @xmath9 fixed . as a consequence , the film thickness and the capillary pressure decrease as @xmath12 increases ,",
    "which is consistent with a narrower finger .",
    "this behavior has been observed , for instance , in experiments by tabeling , zocchi and libchaber@xcite , and addressed in numerical calculations by reinelt@xcite where the effect of the thin film was introduced perturbatively in the two - dimensional model .",
    "experiments suggest that , for high @xmath9 , increasing the cell aspect ratio has a thinning effect on the finger , which is what we observe in our simulations . results of reinelt suggest the opposite tendency .",
    "the aforementioned experiments were done at small @xmath12 and @xmath11 , and at high viscosity contrast , defined as @xmath130 . as we have shown in ref.@xcite , the thin film thickens as @xmath131 . under these conditions , experiments show that the finger width goes below the one - half limit even for cells with @xmath132 .",
    "this is due to the small thickness of the film which is a consequence of the low @xmath11 and high @xmath133 values used in experiments . in our simulations the thin film is about @xmath134 , much thicker than the experimental value , @xmath135 . as a consequence ,",
    "curvature effects in our simulations are strong enough to keep the finger width above one half even for high values of @xmath12 . to achieve the experimental regime thinner film should be considered .",
    "we have considered a cell aspect ratio of @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath11 is still too large , the film is then thick enough to keep us in the low @xmath118 regime , where the finger width is still larger than one half of the channel width . due to computational limitations",
    "we do not explore smaller @xmath12 .",
    "the fact that for a given @xmath9 there exist different finger widths for different aspect ratios raises the doubt of @xmath9 as being the only control parameter present in the system . to this end , we compute the rescaled surface tension @xmath138 , where the radii of curvature are measured at the finger tip .",
    "we then rescale the control parameter according to @xmath61 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rescaledresultsthinfilm ] we show a plot of the finger width as a function of the rescaled control parameter . at low @xmath118",
    ", results agree with mclean - saffman results .",
    "we conclude that in this region the finger is effectively two dimensional and that three - dimensional effects can be accounted for even at @xmath139 .    at high values of the rescaled control parameter ,",
    "our results deviate systematically from the mclean - saffman curve , until the finger width goes below the one half limit of the two - dimensional theory .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively different from the one found for the meniscus regime , in which the mclean - saffman curve could be recovered at any value of @xmath118 .",
    "hence , we conclude that deviations from two - dimensionality are caused by the thin film .",
    "an important feature in the @xmath1 _ vs. _ @xmath118 plot is that finger width appears to be determined by @xmath118 uniquely .",
    "this suggests that @xmath118 is the only control parameter of the problem .",
    "we have explored a region of values of the aspect ratio between the saffman - taylor(@xmath59 ) and rayleigh - taylor(@xmath140 ) limits of the fingering instability . in both limits",
    ", the relevant control parameter appears to be an effective modified capillary number . in addition , the interface shape is remarkably universal , as suggested by figs.[fig : shapes.2d ] and  [ fig : shapes.3d ] .",
    "we have carried out a detailed study of the viscous fingering problem in three - dimensional channels for fluids of different densities and viscosities .",
    "we have studied the single finger solution for systems in which either a thin film develops across the channel thickness or a meniscus is stabilized .    for systems in which no thin film is present ,",
    "mclean - saffman two - dimensional results describe the dependency of the finger width as a function of a rescaled modified capillary number , @xmath118 , which has a correction that depends curvature of the interface direction of the channel thickness .",
    "this holds for arbitrary high values of @xmath118 , evidencing that a complete displacement across the channel thickness renders the problem two - dimensional .",
    "we have extended our studies to situations where a thin film develops across the channel .",
    "we find different values of the finger width when changing the channel aspect ratios at fixed modified capillary number , an observation that is consistent with previous experiments@xcite .",
    "this non - uniqueness seems to disappear as the control parameter is corrected by curvature effects associated to the thin film , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the finger width is compared to @xmath118 .    for low @xmath118 , the finger width collapses to the mclean - saffman curve .",
    "however , at high @xmath118 the finger width deviates from this curve , and goes bellow the limit of one half in units of the channel width .",
    "our work is done at high values of the capillary number .",
    "consequently , the effective capillary pressure in our simulations is large enough to keep the finger above the one - half limit of the two - dimensional theory for high values of the channel aspect ratio .",
    "experiments in refs.@xcite were done in cells with @xmath141 and at @xmath142 , a regime that falls beyond the scope of this work for computational reasons .",
    "nonetheless , for low @xmath118 , we recover the same results , indicating that the same mechanisms hold , even if the actual aspect ratio and capillary number are not the same in experiments and simulations .    to our knowledge ,",
    "experiments of fingering in high aspect ratio channels have not been conducted so far .",
    "our results could be confirmed , for instance , in micro - channels , where the aspect ratio is typically large and in which the meniscus to thin film transition could be observed .",
    "this is then an open question for experimentalists to confirm .",
