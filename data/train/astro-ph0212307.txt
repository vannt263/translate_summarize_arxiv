    "temperature values were most stable in the core varying @xmath315 k , with variations of @xmath3115 k further out .",
    "the frequency dependence of dust grain emission efficiency in the mid - ir was approximated as @xmath32 .",

    "subtraction of the unresolved ( psf ) component scaled to @xmath41 of the peak results in a hole at the center of the residual emission .",

    "ngc  4151 also contains a radio jet ( johnston et al .",

    "the extended mid - ir  emission strongly coincides with the [ oiii ] emission out to a distance of @xmath51100 pc from the nucleus on either side .",

    "we see no extended emission in this direction and can only place an upper limit on the mid - ir size of @xmath4pc based on our resolution limit of @xmath53 - @xmath38 . scaling the psf to @xmath41 of the peak of ngc 4151 results in an upper limit of the unresolved component of @xmath54 of the total emission at 10.8 @xmath1 and 18.2 @xmath1 and a lower limit to the extended component of @xmath55 .",
    "table 1 shows our mid - ir flux density measurements .",
    "based on the conclusion from n90 that a nonthermal self - absorbed synchrotron source would be @xmath8mas , and hence unresolvable , our results are consistent with a thermal origin of the extended mid - ir emission .",
    "the re - radiation by dust grains heated by either stars or an agn may result in this extended thermal mid - ir  emission .",
    "however , processes such as fine structure emission lines may also produce extended mid - ir emission .",
    "several mid - ir fine structure lines were observed by sturm et al .",
    "( 1999 ) using iso .",
    "four of these emission lines fall within our broadband n and ihw18 filters and may contribute to this mid - ir emission .",

    "( 1999 ) , these emission lines contribute @xmath56 of the extended emission we observe at 10.8 @xmath1 and 18.2 @xmath1 .",
    "several mechanisms can contribute to thermal dust emission in the mid - ir .",
    "these include shock heating , in - situ star formation , dust in the nlr heated by the central engine , and a dusty torus .",
    "each is considered below in the context of the mid - ir emission we detect in ngc  4151 .",
    "shock heating of dust grains caused by the radio jet may contribute to mid - ir emission in ngc 4151 .",
    "mid - ir emission from shocks may be produced by either direct collisions between the plasma and dust particles ( draine 1981 ) or absorption of uv  radiation produced by the postshock cooling plasma ( dopita & sutherland 1996 ) . however , radial velocity measurements of kaiser et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show no correspondence between velocity or velocity dispersion and the positions of the radio knots of ngc 4151 .",
    "models by crenshaw et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also do not require strong shocks to explain the kinematics of the nlr .",
    "shocks may still contribute to the nlr as suggested by contini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , but are not considered to be a major source of ionization .",
    "recent [ fe ii ] observations by turner et .",
    "2002 ) also support this concept .",
    "thus shocks heating , though not ruled out , is not considered as a major source of the mid - ir  emission we observe .",
    "mid - ir emission has been observed to arise from star formation in the central regions of many galaxies ( e.g. telesco 1988 ) .",
    "the mid - ir provides an excellent trace of hii star forming regions whose emission peaks at far - ir wavelengths ( 50 - 200 @xmath1 ) .",
    "observations by engargiola et al .",
    "( 1988 ) at 155 @xmath1 show extended emission ( @xmath57 ) primarily in an east - west direction .",
    "iso far - ir  observations by re96 measure this emission as a cold dust component ( 36k ) consistent with dust heated in hii regions ( telesco et al .",
    "however , observations by p@xmath58rez - fournon & wilson ( 1990 ) in h@xmath59 show these hii regions exist in an elliptical galactic bar at a radius of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 kpc ) from the nucleus .",
    "thus these star forming regions can not contribute to the mid - ir emission we observe within our @xmath62  field of view .",
    "star formation in the circumnuclear region of ngc 4151 has been characterized using the strength of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah)emission .",
    "galaxies with strong nuclear star formation also feature strong pah emission .",
    "this pah  emission however is found to be weak or absent in agns with weak star formation ( roche et al .",
    "1991 ; genzel et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the case of ngc  4151 ,",
    "roche & aitken ( 1985 ) and imanishi et al . (",
    "1998 ) failed to detect pah emission at 11.4 @xmath1 and 3.3 @xmath1 respectively with their @xmath63 apertures .",
    "further observation by sturm et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also failed to detect any pah emission at 11.2 @xmath0 , 8.7 @xmath1 , 7.7 @xmath1 , or 6.2 @xmath1 .",
    "thus the mid - ir emission we observe on a scale of @xmath64 is unlikely to be associated with significant star formation .",
    "the most likely explanation for the `` extended '' mid - ir morphology in ngc 4151 is emission from a dusty nlr ( rieke et al .",
    "1981 ; re96 ) . dust in this region has a direct view of the central engine and hence can be heated resulting in extended mid - ir emission .",
    "the emission we observe follows the nlr as delineated by the [ oiii ] observations of kaiser et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , lending support to this concept .",
    "mid - ir emission coincident with [ oiii ] nlr emission has also been observed in other galaxies such as ngc 1068 ( braatz et al .",
    "1993 , cameron et al . 1993 ) and cyg a ( radomski et al . 2001 , 2002 ) . in both galaxies dust heated by the central engine most likely contributes to this emission .    in order to explore the possibility of central heating we calculated color temperatures based on the ratio of our 10.8 @xmath1 and 18.2 @xmath1 images .",
    "temperature and emission optical depth maps from simple radiative transfer analysis provide a good first - order estimate of the sources of grain heating as well as the relative density of warm grains ( tresch - fienberg et al .",
    "1987 ) . figure 4 shows our temperature and emission optical depth maps .",
    "we calculate color temperatures ranging from @xmath65 k in the core to @xmath66 k within the nlr ( @xmath67 pc ) , consistent with the warm dust component ( 170 k ) as measured by iso ( re96 ) .",
    "the emission optical depth shows the density of these dust grains is enhanced along the direction of the nlr . assuming a simple uniform dust distribution , a first - order determination of the size of the region that could be heated by a central source can be made .",
    "given that dust grains primarily absorb uv - optical radiation and re - emit in the infrared , the equilibrium temperature of dust in a strong uv field is given by ( sellgren et al .",
    "1983 )    @xmath68    in the above equation , t is the dust temperature , @xmath69 is the uv luminosity of the central source , @xmath70 is the radius from the source in parsecs , @xmath71 is the stefan - boltzman constant , and @xmath72 is the ratio of the planck averaged uv absorption coefficient to the infrared emission coefficient .",
    "values of @xmath72 are dependent on the dust grain size and composition and are given by draine & lee ( 1984 ) , laor & draine ( 1993 ) , and weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) for graphite and `` smoothed astronomical '' ( sa ) silicate .",
    "the observed uv - optical luminosity of ngc 4151 is @xmath73l@xmath74 ( penston et al .",
    "1990 ) . given this luminosity , in order to heat dust to the observed temperature of @xmath66 k at a distance of @xmath75 pc",
    ", the inner nlr  should be composed of @xmath76 @xmath1 graphite grains or @xmath77 @xmath1 sa silicate grains .",
    "these grain sizes fall near or below the limit of classical interstellar dust grains which range from 0.003 @xmath1 - 1 @xmath1 ( draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "they also are much smaller than the estimated grains sizes used for the centrally heated nlr models of ngc 1068 ( @xmath78 @xmath1 ; cameron et .",
    "al . 1993 ) and cyg a ( @xmath79 @xmath1 ; radomski et .",
    "al . 2002 ) .",
    "however penston et al . (",
    "1990 ) proposed that the continuum emission in ngc 4151 is inherently anisotropic and that the ionizing luminosity as seen within the extended nlr ( 1 - 2 kpc ) may be on order of 13 times greater than that observed from earth .",
    "subsequent models by schulz & komossa ( 1993 ) , yoshida & ohtani ( 1993 ) , and robinson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) also derive values for the anisotropy as high as 3 - 10 .",
    "thus a better estimate of the luminosity in the nlr may be @xmath80l@xmath81 .",
    "this higher luminosity would increase the calculated grain sizes by an order of magnitude ( @xmath82 @xmath1 graphite or @xmath83 @xmath1 sa silicate ) , resulting in sizes more consistent with classical interstellar dust and grain size estimates in the nlrs of ngc 1068 and cyg a. thus to first order , assuming that the luminosity in ngc  4151 is anisotropic , the extended mid - ir emission is consistent with heating of dust in the nlr from a central engine .",
    "another source of mid - ir emission in ngc 4151 may be from a dusty torus ( re96 ) .",
    "emission from a dusty torus may dominate the unresolved mid - ir component in ngc  4151 .",
    "it is considered that we view this disk / torus through a line - of - sight passing near the boundary edge ( cassidy & raine 1996 ) . assuming the torus lies perpendicular to the nlr , it s major axis would be oriented in an approximately north - south direction .",
    "we see no extended emission in this direction and can only place an upper limit on the mid - ir size of the torus of @xmath4 pc based on our resolution limit of @xmath37 - @xmath38 .",
    "this is consistent with the polarimetry observations and subsequent modelling of ruiz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) which suggest that the torus size in ngc 4151 is @xmath84 30 pc . a direct measurement of the torus may have been made by n90 . as previously mentioned , north - south scans by n90 measure the 11.2 @xmath1 emitting region to be 016@xmath1404 or @xmath52 pc . based on our `` unresolved '' ( psf ) component",
    "we therefore place an upper limit on the mid - ir contribution of a dusty torus of @xmath85 of the total emission at 10.8 @xmath1 and 18.2 @xmath1 .",
    "this represents the maximum contribution from a dusty torus and does not rule out contribution to the `` unresolved ' ' mid - ir emission from a self - absorbed synchrotron source .",
    "observations of neutral hi and molecular h@xmath86 by mundell et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and fernandez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) respectively , show evidence of a gaseous disk up to 25 ( 160 pc ) across which may be associated with the torus .",
    "this disk is located in approximately a north - south direction and may consist of an `` onion - skin '' morphology as discussed by pedlar et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in this model",
    "the gaseous torus contains several layers ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the innermost ring consists of ionized gas followed by a ring of neutral hi gas surrounded by a ring of molecular h@xmath86 . in pedlar s `` onion - skin '' model",
    "the authors further expand on the subject of anisotropy in ngc 4151 as discussed by penston et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . using observations of free - free absorption detected at 73 cm and 18 cm in conjunction with observations of hi by mundell et al . (",
    "1995 ) they estimate the ionizing flux incident on the torus . assuming a simple strmgren model they calculate that the ionizing flux in the plane of the torus is between @xmath8710 - 40 times less than seen from earth or @xmath87 100 - 500 times less than seen in the nlr as modelled by penston et al .",
    "( 1990 ) .    to test the validity of this model",
    "we can use the dust equilibrium equation from section 4.3 . given values for temperature and dust grain size discussed above we can calculate the size of the mid - ir torus as a function of ionizing luminosity , @xmath69 .",
    "color temperature measurements of the core of ngc  4151 show t @xmath88 k. if the dusty torus intercepts the ionizing luminosity as seen from earth @xmath73l@xmath81 and consists of dust grains similar to those estimated for the nlr ( @xmath82 @xmath0 graphite or @xmath83 @xmath1 sa silicate ) , the size of the torus in the mid - ir would be @xmath89 ( @xmath90 pc ) .",
    "this is slightly larger than the size of the torus based on our resolution limit of @xmath53 - @xmath38 ( @xmath4 pc ) and that of the ruiz polarimetry model ( @xmath84 30 pc ) .",
    "it is also 4 times larger than the north - south scans by n90 which measured the 11.2 @xmath1 emitting region to be 016@xmath1404 or @xmath52 pc . assuming the n90 mid - ir emission delineates the torus , dust grains in the torus would need to be @xmath8710  times larger than that found in the nlr . alternatively , if the luminosity in the plane of the torus is @xmath8710 - 40 @xmath91 less than seen from earth as modelled by pedlar et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the size of the torus in the mid - ir  would range between @xmath92 ( @xmath93 pc ) . although slightly smaller than the ruiz model , this size torus would be consistent with our upper limit as well as closely match the size measured by n90 .",
    "thus the `` onion - skin '' model of pedlar et al.(1998 ) which suggests that the luminosity in ngc  4151 may be very weak in the plane of the torus is roughly consistent with size estimates of the torus in the mid - ir .",
    "however , it should be noted that the results discussed above derive from simple equations involving strmgren radii and dust grains at equilibrium temperatures . due to the increased density of material associated with the torus",
    "as opposed to the nlr ,  a more robust radiative transfer analysis may be needed to truly understand the anisotropy in ngc4151 .",
