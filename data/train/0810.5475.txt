    "the outburst profile of x - ray accreting millisecond pulsars ( msps ) shows a decay similar to those of transient low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , i.e. exponential or linear decays , with also a distinct knee .",

    "the outburst light curve of   is completely different which have shown no exponential decays during the outburst @xcite . compared to other accreting msps with outburst periods of a few days to a month ,  shows evidence of being a `` quasi - persistent '' x - ray source during the long outburst period @xcite , and references therein .",
    "king & ritter ( 19989 ) ( henceforth kr ) and shahbaz , charles & king ( 1998 ) ( henceforth sck ) examined the x - ray light curves of transient lmxbs in decay , characterising them as simple exponential or linear decays . in some cases , however , the decays show a distinct knee .",
    "as shown e.g. in fig .",
    "[ fig:1808 ] for this is not a secondary maximum in the sense that the x - ray count rate declines throughout .    in x - ray bright disc - accreting systems ,",
    "including transient lmxbs during outburst , the temperature of the accretion disc is dominated by x - ray heating from the inner accretion regions across most of the disc . for a disc in which the scale height can be described as a function of radius by @xmath1 for constant @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the temperature , @xmath4 , is given by @xcite as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the disc albedo , @xmath7 is the central x - ray luminosity heating the disc , assumed to be emanating radially from a small spherical source . only if @xmath8 is the whole surface of the accretion disc illuminated ; if @xmath9 eq . ( [ eq : tofr ] ) predicts a surface temperature of zero which is invalid because of local viscous heat production .",
    "consistent with kr we adopt a value of @xmath10 , although see section _ modified exponential limit_. equation ( [ eq : tofr ] ) can be rewritten to give the maximum radius @xmath11 which is heated by x - rays to the temperature @xmath12 needed to remain in the hot , viscous state .",
    "thus @xmath13 we abbreviate this equation as @xmath14    kr showed that x - ray heating during the decay from outburst causes the light curves of transient lmxbs to exhibit either exponential or linear declines depending on whether or not the luminosity is sufficient to keep the outer disc edge hot .",
    "they note that exponential decays must revert to the linear mode when the x - ray flux has decreased sufficiently , but do not analyse this in detail . nor do they consider the effects of mass transfer from the donor star , @xmath15 , during the outburst . whilst in many systems @xmath15 is negligible compared to the mass accretion rate onto the compact object , @xmath16 , during outburst",
    ", this is not necessarily the case . in this proceeding",
    "i review the results of the msps pubblished in powell , haswell & falanga ( 2006 ) .",
    "the mass of the accretion disc during the exponential decay is given by equation ( 3 ) of kr ; @xmath17 where @xmath18 is some measure of viscosity , taken by kr to be the viscosity near the outer disc edge with a value of @xmath19 . in the case of significant mass transfer into the disc from the donor",
    "star the central accretion rate is given by @xmath20 using this to replace @xmath21 in ( [ eq : mdisc ] ) the mass of the hot disc can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the constant of integration , and the x - ray luminosity is proportional to @xmath24 at some time , @xmath25 , the temperature of the outer disc edge , while still dominated by x - ray heating , will be only just sufficient to remain in the hot , viscous state , i.e. @xmath26 .",
    "we denote the corresponding x - ray luminosity as @xmath27 , with the central accretion rate @xmath28 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity at earlier times is @xmath29 where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the efficiency with which rest mass is liberated as x - rays .      when @xmath32 the outer part of the disc is no longer kept in the hot , viscous state by central irradiation .",
    "the radius of the hot part of the disc will decrease with the decreasing x - ray luminosity , corresponding to the late linear decline of kr .",
    "this , too , may be modified by the donor star mass loss rate , depending on the mass accretion rate through the now cold outer disc . designating @xmath33 as the rate at which mass is transported inwards through the cold disc",
    ", we examine the two extreme behaviours of @xmath34 . for the minimally efficient cold disc @xmath35 for all @xmath36 , and",
    "none of @xmath15 reaches the hot disc when @xmath32 . at the other extreme @xmath37 and",
    "the cold disc does not increase in surface density with time .",
    "the occurrence of outbursts suggests that the latter case is false ; with stable cold - state mass transfer , outbursts would never occur .",
    "the mass in the hot disc changes due to three factors : accretion from its inner edge , the loss of material into the encroaching cold disc , and mass transfer from the cold disc . hence , @xmath38 using the approximate substitution from ( [ eq : rhotl ] ) that @xmath39 ( [ eq : mhotlin ] ) becomes @xmath40 additionally , equation ( 2 ) of kr allows @xmath41 to be written as @xmath42 equating ( [ eq : dmhotlin ] ) to @xmath43 ( [ eq : kr2 ] ) , @xmath44 so using equation ( 2 ) of kr , @xmath45 we now substitute the two cases of @xmath46 outlined above . when mass transfer into the hot disc is negligible , @xmath47 and the decay is the linear decline predicted by kr as expected . when @xmath48 , @xmath49 while @xmath50 this reduces to the same form .",
    "as @xmath16 decreases it will approach the limit of @xmath51 , at which point @xmath52 .",
    "the exact form of the decay will depend on the unreliably known form of @xmath33 , and during the late linear decline viscous heating near @xmath11 becomes non - negligible .",
    "we do not predict the form of the late decay other than to note that if there is some radius @xmath53 satisfying @xmath54 then the l.h.s . of ( [ eq : lqui ] )",
    "will give the asymptotic limit of the decay and the accretion luminosity at the beginning of quiescence .",
    "as a final point on the linear decay we note that the viscous instability may cause a range of annuli within the cold disc to enter the hot state and rapidly transfer mass inward",
    ". some of this may enter the inner hot disc , or else may increase the surface density of the subsequent cold disc such that the inner hot disc receives more material at its outer edge .",
    "consequently , small rebrightenings or other artefacts potentially complicate the linear decay .      to examine the observed x - ray light curves of transient lmxbs it is useful to examine the constraints on the transition .",
    "the gradient of the exponential decay at time @xmath25 is @xmath55 whilst the gradient of the linear decline is given by ( [ eq : ddmc ] ) , @xmath56 from ( [ eq : rhotl ] ) we adopt @xmath57 where it is assumed that at the outer disc edge @xmath58 .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath59 in the case that @xmath60 is small relative to @xmath7 the gradient of the exponential decay at time @xmath25 is equal to that of the subsequent linear decline ; the first derivative of the x - ray light curve is expected to vary smoothly throughout the decay .",
    "if however , @xmath60 can not be neglected then the linear decline is steeper than the exponential decay at @xmath25 and a discontinuity in gradient is expected . whether this is detectable depends on the value of @xmath15 and the quality of the x - ray data .    some x - ray light curves , including most of those discussed in this paper , include a knee feature in the decay from outburst .",
    "where this can be explained by an exponential to linear transition with non - negligible @xmath60 we label it as a ` brink ' . in general",
    "the decay light curve may contain multiple knees due to different effects , but we do not expect more than one brink unless the source rebrightens between them such that each occurs at approximately the same luminosity , corresponding to a disc not varying greatly in radius .",
    "the full source samples which fits the outburst decay light curves predicted with the model described above can be found in powell , haswell & falanga ( 2006 ) . here",
    "i report only the results of some of the msps sources .",
    "this work could be extended also to the msps igr j00291 + 5934 @xcite , xte j1814 - 338 @xcite , and swift j1756.9 - 2508 @xcite .",
    "we use our analysis to determine distances and accretion disc radii .",
    "system parameters from the literature for the objects analysed are collected in table  [ tab : syspar ] for comparison with quantities we derive .",

    "the count rates @xmath62 as a function of time @xmath63 were fitted with @xmath64 for the exponential phase , where @xmath65 is the limit of the exponential decay , @xmath66 is the count rate at the brink , and @xmath67 is the time - scale of the decay .",
    "the linear decline is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the time after the brink at which the count rate would become zero if the linear decline continued . using the assumed distance to each source with a hydrogen column density of @xmath70 it is possible to convert the count rates @xmath66 and @xmath65 into absolute x - ray luminosities @xmath27 and @xmath71 , the x - ray luminosity at the brink and the limit of the exponential decay ( corresponding to @xmath15 ) respectively .",

    "[ fig:1543 ] shows that the exponential - then - linear fit to the decay from the 2002 outburst of 4u 1543 - 475 is significantly better than the least - squares regression line . because no discontinuity is seen in the gradient , the fitting routine used was based on the continuous derivative model ( see section _ continuous derivative _ ) .",
    "previous outbursts were reported in 1971 , 1983 and 1992 .",
    "the source therefore spends only a small fraction of its time in outburst , suggesting that @xmath15 is small compared with the central accretion rate during outburst , consistent with the source s failure to display a broken gradient .",

    "hence it is expected that the ratio of @xmath15 to the peak central accretion rate is much higher than in 4u 1543 - 475 .",
    "this is consistent with the appearance of a broken decay in the two well observed outbursts , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:1808 ] and [ fig:1808_2002 ] .",
    "each light curve is well fitted by a decay that is exponential towards a positive limit followed by a sharp gradient discontinuity ( brink ) leading to a linear decline .",
    "the fit to the 1998 outburst includes all points that can be confirmed to occur during the decay ; the observation at day 16 of fig .",
    "[ fig:1808 ] may belong to a period of constant luminosity or even an unsteady rise to outburst , while the observations around day 33 of fig .",

    "[ fig:1808_2002 ] shows that the brink occurs at approximately the same count rate in both cases .",
    "this is expected if @xmath78 remains constant ( i.e. @xmath27 is the same ) .    the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:1808 ] indicates the fit proposed by sck , in which they identified the surplus around the brink as a secondary maximum .",
    "we disagree and view their fit as inadequate in having a negative limit to the exponential decay .",
    "it is possible that features in other decay light curves identified as secondary maxima but having monotonically decreasing x - ray flux have the same explanation .    a second issue in fig .",
    "[ fig:1808_2002 ] is the broken nature of the light curve prior to the brink . whilst we do not have a detailed explanation for this , we speculate that it may be associated with some regions of the disc being self - shadowed and initially remaining in the cool state .",
    "3d hydrodynamic simulations e.g. @xcite show self - shadowing is likely , due to spiral density waves and irradiated disc warping c.f .",
    "consequently the effective area of the hot disc , the quantity probably corresponding to our measurement of @xmath79 , increases during the decay in an apparently stepwise manner , introducing new material into the hot disc and therefore resetting the central luminosity to a higher value .",
    "this view is supported by the fact that fitting the region around day 65 of fig .",
    "[ fig:1808_2002 ] indicates a shorter exponential time - scale than from day 70 to the brink , corresponding to a smaller outer radius of the hot region . by day 70",
    "we assume that the entire disc is in the hot state .",
    "the growing irradiated area could lead to an actual increase in @xmath7 , hence it is an explanation for a type of secondary maximum .",
    "it is possible that the light curve will monotonically decline despite the growing irradiated area , hence producing knees in the light curve .",
    "the light curve of around day 67 of fig .  [ fig:1808_2002 ] is suggestive of this behaviour .",
    "xte  j1751 - 305 was first detected during its 2002 outburst , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1751 ] , and a second outburst was observed in 2005 .",
    "if this repetition interval is normal for the system , it indicates a ratio of @xmath15 to peak central accretion rate more similar to that of  than to 4u 1543 - 475 .",
    "consistent with this , the 2002 decay light curve has a shape similar to those of  in that a smooth exponential decay is broken by occasional rebrightenings .",
    "therefore only the last portion , appearing to correspond to a single smooth decay , is fitted .",
    "the linear portion of this decay terminates at a constant level . in accordance with ( [ eq : ddmc2 ] )",
    "we interpret this as the rate at which mass can be transferred through the mostly cold disc ; this rate will continue during quiescence whilst the disc mass increases .",
    "a third observed example of the brink is found in the only observed ( 2002 ) outburst of 0929 . here the overall shape before the brink is exponential , but a maximum at about day 10 of fig",
    ".  [ fig:0929 ] and a minimum at about day 19 are anomalous .",
    "possibly the outer edge of the disc remained cold until late in the exponential decay and several secondary maxima of the type already discussed have occurred .",
    "807  is , like , xte  j1751 - 305 and 0929 , one of eight known millisecond pulsar ( msp ) systems .",
    "msps have short orbital periods and hence small and therefore relatively simple discs .",
    "we therefore expect the x - ray light curve of 807  to also display the brinked decay seen in the first three .",
    "[ fig:1807 ] does not appear to lend itself to this type of fitting , and we have been unable to obtain reasonable fitting parameters .",
    "one possible explanation is that the linear decay had already begun at the start of the observed light curve ; in this case the brink count rate must be around fifty per cent greater than that seen in .",
    "the orbital separation of 807 ( c.f . table  [ tab : syspar ] ) is half that of , so the disc must be correspondingly smaller . a high value of @xmath66 can only be accounted for if 807  is at a distance of less than about @xmath80 so the luminosity remains low while the countrate is high .",
    "conversely , if the light curve corresponds to the exponential portion with several rebrightenings , the maximum value of @xmath66 may be 15 , with the light curve after day 80 tentatively assumed to be linear .",
    "if the disc is half the radius of that of , in proportion to the orbital separation , ( [ eq : dmhotlin ] ) indicates that the brink luminosity will be one quarter that of .",
    "the pca count rate at the proposed brink is one quarter that of , indicating a similar source distance of @xmath81 .",
    "we deem the latter explanation more likely , and suspect that the exponential decay of 807  is complicated by self - shadowing of the disc .",
    "the more extreme mass ratio of 807  than , indicated in table  [ tab : syspar ] , suggests that the accretion disc radius in 807  is a larger fraction of the orbital separation , indicating a larger brink luminosity than assumed above , increasing the distance estimates in both cases . a lower value of @xmath66 is possible in the second case , which would also indicate a greater source distance .",
    "to force the disc radii based on @xmath67 to lie within the range @xmath82 for the two best described systems ,  and 0929 the viscosity of @xmath83 was adopted , close to the value of @xmath84 proposed by kr . to make @xmath85 consistent with @xmath86 for most of the neutron star systems a value of @xmath87 was adopted .",
    "since @xmath88 is based on @xmath89 , our systematic underestimate of @xmath27 by considering only the flux in the 1.512@xmath72 band suggests a yet smaller value of @xmath76 .",
    "calculated disc radii using these parameter values are given in table  [ tab : calcpar ] .",
    "the large value of @xmath85 for xte  j1751 - 305 may be the result of spectral differences , or in this case may be the result of an erroneous source distance estimate .",
    "xte  j1751 - 305 has been assumed to lie at a distance of @xmath90 , being possibly associated with the galactic centre ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; if the true distance is more like @xmath91 then the two values of @xmath78 will be approximately equal .",
    "the increasing value of @xmath86 for the 2002 decay of  and the erratically increasing luminosity between days 65 and 70 of fig .",
    "[ fig:1808_2002 ] are both consistent with the interpretation that the outer disc edge was not in the hot state at the beginning of the decay . as such , the disc radius measured corresponds at first to a hot disc smaller than the disc as a whole , which is therefore depleted on a shorter timescale . at some point",
    "the outer disc is heated and enters the hot state . as well as",
    "increasing the timescale of the decay , this introduces extra material into the hot disc , causing rebrightening .",
    "we have assumed in the initial model that the limit of the exponential decay is equal to the assumed constant mass transfer rate from the donor star .",
    "this requires that the hot disc is capable of supporting the additional mass flux @xmath15 at all times and radii .",
    "however , the exponential nature of the decay itself implies that as the hot disc is depleted in surface density , its mass transfer rate falls .",
    "the mass transfer equation of the hot disc is linear in surface density , which can therefore be decomposed into two components ; one representing the decay analogous to an unfed disc , the other corresponding to the effects of feeding the hot disc at the rate @xmath15 .",
    "the former component we denote @xmath92 and the latter @xmath93 .",
    "because the viscosity of the accretion disc depends on temperature , and the temperature is declining during the decay , it is necessary for @xmath93 to increase with time if it is to sustain the same mass flux , implying that the corresponding flux @xmath94 must decrease inwards .",
    "thus the limit of the central mass accretion rate does not correspond to @xmath15 , but rather @xmath95 .",
    "the relevance of this issue is made clear by the light curves of 4u  1705 - 44 , in which the limit of the exponential decay is often below the long term mean count rate of @xmath96 asm counts @xmath97 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the standard derivation of the diffusion equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be used to give the mass transfer rate inward through the disc @xmath98 as @xmath99 using the relation @xmath100 we derive equation ( 9 ) of @xcite as expected .",
    "we require the form given in ( [ eq : mu ] ) to prevent a constant of integration arising .    to make use of ( [ eq : mu ] ) we must adopt an appropriate form for the viscosity @xmath101 .",
    "we use the @xmath102-viscosity form @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the sound speed , and the scale height is given by equation ( 2 ) of @xcite ; @xmath105 using ( [ eq : tofr ] ) to substitute for @xmath4 and assuming that @xmath106 is a power law we obtain @xmath107 for a mean particle mass @xmath108 .",
    "we write ( [ eq : hpower ] ) in terms of constant @xmath2 as @xmath109 where @xmath10 is derived and @xmath110 is adopted from kr .",
    "@xcite note that if the x - ray flux is assumed to be absorbed at the mid - plane , the power law index is changed to @xmath111 ; we therefore consider values of @xmath112 as valid to simplify subsequent derivation . using this form for @xmath113 in ( [ eq : tofr ] ) to derive the viscosity we find that @xmath114 where @xmath115 is defined as @xmath116 we simplify ( [ eq : nu ] ) by adopting @xmath117 , so ( [ eq : mu ] ) becomes @xmath118 if we impose @xmath119 for all radii we obtain @xmath120 corresponding to a total contribution to mass in the hot disc of @xmath121 where the radius of the inner disc edge is much smaller than @xmath88 .",

    "it is necessary to simultaneously derive the time and radius dependencies of @xmath98 given the outer boundary condition of @xmath132 .",
    "a knee in the light curve of the decay from outburst of an transient lmxb is a natural consequence of mass transfer onto the outer edge of the disc , since this supply is effectively cut off from the compact object when the outer disc enters the cool low - viscosity state .",
    "when the knee can be interpreted in this way we refer to it as a brink , since knees of other types may be seen in the decay outburst .",
    "the x - ray luminosity at which the brink occurs is that at which the outer disc edge is just kept hot by central illumination , allowing this radius to be calculated .",
    "in addition , the exponential time - scale of the decay gives a second measure of the disc radius ; these two estimates are in good agreement . by examining systems with well constrained disc radii we deduced values of the constants @xmath76 and @xmath18 required to perform the calculations .",
    "this allows more accurate results to be obtained in other systems .",
    "where the source distance is poorly constrained , the timescale @xmath67 allows the absolute luminosity @xmath27 to be estimated , providing a measure of source distance .    as well as `",
    "secondary maxima ' associated with the brink , we have identified maxima whose natural explanation is the discontinuous increase in the radius of the hot disc during outburst .",
    "this increase arises from initially self - shadowed disc regions becoming irradiated .",
    "this process can occur until the whole disc is in the hot state .",
    "it is characteristic for the time - scale of the exponential decay to increase with each such maximum , and it is expected that the limit of each exponential decay will also increase .",
    "although we do not have sufficient data to examine the matter in detail , it is probable that some secondary ` maxima ' of this type will also involve monotonic decay , and therefore probably will appear as a knee in the x - ray light curve .",
    "current instrumentation is capable of measuring the light curves of x - ray transients in m31 , for example @xcite show part of a 2004 july decay of xmm  j004315.5 + 412440 .",
    "while this light curve , with only 4 data points over 3 consecutive days , is too sparse to allow us to deduce any parameters from fitting the decay , our method could be applied to better - sampled extragalactic transient decays .",
    "since the distance is relatively well - known for objects in external galaxies , we could use our method to deduce their accretion disc radii . this would contribute to constraints on the fundamental system parameters , such as orbital separation and mass ratio , which might otherwise be impossible to determine .",
