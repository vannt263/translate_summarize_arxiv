    "it is well known that fracture propagation is strongly governed by properties of the surface created .",
    "the classical griffith criterion requires that for a crack to propagate all the elastic energy supplied to the crack tip must at least match the work of surface creation .",
    "crack speed is more complicated : one needs to understand the energetics of mechanisms in competition with surface work , and in this paper we focus on phonon emission .",
    "phonon emission from the crack tip involves both bulk and surface waves . in the continuum limit",
    "these waves are dispersionless and emission is only expected when the crack speed matches any of the speeds @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 of longitudinal , transverse and rayleigh ( surface ) waves . the rayleigh speed being the lowest , it is often regarded as the ultimate theoretical limit for the speed of crack propagation .",
    "real materials however have properties that do not match the continuum theory .",
    "one famous example of this is the existence of forbidden crack speeds , which was first explained by m.  marder _ _ et al.__@xcite taking into account the discrete nature of matter .",
    "their qualitative explanation of the _ velocity gap _ where no crack can propagate in a periodic lattice at speeds lower than roughly @xmath3 of the transverse waves speed , was related to lattice oscillations breaking bonds before the expected time compatible with the crack speed .",
    "this explanation involves the use of a `` most stretched bond '' breakage rule .",
    "here we propose a more cautious but general view using an approach based on the phonon band structure and the energy release rate .",
    "the phonon band structure can lead to resonant emissions which influence the fraction of energy radiated from the crack tip .",
    "the existence of forbidden crack speeds then follows .",
    "when dealing with dispersion relations the reference is usually to bulk waves or , in the case of surface waves , to the rayleigh branch responsible for the rayleigh speed .",
    "geophysicists and researchers in earthquakes are also familiar with another kind of surface waves known as love waves@xcite , polarized in the direction normal to that of propagation and parallel to the crack plane .",
    "love waves only exist in the continuum limit when there is a gradation of elastic properties near the surface , pertinent to seismology but not usually considered in fracture mechanics .",
    "however , due to the discrete nature of matter at the atomic level dispersive media can also support love and other wave branches so that they can enter fracture problems .",
    "it is natural to include the whole complexity of the surface dispersion relations in the description of the material to understand its role , and how and if this complexity can change the theoretical description of fracture dynamics .",
    "the form of dispersion relations is the fingerprint of the discrete spatial organization of matter , beyond the continuum limit . in any kind of simulation",
    "it is necessary to deal with discretization in space . in molecular dynamic simulations@xcite",
    "this corresponds to an atomistic description ; in mesoscopic models as lattice - like@xcite or finite element models@xcite , discretization has to be imposed in space in order to solve differential equations of the dynamics .",
    "this has an unavoidable effect on the dispersion relations that necessarily reflect the underlying lattice .",
    "in this paper we present a new model developed to simulate an elastic continuum material using finite tetrahedral elements .",
    "space is discretized on an fcc grid , and this is reflected in the dispersion relations of the simulated material .",
    "this feature could be considered a drawback , but can be exploited to model the influence of similar dispersions in real fcc structure materials .",
    "the simplicity of the model allows us an extensive understanding of both simulations and theory .",
    "the model , built to allow fast and very large three dimensional simulations , is used here in the simplified case of two dimensional samples , and phonon emission from the crack surface of planar cracks advancing at fixed speeds is analysed .",
    "an analysis of the influence of this emission on the crack dynamics is the aim of this work .",
    "new and central to our approach is that we fix the crack properties ( speed and shape ) and measure some of the mechanical properties ( stress , energy release rate ) .",
    "this can be done with success in two - dimensions and gives new insight into the behaviour of some of these quantities . in particular",
    ", we show that the energy release rate is strongly influenced by the surface phonon emission at the crack tip through resonant emission at particular crack speeds , leading to the existence of narrow bands of permitted crack speed .",
    "we also show that the energy release rate which enters the griffith criterion can be expressed as the continuum solution , multiplied by a microscopic function that only depends on the lattice geometry and that describes the lattice influence on the phonon emission .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii a full description of the model is provided , including the description of the bulk dispersion relations . in section iii , a preliminary analysis of simulations of planar cracks at constant speed is given , and in section iv we relate the phonon emission to the dispersion relations of surface waves and we show the phenomenon of resonances . in section",
    "v we analyse how the energy release rate is influenced by the phonon emission and we derive the existence of bands of permitted crack speeds .",
    "finally , conclusions and comparison with other works are given in section vi .",
    "the model is an application of the finite element method with the aim of simulating linear elasticity and fractures . in continuum",

    "the key driving features of the model are that the elastic response is as local as possible so that non - linearity and particularly rupture can be incorporated , whilst accidental soft modes are avoided and all mode frequencies are strictly upper bounded for stability of timestepping .      to evaluate the unsymmetrized strain tensor , space is discretized using an fcc lattice and lattice points",
    "are connected using tetrahedral elements .",

    "[ fig : fcclattice - tet ] ) , which is the minimum for a full local gradient calculation in three dimensions . on each lattice point",
    ", the displacement field @xmath7 is defined , and the lagrangian in its discretized form is given by : @xmath8    where the @xmath9 index spans over all lattice points and the @xmath10 index spans all the tetrahedral elements .",
    "@xmath11 is the volume of the system per tetrahedron , @xmath12 of the volume of the fcc conventional unit cell shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcclattice - tet ] .",
    "the stress tensor is evaluated at the center of each tetrahedron through ( [ eq : stress - strain ] ) , given the unsymmetrized strain tensor at the center of the @xmath10-th tetrahedron is : @xmath13    with the condition @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the vector joining the center of the @xmath10-th tetrahedron with neighbouring vertex site @xmath9 , and @xmath16 is the displacement field on site @xmath9 .",

    "this equation can be solved exactly for eigenvalues ( see appendix [ app : bulk - waves ] ) , giving the results shown graphically in figure [ fig : fcclattice - disp - rel ] .",
    "the dispersion curves are well behaved , and reflect the underlying fcc structure : even if we are trying to simulate the continuum limit , dispersion relations are the image of the spatial structure of the underlying lattice .",
    "this can not be avoided in our model just as in real materials .",
    "the dispersion relations found vindicate the use of tetrahedral elements . using a simpler cubic lattice and cubic finite elements leads to unphysical soft modes , where the frequency goes to zero whenever two of the three components of the @xmath28 vector approach the border of the brillouin zone .",
    "the use of tetrahedra removes this problem since there is no way to deform a tetrahedron giving a null contribution to the strain tensor , whilst alternative strategies involving less local spatial derivatives make fracture properties harder to implement and control .",
    "the value of the maximum frequency is set by the longitudinal branch at the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "we will see in section [ sec : maxfreq ] that such a value remains an upper bound even when considering the finiteness of the sample or the presence of fractures .",
    "this value provides the minimum period of site motion .    due to the significant role of surface waves in this paper , a study on their dispersion relations",

    "the continuous time dispersion relations have the simple form @xmath38    with : @xmath39 . comparing ( [ eq : disp - h ] ) and ( [ eq : disp-1d ] ) , it is easy to observe that the stability limit for the timestep is @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , if we use exactly this value for the timestep , we obtain the linear dispersion relation @xmath41 with @xmath42 . thus using the maximum allowed timestep ,",
    "the relation between the frequency and the wave vector is the same as in continuum elasticity .",
    "this notable property is valid only in one dimension and is lost in two and three dimensions where the dispersion is more rich .",
    "nevertheless , this property shows that having discretized space , it not necessarily an optimal approximation to the continuum to use a very small timestep as in standard molecular dynamics simulations .    in three dimensions @xmath43 is given by the maximum frequency over the entire first brillouin zone . using the maximum allowed timestep dispersion relations are closer but not equivalent to the continuum limit .    the leap - frog scheme used here to discretize",
    "time is relatively robust with respect to energy conservation due to its time reveribility and symplectic properties.@xcite there is an exactly conserved @xmath29-dependent hamiltonian @xmath44 very close to the nave one@xcite , with for example : @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the kinetic energies advanced and retarded by @xmath48 relative to the timestep where the potential energy @xmath49 is evaluated .    in these simulations",

    "have been performed showing no substantial difference with the results here reported .",
    "the model up to now has been described as a model for linear elasticity . however , since the link between the stress and the strain tensor is given exclusively through equation ( [ eq : stress - strain ] ) , we can easily generalize the equation to include any kind of elastic response as well as anisotropies .",
    "for instance : @xmath52    where each tensor component @xmath53 represents any kind of nonlinear function . in this paper",
    "we study only the simpler scenario of linear elasticity augmented by breakage of tetrahedra corresponding to the advance of the crack .",
    "we brake tetrahedra by abruptly setting its elastic constants @xmath54 and @xmath55 to zero and it is the resulting recoil of the neighbouring sites which excites phonon emission .    breaking tetrahedra does not compromise the maximum allowed timestep , because we can readily show that the maximum vibrational frequency can not increase . to see this consider eq .",

    "an advancing crack is simulated through the breaking of tetrahedra .",
    "to decide when to break we need a _",
    "breakage rule_. one possibility is to break tetrahedra as soon as they overcome some fracture criterion , for example a critical value of principal stress or elastic energy . in this work",
    "we instead follow a complementary approach , advancing a straight crack at constant speed and measuring the fracture criteria achieved such as work of fracture .",
    "this provides new insight into the relationship between energy release rate and crack speed , including any intervals of forbidden velocities .",
    "for computational convenience we focussed on crack speeds commensurate with our timestep , that is    @xmath62    for @xmath63 .",
    "any desired crack speed can be obtained from this sequence by modest adjustment of the timestep @xmath29 .",
    "the model presented above is fully three dimensional .",
    "however for a strictly planar type - i crack , commensurate with our lattice , it is readily shown that the resulting dynamical solution is strictly planar with the displacement all in that plane .",
    "we have exploited this and shrunk our system to one fcc cell deep in the third dimension , with periodic boundary conditions .    in our simulations the lam coefficients",
    "are set so that the poisson ratio is @xmath64 .",
    "the boundary conditions correspond to imposing fixed normal counter displacement at the top and bottom boundaries , i.  e.  @xmath65 , @xmath66 at @xmath67 , and @xmath68 on the right and left faces ( see fig .",

    "the description of the modes in which a lattice with an underlying fcc symmetry can vibrate is more complex than the one given by continuum elasticity .",
    "frequency as a function of wave vector is no longer linear , and becomes periodic in the extended zone scheme .",
    "moreover , new branches of surface wave appear besides the continuum rayleigh branch .",

    "however we observe ( not surprisingly ) that signal corresponding to resonances in higher brillouin zones is weak , so our discussion in this paper focuses on the first two brillouin zones only .",

    "the presence of resonances suggests that an effect on the crack dynamics has to be expected .",
    "we will now show how the most commonly and relevant measured quantity of crack dynamics , namely the _ energy release rate _",
    ", is affected by this phenomenon .    in the simulations here reported",
    ", a planar crack is left to advance at constant speed from a short starting notch . at early times",
    "the crack is almost equivalent to a crack advancing in an unbounded medium , since the sample boundaries are distant from the crack tip .",
    "when the crack becomes large compared to the linear dimensions of the sample the crack starts to `` feel '' the presence of the boundaries and the correct description is that of a crack advancing in a strip . in the continuum and steady limit the short crack regime",
    "is characterized by a linear increase of the energy release rate @xmath87 with time , whilst in the long crack regime the @xmath87 function is time - independent .",
    "both regimes are sensitive to the crack speed .      the discrete nature of matter is reflected in the dependence of the energy release rate @xmath87 on crack speed .",
    "we can describe the macroscopic energy release rate per unit distance of crack advance @xmath88 as the sum of two contributions : @xmath89    @xmath90 is the solution of the continuum limit which governs the macroscopic delivery of energy towards the crack tip , for which we have theoretical expressions available . @xmath91 and @xmath92 are respectively the breakage energy release rate and the phonon energy release rate . our strategy below is to directly measure the breakage energy release rate from the potential energy lost when tetrahedra are broken .",
    "the macroscopic energy release rate @xmath90 is largely determined by the macroscopic conditions and the length of the crack . in the long crack limit in the case of a strip of height @xmath93 and fixed displacement @xmath94 at each boundary",
    ", the macroscopic energy release rate corresponds to the amount of elastic energy stored far ahead of the crack tip@xcite . from eq.([eq : stress - strain ] ) the stress field ahead of the crack tip has @xmath95        the translation of the griffith criterion in the discrete case is that the crack will advance as soon as the energy stored in the tetrahedron to break , @xmath98 , is greater than a threshold value connected with the toughness of the material .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath98 with the crack speed is therefore crucial for understanding the crack dynamics .      where we have introduced the _ efficiency _ @xmath100 . in the long crack limit for the fixed grip set - up used in our simulations this gives @xmath101 where the efficiency is the sole source of velocity dependence .",
    "the effect of local discreteness thus separates from the effect of macroscopic external conditions : all the dependence on the crack speed is hidden in the efficiency function @xmath100 which is local to the crack tip region and independent of the macroscopic regime as will be shown below .",
    "the meaning of the efficiency @xmath100 is as follows : when @xmath100 is close to zero , the energy delivered to the crack tip is mostly spent in phonon emission so that the mechanism is not sufficient for the crack to advance .",
    "when the @xmath100 is close to one , all the energy delivered is used to break tetrahedra , and the crack can advance promptly .",
    "we will see that the dependence on @xmath9 is crucial in the determination of bands of permitted crack speeds , not described in the continuum elastic theory .",
    "the correct derivation of these bands will be given below .",

    "vertical lines indicate the speeds at which resonances are expected to be seen according to figure [ fig : surf - phenom ] .",
    "the two lines labelled as @xmath106 and @xmath107 correspond to resonances due to the dispersion relations of _ bulk waves_. corresponding to each line there is a clear decrease of the energy release rate , meaning that more energy is emitted as radiation .",
    "the crucial feature of figure [ fig : g - resonances ] is that it reveals how the energy available for breaking bonds responds to the speed of the crack , for a given macroscopic energy release rate .",
    "this same figure can be read in reverse : given some threshold value for @xmath105 corresponding to a given fracture toughness of the material , the possible crack speeds are obtained from the graph .",
    "it can be further argued on grounds of stability that only the speed ranges where @xmath105 decreases with @xmath9 are allowed as steady crack speeds . in the counter case where @xmath105 increases with @xmath9 ,",
    "a prospective overshoot in @xmath9 leads to excessive bond breakage energy and hence acceleration , and an undershoot to insufficient breakage energy and the crack must slow further .",
    "thus stable steady crack propagation is confined to narrow intervals associated with resonances and the high speed regime .",
    "it is worth pointing out that most of the features shown in figure [ fig : g - resonances ] are due to high frequency branches either in the first or second brillouin zone .",

    ", we also analyzed the short crack limit . in this case , the crack can be seen as advancing in an unbounded medium as the sample boundaries are distant from the crack tip . for a planar type - i crack propagating at steady speed @xmath9 in an unbounded continuum medium the macroscopic transfer of energy to the crack tip ( per unit distance advanced )",

    "@xmath116 has the form :            matches @xmath100 already measured from the long crack limit .",
    "simulations of symmetric crack growth can be performed simply by fixing the longitudinal displacement at the left and right boundaries : though this would correspond to having a periodic system of symmetric growing cracks , the interaction between cracks is weak due to the strip geometry .",
    "@xmath104 then corresponds to the measured slopes of the early regime , and @xmath123 is the time derivative of the macroscopic energy release rate ( [ eq : g - unbounded ] ) .",
    "results of the comparison are reported in table [ tab : tab1 ] . because the product @xmath125 corresponds to the crack length , the case @xmath126",
    "was reconstructed by analysing several simulations of static cracks with different crack lengths and retrieving the resulting overall slope . for low and high crack speeds ,",
    "problems arise when measuring the short crack regime : for low crack speeds data is noisy and there are few points to average ; for high crack speeds the long crack limit is achieved soon after the crack starts moving , so that the short crack regime is properly defined only when the sample height is very large with respect to the size of a tetrahedron .",
    "this is still not the case even when dealing with our @xmath102 tetrahedra wide sample .",
    "better results for the short crack regime were obtained from simulations of @xmath127 tetrahedra as the third column of the table shows .",
    "these results show that the efficiency @xmath100 is independent of the particular dynamic regime .",
    "the absolute values are also of interest .",
    "the @xmath126 limit shows that when the tetrahedra at the tip of a static crack are broken , about @xmath128 of the strain energy released comes from relaxation in other tetrahedra which is radiated in waves . the maximum efficiency ( about @xmath129 )",
    "occurs at @xmath130 .",
    "this happens to be just below the yoffe speed @xmath131 , but as our measurements exclude the possibility of crack branching we presume this to be a coincidence .",
    "we have presented a new finite element model for linear elastic fracture mechanics , which has proved surprisingly and revealingly rich in its behaviour even in the two dimensional case .",
    "the model was designed to enable fast numerical simulations of large systems particularly with three dimensions in mind , but the main strengths which we have exploited in this paper are direct control of the local physics which it offers , combined with bulk and surface dispersion relations amenable to simple theoretical computation .",
    "our results suggest that inclusion of known phonon dispersion can be crucial to understanding the speed of fracture propagation .",
    "our results relate to ideally brittle materials , in that we have included no significant mechanism of local dissipation and most particularly no plastic deformation mechanism .",
    "linear damping is readily included , and indeed could be exploited to mitigate the effects of waves reflected back from the sample edges .",
    "spontaneous crack roughness and branching will be addressed in a following paper .",
    "the crucial mechanism which our results incorporate beyond continuum fracture mechanics is the radiation of phonons from the crack tip .",
    "this we show leads to a significant speed dependence in the fraction of macroscopic strain energy available as work to create new surface . for a static crack in our model ,",
    "this efficiency is only @xmath132 , thus modifying the most nave griffith criterion for crack propagation by a factor of @xmath133 .",
    "the general rise in bond breaking efficiency with speed towards a global maximum for typical fast crack speeds rules out steady crack propagation at most lower speeds , and remains to be understood more quantitatively .",
    "we have been able to interpret fine structure in the bond breaking efficiency associated with resonant conditions for surface wave emission .",
    "this leads to islands of stable crack velocity , which can only arise at lower speeds due to dispersion and hence due to the discrete properties of matter .    a related explanation of the presence of sets of forbidden crack speeds has already been given by m.  marder _ _ et al.__@xcite by using a mechanistic description of bond breakage in terms of most stretched ones .",
    "according to this approach cracks can not advance at speeds below some threshold , since due to lattice oscillations bonds would break before the expected time compatible with the crack speed .",
    "a velocity gap then appears .",
    "the two approaches seem to be very close indeed , since simulations from murder _ et al . _",
    "are based on periodic lattices which should show characteristic dispersion relations .",
    "the oscillations between neighbouring sites which stretch the bonds beyond the critical length correspond to wave vectors at the border of the brillouin zone and ideally should be connected to the presence of resonances towards the zone boundary .",
    "our description however appears to be more general as it expresses the same phenomenon in terms of the energy release rate and phonon band structure .",
    "the existence of velocity gaps is shown on the basis of energetic arguments .",
    "this has the advantage of not being built up on the particular rule for breaking bonds , but relates the existence of velocity gaps and constant speed advance to a more general description of the properties of the material .",
    "furthermore , velocity gaps can be read directly from the dependence of the strain energy release rate on the crack speed , a relationship which we might eventually hope to deduce or calculate for real materials .",
    "we can now multiply eq .",
    "( [ eq : tetmod - dis - first ] ) by @xmath136 to the left and by @xmath137 to the right , so as to obtain the following coupled equations : @xmath139 & = & \\beta [ 2b\\eta + c(1+|\\eta|^2)]\\\\    & & \\\\ ( \\epsilon - 1 ) [ b + c\\eta^ * ] & = & \\beta [ b(1+|\\eta|^2 ) + 2c\\eta^ * ] \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]",
    "there are at least two pratical reasons to add dissipation in the dynamics .",
    "first , the starting point of any simulation should be a sample in equilibrium : this can be easily obtained by relaxing the lattice to a configuration of minimum energy .",
    "the second reason is the possibility to damp out waves that would otherwise propagate and reflect back from the sample borders .",
    "the physical way to introduce dissipation in the model for linear elasticity is the introduction of a viscosity term in ( [ eq : rho - sigma ] ) .",
    "however this gives wide dispersion in the damping rates of different modes making it inefficient at relaxing solutions or reducing boundary reflections .",
    "there is a less physical way to obtain dissipation that has the advantage of being less wave vector dependent and simpler to implement .",
    "starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion - model ] ) a dissipative term is added so that : @xmath146          @xmath150 }              \\bigg\\ } = \\\\     &    & \\\\     &    & \\hspace{-1 cm } = \\left\\ {   \\begin{array}{l c c c c } \\gamma &    & \\frac{\\textrm{g ( } { \\bf k } \\textrm { ) } } { m } & \\geq & \\gamma^2\\\\         &    &           &       & \\\\ \\left\\ {    \\begin{array}{l l } 2 \\gamma - \\frac{1}{2 \\gamma }            \\bigg[\\frac{\\textrm{g ( } { \\bf k } \\textrm { ) } } { m } \\bigg ]    &   \\begin{array}{l } \\textrm{\\small{fast}}\\\\ \\textrm{\\small{modes } } \\end{array}\\\\    &",

    "[ fig : disp - rel ] the damping rate @xmath151 is plotted as a function of @xmath152 .",
    "curves depend on the value of the dissipative parameter @xmath153 : in particular , the value @xmath154 separates two regimes . for @xmath155",
    "all the modes are damped with a damping constant @xmath156 , whereas for @xmath157 fast and slow modes are damped with different magnitudes .",
    "the optimal value for @xmath153 is then set by maximising the damping rate of the slowest mode , leading us to set @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the size of the lattice in fcc unit cells .",
    "the choice is also interesting in that it sets all modes to have the same damping rate @xmath160      during the dynamics , reflected waves travel a distance of at least @xmath159 fcc unit cells in a time interval of @xmath162 , hence when reflected waves reach the crack tip , using the optimal value for @xmath153 their intensity is reduced at least by a factor @xmath163 for transverse waves , and @xmath164 for longitudinal waves , using values as in figure [ fig : fcclattice - disp - rel ] .",
    "note however that for the results presented in this paper we turned all damping off after initial equilibration ."
