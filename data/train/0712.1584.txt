    "the charmonium model is a phenomenological model describing the bound state of the charm and anti - charm quark system @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_1 ] demonstrates the correspondence between experiment and theory of the charmonium spectrum for two selected models @xcite .",
    "the dashed lines illustrate theoretically predicted masses , overlaid with black solid lines indicating the well - established experimental results , and red and blue solid lines for recently discovered resonances yet to be incorporated into the model . in the case of the well - established states",
    ", there is very good agreement between the theory and experiment .",
    "the series of newly discovered charmonium - like states will be the primary focus of this talk .",
    "i will concentrate on results obtained at the babar and belle @xmath1-factories .",
    "the babar results are based on @xmath5 fb@xmath6 of @xmath7 collisions at the @xmath8 resonance ( @xmath9 gev ) at the pep - ii linear accelerator at slac .",
    "the belle results are from up to @xmath10 fb@xmath6 of the same type of collisions at the kek - b accelerator at kek .",
    "in 2003 , belle discovered a signal in the decay @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this state was found to have a mass of @xmath13 mev@xmath4 and a very narrow width , @xmath14 mev .",
    "this discovery was later verified by cdf , d0 , and babar @xcite .",
    "evidence for @xmath15 determines c - parity to be positive @xcite .",
    "angular analyses from belle and cdf @xcite favour @xmath16 .",
    "no charged partners of the @xmath2 have been found , and decays to @xmath17 and @xmath18 have not been seen .",
    "the @xmath2 displays some characteristics of a charmonium - like state , but its narrow width above the @xmath19 threshold , mass , and quantum numbers do not correspond with charmonium model predictions .",
    "it is important to consider @xmath20 , leading to speculation that the @xmath2 may be the bound state of two @xmath21 mesons , i.e. a @xmath22 molecule .",
    "this is supported by predictions for its mass , decay modes , @xmath23 values , and branching fractions .",
    "other more exotic interpretations include tetraquark , glueball , or charmonium - gluon hybrid bound states . for a summary of theoretical interpretations of the @xmath2 ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "belle has discovered three more charmonium - like states in a similar mass range via distinct production methods and decay modes .",
    "all three states have plausible charmonium model interpretations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 was discovered by the recoil of the @xmath27 in the double - charmonium production of @xmath28 on 350 fb@xmath6 of data @xcite .",
    "it was found to decay to @xmath29 but not @xmath30 .",
    "this points towards an assignment as the @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath25 was seen in the decay @xmath32 , @xmath33 . in belle",
    "s dataset of 278 m @xmath1 decays , they measured a mass and width of @xmath34 mev@xmath4 and @xmath35 mev @xcite .",
    "this state was confirmed by babar @xcite , but using 385 m @xmath1 decays they measured it to have a mass and width of @xmath36 mev@xmath4 and @xmath37 mev .",
    "an apparent interpretation of the @xmath25 state is the @xmath38 charmonium state .    finally , using 395 fb@xmath6 of data ,",
    "the @xmath39 was found by belle in the two - photon process @xmath40 and decaying to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath41 charmonium assignment is an eminent choice based on its production , decay , mass , and width .",
    "several new states have been discovered via initial - state - radiation production .",
    "the first of these was babar s discovery @xcite of a broad structure in the decay @xmath42 , @xmath43 . based on 211 fb@xmath6 of data ,",
    "the mass and width of this bump were measured to be @xmath44 mev@xmath4 and @xmath45 .",
    "following this discovery , cleo performed a centre - of - mass energy scan and collected data directly at the @xmath46 resonance @xcite . reconstructing 16 decay modes , they confirmed babar s discovery as well as finding evidence for @xmath47 and @xmath48 . using 550 fb@xmath6 of data ,",
    "belle has also confirmed babar s discovery @xcite , measuring a mass of @xmath49 mev@xmath4 and a width of @xmath50 mev .",
    "additionally , belle claims a second much broader resonance at @xmath51 mev@xmath4 with a width of @xmath52 mev .",
    "because these states are produced in the annihilation of @xmath7 , they necessarily have @xmath53 .",
    "however , all of the @xmath54 charmonium states have already been accounted for .",
    "this difficulty was compounded when babar s search for an accompanying @xmath55 decay with 298 fb@xmath6 of data turned up a structure at a higher mass that is incompatible with the @xmath46 .",
    "this new state was found to have a mass of @xmath56 mev@xmath4 and a width of @xmath57 mev @xcite .",
    "belle confirmed this discovery on 670 fb@xmath6 of data , measuring @xmath58 mev@xmath4 with a width of @xmath59 mev , while finding further evidence for a higher resonance with a mass of @xmath60 mev@xmath4 and width of @xmath61 mev @xcite .",
    "these findings now overpopulate @xmath54 by four states , making it impossible to explain these resonances within the charmonium model .",
    "the charmonium model has had great success , but recent experimental results from the @xmath1-factories is challenging our understanding of the strong force .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath2 is not a charmonium state ; it is likely a @xmath22 molecule .",
    "the nature of the isr - produced @xmath54 states is unclear .",
    "going beyond the charmonium model , lattice qcd and nrqcd will begin to take the lead in the search for a theoretical interpretation . on the experimental front",
    ", the babar , belle , and cleo experiments will remain operational through 2008 , followed by the upgraded bes - iii thereafter . in the longer term , a super @xmath1-factory collaboration offers the possibility of more than an order of magnitude increase in data .",
    "this is indeed a very exciting time in the field of quarkonium physics .",
