    "coherent optical fiber links are the most precise technique to transfer time and frequency signals or to compare remote frequency standards , @xcite as they improve by more than four orders of magnitude the resolution of current satellite techniques @xcite .",
    "thus , they are a key technology both for science and metrology , allowing for different outstanding applications . + presently , optical links are the only viable method for optical clocks comparison .",
    "this is a prerequisite for an effective secondary representation of the second in the international system of units @xcite , as recommended by the confrence gnrale des poids et mesures , and for the possible redefinition of the second itself .",
    "+ even cs fountains , presently the best realizations of the si second , could benefit from optical fiber links as an alternative to satellite techniques @xcite .",
    "in fact , optical links would reduce by a factor 20 the measuring time needed to compare primary standards at their accuracy level .",
    "+ moreover , optical links pave the way for a network of accurate clocks .",
    "for instance , in europe there are about thirty atomic clocks between optical and fountain frequency standards .",
    "this network would establish a unique facility for testing fundamental physics , relativistic geodesy and for improving global navigation satellite systems @xcite .",
    "+ in addition , optical links could improve the synchronization in very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) antennas and particle accelerators @xcite .",
    "+ most of these applications require fiber hauls of thousands of kilometers , and this is a challenge for performances , installation costs , and link characterization . +",
    "this work presents the optical fiber link of implemented in italy , named lift ( italian link for time and frequency ) @xcite .",
    "lift connects the italian metrological institute ( inrim ) to several italian scientific poles which would largely benefit from improved frequency references . in particular , as shown in the map in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the fiber link provides a reference signal to the institute for photonics and nanotechnologies in milan , to the institute for radio - astronomy in medicina ( bologna ) and to the university of florence - european nonlinear spectroscopy laboratory ( unifi - lens ) in florence for precision measurements in atomic and molecular physics .",

    "to is turin , mi milan , bo bologna , fi florence ( elaboration based on googleearth ) . ]    to characterize the ultimate performance of the link in terms of residual phase noise and frequency uncertainty at the far fiber end , we need to compare the frequency of the delivered and of the original signal .",
    "we do it by looping the link so that the signal goes from inrim to unifi - lens and then comes back to inrim , after travelling in the optical fiber .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that it is not necessary to use two independent fibers for this characterization .",
    "this avoids the need of arming a separate twin link for the bare characterization purpose : the number of amplifiers is halved , and the reduction of the costs and of the infrastructure complexity benefits the effective implementation of continental long hauls .",
    "+ different approaches have been proposed in the literature to analyse the link instability and inaccuracy @xcite .",
    "we contribute to this discussion , also addressing some relevant issues in the use of the allan deviation estimator .",
    "in particular , its theoretical evaluation from the observed phase noise spectrum , and the need of reducing the measurement bandwidth , as an alternative to the use of the modified allan deviation @xcite .",
    "this is especially relevant with high phase noise or low control bandwidth , typical in long haul optical links . +",

    "these devices exhibit an amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) of at from the coherent carrier at , of at and of at .",
    "this large ase is filtered on a bandwidth of by 8 telecom optical filters to prevent the amplifiers gain saturation and the onset of auto - oscillations @xcite .",

    "the link is phase - stabilized through the doppler noise cancellation technique @xcite .",
    "the setup is shown in fig . [ fig2](a ) .",
    "the ultrastable laser l1 is the local oscillator , sent to unifi - lens ; few milliwatts of optical power are coupled into the fiber . in the remote laboratory a part of the signal is extracted and represents the delivered ultrastable signal , the remainder is reflected back to inrim by a faraday mirror , which compensates for the fiber birefringence .",
    "the acousto - optic fixed frequency shifter aom2 , at about , is used to distinguish the reflected signal from undesired backreflections along the fiber , that are not frequency - shifted . at inrim ,",

    "it is used to stabilize the link with a phase - locked loop ( pll ) acting on the acousto - optic modulator aom1 , operating at about .",
    "+ usually , the characterization of optical links is pursued by arming a second fiber in the same bundle with an independent set of amplifiers @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate a characterization technique that uses a single fiber and avoids the doubling of the amplifiers .",
    "the setup is shown in fig . [ fig2](b ) .",
    "the l1 radiation travels to unifi - lens and is reflected back to inrim , where it is extracted through the splitter s. a second independent ultrastable laser l2 works as a clean - up oscillator for the incoming signal and is phase - locked to it on a bandwidth of about by acting on the acousto - optic modulator aom3 , operating at .",
    "the clean - up radiation travels the doubled link in the backward direction , to provide a double - round - trip signal , needed for the link stabilization .",
    "the clean - up laser is required due to the relevant wideband noise added by the optical amplifiers and enables to achieve a signal to noise ratio of @xmath0 on a bandwidth of on the beatnote detected on pd1 , which is enough for the doubled link stabilization .",
    "the clean - up radiation is up - shifted in frequency by with respect to the incoming one ; the large frequency separation between the signal in each of the 4 passes allows a good rejection of the single rayleigh scattering , which has a bandwidth of few kilohertz , and avoids any crosstalk between the signals .",
    "the link performances are analysed by directly comparing l2 to l1 on the photodiode pd2 .",
    "the pd2 beatnote is tracked by a voltage - controlled oscillator and its phase noise spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , both in the free running ( black line ) and in the doppler compensated link configuration ( red line ) . because the doubled link delay is @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the refractive index of the fiber , @xmath3 the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath4 , the loop bandwidth is about .",
    "the noise of the compensated link achieves the fundamental limit ( blue line ) set by the round - trip delay @xcite and demonstrates that uncontrolled effects are not observed at this level .",
    "we calculated the round - trip delay limit following the approach described in @xcite , where it is demonstrated that @xmath5 , being @xmath6 the noise of the fiber haul .",

    "another detrimental effect is the loss of phase coherence ( cycles slips ) @xcite on the plls , that affects both the instability and the inaccuracy of the link .",
    "the cycles slips rate mainly depends on the signal to noise ratio of the beatnotes . in our setup , the cycles slips are a few per hour , provided a polarization adjustment every few hours .",
    "the phase of the beatnote on pd2 is measured with a dead - time - free digital phase recorder @xcite at the sampling rate of , equivalent to a bandwidth filter .",
    "the cycles slips are barely visible on the phase data even when low - pass filtered at bandwidth , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( red line ) ; however if we filter the data on a bandwidth of ( black line ) their detection is quite easy .",
    "+ particular care is devoted to the filtering process : instead of applying a simple average to the raw data , that acts like a first order low pass filter with cut - off frequency at half the reciprocal of the averaging time , we implemented a digital finite impulse response ( fir ) filter @xcite , with an out - of - bandwidth attenuation between .",
    "the sharper filtering allows a factor 2 of improvement in the stability for the same equivalent bandwidth , thanks to a higher attenuation of the large noise bump between and , that is typical in optical links .",
    "+    we realign the phase by subtracting an integer number of cycles , i.e. the minimum slip amplitude .",
    "finally , the phase data are further filtered on a bandwidth ( smooth blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , decimated according to the nyquist theorem , and differentiated to obtain the instantaneous frequency . + to evaluate the frequency instability , the allan deviation estimator is used @xcite . in the literature ,",
    "its expression is derived from the phase noise spectrum only in the cases where it is modelled by the relation @xcite : @xmath9 an analytical expression is not reported for a phase noise spectrum of the kind @xmath10 , such as the one observed in fig .",
    "this has already been reported in optical fiber links @xcite and depends on the peculiar transfer function of the system , affected by the fiber delay @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that in real systems , a low - pass filter with cut - off frequency @xmath11 is introduced to prevent noise divergence at high frequency .",
    "assuming that the filter is infinitely sharp , we calculate the analytical expression of the allan variance in presence of the observed type of noise , by performing the integration : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the averaging time and @xmath14 is the squared modulus of the allan variance transfer function @xcite .",
    "for @xmath15 the integration leads to : @xmath16 during the link operation , we measured an allan deviation of @xmath17 on a measurement bandwidth and of @xmath18 on a measurement bandwidth .",
    "this is in agreement with the prediction of eq .",

    "+ figure [ fig5 ] shows the allan deviation of the free running and compensated optical link on a measurement bandwidth , together with the stability of the compensated link on a bandwidth .",
    "a shorter data sample with less cycle slips was chosen to evaluate the stability at measurement bandwidth , since the cycle - slips could not be efficiently realigned with this bandwidth .",
    "the link achieves a short term instability of at in a bandwidth and an ultimate frequency resolution of in a bandwidth .",
    "+ we evaluate the accuracy of the link at because a non - repeatable frequency offset at this level exceeds the obtained frequency resolution . in spite of this ,",

    "data have been decimated according to the nyquist theorem . ]",
    "this work describes the realization and characterization of a coherent optical fiber link for frequency transfer over a haul .",
    "the characterization is pursued by doubling the link length to , so that both ends are in the same laboratory .",
    "the loop has been established using a single fiber ; the expected delay - unsuppressed noise is only slightly affected with respect to the value calculated for independent fibers @xcite .",
    "we avoided the arming of a second link ; this could be helpful , especially in view of long fiber hauls , as the number of optical amplifiers is considerably reduced .",
    "+ in the data analysis , we addressed the use of the allan deviation associated to narrow - bandwidth filtering , which allows a resolution equivalent to that obtained using other statistical estimators @xcite .",
    "+ on the doubled link , we obtain a short term allan deviation of at on the bandwidth of and an ultimate accuracy on the frequency transfer of at integration time .",
    "this is also an upper limit for the real dissemination over the link .",
    "+ the present infrastructure is now being used for the delivery of a high - accuracy frequency reference at lens , and will benefit the atomic physics experiments which are performed in this laboratory .",
    "the haul will soon be upgraded to perform the frequency dissemination to the institute of photonics and nanotechnologies in milan and to the medicina radio - telescopes , near bologna , for the vlbi antennas synchronization .",
    "extraction topologies such as those reported in @xcite are being considered as well as alternative techniques for the remote frequency comparisons @xcite , and raman optical amplification @xcite is being investigated as an alternative to the present architecture based on bedfa .",

    "this appendix demonstrates the formula for the delay - unsuppressed noise on a link with both ends in the same laboratory , and where the same fiber is used to loop the link , instead of two independent fibers .",
    "let us write the expression for the round - trip optical phase @xmath19 and for the forward signal optical phase @xmath20 , as a function of the fiber noise @xmath21 at time @xmath22 and position @xmath23 along the fiber and as a function of the phase correction needed for the link stabilization @xmath24 .",
