    "the study of accreting white dwarfs in close binaries is best accomplished using the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) portion of the spectrum for systems with low mass transfer rates . in these cases , the peak flux of the 1200050000k white dwarf @xcite dominates the accretion disk . if the spectral resolution is on the order of 1  or better and the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) at least of the order of 10 , then the temperature , rotation rate and chemical abundances of the white dwarf can be determined reliably from a single fuv spectrum .",
    "this has been demonstrated within our past observations and analyses using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) for ektra @xcite , egcnc , hvvir @xcite , lland , efpeg , @xcite , gwlib @xcite , vyaqr , wxcet @xcite , and alcom @xcite .",
    "the results of these past observations have shown that the coolest white dwarfs in disk - accreting systems cluster about 1200014000k , compared to single field white dwarfs , which have temperatures down to 5000k .",
    "thus , the white dwarfs in cvs are definitely heated by accretion @xcite .",
    "however , it is clear that we do not yet fully understand the relation between close binary evolution , accretion heating and white dwarf cooling .",
    "the measured white dwarf temperatures do not monotonically decrease with decreasing orbital period , which would be expected in a simple picture where cvs evolve from long to short orbital periods and from high to low mass transfer rates @xcite .",
    "at least one additional parameter that determines the white dwarf temperatures in cvs are the white dwarf masses    which are poorly known .",
    "furthermore , although several cvs are cool enough to lie in the instability strip for pulsating zzceti white dwarfs ( e.g. egcnc , @xcite ) , only one of our stis targets ( gwlib ) is known to pulsate    and paradoxically , its white dwarf is apparently too hot to be a pulsator @xcite . addressing the complex interplay between white dwarf properties and cv evolution clearly needs high - quality observational input for a sufficiently large sample of cv white dwarfs . in this paper",
    ", we present the analysis of the last three short - period dwarf novae from our cycle8 _ hst_/stis program displaying a white dwarf dominated far - ultraviolet spectrum : bwscl , bcuma and swuma .",
    "bwscl was initially found in the hamburg / eso quasar survey as he2350 - 3908 @xcite and independently discovered in the rosat survey as rxj2353.0 - 3852 @xcite .",
    "its extremely short orbital period ( 78.2min ) , double - humped optical light curve ( peak - to - peak variation 0.1mag ) , spectrum with double - peaked balmer emission flanked by broad absorption lines , and lack of visibility of any secondary star led augusteijn & wisotzki to conclude that this system was similar to wz , sge a prototype of short period , low accretion - rate cataclysmic variables with extreme amplitude outbursts that only occur on time scales of tens of years .",
    "they used the x - ray flux to obtain a quiescent accretion rate of only 10@xmath6m@xmath7 yr@xmath8 .",
    "to date , no outburst of bwscl has been observed .",
    "bcuma was first identified as a large amplitude dwarf nova @xcite .",
    "the first spectra by @xcite revealed evidence of the white dwarf from absorption surrounding the emission lines , as well as a secondary star later than m5 .",
    "they accomplished a crude fit to the blue spectrum and obtained a temperature of near 15000k and used the secondary to estimate a distance of 130400 pc .",
    "photometry by @xcite revealed @xmath9 and @xmath10 light curves with a single peak - to - peak variation of 0.25mag at a period of 91min when the system was at @xmath11 .",
    "later photometry during quiescence and superoutburst @xcite showed a double - humped light curve with smaller amplitude when the system was at @xmath12 .",
    "they also refined the period from spectroscopy to 90.2min .",
    "swuma is also a large amplitude , short period dwarf nova , but which is known to have several types of outbursts @xcite .",
    "the first time - resolved study @xcite revealed an orbital period of 81.8min from the spectra , while the photometry showed a repeatable 0.4mag hump on most nights .",
    "but on one night , when the mean magnitude was about 0.5mag fainter , the orbital variation disappeared and was replaced by a quasi - periodic oscillation with a period near 16 min .",
    "this change from hump presence to absence was also evident in the datasets of @xcite .",
    "another peculiarity of this system is the presence of a narrow h@xmath13 emission component which is most prominent at orbital phase 0.3 .",
    "doppler tomograms constructed from several of the emission lines showed a prominent disk contribution in the optical with enhanced emission at phases 0.3 , 0.6 and 0.9 @xcite .",
    "thus , swuma appears to have a higher mass transfer rate and more extensive disk than bwscl and bcuma . despite this",
    ", @xcite were able to see evidence of the white dwarf in the iue spectra , and determined a temperature for the white dwarf of 16000@xmath141500k .",
    "our stis spectra of these 3 systems are used to provide good constraints on the white dwarf temperature , disk contributions and variability of the uv compared to the optical light .",
    "additionally , the good s / n for the brighter systems bcuma and swuma allows us to obtain good values for the rotation rates and compositions of the white dwarfs .",
    "bwscl was observed in deep quiescence with _ hst _ during a single spacecraft orbit on 12 september 1999 ( table[t - obslog ] ) . from the stis ccd acquisition image",
    ", we derive a f28@xmath1550lp magnitude of 16.5 , roughly equivalent to an @xmath10 band measurement .",
    "the data were obtained using the e140 m echelle grating and the @xmath16 aperture .",
    "the nominal spectral resolution of this setup is @xmath17 , covering the range 1125@xmath181710 .",
    "bwscl was among the first targets observed in our cycle8 stis program , and we opted for the echelle grating in order to accurately measure the rotational velocity of the white dwarf from the doppler broadening of narrow metal lines .",
    "unfortunately , the fuv flux of bwscl was lower than expected , and the quality of the data is insufficient to exploit the high resolution of the e140 m grating .",
    "figure[f - stis_opt_spectra ] shows the stis data of bwscl rebinned to a resolution of @xmath19 .",
    "clearly visible is the broad flux turn over at @xmath20 which we identify as the  absorption line from the white dwarf photosphere .",
    "in addition , a large number of narrow metal absorption lines are detected , the most prominent ones being siii@xmath211260,65 , a complex of ci lines near 1280 , the blend of siii@xmath211304,05,09 and oi@xmath211304,06 , cii@xmath221335 , a feature at 1432  which is most likely due to caii ( possibly blended with some ci lines ) , siii@xmath211527,33 , a blend of ci lines at 155658 , and alii@xmath221670 .",
    "broad  and civ@xmath221550 emission are clearly present , the detection of narrow ciii@xmath221176 and heii@xmath221640 emission is less secure . the quality of the data decreases towards the blue and red ends of the spectrum because of the decreasing response of the instrument . at the red end ,",
    "the quality of the spectrum is deteriorated due to problems in extracting the individual echelle orders of this low - flux object , resulting in spurious emission / absorption edges .",
    "finally , three small gaps between the echelle orders are present at 1653 , 1671 , and 1690 .    in order to extend the wavelength coverage of bwscl for our analysis",
    "we have extracted the optical spectrum presented by @xcite , renormalizing it to the average magnitude of the system , @xmath23 ( fig.[f - stis_opt_spectra ] ) .",
    "the broad balmer absorption lines characteristic of a high - gravity white dwarf photosphere are clearly discerned .",
    "bcuma was observed with stis for five consecutive spacecraft orbits on 2000 july 18 ( table[t - obslog ] ) .",
    "the last outburst of bcuma previous to our stis observations initiated on 2000 march 31 , so the system had returned to its quiescent level long before the time of our hst pointing ( fig.[f - vso ] ) .",
    "analysis of the stis acquisition image provides a f28@xmath1550lp magnitude of @xmath24 .",
    "after our experience with the use of the e140 m grating for faint objects , we decided to use the g140l grating and the @xmath25 aperture , providing a nominal resolution of @xmath26  over the wavelength range 1150@xmath181715 .",
    "the stis spectra of bcuma obtained in the five individual _ hst _ orbits are nearly identical and have been co - added for the subsequent analysis ( fig.[f - stis_opt_spectra ] ) . as for bwscl , the average stis spectrum of bcuma also clearly reveals the photospheric spectrum of the accreting white dwarf : a very broad  profile superimposed by the same set of narrow low - ionization metal absorption lines .",
    "the only significant emission features are ciii@xmath221176 , a broad ( the narrow structures in  are residuals from the not perfectly removed geocoronal airglow ) and civ@xmath221550 .    a single optical spectrum ( red / blue pair ) of bcuma was obtained shortly before the _ hst _ pointing on 3 july 2000 using the apache point observatory 3.5 m telescope and double imaging spectrograph with a @xmath27 slit , giving @xmath28  resolution spectra in the regions from @xmath29  and @xmath30 .",
    "the data were reduced and calibrated in a standard fashion using iraf .",
    "the apo spectrum of bcuma ( fig.[f - stis_opt_spectra ] ) is very similar to that reported by @xcite , both in continuum flux and line strength .",
    "the weak  to  emission lines are flanked by broad absorption troughs , which are presumably of white dwarf photospheric origin .",
    "additional optical spectroscopy of bcuma was obtained at the mmt observatory on the night of 29 march 2001 using the red channel spectrograph ( table[t - obslog ] ) .",
    "a total of 11 600s blue ( 40005250 ) spectra and a single 600s red ( 56008500 ) spectrum were obtained .",
    "the setup used a 1 arcsec slit giving spectral resolutions of 1 / pixel in the blue and 0.5 / pixel in the red .",
    "the night appeared to be nearly photometric and of constant ( @xmath31 ) seeing as evidenced by watching the slit viewer camera during the course of the observations .",
    "the data were reduced in iraf using average bias and red / blue flat fields taken at the start of the night .",
    "the standard star feige 34 , used to flux the spectra , was observed near in time and airmass to the red spectrum and at the start of the blue time - series sequence .",
    "the absolute flux calibration appears good to near 10% as estimated by using one standard star to flux another .",
    "figure[f - stis_opt_spectra ] shows the average of the 11 blue spectra along with the single red spectrum .",
    "the emission lines are noticeably stronger and the overall flux level is higher in the mmt data , compared to the apo spectrum and to the spectrum in @xcite , suggesting that the mmt observations caught the system during a relatively active phase .",
    "the balmer lines are double - peaked , suggestive of an origin from the accretion disk in a moderately high - inclination system .",
    "as noticed by @xcite , the secondary star is discerned in the red part of the spectrum . however , the quality of our single red spectrum is not sufficient to improve the spectral typing of @xcite .",
    "swuma was observed with stis during two consecutive space craft orbits on 2000 may 26 ( table[t - obslog ] ) .",
    "the data were obtained using the same instrumental setup as described in sect.[s - obs_bcuma ] .",
    "the last outburst of swuma recorded before the stis pointing started on 2000 february 12 , lasted for @xmath1d , and the system was in quiescence for @xmath32d when the _ hst _ observations were carried out ( fig.[f - vso ] ) .",
    "swuma was found at very similar flux levels during both _",
    "orbits , and the average spectrum is shown in fig.[f - stis_opt_spectra ] .",
    "similar to bcuma , the white dwarf in swuma is revealed through its broad  absorption .",
    "however , in swuma the emission lines are much stronger compared to bcuma . in addition to emission of ciii , iv the stis spectrum of swuma also contains emission of siiii@xmath221206 , nv@xmath221240 , siiv@xmath221393,1402 , and heii@xmath221640 . the metallic absorption lines observed in bcuma are overall weaker in swuma , possibly filled in by emission . unambiguously detected in absorption are the ci complex at 1280 , the siii / oi blend at 1300 , caii@xmath221432 , siii@xmath211527,33 , and alii@xmath221670 .",
    "swuma was observed on 2000 may 28 at the apache point observatory .",
    "similar to the ultraviolet wavelength range , the optical emission lines in swuma are also significantly stronger compared to bcuma and bwscl , suggesting a stronger contribution of the accretion disk .",
    "correspondingly , the broad white dwarf photospheric absorption of  and  is less pronounced in swuma than in bcuma and bwscl .",
    "our approach in analyzing and modelling the stis data of bwscl , bcuma and swuma is very similar to the methods described in detail in our earlier papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ", we will only briefly summarise our general strategy .    at first",
    ", we derive the effective temperature  of the white dwarf , as well as a rough estimate of the chemical abundances in the atmosphere . for this purpose",
    ", we use a grid of white dwarf models calculated using tlusty195 and synspec45 @xcite , which covers @xmath33k in steps of 100k , @xmath34 in steps of 0.1 , and metal abundances of 0.1 , 0.5 , and 1.0 times their solar values .",
    "whereas fitting model spectra to the observations of a single white dwarf allows a determination of  as well as the surface gravity @xmath35 , the success of this approach is very limited in the case of cv white dwarfs for two reasons : ( 1 ) the stis fuv data , where the white dwarf is clearly the dominant emission component , do not provide sufficient wavelength coverage to break the degeneracy in  and @xmath36 .",
    "more specifically , only the red wing of  is covered by the stis observations ; ( 2 ) in contrast to single white dwarfs where fitting the balmer lines strongly constrains /@xmath35 , the optical spectrum of cvs is severely contaminated by emission from the quiescent accretion disk . in the view of these limitations , we only use  and the metal abundances as free parameters in the fit , keeping @xmath35 fixed . in order to account for the observed emission lines we fit the lines with gaussian profiles , and we exclude the central 20  of  from the fit to avoid contamination by residual geocoronal  emission .",
    "the correlation between the assumed @xmath35 ( = white dwarf mass ) and the best - fit value for  is then determined by repeating the fit while stepping through the grid in @xmath35 .",
    "a nearly linear correlation between  and @xmath35 is found ( fig.[f - diagnostic ] ) . using a mass - radius relation for carbon - core white dwarfs @xcite",
    "we obtain @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the flux scaling factor between the white dwarf model and the stis spectrum is then used to calculate the distance of the system , and the @xmath39 magnitude of the white dwarf is computed .",
    ", , @xmath40 and @xmath39 are illustrated as a function of @xmath35 in the diagnostic diagrams shown in fig.[f - diagnostic ] .",
    "once that  is established , we refine the models in terms of the chemical abundances and white dwarf rotation rates . for each object ,",
    "a grid of model spectra is generated ( adopting the best - fit temperature for @xmath41 ) that covers metal abundances from 0.1 to 1.0 times their solar values , in steps of 0.1 , and rotation rates ( @xmath42 ) ranging from 200  to 1000 , in steps of 100 .",
    "several small wavelength ranges including metal lines of c , o , si , and al are then fitted , normalizing the model spectra to the local continuum ( fig.[f - vsini ] ) .",
    "additional details describing the analysis of the individual objects are given below .",
    "the stis spectrum of bwscl is well described by a ( @xmath43k , @xmath41 ) model spectrum with 0.5 times solar metal abundances ( fig.[f - stis_fit ] , top - left panel ) .",
    "we find @xmath44 , which implies statistically a very good fit .",
    "however , in view of the large errors of the echelle data ( fig.[f - stis_fit ] ) , a better statement is that our model is a good approximation considering the large uncertainties in the data .",
    "extending the white dwarf model spectrum into the optical range does not provide much of a constraint on the white dwarf mass , as all models fall below the observed spectrum , as well as below the f28@xmath1550lp magnitude derived from the stis acquisition image .",
    "assuming a white dwarf mass in the range @xmath45implies @xmath46k , and a distance of @xmath47pc .",
    "fixing @xmath43k and @xmath41 , we determine @xmath48 times solar abundances for carbon , oxygen and silicon , whereas aluminium is found to be significantly overabundant ( by a factor three ) with respect to its solar value ( fig.[f - vsini ] ) .",
    "we have investigated whether the effect of interstellar absorption could mimic the derived al overabundance .",
    "inspection of fuv interstellar absorption lines at both low and high galactic latitudes shows that the strength of alii@xmath221670 is comparable to that of siii@xmath221260 , 1302 , 1527 , oi@xmath221302 , and cii@xmath221335 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as we do not detect excess absorption in any of these other lines , we conclude that the observed enhancement of the aluminium line is intrinsic to bwscl , and suggests a substantial overabundance of al in the photosphere of the white dwarf .",
    "the only caveat to this statement is that alii@xmath221670 is by far the strongest ( factor @xmath0 ) al line in the entire ultraviolet wavelength range . confirming the al abundance derived here would need high - resolution fuv ( e.g. e140 m ) data at high s / n to make use of @xmath0 weaker alii , iii lines for spectral modelling .",
    "the narrow widths of the observed metal absorption lines implies a low rotation rate , @xmath49 .      applying a simple white dwarf model fit to the stis observations of bcuma results in @xmath50k for @xmath41 ,",
    "however , this fit does not adequately reproduce the wavelength range @xmath51 , where the observed flux level significantly exceeds that of the model spectrum . in order to account for this additional component",
    ", we have repeated the fits to the stis data of bcuma , allowing for either a power - law or a blackbody contribution to the fuv spectrum .",
    "the best - fit parameter for the second component is either a power - law index of @xmath52 or a blackbody temperature of 14000k . in both cases",
    ", the additional continuum component contributes @xmath53 of the flux at 1400 .",
    "the white dwarf effective temperature remains nearly unchanged , @xmath54k , but the somewhat smaller scaling factor results in a slightly larger distance estimate .",
    "assuming again a white dwarf mass in the range @xmath45  we find @xmath55k , and a distance of @xmath56pc .    adding the second continuum component improves the fit in terms of @xmath57 , which drops from @xmath58 for the white - dwarf - only fit to @xmath59 for the two - component models . on statistical grounds ,",
    "both fits are poor , which is a sign that either the flux errors provided by the stis pipeline are underestimated ; there are additional systematic errors not accounted for by the pipeline ; or that our model is not fully appropriate to describe the data .",
    "the reality is likely to be a mix of the second and third possibility .",
    "we have inspected high s / n stis g140l spectra of the @xmath60k single da white dwarf grw+70@xmath615824 which reveal various wiggles that are not real and result in @xmath62 when fit with a model spectrum .",
    "in addition , our simple approach for approximating the disk emission by a component made up from a smooth slope plus gaussian emission lines is certainly a fairly poor model for the reality . keeping these limitations in mind , we adopted the following strategy to assess the statistical relevance of the second continuum component .",
    "we have renormalized the errors of the observed stis spectrum so that @xmath63 for the two - component model .",
    "the wavelength independent factor used for this procedure was 1.45 , which , assuming we had a perfect model for the data and no additional systematic errors , would imply that the flux errors provided by the pipeline are underestimated by this factor .",
    "next , we calculated @xmath64 for the single white dwarf fit using the renormalized errors , which implies that the single white dwarf fit is an inacceptable description of the data . on statistical grounds",
    "there is , however , no preference for either the white dwarf plus blackbody or white dwarf plus power law model : both two - component fits provide basically a nearly flat continuum component underlying the white dwarf emission , and improve the fit by similar amounts with respect to a single white dwarf model .",
    "the physical interpretation of the additional continuum component is emission either associated with the quiescent accretion disk or the hot spot . in the case of optically thin emission from an optically thin disk ( or a thin hot layer on top of a colder optically thick disk ) , a power - law description would account for the wavelength dependence of the free - free absorption coefficient .",
    "our blackbody approach would be a simple description for optically thick emission from the hot spot . at a distance of @xmath65pc , the radius of the blackbody component , assuming a spherical shape , would be @xmath66 cm .",
    "the temperature implied by the fit appears somewhat high with respect to the existing temperature estimates for hot spots ( e.g. @xcite ) , which are mostly based on blackbody analyses of either the orbital flux variation in the ultraviolet and/or optical or of the eclipse ingress / egress profiles .",
    "it is not too surprising that fitting a blackbody to the fuv continuum results in a different temperature estimate , moreover a blackbody is only a very simple approach . extending the second component into the optical ,",
    "it is clear that a simple power - law is an unphysical concept , as the free - free absorption coefficient breaks down at the balmer edge . in fig.[f - stis_fit ] we have plotted the uv - optical spectral energy distribution of bcuma , along with the best - fit white dwarf plus blackbody model . taking the flux level of the apo spectra at face value , they would constrain @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath68 . however , the f28@xmath1550lp flux at the time of the _ hst _ observations exceeds that of the apo spectra , and we remain without a stringent constraint on the white dwarf mass .",
    "real progress on the sed modelling of quiescent dwarf novae will need a realistic physical model for the emission of the accretion disk .",
    "for the detailed metal line fitting , we fixed @xmath54k and @xmath41 , and find carbon , oxygen and silicon , abundances at @xmath69 times their solar values .",
    "as for bwscl , the fit to alii@xmath221670 requires the abundance of aluminium to be significantly ( by a factor two ) super - solar .",
    "in contrast to the e140 m echelle data of bwscl , the g140l of bcuma is not affected by instrumental features in the region around alii@xmath221670 , lending further support for the detection of an enhanced aluminium abundance . the observed line profiles are best fit with a rotation rate of @xmath70 .      in the case of swuma ,",
    "the additional contribution in excess of the white dwarf photosphere is even more evident than in bcuma .",
    "the emission lines of ciii@xmath221176 , civ@xmath211550 and heii@xmath221640 are much stronger , the emission lines of siiii@xmath221206 , nv@xmath221240 , cii@xmath221335 , siiv@xmath211393,1402 are also clearly present , and the continuum flux underlying the white dwarf spectrum is substantially stronger .    fitting the stis spectrum with a white dwarf alone ( plus gaussian profiles for all the detected emission lines ) results in @xmath71k for @xmath41 , but with a very high @xmath57 of @xmath72 .",
    "consequently , we applied the two - component model described in sect.[s - bcuma ] to the stis spectrum of swuma and find @xmath73k for the white dwarf ( again for @xmath41 ) plus a blackbody of @xmath74k or a power law with a spectral index @xmath52 ( fig.[f - stis_fit ] ) .",
    "the non - white dwarf contribution to the continuum flux is @xmath75% at 1400 .",
    "for a white dwarf mass in the range @xmath45 , our fit to the stis data implies @xmath76k and @xmath77pc .",
    "adopting this two - component approach makes a substantial difference in @xmath78 , which drops to @xmath79 for both cases , white dwarf plus either a blackbody or a power law .",
    "the temperature of the blackbody component seems too high for a hot spot , but as mentioned above , a blackbody is probably an oversimplified model for the hot spot    if the hot spot is indeed the source of the observed additional continuum flux . for completeness the radius of the blackbody component , assuming spherical geometry and a distance of @xmath80pc , is @xmath81 cm    very similar to that found in the case of bcuma . for swuma",
    ", the optical spectra do not provide an additional constraint on @xmath35 , as all white models fall below the optical flux .",
    "fixing @xmath73k and @xmath41 , we refined the analysis of the metal absorption lines , and find the abundances of carbon , oxygen and silicon to be at @xmath69 times their solar values .",
    "similar to bwscl and bcuma , the abundance of aluminium is supra - solar by a factor 1.7 .",
    "some care has to be applied to these abundance measurements , as the presence of various strong emission lines could imply that the absorption lines observed in the stis spectrum are filled in to some extent by emission .",
    "this should , however , not affect the large abundance ratio of aluminium to the other elements .",
    "it appears that the metal lines are not resolved at the resolution of the g140l grating , implying @xmath49 .",
    "all stis data were obtained in the time - tag mode , recording the arrival time and detector coordinate for each individual photon .",
    "this enables us to extract light curves over any selected wavelength range and at an arbitrary time resolution .    in the case of bwscl , however , the use of the e140 m echelle grating , which distributes the source photons over 44 individual echelle orders on the mama detector , prevents a reliable background subtraction .",
    "extracting all photons and binning them into a 30sec light curve shows a low - amplitude modulation on a time scale of @xmath82min .",
    "alas , with the unknown contribution of the background , it is not possible to unequivocally ascribe this modulation to the source , or to the variation of the background throughout the orbit of _",
    "hst_. however , the stis time - tag data do not show any evidence for short - period flickering .",
    "bcuma was observed with the g140l first - order grating , and background - subtracted light curves were extracted for both the continuum and the civ line ( see @xcite for a description of the methods used ) . within the errors , the count rates are consistent with constant emission .",
    "swuma was also been observed with the g140l grating , and we extracted continuum and civ light curves ( fig.[f - ttag ] ) .",
    "variability is seen on time scales ranging from @xmath83sec to @xmath84sec . a period ( lomb - scargle ) analysis of the data does not reveal any periodicities , specifically no signal is found either at the hypothetical 15.9min white dwarf spin period @xcite , or at the orbital period .",
    "the variance of the continuum and civ light curves are 6% and 25% , respectively , clearly indicating that the flickering is primarily associated with the emission lines    in agreement with our results on ektra @xcite .",
    "as part of our medium - size cycle8 _ hst_/stis program , we have observed 16 cataclysmic variables , with the aim of significantly improving our knowledge about the properties of accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables @xcite . for twelve systems , our strategy / selection worked well , and the analysis of the stis spectra of their white dwarfs roughly doubled the number of effective temperature measurements for non - magnetic cv white dwarfs , and quadrupled the number of abundance / rotation rate estimates .    the white dwarf temperatures found range from @xmath85k ( egcnc , @xcite ) to @xmath86k ( ektra , @xcite ) , with a strong clustering near @xmath87k    where the three systems presented here also fall . in a simple - minded picture of cv evolution , one might expect the lowest white dwarf temperatures near the minimum period , where the accretion rates should be lowest . in our sample , this is not the case : bwscl is the shortest - period ( @xmath88min ) dwarf nova with @xmath89k , whereas the coldest white dwarf ( @xmath90k ) is found in egcnc at @xmath91min .",
    "however , one significantly colder white dwarf has recently been found near the minimum period , hs2331 + 3905 ( @xmath92min , @xmath93k ; @xcite ) , and some of the cv white dwarfs discovered by sloan @xcite may turn out to be very cold as well .",
    "the observed spread in @xmath94 might to some extent be related to different white dwarf masses , as the accretion luminosity is , at constant accretion rate , proportional to @xmath95 .",
    "none of the 12 white dwarfs observed within our program is a rapid rotator  ",
    "in fact , for most systems we could only determine upper limits on the rotation rate .",
    "this strongly suggests that the angular momentum coupling between the white dwarf envelope and its core is rather inefficient , and that the bulk of the accreted angular momentum is lost in the shell ejected during nova eruptions .",
    "we have found substantial sub - solar abundances in all 12 white dwarfs analyzed in this program .",
    "it appears unlikely that these low white dwarf photospheric abundances reflect significant sub - solar metallicities of their donor stars , as the majority of cvs should be ordinary galactic disk objects .",
    "it is more likely that the abundances observed in the white dwarf photospheres reflect an accretion / diffusion equilibrium ( radiative levitation is irrelevant for the low temperatures of most cv white dwarfs ) .",
    "while it would be of fundamental importance to estimate accretion rates from such equilibrium abundances , a quantitative exploitation of this method is currently not possible as all published diffusion calculations have been carried out either for single da or single db white dwarfs , and we underline the need for detailed studies of diffusion time scales for various ions in cv white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "an additional uncertainty in the interpretation of the sub - solar abundances in cv white dwarfs is the uncertain distribution of the accreted material over the white dwarf surface , i.e. whether a lateral abundance gradient from the equator , where the material is accreted from the accretion disk , to the poles exist .",
    "while the current data can not be used to assess this possibility , future spectroscopy with high resolution and high s / n might shed light on this question , as the detailed shape of doppler - broadened line profiles will depend on such a lateral abundance gradient .",
    "unfortunately , the low s / n prevented detailed abundance measurements of individual chemical species for most systems .",
    "the high s / n data presented here suggest an overabundance of aluminium in bwscl , bcuma , and swuma . at present",
    ", we are not yet able to interpret the abundances anomalies of some elements that have been observed in a number of cv white dwarfs in an unambiguous way .",
    "the peculiar abundances of odd - numbered nuclei may be related to proton - capture during classical nova eruptions , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "alternatively , abundance anomalies seen in the white dwarf atmosphere may just reflect abundance anomalies of the companion star as a result of its evolution in a binary system @xcite .",
    "our cycle8 program has quadrupled the number of reliable effective temperature measurements for short - period dwarf novae , and demonstrated the potential for abundance and rotation velocity measurements .",
    "further progress in our understanding of both the properties of white dwarfs in cvs as well as cv evolution needs a larger sample of well - observed systems _ and _ a reliable estimate of their white dwarf masses    however , this progress crucially depends on the availability of fuv instruments with a higher throughput and higher spectral resolution , such as the cosmic origin spectrograph could provide .",
