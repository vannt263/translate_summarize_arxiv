    "[ fig : m_0sol_norm_posi2 ] we repeat the same exercise but for @xmath83 . the most significant effect of a non zero @xmath140 is the increase of the size of the no lower bound band , which can in some cases stretch over the entire lma allowed region , otherwise the behavior of the upper and lower bound lines is qualitatively similar to the previous case .",

    "we can see that qualitative behavior of the iso - contours for the upper bound is similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_0sol_norm_posi0 ] but it is different for the trend of the lower bound curves . compared to the case where positive @xmath141 signal is obtained , it is more difficult to put lower bound on @xmath1",
    ". this can be easily understood from fig .",
    "[ fig : m_ee - m0 ] ( a ) .",
    "we note that unless we can constrain @xmath2 down to @xmath142 mev , no lower bound on @xmath1 is obtained . in fig .",

    "[ fig : m_0sol_norm_nega0 ] but for @xmath83 .",

    "[ fig : m_0sol_norm_nega0 ] is that the constraint on @xmath1 become somewhat weaker , leading to larger upper bounds and smaller lower bounds for a given set of @xmath136 .",
    "finally , let us also comment the case of inverted ordering .",
    "for this case , we can easily estimate the upper as well as lower bound from the analytic expressions as well as from the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : m_ee - m0 ] .",
    "let us look at fig .",
    "[ fig : m_ee - m0 ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "first of all , if the inverted ordering is the case , the observed value of @xmath2 in @xmath0 decay experiment must be larger than the value given in eq .",

    "[ sec : m_0_dependence ] . if the observed @xmath2 is smaller than @xmath143 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : smallm0_meemax_inverted ] ) ) then there is no lower bound on @xmath1 whereas the upper bound is given by the same expression for the case of normal ordering , by eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_0_max ] ) .",
    "if the observed @xmath2 value is larger than @xmath143 , then the upper as well as lower bounds are given by the same expression as in the case of normal ordering , which is already discussed in this section .",
    "we have studied how the _ non - oscillation _ neutrino parameters which can not be extracted from the oscillation analysis , the absolute neutrino mass scale and two cp violating majorana phases , can be accessed by the positive or negative signal of future @xmath123 decay experiments .",
    "we have carried out this by choosing various different set of mixing parameters which are varied within the parameter region currently allowed by the solar , atmospheric as well as by reactor neutrino experiments .    in the future",
    ", the katrin experiment expects to directly inspect @xmath1 down to @xmath3 340 mev  @xcite , while there are several proposed astrophysical measurements on the temperature perturbation in the early universe imprinted in the cosmic microwave background radiation , such as the ones that can be performed by map ( microwave anisotropy probe )  @xcite and planck  @xcite , which can probe @xmath1 down to @xmath3 300 mev  @xcite , where the expected sensitivity suffers from the uncertainty coming from cosmological parameters .",
    "it is expected that future supernova neutrino measurements can probe @xmath1 down to at most @xmath3 ( 2 - 3 ) ev  @xcite .",
    "our analysis permit us to conclude that if these experiments measure @xmath4 mev , then either a positive signal of @xmath0 decay compatible with @xmath5 mev must be observed in the near future or neutrinos are dirac particles .",

    "( [ rsol ] ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "if these experiments do not observe any positive signal of @xmath4 mev , results from future @xmath0 decay experiments combined with more precise values of the neutrino oscillation parameters , specially the solar ones ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) , which can be precisely determined by the kamland experiment  @xcite , will place more stringent bounds on @xmath1 for the majorana case provided that the sensitivity of @xmath146 30 mev is achieved . to be more specific , if a positive signal is observed around @xmath9 mev ( assuming a 30% uncertainty on the determination of @xmath2 ) , we estimate @xmath8 at 95 % c.l . ; on the other hand , if no signal is observed down to @xmath9 mev , then @xmath10 mev at 95 % c.l .",
    "allowing for a more optimistic sensitivity , a positive signal observed around @xmath147 mev or no signal seen down to 3 mev would mean @xmath148 mev at 95 % c.l .",
    "these bounds can be improved by a better determination of @xmath106 , @xmath105 and @xmath140 as can be clearly seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : m_0sol_norm_posi0]-  [ fig : m_0sol_norm_nega2 ] , as well as by the reduction of the uncertainties in the theoretical calculations of the nuclear matrix elements .",
    "we finally conclude that it is possible to constrain the cp violating phase @xmath22 to values around @xmath65 if : ( 1 ) @xmath1 is large enough to be detected by katrin or by astrophysical observations and future @xmath123 decay experiments observe @xmath2 close to its minimum value or ( 2 ) future @xmath123 decay experiments can achieve a sensitivity on @xmath149 mev , depending on the values of the solar parameters and on the uncertainty on @xmath2 ( fig .

    "unfortunately , nothing can be known about @xmath23 .    despite of",
    "the fact that the parameter region inspected in this work differs from the one considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have found , in agreement with this reference , that evidence for cp violation can not be observed by future @xmath94 decay experiments , since the possible values of @xmath22 , whenever it can be constrained to some non - zero value , always include @xmath65 , unless @xmath1 can be independently determined by some other experiment .",
