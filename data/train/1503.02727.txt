    "compressive sensing ( cs ) enables one to sample signals that admit a sparse representation in some transform basis well - below the nyquist rate , while still enabling their faithful recovery @xcite .",
    "since many natural and man - made signals exhibit a sparse representations , cs has the potential to reduce the costs associated with sampling in numerous practical applications .      the single pixel camera ( spc ) @xcite and its multi - pixel extensions @xcite are spatial - multiplexing camera ( smc ) architectures that rely on cs . in this paper , we focus on such smc designs , which acquire random ( or coded ) projections of a ( typically static ) scene using a spatial light modulator ( slm ) in combination with a small number of optical sensors , such as single photodetectors or bolometers .",
    "the use of a small number of optical sensors  in contrast to full - frame sensors having millions of pixel elements  turns out to be advantageous when acquiring scenes at non - visible wavelengths .",
    "since the acquisition of scene information beyond the visual spectrum often requires sensors built from exotic materials , corresponding full - frame sensor devices are either too expensive or cumbersome @xcite .",
    "obviously , the use of a small number of sensors is , in general , not sufficient for acquiring complex scenes at high resolution .",
    "hence , existing smcs assume that the scenes to be acquired are static and acquire multiple measurements over time . for static scenes ( i.e. , images ) and for a single - pixel smc architecture , this sensing strategy has been shown to deliver good results @xcite typically at a compression of 2 - 8@xmath1 .",
    "this approach , however , fails for time - variant scenes ( i.e. , videos ) .",
    "the main reason is due to the fact that the time - varying scene to be captured is ephemeral , i.e. , _ each _ measurement acquires information of a ( slightly ) _ different _ scene .",
    "the situation is further aggravated when we deal with smcs having a very small number of sensors ( e.g. , only one for the spc ) .",
    "virtually all existing methods for cs - based video recovery ( e.g. , @xcite ) seem to overlook the important fact that scenes are changing while one acquires compressive measurements .",
    "in fact , all of the mentioned smc video systems treat scenes as a sequence of _ static _ frames ( i.e. , as piece - wise constant scenes ) as opposed to a continuously changing scene .",
    "this disconnect between the real - world operation of smcs and the assumptions commonly made for video cs motivates novel smc acquisition systems and recovery algorithms that are able to deal with the ephemeral nature of real scenes .",
    "figure  [ fig : static ] illustrates the effect of assuming piece - wise static scenes . put simply , grouping too few measurements for reconstruction results in poor spatial resolution ; grouping too many measurements results in severe temporal aliasing artifacts .      high - quality video cs recovery methods for camera designs relying on temporal multiplexing ( in contrast to spatial multiplexing as it is the case for smcs ) are generally inspired by video compression schemes and exploit motion estimation between individually recovered frames @xcite .",
    "applying such techniques for smc architectures , however , results in a fundamental problem : on the one hand , obtaining motion estimates ( e.g. , the optical flow between pairs of frames ) requires knowledge of the individual video frames . on the other hand ,",
    "recovering the video frames in absence of motion estimates is difficult , especially when using low sampling rates and a small number of sensor elements ( cf .",
    "[ fig : static ] ) .",
    "attempts to address this `` chicken - and - egg '' problem either perform multi - scale sensing @xcite or sense separate patches of the individual video frames @xcite",
    ". however , both approaches ignore the time - varying nature of real - world scenes and rely on a piecewise static scene model .     pixels .",
    "the scene , similar to figure [ fig : static ] , consists of a pendulum with the letter ` r ' swinging from right to left .",
    "a total of 16,384 measurements were acquired and videos were reconstructed under the three different signal models . also shown are @xmath2 and @xmath3 slices corresponding to the lines marked . in all , cs - muvi delivers high spatial as well as temporal resolution unachievable by both naive frame - to - frame wavelet sparsity as well as the more sophisticated 3d total variations model .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , cs - muvi is the first demonstration of successful video recovery at 128@xmath1 super - resolution on _ real data _ obtained from an spc . ]      in this paper , we propose a novel sensing and recovery method for videos acquired by smc architectures , such as the spc  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : overview ] ) with an overview of our sensing and recovery framework . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tradeoff ] , we study the recovery performance of time - varying scenes and demonstrate that the performance degradation caused by violating the static - scene assumption is severe , even at moderate levels of motion .",
    "we then detail a novel video cs strategy for smc architectures that overcomes the static - scene assumption .",
    "our approach builds upon a co - design of scene acquisition and video recovery .",
    "in particular , we propose a novel class of cs matrices that enables us to obtain a low - resolution `` preview '' of the scene at low computational complexity .",
    "this preview video is used to extract robust motion estimates ( i.e. , the optical flow ) of the scene at full - resolution ( in sec .",
    "[ sec : designmeas ] ) .",
    "we exploit these motion estimates to recover the full - resolution video by using off - the - shelf convex - optimization algorithms typically used for cs ( in sec .",

    "this paper contains an improved recovery algorithm , a more detailed performance analysis , and a larger number of experimental results .",

    "a classical problem is the design of matrix @xmath10 , which results in minimal recovery error .",
    "as shown in @xcite , hadamard matrices are optimal in guaranteeing the smallest possible error when the measurement noise @xmath15 is signal independent .",
    "specifically , if an @xmath16 hadamard matrix were to exist , then the recovery error satisfies @xmath17 , which is a dramatic reduction from @xmath18 achieved by @xmath13 .",
    "while hadamard multiplexing provides immense benefits in the context of imaging , it still requires an invertible measurement matrix , i.e , the dimensionality of the measurement @xmath19 needs to be the same ( or greater ) than that of the sensed signal @xmath20 . for smcs that aggregate measurements over a time period",
    ", this implies a long acquisition period as the dimensionality of the signal @xmath21 increases .",
    "this also leads to a poorer temporal resolution .",
    "all of these concerns can potentially be addressed if it were possible to reconstruct a signal from far - fewer measurements than its dimensionality or when @xmath22 .",
    "such a sensing framework is popularly referred to as _ compressive sensing .",
    "_ we discuss this approach next .",

    "a fundamental result from cs theory states that a robust estimate of the vector @xmath20 can be obtained from @xmath29 measurements if    the signal @xmath20 admits a @xmath27-sparse representation in an orthonormal basis @xmath30 ( i.e. , @xmath31 has no more than @xmath27 non - zero entries ) , and    the _ effective _ sensing matrix @xmath32 satisfies the restricted isometry property ( rip ) @xcite .",
    "for example , if the entries of the sensing matrix @xmath33 are i.i.d .",
    "zero - mean gaussian distributed , then @xmath32 is known to satisfy the rip with high probability .",
    "furthermore , any @xmath27-sparse signal @xmath20 satisfying can be estimated stably from the noisy measurement @xmath19 by solving the following convex - optimization problem @xcite : @xmath34 here , @xmath35 denotes matrix transposition and the parameter @xmath36 is a bound on the measurement noise . for @xmath27-sparse signals",
    ", it can be shown that recovery error is bounded from above by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a constant .",
    "hence , in the noiseless setting ( where @xmath39 ) , the @xmath27-sparse signal @xmath20 can be recovered perfectly , even by acquiring far - fewer measurements than the signal s dimensionality .",

    "the operator @xmath41 can be defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the spatial gradients in x- and y - direction of the 2-dimensional image @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "this definition can easily be extended to extended to higher - dimensional signals , such as rgb color images or videos ( where the 3@xmath46 dimension is time ) .",
    "we next look at the prior art devoted specifically to cs of videos .      an important challenge in cs of videos is that the temporal dimension is fundamentally different from spatial and spectral dimensions due to its ephemeral nature .",
    "the causality of time prevents us from obtaining additional measurements of an event that has already occurred .",
    "this is especially relevant for smcs that aggregate measurements over a time period .",
    "further , temporal statistics of a video are often different from the spatial statistics .",
    "these unique characteristics have lead to a large body of work dedicated to video cs , and can broadly be grouped into signal models and corresponding recovery algorithms , and novel compressive imaging architectures .",
    "smcs are imaging architectures that build on the ideas of cs . in particular",
    ", they employ an slm , e.g. , a digital micro - mirror device ( dmd ) or liquid crystal on silicon ( lcos ) , to optically compute a series linear projections of the scene  @xmath42 ; these linear projections determine the rows of the sensing matrix @xmath33 .",
    "since smcs are usually built with only a few sensor elements , they can operate at wavelengths where corresponding full - frame sensors are too expensive . in the recovery stage , one estimates the image @xmath42 from the compressive measurements collected in  @xmath19 , for example , by solving ( p1 ) or variants thereof .",

    "@xcite use 3-dimensional wavelets as a sparsifying basis for videos and recover all frames of the video jointly under this prior . unlike images , videos are not well represented using wavelets since they have additional temporal properties , like brightness constancy , that are better represented using motion - flow models .",
    "park and wakin @xcite analyzed the coupling between spatial and temporal bandwidths of a video .",
    "in particular , they argue that reducing the spatial resolution of a scene implicitly reduces its temporal bandwidth and hence , lowers the error caused by the static scene assumption .",
    "this builds the foundation for the multi - scale sensing and recovery approach proposed in @xcite , where several compressive measurements are acquired at multiple scales for each video frame . the recovered video at coarse scales ( low spatial resolution )",
    "is used to estimate motion , which is then used to boost the recovery at finer scales ( high spatial resolution ) . other scene models and recovery algorithms for video cs with the spc use block - based models @xcite , sparse frame - to - frame residuals @xcite , linear dynamical systems @xcite , and low rank plus sparse models @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "all of them report results only on synthetic data and use the assumption that each frame of the video remains static for a certain duration of time ( typically @xmath54 of a second)an assumption that is violated when operating with an actual spc .",
    "in contrast to smcs that use sensors having low - spatial resolution and seek to spatially super - resolve images and videos , temporal multiplexing cameras ( tmcs ) have low frame - rate sensors and seek to temporally super - resolve videos .",

    "we now show the construction of a such a dss matrix  @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : meas_design](a ) ) .",
    "a simple way is to start with a @xmath107 hadamard matrix @xmath106 and to write the cs matrix as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a down - sampling matrix satisfying @xmath111 , and @xmath112 is an auxiliary matrix that obeys the following constraints :    the entries of @xmath33 are @xmath113 ,    the matrix  @xmath33 has good cs recovery properties ( e.g. , satisfies the rip ) , and    @xmath114 should be chosen such that @xmath115 .",
    "note that an easy way to ensure that @xmath33 be @xmath104 is to interpret @xmath114 as sign flips of the hadamard matrix @xmath106 .",

    "choosing random entries in  @xmath114 such that @xmath115 ( i.e. , by using random patterns of high spatial frequency ) provides excellent performance .",

    "the use of hadamard matrices for the low - resolution part in the proposed dss matrices has an additional benefit .",
    "hadamard matrices have fast inverse transforms , which can significantly speed up the recovery of the low - resolution preview frames .",
    "such a `` fast '' dss matrix has the key capability of generating a high - quality _ preview _ of the scene ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : preview ] ) with very low computational complexity ; this is beneficial for video cs as it allows one to easily and quickly extract an estimate of the scene motion .",
    "the motion estimate can then be used to recover the video at its full resolution ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : optical ] ) .",
    "in addition to this , the use of fast dss matrices can be beneficial in various other ways , including ( but not limited to ) :    [ [ digital - viewfinder ] ] digital viewfinder + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    conventional smc architectures do not enable the observation of the scene until cs recovery is performed . due to the high computational complexity of most existing cs recovery algorithms , there is typically a large latency between the acquisition of a scene and its observation .",
    "fast dss matrices offer an _ instantaneous _ visualization of the scene ,",
    "i.e. , they can provide a real - time digital viewfinder ; this capability substantially simplifies the setup of an smc in practice .",
    "[ [ adaptive - sensing ] ] adaptive sensing + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the immediate knowledge of the scene  even at a low resolution  is a key enabler for adaptive sensing strategies .",
    "for example , one may seek to extract the changes that occur in a scene from one frame to the next or track the locations of moving objects , while avoiding the typically high latency caused by computationally complex cs recovery algorithms .",
    "crucial to the design of the dss matrix is the selection of the parameter @xmath55 . while @xmath55 is often scene - specific , a good rule of thumb is as follows : given an @xmath64 scene , choose @xmath122 such that the motion of objects is less than @xmath123 pixels in the amount of time required to get @xmath55 measurements .",
    "basically , this would serve to have motion in the preview images restricted to 1 pixel ( at the resolution of the preview image ) .",
    "we next detail the second part of cs - muvi , where we obtain the video at a high spatial resolution by estimating and enforcing motion estimates between frames .",
    "thanks to the preview mode , we can estimate the optical flow between any two ( low - resolution ) frames @xmath124 and  @xmath125 . for cs - muvi , we compute optical - flow estimates at full spatial resolution between pairs of upsampled preview frames . for the results in the paper , we used `` bicubic '' interpolation to upsample the frames .",
    "this approach turns out to result in more accurate optical - flow estimates compared to an approach that first estimates the optical flow at low resolution followed by upsampling of the optical flow .",

    ", we enforce consistency between the forward and backward optical flows ; specifically , we discard optical flow constraints at pixels where the sum of the forward and backward flow causes a displacement greater than one pixel .      before we detail the individual steps of the cs - muvi video - recovery procedure , it is important to specify the rate of the frames to be recovered . when sensing scenes with smc architectures , there is no obvious notion of frame rate .",
    "one notion of the frame rate comes from the measurement rate which in the case of the spc is the operating rate of the dmd .",
    "however , this rate is extremely high and leads to videos whose dimensions are too high to allow feasible computations .",
    "further , each frame would be associated with a _",
    "single _ measurement which leads to a severely ill - conditioned inverse problem .",
    "a potential definition comes from the work of park and wakin @xcite who argue that the frame rate is not necessarily defined by the measurement rate .",
    "specifically , the spatial bandwidth of the video often places an upper - bound on its temporal bandwidth as well . intuitively , the idea here is that the larger the pixel size ( or smaller the spatial bandwidth ) , the greater the motion to register a change in the scene .",
    "hence , given a scene motion in terms of pixels / second , a suitable notion of frame rate is one that ensures sub - pixel motion between consecutive frames .",
    "this notion is more meaningful since it intuitively weaves in the observability of the motion into the definition of the frame - rate . under this definition ,",
    "we wish to find the largest window size @xmath143 such that there is virtually no motion at full resolution ( @xmath64 ) . in practice ,",
    "an estimate of @xmath144 can be obtained by analyzing the preview frames .",
    "hence , given a total number of @xmath60 compressive measurements , we ultimately recover @xmath145 full - resolution frames .",
    "note that a smaller value of @xmath144 would decrease the amount of motion associated with each recovered frame ; this would , however , increase the computational complexity ( and memory requirements ) substantially as the number of full - resolution frames to be recovered increases . finally",
    ", the choice of @xmath144 is inherently scene - specific ; scenes with fast moving highly textured objects require a smaller @xmath144 as compared to those with slow moving smooth objects .",
    "the choice of @xmath144 could potentially be made time - varying as well and derived from the preview ; this showcases the versatility of having the preview and is an important avenue for future research .",
    "we are now ready to detail the final stage of cs - muvi .",
    "assume that @xmath144 is chosen such that there is little to no motion associated with each preview frame .",
    "next , associate a preview frame with a high - resolution frame @xmath146 , @xmath147 by grouping @xmath148 compressive measurements in the immediate vicinity of the frame ( since @xmath149 ) . then , compute the optical - flow between successive ( up - scaled ) preview frames .",
    "we can now recover the high - resolution video frames as follows .",
    "we enforce sparse spatio - temporal gradients using the 3d total variation ( tv ) norm .",
    "we furthermore consider the following two constraints :    consistency with the acquired cs measurements , i.e , @xmath150 , where @xmath151 maps the sample index  @xmath47 to the associated frame index  @xmath152 , and    estimated optical - flow constraints between consecutive frames .",
    "together , we arrive at the following convex optimization problem : @xmath153 \\!\\text{subject to } & \\!\\!\\ !",
    "\\left\\| { \\ensuremath{\\left\\langle\\phi_t,{{\\bf x}}_{i(t)}\\right\\rangle } } - y_t   \\right \\|_2 \\le \\epsilon_1 ,   \\\\ & \\!\\!\\ !",

    "the specific technique that we employed was by variable splitting and using alm / admm .    the parameters @xmath154 and @xmath155 are indicative of the measurement noise levels and the inaccuracies in the brightness constancy , respectively .",
    "@xmath154 captures all sources of measurement noise including photon , dark , and read noise .",
    "photon noise is signal dependent .",
    "however , in an spc , each measurement is the sum of a random selection of half the micromirrors on the dmd . for most natural scenes",
    ", we can expect the measurements to be tightly clustered  to be more specific , around one - half of the total light - level of the scene .",
    "hence , the photon noise will have nearly the same variance across the measurements .",
    "hence , for the spc , all sources of measurement noise can be clubbed into one parameter @xmath154 which is set via a calibration process .",

    "an important direction for future research is the design of imaging architectures , signal models and recovery algorithms to obtain videos at this spatial resolution ( and say , 30 fps temporal resolution ) . the key stumbling block for an spc - based approach for solving this is the measurement bandwidth which , for the spc , is limited by the operating rate of dmd .",
    "an approach to increasing the measurement rate is by using a multi - pixel architecture @xcite .",
    "one way to interpret such imagers is to think of each pixel on the sensor as an spc .",
