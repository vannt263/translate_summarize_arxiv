    "in the limit of a large number of colors @xmath1  @xcite , qcd reduces to an effective theory of the weakly interacting mesons  @xcite . then the mass of a baryon is proportional to @xmath1 and the baryons can emerge as solitons of the effective theory  @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that the solitons are important ingredients of the strong interaction at low energies same as the chiral symmetry .",
    "some effective models of qcd in low energies region have these feature .",
    "the skyrme model  @xcite is a pure mesonic theory and has been investigated in this context  @xcite .",
    "the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite and the chiral quark soliton model ( cqsm )  @xcite have been studied from a viewpoint of the quark model .",
    "usually these models are solved by means of the hedgehog anstz and the cranking method for the non - strange baryons ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) . for the hyperons ( @xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath6,@xmath7 ) , in addition , the embedding of su(2 ) meson field to su(3 ) one is assumed .    in the previous works",
    "@xcite , we investigated the validity of the hedgehog anstz for the octet and decuplet baryons in the su(3 ) cqsm .",
    "the isospin vector of the profile function takes the non - hedgehog shape for the hyperons and the hedgehog one for the non - strange baryon .",
    "and the radial component of the profile function for the hyperons approaches to the center of the soliton compared with the non - strange baryon .",
    "thus , the shape of the soliton changes according to the baryon state .",
    "these nature of the soliton is due to the quark mass in the body fixed frame .",
    "the flavor rotation into strange direction rearranges the flavor su(3 ) quarks ( u , d , s ) and couple the ( u , s ) or ( d , s ) quarks as a su(2 ) doublet in this frame .",
    "thus the masses of the doublet are asymmetric under a su(2 ) transformation .",
    "that is reasonable , because su(2 ) is the @xmath8 or @xmath9 subgroups of su(3 ) and the asymmetry is a su(3 ) symmetry breaking due to the mass difference @xmath10 of s and u quarks .",
    "the non - hedgehog shape of soliton in our approach reflects the asymmetry and the shrink is due to the strange quark mass .",
    "the approaches using the hedgehog anstz treat the doublet as su(2 ) symmetric commonly to the octet and decuplet baryons and incorporate the su(3 ) symmetry breaking by a perturbation with respect to the mass difference @xmath10 .",
    "this approach reproduces the mass difference between baryons but give the too large absolute values .    on the other hand ,",
    "our approach prepares the doublet and the soliton for every baryon states and incorporate the su(3 ) symmetry breaking at the soliton level in advance . as a result",
    "the hilbert space of the soliton+quark system is enlarged .",
    "our procedure reproduces both the absolute values and the mass differences between hyperons  @xcite .",
    "however , it gives the large absolute values only for the non - strange baryon masses .",
    "it is because that there is no difference between our approach and other method using the hedgehog anstz for the non - strange baryons .",
    "for the nucleon mass , there are several attempts to resolve the too large prediction in the soliton models . in the skyrme model , the quantum corrections to the nucleon mass due to the meson fluctuations around the hedgehog soliton",
    "have been evaluated  @xcite . in the context of the quark model ,",
    "the same corrections are estimated in the njl model  @xcite .",
    "the corrections give large negative contributions to the non - strange baryon masses , and their results are in good agreement with the experimental values .",
    "the contributions are called the casimir energies .",
    "their analyses are valid for the non - strange baryons in our approach . for the hyperons",
    ", however , the non - hedgehog soliton requires some modifications on their procedure .",
