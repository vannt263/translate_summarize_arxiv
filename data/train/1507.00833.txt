    "the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture  @xcite states that , if the correlation length of a @xmath13-dimensional finite - temperature gauge theory with a given symmetry group @xmath14 diverges at the transition point , then the gauge theory belongs to the same universality class of the @xmath15-dimensional spin model possessing the center of the group @xmath14 as global symmetry .",
    "this connection at criticality is relevant for a large class of gauge systems and turns out to be fundamental in understanding the deconfinement phase transition of heavy colored charges , _",

    "the validity of the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture in presence of an infinite - order phase transition is yet to be verified .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of the deconfinement phase transition in the finite - temperature @xmath2 @xmath0 lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) .",
    "if the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture holds , this theory should belong to the universality class of the @xmath16 @xmath17 model , which is known to undergo a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt )  @xcite phase transition .",
    "this means that the two models should exhibit the same critical indices , thus implying a common dynamical behavior at criticality . in general ,",
    "critical indices are extracted from the study of the dependence of the order parameter on the couplings of the theory near the transition point . in finite - temperature @xmath2",
    "@xmath0 lgt , as well as in the @xmath16 @xmath17 spin model , due to the mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite , no spontaneous symmetry breaking can occur and , consequently , there exist no order parameter . a critical index",
    "can nevertheless be defined in @xmath2 @xmath0 through the correlation function of two polyakov loops , which is the counterpart of the spin - spin correlator in the @xmath16 @xmath17 model .",
    "indeed this correlation function decreases with a power law for @xmath18 , thus implying a logarithmic potential between heavy electrons , @xmath19 @xmath20 being the distance between test charges . the critical index @xmath21 is known from the renormalization group ( rg ) analysis of ref .",

    "if it coincides with that of @xmath16 @xmath17 , the indices @xmath28 and @xmath27 must be calculated and compared with 1/4 and 1/2 , respectively   will stand for @xmath29 . ] .    on the analytical side , parga studied the @xmath2 @xmath0 lgt in the lagrangian formulation  @xcite , explaining that at high temperatures the system becomes effectively two - dimensional and , in particular , the monopoles of the original @xmath0 gauge theory become vortices of the @xmath16 system . the partition function turns out to coincide ( at the leading order of the high - temperature expansion ) with that of the @xmath16 @xmath17 model in the villain representation , thus supporting the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture . in the rg study of refs .",
    "@xcite , high - temperature and dilute monopole gas approximations were used for the villain formulation of finite - temperature @xmath2 @xmath0 , which helped to derive a scaling law for the effective coupling between polyakov loops with the lattice spacing .",
    "the resulting rg equations were shown to converge rapidly with the iteration number to the rg equations of the @xmath16 @xmath17 model .",
    "this represents a strong indication that , indeed , the nature of the phase transitions in the two models is the same .",
    "moreover , since the scaling with the lattice spacing coincides in the two cases , one concludes that the critical index @xmath27 is the same in the two models .",
    "the critical points and the index @xmath28 in the villain formulation of finite - temperature @xmath2 @xmath0 have been determined for various values of @xmath30 in  @xcite , via numerical analysis of the rg equations , confirming that @xmath31",
    ".    on the numerical side , evidences that the deconfinement transition in the @xmath2 @xmath0 lgt belongs to the universality class of the @xmath16 @xmath17 model come from our study of the phase transitions in @xmath2 @xmath32 lgt  @xcite for large values of @xmath33 .",
    "these models exhibit two separate bkt - like phase transitions at critical couplings , say , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with @xmath36 .",
    "while @xmath34 diverges with @xmath33 , the critical coupling @xmath35 seems to converge to a value , which is expected , on general grounds , to represent the critical point of the @xmath2 @xmath0 lgt .",
    "moreover , it turns out the critical indices at the transition in @xmath35 do not depend on @xmath33 in the interval @xmath37 $ ] and are compatible with the universality class of the @xmath16 @xmath17 model .",
    "the same phenomenon occurs in the @xmath16 @xmath32 spin models for large @xmath33 .",
    "this strongly suggests that @xmath2 @xmath0 near criticality belongs to the universality class of the @xmath16 @xmath17 model .",
    "the first direct simulation of @xmath2 @xmath0 on the lattice was performed on @xmath38 lattices with @xmath39 and @xmath40 in  @xcite .",
    "these authors confirmed the expected bkt nature of the phase transition in the gauge model , but reported a critical index almost three times larger than that predicted for the @xmath16 @xmath17 model , @xmath41 .",
    "the more recent analytical and numerical study of ref .",
    "@xcite indicated that , at least in the limit of vanishing spatial coupling , @xmath42 , _",
    "i.e. _ on an anisotropic lattice with decoupled space - like plaquettes , the @xmath2 @xmath0 lgt exhibits the same critical behavior of the @xmath16 @xmath17 spin model .",
    "numerical simulations of the isotropic model , on lattices with @xmath43 and spatial extension up to @xmath44 , revealed instead that @xmath45 , which is still far from the @xmath17 value  @xcite , thus leaving open the question about the universality class of @xmath2 @xmath0 lgt with nonvanishing @xmath46 .    a possible explanation for this mismatch at large @xmath30 can reside in the infinite order nature of the bkt transition .",
    "indeed , the exponential divergence of the correlation length in a bkt transition implies a very slow , logarithmic convergence to the thermodynamic limit in the vicinity of the transition . as a consequence ,",
    "very large volumes are required in order to enter the scaling region and safely extract critical indices .    in  @xcite we developed a strategy based on duality , according to which",
    "@xmath32 lgts were mapped into spin models .",
    "this opened the way to the use of cluster algorithms , which facilitated the access to larger volumes , thus improving the description of criticality . in the present work",
    "we adjust that strategy to the study of the critical behavior of the @xmath2 @xmath0 lgt .",
    "this goes through the following steps :    * calculate the disorder operator in the dual formulations of the @xmath16 @xmath17 spin model and in the @xmath2 @xmath0 lgt in the dilute gas approximation . *",
    "derive and study the rg equations in the villain formulation ; compute the critical indices @xmath27 and @xmath28 and give an analytical prediction for the index @xmath47 related to the leading logarithmic correction .",
    "+ this is the subject of section  2 .",
    "the main conclusion of these analytical investigations is that the critical behavior of the disorder operator of the @xmath2 @xmath0 lgt is governed by the critical behavior of the corresponding operator in the @xmath16 @xmath17 model .",
    "therefore , the universality problem can be studied with the help of the disorder operator on the same theoretical footing as with the help of the polyakov loop correlation function .",
    "* use the cluster algorithm in the dual formulation of @xmath2 @xmath0 to determine the second moment correlation length and to locate the critical points of the deconfinement transition ; then , compute the critical indices from the large distance behavior of the disorder operator .",

    "we want to calculate the disorder operators  ( [ disorder_xy ] ) , ( [ disorder_u1 ] ) and derive rg equations from an effective coupling which describes the behavior of these operators near criticality . for simplicity",
    "we give details of the derivation for the @xmath17 model and then explain how it can be extended to @xmath0 lgt at finite temperature .",
    "when both couplings are large , it is customary to use the villain approximation , _ i.e. _ @xmath64 the villain model , obtained by taking the approximation ( [ ptvillaindef ] ) , is generally accepted to have the same universal properties as the original model  @xcite .",

    "substituting  ( [ ptvillaindef ] ) into the partition function  ( [ zdual_u1 ] ) , we use the poisson summation formula to perform the summation over the variables @xmath67 . in the case of the @xmath17 model ,",

    "( [ beta_eff ] ) between the length scales @xmath82 and @xmath83 , see _ e.g _  @xcite . denoting @xmath84 ,",
    "one finds @xmath85 these equations coincide with the conventional rg equations for the @xmath17 model .",
    "this should not come as a surprise , because @xmath81 derived above equals the corresponding effective coupling for the spin - spin correlation and for the twist free energy up to @xmath86  @xcite .    to extend this result to the finite - temperature @xmath0 lgt",
    ", we use the disorder operator  ( [ disorder_u1 ] ) and calculate it in the anisotropic model  ( [ zdual_u1 ] ) .",
    "the calculations follow closely the ones for the twist free energy  @xcite and lead to the same expression , again up to @xmath86 , for the @xmath81 that controls the behavior of the twist ( see formula  ( 24 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . hence , all the analysis of  @xcite remains valid for the disorder operator  ( [ disorder_u1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the fixed point of rg equations scales with @xmath30 as @xmath87    an important consequence , relevant for our study , concerns the fall - off of the two - point disorder operator and the corresponding second - moment correlation length .",
    "taking the sources in  ( [ disorder_gen ] ) in the form @xmath88 we find the leading term to be @xmath89 the index @xmath28 for all @xmath30 is found to be @xmath90 since at the critical point @xmath81 takes the fixed point value  ( [ beta_fixed ] ) , we finally obtain the expression for the index @xmath28 at the phase transition point , @xmath91 in particular , it leads to @xmath31 when @xmath92 , _ i.e. _ the value that equals the conventional value obtained from the spin - spin correlation function .",
    "the leading logarithmic correction to the power - like fall - off can also be easily computed at the critical point following the standard scheme ( see , for instance , section  4 of @xcite ) , @xmath93 where @xmath94 note that , @xmath47 being negative , the leading logarithm appears in the denominator , in contrast to the spin - spin correlation function .",
    "the above observations imply that such rg - invariant quantities , like the second - moment correlation length and the binder cumulant , take universal values that are independent of @xmath30 and are known for the @xmath17 model  @xcite .    in the next section",

    "this remains true for all values of @xmath100 and might indicate some important property of the disorder operator which we miss at the moment .    summarizing , we would like to stress that this work , together with our previous studies , leaves little doubt , if any , that the deconfinement phase transition in finite - temperature @xmath2 @xmath0 lgt belongs to the universality class of the @xmath16 @xmath17 model , thus supporting the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture .",
