    "we notice also that there are some available mathematica @xcite and matlab @xcite packages for the numerical evaluation of @xmath0 . ) in this context , the recent work of penson and grska @xcite is certainly interesting and relevant since they describe a formal solution of eq .",
    "( [ laplace ] ) for any rational @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , they show that a formula presented without proof in a table of inverse laplace transforms @xcite could be used to write [ meijer ] g_l / k(x ) = g_l , k^k,0 ( |    c ( l,0 ) + ( k,0 )    . ) , where @xmath12 is the meijer g - function @xcite and @xmath13 is the list of @xmath5 elements given by ( k , a ) = , , , .",
    "we consider the formula ( [ meijer ] ) an important advance .",
    "since the meijer g - function is available in several computer algebra systems , the function @xmath14 could in principle be evaluated with little programming effort .",
    "we notice that the restriction to rational values of @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ meijer ] ) does not represent any real problem here .",
    "as we will see below , the function @xmath0 is continuous in @xmath7 and , hence , one might compute from eq .",
    "( [ meijer ] ) a rational @xmath7 approximation for @xmath0 with any prescribed accuracy .",
    "penson and grska @xcite use eq .",
    "( [ meijer ] ) to derive other series expression for @xmath14 and to infer some of its properties . certainly , the mathematical literature about the meijer g - function ( see , for instance , @xcite and the references therein ) will be extremely valuable for the derivation of many other properties of @xmath14 defined by eq .",
    "( [ meijer ] ) .    furthermore , since one - sided lvy and mittag - leffler distributions are known to be related @xcite , the formula ( [ meijer ] ) is also relevant for calculating the probability density functions @xmath15 of mittag - leffler distributions with rational index @xmath7 .",
    "we recall that @xmath15 is also defined from its laplace transform as well , [ laplace1 ] _ 0^e^-sx^(r)_(x ) dx= _ n=0^ , for @xmath10 , with @xmath11 . the right - handed side of eq .",
    "( [ laplace1 ] ) is a particular case of the so - called mittag - leffler function @xcite , which reduces to the usual exponential for @xmath16 .",
    "the free parameter @xmath17 can be fixed , for instance , by demanding a given first moment for @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , since we have from eq .",
    "( [ laplace1 ] ) that [ trans ] ^(r)_(q x ) = q^-1 ^(r / q^1/)_(x ) , for any @xmath18 , one can assume @xmath19 without loss of generality . in this case , the superscript is simply dropped .",
    "the respective cumulative distribution functions associated to @xmath3 and @xmath0 are known to be related by @xcite [ feller ] _ ( x ) = 1 - _ ( x^-1/ ) , which leads to [ feller1 ] _ ( x ) = x^-(1 + 1/)g_(x^-1/ ) .",
    "the relation ( [ feller1 ] ) allows the computation of @xmath3 by means of the meijer g - function for rational @xmath7 , thanks to the penson and grska formula ( [ meijer ] ) .",
    "this is a considerable advance since , as in the previous case , no closed form solution of eq .",
    "( [ laplace1 ] ) is known .    however , the condensed and apparently simple form of eq .",
    "( [ meijer ] ) hides a practical pitfall .",
    "the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ meijer ] ) is computationally viable only for modest values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , by using the maple procedure provided by penson and grska @xcite , we can plot the graphics of @xmath20 for @xmath21 $ ] instantaneously in an intel core i7 computer running maple version 14 . in order to generate the same graphics with , for instance , @xmath22 , some cpu minutes are necessary . for @xmath23 , we need almost a half an hour to evaluate a single value of @xmath14 !",
    "we could not evaluate eq .",
    "( [ meijer ] ) for @xmath24 in any reasonable amount of time .",
    "mathematica presents a similar performance .",
    "these restrictions , obviously , jeopardize the practical utility of expression ( [ meijer ] ) since one can not calculate in reasonable time good approximations to the one - sided lvy distribution for any @xmath7 .",
    "one can understand the rapidity with the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ meijer ] ) becomes unpractical when the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 increase by recalling the definition of the meijer g - function @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a carefully chosen integration path on the complex plane .",
    "it is possible also to write the meijer g - function as a sum of @xmath27 terms involving @xmath28 function products as those ones of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) and the generalized hypergeometric functions @xmath29 @xcite . as one can see , when asking maple to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ meijer ] ) for @xmath30 , one is basically demanding the evaluation of an integral with more than five thousands @xmath28 function terms in the integrand , or an intricate combination of more than three thousands generalized hypergeometric functions !",
    "hence , it is not a surprise to have a considerable performance degradation for large values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "another problem with the maple procedure based in eq .",
    "( [ meijer ] ) is that it does not deal efficiently with reducible fractions .",
    "for instance , maple is not able to reduce @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , the numerical evaluation of the former is much more time and memory consuming than the latter .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to show that one can compute numerically , in an effective and efficient way , the probability density functions @xmath0 and @xmath3 with arbitrary real index @xmath33 .",
    "our start point is the mikusinski s integral representation for @xmath0 @xcite [ miku ] g_(x ) = _ 0^ue^-u d , with @xmath2 , where [ u ] u = ( ) ^/(1- ) .",
    "the integral representation ( [ miku ] ) has already proven its relevance .",
    "in fact , mikusinski used it to derive more than 40 years ago the some very useful asymptotic expressions for @xmath0 , namely [ asymp1 ] g_(x ) k , valid for @xmath34 and [ asymp2 ] g_(x ) m x^-(1 + ) , valid for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 it is easy to check from eq .",

    "we show how to use eq .",
    "( [ miku ] ) to evaluate numerically one - sided lvy and mittag - leffler probability densities , their cumulative distribution function , and their derivatives in a very efficient and reliable way .",
    "we notice that one - sided lvy stable distributions can be alternatively expressed by means of fox h - functions @xcite , which are a further generalization of the meijer g - functions ( [ def ] ) , and also by means of wright functions @xcite . unfortunately",
    ", the current knowledge about the analytical structure of these functions is still little developed .",
    "we wish also to stress here that the numerical computation of stable distributions is not a new problem and several algorithms are already available in the literature and even commercially .",
    "in particular , nolan @xcite proposed a robust algorithm based on the integration of the so - called zolotarev s ( m ) representation for stable distributions , which is the base of mathematica @xcite and matlab @xcite packages .",
    "an updated reference list on the subject can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , as we will see , mikusinski s representation ( [ miku ] ) allows the numerical evaluation of one - sided lvy stable and mittag - leffler distributions with little programming and computational efforts and with the same accuracy of these specialized packages .",
    "furthermore , from the mikusinski s representation one will be able to derive some asymptotic expressions with special relevance to physical applications .",
    "the mikusinski s integral representation ( [ miku ] ) involves a simple proper integral of a smooth function on the interval @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to obtain from eq .",
    "( [ miku ] ) some analogous formulas for the derivatives of @xmath0 and its cumulative distribution function @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 is given by eq .",

    "although the position of such maximum does depend on @xmath7 and @xmath42 , its value ( @xmath59 ) depends only on @xmath60 . for a given @xmath7 , larger values of @xmath42 displace the maximum towards @xmath61 , while smaller values does towards @xmath62 . if @xmath63 , the unique maximum of @xmath55 is at @xmath62 . for the cumulative distribution function ( [ cdf ] )",
