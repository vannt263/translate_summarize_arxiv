    "[ introduction ]    understanding of the baryon spectrum and searching for the missing nucleon resonances and new exotic states are favored topics in hadronic physics  @xcite .",
    "pion - nucleon ( @xmath16 ) scattering provides us an important tool to study the light baryon spectrum .",
    "most of our current knowledge about the nucleon resonances listed in the review of particle physics by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite was extracted from partial wave analyses of the @xmath16 scattering . as we know",
    ", in the constituent quark model a rich spectrum of nucleon resonances is predicted  @xcite , however , some of them are still missing . to look for the missing resonances and deal with the unresolved issues in hadronic physics , more precise measurements of pion - induced reactions",
    "are suggested recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , meanwhile , reliable partial wave analyses are the same important as the precise measurements for us to extract the information on resonance properties .    in the @xmath16 scattering ,",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath1 reactions are of special interest in hadronic physics .",
    "the reasons are as follows .",
    "i ) only the baryon resonances with isospin @xmath18 contribute to these two reactions due to the isospin selection rule .",
    "thus , the @xmath17 and @xmath1 processes provide us a rather clear place to extract the properties of nucleon resonances without interferences from the @xmath19 states .",
    "ii ) the @xmath17 and @xmath1 reactions can let us obtain information on strong couplings of nucleon resonances to @xmath20 and @xmath21 channels , which can not be obtained in the elastic @xmath16 scattering .",
    "iii ) furthermore , in these reactions one may find evidence of some resonances which couple only weakly to the @xmath16 channel .",
    "hence , many studies about these two reactions have been carried out .    in experiments ,",
    "some measurements of @xmath17 and @xmath1 were carried out about 20 or 30 years ago , the data had been collected in  @xcite . for the @xmath22 reaction",
    ", the data of total cross section and differential cross sections can be obtained in the whole resonance range  @xcite , furthermore , some data of @xmath23 polarization are also obtained in the energy region @xmath24 gev  @xcite . while for the @xmath25 reaction , a few precise data on the differential cross sections and total cross section can be obtained near the @xmath3 mass threshold from crystal ball spectrometer at bnl  @xcite , however , other old data   @xcite might be problematic over the whole energy range for its limited angle coverage and uncontrollable uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "thus , to get reliable information on the resonance properties , a combined analysis of the @xmath17 and @xmath1 reactions is necessary before new precise data are obtained .    in theory ,",
    "various theoretical approaches have been applied to analyze the @xmath17 and/or @xmath1 reactions , such as the chiral unitary model  @xcite , @xmath26-matrix methods  @xcite , dynamical coupled - channel models  @xcite , the bnga approach  @xcite , chiral quark model  @xcite , and other effective approachs  @xcite , etc . however , the analyses from different models claim a different resonance content in the reactions  @xcite . for example , in @xmath17 reaction the large peak near @xmath27 gev is explained as the dominant contributions from both @xmath4 and @xmath28 in ref .",
    "@xcite ; from @xmath13 in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , from @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath13 in ref .  @xcite .",
    "while in @xmath25 reaction , the second bump structure near @xmath27 gev is explained as the dominant contributions of @xmath28 in refs .",
    "@xcite ; in ref .",
    "@xcite it is argued that this structure is mainly caused by @xmath13 ; however , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is predicted that this structure is due to the interference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . to clarify these puzzles in the reactions ,",
    "more theoretical studies are needed .    in this work",
    ", we carry a combined study of @xmath22 and @xmath1 reactions within a chiral quark model .",
    "firstly , we hope to obtain a better understanding of the reaction mechanism for these reactions . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we first extended the chiral quark model to study of the @xmath29 reaction , where we only obtained reasonable results near threshold . in order to further understand the reaction at higher resonance region and get more solid predictions , we need revisit this reaction by combining with the reaction @xmath0 . secondly , we expect to further confirm the extracted properties of @xmath3 from the @xmath30- and @xmath31-meson photoproduction processes in our previous works  @xcite . where we predicted that @xmath3 might be explained as a mixing three - qaurk state between representations of @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 $ ] in the quark model .",
    "however , in the literature it is argued that it may contain a large admixture of pentaquark component for its large couplings to @xmath21 and @xmath20 channels  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 resonance is also considered as a dynamically generated state in the chiral unitary models  @xcite .",
    "finally , we hope to extract some information on @xmath13 in the @xmath22 and @xmath1 reactions and test its properties obtained by us in the @xmath31-meson photoproduction processes , where we found the @xmath13 resonance might favor a narrow width of @xmath14 mev  @xcite , which about a factor of 2 narrower than the world average value from pdg  @xcite .    in the chiral quark model , an effective chiral lagrangian",
    "is introduced to account for the quark - pseudoscalar - meson coupling . since the quark - meson coupling is invariant under the chiral transformation ,",
    "some of the low - energy properties of qcd are retained .",
    "there are several outstanding features for this model  @xcite .",
    "one is that only a very limited number of adjustable parameters will appear in this framework . in particular ,",
    "only one overall parameter is needed for the nucleon resonances to be coupled to the pseudoscalar mesons in the su(6)@xmath34o(3 ) symmetry limit .",
    "this distinguishes from hadronic models where each resonance requires one additional coupling constant as free parameter .",
    "another one is that all the nucleon resonances can be treated consistently in the quark model .",
    "thus , it has predictive powers when exposed to experimental data , and information about the resonance structures can be extracted .",
    "the chiral quark model has been well developed and widely applied to meson photoproduction reactions  @xcite .",
    "recently , this model has been successfully extended to @xmath16 and @xmath35 reactions as well  @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "the model is reviewed in sec.ii .",

    "the @xmath41-channel resonance transition amplitude , @xmath42 , is derived in the su(6)@xmath34o(3 ) symmetric quark model limit . in reality , the symmetry of su(6)@xmath34o(3 ) is generally broken due to , e.g. , spin - dependent forces in the quark - quark interaction . as a result ,",
