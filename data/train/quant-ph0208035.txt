    "for many years the field of quantum chaos @xcite had been the exclusive play  ground of theoretical physics . however , the recent success in experimentally realizing cold atom sources and the newly emerging field of atom optics @xcite are slowly changing this situation in favor of experimental physics .",
    "indeed , a series of atom optics experiments @xcite has verified fingerprints of quantum chaos such as dynamical localization , quantum resonances , quantum dynamics in a regime of classical anomalous diffusion and accelerator modes .",
    "even the reconstruction of the wave function of the kicked particle in amplitude _ and _ phase seems now to be feasible @xcite .",
    "quantum effects are due to quantum interference .",
    "interference phenomena stand out most clearly in the wigner function description of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "this feature serves as our motivation to develop in the present paper the wigner function treatment of a kicked particle .",
    "similar steps have already been taken in @xcite . however , our motivation and ultimate goal is slightly different : we try to gain a deeper understanding of dynamical localization . in this spirit",

    "[ sec : model ] we briefly review the essential ingredients of the delta function kicked particle . here",

    "[ sec : timeev ] we derive the stroboscopic time evolution , that is the maps for the state vector and the wigner function .",
    "we then in sec .",
    "[ sec : resstate ] use the state vector map to review the effect of quantum resonances .",
    "section  [ sec : reswig ] is dedicated to an illustration of this phenomenon and of anti  resonances in wigner phase space .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] by summarizing our main results . in order to keep the paper self  contained we have included the relevant calculations in three appendices .",
    "in the present section we briefly summarize the classical and quantum mechanical model of the kicked particle .",
    "in contrast to the standard treatments we do not specify the form of the kicking potential , except that it should be periodic in space . moreover , we introduce dimensionless variables which reduce the number of parameters .",
    "we first consider the motion of a classical particle of mass @xmath0 , characterized by coordinate @xmath1 and momentum @xmath2 .",
