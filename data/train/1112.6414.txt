    "since the seminal work of gabriel tarde in the late 1800s , the shaping of public opinion through interpersonal influence and conformity has been a subject of significant interest in sociology .",
    "this topic is especially relevant today due to the preponderance of online social media where individuals can influence and be influenced by their numerous and geographically scattered contacts .",
    "public opinion on an issue is often shaped by the actions of groups that rigidly advocate competing points of view .",
    "the most evident example of such a process occurs during elections when multiple parties campaign to influence and win over the majority of voters . in this",
    "as well as other common scenarios , the predominant means of influencing public opinion involves some form of broadcast outreach such as television advertising , public demonstrations etc .",
    "however , even though factors exogenous to the network may have a significant effect on individuals becoming informed and engaged in particular issues , there is reason to believe that large scale changes in behavior or opinion are driven primarily through interpersonal influence events occurring within the network . specifically in the context of rural campaigns , there is evidence that interpersonal channels constitute the dominant pathways for effecting individual behavior change , even when direct external influence is present .",
    "furthermore , with data on social networks becoming increasingly accessible , there has been a surge of interest in understanding how campaigns can be successfully won by leveraging pathways of social influence within the network , thus diminishing the need for , or complementing the effect of broadcast outreach .    motivated by these observations , we study a simple model that enables us to draw useful insights on the evolution of opinions on a social network in the presence of two groups within the network that are committed to distinct , competing opinions on an issue . within the limits of our model ,",
    "one of the questions our work answers is the following .",
    "suppose the majority of individuals on a social network subscribe to a particular opinion on a given issue , and additionally some fraction of this majority are unshakeable in their commitment to the opinion .",
    "then , what should be the minimal fractional size of a competing committed group in order to effect a fast reversal in the majority opinion ?",
    "in addition to answering this question quantitatively , we show the existence of two distinct types of phase transitions that can occur in the space of committed fraction pair values .",
    "we model the dynamics of social influence using a two - opinion variant of the naming game which also corresponds to a special case of the game introduced and studied in .",
    "the same model was referred to as the binary - agreement model in . in this model , at any time , a node possesses either one of the two competing opinions ( i.e. the node is in state @xmath1 or state @xmath2 ) , or both opinions simultaneously ( state @xmath6 ) . in a given time step ,",
    "we choose a node randomly , designate it as the _ speaker _ and choose one of its neighbors randomly and designate it as the _",
    "listener_. the speaker proceeds to convey its opinion to the listener ( chosen randomly if it possesses two ) to the listener .",
    "if the listener possesses this opinion already , both speaker and listener retain it while eliminating all other opinions ; otherwise , the listener adds the opinion to his list .",
    "a table of possible interactions and outcomes between node - pairs is provided in table s1 .",
    "we emphasize that each node interacts and is influenced only by its neighbors on the network .",
    "there is no element in our model that represents an external influence mechanism such as the use of media , public demonstrations , or door - to - door campaigns by members of the competing groups . except for their being un - influencable ,",
    "the committed nodes are assumed to be identical in all other respects to uncommitted nodes .",
    "in particular , committed nodes do not influence their neighbors at a different rate or with a higher strength than uncommitted nodes .",
    "opinion dynamics models involving committed individuals all subscribing to a unique opinion have been studied previously in .",
    "the situation pertinent to this paper - that of two competing committed groups - has received considerably greater attention .",
    "mobilia et al . studied how the presence of zealots ( equivalent to committed individuals ) affected the eventual distribution of opinions ( stationary magnetization ) in the case of the voter model .",
    "they demonstrated that the distribution for a finite sized network was gaussian , with a width inversely proportional to the square root of the number of zealots , and centered at @xmath7 where @xmath8,@xmath9 , represent the fraction of zealots in the two competing states .",
    "similarly to , yildiz et al . studied the properties of steady - state opinion distribution for the voter model with _ stubborn _",
    "agents , but additionally considered the optimal placement of stubborn agents so as to maximally affect the steady - state opinion on the network . interestingly , unlike in the model studied here , in the voter model , no transitions in steady - state magnetization are observed as the committed fraction pair values are smoothly varied .",
    "biswas et al . considered the effect of having rigid individuals in a one - dimensional system of binary opinion evolution , and demonstrated a power - law dependence for the decay of steady - state magnetization on the fraction of rigid individuals.the work done in is similar in spirit to our work here ; however , an important difference is that these studies only considered the infinite - network size limit for complete graphs .",
    "we study finite networks , both complete and sparse , and provide semi - analytical arguments regarding timescales that become relevant when the network size is finite .",
    "first , we study the mean - field version of the model , also being equivalent to the dynamics on the complete graph in the limit of infinite system size .",
    "we designate the densities of uncommitted agents in the states @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath6 by @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we also designate the fraction of nodes committed to state @xmath1 , @xmath2 by @xmath3 , @xmath4 respectively .",
    "these quantities naturally obey the condition : @xmath13 . in the asymptotic limit of network size , and neglecting fluctuations and correlations ,",
    "the system can be described by the following mean - field equations , for given values of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 : @xmath14 the evolution of @xmath12 follows from the constraint on densities defined above . in general , the evolution of the system depends on the relative values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in the case of @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( or equivalently , @xmath17 , @xmath18 )",
    "there is only a single group of committed nodes in the network , all of whom subscribe to the same opinion .",
    "this was the case studied in . in this scenario ,",
    "a transition is observed when this committed group constitutes a critical fraction of the total network .",
    "specifically , the transition point separates two dynamical scenarios in the phase space , @xmath19 , of uncommitted node densities . below the critical value",
    ", the absorbing state ( e.g. , @xmath20 , @xmath21 when @xmath22 ) coexists in phase space with a stable mixed steady - state and an unstable fixed (  saddle \" ) point . at or above the critical value , the latter non - absorbing steady - state and the saddle point cease to exist .",
    "consequently , for a finite system , reaching the ( all @xmath1 ) consensus state requires an exponentially long time when @xmath23 is less than the critical value . beyond the critical value this time grows only logarithmically with network size .",
    "note that this critical value or threshold is analogous to a spinodal point associated with an underlying first - order ( or discontinuous ) transition in equilibrium systems .    ) .",
    "the two lines indicate saddle - node bifurcation lines which form the boundary between two regions with markedly different behavior in phase space . for any values of parameters within the beak ,",
    "denoted as region i , the system has two stable fixed points separated by a saddle point . outside of the beak , in region ii , the system has a single stable fixed point .",
    "the saddle - node bifurcation lines meet tangentially and terminate at a cusp bifurcation point.,width=432 ]    in order to effectively characterize the behavior of the system governed by eqs .",
    "( [ mf ] ) for @xmath24 , we systematically explore the parameter space @xmath5 by dividing it into a grid with a resolution of @xmath25 along each dimension .",
    "we then numerically integrate eqs .",
    "( [ mf ] ) for each @xmath5 pair on this grid , assuming two distinct initial conditions , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , representing diagonally opposite extremes in phase space .",
    "the results of this procedure reveal the picture shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in different regions of parameter space . as is obvious , with non - zero values for both @xmath28 , consensus on a single opinion can never be reached , and therefore all fixed points ( steady - states ) are non - absorbing . with @xmath5 values within",
    "the region denoted as @xmath29 which we refer to as the  beak \" ( borrowing terminology used in ) , the phase space contains two stable fixed points , separated by a saddle point , while outside the beak , in region @xmath30 , only a single stable fixed point exists in phase space .",
    "in region i , one fixed point corresponds to a state where opinion @xmath1 is the majority opinion ( @xmath1-dominant ) while the other fixed point corresponds to a state where opinion @xmath2 constitutes the majority opinion ( @xmath2-dominant ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows representative trajectories and fixed points in phase space , in different regions of parameter space .",
    "similar phase diagrams have been found in other two - parameter systems in different contexts including chemical reactions and genetic switches .    in order to study the nature of the transitions that occur when we cross the boundaries of the beak , we parametrize the system by denoting @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a real number .",
    "then , we systematically analyze the transitions occurring in two cases : ( i ) @xmath33 and ( ii ) @xmath34 .",
    "it can be shown that along the diagonal line @xmath35 the system undergoes a cusp bifurcation at @xmath36 .",
    "the movement of the fixed points as @xmath3 and @xmath4 are smoothly varied along the diagonal line is shown in figure s1 .",
    "henceforth , we denote the value of @xmath3 and @xmath4 at the cusp as @xmath37 . as is well known , at the cusp bifurcation two branches of a saddle - node ( or fold ) bifurcation meet tangentially .",
    "these two bifurcation curves form the boundary of the beak shown in fig .",
    "a detailed analysis demonstrating that @xmath38 constitutes a cusp bifurcation , as well as a semi- analytical derivation of the bifurcation curves is provided in the supporting text s1 ( sections : 1 , 2 , 3 ) .",
    "the cusp bifurcation point is analogous to a second - order ( or continuous ) critical point seen in equilibrium systems , while bifurcation curves are analogous to spinodal transition lines .",

    "the @xmath35 line in parameter space passes through the cusp point and gives rise to a second - order phase transition , while the @xmath41 line passes through a point on the ( right ) bifurcation line giving rise to a first - order phase transition .",
    "here @xmath42 realizations of social influence dynamics were performed for each @xmath40 pair , starting from the initial condition @xmath43 , and the magnetization was measured conditioned on the system remaining in the steady state that it initially converged to .",

    "the location of the transition occurring across the bifurcation curve was obtained using the binder cumulant @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "2(f ) ) , while the location of the cusp point was obtained by using variance of @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) . for both analytical and simulation results ,",
    "the bifurcation curves are obtained by identifying the critical points that lie on linear trajectories in parameter size described by @xmath31 .",

    ", we systematically vary @xmath32 from @xmath48 to @xmath47 to obtain the right bifurcation curve , and therefore by virtue of the @xmath54 symmetry in the system , also obtain the left bifurcation curve .",
    "in particular for a given value of @xmath32 we obtain the transition point by varying @xmath3 ( with @xmath31 ) and measuring the quantity : @xmath55 which we utilize as an order parameter .",
    "the above order parameter is analogous to the  magnetization \" in a spin system as it captures the degree of dominance of opinion @xmath2 over opinion @xmath1 and is conventionally used to characterize the nature of phase transitions exhibited by such a system .",
    "another quantity , the binder cumulant , defined as @xmath56 \\label{bc}\\ ] ] for a system of size @xmath57 , is commonly used to distinguish between different types of phase transitions .",
    "the utility of the binder cumulant comes from the markedly different signatures we expect it to produce along a spinodal trajectory ( e.g. @xmath58 ) - one that passes through the spinodal line - and one along a trajectory that passes through the critical point ( e.g. , along the diagonal , @xmath35 ) .",
    "this difference arises from the following distinction in the evolution of the distribution of @xmath39 , @xmath59 , along these trajectories . along a spinodal trajectory starting from a point where @xmath60 , an initially symmetric ( about @xmath61 ) , bimodal @xmath59 becomes asymmetric and unimodal upon crossing the spinodal line , with the single mode eventually becoming a delta function .",
    "in contrast , along the diagonal trajectory in parameter space , @xmath59 is initially a double - delta distribution ( for @xmath62 ) , symmetric about @xmath61 , and it smoothly transitions to a zero - centred gaussian distribution as the critical point is crossed .",
    "the definition of @xmath45 indicates that @xmath63 for a delta function distribution ( also for a symmetric , double - delta distribution about @xmath61 ) , while @xmath64 for a zero - centered gaussian distribution , and thus readily yields the limiting @xmath45 values at both extremes of the spinodal and diagonal trajectory .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath45 as a function of @xmath3 shows distinct behaviors for @xmath33 and @xmath58 , indicating the existence of a second - order ( or continuous ) transition point at @xmath65 ( fig .  [ fig2](e ) ) and first - order ( or discontinuous ) phase transition points ( fig .  [ fig2](f ) ) along off - diagonal trajectories , respectively .",
    "the second - order critical point @xmath66 converges to the mean - field value , @xmath67 , as @xmath57 becomes larger .",
    "the dip observed in @xmath45 along the off - diagonal trajectory serves as an excellent estimator of the location of the first - order ( spinodal ) transition for a finite network .",
    "thus , to reiterate , for a finite network , the second - order transition point and the first - order transition ( spinodal ) lines are respective analogues of the cusp bifurcation point and the saddle - node bifurcation curves observed in the mean - field case .    the fluctuations of the quantity @xmath39 can also be used to identify a transition point , particularly for the case of the second - order transition . in particular , in formal analogy with methods employed in the study of equilibrium spin systems , the scaled variance : @xmath68 serves as an excellent estimate for the second - order transition point @xmath37 for a finite network . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) , @xmath44 peaks at a particular value of @xmath3 , with the size of the peak growing with @xmath57 ( and expected to diverge as @xmath69 ) . in the case of the spinodal transition",
    ", one studies fluctuations of @xmath39 ( @xmath70 ) restricted to the metastable state until the spinodal point ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) ) at which the metastable state disappears , and fluctuations of @xmath39 in the unique stable state beyond the spinodal point ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) ) .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the bifurcation ( spinodal ) lines obtained via simulations of finite complete graphs by using the binder cumulant ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](f))to identify the location of the spinodal phase transition , and demonstrates that its agreement with the mean - field curves improves as @xmath57 grows .",
    "the cusp points shown here are identified in simulations as the locations where @xmath44 reaches its peak value ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) ) .    in the region within the beak ,",
    "the switching time between the co - existing steady - states represents the longest time - scale of relevance in the system .",
    "the switching time is defined as the time the system takes to escape to a distinct co - existing steady - state , after having been trapped in one of the steady - states ( see fig .  [ fig4](a ) ) .",
    "in stochastic systems exhibiting multistability or metastability , it is well known that switching times increase exponentially with @xmath57 for large @xmath57 ( the weak - noise limit ) furthermore , the exponential growth rate of the switching time in such cases can be determined using the eikonal approximation . the basic idea in",
    "the approximation involves ( i ) assuming an eikonal form for the probability of occupying a state far from the steady - state and ( ii ) smoothness of transition probabilities in the master equation of the system .",
    "this allows the interpretation of fluctuational trajectories as paths conforming to an auxilliary hamilton - jacobi system .",
    "this in turn enables us to calculate the probability of escape allowing an _ optimal fluctuational path _ that takes the system from the vicinity of the steady - state to the vicinity of the saddle point of the deterministic system .",
    "the switching time is simply the inverse of the probability of escape along this optimal fluctuational path .",
    "we defer details of this procedure to supporting text s1 : section 4 . using this approach",
    "we find that for the symmetric case , @xmath71 , the exponential growth rate of the switching time @xmath72 with @xmath73 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "thus , along the portion of the diagonal within the beak : @xmath74 \\label{switchingtime}\\ ] ] outside the beak , the time to get arbitrarily close to the sole steady - state value grows logarithmically with @xmath57 ( not shown ) .",
    "the results presented so far show that there exists a transition in the time needed by a committed minority to influence the entire population to adopt its opinion , even in the presence of a committed opposition ( i.e. in the case where both @xmath75 ) , as long as @xmath76 .",
    "( note that the case @xmath77 was considered in ) .",
    "for example , assume that initially all the uncommitted nodes adopt opinion @xmath2 , and that @xmath78 .",
    "then , the steady - state that the system reaches in @xmath79 time is the one in which the majority of nodes hold opinion @xmath2 . despite the fact that there exist committed agents in state @xmath1 continuously proselytizing their state",
    ", it takes an exponentially long time before a large ( spontaneous ) fluctuation switches the system to the @xmath1-dominant steady - state . for identical initial conditions , the picture is qualitatively the same if we increase @xmath3 keeping @xmath4 fixed , as long as @xmath5 lies within the beak .",
    "however , when @xmath5 lies on the bifurcation curve or beyond , the @xmath2-dominant steady - state vanishes , and with the same initial conditions - where @xmath2 is the initial majority - it takes the system only @xmath79 time to reach the @xmath1-dominant state ( the only existing steady - state ) .",
    "thus , for every value of an existing committed fraction @xmath4 ( @xmath80 ) of @xmath2 nodes , there exists a corresponding critical fraction of @xmath1 nodes beyond which it is guaranteed that the system will reach an @xmath1 dominant state in @xmath79 time , irrespective of the initial conditions .",
    "however , for any trajectory in the parameter space in a region where either @xmath3 or @xmath4 is ( or both are ) greater than @xmath37 , no abrupt changes in dominance or consensus times are observed .",
    "instead , the dominance of @xmath1 or @xmath2 at the single fixed point smoothly varies as the associated committed fractions are varied .",
    "moreover , the system always reaches this single fixed point in @xmath79 time .     and the exponential growth in switching time as a function of distance from the second - order critical point . * ( a ) switches in the value of @xmath39 as a function of time @xmath81 for a sample evolution ( with initial transient removed ) of the system when @xmath82 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "this reflects the system repeatedly switching between the @xmath1-dominant steady - state ( @xmath83 ) and the @xmath2-dominant steady - state ( @xmath84 ) .",

    "using a simple model , we have explored and quantified possible outcomes for the evolution of opinions on a social network in the presence of groups committed to competing opinions . broadly speaking ,",
    "our results indicate that as long as the fraction , @xmath4 , of nodes committed to a given opinion @xmath2 is held fixed at a value less than a critical value @xmath37 , it is possible to induce the network to quickly tip over to a state where it widely adopts a competing opinion @xmath1 , by introducing a fraction of nodes committed to opinion @xmath1 .",
    "the value of the competing committed fraction , @xmath3 , at which this tipping point arises depends on the value of @xmath4 , and is determined by the bifurcation curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "importantly , for a given value of @xmath93 , the excess commitment @xmath94 required for the network to tip over to @xmath1 is a decreasing function of @xmath4 that reaches zero when @xmath95 .",
    "while the critical value @xmath37 itself may depend on the network structure and its size , the feature described above holds for the three different classes of networks studied here . a corollary to this feature",
    "is that if the committed fraction @xmath4 is held fixed at a value greater than pc , increasing the competing committed fraction @xmath3 only yields continuous incremental gains in the adoption of a ( i.e. , no tipping point or discontinuous changes in opinions exist ) .",
    "we analytically determine that @xmath96 for infinite - sized complete graphs , which as observed from our simulation results in figs .",
    "[ figer ] ,  [ figba ] appears to constitute a good upper bound to the value of @xmath37 for sparse networks .",
    "our results could be of utility in situations where public opinion is deadlocked due to the influence of competing committed groups .",
    "perhaps one example of such a situation is the observed lack of consensus in the u.s . on the existence of human - induced climate change .",
    "indeed , there is evidence in this particular case that the commitment of individuals to particular political ideologies may have an effect on their opinions .",
    "another scenario to which our model could bear some relevance is the adoption of competing industrial standards . particularly in situations where a network of entities collaborate or are interdependent",
    ", there is a natural attempt at agreement in standards or protocols between interacting members .",
    "a classic example of this scenario is the case of the sellers screw manufacturing standard that proliferated despite competition from the whitworth standard .",
    "a key factor responsible for the eventual success of the sellers standard was william sellers leveraging of his connections to corporations and manufacturers , whom he persuaded to become adopters of his standard .",
    "furthermore , the network of interdependencies between industries at the dawn of the mass - manufacturing era played an important role in the adoption of the standard becoming widespread .",
    "it should be pointed out that in this case , the uncommitted members of the population initially adhered to neither standard - this situation can however be accommodated in our model by assigning each uncommitted his own unique  opinion \" to begin with in close analogy to initial conditions for the original naming game .",
    "a more recent example of such a scenario is the competition between flash and html5 in web - development .",
    "there is speculation that flash , which until recently was the predominant platform for animated web content , is gradually ceding its dominance to html5 as a result of the increasing market - share of apple s mobile devices which exclusively support the latter .    a potential competition between dc fast charging standards is also expected as electric vehicles become increasingly popular with consumers .",
    "the front - runners in the mass manufacture of electric vehicles have opted for the chademo standard , and charging stations compatible with the standard have begun proliferating in the us , europe and japan .",
    "an alternative to chademo currently being developed by the society for automotive engineers ( sae ) , which governs the development of standards in the us automotive industry , is being touted by some car manufacturers as more cost effective as well as technologically superior . however , by the time the first cars employing the sae standard hit the market , chademo charging stations are expected to be rather widespread , thus making a competition between the two inevitable . as new collaborations are forged between car - makers especially in the area of electric vehicle development ( in addition to collaborations with energy suppliers ) , the outcome of this competition could be significantly influenced by manufacturers who are already committed to one of the two standards through their investment in them .",
    "to conclude , we have presented results from a simple , abstract model for understanding how opinions on a social network evolve through social influence when there are multiple groups within the network dedicated to competing opinions . despite the simplicity of our model , we believe the insights provided here form a useful theoretical complement to data - driven studies and randomized evaluations aimed at understanding the spread of opinions .     and @xmath92 for two @xmath97 pairs . in each case @xmath98 and @xmath52 .",
