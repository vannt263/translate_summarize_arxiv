    "the proof of ( [ eq : first ] ) for _ unconditional _ sets and log - concave measures was given in @xcite as well :    [ thm : uncond ] let @xmath9 be a convex set and let @xmath10 be a log - concave measure on @xmath11 , and assume that both are invariant under coordinate reflections . then @xmath12 is a log - concave function .",

    "here @xmath16 is the lebesgue measure , so theorem  [ thm : main ] is an analog of ( [ eq : first ] ) for _ uniform _ measures  with density @xmath17 .",
