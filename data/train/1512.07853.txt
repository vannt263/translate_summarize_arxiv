    "the biggest triumph of the lhc run i was the discovery of the standard model ( sm ) like higgs boson with mass about 125 gev @xcite .",
    "the signal - strength data and the spin - parity of the observed 125 gev particle have all indicated that it is very close to the sm higgs boson @xcite . after a shutdown for 2 years , the run ii started with a high expectation . just with an accumulated luminosity of about 3 fb@xmath3 at @xmath4 tev",
    ", both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite showed a hint of a new particle at about 750 gev decaying into a photon pair .",
    "the particle is likely to be a scalar boson or a spin-2 particle .",
    "we focus on the scalar boson scenario in this paper .",
    "with a luminosity of 3.2 fb@xmath3 , the atlas collaboration found a resonance structure at @xmath5 gev with a local significance of @xmath6 , but corresponding to @xmath7 when the look - elsewhere - effect is taken into account @xcite .",
    "the cms collaboration also reported a similar though smaller excess with a luminosity of 2.6 fb@xmath3 at @xmath8 gev with a local significance of @xmath9 but a global significance less than @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "also , in the analysis of atlas a total width of about 45 gev is preferred @xcite .",
    "these data could be summarized as follows : @xmath11 the uncertainties shown are @xmath12 corresponding to 95% cl .",
    "note that we estimate the best - fit cross section from the 95%cl upper limits given in the experimental paper , by subtracting the `` expected '' limit from the `` observed '' limit at @xmath13 gev for atlas ( cms ) .",
    "although this hint for a new resonance is still very preliminary , it has stimulated a lot of phenomenological activities , bringing in a number of models for interpretation .",
    "the first category is the higgs - sector extensions , including adding singlet higgs fields @xcite , two - higgs - doublet models and the mssm @xcite .",
    "but in general it fails to explain the large production cross section of @xmath14 in the conventional settings , unless additional particles are added , for example , vector - like fermions @xcite .",
    "another category is the composite models @xcite that naturally contain heavy fermions , through which the production and the di - photon decay of the scalar boson can be enhanced .",
    "other possibilities are also entertained , such as axion @xcite , sgoldstini @xcite , radion / dilaton @xcite , and other models @xcite .",
    "more general discussion of the di - photon resonance or its properties can be found in refs .",
    "the generic feature of the suggested interpretations is to enhance the production cross section of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the 750 gev scalar or pseudo - scalar boson , by additional particles running in the @xmath17 decay vertex and/or @xmath18 production vertex .",
    "another generic feature though not realized in the cms data is the relatively broad width of the particle , which motivates the idea that this particle is window to the dark sector or dark matter @xcite .    a possible interpretation for this 750 gev particle can be an @xmath0 isospin - singlet scalar .",
    "in this interpretation , a general feature is that the singlet @xmath19 mixes with the sm higgs doublet @xmath20 through an angle @xmath1 due to the cubic and quartic potential terms such as @xmath21 .",
    "further , we note that the singlet may also have renormalizable couplings to new vector - like leptons and quarks @xcite .",
    "we assume after mixing the lighter boson is the observed sm - like higgs boson @xmath22 at 125 gev while the heavier one @xmath23 is the one hinted at 750 gev .",
    "thus , the 750 gev scalar boson @xmath23 opens the window to another sector containing perhaps dark matter ( dm ) and other exotic particles . in our previous global fits to the higgs - portal type models with the sm higgs mixing with a singlet scalar boson with all the higgs boson data from run i @xcite",
    ", we have constrained the parameter space of a few models with a singlet scalar . in the higgs - portal singlet - scalar models with hidden sector dm , there are no new contributions to the @xmath24 and @xmath25 vertices beyond the sm contributions , and the mixing angle @xmath1 is constrained to @xmath26 at 95% cl . however , in those models with vector - like leptons ( quarks ) the mixing angle can be relaxed to @xmath27 at 95% cl .",
    "the implication is that the 750 gev scalar boson @xmath23 can be produced in @xmath28 fusion as if it were a 750 gev sm higgs boson but with a suppression factor @xmath29 if there are no vector - like quarks running in the @xmath30 vertex .",
    "additional contributions arise when there are vector - like quarks running in the loop .",
    "similarly , the decay of the scalar boson @xmath23 behaves like a 750 gev sm higgs boson with each partial width suppressed by @xmath29 if there are no vector - like leptons or quarks running in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 vertices . if this is the case the branching ratio @xmath32 , which is too small to explain the resonance . in this work",
    ", we consider vector - like leptons and vector - like quarks that can enhance the @xmath33 decay substantially to give a large production cross section for @xmath34 .",
    "vector - like fermions are quite common in a number of extensions of the sm with various motivations .",
    "although we can introduce vector - like fermions in an _ ad hoc _ and phenomenological way in order to explain the 750 gev diphoton excess , their existence can be understood at theoretically deeper levels .",
    "they appear naturally in models with new chiral @xmath35 gauge symmetries in order to cancel gauge anomalies @xcite , in non - abelian gauge extensions such as @xmath36 model ( the so - called 3 - 3 - 1 model where gauge anomalies cancel when three generations of fermions are considered ) @xcite , or in flavor models for fermion masses and mixing @xcite , to name a few explicit models in the context of 750 gev diphoton excess . in such models",
    ", one can in particular forbid large bare masses of the vector - like fermions if they are chiral under this new @xmath35 gauge symmetries , and thus motivate their masses fall into the range we need to accommodate the 750 gev diphoton excess .    in this paper ,",
    "we interpret the @xmath37 gev di - photon resonance by introducing an @xmath0 singlet taking fully account of its mixing with the sm doublet .",
    "we show that the large production cross section can be explained if the singlet scalar has renormalizable couplings to the vector - like leptons and quarks .",
    "we further show the possibly large total width can be accommodated if @xmath23 substantially decay into non - sm particles such as dark matters .",
    "the organization is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe briefly the framework of the sm higgs mixing with a singlet scalar that couples to new vector - like fermions . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the numerical results for the 750 gev resonance including the constraints from the properties of the 125 gev sm higgs - like scalar boson .",
    "then we conclude in sec . iv .",
    "if there are extra vector - like fermions with renormalizable couplings to a singlet scalar @xmath19 , could be a remnant of new gauge symmetry breaking . in that case , @xmath19 may carry a new quantum number different from the sm gauge charges  @xcite . ]",
    "these models generically contain two interaction eigenstates states of @xmath38 denoting the remnant of the sm higgs doublet and @xmath19 the singlet .",
    "the two mass eigenstates @xmath39 are related to the states @xmath38 and @xmath19 through an @xmath40 rotation as follows : @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 describing the mixing between the interaction eigenstates @xmath38 and @xmath19 . in the limit of @xmath44",
    ", @xmath45 becomes the pure doublet ( singlet ) state . in this work",
    ", we are taking @xmath22 for the 125 gev boson discovered at the 8-tev lhc run and @xmath23 for the 750 gev state hinted at the early 13-tev lhc run .",
    "we are taking @xmath46 without loss of generality .",

    "monojet events have been searched actively at the lhc , e.g. , at @xmath4 tev @xcite and at @xmath174 tev @xcite by atlas ( cms has similar results ) , in which the 95% cl upper limits on monojet production cross sections due to dm are given .",
    "let us focus on the 13 tev data and , to be more specific , on a particular selection cut ",
    "im1 ( @xmath229 gev and @xmath230 gev ) .",
    "it gives an upper limit of @xmath231 fb .",
    "on the other hand , the production cross section of @xmath23 via gluon fusion is @xmath232 fb , see the first equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : numeric ] ) . in order to radiate an additional energetic gluon from the initial - state gluons ,",
    "the cross section would decrease by a factor of @xmath233 .",
    "therefore , we expect a cross section of order @xmath234 fb for monojet production which is obviously below the current experimental upper limit .",
    "we find that the case at 8 tev would be similar .",
    "therefore , the current production of @xmath23 , which decays dominantly into dm , would still be consistent with the monojet searches at the lhc .",
