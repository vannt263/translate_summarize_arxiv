    "shells are omnipresent in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of spiral and dwarf irregular galaxies . in some systems",
    "most of the ism can be described as an ensemble of interacting shells and supershells ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "1997 ; mashchenko , thilker , & braun 1999 , hereafter mtb ) .",
    "theoretically , many astrophysical phenomena may lead to the formation of expanding hi shells : stellar winds ( weaver et al .",
    "1977 ) , supernova explosions ( cox 1972 ) , the combined action of multiple supernovae and stellar winds in ob associations ( bruhweiler et al . 1980 ) , radiation pressure from the field stars ( elmegreen & chiang 1982 ) and the infall of high - velocity clouds onto the galactic plane ( tenorio - tagle 1981 ) . in more general terms ,",
    "any physical mechanism which is able to drive an expanding supersonic shock wave into the surrounding ism long enough for radiative cooling in the shell of swept - up gas to become significant , will lead to the formation of a relatively thin ( @xmath310% of the shell radius ) and cold ( @xmath4 1001000  k ) expanding hi shell .",
    "( see bisnovatyi - kogan & silich 1995 for a review of shock wave propagation in the ism . )    unfortunately , there are many factors which can complicate the above picture and make the hi shells more difficult to detect .",
    "the blowing out of an interstellar bubble caused by the presence of a sharp density gradient in the surrounding medium makes the shell susceptible to rayleigh - taylor instabilities , which results in its fragmentation .",
    "the propagation of the shock through the clumpy turbulent ism can be another destructive factor .",
    "the shells formed around o and early b stars are expected to be at least partially ionized by the ionizing photons from the star ( weaver et al .",
    "the stratification of the ism structure and the differential rotation of the galactic disk result in the highly aspherical appearance of evolved supershells ( mashchenko & silich 1994 ; silich et al .",
    "the detection of expanding hi shells in edge - on disk systems and in our own galaxy is further hampered by the presence of confusing emission along the line of sight .    as a result",
    ", few hi shells have been detected around stars with strong stellar wind .",
    "there are @xmath430 hi shell detections for wr stars ( arnal & mirabel 1991 , dubner et al .",
    "1992 , pineault et al .",
    "1996 , arnal et al . 1999 ,",
    "cappa et al . 1999 ,",
    "gervais & st - louis 1999 , and references therein ) , and just a few shell candidates for o stars ( van der bij & arnal 1986 ; benaglia & cappa 1999 and references therein ) and b stars ( dubner et al . 1992 ) .",
    "pearson correlation coefficient based algorithms can be successfully used for the automatic recognition of complex kinematic structures in the radio data - cubes ( thilker , braun , & walterbos 1998 ; mtb ) .",
    "a cross - correlation approach is tolerant to the partial fragmentation and ionization of the shell , to the mild distortion of its shape and to the presence of slowly varying background emission ( mtb ) .    in this article",
    "we describe an object recognition code for the automatic detection of the expanding hi shells .",
    "the code uses the pearson correlation coefficient as a measure of similarity between the data and a simple model of the shell .",
    "we assume that all the swept - up gas is located in a relatively thin spherical shell .",
    "if @xmath5 is the radius of the shell and @xmath6 is the gas density in the surrounding medium , then the total shell mass is equal to @xmath7 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath8 for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the density of the shell gas and @xmath11 is the thickness of the shell . then @xmath12 .",
    "the gas density jump condition for an adiabatic shock gives us an estimate for the density ratio : @xmath13/[(\\gamma + 1)m^2]$ ] , where @xmath14 is the adiabatic index and @xmath15 is the mach number for the shock ( landau & lifshitz 1959 , p.  331 ) .",
    "finally , for a monoatomic gas ( @xmath16 ) we obtain @xmath17 for a strong shock ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 for a relatively weak @xmath20 shock .",
    "the relative shell thickness values @xmath21 thus obtained should be considered as an upper limit for the shells significantly affected by the radiative cooling .",
    "therefore we adopt a constant value of @xmath22 in our code as a reasonable guess for both mildly supersonic radiative shocks and adiabatic shocks .",
    "we consider the simple situation for which the radial velocity of an object ( hii region , o or b star , etc . ) is known . in this case",
    "the direct computation of the correlation coefficient for all possible values of the parameters is feasible .",
    "we vary explicitly the following five shell parameters : radius @xmath5 , expansion velocity @xmath23 and image pixel coordinates of the shell center @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 corresponding to the galactic coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and systemic radial velocity of the shell @xmath29 . to restrict the range of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    ", we demand that our object be located within the shell boundaries : @xmath30/r^2 + ( z_0-z_*)^2/v_e^2 \\le 1 $ ] , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the pixel coordinates of the object , and @xmath5 and @xmath23 are in image pixel units .",
    "the linear invariance of the pearson correlation coefficient @xmath34 introduces implicitly two additional free parameters : a scale ( corresponding to the integral brightness of the shell ) and an additive constant ( corresponding to the level of the background and/or foreground emission @xmath35 ) . to deal with more complex background distributions",
    "we preprocess the hi data - cube by removing a linear dependency of @xmath35 on the spatial coordinates @xmath36 and @xmath37 within the search area  independently for each velocity channel .",
    "the sensitivity of the shell detection is limited by the presence of noise in the data .",
    "tests show that for all but the smallest shells , the `` structural '' noise ( caused by the filamentary structure of the ism ) dominates over instrumental noise and is a function of the number of non - zero pixels in the projected model cube @xmath38 .",
    "we apply the code to a few `` quiescent '' fields in the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps , e.g. english et al .",
    "1998 ) hi data which contain no known shell generating objects ( o , b , wr stars , snrs , hii regions ) .",
    "the results of the test are used to draw a 99% confidence curve @xmath39 .",
    "the normalized correlation coefficient @xmath40 has a constant signal - to - noise ratio for any @xmath41 value .",
    "high probability shell detections have @xmath42 .",
    "the shell detection procedure consists of three basic steps : ( 1 ) the hi data - cube is preprocessed to remove the linear dependency of @xmath35 .",
    "( 2 ) for each combination of @xmath5 and @xmath2 the projection of the shell model into the observational frame of reference @xmath36@xmath37@xmath43 is performed .",
    "the model is then cross - correlated with the data for all possible 3d translations and the highest value obtained of the correlation coefficient @xmath34 is stored along with the corresponding values of @xmath5 , @xmath2 , @xmath38 and translation vector @xmath44 .",
    "( 3 ) the quantity @xmath40 is plotted against @xmath41 .",
    "the biggest @xmath40 value corresponds to the most probable shell detection .",
    "tests confirm the ability of the code to find an expanding spherical shell in a realistic environment .",
    "when we add model shells with different integral brightness to real hi data - cubes and apply the code , we find that the shell can be reliably detected even if it is too weak to be seen by visual inspection of the cube .",
    "we have tested the shell detection code on four objects : two hii regions ( sh2187 and sh2203 ) and two b1v stars ( hd18352 and bd+56  675 ) .",
    "the hii regions cover a wide range of sizes ( @xmath45 for sh2187 , and @xmath46 for sh2203  sharpless 1959 ) .",
    "sh2187 is known to possess an hi shell ( joncas , durand , & roger 1992 ) .",
    "radial velocity values for all four objects are available ( fich et al .",
    "1990 ; simbad ) .",
    "we have used the cgps hi data , which have high spatial ( @xmath47 ) and velocity ( 1.32  km  s@xmath48 ) resolution .",
    "the search was limited to shells with an expansion velocity @xmath23 in the range 3.3  km  s@xmath49  km  s@xmath48 and an angular radius @xmath5 in the range @xmath50 ( hd18352 and bd+56  675 ) , @xmath51 ( sh2187 ) and @xmath52 ( sh2203 ) .",
    "in all four cases shell candidates with @xmath53 were found .",
    "figures  14 show the detection plots ( panels ( d ) ) and three orthogonal slices through the preprocessed data - cubes ( panels ( a)(c ) ) . in most cases",
    "there is evidence for a multi - shell structure ( figures 1d , 2d , 4d ) .",
