    "uniqueness , continuous dependence , and energy conservation are established in @xcite under the additional condition @xmath9 , which is not satisfied in the neighborhood of the family of gaussian solitary waves given by ( [ soliton - orbit ] ) and ( [ gaussian ] ) . as a result , orbital stability of the gaussian solitary waves was not established for the log  kdv equation ( [ logkdv ] ) , in a sharp contrast with that in the log  nls equation established in @xcite .",
    "a possible path towards analysis of orbital stability of gaussian solitary waves is to study their linear and spectral stability by using the linearized log  kdv equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the schrdinger operator with a harmonic potential given by the differential expression @xmath12 the linearized log  kdv equation ( [ linlogkdv ] ) arises at the formal linearization of the log  kdv equation ( [ logkdv ] ) at the perturbation @xmath13 .",
    "the schrdinger operator @xmath14 is the hessian operator of the second variation of @xmath15 at @xmath16 .",

    "we may hope to develop an ultimate solution of the outstanding problem on the orbital stability of the gaussian solitary waves . indeed ,",

    "therefore , obtaining new estimates for the linearized log  kdv equation ( [ linlogkdv ] ) in a function space with gaussian weights may be useful in the nonlinear analysis of the log  kdv equation ( [ logkdv - w ] ) .",
