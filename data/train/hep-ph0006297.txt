    "nowadays , there are no doubts the model of qcd vacuum as the instanton liquid ( il ) is the most practical instrument on the chiral scale of qcd .",
    "it provides , as the lattice calculations recently confirmed , not only the theoretical background for describing spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( scsb ) but is mostly powerful in the phenomenology of the qcd vacuum and in the physics of light quarks while considered to propagate by zero modes arising from instantons .",
    "the origin of gluon and chiral condensates turns out in this picture easily understandable and both are quantitatively calculated getting very realistic values defined by @xmath1 and parameters of instanton and anti - instanton ensemble , for example , @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the scale for dynamical quark masses , @xmath3 , naturally appears and pion decay constant , @xmath4 , is then transparently calculated .",
    "another significant advantage of this approach is that the initial formulation starts basically from the first principles and subsequent approximations being well grounded and reliably controlled are plugged in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it becomes clear especially in recent years when the impressive progress has been reached in understanding the instanton physics on the lattice @xcite .",
    "further we are summarizing several things we have learned thinking of the il theory and trying to answer the challenging questions .",
    "let us start on that stage of the il approach when its generating functional has already been taken as factorized one into two factors @xmath5 where eventually @xmath6 provides nontrivial gluon condensate and the fermion part @xmath7 is responsible to describe the chiral condensate in instanton medium and its excitations .",
    "it is usually supposed the functional integral of @xmath6 is saturated by the superposition of the pseudo - particle ( pp ) fields which are the euclidean solutions of the yang - mills equations called the ( anti-)instantons @xmath8 here @xmath9 denotes the field of a single ( anti-)instanton in singular gauge with @xmath10 ( for the @xmath11 group ) coordinates @xmath12 of size @xmath13 centred at the coordinate @xmath14 and colour orientation defined by the matrix @xmath15 .",
    "the nontrivial bloc of corresponding @xmath16 matrices of pp is a part of potential @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the pauli matrices , @xmath19 is the t hooft symbol @xcite , @xmath20 is the coupling constant and for anti - instanton @xmath21 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we do not introduce the distinct symbols for instanton ( @xmath22 ) and anti - instanton ( @xmath23 ) and consider topologically neutral il with @xmath24 . utilizing the variational principle the following estimate of @xmath6",
    "was found @xcite @xmath25 with the action of il defined by the following additive functional ) looks like a formula of classical physics although it describes the ground state of quantum instanton ensemble .",
    "intuitively clear , this definition will be still valid even when the wave function is nonhomogeneous with the nonuniformity scale essentially exceeding average instanton size or , precisely speaking , being larger ( or of the order ) than average size of characteristic saturating field configuration .",
    "then each instanton liquid element of such a distinctive size will provide a partial contribution depending on the current state of il , see next section . ] @xmath26 the integration should be performed over the il volume @xmath27 along with averaging the action per one instanton @xmath28 weighted with instanton size distribution function @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the number of flavours .",
    "the constant @xmath33 is defined by the variational maximum principle in the selfconsistent way and @xmath34 with constant @xmath35 depending on the renormalization scheme , in particular , here @xmath36 .",
    "the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 are fixed at the characteristic scale @xmath39 ( an average instanton size ) .",
    "the constant @xmath40 characterizes , in a sense , the pp interaction and eqs .",
    "( [ s]),([si ] ) and ( [ nrho ] ) describe the equilibrium state of il .",
    "the minor modification of variational maximum principle ( see appendix ) leads to the explicit form of the mean instanton size @xmath41 and , therefore , to the direct definition of the il parameters unlike the conventional variational principle @xcite which allows one to extract those parameters solving numerically the transcendental equation only .",
    "the quark fields are considered to be _ influenced _ by the certain stochastic ensemble of pps , eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , while calculating the quark determinant @xmath42 besides , dealing with dilute il ( small characteristic packing fraction parameter @xmath43 ) one neglects the correlations between pps and utilizes the approximation of @xmath44 where the planar diagrams only survive . in addition",
    "the fermion field action is approached by the zero modes what means the quark green function is considered as the superposition of the free green function @xmath45 and fermion zero modes @xmath46 which are the solutions of the dirac equation @xmath47 in the field of ( anti-)instanton @xmath48 centred at @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the current quark mass and the quark zero mode possesses the following analytic form @xmath51_{ic}={\\frac{\\textstyle \\rho}{\\textstyle \\sqrt{2}\\pi |x|(x^2+\\rho^2)^{3/2 } } } \\left[\\hat x~{\\frac{\\textstyle 1\\pm\\gamma_5}{\\textstyle 2}}\\right]_{ij}\\varepsilon_{jd } ~u_{dc}\\ ] ] with the colour @xmath52 and the lorentz @xmath53 indices and the antisymmetric tensor @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , there exists the singular term in the limit @xmath55 but it is selconsistently fixed by the saddle point calculation of quark determinant @xmath56 . in spite of the fact the exact green function ( at @xmath57 ) including the terms of the whole series is well known @xcite and , moreover , the green function of instanton molecule has been also established @xcite , the simple zero mode approximation ( [ gf ] ) is still the most practical in the concrete evaluations . in particular , at @xmath58 the quark determinant reads @xcite @xmath59 @xmath60 where the factor @xmath61 makes the result dimensionless and is also fixed by the saddle point calculation .",
    "amazingly this relatively crude approximation turns out so fruitful to develop ( even quantitatively ! ) the low energy phenomenology of light quarks .",
    "the generating functional beyond the chiral limit was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , the il approach at the present stage of its development looks very indicative , well theoretically grounded and reasonably adjusted phenomenologically .",
    "the proper form of generating functional obtained and its verisimilar parameter dependence indicated provide enough predictive power and justify , hence , the approximations made .",
    "it dictates the improvements to be done within the approach but , on the other hand , calculating some corrections has clearly no serious prospect .",
    "taking this message as a guiding one we are going to demonstrate that amplifying the approach with an _ inverse influence _ of quarks upon the instanton ensemble which is intuitively small effect leads , however , to rather unobvious important conclusions .",
    "we describe this influence ( not getting beyond il and scsb approach ) as a small variation of instanton liquid parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 around their equilibrium values of @xmath64 and @xmath39 being in full analogy with the description of chiral condensate excitations . indeed , the result of nontrivial calculation of the functional integral ( treating substantially from physical view point the zero quark modes in the fermion determinant ) comes to encoding the il state with just those two parameters",
    ". moreover , the il density appears in the approach via the packing fraction parameter @xmath65 only ( clear from dimensional analysis ) what means one independent parameter existing in practice .",
    "it is just the instanton size .",
    "the analysis of the _ quark and il interaction _ is addressed in this paper developing our idea @xcite of phononlike excitations of il resulting from the adiabatic changes of the instanton size .",
    "thus , we will suppose the _ inverse quark influence _ should be described by these deformable ( anti-)instanton configurations which are the field configurations eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) characterized by the size @xmath13 depending on @xmath66 and @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath67 .    the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we discuss the modification of quark determinant when the functional integral is saturated by the deformable modes at the minimal number of flavours .",
    "then in section iii we develop the approximate calculation ( tadpole approximation ) which is based on the saddle point method and the corresponding iteration procedure .",
    "section iv is devoted to the generalization for the multiflavour picture .",
    "the meson excitations of quark condensate and calculation of the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation when it is provided by the mechanism of quark current mass generation related to the phononlike excitations of il are analyzed in section v. the paper includes also appendix where the fault finding reader gets a chance to control the explicit formulae of the il parameters and to improve our calculations if is able .",
    "apparently , the gist of what we discuss here could be illuminated in the following way . saddle point method calculation of the functional integral implies the treatment of the action extremals which are the solutions of classical field equations . for the case in hands",
    "the action @xmath68 $ ] is constructed including the gluon fields @xmath69 , ( anti-)quarks @xmath70 and extremals , which are given by the solutions of the consistent system of the yang - mills and dirac equations . as a trial configuration in the il theory the superposition of ( anti-)instantons which is the approximate solution of the yang - mills equations ( with no reverse influence of the quark fields ) and an external field for the dirac equation",
    "simultaneously is considered .",
    "we  believe it is reasonable to utilize the deformable ( crampled ) ( anti-)instantons @xmath71 as the saturating configurations .",
    "they just admit of varying the parameters @xmath72 of the  yang - mills sector of the initial consistent system in order to describe the influence of quark fields in the appropriate variables for the quark determinant .",
    "taking the action in the form @xmath73 $ ] we would receive the corresponding variational equation for the deformation field @xmath72 which approaches most optimally ( as to the action extremum ) pp at nonzero quark fields . in the field theory , for example ,",
    "the monopole scattering @xcite , the abrikosov vortices scattering @xcite are treated in a similar way . however , for il we avoid the difficulties which come with solving the variational equations if we consider the long - length wave excitations only with the wave length @xmath74 much larger the characteristic instanton size @xmath39 .",
    "indeed , it looks possible because we are searching the kinetic energy of the deformation fields   ( the one particle contributions ) and consider the pair interaction which develops the contact interaction form being calculated in the adiabatic regime @xcite .",
    "let us remind first of all that deriving eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) we should average over the instanton positions in a metric space .",
    "clearly , the characteristic size of the domain @xmath75 which has to be taken into account should exceed the mean instanton size @xmath39 .",
    "but at the same time it should not be too large because the far ranged elements of il are not causally dependent .",
    "the ensemble wave function is expected to be homogeneous ( every pp contributes to the functional integral being weighted with a factor proportional to @xmath76 ) on this scale .",
    "the characteristic configuration which saturates the functional integral is taken as the superposition eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) with @xmath77 of pp in the volume @xmath27 .",
    "it is easy to understand that because of an additivity of the functional eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) describes properly even non - equilibrium states of il when the distribution function @xmath78 does not coincide with the vacuum one and , moreover , allows us to generalize it for the non - homogeneous liquid when the size of the homogeneity obeys the obvious requirement @xmath79 . besides",
    ", we should deal with the weak ( comparing to the instanton @xmath80 ) fields @xmath81 @xmath82 and long - length wave ( on the scale of the instanton size @xmath39 ) perturbations @xmath83 when the ensemble saturating the functional integral is very close to the vacuum ( instanton ) one .",
    "then this smoothness or the adiabatic change of instanton size practically dictates another essential simplification defining everywhere the field in the center of instanton @xmath84 as a characteristic deformation field and the exact instanton definition in the singular gauge , @xmath85 , leads to the following correction to the potential @xmath86 where @xmath87 . keeping ourselves within the precision accepted here we could take @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath89 . on the other hand the most general form of the correction to the instanton field influenced by the quarks might be calculated",
    "if the gluon green function in the instanton medium is known @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the current of external quark source , @xmath92 belongs to the region of long - length wave disturbation and , at last , @xmath93 is the green function of pp in the instanton medium . in fact",
    ", this function is not well defined @xcite but , seems , for the case in hands we could develop the selfconsistent way to calculate the regularized green function .",
    "the nonsingular propagator behaviour in the soft momentum region is defined by the mass gap of phononlike excitations .",
    "fortunately , the exact form of the green function occurs unessential here ( we are planning to return to the problem of regularized green function calculation in the forthcoming publication ) . in the coordinate space",
    "it is peaked around the averaged pp size being in nonperturbative regime and , hence , integral eq .",
    "( [ ggf ] ) is appraised to be @xmath94 appealing now to eq .",
    "( [ pop ] ) we are capable to get immediately for @xmath95 the following equation @xmath96 in fact , the current @xmath97 might be taken  constant in the long - length wave approximation .",
    "then neglecting the gradients the following change appears to be justified everywhere @xmath98 since there is no other fields in the problem at all ( in the adiabatic approximation ) .",
    "the deformable mode contribution to the functional integral ( when the corrections coming from the deformation fields of pp are absorbed ) may be estimated as @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the kinetic coefficient being derived within the quasiclassical approach .",
    "our estimate of it gives the value of a few instanton actions @xmath101 with the coefficient @xmath102 depending quantitatively on the ansatz supposed for the saturating configurations .",
    "although this estimate is not much meaningful because there is no the vital @xmath100 dependence eventually ( becomes shortly clear ) .",
    "thus , this coefficient should be fixed on a characteristic scale , for example @xmath103 if we are planning not to be beyond the precision peculiar to the approach .",
    "actually , it means adding the small contribution of kinetic energy type to the action per one instanton only .",
    "such a term results from the scalar field of deformations and affects negligibly the pre - exponential factors of the functional integral . in one",
    "s turn pre - exponential factors do the negligible influence on the kinetic term as well @xcite . if we strive for to be within the approximation we should retain the small terms of the second order in deviation from the point of action minimum only @xmath104 supposing approximately @xmath105 where @xmath106 and the scalar field @xmath107 is the field of deviations from the equilibrium value of @xmath108 .",
    "consequently , the deformation field is described by the following lagrangian density @xmath109 with the mass gap of the phononlike excitations @xmath110 which is estimated for il with @xmath111 , for example , in the quenched approximation to be @xmath112 if @xmath113 ( for the details see the tables of appendix ) .",

    "we can conclude that the vectors @xmath124 and @xmath95 are , in fact , in one to one correspondence ( of course , being within one loop approximation and up to this unessential colour rotation ) .",
    "thus , the jacobian occurs an unessential constant .",
    "] should be omitted in what follows as discussed above .    analyzing the modifications arising now in the quark determinant @xmath56 we take into account the variation of fermion zero modes resulting from the instanton size perturbed @xmath125 where @xmath126 and because of the adiabaticity it is valid @xmath127 @xmath128 .",
    "the additional contributions of scalar fields generate the corresponding corrections in the factors of the kernels @xmath129 of eq .",

    "it is pertinent to mention here the diakonov - petrov result comes to the play precisely if the scalar field is switched off .    in order to avoid a lot of the needless coefficients in the further formulae we introduce the dimensionless variables ( momenta , masses and vertices ) @xmath139 the fields in turn @xmath140 and eventually for @xmath74 we are using @xmath141 .",

    "( [ dec ] ) .",
    "the functional obtained describes the il state influenced by the quarks when all the terms containing the scalar field are collected ( see also appendix ) .",
    "as mentioned above we believe this influence analogous to the reversal impact of phononlike deformations on the quark determinant does not considerably change the numerical results of the il and scsb theory .",
    "but it is invisible from eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) directly how this smallness is reasoned .",
    "the scalar field enters the generating functional formally at the same order of the @xmath144-expansion as the term providing scsb ( compare the second and third terms of the second exponential function in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) ) .",
    "the suppression arises because the dominant contribution of the yukawa interaction comes from the quark field condensate which maintains the additional @xmath144 smallness .",
    "this result prompts , in fact , rather natural scheme of the approximate calculation of the generating functional @xmath145 if we believe , for example , the first term ascribes some gluon component of the generating functional then being linearly dependent on the scalar field it produces the small shift from the equilibrium value of the instanton size ( @xmath146 ) @xmath147 . and the shift @xmath148 generates the mass term in the quark sector what means the scheme should be pushed forward to the following expression   meson to gain its mass . in the second term such fluctuations are suppressed . ]",
    "@xmath149 thus , we face the conventional mechanism of the mass generation when it is related to the insignificant variation of the equilibrium instanton size @xmath150 ( or , in usual terms , to falling the scalar field condensate down ) produced by the quark condensate .",
    "moreover , it is clear if the variations happen to be of the opposite sign then the field @xmath151 ( the chiral partner of the field @xmath152 ) should develop the true mass . before turning to the mechanism of the mass generation below",
    "let us calculate the quark determinant integrating formally over the scalar field @xmath153 , then find the quark green function in the tadpole approximation and formulate the equation for the saddle point .",
    "it is supposed the phonon component contribution does not affect substantially the results of the scbs theory .",
    "here we are interested in projecting upon the scale inherent for the scalar field .",
    "the integration leads us to the four fermion interaction and the functional integral can not be calculated exactly . however , due to smallness of scalar field corrections we may find the effective lagrangian substituting the condensate value in lieu of one of the pairs of quark lines ( see fig . 1 . )",
    "@xmath154 in such an approach the diagram with four fermion lines in the lowest order of the perturbation theory in @xmath144 is reduced to the two - legs diagram with one tadpole contribution ( there are two such contributions because of two possible ways of pairing ) @xmath155 where the natural pairing definition was introduced @xmath156 it is obvious the factors surrounding @xmath157 has a meaning of quark mass @xmath158 ( the initial mass term contains the factor @xmath159 when the dimensionless variables are utilized , i.e. takes a form @xmath160 . )",
    "we are treating it as the current quark mass since the further calculations show its magnitude gets just within the scale interval commonly accepted for the current quark mass and , moreover , it appears in the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation .",
