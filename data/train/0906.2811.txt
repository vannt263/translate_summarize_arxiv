    "we discovered sn 2005cz on 2005 july 17.5 ut at @xmath38 offset from the nucleus of the elliptical galaxy ngc 4589 .",
    "no object brighter than 18.5 mag was visible at the sn position on 2005 june 20 ( ref .",
    "31 ) .    the discovery and subsequent unfiltered images were taken with a 0.6-m reflector and a ccd ( kodak kaf-1001e ) at itagaki astronomical observatory ( iao ) in yamagata , japan .",
    "the derived magnitudes are approximately consistent with @xmath39 magnitudes .",
    "other imaging observations were performed by the calar alto 2.2-m telescope ( ca2.2 ) equipped with the calar alto faint object spectrograph ( cafos ) in @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath39 and @xmath42 bands , and by the 8.2-m subaru telescope equipped with the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas@xmath43 ) in @xmath40 and @xmath39 bands .",
    "imaging observations with subaru were done in photometric conditions ; standard stars around pg 1525 - 071 in august 2005 and around pg 0942 - 029 in december 2005 were observed for photometric calibration .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the iraf package daophot .",
    "since sn 2005cz was close to the bright core of the host galaxy , we subtracted the host galaxy component prior to the photometry for more reliable photometry .",
    "for the unfiltered images at iao , we used the pilot survey image taken with the same system on 2005 may 25 as the host template . for the ca2.2 and subaru images , we took data of the same field , as well as the standard stars around pg 0918 + 029 , by ca2.2+cafos in a photometric night on 2009 feb 19 and used them as the host galaxy template after point - spread - function - matching .",
    "the derived @xmath39 ( and unfiltered ) magnitudes are shown in the supplementary table 1 .",
    "the other magnitudes are @xmath44 mag , @xmath45 mag , @xmath46 mag on 2005 aug 1 , and @xmath47 mag on 2005 aug 10 . on 2005",
    "jul 27 and dec 27 , the sn was not detected and we just derived @xmath48 upper - limit for the sn luminosity . for the dec 27 data , we derived more reliable upper - limit of the bolometric luminosity ( fig .",
    "4 ) as follows ; first , we subtracted a continuum from the subaru spectrum and then scaled it to the observed upper - limit ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we then integrated the flux at optical wavelengths .",
    "finally , we assumed that the nir contribution was 30% of the optical luminosity , a typical value seen in sne ib / c at late phases@xmath50 .",
    "the early - time spectrum of sn 2005cz was obtained on 2005 jul 28 ut with the 10-m keck i telescope equipped with the low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris@xmath51 ) .",
    "the total exposure time was 500 s. the seeing was @xmath52 and the airmass was relatively large , @xmath53 .",
    "the wavelength resolution measured from sky lines was 9  .",
    "the late - phase spectrum was obtained with subaru+focas on 2005 dec 27 ut .",
    "the total exposure time was 1800 s. the seeing was @xmath54 and the airmass was @xmath55 .",
    "the wavelength resolution was 11  .",
    "these data were reduced with iraf in a standard manner for long - slit spectroscopy .    for the extinction within our galaxy and the host galaxy , we adopted @xmath56 and @xmath57 mag , respectively .",
    "the former is inferred from the infrared dust map@xmath58 , while the latter is estimated from the equivalent width of na i d absorption feature in the early - phase spectrum ( @xmath59 ) and an empirical formula@xmath60 .",
    "although the formula allows for a range of @xmath61 mag , the extinction within the inner @xmath62 of ngc 4589 has been estimated to be @xmath63 mag by the spectrum template fitting@xmath64 .",
    "since the sn position is reasonably separated from the dusty bar near the nucleus of the host galaxy , the extinction should not be large there .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath65 mag as a reference value for the host extinction .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 days as the epoch of the first spectrum ( jul 28 ) because of the overall resemblance of the spectral features with sn ic 1994i at @xmath3 days and with sn ib 2000h at @xmath66 days . this estimate still includes a large uncertainty ; e.g. , the he i line velocities of @xmath67 km s@xmath68 on jul 28 ( supplementary fig .",
    "1 ) would be more typical for sne ib at @xmath69 to @xmath70 days . since the estimation for @xmath1ni mass",
    "is sensitively affected by the explosion date , we also consider an extreme case in which the discovery was close to the explosion date , and give the possible range of @xmath71 ( see fig . 4 legend ) .",
    "anyway , the choice here does not affect our main conclusions .",
    "supplementary table 1 : summary of observation of sn 2005cz    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,^ \" , ]",
    "it is apparently puzzling that sn ib 2005cz appears in the elliptical galaxy ngc 4589 if it is the fe core - collapse event , because elliptical galaxies generally contain only low - mass , old population stars .",
    "recently , hakobyan et al.@xmath30 reexamined the morphology of the host galaxies of 22 core - collapse sne ( i.e. , type ii / ibc ) which had been previously classified as elliptical or s0 galaxies .",
    "they concluded that 19 cases were simply misclassifications of the host galaxy type .",
    "ngc 4589 remains a genuine e2 galaxy .",
    "however , from the literature search related to ngc 4589 , hakobyan et al . pointed out that there is a low ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) activity ( type `` l2''@xmath72 ) , and suggested the host to be a merger remnant .",
    "there is also an evidence for unusual distribution of interstellar dust from hst and akari studies@xmath73 , being consistent with the merger scenario .",
    "thus , the appearance of the sn ib in this particular early - type galaxy may not conflict with the general scenario of stellar evolution and explosion .    according to a population synthesis model for the integrated light from the host galaxy@xmath33",
    ", it has been suggested that about 90% of the host flux is contributed by an old population with life times longer than @xmath74 years ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) , whereas a relatively young population with life times @xmath76 years ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) contributes to the remaining @xmath78% .",
    "thus , it is likely that sn ib 2005cz is the end product of one of these young stars , which were produced by the galaxy merger about @xmath79 years ago .",
    "in addition to sn 2005cz , there are examples of a faint , hydrogen deficient , possibly core - collapse sn which shows the large ca / o line ratios , e.g. , sne 1997d , 2005e , 2005cs , 2005hk , and 2008ha@xmath80 . as discussed below , however , they have very different observational features except for the late - time ca / o ratio .",
    "thus it may not be the case that the origin of the large ca / o ratio and the progenitors are the same for all these sne .",
    "sn 2005hk belongs to a subclass of peculiar sne ia , sn 2002cx - like class@xmath81 , characterized by low luminosities and low expansion velocities ( @xmath82 km s@xmath68 ) .",
    "the early - phase spectra of sn 2005hk are dominated by low - velocity permitted lines of fe , without any resemblance to sn 2005cz whose velocity and spectral features are those of typical sne ib ( supplementary fig .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the progenitor of sn 2005hk is the same as sn 2005cz .",
    "the early spectra of sn 2008 ha are similar to sn 2005hk , but show even much lower velocities ( @xmath83 km s@xmath68 for most lines , and @xmath82 km s@xmath68 for ca ii ir)@xmath84 .",
    "no clear detection of he is reported .",
    "this is totally different from the early spectrum of sn 2005cz that shows strong he lines and the expansion velocity of @xmath85 km s@xmath68 ( supplementary fig .",
    "the low expansion velocity of sn 2008 ha is consistent with the fall - back sn model with a massive , black - hole - forming progenitor rather than the less massive progenitor model@xmath86 .",
    "it has also been claimed to be an explosion of a white dwarf like other sne ia based on detection of silicon and sulfur features in the early - phase@xmath87 .",
    "thus , the origin of sn 2008 ha is still controversial .    adding to this",
    ", we should note that the reported `` late - time '' spectra of sne 2005hk and 2008 ha are not fully nebular ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which is in contrast to the case of sn 2005cz .",
    "thus , it is possible that the o / ca ratio is affected by the attenuation within the ejecta .",
    "this would imply that the weak ( or absence of ) [ o i ] in these sne would not necessarily indicate the small o - layer .",
    "this effect may also appear in sn 2005e to some extent , given its relatively young age ( @xmath88 months ) of the reported late - time spectrum@xmath89 .",
    "our late - time spectrum of sn 2005cz seems genuinely nebular , and thus the large ca / o ratio is more clearly the case than in other examples ( except for sne ii ; see ref . 2 and below ) .",
    "for sne 2005hk and 2008 ha , it is also not clear whether the strong ca lines in the late - phases are emitted from the newly - synthesized materials .",
    "the velocities of the `` nebular '' lines are similar to those in the early - phase spectra@xmath90 .",
    "in contrast , the velocity of the nebular ca lines in sn 2005cz ( @xmath91 km s@xmath68 ) is much lower than that in the early - phase ( supplementary fig .",
    "1 ) , suggesting that the ca lines are emitted from the innermost region of the ejecta where the newly - synthesized ca dominates the emission .",
    "sne 1997d and 2005cs are both faint sne ii with the slow expansion velocities @xmath92 .",
    "although they do show the large ca / o ratio in the nebular spectra , the comparison with sn ib 2005cz should be done carefully .",
    "sne ii generally show the ca / o line ratio being larger than sne ib / c , since ca in the h - rich envelope can also contribute to [ ca ii ] and ca ii ir triplet ( e.g. , ref .",
    "a low mass progenitor is favoured for sn 2005cs , while the progenitor of sn 1997d is still controversial .",
    "these progenitors may or may not be consistent with the ca / o line ratio in the nebular phase . further study including the emission from the h - rich envelope is necessary to use the ca / o line ratio as an indicator of the progenitor mass for sne ii .",
    "detailed composition structure should be the key to the understanding of the progenitor and explosion mechanism of sn 2005cz . deriving the detailed abundance from the nebular spectrum , however ,",
    "is highly model dependent ( e.g. , see the above discussion for sne ii ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no strong si or s line in optical wavelengths in the nebular phase , which could in principal be used to discriminate different scenarios .",
    "the existence of 2005cz - like sne , which have ejected material with little o and a relatively large amount of ca , may have important implications to the chemical evolution of galaxies . in our galaxy ,",
    "a very ca - rich , extremely metal - poor ( emp ) halo star has recently been discovered@xmath93 .",
    "such an emp star may have formed from the debris of 2005cz - like sne .",
    "it would also be interesting to note that some dwarf galaxies contain emp stars whose abundance ratios between the alpha - elements and fe are much smaller than the halo stars@xmath94 .",
    "the oxygen - poor 2005cz - like sne might be related to the formation of such emp stars .",
    "current theoretical models still have lots of uncertainties and further observational constraints are necessary to fully understand the final stage of the evolution of stripped stars of different masses ( see also supplementary fig .",
    "the evolutionary scenario of 1012 @xmath36 we propose in this paper ( paragraph 56 ) is indeed similar to those have applied for ordinary sne ibc from more massive than 12 @xmath36 .",
    "however , it is a new theoretical argument that 1012 @xmath36 low mass models can have distinct properties of low @xmath71 production , low explosion energy , and the large ca / o ( see ref . 2 for the similar conclusions from observations of sne ii ) .",
    "these are quite different from more massive models , and consistent with the new observation of sn 2005cz .",
    "also , our suggestion to connect the explosions in the onemg white dwarfs with sne ib is quite new ( see also ref . 1 ) .",
    "we also note that our discovery of sn 2005cz and the faint nature of the 1012 @xmath36 binary sn may solve the puzzle why sne ib from 1012 @xmath36 binary stars have not been observed .",
    "even though such low mass stars should be more abundant in the universe than more massive stars ( e.g. , the progenitor of sn 1994i ) , they may simply be missed because of faintness .",
    "a close - up plot of the he i @xmath955876 line in the early - phase spectrum of sn 2005cz and some sne for comparison . the horizontal axis denotes the line velocity normalized by the speed of light .",
    "the blueshift of the absorption component reaches @xmath96 for sn 2005cz .",
    "early - time spectrum of sn 2005cz in comparison with sne ia . from top to bottom , we show the normal sn ia 1994d at @xmath97 and @xmath98 days ( ref .",
    "42 ) , the faint sn ia 1999by at @xmath99 and @xmath100 days ( ref . 43 ) , the peculiar sn ia 2005hk at @xmath101 and @xmath102 days ( ref .",
    "9 ) , and the peculiar sn i ? 2008 ha at @xmath103 and @xmath104 days ( ref .",
    "10 ) ; none of them is similar to sn 2005cz on 2005 july 28 ( presumably at @xmath3 days ) .",
    "the relation between progenitor mass and synthesized @xmath1ni mass@xmath105 . the three sne shown by magenta symbols at the upper right of the panel are associated with @xmath106-ray bursts .",
    "these sne and sn 1997ef are called hypernovae , with the definition that the kinetic energy of the explosion exceeds @xmath107 erg .",
    "sn 2005cz locates roughly at the bottom of the sequence from hypernova to normal sne .",

    "<S> we discovered sn 2005cz on 2005 july 17.5 ut in the elliptical galaxy ngc 4589 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of sn 2005cz taken on july 28 is well consistent with post - maximum spectra of type ib supernovae ( sne ib)@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , sn 2005cz would originate from a core - collapse of an envelope - stripped massive star . </S>",
    "<S> we tentatively assume that the epoch of our first spectrum is at @xmath3 days , where @xmath4 is time after the maximum brightness ( fig . 1 ; see si  1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the late - time spectrum of sn 2005cz at @xmath5 days is very unique ; unlike most of other sne ibc / iib sn 2005cz shows much stronger [ ca ii ] @xmath67291 , 7323 than [ o i ] @xmath66300 , 6364 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ; see ref . 12 , 13 for other sne with large ca / o and si  3 for comparative discussion . ) . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen is ejected mostly from the oxygen layer formed during the hydrostatic burning phase ; its mass depends sensitively on the progenitor mass and is smaller for lower - mass progenitors . on the other hand , ca is explosively synthesized during the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical models predict that the stars having main - sequence masses of @xmath7 and @xmath8 produce @xmath9 and @xmath10 of o , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 of ca , respectively ( e.g. , ref . </S>",
    "<S> 14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the ca / o ratio in the sn ejecta is sensitive to the progenitor mass@xmath13 . to produce the extremely large ca / o ratio </S>",
    "<S> , the mass of the progenitor star of sn 2005cz should be smaller than of any other sne ib reported to date . for both sne 1993j and 1994i that show weaker [ ca ii ] than [ o i ] ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , the progenitor s masses are estimated to be @xmath14 ( ref . </S>",
    "<S> 17,18 ) , which are the smallest among well - studied samples with [ ca ii]@xmath15[o i ] ( e.g. , ref . 16,19,20 </S>",
    "<S> ; see also supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . thus </S>",
    "<S> , the progenitor mass of sn 2005cz is likely @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> sn 2005cz is intrinsically fainter than the well - studied sn ic 1994i by @xmath17 mag ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . in the pseudo bolometric light curve , </S>",
    "<S> the decline rate from the intermediate to the late phase is consistent with @xmath18 , and the luminosity requires that @xmath19 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , @xmath20 is suggested from the line velocity ( fig </S>",
    "<S> . 4 legend ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus estimate @xmath21 and @xmath22 , indicating a small progenitor mass ( @xmath23 ; ref . </S>",
    "<S> 27 , 2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> to explain the above peculiarities , we suggest a star with @xmath24 as the most likely origin of sn 2005cz . </S>",
    "<S> if such a star had been single , its mass ( and thus its mass loss rate ) would have been too small to lose most of its h - rich envelope . </S>",
    "<S> thus this star must have been in a close binary system . </S>",
    "<S> then it became a he star of @xmath25 after undergoing roche lobe overflow . </S>",
    "<S> this he star formed a c+o core of @xmath26 , which marginally exceeded the lower mass limit to form a fe core@xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the overlying he layer had @xmath28 . eventually , the he star underwent fe core - collapse to explode as a sn ib , leaving a @xmath26 neutron star behind . </S>",
    "<S> the ejecta had @xmath28 , consistent with the observed constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the ejecta consists mostly of unburned material in the he layer and a small amount of explosively synthesized elements . </S>",
    "<S> the explosive burning products contain some fe , ca , s , and si , but not much oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> also the ejected part of the unburned oxygen - rich layer is extremely small . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario can explain the peculiar nebular spectrum with large [ ca ii]/[o i ] ratio , as well as the low luminosity and its relatively rapid decrease .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative candidate of the progenitor is a star with @xmath29 in a close binary system . </S>",
    "<S> such a star forms an electron - degenerate onemg core and undergo electron - capture - induced collapse@xmath30 . the most likely scenario to realize a sn ib would be the merging of an onemg white dwarf and a he white dwarf . </S>",
    "<S> the delay time between the star formation and the merging could be long enough to explain the origin of both sn 2005cz and recently reported 2005e@xmath31 with this scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> as for the host galaxy problem , the @xmath32 star model is found to be consistent with the properties recently - inferred for the host galaxy of sn 2005cz . </S>",
    "<S> it is still a genuine e2 galaxy@xmath33 , but has a relatively young stellar population with life times of @xmath34 years@xmath35 and sn ib 2005cz is likely the end product of one of these young stars ( see si  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the mass range of 10 - 12 @xmath36 has not been theoretically investigated in much detail so far , but , as sn 2005cz suggests , the sne resulting from these stars may have a very special abundance pattern in the ejecta and play an important role in the chemical evolution of galaxies ( see si  </S>",
