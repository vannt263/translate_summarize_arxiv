    "in the standard hot big - bang cosmological model , elements of atomic number @xmath7 can not form in appreciable quantities until the first stars form . thereafter , the universe becomes progressively enriched with heavy elements ( metals ) as stars release these fusion products in stellar winds or supernova ejecta .",
    "stars only form efficiently in dense gas , almost all of which is bound in galaxies ( or protogalaxies at high @xmath8 ) with deep gravitational wells . despite this ,",
    "the observed intergalactic medium ( igm ) shows substantial metal enrichment at all redshifts and at all densities yet measured , from the lowest - density ly@xmath5 absorbers at @xmath9 with @xmath10 solar metallicity , to the hot gas with 1/3 - 1/2 @xmath11 bound in present - day galaxy clusters .",
    "a significant fraction , perhaps even a majority , of cosmic metal appears to lie in the igm . at very high redshift ( @xmath12 ) population iii stars could enrich the igm to a low level ( e.g. , carr , bond & arnett 1984 ; ostriker & gnedin 1996 ; haiman & loeb 1997 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1997 ; abel et al .",
    "1998 ) , but since most cosmic metals presumably form in stars in galaxies , a fundamental question arises as to how these metals escape their progenitor galaxies and spread throughout the igm .",
    "efforts to understand the enrichment of the igm by galactic stars ( after any pop .",
    "iii epoch ) have focused on three mechanisms whereby metals could be removed from a galaxy . first , metal - enriched gas ( or stars that later explode as type ia supernovae ) might be unbound during a merger or tidal interaction with another galaxy , or by the ram pressure of the igm through which the galaxy moves .",
    "we shall combine these processes under the name of ` dynamical removal ' .",
    "second , the energy input from supernovae may impart sufficient kinetic and thermal energy to galactic gas for it to escape the gravitational well of the galaxy .",
    "we shall denote this process as the ` galactic wind ' mechanism .",
    "third , the radiation pressure on dust grains due to stellar light may exceed the gravitational force of the matter , leading ( if the dust can decouple from the gas ) to an outflow of dust .",
    "we will denote this possibility by ` radiation - pressure ejection ' or ` dust ejection . '",
    "( the ejected dust adds metals to the intergalactic _ gas _ when it is destroyed by thermal sputtering . )",
    "investigation of the metal enrichment of the igm requires not only some understanding of how these mechanisms function in a given galaxy , but also calls for knowledge of the properties , distribution , and evolution of galaxies in a cosmological context .",
    "studies of these matters have generally adopted one of two rather different , yet complementary , approaches : the ` numerical ' and the ` semi - analytic ' methods .    in the numerical approach , an attempt is made to numerically evolve the state of a single sample of the universe from some set of initial conditions , by solving equations of motion encapsulating the most relevant ( gravitational , hydrodynamical , etc . ) physics . among the advantages of this approach",
    "are that it captures the incorporated physics very well , and that it generates a specific realization of a possible cosmological volume . on the other hand ,",
    "the available computing power limits the amount of detailed physics and the dynamic range that can be handled . also , some physical processes must be ` parameterized ' , and the large computational time prohibits the investigation of large regions of parameter space .",
    "the numerical method has been used by gnedin ( 1998 ) to study the enrichment of the igm by winds and dynamics and employed by cen & ostriker ( 1999 ) and gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) to study igm enrichment by dynamics or other ( unspecified ) processes .",
    "cluster enrichment by galactic winds has been studied using simulations by metzler & evrard ( 1994 ; 1997 ) and murakami & babul ( 1999 ) , and the enrichment of the intracluster medium ( icm ) through dynamics has been numerically studied by abadi , moore & bower ( 1999 ) , by balsara , livio & odea ( 1994 ) , and by quilis , moore & bower ( 2000 ) .    in the semi - analytic approach , predictions are made on a statistical basis , by layering together a number of prescriptions that are individually derived either from theory or observation .",
    "this approach allows the investigation of large regions of parameter space , and employs somewhat more complicated physical prescriptions than the numerical method . on the other hand",
    ", the flexibility in the input parameters and physical prescriptions leads to a corresponding range in actual predictions , and it is not always clear which physical processes are accurately captured and which are not ; nor is it clear that the parameters chosen to best fit the observations are unique . the semi - analytic method has been used by a number of investigators to address igm enrichment in greatly varying levels of complexity .",
    "nath & trentham ( 1997 ) , ferrara , pettini & shchekinov ( 2000 ) , and madau , ferrara & rees ( 2000 ) have studied igm enrichment by winds in this way , attempting also to calculate the statistical properties of the metal distribution in the igm .",
    "cluster enrichment by winds has been studied by dekel & silk ( 1986 ) , nath & chiba ( 1995 ) , and david , forman & jones ( 1990 ) , among others .",
    "the dynamical enrichment of clusters has been similarly examined a number of times ( e.g. , gunn & gott 1972 ; renzini et al .",
    "1993 ) . in both cases",
    "the overall degree of enrichment has been assessed , but not the distribution of the metals .",
    "finally , ejection of dust by radiation pressure has been calculated for individual sample galaxies ( chiao & wickramasinghe 1972 ; ferrara et al .",
    "1990 ; shustov & vibe 1995 ; davies et al . 1998 ; simonsen & hannestad 1999 ) , but only rough estimates of the overall ensuing igm enrichment are offered .",
    "the method used in the present work combines aspects of both approaches .",
    "the time - dependent distribution of dark matter , gas and stars is taken from already completed cosmological smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations computed using the method described by katz , weinberg & hernquist ( 1996 ) . to the gas and star particles , metals are added using fairly simple prescriptions formulated to capture the basic physics of the various processes that can transport metals from galaxies into the igm .",
    "this method yields a numerical realization of the actual distribution of metals in the igm ( as well as in galaxies ) , yet uses relatively little computing time so that a large number of models can be tested , and the effects of changing both physical prescriptions and parameters can be explored .",
    "this method has a number of limitations that will be discussed in detail in the following sections , but it can nevertheless yield important insight into metal ejection and distribution unobtainable by either ` purely ' numerical computations ( using present technology ) , or semi - analytical methods .",
    "this paper presents an explication and investigation of the method we have developed .",
    "we do not attempt to ` fit ' a set of observations using our results , but rather make specific assumptions about our input parameters based on independent considerations , and compare the predictions to observations where available .",
    "we also investigate directly the variations in predictions resulting from different parameter choices , and address various methodological and numerical considerations .",
    "studies addressing specific astrophysical questions using the method presented here will be published separately ( e.g. , aguirre et al .",
    "2001a , b ) .",
    "we have organized this paper as follows .",
    "section  [ sec - method ] describes our calculation method , with subsections  [ sec - locmeth ] ,  [ sec - windmeth ] , and  [ sec - radmeth ] detailing prescription for dynamical , wind , and radiation pressure ejection of metals , respectively .",
    "these sections also describe the parameters used in the calculation and the fiducial values for these parameters ( summarized in tables  [ tab - fidparwind ] , [ tab - fidpardust ] , [ tab - fidpargen ] and  [ tab - fidpargrain ] ) . in   [ sec - obssumm ] we review observations of cluster , galaxy , and ly@xmath5 forest metallicity with which we will compare our results .",
    "section  [ sec - simsvsobs ] briefly compares the sph simulations ( to which we apply our method in this paper ) to observations .",
    "sections  [ sec - resdyn ] ,  [ sec - reswind ] and  [ sec - resrad ] present and discuss the trials we have run and the results obtained .",
    "we summarize our findings and draw general conclusions in    [ sec - conclusions ] .",
    "the procedure begins with a set of coarsely - spaced ( every @xmath13yr ) snapshots from an sph cosmological simulation , each containing the states of the dark matter , star , and gas particles at a given redshift .",
    "we shall index these particles by ` i ' , and superscript them by particle type as ` d ' , ` s ' or ` g ' respectively .",
    "we will also denote by @xmath14 the time of the output being processed , and by @xmath15 the time at the previous output .    beginning with the first output time where stars exist ,",
    "the procedure for each time step is as follows . for a star particle @xmath16 , the stellar mass created since the last step is @xmath17 .",
    "this mass was taken from a gas particle also indexed by @xmath16 , so the first task is to transfer the metals associated with this gas mass from the gas particle to the star particle : @xmath18 \\\\",
    "\\nonumber w^g_i(\\tc)&=&w^g_i(\\tp)-\\delta m^s_i(\\tc)\\times[w^g_i(\\tp)/m^g_i(\\tp)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the metal mass of the @xmath16th particle .",
    "we next assume that each unit of forming stellar mass instantaneously ejects @xmath20 units of metal mass into the gas , so that the star particle @xmath16 adds a metal mass of @xmath21 to the gas particles .",
    "the metals are distributed over the gas particles in a manner appropriate to the particular process , as described in the next few sections .",
    "after all metal is deposited , the process repeats for the next simulation output time .",
    "the first prescription for metal distribution is the simplest .",
    "the metal mass @xmath21 is ` scattered ' over the 32 gas particles nearest to the star particle @xmath16 , weighted by the sph smoothing kernel @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the radius of the sphere ( about particle @xmath16 ) containing exactly 32 gas particles , and @xmath24 is the distance from particle @xmath16 to the gas particle in question ( see hernquist & katz 1989 ) .",
    "since stars form in these simulations only in dense , cool regions with a converging flow , this prescription places metals only in bound regions such as galaxies .",
    "gas particles , some metals will be placed in particles outside the bound group .",
    "] thus with this prescription intergalactic metal must leave galaxies by being carried by a gas particle that is dynamically removed from a bound region .",
    "galactic winds can distribute metals ` non - locally ' , i.e.  disperse them into gas far away from where they are formed . the prescription used to model this physical effect is as follows .",
    "first , we divide the gas and star particles into bound groups ( i.e.  galaxies ) using the skid algorithm . at each simulation step , each bound group is considered in turn . as described above , the new metal mass @xmath21 in each star particle @xmath16 within the group",
    "is computed .",
    "a fraction @xmath25 of this metal is distributed among the 32 gas particles nearest to star particle @xmath16 as per prescription 1 .",
    "the remaining fraction is added to the tally for the new metal in the group , @xmath26 : @xmath27 we then distribute the metal mass @xmath28 within a radius @xmath29 about the ` center of star formation ' @xmath30/\\left [ \\sum_{i \\in { \\rm grp } }   \\delta m^s_i\\right ] , \\label{eq - cosf}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the position of star @xmath16 .",
    "this simulates the non - local dispersal of metal into the regions where winds carry and deposit them .",
    "the metal is distributed so that within the angular ranges @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 $ ] , the metal mass within a shell of width @xmath34 at radius @xmath24 is proportional to @xmath35 ; uniform distribution of metals within the angular region thus corresponds to @xmath36 .",
    "choosing values of @xmath29 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 for each galaxy requires some understanding of the physics of galactic winds .",
    "the idea that galaxies might drive outflowing winds has a fairly long history .",
    "galactic - scale winds , in which supernova bubbles can overlap and drive a coherent wind across the galaxy before they can cool , have been theoretically investigated in dwarf ( e.g. , mac low & ferrara 1999 ) , elliptical ( e.g. , david , forman & jones 1990 ; 1991 and references therein ) , and starburst spiral ( e.g. , heckman et al . 2000 , hereafter hlsa ; lehnert & heckman 1996 ) galaxies . in the last case , such winds can be observed in some detail as high velocity bipolar outflows seen in many starburst galaxies such as m82 ( e.g. , lehnert , heckman & weaver 1999 ) .",
    "even if the conditions to drive a coherent galactic - scale wind do not exist , winds capable of ejecting matter into the igm may still develop : a two - phase ism with a hot phase fed by supernova remnants can lead to a stochastic ` steady - state ' in which some fraction of matter has high enough kinetic energy  perhaps aided by cosmic - ray pressure ( e.g. , breitschwerdt et al . 1991 )  to escape the galaxy ( especially near concentrations of supernovae ) .",
    "winds of this sort have been investigated theoretically by efstathiou ( 2000 ) , ferrara & tolstoy ( 2000 ) , breitschwerdt & schmutzler ( 1999 ) , and ferrara , pettini & shchekinov ( 2000 ) .",
    "thus we see that winds may be starburst - driven , driven by ` quiescent ' star formation , or cosmic ray - driven , and that they may be ` global ' or ` local ' .",
    "these distinctions can readily break down , however : in dwarfs or in galaxies with very rapid star - formation , the local / global distinction breaks down , and at high-@xmath8 ( where star formation is vigorous and mergers common ) there is probably no clear line between starbursts and quiescent star formation .    despite their differences , all of the wind types we have described share some common features :    1 .",
    "the energy release in supernovae is the ultimate source of the wind energy .",
    "some critical supernova rate is necessary for a galactic - scale wind to form and blow out of the disk .",
    "2 .   the wind speed may exceed the escape velocity of the progenitor galaxy , but the wind and the swept - up material must stall or become pressure - confined at some radius .",
    "it is physically reasonable for the wind",
    "s energy to be tied to the star formation rate .",
    "the method used in our investigation is based primarily on observations of galactic - scale ` superwinds ' and has been formulated to capture these three key physical features in a simple and general way , so that it can be reasonably applied to galactic winds of all types ( with varying degrees of confidence ) .",
    "first , we assume some critical sfr/(area ) , sfr@xmath39 , below which wind development is suppressed . for thermal winds",
    ", this should physically correspond to a rate above which supernova remnants can overlap before cooling ( david , forman & jones 1990 ; efstathiou 2000 ; heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) .",
    "this assumption is supported by observations indicating that superwinds in spirals develop when the sfr / unit area ( averaged over the disk ) reaches a critical value ( martin 1999 ; heckman 2000 ) .",
    "since the ` areas ' of spiral galaxies are not robustly determined in the simulations , we compute galaxy areas from their masses , using the empirical mass - radius relation .",
    "] of gavazzi , pierini & boselli ( 1996 ) , who find ( area)@xmath40    we allow all galaxies to drive winds , with an initial wind velocity @xmath41 and mass outflow rate @xmath42 . guided by observations of starburst - driven superwinds ( heckman et al .",
    "2000 ; martin 1999 ) indicating mass outflow rates similar to the galaxies sfrs ( for a wide range of sfrs ) , we express @xmath42 in units of the sfr . assuming that one supernova forms per @xmath43 of star formation and releases @xmath44 of energy , the outflow rate @xmath45 ( in @xmath46yr ) can be related to the fraction @xmath47 of the supernova energy that is incorporated into the wind s kinetic energy @xmath48 , by @xmath49 where @xmath41 is the wind velocity .",
    "we use fixed values of sfr@xmath39 and @xmath47 that are based on the data available for superwinds ( see   [ sec - fidparwind ] below ) . for @xmath41 , we assume a uniform distribution of values with mean @xmath50 and width @xmath51 . given @xmath47 and @xmath41 for a given galaxy , we compute @xmath42 using eq .",

    ", we attenuate @xmath41 by a factor @xmath54 and attenuate @xmath47 by a factor @xmath55 .",
    "this lowers both the energy of the wind and the energy of the initial shell by a factor @xmath55 , and therefore suppresses winds in low - sfr galaxies as desired .",
    "we assume that in each direction @xmath56 the wind flows to some maximum radius @xmath29 , then joins the dynamics of the ambient gas .",
    "this radius , within which the galaxy s metals are distributed , is again determined from the physics of winds . when a bubble of supernova - heated gas forms and begins to expand , several things can stop its growth .",
    "first , the ism of the host galaxy will be swept into a shell which , if massive enough , can confine the wind to the galaxy , as happens in an ordinary single supernova explosion .",
    "if the bubble has enough energy , the shell can be blown out of the disk , whereupon it may partially fragment due to the raleigh - taylor instability or because of density inhomogeneities in the ambient medium ; the hot wind can then stream past the shell , entraining it ( and perhaps other portions of the ism ) into a mass - loaded outflow .",
    "the process may then repeat .    for each of @xmath57 directions @xmath56 , we compute the maximum radius to which the wind could expand by following the dynamics of a ` test ' shell of physical radius @xmath24 about @xmath58 , with mass @xmath59 and outward radial velocity @xmath60 .",
    "this shell represents the initial wave of matter swept up by the developing wind , and feels four forces : the wind s ram pressure , gravity , the thermal pressure of the ambient gas , and the ram pressure of any infalling ambient gas under these four forces the shell momentum evolves according to @xmath61 and the mass evolves as @xmath62 here , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the average density , thermal pressure , gravitational potential and outward radial peculiar velocity of the ambient medium at radius @xmath24 , @xmath67 is the wind velocity , and @xmath68 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath8 : @xmath69.\\ ] ] the averages are done over all particles within the angular ranges @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 $ ] and the radial range @xmath70 $ ] .",

    "we choose @xmath57 for each galaxy to be 1/16th of the number of gas+star particles in the galaxy ; tests show that this gives a small enough number of angles for the radial integrations to be accurate ( see also   [ sec - reswind ] ) .",
    "the entrainment parameter @xmath78 is the fraction of ambient material we assume to be swept up by the wind ; a perfectly homogeneous shell expanding into a homogeneous medium would give @xmath79 , whereas @xmath80 might describe a very clumpy ambient medium with a very small filling factor that the wind can easily stream past ( while filling in the ` holes ' after passing ) , or a shell that repeatedly fragments , leaving behind a fraction @xmath81 of its mass .",
    "( note that we have not included @xmath82 in the terms accounting for the wind on the shell , as would be appropriate if the shell itself had a small filling factor . )",

    "the physical radial velocity of the shell with respect to the ambient gas is @xmath85 , so evolving @xmath86 and @xmath87 until @xmath88 ( @xmath89 gives the radius @xmath90 and time @xmath91 at which the shell stalls and mixes with the ambient gas ( i.e.  moves a distance @xmath92 in another hubble time ; we choose @xmath93 ) .",
    "we set initial conditions for @xmath87 , @xmath94 and @xmath24 by choosing a radius @xmath84 to include a fixed fraction @xmath95 of the galaxy s mass @xmath96 .",
    "the initial shell mass is then @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "( the fraction @xmath95 is calibrated to give values of @xmath84 similar to the radii at which winds from starburst galaxies are observed ; see ",
    "[ sec - fidparwind ] below ) .",
    "the stalling radius must be modified by two effects resulting from our general method , in which we deposit metal generated between times @xmath15 and @xmath14 in the igm at time @xmath14 rather than at the more appropriate average time @xmath99 .",
    "first , if @xmath99 exceeds the time @xmath100 at which the results for metal enrichment are desired , we would allow metals to move to erroneously large radii ; thus we limit the shell to have @xmath101 .",
    "second , if @xmath102 , then metal deposited at @xmath14 will effectively be artificially carried by the movement of the gas particles between @xmath14 and @xmath103 .",
    "for example , if the shell stalls in a region with radial velocity @xmath104 and its metal were deposited at @xmath14 , then at the appropriate distribution time @xmath103 the metal would be in particles at radius ( roughly ) @xmath105 $ ] , rather than at @xmath90 . to compensate for this ,",
    "after the shell reaches @xmath90 we continue to integrate in radius , but using @xmath106 for a time @xmath107 ( or @xmath108",
    "if this is smaller ) , to reach a final radius @xmath109 then @xmath110 will be such that metal deposited at @xmath110 will end up at @xmath90 after being carried by the gas particle movement for time @xmath107 .",
    "this assumes that the radial peculiar velocity field in the galaxy s neighborhood changes on a timescale somewhat longer than @xmath107 .",
    "a similar ( small ) error of the opposite sign arises if @xmath111 . in this case",
    ", we compensate for this error by integrating @xmath112 after stalling , for the time @xmath113 to obtain @xmath110 .",
    "the metal mass is then distributed within the radius @xmath114 , if @xmath115 . if @xmath116 , the wind has been efficiently confined , and we instead distribute the metal ` locally ' as per prescription 1 .",
    "the outlined prescription is based on empirical data concerning galactic - scale superwinds driven by starburst nuclei . for other types of winds ( cosmic ray driven winds , ` quiescent ' winds , ` local ' winds , etc . )",
    "there is far less useful observational data ; most of our understanding of such winds derives from theoretical work ( e.g. , breitschwerdt et al . 1991 ; efstathiou 2000 , ferrara & tolstoy 2000 ; breitschwerdt & schmutzler 1999 , and ferrara , pettini & shchekinov 2000 ) . rather than invent a new prescription for these winds ( based on the theoretical work ) , we have chosen to model them with the same prescription as for starburst - driven superwinds , but with different parameters .",
    "we shall lump these other types of winds into the category of ` quiescent winds ' , which will be characterized by a lower critical sfr ( so that essentially all galaxies drive winds ) , but also a lower @xmath47 since the winds would not be as efficient .",
    "the general wind prescription captures the essential physics of winds well , and and should provide a good prediction of the dispersal of metals by winds with a given assumed set of physical parameters . since we do not model the winds in full physical detail , however , a number of methodological details merit attention .",
    "1 .   adding metals after the completion of the simulation precludes any self - consistent treatment of the effects of the winds on the gas near the galaxy .",
    "this means that we can not assess the importance of earlier outflows in the escape of later outflows and motivates our approach of assuming a ` steady state ' wind running into an undisturbed igm .",
    "also , we do not treat the interaction of winds from a given galaxy with those from nearby galaxies .",
    "thus galaxies can ( unrealistically ) pollute wind - driving neighbors , but only at a small level .",
    "the method also glosses over the detailed structure of the outflowing wind ; we have lumped the details of the wind s interactions with the ambient medium into the parameter @xmath78 , assumed not to vary with radius or among different galaxies .",
    "we neglect the effect of the matter within the test shell radius on the wind that drives the shell .",
    "this is correct for @xmath79 ( since then there _ is _ no matter within the shell ) and for @xmath117 ( since then the wind passes through the matter ) . for intermediate values ,",
    "the wind will have a somewhat lower mass @xmath118 and higher velocity @xmath119 than the mass and velocity @xmath120 that it should have had .",
    "fortunately these effects largely cancel out since ( in the limit where gravity is unimportant ) , @xmath121 by momentum conservation .",
    "we assume a purely kinetic wind impinging upon the shell at all stages .",
    "this leads to the neglect of the pressure inside the shell in equation  [ eq - shellev ] .",
    "it also allows us to disregard shocks and cooling , since the internal energy of the shell does not affect its propagation .",
    "we retain the external pressure term so that environments of very high pressure ( i.e.  clusters ) are not treated incorrectly .",
    "although we compute the maximum wind radius with good accuracy , the deposition profile within this radius , @xmath122 , must simply be assumed .",
    "( but we will demonstrate that the details of the assumed form are not too important ) .",
    "our method assumes that the properties of galaxies driving winds changes on a timescale that is long compared to the outflow time . in particular , we assume that the sfr is constant while the wind propagates .",
    "we check this assumption in   [ sec - reswind ] .",
    "the sfrs we use are averaged over the interval between simulation output times ( typically @xmath123yr ) .",
    "weinberg et al . ( 2000 ) find that such averages are a good approximation to the computed ` instantaneous ' sfrs .",
    "however , the simulations can not resolve the small ( few hundred pc ) scale of starburst nuclei , so real starbursts may be shorter and more intense than the smoothly - varying sfr the simulations would suggest , and lead to a larger scatter in the sfr / area than occurs in the simulated galaxies ( see dav et al .",
    "this is not a problem for more ` quiescent ' winds but complicates the use and choice of a critical wind - driving sfr if winds are assumed to be primarily starburst - driven .",
    "our method concentrates all star formation at a point , from which the wind emanates .",
    "this maximizes the effect of the wind and is appropriate in modeling starbursts , but overestimates the wind effectiveness if star formation is distributed over the galaxy . on the other hand ,",
    "we assume that the wind energy is distributed isotropically .",
    "realistically , winds in their early thermally - dominated phase will be funneled into a bi - conical outflow ( e.g. , mac low & ferrara 1999 ) observations show bi - conical outflows with solid angles of @xmath124 radians at small ( few kpc ) radii ( hlsa ; lehnert & heckman 1996 ) .",
    "thus realistic winds would have a higher energy per unit solid angle and a more effective outflow in those directions .",
    "if @xmath125 is small compared to the size of the galaxy but @xmath115 , the given prescription will artificially concentrate metals in the radius @xmath125 about @xmath58 .",

    "charged grains can be confined to galaxies by magnetic fields .",
    "dust might escape if magnetic fields have a component perpendicular to the galaxy ; winds or parker instabilities exacerbated by the radiation pressure may enhance such a component ( chiao & wickramasinghe 1972 ; ferrara et al .",
    "1991 ; shustov & vibe 1995 ) .",
    "ferrara et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and davies et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have also noted that grains are charged only sporadically .",
    "magnetic fields may also be much weaker at high redshifts if they have been amplified by a dynamo .",
    "determining the effects of magnetic fields would require information about the magnetic structure of galaxies , their halos , and the igm that is presently unavailable , so we will _ assume _ in this study that dust escapes magnetic confinement ( though we emphasize that it also possible that it does not ) .",
    "2 .   after its deposition ,",
    "dust is coupled to gas ( i.e.  follows the gas particles ) .",
    "thus dust distributed in the halo can simply fall back into the galaxy , rather than maintaining its distance from the galaxy .",
    "more detailed calculations show that grains often attain a high velocity at small radii , carrying them past @xmath168 and perhaps to ` infinity ' .",
    "thus our estimates of the radius to which grains could escape is probably an underestimate , because the grains would inevitably reach that radius with some outward velocity that would carry them past it .",
    "however , if the gas drag is high ( or if magnetic fields are important ) , the time to escape the galactic disk could exceed the dust destruction time in that environment .",
    "thus only in certain situations would the dust escape the inner galactic region and ` levitate ' in the halo as the prescription describes .",
    "see aguirre et al .",
    "( 2001b ) for some discussion .",
    "4 .   as in the wind case ,",
    "the method is only fully consistent if the dust ejection time ( i.e.  the transport time from the disk into its final equilibrium position ) is shorter than the interval between simulation outputs or between the ejection time and the time at which results are desired , and shorter than the timescale over which the galaxy properties change .",
    "the errors at late times are unlikely to be important ( see    [ sec - windmeth ] ,  [ sec - reswind ] ) unless the transport time substantially exceeds the time between ejection and ` observation ' .",
    "dust moving with the high velocities ( up to @xmath217 ) found by shustov & vibe ( 1995 ) would not encounter this problem but slower - moving dust might .",
    "the distribution of metals occurs without regard to the existence of nearby galaxies whose luminosity and gravitation would affect the force balance . also , as in the wind prescription galaxies can ( unrealistically ) enrich each other with their metallic outflows , though this is a small effect with the distribution method we employ .",
    "we ignore the radiation - related forces on grains due to photodesorption and the photoelectric effect ( see weingartner & draine 2000 )",
    ". both of these effects would increase the radial force on the grain by a small factor .",
    "also , we neglect the luminosity due to accretion onto black holes .",
    "galaxies are not spherical , so the spatial distribution of ` levitating ' grains will only be approximately spherical if @xmath168 is much larger than the characteristic size of the galaxy",
    "the dust correction we apply is rather uncertain .",
    "we have chosen a dust correction to the uv - optical - nir luminosity based on metallicity , and also tried a luminosity - dependent correction .",
    "the metallicity correction is reasonable and in accord with observations , but it neglects the _ distribution _ of dust within galaxies , the gas fraction , and also the effective temperature of the radiation . at higher redshift , galaxies are probably more compact , have higher gas fractions , and emit more light at short wavelengths where dust attenuation is more effective .",
    "all of these effects may increase the importance of dust at high @xmath8 more than the decrease in metallicity suppresses extinction .",

    "because the intracluster gas mass in a typical rich cluster exceeds the stellar mass in cluster galaxies by a factor of @xmath292 ( e.g. , renzini 1997 ) , this implies that cluster galaxies have probably ejected a large fraction ( possibly up to three quarters ) of their metals . of their metals .",
    "] it also seems that a super - solar yield is necessary to account for all of the metals , since dividing the total cluster metal mass by the total stellar mass in the cluster gives a yield of @xmath293 ( renzini 1997 ; see also aguirre 1999 ) .",
    "it should be noted that measured cluster metallicities are emission - weighted and favor the cluster cores ; strong radial metallicity gradients would imply a different mean metallicity for the cluster .",
    "cluster abundance gradients are currently somewhat inconclusive ( see renzini 2000 ) , but seem to be weak except in clusters with strong cooling flows ( white 2000 ; finoguenov , david & ponman 1999 ) .    while there is general agreement that in the cores of clusters at @xmath294 the gas typically has roughly constant @xmath295 for cluster temperatures down to @xmath296kev ( e.g. , renzini 1999 ) , the observed enrichment of cooler clusters and groups is less secure .",
    "davis , mulchaey & mushotzky ( 1999 ) find that @xmath297 for intra - group gas persists down to temperatures @xmath298kev , but for cooler groups the metallicity  and perhaps also the baryon fraction  declines , perhaps implying that winds can remove metals even from groups .",
    "buote ( 2000 ) , however , finds that two temperature models fit the x - ray data better than the one - temperature models used by davis et al . and",
    "others  these fits yield significantly higher abundances in groups ( @xmath299 ) .",
    "well - resolved observations using _ chandra _ should provide much firmer data on the enrichment properties of groups .      a very useful window into the chemical enrichment of the igm is provided by studies of quasar absorption lines .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the ` forest ' of ly@xmath5 lines found in the spectra of @xmath300 quasars is due to absorption by a smoothly fluctuating neutral hydrogen component of the igm ( e.g. cen et al .",

    ", in preparation ) . at lower masses , galaxies are unresolved by this simulation : as shown by weinberg et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , only galaxies with @xmath336 sph particles are well resolved ; this corresponds to baryonic masses of @xmath337 in the @xmath320 simulations and @xmath338 in the @xmath327 runs . at higher masses",
    "the simulation exhibits a significant excess of galaxies .",
    "this may result from inaccuracies in the mass - to - light conversion for very massive galaxies , or from incompleteness of the surveys ( e.g. , due to surface brightness effects ; see impey & bothun 1997 ) , or due to differences in the way masses of real and simulated galaxies are estimated , or due to overproduction of massive galaxies in the simulations .",
    "the last two uncertainties are exacerbated by the special environments of the largest galaxies , most of which are found in cluster cores .",
    "when integrated , the simulation mass function for the @xmath320 runs yields a cosmic density in stars of @xmath339 .",

    "( 1998 ) from observed luminosity functions , or from the integrated sfr of steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which yields @xmath341 .",
    "likewise , the simulation sfrs both at low and high redshift tend to exceed the observed values ( see weinberg et al .",
    "a similar discrepancy was noted based on earlier simulations by katz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and by pearce et al .",
    "these discrepancies may be caused by an observational underestimate of @xmath342 and of the sfr ( due , for example , to surface brightness effects or high production of low - mass , dim stars ) , and/or by simulation galaxies being too massive by some roughly constant factor , and/or by the overproduction of certain galaxies in the simulations . as compared to the luminosity function computed by steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . ]    in summary , all of the simulations fail to resolve the fraction of the mass function below the simulation resolution limit . at the same time , the simulations may nevertheless",
    "_ over_predict the number and/or mass of galaxies that are resolved .",
    "we will address these issues in detail in future papers ( katz et al .",
    ", in preparation ; bullock et al . , in preparation ; see weinberg et al .",
    "1999 for preliminary discussion ) , but note for the present that the large sfr and possible overabundance of galaxies we find could result from the single - phase description of the gas in the simulations , or from the lack the of strong feedback .",
    "feedback could suppress star formation both in the wind - driving galaxy and in nearby galaxies ( see scannepieco & broadhurst 2000 for some discussion of the latter effect ) , but there is no good way to model such feedback using our current methodology .",
    "if enrichment were caused mainly by dust ejection , dynamics or metal - rich , quiescent winds , our neglect of the winds effect on the galaxies would be more self - consistent , though effects other than strong feedback would then be required to suppress any excess of small galaxies .",
    "any real disagreements between the simulations and reality will clearly affect the accuracy of the igm enrichment calculations of this study .",
    "we test a possible way of compensating for such disagreements by including a parameter @xmath250 that can multiply the sfr ( which effectively sets the supernova rate in our method ) , the yield @xmath20 , and the luminosity of the groups . with @xmath343",
    ", this would be an accurate adjustment if the discrepancy were due to hidden low mass stars , since most of the radiation , metal and energy comes from the most massive stars .",
    "if simulation galaxies are simply more massive by a constant factor @xmath344 , the same adjustment would properly account for the different galaxy luminosities , galaxy sfrs , and overall enrichment of the universe .",
    "however , since the galaxies would still have their original unadjusted masses , we would effectively _ over_estimate the effect of gravitation as well as underestimate the sfr per unit mass in the galaxies .",
    "finally , if the ` observed ' values are underestimated ( and the simulations correct ) , no adjustment is necessary ; the galaxies _ that the simulations resolve _ would be like their counterparts in reality . however ,",
    "as noted above it seems likely that the low - mass galaxies ( at least ) are significantly overproduced in the high resolution simulations at @xmath345 .",
    "the removal of metal - enriched gas from galaxies by dynamical processes has been studied in the context of clusters ( e.g. , fukumoto & ikeuchi 1996 ; abadi , moore & bower 1999 ; quilis , moore & bower 2000 ) , and in the cosmological context ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; gnedin 1998 ; cen & ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "gas may be removed during a close interaction between two or more galaxies in which a fraction of the gas attains escape velocity ( see , e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1992 ) .",
    "alternatively , loosely bound gas may be stripped from a galaxy by the ram pressure of the igm through which the galaxy is moving .",
    "removal of metals via mergers or tidal disruption may occur in clusters or in the general igm , whereas ram - pressure stripping is probably only important in massive clusters .",
    "we have applied the method of   [ sec - locmeth ] to our simulations to examine the dynamical removal of metals .",
    "metals are deposited only in bound groups , thus by calculating the igm enrichment at later times we can directly assess the amount of metals that can be removed by dynamics alone .",
    "the results of these trials are shown in table  [ tab - dynmodrun ] and figs .",
    "[ fig - denrich ] and [ fig - zgal ] .",
    "the table gives the overall fraction of metals that are outside of bound groups , the metallicity of the igm at its mean density and at an overdensity @xmath346 , and the mean stellar metallicity in galaxies .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we include both gaseous metals and dust in computing the metallicities ( for dynamical and wind enrichment , this is at very worst a factor of two larger than if dust is not included ; for dust ejection we show dust and gaseous metal fractions independently ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - denrich ] shows the mean metallicity @xmath347 of the igm as a function of @xmath348 , and the mean metallicity of hot ( @xmath349k ) bound cluster / group gas as a function of gas temperature .",
    "since the clusters tend to have radially declining temperature gradients , the plotted cluster temperatures are lower than the core temperatures ; we have also plotted the mean temperature of the icm within 100kpc for the hottest five clusters .",
    "note also that the cluster gas metallicity is slightly overestimated because some hot gas associated with galaxies is included , but an examination of radial metallicity profiles indicates that the effect is small .",
    "the mean metallicity vs. overdensity should be interpreted with care ; for a highly inhomogeneous metal distribution , the mean can be dominated by a few highly enriched particles and should not necessarily be compared to the ` typical ' metallicity found in ly@xmath5 absorbers .",
    "the median particle metallicity gives a better estimate of typical _ particle _ metallicities , but since each observed line would correspond to gas represented by a number of particles , the median metallicity of absorption systems should probably be higher than the median for particles ( for a highly inhomogeneous distribution ) .",
    "thus we expect that the mean and median particle metallicities should lie above and below the metallicity that should be compared to ` typical ' observed metallicities at a given column density ( see aguirre et al .",
    "2001b for more discussion ) .",
    "in this paper we display mainly mean metallicities , which should be considered upper limits .",
    "the results show that dynamical removal is rather inefficient , removing only a few percent of a typical galaxy s metals over its lifetime .",
    "the enrichment , as clearly shown in fig  [ fig - denrich ] ( dot - dashed line ) , is insufficient to account for the metallicity of ly-@xmath5 absorbers at @xmath305 , which have @xmath350 down to at least @xmath351 .",
    "these results are in substantial agreement with simulations of individual galaxy interactions , which tend to show that only a few percent of an interacting galaxy s mass can attain escape energy during an encounter ( barnes 1988 ; barnes & hernquist 1992 ; hernquist 1992 , 1993 ) .",
    "our    results are somewhat in disagreement with those of gnedin ( 1998 ) , who found  using high resolution slh - p@xmath352 m simulations at @xmath353  that dynamical enrichment was more effective than supernova - driven ejection , and also sufficient to enrich the low - density igm . while our results support the general idea that _ some _ metals escape into the @xmath354 igm through dynamics alone , we find that the amount is negligible compared to the other mechanisms we consider",
    ". we can not rule out the possibility that small ( unresolved by our simulations ) , quickly merging galaxies at @xmath12 could enrich the igm more than our calculations suggest ; this would , however , require more _ efficient _ ejection ( or a very super - solar yield at high @xmath8 ) , since if only a few percent of metals are ejected and mixed thoroughly , at least @xmath355 of gas must form stars with solar yield to give a uniform enrichment of @xmath356 .",
    "the metallicity of the gas in rich clusters in the @xmath320 run is an order of magnitude below the observed value of @xmath357 ( see   [ sec - obssumm ] ) , from which we can conclude that dynamical removal of metals from massive galaxies ( @xmath358 ) can not account for the metallicity observed in cluster gas .",
    "since ram - pressure stripping should be most efficient in small galaxies , it is important to note that we can not directly address the importance of pressure - stripping of dwarf galaxies in icm enrichment .",
    "however , if this process is to account for the observed icm enrichment , it must happen at rather high redshift , since the mass contribution of @xmath359 galaxies at present is quite small , i.e.  the enrichment would have to happen at a high enough redshift that the galaxy mass function had a significant fraction of mass in the small galaxies .",
    "note also that we have neglected enrichment from type ia supernovae in intergalactic cluster stars .",
    "we do not expect this to be significant in the field because only a few percent of the simulation stars are intergalactic ( having been moved into the igm dynamically ) , but it may be more important in clusters , which may have more ig stars .",
    "this effect would be best treated by introducing ` delayed enrichment ' into our simulations .",
    "although inefficient ( for the galaxies resolved ) , dynamical removal is more effective in clusters than in the field . assuming that the ratio of cluster stars to cluster gas is comparable to the field value of @xmath360 , the ejection fraction @xmath361 in rich clusters is @xmath362 in the ` d144 ' model , as compared to 0.04 for all galaxies .",
    "( though if stars form more efficiently in clusters , this fraction would be smaller . )    panels 1 and 4 of figure  [ fig - zgal ] give the average metallicity of stars and gas , respectively , as a function of galaxy mass .",
    "interestingly , stellar and gaseous m - z relations exist even though galaxies retain nearly all of their metals .",
    "the relations occur both because the smallest galaxies have higher gas fractions , and because they tend to be younger .",
    "these can be compared to the plotted lines that are rough fits to the mass - metallicity relations found by zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for ellipticals and spirals spanning @xmath363 b magnitudes .",
    "unfortunately the simulations only have enough dynamic range to probe the brightest four magnitudes .",
    "one should also be cautious about the properties of the smallest galaxies , near the resolution limit ( vertical line ) .",
    "nevertheless , the ` d144 ' model does seem to exhibit an m - z relation that is too weak in stars , and the stars have significantly higher metallicity than observations indicate . more effective feedback would prevent stars from forming in high - metallicity regions but can not cure the problem , since the metals would then be present in the gas  but the gaseous m - z relation is quite close to the observations .",
    "thus it seems that the observed m - z relation very likely indicates metal ejection beyond pure dynamics .",
    "we can also see from these figures that although all the results are shown for a solar yield , the results can not be scaled by changing @xmath20 by a significant amount without clearly violating the observed abundances .",
    "thus while it might be argued that dynamical removal of metals could pollute the igm more than we predict given a much higher yield ( presumably due to an imf biased toward massive stars ) , this argument would require the higher yield to apply only at high-@xmath8 , before the bulk of cosmic metals are formed .",
    "galaxy ms 1512-cb58 no evidence for a non - standard imf . ]    our results concerning dynamical removal of metals are not weakened by the large uncertainties in the assumed parameters , since in this prescription only the yield @xmath20 is important , and can be constrained within a factor of two .",
    "however , our predictions also are subject to some numerical uncertainties .",
    "first , if the timescales for some dynamical processes that remove metals from galaxies were shorter than the time interval between the simulation outputs used , our prescription might not accurately treat their importance .",
    "we have checked this by repeating our calculation using 27 timesteps ( model ` d144mt ' ) rather than 19 ( model ` d144 ' ) ; the additional steps were chosen to roughly halve the interval between snapshots during the epoch when most star formation takes place ( @xmath364 ) .",
    "the differences between these two models are quite small ( see figure  [ fig - denrich ] ) , indicating that even with 19 timesteps our calculations have numerically converged .    a numerical uncertainty that is harder to address is that caused by the limited resolution of the simulations themselves . an accurate assessment of the dynamical removal of metallic gas  whether during mergers , through tidal disruption , or via ram pressure stripping  depends on the ability of the simulations to accurately treat both the igm and the structure of the galaxies .",
    "the mean physical inter - particle spacing in our simulations is @xmath365kpc for the @xmath327 runs and @xmath366kpc for the @xmath320 runs ( where @xmath348 is the gas overdensity ) , large compared to the scale of a typical galaxy .",
    "moreover , the central 200 kpc of a cluster with @xmath367 has only 200 - 2000 sph particles ; it is therefore doubtful that ram pressure effects on cluster galaxies are treated accurately ( see abadi , moore & bower 1999 for discussion ) .",
    "unfortunately we can not yet perform resolution tests as we have only one simulation complete to @xmath3 .",
    "our simulations treat galaxy - galaxy interactions more accurately but still with limitations .",
    "large , thick galaxies are probably represented well , whereas low mass galaxies and thin disks will not be captured .",
    "therefore , while _ in principle _ our type of investigation can assess the efficiency of dynamical removal quite well , in practice we expect limitations due to limited resolution .",
    "we have attempted to test this effect by comparing the efficiency of dynamical metal removal in the @xmath368 and @xmath327 runs with the restriction that metals are only added to gas particles in galaxies of a fixed mass range . for example , we may add metals only to galaxies with @xmath369 ( gas+star ) particles in the @xmath368 run and only to galaxies with @xmath370 particles in the @xmath327 run , to compare the relative efficiency of dynamical removal in galaxies with baryonic mass @xmath371 with different resolution . in this case , we find that @xmath372 of metals are lost by well - resolved galaxies in the @xmath368 run by @xmath313 , whereas @xmath373 are lost in the @xmath327 run .",
    "curiously , we find that as we increase the mass cut for galaxies that receive metals , the ejection fraction _ increases _ in the @xmath327 run , but _ decreases _ in the @xmath368 run .",
    "the difference between the two runs can be accounted for either by a resolution effect ( i.e.  galaxies of the same mass lose different amounts of metals depending on the number of particles constituting them ) , or by the difference in the mass function of galaxies ( i.e.  the presence or absence of galaxies small compared to those with the metals ) .",
    "were we to _ assume _ that in both runs most metals are lost from interactions between galaxies of comparable mass , then it would necessarily be a resolution effect .",
    "but if it were purely a resolution effect , it is very difficult to see why the ejection fraction would decrease with the number of particles in the @xmath368 run while increasing in the @xmath327 run .",
    "thus we suspect that metal - loss from the massive galaxies is dominated by interactions with lower - mass galaxies in the @xmath327 run , but dominated by interactions with other well - resolved galaxies in the @xmath368 run ( the small galaxies being absent ) .",
    "this dependence on the presence or absence of small galaxies makes our resolution test inconclusive .",

    "most galaxies resolved by the @xmath320 simulation can not drive winds past a few tens of kpc ( smaller than the galaxies themselves ) , though a small fraction can drive metals hundreds or thousands of kpc into the igm , where they eventually stall after flowing for up to a few gyr ( see panel 2 ) .",
    "we have plotted all angles for each galaxy , so the vertical ` stripes ' demonstrate the range of radii to which the shells propagate in different directions    ( typically 2 - 32 angles are used for each galaxy ) .",
    "panel 3 histograms the final state of the shells ejected between @xmath388 and @xmath389 .",

    "finally , a small fraction are still propagating at @xmath3 .",
    "as shown in the last panel , most galaxies at @xmath389 in the fiducial model are assumed to be driving winds ( i.e.  their sfr exceeds the assumed critical sfr ) , but even galaxies with very high areal sfrs may not drive an _ effective _ outflow , if they are very massive .",
    "figure  [ fig - intsampz1.5 ] shows the details of the radial integration for one angle of one galaxy at @xmath389 .",
    "the first panel gives the shell , wind , infall and hubble velocities and the igm sound speed versus the shell radius .",
    "the shell , starting at @xmath391 at @xmath392kpc , is quickly decelerated by gravity and by the sweeping up of matter , leaves the @xmath393kpc galaxy at @xmath394 with about 6 times its initial mass ( see the thin , solid line ) .",
    "outside of the galaxy , the same two factors continue to decelerate the wind ( see panels 2 and 3 ) , though now the wind ram pressure is also important , imparting enough force to keep the shell at roughly constant velocity out to several hundred kpc . in this example , the wind coasts for a long time , eventually stopping after running into a nearby mass concentration at @xmath395kpc after @xmath396gyr .",
    "the winds in the fiducial model enrich the icm little , bringing the cluster metallicity to @xmath397 , not much more than dynamics alone ( see table  [ tab - windmodrun ] and figure [ fig - wenrich ] ) . because the overall metal ejection fraction for winds is about 50% higher than for dynamics alone",
    ", this indicates that the cluster environment is suppressing wind escape .",
    "more massive groups / clusters are enriched to a rather uniform level , whereas cooler groups show a large scatter in their metallicity .",
    "this scatter , which may or may not be supported by observations ( see   [ sec - obssumm ] ) , contrasts with the more uniform enrichment by radiation - pressure ejection ( as discussed in   [ sec - resrad ] below ) and persists even in models in which the metal ejection efficiency is much higher ( as in the ` w144max ' model described below ) .",
    "the first row of table  [ tab - windmodrun128 ] shows @xmath313 results for the fiducial model using the @xmath327 run .",
    "here , galaxies have lost nearly half of their metals , enriching the @xmath398 igm to a mean metallicity of 1% solar , somewhat higher than the high end of the observed metallicity of the ly@xmath5 absorbers of similar or greater density ( see fig .  [ fig - wenrich ] ) . and aguirre et al .",
    "( 2001b ) for discussion . ]",
    "relative to @xmath3 , the greater escape fraction of metals occurs because the galaxy mass spectrum is shifted toward smaller mass galaxies at high redshift ; galactic escape velocities thus become small compared to the fiducial ( ` w ' ) model s typical outflow velocity . as discussed in aguirre",
    "et al . ( 2001b ) , we find that the enrichment of low - density regions is limited primarily by the time available for the shells to propagate into the igm .",
    "the dependence of the metal escape efficiency on galaxy mass leads to a slightly steeper stellar m - z relation than does dynamical removal alone , as is evident in figure  [ fig - zgal ] .",
    "the second and fourth panels show galaxy stellar and gaseous metallicity for the fiducial wind model , and the enhanced m - z relation that wind ejection induces on the galaxies .",
    "we see a similar but stronger effect in the @xmath313 galaxy metallicities of the ` w128 ' run ( not plotted ) , but there the m - z relation is evident mainly in the enhanced metallicity of @xmath399 galaxies where the escape speed approaches the assumed wind velocity .    as in the case of dynamical removal",
    ", we have checked some numerical details of the calculation using a number of additional models .",
    "first , we have verified that using roughly half or twice as many simulation outputs changes all results insignificantly ( i.e.  at a similar level as for the same test in the dynamics - only prescription ; see table  [ tab - dynmodrun ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - denrich ] ) .",
    "we have checked that all the results are similarly insensitive to the time step used in the integration , the radius over which we average when integrating ( as long as it is not large ) , and the details of the stalling criterion for the shell .",
    "the accuracy of the radial integration itself has been checked by propagating shells with all forces except gravity turned off ; comparing the shell velocity ( computed via integration ) to the wind velocity ( computed using energy conservation as per eq .",
    "[ eq - vworf ] ) tests the integration accuracy .",
    "a few more numerical details make small but noticeable differences in our results .",
    "halving or doubling the galaxy mass contained within the initial shell radius changes the results of our fiducial model only slightly ( at worst by a factor of two in mean metallicity at the lowest densities ) .",
    "the difference between @xmath90 and @xmath400 , which adjusts for    unphysical movement of metals , turns out to have little effect ; all results of both the ` w128 ' and the ` w144 ' models are changed by @xmath401 if this adjustment is removed .",
    "a third numerical issue , raised in   [ sec - windmeth ] , is that while we calculate the sfr by dividing the stellar mass formed in a galaxy between time @xmath15 and @xmath14 by @xmath402 , we assume that this sfr applies for the entire shell propagation time , which may exceed @xmath402 . since the sfrs we compute are smooth ( i.e.  do nt depend on short episodes of star - formation ) they should vary on roughly the hubble time .",
    "we have run trials in which the wind is turned off entirely a hubble time after its launch , and find unimportant changes in the results .",
    "this insensitivity would also extend to episodic star formation , as long as the episodes are spaced more frequently than the timescale for the wind to decelerate ( so that it does not stall between episodes ) .",
    "a final numerical detail is the number of angles we use , @xmath57 . as described in ",
    "[ sec - windmeth ] , we choose @xmath57 to ensure @xmath403 gas particles per angle in the galaxy so that the spacing between successive particles in radius is smaller than the scale over which the physical properties of the shell change .",
    "this typically results in 2 - 32 angles per galaxy . using the @xmath320 and @xmath327 simulations , we have run trials using 16 , 32 , 64 and 128 particles per angle .",
    "the results are changed very little , indicating that enrichment is quite similar whether we use @xmath404 or @xmath405 angles per galaxy .",
    "this insensitivity is probably due to the fairly spheroidal shape of galaxies and their halos in the simulations , and to the fact that winds tend to be either confined , or escape to large radii where the distribution radius is limited primarily by the time constraint .",
    "thus it seems that our results are not significantly affected by lack of angular resolution .",
    "having examined the fiducial model , we now turn to a set of models in which the simulation parameters have been varied . in analyzing these variations",
    "we may divide their effects on metal distribution into three aspects .",
    "first , the yield @xmath20 , when combined with the simulation s star - formation efficiency , determines the _ total _ metal content in the simulation volume and the rough normalization of the @xmath406 relation .",
    "second , @xmath50 , sfr@xmath39 , @xmath78 , @xmath47 and @xmath37 determine the fraction of metals that escape into the igm ; @xmath407 controls this directly , whereas the other three control whether outflows occur , whether they are strong enough to escape the galaxies and whether the metals get far enough away from the galaxy so that they do not fall back .",
    "these parameters , therefore , directly affect the ratios @xmath408 and @xmath409 , as well as affecting the m - z relation and the level of enrichment of the igm .",
    "third , @xmath50 , @xmath410 and @xmath78 affect how _ far _ metals travel from their progenitor galaxies ; this is most strongly reflected in @xmath411 or @xmath412 , and in the slope of the curves in figs .",
    "[ fig - wenrich ] and [ fig - wmods ] .",
    "the effects of changing @xmath20 are clear ; the output metallicities of the igm and galaxies are all proportional to this parameter .",
    "comparison of the m - z relation of well - resolved simulation galaxies to the observed relation ( see figure  [ fig - zgal ] ) indicates @xmath413 is appropriate , and values differing from this by more than a factor of @xmath404 could not account for the metallicity of observed galaxies unless @xmath414 .",
    "the effects of changing the parameters @xmath415 , sfr@xmath39 , @xmath78 and @xmath47 are a bit more complicated and we describe such variations each in turn .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec - windmeth ] , superwinds in nearby starburst galaxies appear to be characterized by outflow velocities of @xmath416 , but it may be that faster or slower wind velocities better capture the real effect of winds .",
    "models ` lv ' and ` hv ' ( see figure  [ fig - wmods ] and tables  [ tab - windmodrun ] and  [ tab - windmodrun128 ] ) assume wind velocities of @xmath417 and @xmath418 , respectively .",
    "the high velocity model exhibits the features one would expect : more metals escape because the outflows are less easily confined to small radii , and metals travel farther from their progenitor galaxies .",
    "also , the m - z relation becomes somewhat stronger ( the mass threshold above which galaxies tend to retain their metals increases ) .",
    "both trends are reversed in the low velocity model .",
    "interestingly , the ` w144lv ' model shows that some metals reach very low - density regions quite well even if the outflow velocities only drive metals to @xmath419kpc . at @xmath313 in the high resolution simulations the results are similar .",
    "igm enrichment is quite high for the ` w128hv ' model , and the enrichment would be far higher if not for the time constraint .",
    "this is not surprising since the model assumes @xmath420 winds flowing from dwarf galaxies ; it is not clear that such winds could be sustained for long without a catastrophic effect on their hosts .",
    "note , however , that the value of sfr@xmath39 is such that the galaxies only drive strong winds early on ; thus galaxies can not eject all of their metals .",
    "the ` w128lv ' model is interesting for it shows that even low velocity winds can enrich the @xmath398 igm to @xmath421 ( assuming that the overestimation of the sfr and @xmath253 by the simulation is not too severe ; see ",
    "[ sec - simsvsobs ] ) .",
    "we have also tested even lower outflow velocities at high @xmath8 ; model ` w128llv ' assumes outflow velocities of @xmath422 .",
    "even this model enriches the igm at @xmath423 to a _",
    "mean _ level of @xmath424 .    as discussed in   [ sec - windmeth ] , galaxies with sfr/(area )",
    "@xmath425 do not seem to drive observable superwinds , whereas starburst galaxies that _ do _ drive such winds can have much higher areal sfrs .",
    "but since we can not formulate a rigorous criterion for which galaxies in our simulations are driving winds , it is useful to check how strongly the enrichment predictions depend on sfr@xmath39 .",
    "models ` w144lcrit ' and ` w144hcrit ' ( not plotted ) reveal that halving or doubling sfr@xmath53 changes the results in a predictable way . for sfr@xmath426 ,",
    "all galaxies at @xmath427 drive outflows , as do a small fraction of @xmath3 galaxies .",
    "the ejection efficiency is significantly increased , as is @xmath428 ; there is a somewhat smaller effect on the igm metallicity . further decreasing the critical sfr would have only a small effect .",
    "these trends are roughly reversed when sfr@xmath39 is doubled , although in this case yet higher values would lead to progressively more suppression of winds .",
    "an important uncertainty in our assumptions is the entrainment fraction @xmath78 , introduced to account for the fact that an expanding wind - driven shell almost certainly fragments and may either leave a large fraction of itself behind or significantly reduce its covering factor , or , even if fragmentation is not severe , may not sweep up all of the ambient medium if the gas is clumped . in principal",
    "this parameter could be deduced from numerical simulations , but current simulations do not follow the shell far enough into the igm or resolve small - scale structure in the gas well enough to do this .",
    "we have tried values of @xmath78 of 1% , 10% and 100% in model ` le ' , the fiducial model , and ` he ' respectively .",
    "these reveal that the entrainment fraction is quite important ( see figure  [ fig - wmods ] and tables  [ tab - windmodrun ] ,  [ tab - windmodrun128 ] ) , especially in the lower - mass galaxies ( the high mass galaxies tend to retain their winds gravitationally ) .",
    "the differences are particularly large in the enrichment of the low - density igm . as in the case of the wind velocity",
    ", this sensitivity is actually useful , as it could be used to constrain the properties of winds given the observed enrichment of the igm ( if winds are assumed to be responsible ) .",
    "another parameter that is somewhat uncertain is the wind efficiency @xmath47 that fixes the constant of proportionality between the wind energy and the sfr .",
    "we have calibrated @xmath47 to reproduce the approximate observed mass outflow rates .",
    "models ` l@xmath47 ' and ` h@xmath47 ' show the effect of changing this efficiency by a factor of two .",
    "the effect is significant , showing that continual driving by the wind is important in the shell s propagation .",
    "the importance of @xmath47 decreases with increasing @xmath78 ( as the shell propagation becomes dominated by conservation of the initial shell momentum ) .",
    "two final parameters that might be varied ( and for which _ a priori _ values are hard to justify ) are @xmath5 ( controlling the steepness of the radial profile of metal distribution ) and @xmath130 ( the sharpness of the energy attenuation below sfr@xmath39 ) .",
    "trials with @xmath429 and 4 have at most @xmath430 differences in the output quantities listed in table  [ tab - windmodrun ] .",
    "different values of @xmath130 give important differences in the results , but entirely predictable ones .",
    "for @xmath431 the results are similar to the ` q ' model described below ( i.e.  they simulate sfr@xmath432 ) .",
    "choosing larger values of @xmath130 has no effect for small sfr@xmath39 , a drastic effect if all of the galaxies have sfr @xmath52 sfr@xmath39 , and an effect similar to raising sfr@xmath39 itself for intermediate values .    in summary",
    ", we find that the fraction of metals that escape galaxies , expressed as @xmath408 or @xmath433 , is fairly sensitive to the assumed outflow velocity and to the entrainment fraction ( varies by a factor of 2 - 3 within our assumed range ) , is slightly less sensitive to the critical sfr/(area ) and wind efficiency ( varies by less than a factor of 2 ) , roughly scales with @xmath37 , and is insensitive to other parameters such as @xmath5 and @xmath130 . very similarly , the enrichment of low - density regions , which requires metals to travel farther from their progenitor galaxies , is also sensitive to @xmath415 and @xmath78 ( @xmath428 varies by a factor of up to @xmath434 ) .",
    "low - density enrichment is somewhat less sensitive to the assumed critical sfr and wind efficiency , again roughly scaling with @xmath37 , and is not sensitive to @xmath5 or @xmath130 .",
    "cosmologically - averaged metal mass is determined by @xmath20 but can be constrained strongly by comparing the calculations to the observed m - z relation and cluster metallicities .    after varying many of the parameters individually , we have also varied combinations of parameters to model various physically distinct possibilities .",
    "first , we have performed trials with @xmath435 ; this is equivalent to dividing sfr@xmath39 , and multiplying @xmath47 and @xmath20 , by the same value . as described in ",
    "[ sec - otherpar ] , @xmath250 is introduced to account for possible differences between the simulated and observed sfr , mass function and @xmath253 of galaxies . setting a low @xmath250",
    "accurately mimics an imf in which most mass goes into low - mass stars and brown dwarfs , and somewhat less reliably adjusts for over - efficient star formation in the simulations .",
    "the ` lsfr ' models show significantly less ejection and a smaller enrichment of the igm .",
    "the smaller ejection fraction is largely due to the effectively larger sfr@xmath39 .",
    "winds reach smaller radii , due to the lower effective value of @xmath47 .",
    "the very low metallicity of the low density igm is a product of the lowered @xmath20 and the lower ejection efficiency .",
    "the former effect is realistic if @xmath436 is significantly overestimated by the simulations .",
    "however , if we do assume a steep imf so that many low - mass objects are present , we see that @xmath437 would be required if galaxies are to have reasonable metallicities , and this would tend to cancel the effect .",
    "as pointed out in  [ sec - windmeth ] , we have formulated our model to simulate powerful winds from galaxies with the highest sfrs .",
    "but even galaxies that are _ not _ undergoing violent star formation may drive winds ( c.f . ",
    "[ sec - windmeth ] ) , though these must have @xmath438 most of the time , or they would disassemble the entire galaxy over time ( the mass outflow rate given by eq .",
    "[ eq - mdotchi ] would always be larger than the sfr ) .",
    "the ` q ' and ` qlv ' models were chosen to represent such winds ; sfr@xmath39 is set low enough so that almost all galaxies drive winds .",
    "the wind efficiency @xmath47 is 1/10th its fiducial value , and @xmath439 . at low - z and from massive galaxies , igm enrichment in model ` w144q ' is almost as effective as in model ` w144 ' , both because the wind stopping radius depends fairly weakly on @xmath47 , and the larger fraction of galaxies driving winds compensates for the less effective ejection . at high-@xmath8",
    "the ` w128q ' model enriched significantly less than the fiducial model ; this occurs because most galaxies at @xmath9 are driving winds even for the fiducial value of sfr@xmath39 .",
    "the ` qlv ' model assumes also that the winds are relatively slow - moving .",
    "the enrichment in this model is very weak at both high and low @xmath8 , thus if ` quiescent ' winds are to enrich the igm significantly , they must have fairly high velocity .    given the assumption that wind speed does not depend on galaxy mass , low mass galaxies ( mostly unresolved by the @xmath320 simulation ) should eject metals most efficiently .",
    "thus we expect our @xmath320 simulations to under - predict the igm enrichment due to winds .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting that neither the fiducial model nor any of its minor variants can account for the metal enrichment of groups / clusters .",
    "because we resolve most of the observed @xmath3 mass function , this indicates that something other than winds provides the bulk of the enrichment , or that the enrichment happens at fairly high redshift ( where the mass function shifts to lower mass galaxies not resolved by the @xmath320 simulation ) , or that winds are described by parameters somewhat different than those we have assumed . to make this point more robust , we have generated a ` maximal ' model , ` w144max ' , which combines a high wind velocity , high wind efficiency , low entrainment fraction and low critical sfr . while galaxies in this model eject @xmath430 of their metals , the enrichment of clusters is still only about 1/10th solar , several times smaller than observed .",
    "moreover , this is achieved at the cost of a mass - metallicity relation significantly steeper than that observed .",
    "in fact , it does not appear possible to fit both the m - z relation and the cluster metallicity for any set of parameters ( i.e.  without modifying the method ) . because of the low resolution of our @xmath3 simulation it is premature to draw strong implications for the enrichment of clusters , but we hope to return to this topic in a future study .    an interesting physical effect we can examine with our calculations is the effect of winds on _ dynamical _ enrichment : if metals are moved into galaxy halos , it seems likely that they will be more easily removed by dynamical processes .",
    "this effect has been seen in detailed simulations by murakami & babul ( 1999 ) of galactic winds in clusters , and discussed in the context of ` general ' igm enrichment by ferrara et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . to investigate this effect we have run wind models in the @xmath327 and @xmath320 simulations with wind velocities of @xmath440 and @xmath418 , respectively . in the first , we generate metals only at @xmath441 , and examine their distribution at @xmath442 . in the second , we generate metals only at @xmath427 , and examine their distribution at @xmath443 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - diff ] , with the @xmath327 runs on the left and the @xmath320 on the right .",
    "the top panels shown median metallicities ; mean metallicities are given in the bottom panels .",
    "the right panels show that at low @xmath8 the effect exists ; some metals deposited at @xmath444 find themselves at @xmath445 at @xmath3 .",
    "but the effect is slight , and is strongest ( particularly as evinced by the median metallicities ) at @xmath446 , suggesting that it may be happening primarily in groups and clusters .",
    "indeed the left panels show that between @xmath441 and @xmath313 metals tend to migrate from low- to high - density regions ( the metals which go ` missing ' from the plots are those absorbed by stars ) .",
    "thus it seems that in the ` general ' igm , dynamics tend to move metals from moderate density regions into galaxies and other higher - density regions , rather than distributing them more widely into low - density regions .      in summary , we find that many physically distinct ` types ' of winds can enrich the igm to comparable levels .",
    "for example , quiescent winds ( weak winds from all galaxies ) can enrich the igm at all densities to a similar level ( within a factor of two ) as winds with very strong outflows from only the galaxies with the very highest sfrs .",
    "the predictions are , however , different enough ( e.g. , in the m - z relation ) that with refined simulations and better observational data our calculations could be used to constrain the physical models of winds themselves .    while the emphasis of this paper is methodology , we can draw some general conclusions regarding wind enrichment of the igm using our calculation .",
    "we repeat that we have _ not _ shown that winds can develop in any particular type of galaxy ( as in e.g. , mac low & ferrara [ 1999 ] or strickland & stevens [ 2000 ] ) .",
    "instead , we assume the wind properties based on observations , amalgamating the physical criteria for a wind into the methodological criterion of a high enough areal sfr . under this assumption",
    ", galaxies can lose a significant fraction of their metals to the igm .",
    "averaged over all galaxies , we find that typically 5 - 50% of metals are expelled into the igm , and that the fraction is highly degenerate in the assumed parameters .",
    "our calculations indicate that galactic winds can enrich even the low - density regions of the igm quite effectively . at @xmath313 , winds escape to large radii , and the ensuing enrichment is sufficient to roughly account for the metallicity seen in low - density ly@xmath5 absorbers ( see aguirre et al .",
    "2001b for more discussion ) .",
    "enrichment of the igm becomes progressively higher , and spreads to progressively lower density regions of the igm , as redshift decreases ; this is in agreement with the findings of cen & ostriker ( 1999 ) . at @xmath3 , we predict that even quite underdense regions of the igm are enriched to a mean metallicity of @xmath447 unless the parameters are pushed to unreasonable values .",
    "the main implication we can draw for the enrichment of cluster gas is that large galaxies can enrich the gas to @xmath448 of its observed metallicity given our fiducial model assumptions about the wind properties .",
    "( some of this enrichment is direct , and some probably occurs because metals are moved into galactic halos where they are more easily removed by dynamical processes . )",
    "this is probably an underestimate of the overall importance of winds to cluster enrichment because we can not address the importance of low - mass galaxies at high redshift , which would eject metals more efficiently . if winds are to account for the metals in clusters , we find that the enrichment must happen at relatively high redshift , or that one of our assumptions regarding winds must be modified",
    ".    our simulations also make predictions about the properties of galaxies .",
    "while our range in galaxy masses is too small for a conclusive comparison , we find that the m - z relation is nevertheless a good way to break the degeneracy between our parameters  especially that between outflow speed and wind efficiency . while there seems to be an m - z relation in observed bright ( @xmath449 ) galaxies , we have difficulty reproducing this relation .",
    "several effects may contribute to this difficulty .",
    "first , our assumptions that all galaxy types have the same outflow velocity may be flawed ; but experimentation reveals that we would have to change this assumption drastically to alter the high - mass m - z relation , partially because the highest mass galaxies tend to be in clusters where the icm suppresses their winds .",
    "second , the brightest galaxies may be too extended for our method to treat well ( i.e.  the winds are stopped inside and by the galaxy itself ) .",
    "third , the ` average ' metallicity determined by observations may include fewer of the outlying , low - metallicity stars than in the simulations .",
    "finally , it may be that something besides wind ejection causes the observed m - z relation in massive galaxies .",
    "the results reported in this section point to a few general conclusions regarding our methodology .",
    "first , like semi - analytic theories of galaxy formation , the method employs a number of parameters that strongly affect the calculation predictions and that can not be ascribed definite values using observational data .",
    "this limits the number of specific general conclusions we can draw .",

    "we can , therefore , give plausible estimates of the radii to which dust grains might be ejected by galaxies of various masses , ages and types , at various redshifts , and track the distribution of metals after they are deposited , even if they only reach the halos of galaxies .    our fiducial dust - ejection model , labeled ` p144 ' and ` p128 ' in table  [ tab - dustmodrun ] and in the figures , assumes graphite grains with @xmath465 ( see eq .",

    "we assume that half of each galaxy s metals are distributed non - locally ( @xmath439 ) , which is an upper limit since only about half of a typical galaxy s metal mass can be in dust .",
    "( also , the connection between the metal outflow rate and the sfr is much less clear for dust ejection than for supernova winds . )",

    "dust ejection is fairly efficient . in the @xmath320 simulation ,",
    "@xmath3 galaxies have lost 16% of their metals , meaning that @xmath466 of the dust that we assume _ can _ escape actually does escape , with the rest being retained either because it falls back into galaxies or because the galaxies have insufficient light / mass ratios to eject it .",
    "the ejected dust enriches the intracluster gas to @xmath467 , and the @xmath3 igm at mean density is enriched to @xmath468 .",
    "these values can be roughly linearly scaled to lower values of @xmath37 .",
    "dust ejection at high @xmath8 pollutes the @xmath398 igm at @xmath313 to @xmath469 .",
    "the values given are for _ all _ metals ( solid and gaseous ) . figure  [ fig - pmods ] also shows the amount of dust converted to gaseous metals by @xmath313 due to thermal sputtering , in a number of models including the fiducial model .",
    "nonthermal sputtering and dust destruction during ejection would also destroy some dust , so the actual level of observable gaseous metals should lie between the ` gaseous metals+dust ' curves and the ` gaseous metals only ' curves .    a few aspects of the results for the fiducial model merit attention .",
    "first , the enrichment of low - mass groups is much more uniform than in the wind or dynamics - only model ( compare figures  [ fig - denrich ] ,  [ fig - wenrich ] and  [ fig - penrich ] ) . for dust ejection , the metallicity of hot gas declines steadily with gas temperature , leveling off for the hottest clusters . for wind ejection  even for runs with @xmath470  there is a large scatter in the metallicity of groups .",
    "it is currently unclear which of these cases has more observational support .",
    "second , as is evident from figure  [ fig - zgal ] , the m - z relation of galaxies is enhanced by dust ejection over the dynamical removal case and is more similar to the observed relation ( the gas metallicities match the observations particularly well ) .",
    "the m - z relation is , however , somewhat different than for winds ; although the general trend is similar , there is more scatter of low - mass galaxies into high metallicities , and a somewhat less abrupt drop at masses @xmath471 ( especially compared to wind models with a high escape fraction ) . as in the wind case ,",
    "the stellar m - z relation for the most massive galaxies is flatter than observed .",
    "we can investigate the enrichment process in more detail by examining the properties of the galaxies driving the dust outflows .",
    "figures  [ fig - pqz2 ] and [ fig - pqz0 ] show the relations between galaxy mass @xmath472 , metallicity @xmath196 , mass - to - light ratios @xmath333 and @xmath473 , and maximum radius of dust ejection @xmath168 .",
    "interestingly , at @xmath474 , fairly large galaxies drive dust to the largest radii , whereas at @xmath475 , dust ejection is most efficient in the smallest and the largest galaxies ( see panel 4 of both figures ) .",
    "this occurs because large galaxies have a relatively larger ratio of stars to gas and dark matter . at lower redshifts ,",
    "this effect is overwhelmed in the smallest galaxies by the dust correction ( which increases @xmath166 more in large galaxies ; see panels 2 and 5 ) , and by the tendency of smaller galaxies to be younger .    at high",
    "@xmath8 , graphite dust can be driven to @xmath476mpc by at least some galaxies , whereas at low @xmath8 galaxies can drive dust only to a few hundred kpc .",
    "the @xmath3 galaxies have typical bolometric ( dust corrected ) @xmath166 values    of @xmath477 and _ uncorrected _ @xmath333 ratios of @xmath147 .",
    "panel 6 of figure  [ fig - pqz0 ] shows the b - band luminosity function of the @xmath3 simulation galaxies computed using the simple spectral synthesis described in  [ sec - radmeth ] , and compares it to the 2df observed luminosity function ( dashed line ) . the simulated luminosity function with no dust correction ( light solid line ) is a poor fit to the observations .",
    "the dark solid line shows the same data with the metallicity - dependent dust correction ( given in eq .",
    "[ eq - zcorr2 ] ) used in calculating dust ejection . applying this correction",
    "requires a choice of @xmath206 , where @xmath478 ( in this context ) is the ratio of b - band extinction to uv ( 1900@xmath479 ) extinction .",
    "the curve shown assumes @xmath480 ; with such a choice the simulations can roughly fit the observed luminosity function .",
    "the actual relation between uv and blue extinction depends not only on the dust absorption curve but also on the amount and distribution of dust in the galaxy ( see , e.g. , charlot & fall 2000 ) and is uncertain ; but @xmath480 is not an unreasonable value , indicating that the dust correction and spectral synthesis methods can probably produce satisfactory ( good to within a factor of a few ) luminosities for our simulation galaxies .",
    "we now investigate the effects of variations in the model parameters . as in the wind models",
    ", @xmath20 determines the total simulation metal mass .",
    "the amount of metals driven from galaxies depends directly on @xmath37 , less directly on @xmath481 , the @xmath166 ratio from stellar synthesis , and the dust correction , and quite weakly on the form of @xmath482 ; the last four quantities also determine how far the dust travels . in turn , @xmath218 depends primarily on the dust type , @xmath166 values depend on the imf , and the dust correction depends on the fir / optical ratio of the extragalactic background light .",
    "the absorption efficiency of dust grains depends mostly on their composition ; in this study we have used opacities for both graphite grains and less efficiently absorbing silicate grains .",
    "model ` sil ' assumes the latter .",
    "since the maximal @xmath218 is 1/5 that of graphite , ejection is significantly less efficient ( see table  [ tab - dustmodrun ] and figure  [ fig - pmods ] ) .",
    "this is important because the majority of dust mass is locked in silicates in most carbon / silicate grain models ( e.g. , weingartner & draine 1999 ; duley , jones & williams 1989 ; mathis & whiffen 1989 ) .",
    "thus a model in between the fiducial model and the ` sil ' model is a more accurate representation of a realistic dust distribution for a two - component model .",
    "we next tried a model with an assumed salpeter imf , with @xmath483 .",
    "this resulted in somewhat brighter galaxies at @xmath484 , and somewhat dimmer galaxies at @xmath485 ; the overall effect is to slightly enhance dust ejection .",
    "the effect on the m - z relation is also weak .",
    "the simulation results are also somewhat sensitive to the choice of the low - mass cutoff in the imf , as this changes the stellar mass with little effect on the luminosity . for example , starting the salpeter imf at @xmath486 rather than @xmath487 would lower @xmath166 by @xmath488 and the low - mass imf advocated by gould , flynn & bahcall ( 1996 ) would decrease it even more .",
    "these uncertainties are , however , unlikely to change @xmath166 by more than a factor of two and are hence contained within the range of variations we try .",
    "the assumed dust correction is more important than the chosen imf , and comparable in importance to the choice of grain properties . maintaining the dust correction based on metallicity",
    ", we have varied @xmath206 to reproduce a present - day ratio of @xmath489 in the @xmath3 extragalactic background ( where @xmath490 includes uv and nir light also ) .",
    "the extremes of this range are shown in models ` wcorr ' and ` scorr ' in table  [ tab - dustmodrun ] .",
    "although @xmath168 is generally several times higher in the ` wcorr ' model than in ` scorr ' , the enrichment of the low - density igm is quite similar .",
    "this indicates that very low - density igm regions can be spatially close to high - density metal - forming regions .",
    "we also modeled a constant dust correction with @xmath491 , in model ` ccorr ' , and a luminosity - dependent dust correction ( model ` lcorr ' ) .",
    "the results are only slightly different from the fiducial case . as in the other prescriptions ,",
    "the dust ejection calculations are insensitive to the number of time steps employed .",
    "ejection of dust by radiation pressure requires that the dust decouple from the gas . even in the brightest galaxies ,",
    "radiation pressure can not overcome the gravitational force on both dust and an associated gas mass more than @xmath492 times as large .",
    "we have verified this in our simulations using a trial with @xmath493 , and no dust correction .",
    "the results are nearly identical to the dynamical removal run , indicating that radiation pressure is in this case ineffective even at moving dust into the halos of galaxies .      the fiducial dust ejection model can account for both the low - density igm metallicity at @xmath313 and a significant fraction of cluster metals .",
    "it also fits the stellar m - z relation reasonably well at intermediate masses , but not at high masses ( where none of our models predict high enough metallicity ) .",
    "dust can be ejected from galaxies by radiation pressure if three basic conditions hold .",
    "first , the luminosity / mass ratio toward the galaxy must be large enough that radiation pressure exceeds the gravitational force .",
    "second , the gas drag on dust must be small enough that dust can pass through the dense gaseous part of the galaxy and into the halo / igm before being destroyed .",
    "third , the dust must not be confined by magnetic fields that are bound to the gas . in this study , we have addressed only the first condition , distributing the dust at the radius where gravitational and radiation pressure forces balance .",
    "we have _ not _ addressed whether dust can truly decouple from the gas or , if so , what dust outflow rate ensues .",
    "the trials presented in this section indicate that with reasonable assumptions about the grain properties , spectral synthesis and dust correction and with neglect of extra light from quasars and extra force on grains from the photoelectric effect ",
    "each of which gives approximately a factor of two uncertainty in the radiation pressure force  a significant fraction of the dust can be expelled from the simulated galaxies .",
    "this conclusion would change only if several of the uncertainties conspired to make the force an order of magnitude or more smaller than we have estimated .",
    "the main weakness of our method is a poor understanding of dust ejection itself , and in particular how well magnetic fields can confine grains to galaxies . assuming that grains can escape ,",
    "our method can provide strong predictions of the spatial distribution , grain - size distribution and destruction of dust , as well as the extinction and reddening due to ig dust .",
    "these predictions will be presented in detail in a future study .",

    "we have applied the method to several cosmological simulations . using these results",
    "we can draw some conclusions both about the methodology we have developed , and about metal ejection in the real universe .",
    "in our simulations , removal of metals by purely dynamical processes such as ram - pressure stripping or tidal disruption of galaxies , is relatively ineffective at polluting the igm . averaged over their mass function , galaxies of mass @xmath6 ( i.e.  those resolved by our @xmath320 particle simulation ) lose @xmath497 of their metals by @xmath3 .",
    "this accounts for only about @xmath498th of the metal density observed in the gas of rich clusters , though we can not address the dynamical enrichment of clusters by smaller galaxies that could have comprised a significant fraction of the mass function at high @xmath8 .",
    "dynamical removal alone also can not account for the mass - metallicity relation observed in present - day galaxies of all masses .",
    "galaxies of mass @xmath499 also lose @xmath500 of their metals by @xmath313 , enriching ly@xmath5 absorbers with @xmath501 to @xmath502 , about @xmath492 times less than observed .",
    "these results indicate that _ if _ dynamical removal were to account for metals in the low - density ly@xmath5 absorbers ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; gnedin 1998 ) , it must have been by smaller galaxies , presumably at very high redshifts ( @xmath503 ) .",
    "we also find that the dynamical removal of metals is enhanced if the metals are moved into galaxy halos ( i.e. , by winds or dust - ejection ) , but only slightly and only at low @xmath8 ; at high @xmath8 the net effect of dynamics is to move metals from low- to high - density regions .",
    "if the metals in the igm came from fairly massive galaxies at @xmath504 , some mechanism other than dynamical removal must have played an important role .",
    "supernova - driven winds are a plausible candidate .",
    "our prescription assumes that winds develop at a critical sfr / area , with a fixed velocity , and an energy in the wind proportional to the sfr .",
    "we find that the degree of igm enrichment is not very sensitive to the wind efficiency ( unless it is very different than we have assumed ) or how the metals are distributed within the wind ` stopping radius ' .",
    "the results _ are _ sensitive to the assumed fraction of the ambient material entrained by the wind , the wind outflow velocity , and the critical sfr . if the latter is chosen so that a significant fraction of high-@xmath8 galaxies drive winds ( as indicated by observations of lyman - break galaxies ; see steidel et al .",
    "2000 and pettini et al . 2001 ) , then winds with outflow velocities of @xmath505 or more ( as also indicated by the observations ) can escape to large distances , and enrich the low - density igm to roughly the level observed at @xmath140 . whether the enrichment can match the observed metallicities in detail , and whether the wind process itself would disturb the low - density igm more than allowed by observations is an important and open question ( see theuns , mo & schaye [ 2001 ] for some discussion of the latter ) .    at lower redshifts ,",
    "winds even from massive galaxies may be important , though in our models metal ejection from galaxies of @xmath506 probably can not account for all of the metals in cluster gas unless a rather extreme model is adopted or one of our methodological assumptions is changed . since smaller galaxies eject metals more efficiently , it is possible that winds could account for the icm metallicity if these were included .",
    "wind ejection also leads to a mass - metallicity relation comparable to  but somewhat steeper than  that observed .",
    "using future simulations with a larger range of galaxy masses , the m - z relation should be a useful diagnostic of outflows , as it helps break the degeneracy between our model parameters in determining the metal ejection efficiency .",
    "the ejection of dust by radiation pressure is another interesting way that metals may escape galaxies .",
    "we assume that a significant fraction of galactic dust escapes to the radius where gravitational and radiation - pressure forces balance .",
    "we find that our basic results are not strongly sensitive to the assumed imf or dust correction .",
    "the results do , however , depend on the grain type and on the very important assumption that the grains are not confined by the gas or magnetic fields in galaxies .",
    "the results show that metals removed from @xmath507 galaxies as dust , then destroyed in the igm or galaxy halos by sputtering , could also account for the mean level of igm enrichment observed at @xmath313  although again it is unclear whether the distribution agrees with the observations in detail . at low redshift",
    ", massive galaxies can enrich the icm to the observed levels .",
    "moreover , since dust ejection does not ` avoid ' high - pressure regions as winds do , dust can enrich intragroup gas more uniformly than winds .",
    "enrichment of the igm by dust would provide a number of chemical signatures ; in particular , non - depleted elements such at n and zn should be underrepresented in the igm ( see aguirre et al .",
    "2001b ) .",
    "most generally , our simulations support the view that a significant fraction of cosmic metals lie in the igm , and our method provides a useful way to generate predictions of the cosmic distribution of metals usable in a number of ways . with higher - resolution simulations we should be able to more effectively test the importance of low mass galaxies at all redshifts , as well as perform more careful resolution tests of our results .",

    "<S> this study develops a method of investigating the chemical enrichment of the igm and of galaxies , using already completed cosmological simulations . to these simulations , we add dust and ( gaseous ) metals assuming instantaneous recycling , and distributing the dust and metals in the gas according to three simple parameterized prescriptions , one for each enrichment mechanism . these prescriptions are formulated to capture the basic ejection physics , and calibrated when possible with empirical data . </S>",
    "<S> our method allows exploration of a large number of models , yet for each model yields a specific ( not statistical ) realization of the cosmic metal distribution that can be compared in detail to observations . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that dynamical removal of metals from @xmath4 galaxies can not account for the observed metallicity of low - column density ly@xmath5 absorbers , and that dynamical removal from @xmath6 galaxies can not account for the icm metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical removal also fails to produce a strong enough mass - metallicity relation in galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , either wind or radiation - pressure ejection of metals from relatively large galaxies can plausibly account for all three sets of observations ( though it is unclear whether metals can be distributed uniformly enough in the low - density regions without overly disturbing the igm , and whether clusters can be enriched quite as much as observed ) . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate in detail how our results change with variations in our assumed parameters , and how results for the different ejection processes compare . </S>"
