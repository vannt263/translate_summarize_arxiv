    "the key point is that the non - uniqueness in the correspondence between abelian length functions and @xmath26-trees alluded to above nevertheless leads , via harmonic maps , to a well - defined geometric object on @xmath1 , in this case a quadratic differential .",
    "the most important result here is theorem [ t : abelian ] . along the way",

    "we denote by @xmath13 the set of gauge equivalence classes of these solutions .",
    "then @xmath13 is a complex analytic variety of dimension @xmath101 ( the holomorphic structure depending upon the choice @xmath9 on @xmath1 ) , which admits a holomorphic map ( cf .",

    "implicit in the definition of @xmath39 is a @xmath3-equivariant harmonic map @xmath106 from the universal cover @xmath107 of @xmath1 to @xmath69 .",
    "it is easily verified that the _ hopf differential _ of @xmath106 , @xmath108 , descends to a holomorphic quadratic differential @xmath30 on @xmath1 equal to @xmath109 ( up to a universal non - zero constant ) .",
    "having introduced harmonic maps , we now give an alternative way to view the morgan - shalen compactification .",
    "first , it follows by an easy application of the bochner - weitzenbck formula that a sequence of representations @xmath110 diverges to the boundary only if the energies @xmath111 of the associated equivariant harmonic maps @xmath112 are unbounded .",
    "furthermore , given such a sequence it was shown in @xcite that if the @xmath110 converge to a boundary point in the sense of morgan - shalen , then the harmonic maps @xmath112 converge ( perhaps after passing to a subsequence ) in the sense of korevaar - schoen to a @xmath3-equivariant harmonic map @xmath113 , where @xmath71 is a minimal @xmath3-tree having the same projective length function as the morgan - shalen limit of the @xmath110 . as pointed out before , the tree is not necessarily uniquely defined , and even in the case where the tree is unique , uniqueness of the harmonic map is problematic .",
    "recall that a harmonic map to a tree means , by definition , an energy minimizer for the energy functional defined in @xcite .",
    "given such a map , its hopf differential @xmath114 can be defined almost everywhere , and by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1.1 ) , which can be adapted to the singular case , one can show that the harmonicity of @xmath106 implies that @xmath114 is a holomorphic quadratic differential .",
    "the equivariance of @xmath106 implies that @xmath114 is the lift of a differential on @xmath1 .",
    "note also that if @xmath115 is harmonic , then @xmath116 if and only if @xmath106 is constant . in the equivariant case ,",
    "this in turn is equivalent to @xmath117 ( cf.@xcite ) . for the rest of the paper",
    ", we shall tacitly assume @xmath85 .",
    "a particular example is the following : consider a non - zero holomorphic quadratic differential @xmath30 , and denote by @xmath114 its lift to @xmath107 .",
    "let @xmath118 denote the vertical leaf space of the ( singular ) foliation of @xmath114 , and let @xmath119 denote the natural projection . according to @xcite ( and using the correspondence between measured foliations and geodesic laminations ) ,",
    "@xmath118 is an @xmath26-tree with an action of @xmath3 , and the projection @xmath120 is a @xmath3-equivariant continuous map .",
    "we note two important facts : ( 1 ) the vertices of @xmath118 are precisely the image by @xmath120 of the zeros of @xmath114 ; and ( 2 ) since the action of @xmath3 on @xmath118 is small , @xmath118 has no fixed ends ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "[ p : projection ] the map @xmath119 is harmonic with hopf differential @xmath114 .",
    "since @xmath118 has no fixed ends the existence of a harmonic map follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that @xmath120 is itself an energy minimizer seems to be well - known ( cf .  the introduction to @xcite , and @xcite ) : although the definition of harmonic map in the latter reference is  priori different from the notion of an energy minimizer , a proof follows easily , for example , from the result in @xcite .",
    "indeed , consider a sequence of @xmath3-equivariant harmonic diffeomorphisms @xmath121 with hopf differentials",
    "@xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "let @xmath124 denote the pull - back distance functions on @xmath107 by the @xmath125 , and let @xmath126 denote the pseudo - metric obtained by pulling back the metric on @xmath118 by the projection @xmath120 .",
    "extend all of these to pseudo - metrics , also denoted @xmath127 and @xmath126 , on the space @xmath128 constructed in @xcite .",
    "then the natural projection @xmath129 coincides with the map @xmath120 . on the other hand , by (",
    "* section 4.2 ) , @xmath130 pointwise , locally uniformly .",
    "therefore , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.9 ) , @xmath120 is an energy minimizer .",
    "next , we consider @xmath3-trees which are not necessarily of the form @xmath118 .",
    "we need the following :    [ d : morphism ] a _ morphism _ of @xmath26-trees is a map @xmath131 such that every non - degenerate segment @xmath73 $ ] has a non - degenerate subsegment @xmath132 $ ] such that @xmath133 restricted to @xmath134}$ ] is a isometry onto its image .",

    "it is a fact that a morphism @xmath131 is an isometric embedding unless it folds at some point ( cf .",

    "consider @xmath141 .",
    "we first show that @xmath133 is well - defined : indeed , assume @xmath142 .",
    "then @xmath143 and @xmath144 may be connected by a vertical leaf @xmath145 of the foliation of @xmath114 .",
    "now by the argument in @xcite , @xmath106 must collapse @xmath145 to a point , so @xmath146 . in order to show that @xmath133 is a morphism , consider a segment @xmath147\\in t_{\\tilde\\varphi}$ ] .",
    "we may lift @xmath75 to a point @xmath148 away from the zeros of @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , we may choose a small horizontal arc @xmath149 from @xmath148 to some @xmath150 projecting to @xmath73\\subset[x , z]$ ] , still bounded away from the zeros .",
    "the analysis in @xcite again shows that this must map by @xmath106 isometrically onto a segment in @xmath79 .    *",
    "* it is easily shown ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that images of equivariant harmonic maps to trees are always minimal subtrees ; hence , throughout this paper we shall assume , without loss of generality , that our trees are minimal . thus , for example , the factorization @xmath140 above either folds at some point or is an equivariant isometry .",
    "the basic fact is that the hopf differential for a harmonic map to a given tree is uniquely determined :    [ p : hopf ] let @xmath79 be a minimal @xmath26-tree with a non - trivial @xmath3 action . if @xmath151 are equivariant harmonic maps @xmath152 , then @xmath153 .",
    "this is proven in @xcite , where in fact the full pull - back  metric tensor \" is considered .",
    "in our situation , the result can also be seen as a direct consequence of the leaf structure of the hopf differential .",
    "first , by @xcite the function @xmath154 is subharmonic ; hence by the equivariance it must be equal to a constant @xmath155 .",
    "we assume @xmath156 , since otherwise there is nothing to prove .",
    "set @xmath157 , @xmath158 .",
    "suppose that @xmath159 is a zero of @xmath114 , and let @xmath160 be a small neighborhood of @xmath161 containing no other zeros of @xmath114 , and no zeros of @xmath162 , except perhaps @xmath161 itself .",
    "then by proposition [ p : factorization ] it follows that @xmath106 is constant equal to @xmath163 on every arc @xmath164 of the vertical foliation of @xmath114 with endpoint @xmath161 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath165 is a connected set satisfying @xmath166 for all @xmath167 .",
    "since spheres are discrete in trees , @xmath168 is constant equal to @xmath169 on @xmath145 as well . referring again to proposition [ p : factorization ]",
    ", this implies that @xmath145 must be contained in a vertical leaf of @xmath162 . in this way",
    ", one sees that the zeros of @xmath114 and @xmath162 coincide with multiplicity in @xmath107 .",
    "thus , the same is true for @xmath30 and @xmath170 on @xmath1 .",
    "since the quadratic differentials are both normalized , they must be equal .",
    "we shall also need the following restriction on the kinds of foldings that arise from harmonic maps :    [ l : noadjacentedges ] let @xmath171 arise from a harmonic map as in proposition [ p : factorization ] .",
    "then folding occurs only at vertices , i.e.  the images of zeros of @xmath114 , and at the zeros of @xmath114 , adjacent edges may not be folded . in particular , folding can not occur at simple zeros .",

    "we can find distinct segments @xmath173 of the horizontal foliation of @xmath114 with a common endpoint @xmath161 which map to segments of @xmath118 .",
