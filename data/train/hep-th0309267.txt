    "zamolodchikov @xcite was recently completed by ponsot and teschner  @xcite and by teschner @xcite .    on the other hand there",
    "exists so called geometric approach originally proposed by polyakov @xcite and further developed by takhtajan @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the operator formulation of the dozz theory the correlators of primary fields with elliptic and parabolic weights are expressed in terms of a path integral over conformal class of riemannian metrics with prescribed singularities at the punctures . some of the predictions derived from this representation can be rigorously proved and lead to deep geometrical results @xcite .    in spite of these achievements",
    "the relation between both approaches is not fully understood  @xcite .",
    "this in particular concerns the problem of path integral representation of the liouville correlators with hyperbolic weights which in order requires an appropriate choice of the liouville action functional . a step in this direction was done in our previous paper @xcite where we constructed the classical liouville action satisfying the polyakov conjecture in the case of hyperbolic singularities .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the classical liouville action for three hyperbolic singularities and show that the result agrees with the classical limit of the corresponding dozz three point function . in the case of three singularities",
    "the monodromy problem considerably simplifies and the solution can be find in terms of hypergeometric functions @xcite .",
    "it shares all the properties required by the construction of the liouville action and the proof of the polyakov conjecture given in @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sect.2",
    "we briefly describe the @xmath0 monodromy problem for @xmath1 hyperbolic singularities on the riemann sphere .",
    "the singularity structure of the corresponding solutions to the liouville equation is analyzed .",
    "in sect.3 we present the essential steps of the construction of the classical liouville action and calculate its partial derivatives with respect to the conformal weights .",
    "in sect.4 we derive the solution to the monodromy problem in the case of three hyperbolic singularities .",
    "the corresponding solution to the liouville equation defines a singular hyperbolic geometry on the sphere .",
    "we illustrate the structure of the closed geodesics and the singular lines of this geometry on two examples .",
    "in sect.5 we find an explicit expression for the classical liouville action and compare it with the classical limit of the dozz three point function invariant with respect to the reflections @xmath2 .",
    "the classical liouville action proposed in @xcite can be easily generalized to the case of an arbitrary number of elliptic , parabolic and hyperbolic singularities on the riemann sphere .",
    "the results of the present paper provide additional justification for this construction .",
    "the path integral representation of correlation functions based on this action functional may provide a new insight into the geometric content of the quantum liouville theory and is certainly worth further investigations . also the classical theory itself rises some interesting questions concerning the existence and the uniqueness of regular solutions to the @xmath0 monodromy problem .",
    "let us finally mention that the classical solutions with hyperbolic singularities are of interest in 3-dim gravity where they describe multi - black - hole configurations @xcite .",
