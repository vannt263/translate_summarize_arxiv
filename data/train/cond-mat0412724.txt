    "<S> by lda+u method with spin - orbit coupling ( lda+u+so ) the magnetic state and electronic structure have been investigated for plutonium in @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases and for pu compounds : pun , pucoga@xmath2 , purh@xmath3 , pusi@xmath3 , pute , and pusb . for metallic plutonium in both phases in agreement with experiment a nonmagnetic ground state was found with pu ions in @xmath4 configuration with zero values of spin , orbital , and total moments . </S>",
    "<S> this result is determined by a strong spin - orbit coupling in 5@xmath5 shell that gives in lda calculation a pronounced splitting of 5@xmath5 states on @xmath6 and @xmath7 subbands . </S>",
    "<S> a fermi level is in a pseudogap between them , so that @xmath6 subshell is already nearly completely filled with six electrons before coulomb correlation effects were taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the competition between spin - orbit coupling and exchange ( hund ) interaction ( favoring magnetic ground state ) in 5@xmath5 shell is so delicately balanced , that a small increase ( less than 15% ) of exchange interaction parameter value from @xmath8 = 0.48  ev obtained in constrain lda calculation would result in a magnetic ground state with nonzero spin and orbital moment values . for pu compounds investigated in the present work , predominantly @xmath4 configuration with nonzero magnetic moments </S>",
    "<S> was found in pucoga@xmath2 , pusi@xmath3 , and pute , while pun , purh@xmath3 , and pusb have @xmath9 configuration with sizeable magnetic moment values . </S>",
    "<S> whereas pure @xmath10 coupling scheme was found to be valid for metallic plutonium , intermediate coupling scheme is needed to describe 5@xmath5 shell in pu compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our calculations show that exchange interaction term in the hamiltonian must be treated in a general matrix form for pu and its compounds . </S>"
