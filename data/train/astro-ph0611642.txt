    "in recent years vlbi observations have provided many accurate values of the apparent luminosity , @xmath1 , of compact radio jets , and the apparent transverse speed , @xmath0 , of features ( components ) moving along the jets .",
    "these quantities are of considerable interest , but the intrinsic physical parameters , the lorentz factor , @xmath2 , and the intrinsic luminosity , @xmath3 , are more fundamental . in this paper",
    "we first consider the `` inversion problem ; '' i.e. , the estimation of intrinsic quantities from observed quantities .",
    "we then apply the results to data from a large multi ",
    "epoch survey we have carried out with the vlba at 15  ghz .    the inversion problem is discussed in  [ s : beams][s : inversion ] with an idealized relativistic beam , one that has the same vector velocity everywhere , and contains a component moving with the beam velocity .",
    "the jet emission is doppler boosted , and monte  carlo simulations are used to estimate the probabilities associated with selecting a source : that of selecting ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) from a given ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) ; and the converse , the probability of ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) being the intrinsic parameters for an observed ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) .    in  [",
    "s : inversion ] we introduce the concept of an `` aspect '' curve , defined as the track of a source on the ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) plane ( the observation plane ) as @xmath16 ( angle to the line - of - sight , los ) is varied ; and an `` origin '' curve , defined as the set of values on the ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) plane ( the intrinsic plane ) from which the observed source can be expressed .",
    "these provide a ready way to understand the inversion problem , and illustrate the lack of a unique inversion for a particular source .",
    "probabilistic limits provide constraints on the intrinsic parameters for an individual source ; but when the entire sample of sources is considered , more general comments can be made , as in  [ s : distros ] .",
    "the observational data are discussed in  [ s : data ] .",
    "they are from a 2cm vlba survey , and have been published in a series of papers : ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and e.  ros et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation .",
    "this is a continuing survey and the speeds are regularly updated using new data ; in this paper we include results up to 2006 september 15 .",
    "the analysis also includes some results from the mojave program , which is an extension of the 2cm survey using a statistically complete sample @xcite .",
    "prior to , the largest compilation of internal motions was in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) , who tabulated the internal proper motion , @xmath17 , for 66 agn , and @xmath0 for all but the two without a redshift .",
    "the data came from many observers , using various wavelengths and different vlbi arrays , and consequently were inhomogeneous .",
    "the 2cm data used here were obtained with the vlba over the period 19942002 , and comprise `` excellent '' or `` good '' apparent speeds for components in 119 sources .",
    "this is a substantial improvement over earlier data sets , and allows us to make statistical studies which previously have not been possible .",
    "other recent surveys are reported by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) with data on 15  agn at 43  ghz , @xcite with data on 12  agn at 15 and 22  ghz , and @xcite with data on 77  agn at 8  ghz .    in some sources",
    "it is clear that the beam and pattern speeds are different , and to discuss this we differentiate between the lorentz factor of the beam , @xmath18 , and that for the pattern , @xmath19 . in most of this paper , however , we assume @xmath20 and drop the subscripts . in  [ s : lorentz ] and  [ s : distros ] peak values for the distributions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the sample are discussed , and in  [ s : qb ] the low  velocity quasars and bl lacs are discussed .",
    "it is likely that some of these have components whose pattern speed is significantly less than the beam speed .",
    "the radio galaxies in our sample are discussed in  [ s : galaxies ] , and we show that most of them are not high  angle versions of the powerful quasars .",
    "cygnus a may be an exception , and we speculate that it contains a fast central jet ( a spine ) , with a slow outer sheath .    in this paper",
    "we use a cosmology with @xmath21  kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "in this section the standard relations for an ideal relativistic beam ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are reviewed .",
    "the beam is characterized by its lorentz factor , @xmath2 , intrinsic luminosity , @xmath3 , and angle @xmath16 to the line of sight . from these the doppler factor , @xmath24 , the apparent transverse speed , @xmath0 , and the apparent luminosity , @xmath1 ,",
    "can be calculated :    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the speed of the beam in the agn frame ( units of @xmath29 ) and @xmath3 is the luminosity that would be measured by an observer in the frame of the radiating material . the exponent @xmath30 in equation  [ eq : lum ] combines effects due to the k correction and those due to doppler boosting : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the spectral index ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 is the doppler boost exponent , discussed in  [ s : assum ] .    from equations ( [ eq : delta ] ) and ( [ eq : beta_app ] ) , any two of the four parameters @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath24 , and @xmath16 can be used to find the others ; a convenient relation is @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ f : beam_par]a shows @xmath24 and @xmath0 as functions of @xmath36 , all normalized by @xmath2 ; the curves are valid for @xmath37 . when @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the `` critical '' angle @xmath41 is defined by @xmath42 , and the approximation @xmath43 will be used ; this is accurate for @xmath37 and @xmath44 , and is correct to 20% for @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is also useful to regard @xmath0 and @xmath16 as the independent quantities .",
    "figure  [ f : beam_par]b shows @xmath24 and @xmath2 as functions of @xmath36 , all normalized by @xmath0 .",
    "the curves are calculated for @xmath47 and change slowly with @xmath0 , for @xmath48 .",
    "in our analysis we assume that a source contains an ideal relativistic beam ; one that is straight and narrow , and in which the pattern speed is the same as the beam speed : @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , the doppler factor for the core must derive from the same values of @xmath2 and @xmath16 as apply to the value of @xmath0 for the moving component , several pc or more away .",
    "many sources , however , are seen to have more than one moving component , and they may have different values of @xmath0 . in these cases",
    "we have selected the fastest speed , on the grounds that of all the components , it is the one most likely to be moving at near the beam speed .",
    "it probably is due to a shock associated with an outburst in flux density , while some of the slower components might be trailing shocks @xcite .",
    "the main shock itself must be moving faster than the beam , but the synchrotron source , which is a density concentration behind the shock , can have a net speed slower than the shock , as shown by numerical simulations @xcite .    in some sources the only component we see is stationary at a bend in the jet .",
    "we believe that in these cases we see a standing shock , or perhaps enhanced radiation from a section of the jet which is tangent to the los .",
    "these components will have @xmath50 and might be part of the population of slow quasars discussed in  [ s : qb ] .",
    "it is clear that some jets are not straight , and that @xmath16 is not the same in the core and in the moving components .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite where the velocity vector changed during the course of observations , and and , where the image shows a jet with sharp bends .",
    "however , in cases where at least moderate superluminal motion is found , the motion must be close to the los , and any changes in angle will be strongly amplified by projection .",
    "an observed right angle bend could correspond to an intrinsic bend of only a few degrees .",
    "the doppler boost exponent @xmath34 depends on geometry and optical depth and is discussed by @xcite . for a smooth jet , @xmath51 , and this value is appropriate for the core region , where , we assume , the relativistic beam streams through a stationary @xmath52 region . in some cases",
    "the moving component can be modelled as an isolated optically thin source , which would have @xmath53 , but for most of the sources the flux density is dominated by radiation from the core , and we use @xmath51 here .",
    "see figure  5 in .",
    "the other term in the exponent @xmath30 is the spectral index @xmath32 .",
    "nearly all the sources have a  flat \" spectrum , @xmath54 , and they also have variable flux density and a variable spectrum . because of the time dependence it is not possible to generate a useful index for each source , and we take @xmath55 as a rough global average , giving @xmath56 .",
    "this is further justified in  [ s : boost_exp ] , where it is shown that @xmath57 does not fit the data",
    ". however , this choice of @xmath55 clearly leads to error for those sources with a high doppler factor , say @xmath58 , because the k - correction must cover a frequency range of a factor of 30 .",
    "this introduces uncertainty into the estimates of intrinsic luminosity .",
    "we shall use equation  ( [ eq : lum ] ) as if @xmath3 is independent of @xmath16 , but this is not necessarily so .",
    "the opacity in the surrounding material may change with @xmath16 , and the luminosity of any optically thick component may change with angle .",
    "other changes in @xmath3 might be caused by a change in location of the emission region , as @xmath16 , and therefore the doppler factor and the emission frequency , change @xcite .",
    "the probability of selecting a source with a particular value of @xmath16 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 , or @xmath24 from a flux density  limited sample of relativistically  boosted sources is central to our discussion .",
    "because @xmath59 (  [ s : boost_exp ] ) and @xmath24 decreases with increasing @xmath16 , the sources found will preferentially be at small angles , even though there is not much solid angle there . calculated the probability @xmath60 ( the subscript @xmath61 means _ fixed _ ) in a euclidean universe , and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) extended this with monte  carlo calculations , to include evolution .",
    "however , the observations directly give @xmath0 , not @xmath2 , and @xmath62 is generally not an analytic function . to deal with this , m.  lister et al .",
    "( in preparation ) are using monte ",
    "carlo methods to study the probability functions .",
    "we use one of their simulations here , as an illustrative example .    in the monte ",
    "carlo calculation , a simulated parent population is created ( see appendix  [ appendix ] ) , from which one hundred thousand sources with @xmath63jy are drawn .",
    "we select a slice of this sample with @xmath64 and form the histograms in figure  [ f : beam_par]c , showing the probability density @xmath65 and the cumulative probability @xmath66 for those sources with @xmath67 .",
    "the histograms vary slowly with @xmath2 , provided @xmath68 .",
    "they are similar to the equivalent diagrams calculated by ( figure  7 ) and by ( figure  5 ) .",
    "figure  [ f : beam_par]c may be directly compared with figure  [ f : beam_par]a , which is a purely geometric result from equations [ eq : delta ] and [ eq : beta_app ] .",
    "the peak of the probability is at @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the 50% point of @xmath72 is at @xmath73 , giving a median value @xmath74 .",
    "an interesting measure of the cumulative probability is @xmath75 , the fraction of the sample lying inside the critical angle .",
    "the slow variation of this fraction with @xmath2 is seen in figure  [ f : prob]a ; a rough value is 0.75 ; i.e. , most beamed sources will be inside their  @xmath76 cones . \" in this paper we will take @xmath77 as a practical range for the probability . this corresponds , approximately , to @xmath78 for @xmath79 , and the angular range for this probability range varies slowly with @xmath2 . figure  [ f : appendix ] ( appendix  [ appendix ] ) shows the @xmath80 distribution for 14,000 sources from the simulation , along with the 4% and 96% limits .",
    "we have now described @xmath65 , the probability for selecting a jet at angle @xmath16 if it has lorentz factor @xmath81 .",
    "however , given that we observe @xmath0 and not @xmath2 , we must consider also the probability @xmath62 ; i.e. , the probability of finding a jet at the angle @xmath16 if it has a fixed @xmath0 .",
    "we again use a slice of the monte  carlo simulation , now for @xmath82 , to get the probabilities shown in figure  [ f : beam_par]d .",
    "the probability density curve is broad , and as @xmath0 decreases it becomes more peaked .",
    "the median value of @xmath83 is shown with the dashed line in figure  [ f : prob]b , as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the probability @xmath84 is also of interest .",

    "the sharp peak can be understood in geometric terms . in figure",
    "[ f : beam_par]b one sees that there is a large range of @xmath16 over which @xmath2 changes little from its minimum value near @xmath0 , and figure  [ f : beam_par]d shows that most of the probability is in this range . for about half the sources with @xmath85",
    ", @xmath2 is between 15 and 16 , but the other half is distributed to @xmath5 , as shown in figure  [ f : prob_curves]a . for lack of better information , it often is assumed in the literature that @xmath88 , but this is not always valid .",
    "figure  [ f : prob_curves]b shows @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath85 .",
    "the curves change slowly for @xmath48 . unlike the lorentz factor , the probability for the doppler factor does not have a sharp peak .",
    "consequently @xmath3 , which varies as @xmath91 , is poorly constrained by @xmath0 .    in this paper a particular monte ",
    "carlo simulation is used , to show probability curves in figures  [ f : beam_par ] and [ f : prob_curves ] , and , numerically , to find the 4% , 50% and 96% levels of the cumulative probability distributions .",
    "these are fairly robust with regard to evolution and parent luminosity functions .",
    "we have compared them among several of the simulations calculated by m.  lister et al . , and the variations are not enough to materially affect any of the conclusions in this paper .    figures  [ f : beam_par][f : prob_curves ] are not valid in the non  relativistic case , where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "our discussion is also not valid for samples selected on the basis of non  beamed emission .",
    "vlba observations can directly give apparent speed @xmath0 and apparent luminosity @xmath1 , but the lorentz factor @xmath2 and the intrinsic luminosity @xmath3 are more useful .",
    "we refer to the estimation of the latter from the former as the inversion problem .",
    "the inversion is illustrated with figure  [ f : beam_curves ] . on the left is the intrinsic plane , with axes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and on the right is the observation plane , with axes @xmath0 and @xmath1 . consider a source at point @xmath97 in figure  [ f : beam_curves]a , with @xmath98 and @xmath99whz@xmath7 .",

    "the width of the peak is controlled by the exponent @xmath30 in equation  [ eq : lum ] , as discussed in  [ s : boost_exp ] .",

    "we call z an _ origin _ curve .",
    "it is parametric in @xmath16 , with @xmath105 on the left as shown .",
    "the curve has been truncated at @xmath5 , because this is the approximate upper limit of @xmath2 for our data , as shown in  [ s : lorentz ] .    given the lack of a constraint on @xmath16 , the inversion for the observed point @xmath103 in figure  [ f : beam_curves]b is not unique .",
    "any point on the origin curve z in figure  [ f : beam_curves]a could be its counterpart .",

    "jodrell bank 6cm survey @xcite .",
    "although no aspect curve is shown in @xcite , it is clear that the general shape of the distribution is similar at 6 and 2  cm .",
    "the parameters of the aspect curve in figure  [ f : beta_l ] are used in  [ s : distros ] to derive limits to the distributions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the quasars .",
    "a striking feature of figure  [ f : beta_l ] is the lack of sources to the left of the aspect curve ; i.e. , we found no high@xmath0 , low@xmath1 sources .",
    "we recognize two possible selection effects which might influence this , the lower flux density limit to the survey , and the maximum angular velocity we can detect .",
    "we now combine these to derive a limit curve .",
    "the 2cm survey includes sources stronger than 1.5 jy for northern sources , and 2.0 jy for southern sources .",
    "additional sources which did not meet these criteria , but were of special interest , are also included in the full sample . however , here we are using the median vlba flux density values from for the sub  sample of 119 sources for which we have good quality kinematic data , and the median of these values is 1.3 jy .",
    "we choose @xmath125  jy as the lower level of `` detectability , '' although 10% of the sources are below this limit .",
    "the completeness level actually is higher , probably close to 1.5  jy , but the survey sources form a representative sample of the population of sources with @xmath126  jy .",
    "the angular velocity limit , @xmath127 , is set by a number of factors , including the complexity and rate of change of the brightness distribution , the fading rate of the moving components , and the interval between observing sessions .",
    "these vary widely among the sources , and there is no easily quantified value for @xmath127 . in practice , we adjusted the observing intervals for each source according to these factors , with @xmath128 being about one year in most cases .",
    "this was usually sufficient to eliminate any ambiguity in defining the angular velocity as seen on the `` speed plots , ''",
    "the position vs.  time plots shown in figure  1 of .",
    "for some sources there was little or no change in one year , and these were then observed less frequently . for others ,",
    "a one year separation was clearly too long , and they were observed more frequently , typically twice per year for complex sources .",
    "the fastest angular speeds we measured were @xmath129 milliarcsec ( mas ) yr@xmath7 , and we saw no evidence for faster motions that would require more frequent observations .",
    "it is important to note that even programs with shorter sampling intervals , down to every 1 or 2 months , have not detected many speeds over 1 mas yr@xmath7 , and none significantly larger than 2 mas yr@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a rough limit on our ability to identify very fast components is given by our typical one year observing interval and the fading behavior of jet components . from an analysis of six sources",
    ", @xcite found that the flux density of jet components fades with distance from the core as @xmath130 .",
    "if a jet component is first identified at a separation of 0.5 mas with a flux density of 50  mjy , that component will probably have faded from view when it is 4 or 5 mas away , where it will have a flux density of only a few mjy .",
    "such a component , appearing just after a set of observations , could fade from view before the next observation a year later , if it was moving at @xmath131 mas yr@xmath7 . in practice , however , we would be likely to observe such a source in the middle of its cycle , and it would appear to have jet components a few mas from the core which flicker on and off in an unpredictable fashion .",
    "so while we would not have been able to measure the actual speed of such a source , it would have been identified in our sample as unusual , and followed  up with more frequent observations .",
    "given that we identified no such objects , we take 4 mas yr@xmath7 as a reasonable upper limit to the speeds we are sensitive to with our program .",

    "there is some evidence that rapid fading occurs at 43  ghz , and in ",
    "[ s : qb ] we describe a source with a component moving more rapidly at 43  ghz than at 15  ghz .",
    "it is likely that the difference is due to a combination of a fast fading rate and better angular resolution , combined with the shorter observing intervals , at 43  ghz .",
    "even here , however , the observed speed at 43  ghz is well under the limit .",
    "curve k in figure  [ f : beta_l ] , parametric in redshift , is calculated from the limits @xmath132  jy and @xmath133  mas  yr@xmath7 .",
    "the hatched region to the left of the curve is inaccessible to our observations except in special circumstances , such as when the brightness distribution is simple and there is only one feature in the jet .",
    "the horizontal lines in figure  [ f : beta_l ] show the minimum redshift associated with a value of @xmath0 , set by the distance at which @xmath134  mas  yr@xmath7 ; while the vertical lines show the maximum redshift associated with a value of luminosity , set by the distance beyond which the flux density is below 0.5  jy .",
    "thus , every point to the right of curve k has a range of redshift within which it is observable , and that range fixes a spatial volume .",
    "inspection of the diagram shows that the volume goes to zero at the limit curve and increases towards the envelope .",
    "this gradient constitutes the selection effect .",
    "sources are unlikely to be found near the limit curve because the available volume is small .",
    "the volume inreases towards the envelope ; and , for example , at @xmath135  whz@xmath7 , @xmath136 , the range @xmath137 is available . in the sample of 119 sources we use , there are 10 sources in this range , all of them , evidently , far from the region in question . at @xmath138  whz@xmath7 , @xmath139 , the range @xmath140 is available and 6 of the survey sources are in this range ; again , none of them is near the region in question .",
    "hence , the lack of observed sources to the left of the envelope is not a selection effect ; but rather , must be intrinsic to the objects themselves .",
    "the four sources we found with @xmath141masyr@xmath7 are all in the compilation . listed four additional sources with @xmath142masyr@xmath7 : , which has a fast long  wavelength ( 18  cm ) component far from the core , , which is in the southern sky and",

    "we note that , with years of increasingly better observations on more objects , the known number of sources with fast components has not increased .",
    "there are only 5 compact jets that show @xmath143masyr@xmath7 at 15  ghz , within our flux density range .",
    "these are all nearby objects and include three galaxies , , , and ; one bl  lac object , itself ; and one quasar , .",
    "monthly monitoring at higher resolution by detected 5 sources ( out of 15 ) that had @xmath143masyr@xmath7 .",

    "in addition , they measured @xmath145masyr@xmath7 for ( ) , but it has low flux density and is not in our survey .      the exponent @xmath30 in equation  [ eq : lum ] controls the sharpness of the peak of the aspect curve .",
    "figure  [ f : width_n ] shows the data with three aspect curves for @xmath5 , with different values of @xmath30 .",
    "the curves have been truncated at the 4% and 96% probability limits , and the values of @xmath3 have been adjusted so that the curves roughly match the right - hand side of the data .",

    "it is important to compare the curves with the data only in the region where the probability is significant . from figure",
    "[ f : width_n ] there is no strong reason to pick one value of @xmath30 over another . however , if @xmath57 , the boosting becomes so strong that strong distant quasars , near the peak of the distribution , have @xmath3 as small as the jets in weak nearby galaxies , which ( we argue in  [ s : galaxies ] ) are only mildly relativistic .",
    "this is unrealistic , and we conclude that @xmath146 .",
    "the value @xmath56 has a theoretical basis (  [ s : assum ] ) and we have adopted it here .",
    "note the large range in intrinsic luminosity corresponding to different values of @xmath30 . since @xmath30 is not known with precision ,",
    "the intrinsic luminosities have a corresponding uncertainty .",
    "beaming is a powerful relativistic effect that supplies a strong selection mechanism in high  frequency observations of agn . consider a sample of randomly oriented , relativistically boosted sources that have distributions in redshift , intrinsic luminosity , and lorentz factor .",
    "make a flux density  limited survey of this sample . and",
    "have shown that in this case the selected sources will have a maximum value of @xmath0 which closely approaches the upper limit of the @xmath2 distribution , even for rather small sample size .",
    "this comes about because the probability of selecting a source is maximized near @xmath147 where @xmath148 ( see figure  [ f : beam_par]c ) ; and there is a high probability that , in a group of sources , some will be at angles close to @xmath41 , where @xmath149 .",
    "hence , because @xmath150 , the upper limit of the @xmath2distribution is @xmath151 .",
    "we showed in  [ s : selection_effects ] that the lack of sources to the left of the envelope is not a selection effect , but is intrinsic to the objects .",
    "since the envelope is narrow at the top , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are correlated ; high @xmath0 is found only in sources that also have high @xmath1 , but low @xmath0 is found in sources with all values of @xmath1 .",
    "this translates into @xmath2 having a similar correlation with @xmath3 , for the quasars .",
    "the @xmath2 distribution will be similar to the @xmath0 distribution in figure 7 , but flatter ; with many points shifted up , but nearly all by less than a factor 2 above @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath3 distribution will remain more spread out at low @xmath2 than at high @xmath2 , leading to the correlation that the highest @xmath2 are found only in jets with high intrinsic luminosity .",

    "there is little available redshift volume at the peak , but the volume increases rapidly at lower @xmath0 , and the lack of sources there means that source b is unlikely to have @xmath98 .",
    "alternatively , it could be close to an extension of curve @xmath79 , but then it is again in a low  probability region .",
    "there are a number of sources near the peak of curve @xmath79 , and b could be a high  angle version of one of them .",
    "but the probability of that is well below 0.04 , and there can be few such sources in the entire sample of 119 .",
    "we conclude that the galaxies and bl  lacs on the left side of the distribution ( @xmath156whz@xmath7 ) , with high confidence , are not off - axis versions of the powerful quasars ( curves @xmath157 and 32 ) , nor are they high@xmath2 , low@xmath3 sources ( curve @xmath98 ) .",

    "note that use a different procedure to calculate @xmath187 , and do not assume an intrinsic temperature .",
    "the @xmath187 are model  dependent and their reliability is difficult to assess .",
    "the lorentz factors for the quasars are not estimated in this paper , but from figure 3 it can be seen that many of them must have lorentz factors close to their apparent speeds .",
    "thus , from table 1 and figure 8 , the lorentz factors of the superluminal galaxies are comparable with those for the slower quasars .",
    "their luminosities , however , do not overlap with those for the quasars , indicating that they are a different population .    only one of the seven slow galaxies ( @xmath189 ) has @xmath0 consistent with zero ( 2@xmath178 ) .",

    ". however , cygnus a may be an exception , as discussed in the next section .",
    "@xcite have concluded that most radio galaxies ( including fri ) contain relativistic jets .",
    "they assumed that all sources have jets with intrinsic bipolar symmetry , and used the measured side  to  side ratio with a correlation between lobe power and intrinsic core power to obtain limits on @xmath198 and @xmath16 .",
    "our procedure may be more robust because each source has a measured @xmath0 , and we do not appeal to symmetry of the lobes .      the galaxy @xmath199 merits special discussion .",
    "the radio lobes are exceptionally powerful , and their luminosity is comparable to that of the most powerful and distant radio galaxies .",
    "the jets , however , are weak .",
    "optical polarization studies @xcite reveal polarized broad lines and show that is a modest quasar .",
    "@xcite used the front - to - back ratio of the jets of at 6  cm , together with @xmath0 , to estimate @xmath16 .",
    "we repeat their analysis with our value for @xmath200 , and obtain @xmath201 .",

    "these contradictory ideas can be reconciled with a two  component beam , consisting of a fast spine with a slow sheath , as suggested by numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the slow beam that we see has @xmath206  jy .",
    "the fast beam is at a high angle to the los and not seen because it is deboosted , and it must be at least a factor of ten weaker than the slow beam ; i.e. , @xmath207  jy . if the fast beam has a lorentz factor of about 10 , then if observed at a small angle its flux density would be up to a few hundred jy , far higher than observed in any other source .",
    "but is much closer than most superluminal sources ; and if the nearest quasar , 3c 273 , were at the distance of , its flux density would be within a factor 2 of our putative value for .",
    "if were at @xmath208 , and pointed near the los , it would be a normal quasar , with radio and optical luminosity somewhat below the median for quasars .",
    "it is exceptional only because it is accidentally nearby .",
    "this model solves the long  standing problem of the strong lobes combined with the weak core .    in this model the total flux density from varies more slowly with @xmath16 than @xmath91 , the commonly assumed law .",
    "if this is correct , and if it applies generally to many other radio sources , then it will affect the usual discussions of the unification of radio sources by aspect .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , who invoke a two  component model in their article on unification .",
    "the aspect curve in figure  [ f : beta_l ] is a good envelope to the quasar data , and this suggests that the relativistic beam model is realistic .",
    "the slow rise and rapid fall of the curve is a direct consequence of doppler boosting combined with time contraction , both of which are relativistic effects .",
    "we have used the common assumption that the moving vlbi component is traveling with the beam ; i.e. , @xmath209 .",
    "but if this is incorrect , for example , if the beam and pattern speeds are independent , or often are far apart , then it is hard to see why an aspect curve should form an envelope .",
    "in particular , if they are independent , then some sources should have high @xmath12 with low @xmath13 , and this could place them to the left of the envelope in figure  [ f : beta_l ] .",
    "the lack of sources there has been emphasized earlier , and is evidence that , for the fastest components in many sources , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are closely related . ,    in about a fourth of the bl lacs and quasars the fastest component appears to be moving slowly @xmath210 .",
