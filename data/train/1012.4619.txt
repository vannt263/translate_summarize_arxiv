    "interaction between @xmath0 meson and thermal photons may remain undetected inside the kloe-2 detector and constitute the background process where quantum coherence is destroyed .    to estimate the probability of this interaction , we assume in the calculations that photons are in a room temperature and @xmath0 is moving with respect to the laboratory frame with the energy obtained in the @xmath1 decay .",
    "meson @xmath0 is electrically neutral but it has inner electromagnetic structure so it can interact with photons .",
    "we are interested in interactions in which @xmath0 is observed in a final state .",
    "the main process is the inverse compton effect , that is photon scattering on kaon in which photon s energy increases and kaon s decreases .",

    "the cross section @xmath5 for the @xmath6 compton scattering can be obtained from the cross section for the radiative scattering of the kaon in electromagnetic fields of nuclei , known as the primakoff effect , and is given by @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the @xmath0 mass and @xmath15 the fine - structure constant .",

    "taking into account the lorentz transformation of the photon energy from the laboratory frame to the rest frame of @xmath0 : @xmath18 and the lorentz invariance of @xmath19 , one gets the transformation of the density of photons : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the velocity of @xmath0 with respect to the laboratory frame . using consecutively equations ( [ eq : dninw ] ) , ( [ eq : dn ] ) and ( [ eq : kinw ] ) and knowing that @xmath22 , the formula for the interaction frequency ( [ eq : dn / dt ] ) reads ( where @xmath23 ) : @xmath24",

    "obvious sources of systematics are uncertainty of @xmath16 and @xmath17 and variation of temperature .    the first one was estimated using values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , derived using different methods in papers @xcite and @xcite . the result obtained in this paragraph",
