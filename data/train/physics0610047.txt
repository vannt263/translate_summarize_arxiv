    "pricing financial derivatives is a main subject in mathematical finance with clear implications in physics . in 1900 ,",
    "five years before einstein s classic paper , bachelier  @xcite proposed the _",
    "arithmetic _ brownian motion for the dynamical evolution of stock prices with the aim of obtaining a formula for option valuation .",
    "samuelson  @xcite noticed the structural failure of bachelier s market model : it allowed negative values for the stock price , what led to undesired consequences in option prices . for correcting these unwanted features he introduced the _",
    "geometric _ brownian motion . within his log - normal model ,",
    "samuelson obtained the fair price for perpetual options , although he was unable to find a general solution for expiring contracts .",
    "the answer to this question must wait until the publication of the works of black and scholes  @xcite , and merton  @xcite .",
    "the celebrated black - scholes formula has been broadly used by practitioners since then , mainly due to its unambiguous interpretation and mathematical simplicity .",
    "it is well established , however , that this model fails to fit some features of actual derivatives .",
    "in particular , there is solid evidence pointing to the necessity of relaxing the assumption , present in the black - scholes model , that a constant volatility parameter drives the stock price .",
    "many models have been developed with the purpose of avoiding this restrictive condition : in merton  @xcite volatility was a deterministic function of time , in cox and ross  @xcite was stock - dependent , hull and white  @xcite proposed a model where the squared volatility also follows a log - normal diffusion equation , wiggins  @xcite considered underlying and volatility as a two - dimensional system of correlated log - normal random processes , in scott  @xcite , and also in stein and stein  @xcite , the instantaneous volatility follows a mean - reverting arithmetic ornstein - uhlenbeck process , and heston  @xcite introduced correlation in the preceding model , just to name a few .",
    "another standard limitation of the black - scholes formula is that it is restricted to european derivatives : the option can be exercised at maturity only .",
    "however , most of the exchange - traded options are american : they can be exercised anytime during the life of the contract .",
    "once again there is a clear connection with typical problems in physics : the earliest analysis of the issue of pricing american derivatives was formulated by mckean  @xcite as a free boundary problem for the heat equation .",
    "kim  @xcite provided an integral representation of the option price but , unfortunately , we have nowadays no explicit expression for the american counterpart of the black - scholes formula . the kernel of the problem is in that , in general , the optimal exercise boundary is implicitly defined by the integral equation that determines the price of the option . only under certain circumstances closed expressions for american option prices do exist : e.g. in the case in which the properties of the derivative lead to a constant early exercise price , as in rubinstein and reiner  @xcite , or when the option is perpetual , as in kim  @xcite , and also in elliott and chan  @xcite , where the stock is driven by fractional brownian motion . in the most general scenario",
    "analytical or numerical approximate methods must be used instead see , for instance , barone - adesi and whaley  @xcite , broadie and detemple  @xcite , ju  @xcite , broadie _ et al _",
    "@xcite , and references therein as well .    in this article",
    "we will generalize a market model first introduced by herzel  @xcite as a simplified version of naik s work .",
    "naik  @xcite developed a model in which the volatility can take only two known values , and the market switches back and forth between them in a random way .",
    "herzel let the volatility jump at most once : a suitable way for encoding a market that may undergo a severe change in volatility only if some forthcoming event takes place .",
    "herzel formally solved the problem of pricing european options if the market price of volatility risk was constant .",
    "the problem was revisited in  @xcite , where different risk premiums were considered and some explicit solutions were found . here we will tackle the problem of pricing perpetual american options within a framework where volatility but also dividend rate may perform a single transition at some unknown instant in the future .    the paper is structured as follows : in we present the market model and its general properties . in we introduce the concept of financial derivative , and explore the links between finance and physics in the context of american derivatives . is devoted to the subject of pricing perpetual american options : we stress the financial interest of these ideal derivatives and emphasize the potentials of the analytical expressions found . in we show some illustrative examples and discuss their implications .",
    "conclusions are drawn in , and the paper ends with two appendices . in  [ sa ]",
    "we revisit the problem by following a different approach , and  [ sb ] deals with the smooth pasting condition for vanilla options .",
    "let us begin with the general description of our set - up . we will consider a financial market where the non - deterministic stock @xmath0 is traded . the price evolution of this stock , assuming that @xmath1 at @xmath2 , is the following : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a wiener process , a one dimensional brownian motion with zero mean and variance equal to @xmath5 .",
    "the drift , @xmath6 , and the volatility , @xmath7 , are stochastic quantities whose initial values are @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "after @xmath10 they may simultaneously change to different fixed values , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , but such a transition can take place only once in a lifetime : @xmath13 @xmath14 throughout the text @xmath15 will denote the indicator function , which assigns the value 1 to a true statement , and the value 0 to a false statement . note that if @xmath16 , we will have a market model with stochastic volatility .",
    "the case in which @xmath17 has in principle a more flexible interpretation , although we will concentrate our attention in the existence of two different ( continuous in time ) dividend pay - off regimes : @xmath18 these magnitudes are stochastic because the instant @xmath19 in which the transition occurs is a random variable .",
    "we will assume that @xmath20 follows an exponential law : @xmath21 note that  ( [ pp ] ) identifies @xmath22 as the inverse of the mean value of the transition waiting time interval @xmath23 , @xmath24=\\lambda^{-1}$ ] .",
    "in the previous expressions and hereafter @xmath25 represents _ all _ the available information up to time @xmath5 .",
    "the asset behaviour may be easily visualized when we express it in terms of returns , @xmath26 , instead of spot prices .",
    "the return will follow a drifted wiener process with parameters @xmath27 up to time @xmath20 .",
    "after that time the initial brownian motion freezes and a second drifted wiener process drives the subsequent evolution of the return : @xmath28 with @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .    in the most common situation",
    "the stock @xmath0 and its derivatives , contracts whose price depends upon the value of this underlying , are the only securities affected by the actual value of @xmath20 .",
    "when part of the risk is not directly traded in the market , the market may be incomplete : we will not be able to reproduce the behaviour of some assets by means of a _ replicating _ portfolio . in our case , if we want to hedge the market exposure of derivatives to volatility or dividend risk we must also include in the portfolio _ secondary derivatives _ ,",
    "derivatives with the same underlying stock but different contract specifications .",
    "the immediate consequence of such constraint is that the risk premium coming from @xmath20 is arbitrary to a certain extent , because investors can evaluate it on the basis of their own perceptions .",
    "we will avoid entering into the discussion of the financial consequences of this arbitrariness now : we leave it to  [ sa ] , where the hedging - portfolio approach is taken . the most relevant point to be noted here",
    "is that we can use  ( [ pp ] ) in order to define a risk - neutral measure for @xmath0 , @xmath31 ^ 2}{2 \\sigma_a^2 ( t - t_0 ) } } \\right.\\\\ + \\left .",

    ".   \\label{martf}\\ ] ] note that physical and risk - free measures coincide when @xmath38 .",
    "options are contracts between two parties , sold by one party to another , that give the buyer the right , but not the obligation , to buy ( call ) or sell ( put ) shares of the underlying stock at some prearranged price , the _ strike _ price @xmath39 , within a certain period or on a specific date , the maturity or expiration time @xmath40 . sometimes @xmath39 is a parameter but in general , depending on the contract specifications , it will be a function involving some other constants : @xmath41 we will use the generic sign @xmath42 as a shorthand for all the contract parameters . as a consequence of their privileged position , option holders will only exercise their rights if they obtain a net benefit . in other words , we can see options as contingent claims with their present value determined by the discounted value of the expected profit under our risk - neutral measure : @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the pay - off function and @xmath45 is the actual exercise time .",
    "the notation we use in the definition of the pay - off function is not incidental .",
    "we will concentrate our attention on those contracts for which the pay - off is a function of the current value of the asset , like in the case of vanilla calls ( + ) and puts ( - ) where @xmath46 and @xmath39 is constant .",
    "another typical pay - off is @xmath47 we can derive this pay - off from  ( [ kb ] ) and  ( [ payv ] ) : it corresponds to binary or digital options . for the sake of simplicity we will set @xmath48 hereafter .",
    "vanilla and binary options will be the only instances we will study in practice , although some other contracts may fit our requirements as well .",
    "note that this is not the case of any exotic derivative whose pay - off depends on the past path of the stock , like in asian options , lookback options or _ knock - out _ options .",
    "when the option can be exercised at the end of the contract lifetime @xmath40 only , the exercise time is deterministic , and the option is said to be european .",
    "if the option can be exercised at any time before expiration it is called american , and @xmath45 becomes an stochastic magnitude as well .",
    "note that the contract is always worthless after maturity : the option buyer must decide under which conditions the option can be optimally exercised before this deadline .",
    "the decision will finally depend on the present value of stock price @xmath49 and the time to expiration , @xmath50 .",
    "the problem is thus in essence a typical problem of first - passage time : we must determine at what time the process @xmath49 will touch the boundary @xmath51 . in financial language , @xmath51 is named the optimal exercise boundary , the stock price above ( below ) which it is better to exercise the call ( put ) than to keep the option alive .",
    "we will define the exercise time @xmath52 as the first time the underlying crosses the threshold given that at present time , @xmath10 , the spot price of the asset lies in the proper side of the boundary : @xmath53    the optimal strategy for choosing the boundary function derives from the following constraint : the investor must settle @xmath51 in such a way that the value of the alive option equals the pay - off of the contingent claim in the optimal exercise price , @xmath54 the condition must be fulfiled in a smooth way as well , the smooth pasting condition  @xcite : @xmath55 in the case in which the right - hand side of the previous expression does exist .",
    "that is , the option price must be continuous with continuous derivative in the asset price when it crosses the boundary . in conclusion ,",
    "the investor must compute function @xmath51 at the same time he or she evaluates the option price .",
    "we analyse now the problem of valuating perpetual american options , i.e. when we have @xmath56 .",
    "it can be objected that perpetual american options have limited practical interest since , in general , actual derivatives expire . in this sense",
    ", one can argue that they represent the limiting value of a far from maturity contract , and therefore they may help in the pricing process if the theoretical price can not be computed  @xcite . on the other hand , the existence of a fixed expiration time is a feature which is not shared by systems coming from other branches of science .",
    "the results we introduce in this section may be thus of interest in different fields .",
    "we will stress this interpretation later .",
    "the major simplification that perpetual american options bring is that the value of the boundary must be piece - like constant , @xmath57 given that the problem is stationary .",
    "then , since the process @xmath49 is continuous , we will have : @xmath58\\nonumber \\\\&+&x^{\\pm}(h_b;{\\mathbb{k } } ) { \\mathbb{e}}[e^{-r({t^{\\pm}}_0-t_0)}{\\mathbf 1}_{{t^{\\pm}}_0 > \\tau}|{\\mathcal{f}\\/}(t_0 ) ] , \\label{ppm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the problem is simpler in the case of binary options since there is no financial reason for holding the option alive once we are in the bonus region .",

    "in fact , for @xmath92 , or what is the same , for @xmath93 , the value of @xmath85 diverges : there is no optimal boundary , the option is never exercised and , as a consequence , it must quote as its underlying stock , @xmath94 . thus",

    "clearly this is only feasible if the value of the parameters are well tuned : @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath162 and @xmath182 . the outcome fits our anticipation , since the possibility of a larger volatility increases the uncertainty about the mean exercise time .",
    "in this article we have considered the implications that the presence in the market of volatility and dividend risk has for option prices .",
    "the proposed market model allows random changes in both the dividend - payment rate and the volatility level of stock shares , but in a very specific way : only one change is feasible , and the final market properties are foreseeable .",
    "the model , however , is rich and realistic enough to obtain valid financial results .",
    "we have focused our attention on the problem of pricing perpetual american options : derivatives with no expiration limit that may be exercised at any time .",
    "the absence of maturity in a derivative departs from actual market conditions , but it is a well - accepted approximation used with the purpose of casting light on the way of solving the whole problem . from a physical point of view , the analysis of perpetual options may have even bigger interest than real options because , usually , physical systems do not disappear after a fixed time lag .    within this framework , we have obtained explicit solutions for pricing derivatives with the most typical pay - offs : vanilla puts and calls , as well as binary options .",
    "nevertheless , the applications of our development are not restricted to finance since , as we have pointed out , binary option prices are nothing but classical moment - generating functions of a first - passage time . we have shown the right way of handling these expressions within our set - up .",
    "we have illustrated our results with a set of practical examples covering the major issues we have analysed .",
    "the most intriguing aspect of our outcomes is the possible existence , depending on the actual market conditions , of a threshold that limits the probability of change in order to have a valid price .",
    "we have found no sound clue that may explain the financial meaning of this behaviour , beyond the fact that in such a case the smooth pasting condition can not be satisfied .",
    "we believe that this feature deserves deeper analysis in a forthcoming work .",
    "we aim to extend these results to american derivatives with maturity date as well .",
    "it is probable that the solution to this problem will imply the use of approximate procedures and numerical techniques to some extent .",

    "in this appendix we will present a supplementary approach to the issue .",
    "both methods lead to the same results but differ in the way in which they are obtained .",
    "this fact can made a technique more suitable than the other when discussing some properties of the model , like the question of the completeness of the market .",
    "this alternative approach is based on the idea that the fair price of an option must be equal to the value of some portfolio made of different securities that mimics the behaviour of the derivative and hedges all the risk .",
    "in fact , the market will be complete if we can construct such _ hedging portfolio _ for every traded asset of the market .",
    "the first security to be included in the portfolio is the underlying asset , which will reproduce changes in the option price due to the evolution of the stock price @xmath0 .",
    "the second security in our portfolio is a zero - coupon bond , a free - risk monetary asset , with a market price @xmath183 that satisfies the following differential equation : @xmath184 a long position in this security will provide a secure resort where to keep the benefits of an effective investment strategy , whereas a short position in these bonds will allow us to borrow money when we need it .",
    "these two securities can not counterbalance all the stochastic behaviour of the price of the option however : not all the influence of @xmath185 and @xmath186 on the option price may be explained through @xmath0 ; and @xmath183 is fully deterministic .",
    "therefore , we need another security that can account for this contribution to the global risk . nevertheless , in the most of the cases , markets do not trade such assets , a fact that impel us to consider the inclusion of a _ secondary _ option in the portfolio : a derivative of the same nature of @xmath187 , but with a different set of contract specifications , @xmath188 . in particular we will focus on the case in which they share the same expiration date but",
    "differ on the striking price .",
    "note that we will assume as well that the option price is a function of the _ current _ value of the underlying .",
    "let us write down @xmath189 as a mixture of @xmath190 shares @xmath0 , @xmath191 units of the riskless security @xmath183 , and @xmath192 secondary options @xmath193 : @xmath194 the variation in the value of the portfolio , due to the market evolution of its components and the received dividends , fulfils the following relationship : @xmath195 where we have taken into account that @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath196 are predictable processes , and that we adopt a _ self - financing strategy _ , in which there is no net cash flow entering or leaving the replicating portfolio .",
    "this differential change must equal the expression obtained after applying the rules of it calculus on the price of the option : @xmath197 where @xmath198 and @xmath199 is the price of the option after the jump .",
    "the differential of an indicator with a random variable in its argument may seem a bizarre object .",
    "however , it is mathematically well defined .",
    "in fact , @xmath200 is a submartingale under our measure and , by virtue of the doob - meyer decomposition theorem , @xmath201 can be expressed as a sum of two terms , @xmath202 , an increasing adapted process @xmath203 , @xmath204 and a cadlag martingale @xmath205 , @xmath206 .",
    "\\label{mdef}\\ ] ] the key point is that @xmath201 is a stochastic magnitude , independent of @xmath207 , which does not directly contribute to the variation of the stock price @xmath208 .",
    "therefore , it is a source of risk that can not be explained in terms of the random evolution of the underlying asset .    the combination of  ( [ dp ] ) and  ( [ itodp ] ) , together with  ( [ db ] ) , lead to : @xmath209 now , we can proceed with @xmath210 in an analogous way , @xmath211 where the natural definition of @xmath212 , @xmath213 has been used . in order to recover a deterministic partial differential equation",
    "we must guarantee that terms containing the stochastic magnitudes @xmath208 and @xmath201 mutually cancel out .",
    "therefore we must demand that @xmath214 a condition named _ delta hedging _ , and also that @xmath215 which is usually referred as _",
    "vega hedging_. the previous hedging conditions reduce  ( [ pde_1 ] ) to @xmath216 an expression that still involves @xmath183 , which is not an inner variable of option prices @xmath189 and @xmath193 in our set - up . with @xmath183 as the free variable . ]",
    "this problem can be fixed using the definition of the portfolio in  ( [ pdef ] ) and the _ vega hedging _ together , @xmath217 the replacement of @xmath218 in  ( [ cbnd ] ) leads to @xmath219 this formula implies the existence of an arbitrary function @xmath220 , which uncouples the problem of finding @xmath189 and @xmath193 : @xmath221 obviously the same formula is valid for the secondary option , merely by replacing @xmath189 with @xmath193 .",
    "this proves that the option @xmath193 removes the remaining risk and therefore completes the market .    the financial interpretation of @xmath220 is discussed in more depth in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the must known facts are four : ( i ) @xmath220 depends on how every investor measures the volatility and dividend risk , what prevents us from fixing it , ( ii ) prior to the change it must be negative defined or otherwise the market will show arbitrage opportunities , ( iii ) after the change must be zero and , finally , ( iv ) the choice @xmath222 avoids the so - called statistical arbitrage , the growth of the expected value of the _ discounted _ price of the option , @xmath223 .",
    "the violation of this condition is against the capital asset pricing model which states that any hedged portfolio with a zero market risk must have an expected return equal to the risk - free rate .",
    "it can be easily shown that this choice for @xmath220 lead to the desired property : from  ( [ itodp ] ) and  ( [ chi ] ) it follows that @xmath224 can be decomposed in two parts , @xmath225 where @xmath226 was defined in  ( [ deff ] ) and @xmath227 .",
    "on the one hand @xmath226 is ( and must be ) a martingale under our measure see  ( [ martf ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , if we set @xmath228 with @xmath203 defined as in  ( [ adef ] ) , we will have that @xmath229 equals @xmath205 see  ( [ mdef]) , and therefore becomes a martingale as well , what proves our previous statement .",
    "note however that in general @xmath220 may depend on the two independent variables @xmath5 and @xmath0 , on market properties @xmath32 , @xmath196 , @xmath7 and @xmath20 , but also on the common contract specification @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , financial arguments see for instance @xcite lead to the conclusion that the natural time variable in option pricing problems is not @xmath5 but @xmath230 , the time to maturity .",
    "this convention , for instance , turns the pay - off function into an initial condition in european - like contract problems @xmath231 and removes explicit temporal dependence from perpetual derivative problems , also in the optimal exercise barrier of american options @xmath232 .",
    "this reduces  ( [ chi ] ) to an ordinary differential equation : @xmath233 the solution if the jump has taken place does not depend on @xmath220 since the equation to be solved is  @xcite : @xmath234 here @xmath220 becomes meaningless and thus we can freely set @xmath235 .",
    "the general solution of  ( [ odepb ] ) for @xmath236 reads @xmath237 where @xmath81 were defined in the main text cf  ( [ betapm]) , and constants @xmath238 and @xmath239 can be obtained by demanding the solution to fulfil boundary conditions  ( [ continuity ] ) and  ( [ smooth ] ) , if applicable : e.g. @xmath240 and @xmath241 lead to a perpetual american binary put , @xmath242 and @xmath243 to a perpetual american vanilla call , and so forth .",
    "the solution if the jump has not taken place yet _ does _ depend on the arbitrary function @xmath220 .",
    "the development in the main text is consistent with  ( [ thechi ] ) , i.e. @xmath244 . in this case  ( [ odep ] ) reduces to : @xmath245 whose general solution is @xmath246 , \\label{odepasol}\\ ] ] whenever @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "expressions for @xmath249 and @xmath250 have been already introduced in the main text , in  ( [ gamma ] ) and  ( [ ell ] ) respectively .",
    "once again the arbitrary constants in  ( [ odepasol ] ) must be evaluated on the basis of contract specifications : for example @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 reproduce the price of a perpetual american binary call .",
    "clearly , the previous method is well suited to discuss most of the financial assumptions and implications of the market model but dilutes the connections of the issue with other branches of knowledge .",
    "the fact that the solution of  ( [ odep ] ) is related to a first - passage time problem may be not so evident at first glance , for instance .",
    "the way of recovering the results corresponding to the use of the physical measure is also a delicate question .",
    "these and other reasons impelled us to follow in the main text a development which is akin to physicists , and to leave the mathematical finance approach to this appendix .",
    "in this appendix we analyse the properties of the smooth pasting condition for vanilla options : formula  ( [ hh ] ) in the main text .",
    "let us first define the auxiliary function @xmath254 , @xmath255 with @xmath256 the study of this function is relevant in our framework since @xmath128 fulfils @xmath257 remember that @xmath85 was introduced in  ( [ hb ] ) .",
    "the properties of @xmath81 and @xmath249 impel us to treat separately call and put optimal boundaries . for call options we will have that @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "we will dismiss the particular case @xmath133 because it was analysed in  . moreover , the only scenario in which @xmath260 corresponds to a very specific situation : @xmath261 and @xmath159 , the jump never takes place . therefore , @xmath262 and @xmath263 are bounded and positive constants , @xmath264 fulfils @xmath265 and @xmath266 , and it shows a single maximum at @xmath267 : @xmath268 that means that the equation @xmath269 may have two solutions , one solution or no solution at all , depending on the value of @xmath270 . when the parameters lead to @xmath271 for any value of @xmath22 we will have two formal solutions , but we can easily reject one of them by analysing the properties of the boundary for large and small values of @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , condition  ( [ cp ] ) is always satisfied for small enough values of @xmath22 since @xmath272 the previous statement is false if @xmath273 , i.e. when the stock pays no dividend before the change .",
    "in this case we will have found no parameter choice which fulfils  ( [ cp ] ) whenever @xmath274 . in particular",
    ", it is easy ( but tedious ) to show that if @xmath275 and @xmath141 then @xmath276 for all @xmath277 .",
    "let us assume again that @xmath278 . under these assumptions , and depending on the market value of the parameters",
    ", may exist a threshold for @xmath22 , @xmath166 , above which no optimal boundary can be defined : @xmath279 in fact , for @xmath280 , we will have a single solution : @xmath281    this situation is also present in the estimation of the optimal boundary for puts .",
    "here we have @xmath282 and @xmath283 , what leads to the conclusion that @xmath284 and @xmath285 are also bounded and positive constants , that the auxiliary function @xmath286 fulfils @xmath287 , @xmath288 , and that @xmath289 , @xmath290 is a global minimum of @xmath286 .",
    "the condition for the existence of a solution for the optimal boundary problem now reads : @xmath291 and , like in the call case , it will be satisfied for small values of @xmath22 because @xmath292 therefore we may have a threshold in @xmath22 depending on the market properties as well .",
    "let us show this behaviour through a practical example .",
    "consider the case @xmath293 . here",
    "the constraint  ( [ cm ] ) is equivalent to demanding @xmath294 .",
    "this means that for @xmath295 we will always find a optimal boundary , whereas for @xmath296 there will be solution only in the range @xmath297 the value of @xmath128 , when it exits , follows : @xmath298 note that @xmath128 shows the right limiting properties @xmath299 and @xmath300 .",
    "we have a plausible explanation of the absence of solution for any value of @xmath22 in the case of calls on non - paying dividend shares : the perpetual american call behaves like the underlying and thus there is no optimal boundary .",
    "the financial interpretation of the existence of threshold @xmath166 , but only under some market conditions , is elusive .",
