    "the properties of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas and in particular the phenomena induced by isolated or clustered impurities embedded in it have attracted a large volume of experimental and theoretical research .",
    "the interest stems from the increasingly more ideal realisations of the 2d electron gas , for example , at interfaces of semiconductor heterostructures , at semiconductor surface inversion layers , at ( noble ) metal surfaces as schockley surface states or as quantum well states in metallic overlayers on insulators or on other metals . at the same time the development of different photoelectron and scanning tunneling spectroscopies",
    "has enabled an increasingly more accurate characterization of these systems @xcite .",
    "many experiments deal directly or indirectly with the existence of bound electron states in systems interacting with the 2d electron gas .",
    "the impurity - induced electron localization has been studied in the schockley surface state systems @xcite . the quantum diffusion of hydrogen on metal surfaces reflects the coupling of the hydrogen with the metallic ( possibly 2d ) electron gas @xcite .",
    "finally , a bound state between two electrons in a 2d electron gas has been proposed as an alternative pairing mechanism to the phonon coupling for high - temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it was explicitly pointed out @xcite that the many - body ground state of a dilute gas of fermions is unstable to pairing if and only if a two - body bound state exists .",
    "the background for the above - mentioned physics is laid by basic mathematical theorems .",
    "first , in two dimensions , for any everywhere attractive circularly symmetric potential , @xmath0 , there exists always a bound state no matter how weak the potential is . for the case of a shallow potential valley characterized by the @xmath3 condition ,",
    "an explicit expression for the binding energy , @xmath4 , was derived in the textbook by landau @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the binding energy depends exponentially on the inverse of a negative constant ( given by the condition ) in the investigated",
    "_ weak_-coupling limit .",
    "the theorem of simon @xcite extends the conditions for a bound state to the @xmath5 case , i.e. , to the not everywhere nonpositive or not everywhere nonnegative _",
    "suitable _ potentials .    in this work we present a numerical analysis for the existence of a 2d bound state in potentials fulfilling the @xmath6 condition .",
    "the physically motivated effective potentials , @xmath7 , will refer to the perfectly shielded fields of embedded attractive or repulsive unit - charges in a 2d electron gas , and @xmath8 plays the role of a convenient coupling constant to detailed numerics . in the repulsive case",
    "the screening is constrained by the fact that the maximum of the surrounding hole density is the uniform electron gas density . beside the cases based on the mentioned standard condition , the overscreening and underscreening of unit - charges ( with @xmath9 )",
    "shall be investigated as well .",
    "the corresponding potentials could mimic the shielding - dynamics in , for example , standing wave generation @xcite on surfaces in the presence of impurities .",
    "slightly surprisingly we find a bound state also for the overscreened attractive and underscreened repulsive potentials . in order to treat also the electron - electron effective interaction we use in the schr \" odinger equation the reduced mass @xmath10 .",
    "the energy of the ensuing bound electron pair has a minimum at a certain electron gas density .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , sec .",
    "ii , we shall deduce our physically motivated model potentials to numerical , 2d bound - state calculations .",
    "the results obtained are presented on illustrative figures , by considering relevant parameter - ranges in coupling , screening - tuning , and density of the electron gas . finally , sec .",
    "iii is devoted to a short summary .",
    "hartree atomic units , @xmath11 , will be used in the equations and discussion below .",
    "we begin with few mathematical expressions . the 2d fourier - hankel ( f - h ) transformation of a @xmath12 function is    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the zeroth - order bessel function .",
    "the inverse f - h transform has the form    @xmath15    these equations will be used below , in model - potential constructions .    the field of an embedded charged particle is shielded in the 2d electron gas . thus instead of the bare coulomb form , @xmath16 , one can write in momentum space    @xmath17,\\ ] ]    for the shielded field around unit - charges of different signs . here",
    "@xmath18 is the screening density in momentum - space . with a unit - norm @xmath19",
    "one obtains , via the above eqs.(1 ) and ( 3 ) , the @xmath20 limiting behaviour _ if _ the real - space density decays faster than @xmath21 .",
    "this case corresponds to the @xmath22 condition of simon s theorem .",
    "notice , that the well - known @xcite quasiclassical , thomas - fermi ( @xmath23 ) approximation for impurity screening in a 2d electron gas results in a _",
    "potential    @xmath24    negative and positive signs in eq.(4 ) refer to embedded attractive and repulsive unit charges , respectively . at large distances ( @xmath25 )",
    "the @xmath26 potential falls of as @xmath27 , and one gets the @xmath28 condition .",
    "therefore , this type of potential with negative sign belongs to the class analyzed by landau @xcite .",
    "we shall characterize the @xmath19 density _ directly _ by the properly normalized hydrogenic @xmath29 and gaussian @xmath30 forms , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding fourier - hankel transforms are @xmath33 and @xmath34 $ ] , respectively . using the former in eq.(3 ) and applying eq.(2 ) , we get    @xmath35\\right),\\ ] ]    in which @xmath36 for shorthand .",
    "the gaussian - form results in    @xmath37    where @xmath38 . in the above equations @xmath39 and @xmath40 are modified bessel functions .",
    "we stress that @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath5 in these models . for long distances these shielded potentials decay as @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the attractive potentials are exhibited in fig . 1",
    ", by fixing @xmath44 ( solid curve ) and @xmath45 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the @xmath44 value could correspond to a strictly atomistic , @xmath46-like in 2d , electron density . for a detailed comparison ,",
    "two other potentials are also plotted .",
    "that is , the bare coulomb one , @xmath47 , and the conventional thomas - fermi form , @xmath26 of eq.(4 ) .    in order to go beyond the @xmath5 condition",
    ", one may multiply the _ shielding _ parts of eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) by a @xmath48 variable [ see eqs .",
    "( [ attrv ] ) and ( [ repv ] ) below ] . in such a way we can investigate the overscreened ( @xmath49 ) and underscreened ( @xmath50 ) cases , for which @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , as discussed above the effective potentials have a multiplicative coupling constant @xmath52 , [ @xmath53 . in our 2d numerics @xmath8 and @xmath48",
    "will serve as convenient parameters .",
    "the bound - state energy levels ( @xmath54 ) and wave functions [ @xmath55 satisfy the 2d schr \" odinger equation    @xmath56\\ ,   { \\psi}({\\bf \\rm r})\\ , = \\ , 0 , \\label{schr}\\ ] ]    where @xmath57 is the reduced mass ; it is unity for the impurity - electron case .    in circular symmetry",
    "the wave function separates as    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the azimuthal quantum number and @xmath60 is the radial quantum number related to the number of radial nodes @xmath61 of the radial wave function @xmath62 . in this work",
    "we are only interested in the values @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "further , by making the substitution @xmath65 we obtain the differential equation    @xmath66 - \\frac{(m^{2}-1/4)}{r^{2}}\\right ) u_{mn}(r)=0.\\ ] ]    this is the same form as the radial equation studied in spherically symmetric problems .",
    "we solve the equation on an exponentially expanding radial mesh , @xmath67 with @xmath68=1  @xmath69 . with a given guess for the eigenvalue @xmath54",
    "the function @xmath70 is integrated outwards from origin and inwards from a large radius by starting with its asymptotic expansions . at a matching point close to the classical turning point",
    "the logarithmic derivatives of the outward and inward integrated solutions are required to coincide by adjusting the eigenvalue @xmath54 .",
    "the parameters of the radial mesh , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath69 are varied until the numerical convergence of the eigenvalue is obtained .      according to our numerical calculations , the attractive @xmath26 of eq.(4 ) gives @xmath73 , while the @xmath74 of eq.(5 ) results in @xmath75 values for @xmath76=4 , in hartree units .",
    "there is an about order - of - magnitude reduction in binding due to an atomistic screening , beyond quasiclassics .    in",
    "order to study the so - called not everywhere nonpositive case ( physically : the shielded positive charge ) in more detail we will use , without loss of generality , @xmath44 in eq.(5 ) and modify it as @xmath77\\right ) .",

    "the @xmath48-tuning refers to small under- and overscreening .",
    "the figure clearly shows the sensitivity of binding on the details of shielding . for @xmath49 one",

    "@xmath48=1 , are given in fig .",
    "3 with @xmath82 $ ] . in this case @xmath83 for any ( finite ) @xmath8 , as we pointed out earlier . in harmony with simon s theorem @xcite , @xmath84",
    ", we get for our case [ @xmath81 ] an about @xmath86 value for the suitable constant in the investigated coupling - parameter range .",
    "the macroscopic dielectric constant of a real medium can result in reduced , @xmath87 values to effective interactions .    in this attractive impurity case",
    "we have shown a remarkable sensitivity of theoretical bound - state characteristics to shielding conditions .",
    "this is in accord with important spectroscopic information obtained @xcite by scanning tunneling spectroscopy for different adatoms in generated standing wave patterns .",
    "the observed peak - shift and amplitude - decrease in differential tunneling conductance , as adatoms are approached to a step on the surface , signal the experimental sensitivity .",
    "we note that our detailed numerical analysis is based on an effective schr \" odinger equation .",
    "further attempts are needed therefore to consider the many - body aspects of the localization problem in more detail .",
    "for example , the _ proper _ description of the width of an adatom - induced weakly bound state and its influence on scattering characteristics are important questions to future studies .      the so - called not everywhere nonnegative case ( physically : the shielded negative charge )",
    "will be treated similarly via eq.(5 ) of positive sign , but with the constraint @xmath88 in order to model bounded , complete depletion of the 2d electron gas density at @xmath89 . here",
    "@xmath90 is the density - parameter of the 2d gas with density @xmath91 .",
    "the same constraint is used to the corresponding ( positive sign ) reparametrized eq.(6 ) with @xmath92 as @xmath93 where , according to the above discussion , @xmath94 now .",
    "remember , that at @xmath95 one has @xmath96 , independently of the value of a finite @xmath8 .    as we use the depletion - constraint - based densities to model effective electron - electron interactions , it is important to give an additional physical argument on their proper behaviour .",
    "the interaction energy ( @xmath97 ) of a repulsive point charge with the surrounding , normalized ( @xmath95 ) shielding hole can be characterized by the classical equation    @xmath98    this equation results in the @xmath99 , and @xmath100 expressions for the exponential and gaussian screening , respectively .",
    "these energies are _ between _ the values based on the exchange - only , @xmath101 , and wigner - monatom , @xcite @xmath102 , limiting approximations .",
    "the latter corresponds to the @xmath103 extremum model for the hole - density , while the former to the pauli - hole @xcite of an ideal 2d system .",
    "the two repulsive potentials , discussed above in details , are used in eq.([schr ] ) with the reduced mass @xmath10 , and the following numerical results are obtained .",
    "the binding energies @xmath104 are plotted in fig .",
    "4 , as a function of the density parameter @xmath90 .",
    "computed values are connected by solid ( the case of exponential shielding ) and dashed ( the case of gaussian model ) curves .",
    "the other parameters behind these results are fixed as @xmath105 .",
    "remarkably , there are @xmath90 parameter values at which the binding energies are optimal , i.e. , they have extremal values . by increasing or decreasing the density of the electron gas ,",
    "the bindings become weaker .",
    "the extremal values are at about @xmath106 for the hydrogen - like model , and at @xmath107 for the gaussian model .",
    "the binding energies are in the @xmath108 range in atomic units , for the dilute system .",
    "the low carrier density and thus a small fermi energy , @xmath109 , are _ important _ characteristics of cuprate superconductors @xcite . in these materials",
    "the ratio of the critical temperature ( @xmath110 ) and the fermi energy is in the range of @xmath111 .",
    "furthermore , there is a saturation and supression of @xmath110 with increasing carrier density ; for further detail we refer to fig . 3 of ref.[16 ] .",
    "the observed extremal character is related , physically , to our pseudononlinear construction of effective shielding of repulsive charges .",
    "namely , the constraint via the bounded depletion hole at @xmath89 fixes a reasonable scaling in the potentials . in standard linear - response theory",
    "@xcite the hole - density at @xmath89 can become higher than the host density @xmath91 .",
    "in such an attempt one can get a monotonic dependence of @xmath112 on @xmath90 in the resulting shielded fields .",
    "further information is given in figs .",
    "5 and 6 , which show the 2d radial densities , @xmath113 , computed with _ bound - state _ wave functions at the extremal wigner - seitz parameters .",
    "the corresponding potentials are also plotted .",
    "as expected , the square - integrable wave functions are localized at about the potential minima . in the investigated equal - mass case",
    "this extension can represent a certain coherence - lenght ; somewhat surprisingly it is only twice of the extremal density parameter .    as we observed in fig .",
    "3 for the attractive case , the binding energy depends on the coupling , @xmath8 .",
    "an illustration on this fact for the repulsive case is given in fig .",
    "the gaussian model of eq.([repv ] ) is used with @xmath95 , @xmath10 , and @xmath114 .",
    "results for @xmath87 are plotted .",
    "we can approximate our data by a quadratic expression , i.e. , @xmath115 .",
    "rescaling of @xmath9 by a macroscopic dielectric constant could result in a notable reduction of the above - mentioned ( see , fig .",
    "4 , also ) binding energies .",
    "we finish our representation , by discussing the question of undershielding the repulsive charge .",
    "8 is devoted to this problem .",
    "we have used eq.([repv ] ) with @xmath9 and @xmath50 in the schr \" odinger equation , eq.([schr ] ) with @xmath10 , at @xmath114 .",
    "one can observe ( see , fig .",
    "2 , for the attractive case ) essential reductions of energies for the @xmath116 unconventional condition .",
    "the last results of figs . 7 and 8 , together with figs .",
    "4 - 6 , signal a nontrivial sensitivity of the magnitude of the binding energy on the concrete physical situation .",
    "fortunately , there is a physical limitation .",
    "it should be clear from the discussion at eq.([holeint ] ) , and as our illustrative figures indeed show , that a more localized real - space character of the bounded ( and normalized ) depletion hole around a repulsive unit - charge , results in an effective potential with a repulsive part of a shorter range .",
    "clearly , the limitation is given by the wigner model , in which one has the @xmath103 extremum for the hole .",
    "in this work we have investigated the problem of bound states in two - dimensional shielded potentials .",
    "effective potentials , based on direct approximation for the screening charge densities around attractive and repulsive unit charges , are employed .",
    "particularly , the effective electron - electron interaction is modelled via a properly constrained depletion hole . in the detailed numerical analysis",
    "performed , we found that in both of the basically attractive , and basically repulsive potentials bound states appear under the @xmath117 standard , and may appear under the @xmath118 unconventional conditions . in the repulsive case",
    "an extremal character of the binding energy , as a function of the density of the host 2d electron gas , is established with our physical models for effective electron - electron interactions .",
