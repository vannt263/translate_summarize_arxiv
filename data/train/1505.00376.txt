    "measurement of the photon polarization in @xmath4 radiative decays has been of long - standing interest . within the standard model ( sm ) , flavor - changing electroweak interactions maximally violate parity , so that one expects the fraction of left - handed photons in @xmath4 processes to be order unity , up to small corrections arising from either the non - zero strange quark mass or from higher order qcd contributions .",
    "in contrast , certain new physics ( np ) scenarios may generate @xmath5 operators of comparable size to the sm terms , but with exotic parity structure , significantly modifying the expected ratio of left- versus right - handed photons  the photon polarization ratio .",
    "measurement of this ratio therefore has the potential to test the parity structure of @xmath5 operators against sm expectations , as well as either constrain or detect the signatures of such np scenarios .",
    "the @xmath5 photon polarization ratio may be measured via various different approaches .",
    "dominantly right - handed photon production in resonant @xmath6 generates an up - down asymmetry of the photon momentum with respect to the @xmath7 decay plane @xcite .",
    "this up - down asymmetry was recently measured by the lhcb collaboration  @xcite . however , a theoretical prediction for the asymmetry is not yet available , so that the photon polarization ratio can not yet be extracted from these results or compared to sm expectations . along similar lines ,",
    "the photon polarization ratio may also be probed by measuring the spin fraction of @xmath8 s in unpolarized @xmath9 decays @xcite , or by measuring an angular asymmetry between the @xmath10 spin and the outgoing photon momentum for polarized @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "other methods look for time dependent cp violation induced by mixing of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which is proportional to the photon polarization ratio @xcite .",
    "additionally one may probe the polarization ratio by looking for asymmetries in angular observables in resonant @xmath13 or @xmath14 @xcite , or look for transverse asymmetries in the dilepton invariant mass for non - resonant @xmath15 @xcite .    in this work we focus on the @xmath16 process ,",
    "in which the on - shell photon subsequently undergoes bethe - heitler ( bh ) nuclear conversion inside the detector to a lepton - antilepton pair . the cross - section for bh",
    "pair conversion of @xmath17 gev photons is approximately two ( eight ) orders of magnitude larger than the compton ( rayleigh ) scattering cross - section ( @xcite ; see chapter 32 ) , so that to an excellent approximation the emitted photon does not decohere before conversion .",
    "the @xmath18 photon polarization ratio , @xmath19 , is precisely defined via the amplitude ratio @xmath20 in which @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is a relative weak ( strong ) phase . in the sm , @xmath19 is expected to be at most @xmath23 @xcite , while the weak phase @xmath21 is suppressed by @xmath24 .",
    "hence measurement of not only @xmath19 , as discussed above , but also @xmath21 may test sm expectations : measuring either @xmath19 or @xmath25 would be highly suggestive of np effects .",
    "measurement of @xmath19 via bh conversion was first considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that analysis ,",
    "the @xmath26 meson was assumed to be at rest relative to the conversion nucleus .",
    "further , the conversion itself was assumed be to a perfect linear polarizer of the photon , so that the conversion leptons and photon are constrained to be coplanar .",
    "however , in practice the @xmath26 meson is typically at least semi - relativistic , and typically an @xmath3 fraction of conversion events have non - negligible acoplanarity ( see e.g. ref .",
    "this leads to a richer phase space structure for the outgoing conversion leptons , kaon and pion .",
    "moreover , interference effects between the @xmath18 decay and the bh conversion amplitudes were not included . the key motivation to reconsider the above analysis , then , is to include these @xmath26-boost , acoplanarity and interference effects .",
    "we exploit recent compact results for bh conversion spin - helicity amplitudes @xcite to construct the full @xmath27 amplitude , and show that interference between its decay and conversion components permits both @xmath19 and @xmath21 to be probed by the kinematic configuration of the final state conversion leptons , kaon and pion . in particular , we develop an angular observable that probes both of these parameters .",
    "this new analysis admits arbitrary boosts of the parent @xmath26 meson relative to the bh conversion nucleus , and includes lepton - photon acoplanarity , which turns out to play an important role in enhancing the @xmath19- and @xmath21-sensitive interference effects .",
    "performing an experiment to measure @xmath19 and @xmath21 with this technique will be challenging .",
    "in the first instance , precise reconstruction of the leptonic momenta is required , which can only be achieved , even in principle , if the leptonic opening angles are larger than the angular resolution of the detector .",
    "typically , the leptonic opening angle after bh conversion is @xmath28 , for typical photon energies in a @xmath18 decay with a semirelativistic @xmath26 .",
    "specifically , for a photon of energy @xmath29  gev , the probability for @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is @xmath32% ( @xmath33% ) . hence exquisite angular resolutions will be required .",
    "a further complicating factor is the multiple rescattering of the leptons in the detector material after conversion .",
    "the rms rescattering angle in matter is @xmath34 @xcite , where @xmath35 is the path length inside the detector in units of radiation length .",
    "for @xmath36 few %  a typical value  the rescattering angle is comparable to the typical opening angle , @xmath37 .",
    "finally , the probability of photon conversion itself is typically low at current and planned @xmath26 factories , being at most of order a few percent .",
    "this probability depends mildly on the detector design .",
    "for example , it is approximately 3% , 2 - 3% , and 6% at babar  @xcite , lhcb  @xcite , and belle ii  @xcite respectively .",
    "for all these reasons , this technique will likely only be feasible with a dedicated detector element that has a large scattering length , e.g. a gaseous tpc @xcite .    for these reasons",
    ", in this work we shall restrict ourselves to a thought experiment - type approach .",
    "that is , we develop explicit analytic expressions for amplitudes and observables with respect to the underlying @xmath27 process alone , but do not include smearing from leptonic rescattering and limited kinematic resolution , or realistic detector simulations .",
    "based on the results of this work , future studies may perhaps incorporate these latter effects .",
    "keeping operators up to dimension five , the effective theory of interest for @xmath11 and @xmath38 decays may be written in the general form @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and the dimensionful couplings generically contain relative strong phases .",
    "we consider only @xmath41 decays to charged pseudoscalars , i.e. @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "the sign of the pion or kaon charge therefore tags the @xmath41 versus the @xmath44 , and hence tags the parent meson as either a @xmath26 or @xmath45 , up to electroweak loop suppressed corrections .",
    "hence we neglect interference effects from @xmath26-@xmath45 mixing .",
    "we assume the conversion nucleus is spin-@xmath46 , e.g. a @xmath47si nucleus , which is the dominant silicon isotope .",
    "the external quantum numbers for the full @xmath48 helicity amplitudes are then just the spins of the electron and positron , denoted @xmath19 and @xmath49 respectively .",
