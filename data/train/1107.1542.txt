    "this can be a second flow by chance aligned in the same position angle with the major one .",
    "alternatively , once the outflow direction is close to the plane of the sky and its inclination angle becomes smaller than the opening angle @xmath89 , its front and back sides will exhibit opposite doppler shift .",

    "the shocked region at @xmath106 shows moderate abundances which are comparable or even slightly lower than in mm2 .",

    "the modeled spectra of @xmath32 and 1 towards mm2 is much lower than the observed line profile while the @xmath113 lines are all well fitted .",
    "the excess emission in @xmath32 and 1 lines may largely arise from the cold outer - envelope gas .",
    "the rotation temperature is also evaluated from the thermally excited ch@xmath0oh lines at the core center using the rotation diagram method  @xcite .",
    "the column density of the upper level @xmath114 is related to the line intensity in the form @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the upper - level degeneracy .",
    "@xmath117 is the line strength , @xmath118 is the dipole moment . @xmath114",

    "@xmath122 is then estimated from a least - square fit ( figure 3b ) .",
    "the derived values are listed in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath122 derived from ch@xmath0oh and ch@xmath0cn are remarkably similar for mm1 .",
    "for mm2 , however , the @xmath122 of ch@xmath0oh is lower than that of ch@xmath0cn . as a probable reason , the ch@xmath0oh lines generally have lower @xmath123 than ch@xmath0cn ( @xmath31 ) , then the cooler outer - part gas would contribute more significantly to the ch@xmath0oh lines than to the ch@xmath0cn ( in particular @xmath124 to 6 ) .",
    "in addition the ch@xmath0oh can be easily released from the dust grains by the shocks while the ch@xmath0cn production requires subsequent gas - phase reactions and stellar heating  @xcite .",
    "ch@xmath0cn may therefore be distributed closer to the mm2 center ( as seen in figure 2a ) , and showing a higher @xmath122 .    for the other species ,",

    "the abundances in mm2 are generally 3 to 4 times higher than those in mm1 .",
    "the so shows the highest abundance ratio of 4.5 .",
    "we note that the temperature adopted for mm2 ( 70 k ) is conservative .",
    "a higher @xmath138 would yield a lower n(h@xmath35 ) and higher @xmath139 for most species , hence leading to even higher abundances .",
    "for instance , adopting the value of @xmath140 k as the @xmath138 for mm2 , we will have @xmath141 @xmath142 that is 3 times larger than the current value .",
    "the molecular distribution appears to be influenced by the outflow . besides the coherent elongation of so and ocs with the hvc of @xmath1co emission ( figure 2b ) , the ch@xmath0oh and hnco emissions",
    "are also largely distributed to the west of mm2 . in addition , all the molecular lines have broader line widths in mm2 than in mm1 , e.g. the so line has @xmath143 in mm2 and 3.4 km s@xmath4 in mm1 .",
    "the line widths of mm2 can be broadened by a kinetic energy input from the outflow .",
    "considering its influence to the molecular line profiles , the outflow may also contribute to the higher abundances in mm2 .",
    "specifically , there would be underlying shocks which are induced as the outflow is interacting with the envelope and/or infalling gas  @xcite .    at the near- to mid - ir and sub - millimeter wavebands ,",
    "the two cores have similar flux densities ( table 1 ) .",
    "at irac bands mm2 is brighter than mm1 at 5.8 and 8 @xmath16 but weaker at 3.6 and 4.5",
    "@xmath16 , while at 2mass @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath33 bands , only mm1 is significantly detected ( figure s2 ) . having a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) obviously skewed to the shorter wavelengths ( @xmath146 ) ,",
    "mm1 may have a more evolved stage for its stellar disk system  @xcite .",
    "however , since the outflow in mm2 is close to the plane of the sky , it is also possible that a disk / toroid structure lies edge - on in mm2 thus would largely absorb the short - wave emissions .",
    "a higher resolution will be helpful in revealing the morphology of the stellar system and underlying shocks in mm2 .",
    "we present a multi - wavelength study towards the young high - mass star forming region g23.44 - 0.18 .",

    "<S> we present an observational study towards the young high - mass star forming region g23.44 - 0.18 using the submillimeter array . </S>",
    "<S> two massive , radio - quiet dusty cores mm1 and mm2 are observed in 1.3 mm continuum emission and dense molecular gas tracers including thermal ch@xmath0oh , ch@xmath0cn , hnco , so , and ocs lines . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1co ( 21 ) line reveals a strong bipolar outflow originated from mm2 . </S>",
    "<S> the outflow consists of a low - velocity component with wide - angle quasi - parabolic shape and a more compact and collimated high - velocity component . </S>",
    "<S> the overall geometry resembles the outflow system observed in the low - mass protostar which has a jet - driven fast flow and entrained gas shell . </S>",
    "<S> the outflow has a dynamical age of @xmath2 years and a mass ejection rate @xmath3 year@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a prominent shock emission in the outflow is observed in so and ocs , and also detected in ch@xmath0oh and hnco . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the chemistry of mm1 , mm2 and the shocked region . </S>",
    "<S> the dense core mm2 have molecular abundances of 3 to 4 times higher than those in mm1 . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance excess , we suggest , can be a net effect of the stellar evolution and embedded shocks in mm2 that calls for further inspection .    </S>",
