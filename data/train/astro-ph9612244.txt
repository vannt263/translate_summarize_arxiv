    "follow - up observations with the vla at centimeter wavelengths led to the discovery of relativistic ejections of plasma clouds with apparent superluminal motions ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 , 1995 ; rodrguez & mirabel 1995 ) .",
    "+ here we report the results from a multi - wavelength approach to determine the distance and environment of this unique x - ray source .",
    "the millimeter and centimeter wavelengths observations yield constraints on its kinematic distance and give clues on the environment of the source .",
    "this source is located near the galactic plane at @xmath13 , @xmath14 and due to interstellar extinction it is better observed in the infrared ( mirabel et al .",
    "1994 ) . to constrain the nature of the binary system ,",
    "imaging and spectroscopic observations were carried out in the j ( @xmath15 ) , h ( @xmath16 ) , and k ( @xmath7 ) bands .",
    "the comparison between this source and other well known x - ray binaries is also discussed .",
    "using the very large array ( vla ) in configuration d on 16 december 1993 , rodrguez et al .",
    "( 1995 ) observed with a resolution of @xmath17 the @xmath18 line absorption spectra of @xmath19 along the lines of sight to @xmath0 and to the @xmath20 region @xmath21 .",
    "the latter is the closest @xmath20 region on the sky at a projected distance of @xmath22 from the high - energy source .",
    "its radial velocity with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) is @xmath23 .",
    "the kinematic distance of this @xmath20 region can be unambiguously known combining the @xmath18 absorption with the h109@xmath24 and h110@xmath24 emission ( downes et al .",
    "1980 ; matthews et al . 1977 ; baud 1977 ) . assuming that the sun is at a galactocentric distance of @xmath25 , the @xmath20 region is at @xmath26 from the sun .",
    "the @xmath18 opacities toward @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "[ grsabs ] .",
    "since there is absorption in both the @xmath20 region and @xmath0 up to @xmath27 ( which corresponds to the lsr velocity of the subcentral point for the galactic longitude @xmath28 ) , both the @xmath20 region and @xmath0 are beyond @xmath29 from the sun ( radhakrishnan et al .",
    "+    the line of sight to @xmath0 exhibits additional @xmath19 absorption at @xmath30 relative to the line of sight to @xmath21 , implying that this additional @xmath19 absorption is farther than the @xmath20 region @xmath21 .",
    "so @xmath0 appears to be behind an @xmath19 cloud , which is at a kinematic distance of @xmath31 , beyond @xmath21 . on the other hand ,",
    "since there is no absorption at negative velocities below @xmath32 , @xmath0 must be at a kinematic distance @xmath33 , which is consistent with the relativistic upper limit of the distance derived by mirabel & rodrguez ( 1994 ) .",
    "therefore we can constrain the kinematic distance of @xmath0 to the range @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath19 absorption denotes a column density of atomic gas @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the spin temperature .",
    "this column density is 1.42 times the column density along the line of sight to the @xmath20 region @xmath21 . assuming a constant @xmath19 absorption per unit length , @xmath0 would then be at a kinematic distance @xmath1 ( rodrguez et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "low resolution observations of the interstellar molecular gas have been discussed by castro - tirado et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and grindlay ( 1994 ) . using the columbia co survey ( dame et al . 1986 ) , they found that along the line of sight to @xmath0 there are molecular gas complexes at the kinematic distances of 1.5 and 7.8 kpc .",
    "however , due to the low angular resolution of the columbia survey , no molecular cloud core was detected on the line of sight , and therefore no evidence for association between the source and a giant molecular cloud was found .",
    "+ we used the 30  m radiotelescope of the institut de radioastronomie millimtrique ( iram ) for a search in the direction of @xmath0 of molecular gas associated with the additional @xmath19 absorption detected with the vla at @xmath30 .",

    "this transition is a good density tracer , for molecular hydrogen densities of @xmath38 ( sanders et al . 1983 ) .",

    "the coordinates of this reference off region are : @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "+ figure [ coprofile ] shows the @xmath37 spectrum toward @xmath0 .",
    "there is an emission peak of the co at the velocity @xmath41 , close to the lsr velocity of the atomic component that causes the additional absorption in @xmath19 . in the following",
    "we assume that the @xmath19 absorption detected with the vla at the velocity @xmath30 and the co feature detected with the 30  m telescope of the iram at @xmath41 come from the same cloud .",
    "therefore we adopt the far distance for the co component , and its doppler shift corresponds to a kinematic distance of @xmath2 .",
    "the velocity width of the molecular cloud is @xmath42 .",
    "+    to study the distribution of the molecular gas at given doppler shifts , we made maps of the co emission with velocities covering the following intervals in km.s@xmath43 : ( @xmath44,0 ) , ( 0,10 ) , ( 23,30 ) , ( 26,28 ) , ( 28,30 ) , ( 40,43 ) , ( 43,46 ) , ( 46,50 ) , ( 57,60 ) , ( 60,62 ) , and ( 62,70 ) . with these intervals of velocities",
    "we mapped the co emission with kinematic distances as far as @xmath45 .",
    "the only map that shows a local maximum of the co emission near the projected position of @xmath0 is the map of the co detected in the range of velocities between 40 and @xmath46 , centered at @xmath47 .",
    "this map is shown in fig .",
    "[ comap ] . from it",
    "we can conclude that @xmath0 is behind the core of a molecular cloud located at the kinematic distance @xmath48 from the sun .",
    "+    the molecular cloud superimposed upon the position of @xmath0 has a diameter of @xmath49 , which corresponds to a physical size of 2.9 pc for a kinematic distance of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the mean density of the molecular cloud is @xmath51 .",
