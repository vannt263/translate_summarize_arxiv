    "perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations in leading or next - to - leading order predict very small or no asymmetry in the @xmath8 or @xmath9 distributions for charm and anticharm production@xcite . however , fixed target data show some asymmetry between the production of some charm and anticharm hadrons in hadron - hadron interactions@xcite .",
    "selex has shown strong , beam - dependent asymmetries in @xmath10 production@xcite .",
    "this experiment finds that @xmath11 production from a @xmath3 beam ( but not a @xmath6 beam ) also has a large production asymmetry .",
    "this asymmetry could be due to the fact that the beam hadron shares a quark with one of the charge states ( hence leading particle ) and not with the other charge state ( non - leading ) .",
    "this is sometimes called  the leading particle effect . \"    for a @xmath3(@xmath12 ) beam the @xmath0(@xmath13 ) shares an @xmath14 quark with the beam hadron and is a leading particle , whereas @xmath15 is not . for a @xmath6(@xmath16 )",
    "beam , neither @xmath0 nor @xmath1 is leading .",
    "several theoretical models have been proposed to explain charm hadroproduction in the framework of non - perturbative hadronization . among the proposed models are the color - drag string model@xcite , which is pronounced at high @xmath8 and is independent of @xmath9 , and the intrinsic charm model@xcite , which manifests itself at low @xmath9 and larger @xmath8 .",
    "data were taken during the 1996 - 97 fixed target run at fermilab .",
    "the 600 gev / c negative hadron beam used in this measurement was composed of approximately 50% @xmath3 and 50% @xmath6 .",
    "beam particles were tagged with a transition radiation detector system located upstream of the charm production target .    a segmented target consisting of two copper sheets and three diamond sheets , each spaced by 1.5 cm , was used to produce charm particles .",
    "the total target thickness was @xmath17 of an interaction length for protons .",
    "the selex experiment used a three - stage spectrometer designed for large acceptance at @xmath18 and for detecting the decay of charm particles .",
    "each stage included a bending magnet and a detector system .",
    "selex used an online trigger to identify charm particles .",
    "the hardware trigger required at least 4 charged hadrons in the forward 150 mrad cone and 2 hits from positive track candidates in a hodoscope after second magnet ( m2 ) .",
    "the software trigger made a full vertex reconstruction of the beam track and all tracks in the m2 spectrometer .",
    "trigger conditions were also included in the simulation .",
    "the rich detector , located after the second spectrometer system , was filled with neon gas at room temperature and 1.05 atm pressure .",
    "it identified charged hadrons whose trajectories went through the fiducial volume , typically requiring @xmath19 23 gev / c@xcite .",
    "full reconstruction of the secondary vertex was provided by linking rich - identified tracks back through the second stage magnetic spectrometer to the vertex silicon detector and associating them at a common decay vertex downstream of the primary interaction vertex .",
    "initial data selection required two kaons to be identified by the rich ( ratio of the likelihoods : @xmath20 ) and the primary vertex to be in a target sheet .",
    "the criteria used to select @xmath21 candidates included the following cuts :    \\i ) secondary vertex separation significance @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the longitudinal separation between primary and secondary vertex and @xmath24 is the error on @xmath23 .",
    "\\ii ) secondary vertex was at least 100 microns outside of the target material .",
    "\\iii ) each secondary track was extrapolated back to primary vertex @xmath25-position to evaluate the transverse miss distance @xmath26 .",
    "the second largest miss distance had to have @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the error on @xmath26 .",
    "these cuts were chosen to reject as many background events as possible without losing too much signal .",
    "they were optimized using real background and simulated signal events by maximizing the so - called significance : @xmath29 where @xmath30 was the yield from a monte carlo data set .",
    "the numbers of signal ( @xmath31 ) and background ( @xmath32 ) events inside the square root were taken from data ( all the events within the mass interval of 50 mev/@xmath33 centered at @xmath21 mass value ) .",
    "the cuts are identical for the charge conjugate modes .",
    "none of the results presented here is sensitive to this optimization procedure .",
    "since the rich detector does not separate particles with absolute certainty , we expect some small amount of misidentification between pion and kaon that causes a reflection of @xmath34 under the @xmath35 peak ( detailed work on the contamination has been reported in ref  @xcite measurement of @xmath21 lifetime ) . only resonant ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) channels were considered for this analysis to reduce the contribution of these reflections significantly .",
    "@xmath11 charm meson decays to @xmath38 were selected by starting with candidate @xmath39 decays .",
    "the invariant mass for two well - reconstructed oppositely charged tracks , identified as kaons by rich , was calculated .",
    "@xmath40 candidates were those pairs whose invariant mass was within @xmath4110 mev / c@xmath42 of the @xmath40 mass ( 1020 mev / c@xmath42 ) .",
    "similarly , those @xmath43 combinations that include a @xmath44 pair with an invariant mass value within @xmath4135 mev / c@xmath42 of @xmath45 mass ( 892 mev / c@xmath42 ) were selected as @xmath46 decays .",
    "we have obtained 172@xmath4114 @xmath0 and 54@xmath418 @xmath1 in @xmath36 channel and 174@xmath4114 @xmath0 and 71@xmath4112 @xmath1 in @xmath37 channel for @xmath470.15 with the @xmath3 beam .    with",
    "the above cuts the @xmath35 peaks are clearly evident in the invariant mass spectra of @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( figure  [ fig : mass ] ) .",
    "this figure also shows cabbibo - suppressed @xmath50 peaks .",
    "there is a clear excess of @xmath0 over @xmath1 as seen in the figure .",
    "determining the yields through fitting the mass histograms for a specific @xmath8 value by a monte - carlo generated shape is often inaccurate for small statistics and fluctuating backgrounds . in selex",
    "the yield at a specific @xmath8 value was estimated using a sideband subtraction method assuming a linear background .",
    "the mass ranges of the sideband background windows were [ 1.900 gev/@xmath33 , 1.940 gev/@xmath33 ] and [ 2.060 gev/@xmath33 , 2.140 gev/@xmath33 ] .",
    "we defined asymmetric sidebands to avoid the influence of @xmath52 and to exclude the d*(2010 ) mass region .    the yields after sideband subtraction were corrected for the acceptance ( reconstruction efficiency and geometrical acceptance ) of the detector .",
    "to estimate the acceptance , @xmath21 events were generated by a monte carlo program with a flat distribution in @xmath8 and a gaussian - distributed transverse momentum with mean @xmath9=0.8 gev / c . in a given simulation data set the @xmath53 decays only into the @xmath37 or @xmath36 mode .",
    "decay tracks were digitized after smearing with detector resolution and multiple coulomb scattering effects .",
    "the detector hits were ored into the hit banks of interaction data .",
    "the new hit banks were passed through the selex off - line software .",
    "the acceptance was measured using the ratio of the reconstructed events to the embedded events .",
    "the set of cuts that was used to extract the signal was applied in this case as well .",
    "the most important issue for the asymmetry measurement was the relative efficiency of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "as indicated in figure  [ fig : eff4paper ] , the average difference in acceptance between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is very small over all @xmath8 range compared to the statistical uncertainty .",
    "this shows that the spectrometer is charge independent for @xmath21 decay events . in figure only the acceptance for @xmath36 channel",
    "the acceptance for @xmath37 channel is slightly lower .",
    "the acceptance in @xmath8 is independent of @xmath54 .",
    "after all the cuts and acceptance corrections , the resulting @xmath21 yields as functions of @xmath8 are shown in figure  [ fig : xf ] and listed in table  [ xf_asym ] .",
    "resulting data points are fit to a functional form @xmath55 .",
    "the values of @xmath56 obtained from the fits are shown on the figure .",
    "since the beam flux was the same for @xmath35 , the two distributions compare the relative production differential cross - sections for these states .",
    "figure 3 shows that , for the @xmath3 beam used in this measurement , @xmath0 production is favored over @xmath1 at all @xmath8 , and the difference increases at large @xmath8 .",
    "we can discuss this difference in terms of an asymmetry parameter @xmath57 , defined as    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the corrected yields for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the asymmetry was calculated for five equally divided bins over an @xmath8 range of 0.15 to 0.40 and for three equally divided bins over an @xmath8 range of 0.40 to 0.70 .",
    "figure  [ fig : asym ] displays the acceptance - corrected asymmetry as a function of @xmath8 for the @xmath3 beam .",
    "it shows that there is a significant asymmetry in favor of @xmath0 and that the asymmetry increases gradually as @xmath8 increases .",
    "the asymmetry values are included in table  [ xf_asym ] .",
    ".summary of @xmath0 and @xmath1 yields and asymmetries from @xmath3 beam .",
    "the errors are statistical only .",
    "yields are obtained from resonant state @xmath61 and @xmath62 events . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure  [ fig : ptasym ] displays the asymmetry as a function of @xmath63 .",
    "these asymmetry values are also corrected for acceptance .",
    "one can see that the asymmetry is flat within the observed range ( up to @xmath64 )    in order to further explore the leading particle effect , the analysis was repeated with data from the @xmath6 beam , obtained under the same conditions as with the @xmath3 beam . because pion beam statistics are much lower , we compare only integrated asymmetry results for all @xmath43 events with @xmath65 . for the @xmath6 beam , which has no leading particle ,",
    "the integrated asymmetry is consistent with zero ( @xmath57 @xmath66 0.06@xmath410.11 ) . on the other hand , analysis of the @xmath3 beam data in the same way results in a large asymmetry in favor of @xmath0 ( @xmath57 @xmath66 0.53@xmath410.06 ) .",
    "studies of possible systematic errors due to the side - band subtraction method were done by varying the size and position of the side bands .",
    "effects of changing @xmath8 bin sizes on the results were also investigated .",
    "systematics of the acceptance calculations have been checked with meson asymmetries and polarizations , all of which should be zero and are . the false asymmetry due to our hardware trigger was also studied . even when combined together ,",
    "these effects are all considerably smaller than the statistical uncertainty and are neglected .",
    "the contribution of the misidentification of @xmath6 beam particles as @xmath3 is estimated to be a few percent .",
    "the resulting dilution in the asymmetry is negligible .    as mentioned before , background including the @xmath34 contamination under the @xmath67 peak",
    "is highly reduced by limiting data to the resonant states .",
    "effects of the remaining background were studied by comparing the integrated asymmetries obtained from the two resonant states . in the @xmath36 case all backgrounds , including @xmath50 contamination , are negligible and can not affect the asymmetry .",
    "the @xmath62 integrated asymmetry is 0.52@xmath410.06 . for the @xmath37 channel",
    "it is 0.42@xmath410.08 .",
    "the effect of the contamination reported in ref  @xcite would reduce a real @xmath37 asymmetry of 0.52 to an observed value of 0.48 , statistically compatible with observation .",
    "the overall dilution effect is much smaller than the statistical uncertainties in individual bins and is not included in the final results ( table i and figure 4 ) .",
    "to summarize : the @xmath68 beam data show a strong production asymmetry favoring @xmath69 production .",
    "this is consistent with leading particle effects .",
    "however , the integrated asymmetry from @xmath6 beam at @xmath470.15 for @xmath35 meson is 0.06@xmath410.11 , which is consistent with zero asymmetry as expected since neither @xmath1 nor @xmath0 is a leading particle .",
    "our @xmath3 results are consistent with the previous measurement done by wa89 experiment at cern with 340 gev / c @xmath3 beam .",
    "the selex pion result of negligible integrated asymmetry agrees with the higher - statistics differential distribution for a 500 gev @xmath6 beam reported by e791@xcite .",
    "their integrated asymmetry in the @xmath8 range 0.1 to 0.5 is 0.032@xmath410.022 .",
    "our results also favor the color drag model over the intrinsic charm model , since the color drag model predicts a large asymmetry at large @xmath8 independent of @xmath9@xcite .",
