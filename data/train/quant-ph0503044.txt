    "einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) @xcite suggested that quantum mechanics was incomplete and that hidden variables may be needed for completion .",
    "this was the subject of an extensive debate with bohr @xcite who denied the existence of such hidden variables using his well known reasoning that is at the basis of the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "a mathematical non - existence proof for these hidden variables was presented by von neumann within the framework of quantum mechanics .",
    "bell @xcite , however , showed that von neumann s proof assumed the simultaneous measurability of certain quantities that could not possibly be simultaneously measured .",
    "subsequently bell himself presented a non - existence proof @xcite in form of inequalities that are derived by using more complex assumptions that did not necessarily include simultaneous measurability .",
    "the inequalities of bell @xcite are derived by the use of probability theory , in essence by the use of very elementary facts about random variables within the framework pioneered by kolmogorov .",
    "the derivation of the inequalities does not involve physics or quantum mechanics , yet the inequalities have assumed an important role for the foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "this role is a consequence of the assumptions for the random variables ( and other possible variables ) that are used to derive the bell inequalities .",
    "it is commonly believed that these assumptions are needed and moreover are equivalent to the basic postulates of an  objective local \" parameter space @xcite .",
    "these postulates or conditions encompass einstein - locality and the existence of elements of reality in the sense of mach that co - determine the outcome of measurements .",
    "the fact that some results of quantum mechanics violate the bell inequalities has therefore led to the belief that no objective local parameter space can exist that explains all the results of quantum mechanics .",
    "subsequent to these discussions experiments were proposed @xcite , @xcite and later realized @xcite that confirmed the theoretical result of quantum mechanics .",
    "this seemed to leave only difficult options for theoretical physics such as ( i ) to deny that the microscopic entities of physics have objective reality ( non - existence of objective local parameters ) or ( ii ) to assert that an influence can be propagated faster than the speed of light @xcite .",
    "additional options involving the validity of counterfactual reasoning have also been suggested and will be discussed below .",
    "we show in this paper that because of the historical sequence of events , viz .",
    "the development of bell s theory before the performance of the actual experiments , some very important facts of probability theory have not been considered and/or misinterpreted . these facts are connected with the concept of a probability space that is important to link probability theory and mathematical statistics to the evaluation of actual experiments . we reconsider here these concepts and show that violations of the bell inequalities have a purely mathematical reason , in particular that the bell inequalities represent a special case of theorems given earlier by bass @xcite , vorobev @xcite , @xcite and schell @xcite .",
    "these theorems permit us to deduce that , for all the possible bell inequalities to be valid , it is a necessary and sufficient condition that the random variables involved in their proof are defined on one common probability space . beyond this",
    "we show that the requirement of the use of one common probability space does not follow from the requirements of objective local spaces and vice versa .",
    "in fact , we show that there exist objective local random variables that can not be defined on a common probability space and therefore do not need to obey the bell inequalities . as mentioned , bell has dismissed von neumann s proof that assumed from the start the simultaneous measurability of the observables that correspond to our random variables and that can not be measured simultaneously .",
    "our contribution here is that we also dismiss non - existence proofs of certain systems of random variables that need to be defined on one common probability space when it is clear from the outset that these systems of random variables can not be defined on any common probability space .",
    "we believe that our results give additional options of explanation for aspect - type experiments without violating relativity or denying objective reality .",
    "as outlined above , probability theory provides a probability space and random variables and the link to the statistical treatment of the data from an actual experiment .",
    "bell @xcite considered an experimental situation advocated by bohm and aharonov @xcite , and by bohm and hiley @xcite .",
    "this proposal was transformed into an actual experiment by aspect et al .",
    "@xcite including the suggestion of bell and others that a rapid change of the settings needed to be implemented to accomplish a delayed choice situation @xcite .",
    "we develop now an idealized experiment and a probability model for this actual experiment by aspect et al within the framework of kolmogorov .",
    "we note that our procedure also applies to other related experiments .",
    "we first recall the concepts of a ( discrete ) probability space and of a random variable defined on it . as feller states @xciteif",
    "we want to speak about experiments or observations in a theoretical way and without ambiguity , we first must agree on the simple events representing the thinkable outcomes ; _ they define the idealized experiment _ ...... by definition _ every indecomposable result of the ( idealized ) experiment is represented by one , and only one , sample point_. the aggregate of all sample points will be called the _ sample space_. \" in our case of the idealized epr experiment , the simple event can be chosen , for example , as the event of sending out one ( and only one ) correlated pair . with this event",
    "we associate an element @xmath0 . in order to avoid mathematical technicalities that are not needed for the purpose of our paper",
    "we assume that the sample space @xmath1 is at most countable .",
    "each simple event @xmath2 is assigned the probability @xmath3 that @xmath0 occurs .",
    "@xmath4 is a set function , defined for all subsets of @xmath1 , that satisfies the usual axioms , such as countable additivity and it assigns to @xmath1 the value @xmath5 . the pair @xmath6 is called a probability space .",
    "a random variable is a real - valued function on @xmath1 , but if needed it also can assume values in high - dimensional space .",
    "we now turn to the specifics of an idealized epr - experiment .",
    "a correlated spin pair in the singlet state is sent out from a source in opposite directions toward measurement stations .",
    "these stations are characterized by certain randomly and rapidly switched settings which we denote by three dimensional unit vectors @xmath7 .",
    "the measurements in the stations are mathematically represented by random variables @xmath8 that may in turn be functions of other random variables e.g. a source parameter @xmath9 that characterizes all the properties of the particles sent out from the source .",
    "@xmath10 indicates that the measurements that correspond to the outcomes of random variable @xmath10 have been performed using the setting @xmath11 and similarly for @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we perform three categories of experiments , each with a different pair of setting vectors .",
    "the first category is characterized by the vectors @xmath11 in station @xmath14 and @xmath15 in station @xmath16 . according to our notational convention we denote the pair of measurements @xmath17 and the joint probability density of @xmath10 and @xmath12 by @xmath18 .",
    "thus @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 @xmath20 the second category of experiments will be characterized by the vectors @xmath11 in @xmath14 and @xmath21 in @xmath16 with the resulting pair of measurements @xmath22 having density @xmath23 , and the third category by the vectors @xmath15 in @xmath14 and @xmath21 in @xmath16 resulting in a pair of measurements @xmath24 with density @xmath25 .",
    "the measurement outcomes on both sides need to be completely random and @xmath26 with equal probability , i.e. all three distributions have identical marginals .",
    "this is dictated by the rules of quantum mechanics and verified by experiment . from this",
    "it follows that the @xmath27 have the center of gravity for their point masses at the origin @xmath28 and @xmath29    the idealized mathematical model with exactly the properties described above and used within the framework of kolmogorov is the basis for all our further considerations and we call it the ma - epr model .",
    "we start with an example that illustrates the theorems of bass @xcite and vorobev @xcite for the special case of the ma - epr model .",
    "the essential point of these theorems is that , in general , it is not possible to find three random variables @xmath30 and @xmath13 , defined on a common probability space such that the three pairs @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 of random variables have their joint densities equal to @xmath34 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "hence the notation that is commonly used and that we also introduced in section 2 above is misleading in the sense that it suggests there exist three random variables @xmath30 and @xmath13 that can reproduce the joint densities @xmath18 , @xmath23 and @xmath25 , when in fact they can not . here is a modification of an example of vorobev @xcite .",
    ".vorobev - type example @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is easy to show that under the assumption of eq([bv1 ] ) the joint pair densities can be expressed in terms of the covariances @xmath35 defined by these pair densities .",
    "the pair densities are then given by table [ ta : ob ] ( see also the lemma below ) .",
    "note that the covariances @xmath36 do not exceed @xmath37 in absolute value .",
    "suppose now that there exist three random variables @xmath38 defined on one common probability space that reproduce the densities @xmath39 in table [ ta : ob ] .",
    "then @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the expectation value .",
    "expressing the entries of table [ ta : ob ] in terms of the eight unknown probabilities @xmath44 will result in a system of twelve linear equations in these eight unknowns that can be solved in an elementary way .",
    "in particular , solving this system shows that these eight probabilities can be expressed in terms of the three covariances @xmath45 .",
    "it turns out that five of these twelve linear equations are redundant .",
    "thus this system has infinitely many solutions .",
    "taking into account that the solutions of this system represent probabilities @xmath46 we obtain in a straightforward way that the following four inequalities are necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the consistency problem for the three pair distributions given in table [ ta : ob ] : @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50    of course , the necessity part of this conclusion can be shown directly and trivially by modifying the standard proofs of the bell inequality along the lines shown in @xcite .",
    "replacing the covariances @xmath51 by the corresponding expectation values , one obtains from eqs.([bvcc2]-[bvcc3 ] ) : @xmath52 and @xmath53 eqs.([bv6 ] ) and ( [ bv7 ] ) give @xmath54    this is , of course , one of the celebrated bell inequalities .",
    "five more can be obtained in analogous fashion from eqs.([bvcc1]-[bvcc4 ] ) giving a total of 6 ( 4 choose 2 ) .",
    "these can also be obtained by cyclic permutation in eq.([bv8 ] ) and replacing both minus signs by plus signs .",
    "bass @xcite proved that for three general pair distributions the consistency problem can be solved if and only if the triple @xmath55 considered as a point in @xmath56 belongs to a certain domain . in the special case",
    "we have been considering this domain reduces to the tetrahedron defined by the inequalities of eqs.([bvcc1]-[bvcc4 ] ) .",
    "we shall call it the covariance tetrahedron .",
    "it is diplayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tetrahedra ] .",
    "we formulate now our findings for the ma - epr experiment as a theorem .",
    "we first collect a few facts of section 3 above in form of a lemma .",
    "lemma : let @xmath57 be a density supported on the four vertices @xmath58 of a square .",
    "suppose that @xmath59 then @xmath60 where the sums are extended over the four points @xmath61 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath57 satisfies eq.([bvcc6 ] ) then @xmath57 also satisfies eq.([bvcc5 ] ) .    set @xmath62 with the same proviso for the sum",
    ". then @xmath57 can be expressed in terms of @xmath51 by the equations @xmath63",
    "@xmath64    theorem1 : let @xmath39 be three probability densities satisfying the hypotheses of the lemma with corresponding covariances @xmath65",
    ". then the following statements are equivalent    1 .",
    "the point @xmath66 satisfies the system of inequalities eqs.([bvcc1]-[bvcc4 ] ) and therefore belongs to the covariance tetrahedron .",
    "the point @xmath55 satisfies the following six bell - type inequalities @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 3 .",
    "there exist three random variables @xmath38 defined on a single common probability space with the following properties .",
    "the joint probability densities of @xmath70 and @xmath24 are @xmath34 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "in particular , the expectation values equal @xmath71 the covariances equal @xmath72 using eqs.([bvcc10 ] ) and ( [ bvcc12 ] ) one obtains the six bell inequalities for the expectation values @xmath73 .",
    "proofs : the proof of the lemma is straightforward . the proof that conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) of theorem1 are equivalent can be done by inspection .",
    "the proof that ( iii ) implies ( ii ) or the six bell inequalities obtained from eq.([bvcc10 ] ) and eq.([bvcc12 ] ) can be carried out by a simple modification of the standard proof of the bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "finally , the proof that ( i ) implies ( iii ) was outlined at the end of section 3 .",
    "we have shown therefore the following .",
    "the inequalities of bell are a special case of the theorems of bass and vorobev for the ma - epr experiment .",
    "if the 6 bell inequalities are valid then it is possible to find three random variables @xmath30 and @xmath13 , defined on one common probability space that reproduce the three joint pair densities @xmath74 of table [ ta : ob ] and their covariances @xmath75 and @xmath42 .",
    "these covariances satisfy the bell inequalities . therefore , if quantum mechanics predicts that , for a given idealized experiment involving random variables @xmath30 and @xmath13 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , one of the six bell inequalities in eq.([bvcc10 ] ) will be violated or equivalently if the point with coordinates @xmath79 does not belong to the covariance tetrahedron of fig .",
    "[ fig : tetrahedra ] , then the random variables @xmath30 and @xmath13 , that are supposed to form the basis for the model of this idealized experiment , can not be defined on one common probability space .",
    "we note that the work of fine @xcite has already shown the importance of a joint density and therefore of a common probability space in the derivations of bell - type inequalities .",
    "the importance of a common probability space was also stressed more recently in @xcite and other publications .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the definability of @xmath30 and @xmath13 on one common probability space ( ocps ) is a necessary and sufficient condition for the validity of bell s inequalities and that this condition is of a purely mathematical nature and has nothing to do with the questions of non - locality or counterfactual reasoning that usually surround discussions of the bell inequalities .",
    "the condition is , however , related to some of the physics of epr experiments in a variety of ways that will be discussed in section 6 .",
    "we add here that other inequalities of similar type such as the clauser - horne - holt - shimony ( chhs ) @xcite inequalities can be treated similarly , although with greater algebraic exertion ( 16 linear equations in 16 unknowns ) .",
    "their validity is again a necessary and sufficient reason that all involved random variables are defined on one common probability space .",
    "in fact , a theorem analogous to theorem1 above holds , with the covariance tetrahedron replaced by a four - dimensional polytope .",
    "this polytope equals the intersection of the four - dimensional parallelepiped , defined by the four chhs inequalities , and the four - dimensional cube with vertices @xmath80 .",
    "the details will be published elsewhere .",
    "in view of the ocps condition and the theorems of bass and vorobev , the proofs for the bell inequalities as given by bell and others become obvious and at the same time lacking physical justification .    consider bell s original proof @xcite . here",
    "bell assumes that all random variables @xmath38 are in turn functions of a single random variable @xmath9 .",
    "then it is clear that @xmath38 are defined on one common probability space and therefore the inequalities can not be violated by the pair expectation values as explained above .",
    "it is clear that no @xmath9 can exist that leads to a violation of the inequalities for purely mathematical reasons as already found by bass much earlier .",
    "bell s physical justification is wanting because he attempts to show that the inequalities follow from the fact that @xmath9 does not depend on the settings @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , it does not matter on what @xmath9 depends as long as the resulting @xmath30 and @xmath13 are random variables defined on one probability space .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail below .",
    "other well known proofs @xcite invoke  counterfactual \" reasoning of the following kind : if , for example , @xmath10 is measured given a certain information that we denote by @xmath82 ( a value that @xmath9 assumes in a given experiment ) and that is carried by the correlated spin pair , then one could have measured with another setting , say @xmath15 and the same @xmath82 . as we have explained in more detail previously @xcite ,",
    "it is permissible to ask the question of what would have been obtained if the measurement had been performed with a different setting .",
    "it is also permissible to hypothesize the existence of an element of reality related to that different setting if that different setting had been chosen .",
    "however , to assume then , as is always done in bell type proofs , that all these possible different measurement results are actually contained in the data set of actual outcomes of the idealized experiment is arbitrary and against all the rules of modelling and simulation especially for the particular case of the aspect - type experiment and all other known epr experiments @xcite .",
    "naturally , we do not have to pay for all items on a restaurant s menu just because we could have chosen them .",
    "we call this latter assumption the extended counterfactual assumption ( eca ) .",
    "eca is equivalent to the assumption that @xmath30 and @xmath13 only depend on one random variable @xmath9 and is therefore an assumption , not a proof . as a consequence",
    ", eca implies that @xmath30 and @xmath13 are defined on one common probability space . in view of the bass - vorobev theorem it leads to a contradiction from the outset irrespective and independent of any physical considerations",
    "a number of physical conditions have been given in the past that have been thought to be necessary and sufficient for the bell inequalities to be valid .",
    "most prominently among these conditions ranks the definition of an objective local parameter space @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this definition involves several conditions that are automatically fulfilled in our kolmogorovian model as has been outlined before @xcite ; it further implies the existence of elements of reality that contain information related to the spin ( represented by the random variable @xmath9 ) and , most importantly einstein locality .",
    "armed with the knowledge that the validity of the bell inequalities as described above is equivalent to the assumption that @xmath38 can be defined on one common probability space , we must now ask the question how this fact can be related to the condition of an objective local parameter space i.e. essentially to einstein locality and the existence of elements of reality .",
    "we first deal with the question of the relation between the elements of reality that are  carried \" by the correlated spin pair and the elements @xmath0 of a probability space .",
    "part of the work around the bell theorem concentrates on the question whether elements of reality that determine ( or at least co - determine ) the outcome of the spin measurement can exist .",
    "is not @xmath0 such an element of reality and do we not assume then its existence to start with ?",
    "the answer is that the @xmath0 s represent only a necessary tool to count and average all measurements correctly . whether or not the outcome of a single measurement is the causal consequence of an element of reality is , at this point , not discussed .",
    "the symbol @xmath0 represents just the choice of the goddess tyche ( fortuna ) for the given experiment .",
    "of course , if an element of reality exists , @xmath0 can just represent this element .",
    "the question of whether such elements of reality can exist in nature and do explain the epr experiments was , of course , a subject of the einstein - bohr debate and is also subject of our discussion here . to explore this question using the bell inequalities",
    "we need to explore whether there exist physical reasons that demand the definition of @xmath38 on one probability space .",
    "a very important and broadly applicable physical reason for the definition of @xmath38 on one common probability space arises for the case in which all random variables are characterized only by the information emanating from a common source .",
    "if in addition this information is stochastically independent of the settings ( delayed choice arguments ) , then in line with our notational convention @xmath38 are completely determined by one random variable @xmath9 corresponding to the elements of reality @xmath82 .",
    "these elements of reality can be viewed as the value the random variable @xmath9 assumes for the experiment that we denoted by @xmath0 i.e. we have the relation @xmath83 .",
    "the settings may , of course , also be treated as random variables and may be defined on a separate probability space . however , because @xmath9 and the settings are stochastically independent , all random variables can be defined on one common probability space namely the product space .",
    "we have discussed details of these facts in @xcite . under these conditions",
    "the bell inequalities will hold and the mathematical model obeying these conditions is in contradiction to quantum mechanics .",
    "we will show in the next section how this contradiction can be resolved by still using a classical space - time framework and just adding time and setting dependent equipment random variables in addition to the source random variable @xmath9 .",
    "we would like to emphasize , however , that even though the system consisting of source parameters only correctly can be ruled out , this fact does not necessarily have anything to do with einstein locality .",
    "for example , we can introduce a source parameter represented by a random variable @xmath84 that operates only if the settings @xmath85 and @xmath21 are employed and @xmath84  knows \" of these settings by action at a distance .",
    "similarly we admit a completely different source parameter @xmath86 that operates and operates only if the three different settings @xmath87 and @xmath88 are going to be chosen . again",
    "@xmath86  knows \" of these settings @xmath89 , @xmath88 by action at a distance .",
    "as long as @xmath84 is a random variable defined on some probability space and @xmath86 is a random variable defined on some possibly different probability space , the bell inequalities formed as before for the settings @xmath85 , @xmath21 respectively for @xmath89,@xmath88 are valid in spite of the assumption of action at a distance .",
    "thus a contradiction exists between the results of quantum mechanics and the physical assumptions that have just been described and that appear , on the surface , to be very general .",
    "this contradiction has therefore been explained by some authors invoking violations of einstein locality @xcite .",
    "others have given more reasonable , albeit noncommittal , explanations by postulating that ( i ) the elements of reality simply do not exist and/or ( ii ) there exists a  contextuality \" as discussed in @xcite .",
    "different contexts of measurements provide then different probability spaces .",
    "there were also other choices to explain the difficult situation such as ( iii ) counterfactual reasoning was held responsible for the difficulties @xcite . as we have shown , no counterfactual reasoning is necessary to derive the inequalities and the extended counterfactual reasoning ( eca ) described above is flawed from the viewpoint of mathematical modelling .",
    "we will show in the next section that explanations ( i ) and ( ii ) can , in principle , be reformulated in such a way as to have a natural explanation in the space - time of relativity .",
    "we note that ( i ) and ( ii ) contain in essence bohr s interpretation : the spin is determined in the moment of measurement and , with respect to measurements in any of the two wings of the experiment , there is essentially the question of  an influence on the very conditions which define the possible types of prediction ... \" @xcite .      as the basis for our reasoning in this section",
    ", we will assume or postulate certain properties for the parameters and random variables of the probability theory that are in harmony with special relativity .",
    "we define with each basic experiment that corresponds to an element @xmath0 of the probability space a pair of light - cones corresponding to locations and time at which the experiments are performed as shown in fig [ fig : lightcones ] .",
    "the elements of reality and the corresponding random variables of the mathematical model are permitted to be functions of the space - time coordinates of the respective light - cones . as parameter random variables we admit not only source parameters but also equipment parameters for each measurement station .",
    "what we introduce below is a dependence of the equipment parameters of a given station on the setting vector in the light - cone of that station and an additional dependence on the time of measurement of a clock in the inertial frame of the equipment .",
    "all we need to achieve is to derive a model for ma - epr within the space - time of relativity that is not refuted by bell - type inequalities and agrees with ( i ) and ( ii ) in spirit ( if not the letter ) .",
    "for this it is only necessary to find an einstein local model with random variables @xmath38 that can not be defined on one common probability space . to show that this is possible we revert to the standard notation using the settings as subscripts and denoting the functions in the two experimental wings by @xmath90 on one side and @xmath91 on the other .",
    "we continue to permit all functions to be functions of a source parameter @xmath9 which may have a time dependence e.g. @xmath9 may depend on the time of emission of the correlated pair . however , we also add equipment random variables . of course ,",
    "equipment parameters have been discussed before in many research articles . but none of them considered the role of time dependencies of these equipment parameters except our work ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we permit that the probability densities of these additional random variables depend on the time of measurement @xmath92 as shown by a local clock and also to depend on the local setting .",
    "we indicate this latter fact by denoting the additional random variable e.g. for setting @xmath11 by @xmath93 we then have @xmath94 and similar for the other settings and the @xmath12 s on the other side e.g. @xmath95 .",
    "notice that all light - cones for different measurement times may contain different @xmath93 even though the setting is the same .",
    "no matter how a probabilistic model is conceived , different light - cones can certainly support different probability distributions for the elements of reality .",
    "assume now that as in the aspect - type experiment the settings on each side are sequentially changed . because according to relativity this change of settings to take place requires a time interval of length bounded away from 0 by a positive constant @xmath96 , all light - cone pairs of a sequence of measurements are different and each such experiment may be on a different probability space with a different density of the involved random variables .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath97 be an element of a probability space that determines the random times of measurement i.e. @xmath98 is the actual measurement time of a given experiment . we now show that physical reasons , derived from the framework of relativity only , necessitate the involvement of different probability spaces if one postulates the existence of time and setting dependent einstein local equipment parameters .",
    "theorem2 : assume that there exist a source parameter @xmath9 and equipment parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 such that @xmath99 and @xmath100 not only depend on the setting vectors @xmath101 and @xmath21 , respectively , but also on the time @xmath92 of a given measurement . here",
    "we consider @xmath92 to be a random variable @xmath102 .",
    "thus @xmath103 the source parameter @xmath104 is permitted to depend on emission time .",
    "we assume further that the random variables corresponding to the measurements of spin @xmath105 and @xmath106 all equal to @xmath26 are functions of the source parameter and of the equipment parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "then , under the assumption that the velocity of light in vacuo is an upper limit for the velocities by which the settings can be changed , there is no probability space on which all of @xmath107 @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 can be consistently defined .",
    "proof : let @xmath111 be any time interval of length @xmath112 .",
    "let @xmath113 be a measurable set in the range of @xmath9 and let @xmath114 and @xmath115 be sets in the ranges of @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath100 respectively",
    ". then @xmath118 \\label{bvcc13}\\ ] ] is the impossible event and therefore has probability 0 .",
    "recall that @xmath0 signifies the sending out of a particular particle pair from the source .",
    "this result simply reflects the impossibility in the space - time of relativity to accomplish two different settings on both sides within the same short time interval and all for the same @xmath0 .",
    "hence for each time interval @xmath111",
    "each of the sixteen probabilities @xmath119 = 0 \\label{bvcc15}\\ ] ] must vanish . here",
    "@xmath120 denotes the dependence on source and equipment parameters that in turn depend on @xmath0 and @xmath97 respectively just as in eq.([ccc2 ] ) .",
    "now let @xmath121 be a finite but arbitrarily long time interval .",
    "then @xmath121 can be split up into a large but finite number @xmath122 of intervals @xmath123 with length @xmath124 .",
    "then the probability in eq.([bvcc15 ] ) with @xmath111 replaced by @xmath121 also must vanish because of finite additivity and thus @xmath125 and @xmath106 can not be defined on a common probability space as claimed .",
    "in other words , not only must we have different probability spaces involved in the aspect - type experiment for mathematical reasons , we must have different probability spaces for physical reasons , the requirements of relativity .",
    "we emphasize that none of the assumptions in the above proof imply any synchronization of the measurement times with certain settings .",
    "both settings and measurement times can be chosen randomly , only the measurement times in @xmath14 and @xmath16 are correlated for any given photon pair .",
    "note that the essence of bohr s discussion is not violated by the above .",
    "we just need to view both spin and measurement equipment in the sense of information theory : the measurement outcome is really not the single consequence of the source information @xmath82 that characterizes particle properties but also that of the measurement equipment and the corresponding @xmath126 etc .. these equipment parameters correspond to the use of decoding machines in information theory @xcite .",
    "both the source information content together with that of the decoding machines or equipment parameters ( that involve different probability spaces ) determine the measurement outcomes i.e. the values @xmath26 that the functions @xmath127 etc .",
    "in a larger sense this fulfills the spirit of bohr .",
    "the spin does not really exist before the measurement , but only in the very moment of measurement is the outcome determined ( decoded ) and can not be separated from the equipment and act of measurement . the contextuality is implicitly contained in the dependence of the probability densities of the various variables on measurement time .",
    "for example , it is now incorrect to say that it makes no difference if one measures with setting @xmath15 or setting @xmath21 on the other side .",
    "it does make a difference because one necessarily makes these different measurements during different time intervals .",
    "the measurements in both wings are also performed at the same clock - time or at least at correlated clock - times which opens the possibility of correlations between the two wings even though the settings are randomly chosen .",
    "what is the meaning then of the aspect et al .",
    "@xcite experiment in view of the above discussions ? if one assumes that this experiment is free from any problems related to non - ideal experimental conditions and if one assumes that a space - time explanation must be possible then the aspect et al .",
    "experiment has proven the existence of setting and time dependent equipment parameters .",
    "we have shown that the inequalities of bell can be derived as special cases of a more general theorem found by bass ten years earlier .",
    "we have further shown that the bell inequalities are valid if and only if the three random variables involved can actually be defined on a common probability space . as a consequence",
    "the bell theorem is correct at least for the following systems of hidden variables , in the sense that these systems can be ruled out :    1 .",
    "source parameter @xmath9 only , 2 .",
    "source parameter @xmath9 and equipment parameters @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath100 that depend only on the respective settings .    on the other hand , equipment parameters that depend on the measurement times as well as on the respective instrument settings can not be ruled out .",
    "a space - time explanation of the aspect et al .",
    "experiment is therefore not ruled out by bell s inequalities .",
    "any such space - time explanation can not rely on source parameters only but must involve a certain type of time and setting dependent equipment parameter random variables .",
    "thus , the validity of the bell inequalities for objective local parameter spaces has not been proven by any of the proofs reported in the literature @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the authors would like to thank m. aschwanden for creating the figures of the manuscript and helpful suggestions .",
