    "the correlation between the mass of the supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies and the bulge stellar mass or the velocity dispersion strongly suggest that the growth of the central supermassive black hole and the evolution of the galaxies are connected .",
    "obscured active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are important targets for studying the agn - galaxy coevolution because a large number of host galaxies can be investigated in detail being free from the strong central emission from the agn itself .",
    "moreover , they are of special importance because some types of obscured agns such as the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) have long been anticipated to be in the middle of the evolutionary sequence of agns .",
    "the `` new type agns '' recently found by @xcite , where the central engine is thought to be deeply obscured by a dust torus with an unusually small opening angle , are also interesting for its nature and role in the agn evolution .",
    "consequently , measuring the black hole mass in obscured agns is important ; however , the precise measurement is not straightforward .",
    "the position - velocity diagram of the molecular disk surrounding the black hole , obtained by the vlbi observation of the h@xmath5o maser , is considered to be one of the most precise estimate for the black hole mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , precise alignment between the equatorial plane of the molecular disk and the observer s line of sight is required for the disk h@xmath5o maser to be observable ; thus the number of applicable targets is very limited . the single - epoch mass estimate based on the luminosity scaling relation of the broad emission - line region ( blr ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) measuring the widths of the polarized broad balmer emission lines would be widely available for type-2 agns .",
    "however , a significant fraction of type-2 agns does not present the polarized broad balmer emission lines @xcite .",
    "moreover , this type of measurement might be unavailable for the ulirgs and the new - type agns , whose blr is largely covered by obscuring materials .",
    "a precise estimate of the black hole mass that is widely available for obscured agns is desired .",
    "the fluorescent iron k@xmath0 line ( hereafter , fek@xmath0 line ) is an almost ubiquitous emission line observable for both obscured and unobscured agns @xcite . the rest - frame energy of the narrow core of the fek@xmath0 emission line is close to that of neutral or low - ionization - state irons .",
    "considering its narrow line width , the emitting region is supposed to be not very close to the black hole , such as the outer parts of the accretion disk and more distant matter .",
    "the large equivalent width indicates both large covering fraction and large optical depth for the emitting region , which suggests that the neutral fek@xmath0 line core originates in the dust torus surrounding the central engine in accordance with the unified model of agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when the width of an emission line and the distance of its emitting region from the black hole are obtained , the black hole mass can be estimated assuming the virial relation . @xcite",
    "assumed that the location of the emitting region of the neutral fek@xmath0 line core corresponds to the near - infrared @xmath10-band reverberation radius for the inner region of the dust torus , and estimated the black hole mass of 10 type-1 agns on the basis of the fek@xmath0 line widths and the luminosity scaling relation of the dust reverberation radius to the optical @xmath11-band luminosity by @xcite .",
    "they examined the black hole mass on the basis of the neutral fek@xmath0 line core by comparing the black hole mass obtained from the broad emission - line reverberation ; however , the correlation between them was statistically insignificant , which could be attributable to small sample size and large uncertainties in the fek@xmath0 line widths .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite presented the luminosity scaling relations of the broad h@xmath1 emission - line reverberation radius and the dust reverberation radius to isotropic luminosity indicators that are unbiased by the obscuration , such as the luminosity of the [ ] @xmath12 m emission line @xmath13}}$ ] , and that of the _ swift _ bat hard x - ray ( 14195 kev ) band @xmath14 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using these radius - luminosity scaling relations , it becomes possible to derive the radius of the emitting region of the neutral fek@xmath0 line core for obscured agns .    in this paper , we estimate the black hole mass of both obscured and unobscured agns on the basis of the line width of the neutral fek@xmath0 line core and the luminosity scaling relation of its emitting region radius with the [ ] @xmath12 m emission - line luminosity .",
    "then , the estimated black hole mass was examined by comparing them with other black hole mass estimates that have been established .",

    "in addition , @xmath2 and @xmath6 are well correlated and show an approximately proportional relationship , since the slope of the best - fit linear regression is positive more than @xmath47 uncertainties and close to unity .",

    "the best - fit linear regression is estimated as @xmath51 which indicates that @xmath2 is systematically larger than @xmath4 by about a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "we note that @xmath6 is also larger than @xmath4 by a similar factor for the three targets , ngc 1068 , ngc 4388 , and circinus , for which both @xmath4 and @xmath6 are estimated .    to summarize the results , @xmath2 is consistent with @xmath3 for most of the type-1 agns and with @xmath6 for all of the type-2 agns .",
    "@xmath2 is correlated well with @xmath6 and @xmath4 for the type-2 agns , although @xmath4 is a systematic smaller than the others .",

    "the systematic difference of @xmath4 implies an ambiguous issue .",
    "since @xmath4 is considered to be the most precise estimate for the black hole mass , then , through the relations of @xmath4 with @xmath2 and @xmath6 , another reliable estimate @xmath3 is suspected to considerably overestimate the black hole mass that is difficult to be accounted for by the uncertainties in the virial factor @xmath32 ( @xmath52 in this paper and presented by onken et al .",
    "2004 ; @xmath53 by woo et al . 2010",
    "; @xmath54 by graham et al .",
    "2011 ; @xmath55 by grier et al . 2013 ) . in this section , the systematic differences between those black hole mass estimates and the possible origins of these differences are discussed .",
    "in fact , the systematic difference between @xmath6 and @xmath4 has been indicated by preceding studies . @xcite",
    "measured the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath56 in the centers of the galaxies hosting type-2 agns whose @xmath4 was obtained , and found that @xmath4 tended to be smaller than the black hole mass that was estimated from @xmath56 and the @xmath57@xmath56 relation of local elliptical galaxies . on the other hand , estimated the radius of the blr from the [ ] luminosity via the luminosity scaling relation of the blr to estimate @xmath6 of 12 type-2 agns , and found that @xmath6 tended to be larger than the black hole mass that was estimated from @xmath56 via the @xmath57@xmath56 relation . according to these results , @xmath6 would be systematically larger than @xmath4 , as is the case in this study .",
    "recently , @xcite presented that the virial factor @xmath32 of the reverberation - mapped agn is systematically different between two bulge types of the host galaxies , as @xmath58 for classical bulges and ellipticals , and @xmath59 for psuedobulges .",
    "in fact , the black hole mass of the agns with psuedobulges tends to be smaller than that with classical bulges and ellipticals as shown in their figure 2 .",
    "@xcite also argued that the mass of the black hole hosted by later - type and lower - mass galaxies tended to be less massive with larger scatter than that estimated from the @xmath57@xmath56 relation for the elliptical galaxies .",
    "since our type-2 agn targets with the h@xmath5o maser observation tend to have a less massive black hole than the others if @xmath4 is correct , then , it is possible that the systematic difference of the target selection partly contributes to the systematic difference between @xmath4 and the other black hole mass indicators .",
    "contrary to these studies , @xcite estimated the radius of the blr from the absorption - corrected luminosity in the 210 kev x - ray band @xmath60 via the luminosity scaling relation of the blr to estimate @xmath6 of 4 type-2 agns whose @xmath4 was obtained by them , and presented that @xmath4 and @xmath6 were consistent with each other .",
    "in fact , the three targets , ngc 1068 , ngc 4388 , and circinus , for which the large systematic difference between @xmath6 and @xmath4 is presented in this paper , are included in the targets of @xcite .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy between these studies is uncertain , but a difficulty in estimating the luminosity of the central engine @xmath60 for most of the targets with very large x - ray absorbing column density could be suspected , although it was estimated with particular attention .",
    "assuming both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are reliable estimates for the black hole mass , @xmath2 and @xmath6 are considered to overestimate the black hole mass in type-2 agns .",
    "the systematically larger @xmath2 for the type-2 agns implies that the width of the neutral fek@xmath0 line core is systematically larger for the large inclination angle for type-2 agns .",
    "if the emitting region of the neutral fek@xmath0 line core shows an equatorial motion , then the virial factor @xmath32 in equation ( [ eqn_virial ] ) decreases as the inclination angle increases .",
    "for example , @xmath61 at the edge - on view , which is smaller than @xmath34 for type-1 agns , is derived assuming an equatorial circular motion . however , it is not so small as to account for the difference of about a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "outflow motions toward the equatorial plane might broaden the width of the neutral fek@xmath0 line core for type-2 agns .    on the other hand , the systematically larger @xmath6 for the type-2 agns",
    "can not be attributed to the inclination of agns from the point of view of the unified model of agns ; when the broad emission line is scattered to the observer at the polar region well above the height of the dust torus , the viewing angle of the blr from the scattering region would be similar to that from the observer for type-1 agns .",
    "non - virial motions such as outflows in the scattering region are possible to be contributed , as @xcite proposed to explain the broad h@xmath0 emission line in the polarized spectrum of the quasar pg 1700@xmath62518 .",
    "however , a common or closely related mechanism to broaden the widths of both of the neutral fek@xmath0 line core and the polarized broad balmer emission lines systematically for type-2 agns is required to explain the approximate agreement between @xmath2 and @xmath6 .",
    "as described in section 3 , the fwhm of the neutral fek@xmath0 line core falls between the fwhm of the broad balmer emission lines and the corresponding values at the dust reverberation radius in most cases , which indicates that the emitting region of its major fraction is located between the outer blr and the inner dust torus .",
    "it is suggested by previous studies for some of the target agns . for ngc 4151 ,",
    "@xcite compared the variation of the continuum and the excess flux around the neutral fek@xmath0 line and presented that the emitting region of the excess flux has an extent of @xmath63 cm , or 40 light days , which is consistent with or slightly smaller than the dust reverberation radius @xcite . for ngc 5548",
    ", @xcite reported that the emitting region of the neutral fek@xmath0 line was located between the two reverberation radii of the broad h@xmath1 emission line and the near - infrared dust emission based on its flux variation and line width .",
    "the blr and the dust torus are considered not to be decoupled from each other but to constitute a continuous structure , and the transition zone of the blr and the dust torus would be located between the two reverberation radii @xcite . in addition , recent reverberation observations of the optical emission lines presented that its reverberation radius was comparable to or at most twice that of the broad h@xmath1 emission line @xcite , which shows the presence of low ionization iron atoms there .",
    "if the fek@xmath0 emitting region constitutes a tight stratified structure with the blr and the dust torus , a good correlation between the fwhms of the neutral fek@xmath0 line and the broad balmer emission lines is expected .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ fwhm_fwhm ] , there appears no clear correlation between them as has been reported by previous studies @xcite . a simple explanation for it would be that the neutral fek@xmath19 line is produced in different origins such as the outer accretion disk , the blr , and the innermost dust torus , and the mixing ratio is different from target to target . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite suggested that the neutral fek@xmath19 line may originate from a universal region at the same radius with respect to the gravitational radius of the central black hole , because its fwhm is almost constant and independent of the black hole mass . in any case , those uncertainties will result in the possible error of the black hole mass estimated from the neutral fek@xmath19 line .    in this study",
    ", we used the best spectral resolution data currently available , but the spectral resolution and sensitivity are still limited . as a result , the number of the targets is small and the relatively large uncertainties remain in the fwhm data , which would make it difficult to examine the location of the neutral fek@xmath19 line emitting region in more detail . in the near future",
    ", the substantial progress is expected by the _ astro - h _ x - ray satellite @xcite , which is capable of unprecedented energy - resolution spectroscopy with superior sensitivity at fek@xmath0 band .",
    "it will enable us to study more detail on the origin of the neutral fek@xmath0 line core by examining the line profile of the neutral fek@xmath0 line and its time variation , then it will become able to measure the black hole mass with improved accuracy for a large number of obscured agns .",
    "the hard x - ray luminosity with precise absorption correction is obviously valuable for the isotropic luminosity indicator because the scaling relations of the reverberation radii to the hard x - ray luminosity are tighter than to the [ ] luminosity @xcite .",
