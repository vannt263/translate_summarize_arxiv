    "this holographic model undergoes a phase transition from black hole with no hair ( normal phase / conductor phase ) to the case with scalar hair at low temperatures ( superconducting phase ) .",
    "holographic d - wave model was constructed by introducing a charged massive spin two field propagating in the bulk  @xcite . to realize a holographic p - wave superconductor model",
    ", one needs to introduce a charged vector field in the bulk as a vector order parameter . ref .",
    "@xcite presented a holographic p - wave model by introducing a su(2 ) yang - mills field into the bulk , where a gauge boson generated by one su(2 ) generator is dual to the vector order parameter .",
    "other generalized studies based on this model can be found for example in refs .",
    "an alternative holographic realization of p - wave superconductivity emerges from the condensation of a 2-form field in the bulk  @xcite .    in a recent paper  @xcite",
    ", we have studied a holographic model by introducing a complex vector field @xmath0 charged under a maxwell gauge field @xmath1 in the bulk , which is dual to a strongly coupled system involving a charged vector operator with a global u(1 ) symmetry . in this model",
    "there exists a non - minimal coupling between the vector field and the gauge field characterizing the magnetic moment of the vector field , which plays a crucial role in the condensate of the vector field induced by an applied magnetic field .",
    "we have studied this model in the probe limit at finite density .",
    "such a setup meets the minimum requirement to construct a holographic p - wave superconductor model .",
    "indeed , we have found a critical temperature at which the system undergoes a second order phase transition .",
    "the critical exponent of this transition is one half which coincides with the case in the landau - ginzburg theory . in the condensed phase ,",
    "a vector operator acquires a vacuum expectation value breaking the u(1 ) symmetry as well as rotational symmetry spontaneously .",

    ", we need to go beyond the probe approximation and to include the back reaction . while the previous paper  @xcite focused on the effects of the non - minimal coupling term and applied magnetic field on the condensate of the vector operator , in this paper we aim at studying the effect of the back reaction of the matter fields on the background geometry .",
    "we will turn off the non - minimal coupling between the vector field @xmath0 and the gauge field @xmath1 since we do not discuss magnetic effect in this paper .",

    "the thermodynamic behavior of the model has a dramatic change from large @xmath6 to small @xmath6 . in the case with large @xmath6 , if one lowers the temperature , the normal phase will become unstable to developing vector hair below a critical temperature @xmath7 .",
    "the transition from the normal phase to the condensed phase is second order for larger @xmath2 , i.e. , weak strength of the back reaction .",
    "however , as we decrease @xmath2 to a critical one , the phase transition becomes first order . on the other hand , for the case with small @xmath6 ,",
    "no matter the value of @xmath2 , there exists a temperature below which the condensed phase never exists .",
    "when the back reaction is weak , hairy solutions dominate the phase diagram below a critical temperature @xmath8 through a second order transition , then the condensed phase terminates at a lower temperature @xmath9 at which its free energy jumps to the one in the normal phase , indicating a zeroth order transition . as we strengthen the back reaction , we first encounter for a first order transition at temperature @xmath10 and then a zeroth order transition at @xmath9 . for the sufficiently strong back reaction case",
    ", the condensed phase only occurs at a high temperature @xmath11 rather than at a low temperature .",

    "since we only consider the case without external magnetic field , this term will not play any role .",

    "more precisely , we hope that this system would admit hairy black hole solutions at low temperatures , but no hair at high temperatures .",
    "thus , the condensate of the dual vector operator will break the u(1 ) symmetry as well as the spatial rotational symmetry since the condensate will pick out one direction as special .",
    "therefore , viewing this vector field as an order parameter , the holographic model can be used to mimic a p - wave superconductor ( superfluid ) phase transition .",
    "this turns out to be true in the probe limit  @xcite : when one lowers the temperature to a certain value , the normal background becomes unstable and a nontrivial vector hair @xmath23 appears . in this paper",
    ", we continue to study this model by considering the back reaction of matter fields on the background geometry .",
    "to construct homogeneous charged black hole solutions with vector hair , we adopt the following ansatz @xmath24 we will denote the position of the horizon as @xmath25 and the conformal boundary will be at @xmath26 . our consideration is as follows .",
    "since we would like to study a dual theory with finite chemical potential or charge density accompanied by a u(1 ) symmetry , we turn on @xmath27 in the bulk .",
    "we want to allow for states with a non - trivial current @xmath28 , for which we further introduce @xmath23 in the bulk . because a non - vanishing @xmath28 picks out @xmath29 direction as special , which obviously breaks the rotational symmetry in @xmath30 plane .",
    "therefore we introduce a function @xmath31 in the @xmath32 component of the metric in order to describe the anisotropy .",

    "therefore , we have to solve them numerically .",
    "we will use shooting method to solve equations  . in order to find the solutions for all the five functions @xmath41 one must impose suitable boundary conditions at both conformal boundary @xmath26 and the horizon @xmath42 .    in order to match the asymptotical ads boundary",

    "we are interested in black hole configurations that have a regular event horizon located at @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , in addition to @xmath33 , one must require @xmath53 in order for @xmath54 being finite at the horizon .",
    "we require the regularity conditions at the horizon @xmath42 , which means that all our functions have finite values and admit a series expansion in terms of @xmath55 as @xmath56 by plugging the expansion   into  , one can find that there are five independent parameters at the horizon @xmath57 .",

    ". since there does not exist any particular temperature at which the condensate terminates and turns around to high temperatures in the su(2 ) p - wave case , it is natural to expect that the result is also true in our model with @xmath142 .",
    "indeed , for the special case @xmath142 , if we ignore the possible turning point @xmath9 at very low temperature , the model exhibits extremely similar behavior as the su(2 ) p - wave model  @xcite .",

    "in contrast , this term for @xmath147 is regular as @xmath26 .",
    "similar to the case in the s - wave model  @xcite , we may have freedom to consider @xmath144 either as source term or expectation value of the dual operator .",
    "the critical value of mass square is @xmath142 .",
    "thus , it is not surprised that the model exhibits distinguished behaviors for @xmath147 and @xmath145 numerically .",
    "one may suspect that even for very large @xmath6 there exists a non zero but very small minimal temperature like @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , we can not rule out this possibility by numerical approach only .",
    "nonetheless , for large @xmath93 , our numerical calculation indicates that the physical branch of @xmath28 ( @xmath50 and @xmath35 ) versus temperature may behave well up to zero temperature .",
    "in particular , we do not find any evidence of the branch turning back to a one at higher temperature as a characteristic of a zeroth order transition shown , for example , in figure  [ condfreea ] .   and",
    "we manage to solve the coupled equations of motion   up to the temperature as low as @xmath149 and find no evidence of the condensate turning around to a branch extending to the high temperature region .",
    "] of course it is helpful to clear up this issue by constructing the extremal limit of the hairy black hole solutions . we leave this for future investigation .",
    "we draw the plot of the critical temperature versus the mass of the vector field from the normal phase to the condensed phase in figure  [ masstempe ] .",
    "one can see that the critical temperature decreases with the mass of @xmath0 at a given @xmath2 .",
    "this behavior is also observed in holographic models involving a charged scalar field  @xcite .",
    "we did not find any hint in the probe limit that the condensate as well as other quantities turns back to a branch extending to the high temperature region at a certain temperature like @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the appearance of @xmath9 is the consequence of the back reaction . for sufficiently large @xmath2 , the back reaction can be ignored and we should recover the results in the probe limit .",
    "in other words , @xmath9 should be zero and the critical temperatures @xmath7 and @xmath8 should arrive at some finite constants as @xmath150 .",
    "however , one can see from figure  [ phasediagn ] that the value of @xmath9 increases with @xmath2 , and from figure  [ phasediagp ] and figure  [ phasediagn ] that the critical temperatures @xmath7 and @xmath8 from the normal phase to the condensed phase also increase with large @xmath2 linearly .",
    "this is seemingly inconsistent with the expectation in the probe limit .",
    "in fact our numerical results are consistent with the probe limit .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "note that the probe limit demands that one takes the limit @xmath150 , while keeping @xmath3 and @xmath151 fixed in our model . to compare our results to the ones in the probe limit",
    ", we should make the scaling transformation @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "under such a transformation , the chemical potential @xmath49 becomes @xmath154 and the temperature @xmath12 changes to @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , it is the value @xmath155 that corresponds to the temperature in the probe limit . indeed , in our numerical calculations , we checked that @xmath156 and the critical temperatures @xmath157 and @xmath158 approach to some constants as @xmath150 .",
    "therefore our numerical results are in agreement with the probe limit analysis .    furthermore , we know from from ( [ stresstensor ] ) that to see whether the dual stress - energy tensor is isotropic or not , we have to extract the value of @xmath159 carefully in our calculations .",
    "we find that the numerical solutions presented in our paper have @xmath160 up to a numerical error ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "it means that although the model has an anisotropic structure associated with the p - wave order with non - vanishing @xmath28 in the condensed phase , the stress - energy tensor is isotropic .",
    "this is the same as in the su(2 ) p - wave model case   appearing in equation ( 21 ) of ref .",
    "it has been confirmed that the value of @xmath162 should be vanishing up to a reasonable numerical error  @xcite . ] and is consistent with the arguments presented in ref .",
    "in this paper we studied a holographic p - wave superconductor model in a four dimensional einstein - maxwell - complex vector field theory with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the complex vector field @xmath0 is charged under the maxwell field .",
    "taking the back reaction of matter fields into consideration , we managed to construct hairy black hole solutions which satisfy all asymptotic conditions .",
    "we found the model presents a rich phase structure controlled by the mass @xmath5 and charge @xmath2 of the vector field @xmath0 .",
    "we investigated possible phase transitions in detail .",
    "it turns out that there exist zeroth order , first order and second order phase transitions in this model .",
    "hairy black holes were also found in the unusual higher temperature range @xmath11 , which always have free energy higher than the normal phase .",
    "the phase diagrams in terms of the temperature and charge were constructed .",
    "our numerical calculation suggests the existence of a critical @xmath6 denoted as @xmath96 .",
    "when @xmath93 , we have a second order phase transition from the normal phase to the condensed phase for the weak back reaction case .",
    "this transition becomes a first order one as we increase the strength of the back reaction .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath7 decreases as we decrease the value of @xmath2 , which means that the increase of the back reaction makes the transition more difficult . when @xmath95 , the thermodynamic behavior of the system changes a lot .",
    "starting from the high temperature region , one can find the following transitions : for @xmath119 , the system undergoes a second order phase transition from the normal phase to the condensed phase at @xmath8 and as the temperature decreases to @xmath9 , there is a zeroth order transition back to the normal phase ; for @xmath120 , the system first undergoes a first order phase transition from the normal phase to the condensed phase at @xmath10 , then at the lower temperature @xmath9 , it comes back to the normal phase by a zeroth order transition ; for @xmath121 , we can only get hairy black hole solutions that are always subdominant in the free energy referred to as  retrograde condensation \" . here",
    "the concrete values of @xmath163 and @xmath164 depend on the mass squared @xmath6 of the vector field @xmath165 .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the holographic free energy can be thought of as a sort of generalized version of landau - ginzburg free energy . in landau - ginzburg theory",
    ", it is usually assumed that the quadratic term depends on the temperature linearly while the fourth order term is not strongly temperature dependent . in our present study , we found the behaviors deviating from the mean field theory . in the context of landau - ginzburg theory ,",
    "such deviation would be a sign of an unusual temperature dependence of the higher order terms .",
    "it should be stressed that our model is dual to a strongly coupled system . a priori the dual system does not obey the usual assumption for the free energy .",
    "it is in principle possible that there is some new temperature scale at which the coefficients of higher order terms change their signs , giving rise to non - standard phase transitions in the framework of landau - ginzburg theory",
    ".    our study can be straightforwardly generalized to the higher dimensional case and other gravitational backgrounds , such as the ads soliton backgrounds which can mimic the superconductor / insulator phase transition  @xcite .",
    "in a recent paper  @xcite , we studied the effect of an applied magnetic field effect on the ads soliton background , and found that the magnetic field can induce the ads soliton instability due to the non - minimal coupling of the vector field and the background magnetic field . by comparing our complex vector field model to the su(2 ) p - wave model with a constant non - abelian magnetic field",
    ", we found that the su(2 ) p - wave model can be recovered by the restriction @xmath142 and @xmath166 in our model with the ansatz in ref .",

    ", we can see in this paper that our model shows a much richer phase structure than the su(2 ) p - wave model , thus can be used to describe more phenomena in dual strongly coupled systems .    in the present paper , we limited ourselves to a simple case with @xmath23 non - vanishing only . in principle , in order to understand the full phase structure of the model at fixed chemical potential",
    ", one should search for the dominant thermodynamic configuration not only in this given sector but in a more general setup , especially turning on the temporal component of the charged vector @xmath168 .",
    "this would of course be much more involved , since one should search for the hairy black hole configuration with the least free energy among all possible configurations .",
    "we will leave this issue for further study .    as a phenomenological approach",
    ", we consider the model as a p - wave superconducting ( superfluid ) one .",
    "indeed , this toy model could be applicable in a wide variety of condensed matter systems and beyond . indeed , as we have discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it may also be revelent for holographically mimicking the phenomenon that the qcd vacuum undergoes a phase transition to an exotic phase with charged @xmath50-meson condensed in a sufficiently strong magnetic field  @xcite .    as we have mentioned above , according to the symmetry of the macroscopic wave function or condensate of cooper pairs in the real superconducting materials",
    ", the superconductor can be classified by s - wave , p - wave , d - wave and so on .",
    "the holographic s - wave model has well studied ( especially with back reaction ) in the literature . adopting the present p - wave model ,",
