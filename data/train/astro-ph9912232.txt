    "the total radio emission of a galaxy consists of different components : the thermal radio emission , @xmath1 , representing bremsstrahlung from @xmath2 regions and the nonthermal radio emission which is synchrotron emission from cosmic ray electrons ( cres ) .",
    "as far as the nonthermal radio emission , @xmath3 , is concerned , a further division can be made by distinguishing between the diffuse radio emission , @xmath4 , from cres that are spread over the galactic disks and halos and the emission from discrete supernova remnants ( snrs ) , @xmath5 .",
    "the three components possess very different spectral indices : whereas the thermal radio emission has a flat spectral index ( @xmath6 ) , the nonthermal radio spectrum is steeper .",
    "the spectral index of snrs is on average @xmath7 ( green @xcite ) and the diffuse radio emission can have , depending on the dominant process for the cr propagation , spectral indiceshere and in the following we define the spectral index @xmath8 as @xmath9 , @xmath8 , between about @xmath10 and @xmath11 which can , additionally , vary over the frequency range",
    ". therefore , the total radio spectral index depends very sensitively on the relative contribution of the different components .",
    "the spectrum of the diffuse synchrotron emission is shaped by the physical processes that are characterizing the cr propagation , in particular the type of propagation ( diffusion or convection ) , of energy losses ( synchrotron , inverse compton , adiabatic losses or bremsstrahlung ) , and the confinement of cres .",
    "here , we consider cres confined to a galaxy if they loose their energy through combined synchrotron and inverse compton losses , down below the energy level corresponding to the observing frequency , before they are able to leave the galactic halo .",
    "the question whether cres are confined to galaxies or can escape from the halos without suffering considerable energy losses is important for the interpretation of the far - infrared ( fir)/radio correlation .",
    "different models have been proposed , explaining this correlation by advocating either the situation that cres are confined ( vlk @xcite ; lisenfeld et al .",
    "@xcite ) or that they can escape more or less freely ( chi & wolfendale @xcite ; helou & bicay @xcite ; niklas & beck @xcite ) .",
    "the interpretation of the radio spectrum in terms of the above mentioned processes is difficult because they are hard to disentangle without spatially resolved observations .",
    "furthermore , it is necessary to separate the diffuse radio emission from the thermal radio emission and the radio emission from snrs .",
    "the observational separation of the three contributions based on their different spectral indices is difficult , especially for the radio emission of snrs which has a similar spectral index as the diffuse synchrotron emission .",
    "the separation of the thermal radio emission is possible , if high - frequency radio data ( @xmath12 ghz ) are available , because its spectral index is very different .    in this paper",
    "we are going to examine the influence of these various processes on the radio spectral index .",
    "for this , we will start by estimating the contribution of snrs to the radio emission and to calculate its effect on the spectral index .",
    "then , we discuss within a simple model the influence of energy losses , the type of propagation and escape of cres on the spectral index .",
    "we estimate the fraction of the nonthermal radio emission of a galaxy that is expected to come from snrs in the framework of a simple leaky - box model .",
    "the number of cres in a certain energy range @xmath13 , @xmath14 , can then be calculated as : @xmath15 q(e ) is the production rate of cres and @xmath16 the life - time of cres .",
    "the main sources of cres are gravitational supernovae ( sn ) ( sn ii and ib / c ) ( e.g. xu et al .",
    "@xcite and discussion in xu et al @xcite ) .",
    "the energy spectrum of the cres produced can be described by a power law : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the sn - rate , @xmath19 the number of cres produced per energy interval per sn and @xmath20 the energy injection spectral index . for cres in snrs @xmath16",
    "is given by the life - time of the snr , @xmath21 , and for the diffuse cres @xmath22 can be expressed as :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the escape time - scale from the galaxy and @xmath25 is the energy loss time - scale .",
    "we take into account a possible energy dependence of @xmath26 according to :    @xmath27    the exponent @xmath28 can have different values depending on the characteristics of the propagation of cres .",
    "it is @xmath29 if @xmath30 and synchrotron and inverse compton losses are the dominant energy loss processes .",
    "if @xmath31 and cres propagate mainly by diffusion , the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient , @xmath32 , gets reflected in @xmath33 .",
    "if , on the other hand , cres can escape freely ( @xmath31 ) by convection or if adiabatic and bremsstrahlung losses are dominant , we expect @xmath34 .    in the case of a steady state ( @xmath35 ) the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqone ] ) is simply :    @xmath36    we make the simplification that an electron with energy @xmath37 emits all the synchrotron radiation at the frequency    @xmath38    ( longair @xcite , vol . 1 p. 332 )",
    "where @xmath39 is the gyrofrequency .",
    "then the total synchrotron emission is given by : @xmath40 with the energy losses by synchrotron radiation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the thompson scattering cross section , @xmath43 the magnetic field strength and @xmath44 its energy density .    with the above equations",
    ", we can express the ratio of the diffuse synchrotron emission to the emission from snrs as :    @xmath45    thus , the ratio of the diffuse synchrotron emission to the emission from snrs is mainly determined by the ratio of the life - times of cres in the two zones and by the ratio of the magnetic field strengths . the magnetic field strength in snrs is expected to be higher than in the diffuse ism because the gas in which the magnetic field is frozen - in gets compressed by the shock . in general , the magnetic field strength found in snrs exceeds the value expected by this compression which would be a factor of 4 in a strong shock , indicating that the magnetic field is not only compressed , but enhanced by the shock . especially in young snrs",

    "@xcite ) , for the life - time of a snr its adiabatic phase @xmath51 yr and for @xmath16 the energy loss time scale due to synchrotron and inverse compton losses . the latter yields for a magnetic field of 5 @xmath46 g and a radiation field of energy density 1 ev @xmath52 @xmath53 yr at @xmath54 ghz . with these values",
    "we get @xmath55 at a frequency 1.5 ghz .    a further contribution to the radio emission of a galaxy are radio supernovae ( rsne , e.g. weiler et al .",
    "their contribution is difficult to estimate due to uncertainties in their luminosity and life - time .",
    "prez - olea & colina ( @xcite ) have included rsne in a model for the radio emission of starburst galaxies by generalizing and extrapolating the luminosities of 9 observed rsne . adopting their numbers",

    ", their total radio emission would be a factor of 2 lower .",
    "thus , in spite of the uncertainties , it seems plausible that rsne contribute at a level of at least a few percent to the total radio emission of a galaxy .      in order to compare this theoretically derived ratio to observations",

    "a lower source spectral index of @xmath91 to @xmath92 is indicated by recent calculations by berezhko and vlk ( @xcite ) .",

    "eventually , cres might escape from the galaxy .    in order to discuss the radio spectral index in the various cases , we calculate two simple models , one that considers diffusion and one in which we study convection . in both models we take into account energy losses by synchrotron and inverse compton losses . here , we ignore adiabatic and bremsstrahlung losses which might also be important , especially in starburst galaxies , but since they do not change the spectral index , they are in the framework of the present study equivalent to no energy losses at all",

    "the expected diffuse and nonthermal spectral indices for different asymptotic cases are :    case ( 1 ) : synchrotron and inverse compton losses are very strong so that no escape is possible",

    "the observed @xmath87 is explained by a high escape probability ( @xmath134 ) . for a weaker energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient , @xmath135 , however , the predicted escape probability is lower , @xmath136 .",
    "the conclusion from the convection model is very different : here the observed @xmath87 is explained by @xmath137 .",
    "the different conclusions with respect to the escape probability given by the diffusion and the convection model are due to the fact that ( i ) convection is an energy independent process and ( ii ) in the case of convection the relation between the spectral index and the escape probability is not linear , in the sense that low escape probabilities are predicted for almost the whole range of spectral indices .    we conclude that from the observed average radio spectral index of galaxies it can neither be decided to which degree cres can escape from galaxies nor whether diffusion or convection is the dominant mode of propagation . only for asymptotic cases partial conclusions can be drawn : if the spectral index of a galaxy is very steep ( @xmath138 ) energy losses are important and the escape rate is low .",
    "yet , it can not be determined whether diffusion or convection is the dominant type of propagation .",
    "a very flat overall spectral index ( @xmath139 ) , on the other hand , indicates strong convection or almost energy independent diffusion . since measurements in our galaxy indicate that diffusion does depend significantly on energy ( @xmath140 , garca - muoz et al .",
    "convection is the more likely explanation . in this case , however , we can not draw any conclusions with respect to the confinement of cres .",
    "the question of how important energy losses are for the propagation of cres in a galaxy can be decided if the spectral index distribution in the halo is known .",
    "if the spectrum steepens considerably away from the disk , it is a clear sign that cres suffer considerable synchrotron and inverse compton losses as they propagate outwardly .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figthree ] and [ figfour ] , where we show the diffuse radio spectral index , @xmath141 , calculated from the convection and diffusion models of section 3.1 , as a function of the distance from the galactic plane , @xmath99 . in fig .",
    "[ figthree ] we show the results for a large halo ( @xmath142 kpc ) in which the energy losses affect the cres considerably before they manage to escape .",
    "the escape probabilities are here 9% for convection and 6% ( @xmath135 ) , respectively 10% ( @xmath126 ) for diffusion . in fig .",
    "[ figfour ] the opposite case is shown : a small halo ( @xmath143 kpc ) where the cres can escape without suffering significant energy losses , so that the escape probabilities lie between 78% for convection and 85% ( @xmath135 ) , respectively 87% ( @xmath126 ) for diffusion .",
    "we find that important energy losses are reflected clearly in a steepening of the spectral index with increasing distance from the plane . on the contrary , if the cres can escape almost freely , or if only adiabatic or bremsstrahlung losses occur , no such steepening is seen .",
    "the distribution of the spectral index in the halo is a definite diagnostic of whether energy losses are important .",
    "the observational study of radio halos in external galaxies is difficult , because the halos are extended and intrinsically faint ( see dahlem @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , not many galaxies with multi - frequency radio data for the halo are known .",
    "one of the best studied radio halos is that of the spiral galaxy ( hummel et al .",
    "its spatially integrated nonthermal radio spectral index is 0.78 ( niklas et al .",
    "@xcite ) , only slightly below the average spectral index of galaxies ( see fig  [ figtwo ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ figfive ] we show its radio spectral index distribution in the halo .",
    "the data are at a resolution of 40  , corresponding to 1.8 kpc at the distance of 9.5 kpc of .",
    "the spectrum steepens very quickly within the first 2 - 3 kpc .",
    "it continues to steepen more slowly outside this range , especially in the eastern side of the halo . here",
    ", the steepening becomes more pronounced at @xmath144 kpc .    in fig .",
    "[ figfive ] we also show the results of our model in which we have included , in order to correspond to the data , apart from the diffuse radio emission , the contribution from snrs and the thermal radio emission . for the latter two components we have assumed , @xmath145 , as before , and a contribution of the thermal radio emission of 10 % at 1.5 ghz , a typical value for normal galaxies ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "we furthermore assume that the thermal radio emission and the radio emission from snrs is restricted within 100 pc above the disk ( the exact value of this spatial extent is not important because of the low resolution of the data ) .",
    "finally , we convolve the model results with a gaussian beam of hpbw 1.8 kpc , corresponding to the resolution of the data .    we have adjusted the diffusion coefficient and convection velocity such that we achieved the best possible fit to the data .",
    "because of the simplicity of the models described here , we can not expect to describe the data in all detail , we are aiming rather at a qualitative comparison with the main features . for a quantitative comparison",
    "a more complex model would be necessary , combining diffusion and convection , taking into account spatial variations of the parameters ( @xmath146 , etc . ) and describing more realistically the distribution of snrs and the contribution of the thermal radio emission . nevertheless , the diffusion model is able to describe a large range of the data reasonably well .",
    "the fast steepening of the spectral index within the first 2 - 3 kpc above the disk can to a large extent be attributed to the contribution of snrs and the thermal radio emission close to the disk .",
    "the steepening outside this range requires the presence of dominant energy losses : the diffusion models that describe the data well have escape probabilities of 11 % ( dotted line ) and 0 % ( dashed line ) . for comparison a model with a high escape rate",
    "is shown ( 78 %  dashed - dotted line ) which is not able to describe the data . in order to reproduce the fast steepening of the spectral index at @xmath144 kpc in the western part of the halo , we would possibly have combine the diffusion model with the convection model .",
    "radio halos have been observed in several other galaxies , although mostly not in such detail . in all of these galaxies a steepening of the spectral index at least up to @xmath147 is found with increasing distance from the disk .",
    "this is the case for both starburst galaxies , as ( seaquist & odegard @xcite ; reuter et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; ( carilli et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; ( lisenfeld et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; ( sukumar et al .",

    "@xcite ) and non - starburst spiral galaxies like ( hummel & dettmar @xcite ) ; ( duric et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; and ( hummel & bosma @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude therefore that for all galaxies for which a multi - frequency radio halo has been observed , energy losses are important and it seems likely that this is generally the case in galactic halos .",
    "niklas & beck ( @xcite ) have found a trend that actively star - forming galaxies tend to have lower spectral indices and more quiescent galaxies steeper ones .",
    "they interpret this as an indication that in galaxies with a high star - formation efficiency ( sfe ) cres escape more easily due to a galactic wind . on the basis of the above consideration",
    ", however , it seems more likely that in these galaxies convection causes the flat spatially integrated spectrum .",
    "energy losses play an important role also in galaxies with a high sfe which is shown by the steepening of the spectral index in the halo .",
    "a good example is the starburst galaxy . for this galaxy the observed overall synchrotron spectral index @xmath148 ( niklas et al .",
    "@xcite ) indicates strong convection ( see fig .",
    "2 ) whereas at the same time the steepening of the spectral index in the halo shows the presence of important energy losses ( seaquist & odegard @xcite ; reuter et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the question whether cres can escape freely from galaxies or whether synchrotron and inverse compton losses determine their spectra has been asked in the framework of the fir / radio correlation .",
    "vlk ( @xcite ) has proposed a calorimeter model in which the tightness of the correlation can be explained by the fact that cres loose their energy by synchrotron and inverse compton losses below the energy level corresponding to the observing frequency before they are able to escape from a galaxy .",
    "lisenfeld et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have generalized this model , allowing for moderate escape and a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "other authors have claimed the opposite , i.e. that cres can escape more or less freely from the galaxy ( chi & wolfendale @xcite ; helou & bicay @xcite ; niklas & beck @xcite ) .    it has been argued ( niklas & beck @xcite ) that the observed spectral index of galaxies , @xmath149 , is in contradiction with the calorimeter model which predicts in its asymptotic version @xmath150 , corresponding to case ( 1 ) of section 3.3 .",
    "the difference between the prediction of the calorimeter model and observations of the radio spectral index can be decreased by allowing for moderate escape and a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field ( lisenfeld et al .",
    "@xcite ) and even more by including the contribution of snrs ( this work ) , so that such a modified calorimeter model would predict @xmath151 , corresponding to the observed average value .",
    "however , even in this case this model is not able to account for the flatter spectra that some of the galaxies ( e.g. ) show because it is based on diffusion . in this paper , we have shown , that for galaxies with such a low spectral index , convection is likely to be important . with respect to the question of whether confinement or escape is taking place the overall spectral index is not a good diagnostic .",
    "spatially resolved observations are necessary and these indicate that energy losses indeed do play a dominant role .",
    "thus , even for galaxies with a low overall spectral index , like , escape seems to be negligible as predicted by the calorimeter model .",
    "we have estimated and discussed different processes and components that shape the radio spectral index of a galaxy . in particular , we have considered the contribution of snrs , the influence of different types of cr propagation ( diffusion and convection ) and of energy losses ( inverse compton and synchrotron ) .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) we have estimated that the radio emission of snrs represents about 10% of the nonthermal radio emission of a galaxy .",
    "this moderate contribution has a noticeable effect on the nonthermal radio spectral index , lowering it by 0.1 for steep spectra .",
    "\\(ii ) the spatially integrated radio spectral index of a galaxy is difficult to interpret , as it is influenced by various processes . only for asymptotic cases conclusions",
    "can be drawn : in galaxies with very steep spectral indices ( @xmath138 ) energy losses are high and the escape rate of cre is low . a very flat spectral index ( @xmath139 ) , on the other hand , is a sign for strong convection .",
    "\\(iii ) in order to draw more general conclusions about the cr propagation and the importance of energy losses , spatially resolved radio observations of galactic halos are necessary . a steepening of the spectral index away from the galactic disk is a clear indication that inverse compton and synchrotron losses are important .",
    "\\(iv ) in all galaxies with multi - frequency radio data for the halo such a steepening has been found and therefore in these galaxies synchrotron and inverse compton losses take place .",
    "thus , it seems likely that these energy losses are generally important in galactic halos and that escape rates are low .",
    "the low overall spectral index that is frequently found in starburst galaxies , at the same time as the steepening of the spectrum away from the disk , can be interpreted as convection .",

    "<S> spatially resolved radio data for the halo of galaxies are necessary in order to draw firm conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> the steepening of the spectrum away from the disk is a clear indication that synchrotron and inverse compton losses are taking place during the propagation of cosmic ray electrons in the halo . in those galaxies </S>",
    "<S> for which spatially resolved data for the halos exist such a steepening has been found . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude therefore that energy losses are generally important and that cosmic ray electrons can not freely escape from galaxies . </S>"
