    "a closer look at the dice in figure [ path ] reveals that , in the long run , i will have an advantage in this game : whichever die you choose , i will choose the one immediately to its left ( and i will choose die c if you choose die a ) . in any case , the probability of my die beating yours is @xmath3 .",
    "+    this is a case of the phenomenon of _ non - transitive _ dice , first introduced by martin gardner in @xcite , and further explored in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "we also write @xmath12 to indicate the probability that , upon rolling both @xmath10 and @xmath13 , the number rolled on @xmath10 exceeds that on @xmath13 .",
    "a set of dice is _ non - transitive _ if each of @xmath14 and @xmath15 exceeds @xmath16 .",
    "that is , the relation `` is a better die than '' is non - transitive .    in this paper",
    "we ( mostly ) examine non - transitive sets of dice , but we introduce a new property as well .    a set of dice is _ balanced _ if @xmath17 .",
    "note that the set of dice in figure [ path ] is balanced , as @xmath18 .",
    "+ in theorem [ thm ] , we show that non - transitive balanced sets of @xmath0-sided dice exist for all @xmath1 .",
    "surprisingly , this is also the first proof that non - transitive sets of @xmath0-sided dice exist for all @xmath1 .",
    "we then prove in theorem [ facesum ] that a set of dice is balanced ( but not necessarily non - transitive ) if and only if the face - sums of the dice are equal ( the _ face - sum _ of a die is simply the sum of the numbers with which it is labeled ) .",
    "this then yields an @xmath2 algorithm for determining if a given triple of @xmath0-sided dice is non - transitive and balanced .",
    "finally , we consider generalizations to sets of four dice .",
    "the main goal in this section is to prove the following .",
    "[ thm ] for any @xmath1 , there exists a non - transitive set of balanced @xmath0-sided dice .",
    "first , we need some machinery .",
    "fix @xmath4 . for our purposes , a _ word _",
    "@xmath19 is a sequence of @xmath20 letters where each letter is either an @xmath21 or @xmath22 , and each of @xmath21 and @xmath22 appears @xmath0 times .",
    "if @xmath23 is a set of @xmath0-sided dice , define a word @xmath24 by the following rule : the @xmath25 letter of @xmath24 corresponds to the die on which the number @xmath26 labels a side .",
    "now let @xmath27 be a word .",
    "we define a function @xmath28 on the letters of @xmath19 as follows .",
    "@xmath29 similarly , define a function @xmath30 by @xmath31    for example , if @xmath32 , then @xmath33 is the number of sides of die @xmath13 whose labels precede @xmath26 .",
    "similarly , @xmath34 is the number of sides of die @xmath6 whose labels precede @xmath26 .    [",
    "3sided ] let @xmath23 be the following set of dice .",
    "@xmath35 then @xmath36 . note that this set of dice is balanced and non - transitive , as @xmath37 .",
    "conversely , given a word @xmath19 , let @xmath38 denote the unique set of dice corresponding to @xmath19 .",
    "as this is a one - to - one correspondence , we often speak of a set of dice and the associated word interchangeably .",
    "for instance , if @xmath27 is a @xmath20-letter word , the probability of die @xmath10 beating die @xmath13 is given by @xmath39 and the other probabilities may be computed analogously .",
    "thus , the property of a set @xmath23 of dice being balanced is equivalent to @xmath24 satisfying @xmath40 furthermore , if @xmath23 is a set of @xmath0-sided dice , then @xmath23 is non - transitive if and only if each of @xmath41 exceeds @xmath42 .",
    "although a set of dice @xmath23 and its associated word @xmath24 hold the same information , this alternate interpretation will prove invaluable in showing theorem [ thm ] .",
    "first , we need some lemmas . recall that the _ concatenation _ of two words @xmath19 and @xmath43 , for which we write @xmath44 , is simply the word @xmath19 followed by @xmath43 .    [ first ] let @xmath19 and @xmath43 be balanced words . then the concatenation @xmath45 is balanced .",
    "let @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath48 , then @xmath49 ( @xmath50 is defined as a subset of the @xmath51 with @xmath52 , so concatenating @xmath43 after @xmath19 contributes nothing to these ) .",
    "otherwise ( for @xmath53 ) , @xmath54 , because every letter from @xmath43 beats all @xmath55 letters from the appropriate die in @xmath19 , in addition to whichever letters it beats from the structure of @xmath43 itself .",
    "then @xmath56 we may repeat the argument for @xmath57 , and then we are done as @xmath19 and @xmath43 are balanced .    while lemma [ first ] is primarily useful for balanced words ( or sets of dice ) , the next result applies to arbitrary sets of non - transitive dice .",
    "[ concatbalanced ] let @xmath19 and @xmath43 be non - transitive words .",
    "then the concatenation @xmath44 is non - transitive .",
    "let @xmath19 be a word of length @xmath58 .",
    "because @xmath59 counts the number of rolls of dice @xmath10 and @xmath13 in which die @xmath10 beats die @xmath13 , we note that @xmath60 and an analogous statement holds for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "define a quantity @xmath63 by @xmath64    now let @xmath43 be a word of length @xmath20 , and define quantities @xmath65 and @xmath66 as above .",
    "note that @xmath67 because @xmath19 and @xmath43 are non - transitive . by equation [ concat ] , we have @xmath68 and so @xmath44 is non - transitive .    with the two lemmas above in place , we are now able to provide a quick proof of theorem [ thm ] , the main result of this section .",
    "example [ 3sided ] , along with    [ 4sided ] @xmath69    and    [ 5sided ] @xmath70    provide balanced , non - transitive sets of dice for @xmath71 , which give rise to balanced words for these @xmath0 , the smallest representatives ( in the context of the theorem ) for each congruence class modulo @xmath72 .",
    "lemmas [ first ] and [ concatbalanced ] then imply that the concatenation of two balanced non - transitive words is a balanced non - transitive word , and the correspondence between words and sets of dice completes the proof .",
    "after taking a closer look at example [ 3sided ] as well as the sets of balanced , non - transitive dice given in the proof of theorem [ thm ] , one may notice the following phenomenon : in any one of these sets of dice , the sum of the labels of any two dice are equal .",
    "formally , if @xmath23 is a set of @xmath0-sided dice and @xmath73 , we define the _ face - sums _ of @xmath23 to be @xmath74    [ facesum ] a set of dice @xmath23 ( or the corresponding word ) is balanced if and only if the face - sums of its dice are all equal .",
    "( _ only if _ ) let @xmath23 be a set of balanced dice , and @xmath24 the word associated with it . recall our definition for balanced words : @xmath75 which is obviously equivalent to @xmath76",
    "further define @xmath77 we focus on die @xmath10 ( with face - sum @xmath78 ) , and make two observations : first , for a face of @xmath10 , its label @xmath26 may be written as @xmath79 second , since @xmath10 has @xmath0 sides , @xmath80 then , @xmath81 however , this computation was independent of our choice of @xmath10 , so the other two are analogous , and every term in sight is equal as @xmath24 is balanced .",
    "+ ( _ if _ ) let @xmath23 be a set of @xmath0-sided dice ( with word @xmath24 ) , and assume that @xmath82 by the above , this is equivalent to @xmath83 write @xmath84 and analogously define @xmath85 then , we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 giving six equations in six unknowns .",
    "some straightforward linear algebra gives @xmath88 whence we also have @xmath89    applying the result of theorem [ facesum ] , we obtain the following algorithm for checking if a given partition of @xmath90 $ ] into @xmath72 size-@xmath0 subsets determines a set of balanced non - transitive dice .",

    "if this condition is met , check @xmath91 . if @xmath92 , the set of dice is balanced but fair .",
    "if @xmath93 , the set is balanced and non - transitive . if @xmath94 , switching the labels of sets @xmath13 and @xmath6 produces a balanced non - transitive set of dice .",
    "since this algorithm must check each pair of sides from dice @xmath10 and @xmath13 , it clearly runs in @xmath2 time .",
    "by contrast , not checking the face - sums , using only the probabilities to check balance would take roughly 3 times as long .",
    "in @xcite , savage forms sets of non - transitive dice from consecutive terms of the fibonacci sequence .",
    "we briefly explain his construction .",
    "( we let @xmath95 denote the @xmath25 fibonacci number , so that @xmath96 et cetera . )",
    "[ savage ] given a fibonacci number _ @xmath97 _ , consider the sequence @xmath98 beginning with the number @xmath99 , label die @xmath10 with @xmath100 consecutive descending integers",
    ". then label die @xmath13 with the next @xmath101 values , die @xmath6 with the next @xmath97 values , @xmath10 with the next @xmath101 values , and @xmath13 with the last ( ending in @xmath102 ) @xmath100 values .",
    "this produces a set of non - transitive dice ( which is never balanced ) .    in the case where @xmath97 is an _ odd _",
    "fibonacci number , a simple addition to this construction actually yields a balanced set .",
    "perform algorithm [ savage ] to obtain a set of non - transitive dice . then , swap the last element of the first set of values ( @xmath103 , to be precise ) , which is on die @xmath10 , with the first element of the second set of values ( @xmath104 ) , which is the largest number on die @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting set of dice is non - transitive and balanced .",
    "consider a modification of _ set of dice _ to mean four dice , labeled @xmath105 .",
    "then    [ 3sided4 ] @xmath106    [ 4sided4 ] @xmath107    [ 5sided4 ] @xmath108    give minimal examples for balanced non - transitive sets of dice . modifying to @xmath109-letter words ( with @xmath0 each of @xmath110 ) , the proof of theorem [ thm ] generalizes , which gives us the following .",
