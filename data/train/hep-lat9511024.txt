    "recently some measurements of the curvature  curvature correlation functions in 4d simplicial gravity were presented @xcite . the data seems to indicate negative and power like behavior both at the transition and in the elongated phase .",
    "the latter seems surprising as one would expect the exponential decay of correlations outside the critical region .",
    "those issues are hard to study numerically and even harder analytically . to gain some insight into possible mechanism of those correlations we investigate here a simple geometrical model : branched polymers ( bp ) .",
    "besides its simplicity there are some other motivations for using this model .",
    "the bp describe the @xmath0 limit of 2d simplicial gravity @xcite .",
    "it is believed that bp also describe the elongated phase of 4d simplicial gravity @xcite .",
    "however the exact correspondence between the quantities measured in ref .",
    "@xcite and bp is not known .",
    "nevertheless we can hope that the bp model captures the general features of the elongated phase of 4d simplicial gravity .",
    "we consider here the ensemble of _ planar rooted planted trees_. a _ tree _ is a graph without the closed loops .",
    "a _ rooted _ tree is a tree with one marked vertex ( root ) and _ planted _ tree is a tree whose root s _ degree _ ( number of branches ) is one .",
    "two trees are considered as distinct if they can not be mapped on each other by a continuous deformation of the plane ( see fig .",
    "[ tree ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the total number of non - root vertices in the tree and by @xmath2 the number of non - root vertices of the degree @xmath3 .",
    "then the ( grand ) partition function is defined as @xmath4 the @xmath5 denotes the ensemble of all the trees . the equation for @xmath6 is ( see fig .",
    "[ zeqfig ] ) @xcite    @xmath7    the equation ( [ zeq ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath8 and the critical point @xmath9 corresponds to a value @xmath10 where the right hand side of ( [ zeqbis ] ) has a minimum . in the neighborhood of this point for a large class of parameters",
    "@xmath11 the partition function behaves like @xcite @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "that is the only class of solutions of the equation ( [ zeq ] ) considered in this paper .",
    "behaviour described by ( [ zass ] ) is typical also for the elongated phase of the 4d simplicial gravity @xcite . from the equation ( [ zeq ] ) we can derive @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "first we consider a `` volume  volume '' correlation function @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ensemble of the trees with one point marked at distance @xmath18 from the root .",
    "the smallest possible tree in @xmath17 is a chain of @xmath18 non - root vertices which we split into root , body and tail ( see fig .",
    "[ geqfig]a ) .",
    "the weight of this chain is @xmath19 .",
    "all other configurations in @xmath17 can be obtained from this chain by attaching trees in its non - root vertices(see fig .",
    "[ geqfig]b ) . attaching @xmath1 trees in the body or",
    "root part of the chain corresponds to a factor @xmath20 .",
    "the factor @xmath21 counts the possible relative positions of the chain . attaching @xmath1 trees to",
    "the tail corresponds to a factor @xmath22 .",
    "finally our two - point function is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in the last equality we used the identity @xmath26 obtained by differentiating the equation ( [ zeq ] ) with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "we are interested in the root - tail correlation function defined as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the degree of vertex @xmath30 .",
    "the form of this function can be easily obtained by modifying @xmath31 @xmath32 where we used the identity @xmath33 again obtained by differentiating eq .",
    "( [ zeq ] ) twice with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "similarly we define two other functions @xmath34 @xmath35 let @xmath36 we define the normalized connected root - tail correlation function as @xmath37 it is easy to check that @xmath38",
    "the functions defined in the preceding chapter are the discrete laplace transforms of their canonical counterparts e.g. @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ensemble of the trees belonging to @xmath17 and having exactly @xmath1 non - root vertices . to calculate the canonical functions from grand canonical we have to perform the inverse of the discrete laplace transform .",
    "this usually can not be done exactly and we proceed with a series of approximations .",
    "the first approximation is that of replacing the discrete transform ( [ glap ] ) with the continuous one",
    ". then @xmath41 is given by the inverse laplace transform which we calculate by the saddle point method .",
    "the details are presented in appendix a. below we give results to the leading order in @xmath1 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "@xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    where we used @xmath47 .",
    "the connected correlation function @xmath48 is defined as in ( [ rtc ] ) . @xmath49 before writing it down let us note that the terms proportional to @xmath50 ( and so to @xmath51 ) in the exponents cancel between numerators and denominators in @xmath48 . for large @xmath1 and @xmath52 we can neglect the exponents .",
    "the resulting expression is @xmath53",
    "knowing the function @xmath54 it is easy to calculate ( [ rtf ] ) . the equation ( [ z0 ] ) can be solved numerically if the analytic solution is not available . below we give examples of two models . in both cases",
    "the correlations are negative .",
    "this was also the case for all other models we tested and we are persuaded that this is a general feature of the models with the expansion of the form ( [ zass ] ) and all the weights @xmath11 positive .",
    "1 .   @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 2 .",
    "@xmath58 , @xmath59@xcite . for @xmath60 , @xmath61",
    "the formula ( [ rtf ] ) is valid for @xmath62 . to check what finite size effects are to be expected we performed the mc simulations of the second model ( @xmath60 ) with @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 non - root vertices .",
    "the results for the @xmath66 are shown on fig .",
    "[ simul ] . we plotted the mc data , the large @xmath1 predictions ( formula ( [ rtex2 ] ) ) and the predictions for @xmath66 without neglecting the exponents ( the dotted lines ) .    [ ] [ ] [ 1][0]@xmath67",
    "the appearance of correlations in the canonical ensemble is not surprising . what is more surprising is that those correlations do not vanish in the limit . to understand better what is happening we calculate @xmath68 for the first model from previous section with by the explicit tree counting . in the fig .",
    "[ corn ] we list all the relevant groups of trees together with their respective weights .",
    "the upper formulas refer to the grand canonical ensemble and lower ones to canonical ensemble ( valid for @xmath69 ) .",
    "note that the first two trees can not appear in the canonical ensemble .",
    "if we calculate the @xmath66 using the grand canonical weights we get zero as expected . if we calculate the @xmath66 with grand canonical weights but exclude from the sum two first trees ( those forbidden in canonical ensemble ) we get a non - zero result depending on the value of @xmath70 . for the critical value @xmath71 the result is @xmath72 . repeating the calculations with canonical weights we obtain @xmath73 which agrees with ( [ rtex1 ] ) for @xmath74",
    "this would indicate that the effect is due to the absence of small configurations in the canonical ensemble .",
    "we have shown that a large class of bp models exhibits a long range negative power like correlations in the canonical ensemble .",
    "those correlations are not finite size effects and survive in the @xmath62 limit .",
    "the shape of those correlations bears a striking resemblance to the shape of correlation functions measured in 4d simplicial gravity @xcite . before making a detailed comparison one should keep in mind that the exact correspondence between the bp and 4d gravity is not known .",
    "the quantity measured in @xcite has only a qualitative resemblance to the quantity calculated here .",
    "we believe however that the same mechanism can be responsible for both .",
    "i would like to thank zdzislaw burda , jerzy jurkiewicz and jan smit for many helpful discussions and comments .",
    "this work is supported by the stichting voor fundamenteel onderzoek der matierie ( fom ) .",
    "the numerical simulations were partially carried out on the powerxplorer at sara .",
    "the inverse laplace transform ( continuous ) of @xmath31 is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "the saddle point equation is @xmath77 using the ( [ zass ] ) and ( [ gz ] ) we can expand the left hand side of ( [ sadle ] ) .",
    "because we are interested in @xmath78 we keep only the largest term of the expansion ( in @xmath79 ) of the left hand side of ( [ sadle ] ) . solving this",
    "we obtain @xmath80 , \\end{split}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\log(g(\\mu_s , t;r))}{\\partial \\mu^2}\\approx & \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{n^3}{\\left(r\\frac{z_0}{z_1}+\\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{z_1}{z_0}\\right)^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] putting it all together we get the formula ( [ gn ] ) .",
