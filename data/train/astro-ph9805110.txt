    "axaf hetg is designed to provide high resolution spectroscopy up to e/@xmath1e@xmath2 ( for point source ) between 0.4 kev and 10 kev .",
    "if the dla systems contain a sufficient column density of highly ionized metals , the high spectral resolution of the hetg will permit detection of resonance lines . for specificity ,",
    "we consider q2223 - 052 , a high redshift quasar at z = 1.404 which has a dla cloud at @xmath3 .",
    "x - ray observations with @xmath4 @xcite show its flux to be @xmath5 between 0.16 - 3.5 kev .",
    "this implies a count rate of 0.36 counts / sec with axaf meg in the first order .",
    "given the observation time and the instrument resolving power we can calculate the minimum detectable equivalent width of an absorption feature and the required ion column density . in table 1 @xmath6 is the required column density .",
    "here @xmath7 is the optical depth at the line center , and the velocity dispersion @xmath8 .",
    "all energies are in the observer frame .",
    "we assume the spectrum of the high - z quasar has the form of a power law + galactic absorption + an assumed resonance line from the dla system due to si  xiii at @xmath9 in the observer frame , then fit it with a model not containing the absorption line . in the @xmath10 plot",
    "we can clearly find the line .",

    "table 1 gives the minimum column density which could be detected the by axaf hetg .",
    "could a dla cloud gives such a column density ? to answer this question , we have simulated the ionization structure using the cloudy package @xcite .",
    "we assume the dla cloud is photonionizated by a power law continuum radiation with a mean intensity of @xmath13 at 1 rydberg , @xmath14 .",
    "the temperature and metallicity are fixed at @xmath15 and @xmath16=-0.5 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath13 is very uncertain , especially at low redshift .",
    "our calculation shows that only when @xmath17 are ion column densities high enough to produce resonance lines which could be detected by axaf hetg ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the results presented in the sixth column of table 2 is calculated with @xmath18 .",
    "haardt & madau @xcite give a value of @xmath19 at @xmath20 when taking into account qsos as the source of ionization .",
    "however , some other photonionization sources , such as the young stars inside the dla clouds and nearby quasars , may significantly increase the intensity of ionization photon flux . on the other hand",
    ", there may also exist other sources of ionization ( such as collisional ionization ) or other ionized material co - located with dla clouds , which would then simply be markers of higher density regions in an ionized intergalactic medium ."
