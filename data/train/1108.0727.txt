    "lunar - based astronomical observations have advantages over both ground - based and space - based observations .",
    "1 ) it has been known for decades that the moon is surrounded by an extremely tenuous atmosphere ( @xmath2 at night , and a much higher value @xmath3 in the daytime , see heiken et al .",
    "1991 ; stern 1999 for a review ) .",
    "this means that atmospheric opacity , atmospheric scattering / emission and , the atmospheric turbulence are absent .",
    "2 ) unlike space - based observations , the moon provides a large stable platform for maintaining astronomical instruments in permanently stable configurations .",
    "3 ) the sky s diurnal motion on the moon is @xmath4 , 27 times slower than on the earth .",
    "this allows long term monitoring for 13 days without interruption .",
    "4 ) the temperature in the permanent shadow regions ( pdrs ) at both poles of the moon could permanently be as low as 30k .",
    "pdrs are therefore ideal places for infrared observations .",
    "5 ) observations at very low frequency ( @xmath510mhz , vlf ) are feasible on the moon , but not on earth , because vlf electromagnetic waves can not penetrate the earth s ionosphere .    the apollo-16 mission performed far - ultraviolet observations on the lunar surface in 1972 for the first time in history ( page & carruthers 1977 ; carruthers & page 1977 ; carruthers & page 1972 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out with a 3-inch schmidt telescope equipped with a far - ultraviolet camera / spectrograph operating in the wavelength range from 100 - 160 nm . the field - of - view was about 20 , and the limiting magnitude was 11 .",
    "the telescope was placed in the shadow of the lunar module to avoid heating by the sun . in total ,",
    "178 images were obtained by the telescope , and delivered to the earth by the astronauts .",
    "in addition to the earth s geocorona , the observed objects included star clusters and the magellanic clouds .",
    "these observations , however , contributed little to astronomical knowledge because of the low level of the technology used at that time .",
    "the chinese change - iii mission is designed to deploy a dedicated , robotic lunar - based ultraviolet telescope ( lut , cao et al .",
    "2011 ) on the surface of the moon .",
    "lut will perform astronomical observations in near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) band .",
    "the main scientific goal of lut is to monitor variable stars and active galaxies in the nuv band for more than a dozen days",
    ". objects with large brightness variations in the nuv band include cataclysmic variable stars , large/ small mass binaries and novae , quasars and blazars , dme stars , and lyr rr stars .",
    "the variations of the stellar temperature , radius , and accretion rate of these compact objects can be studied , useful to verify current stellar atmosphere models and to investigate the origin of the instability .",
    "lut will additionally perform low - galactic - latitude sky surveys as a complement to the nasa galex ( galaxy evolution explorer ) mission ( martin et al . 2005 ) whose onboard mcps prevent from observing the bright objects with nuv@xmath510mag ( morrissey et al . 2005 ) . at present , lunar - based observations are only feasible in the moon daytime mainly due to the lack of electronic power supply at night .",
    "the indian chandrayaan-1 payload chandra s altitude composition explore ( chace ) recently claimed a lunar exosphere pressure of @xmath6torr ( sridharan et al .",
    "2010a , b ) , higher than that found by the apollo missions by 2 orders of magnitude ( see section 3 for more details ) .",
    "because of these new results , this paper wishes to estimate the effect of this potentially enhanced lunar exosphere on the signal - detection performance of lut .",
    "the sunlight can be scattered and/or re - radiated by the particles of the lunar exosphere .",
    "these processes mainly include rayleigh scattering , resonant scattering , and emissive photodissociation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after describing the basic properties of lut in section 2 , section 3",
    "briefly summarizes previous measurements of the lunar exosphere .",
    "the sky background brightness is calculated for the lunar exosphere in section 4 . the estimated brightness",
    "is then compared with the brightness of a point source with ab=13  mag .",
    "section 5 calculates the count rates at the lut focal plane , and estimates the final signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for an observation of a point source .",
    "as part of the scientific payload of the change - iii mission , lut will land on the moon and work in the lunar daytime ( cao et al .",
    "a limiting magnitude of ab=13  mag is designed for an exposure time of 30 seconds .",
    "the optical system of lut is a f/3.75 ritchey - chrtien telescope with an aperture of 150  mm .",
    "a pointing flat mirror mounted on a two - dimensional gimbal is used to point and track a given object .",
    "an ultraviolet - enhanced ccd e2v47 - 20 , manufactured by the eev company , is chosen as the detector mounted at the nasmyth focus .",
    "table 1 tabulates the designed performance parameters on which our subsequent calculations are based .",
    "we refer the readers to cao et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for more details on the mission s concept and design .",
    ".the designed performance parameters of lut [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]    [ figure1 ]",
    "we estimate the near - ultraviolet sky background brightness of the lunar exosphere .",
    "our calculations show that the sky brightness is @xmath0 within the wavelength range 245 - 340  nm .",
    "the signal - to - noise analysis indicates that the detection performance of lut can be degraded by the sky background emission in most cases .",
    "an ab=13  mag point source can be detected by lut at a signal - to - noise ratio above 8 when the oh concentration is less than @xmath1 .",
    "however , the effect on the performance is not ignorable when the exosphere is as dense as suggested by chace .",
