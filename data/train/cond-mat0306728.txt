    "in developing the formal structure of thermodynamics , one usually starts from the maximum entropy principle as the guiding principle that is used to predict the equilibrium conditions which apply to isolated systems .",
    "this is , actually , the way the subject was introduced by callen in his celebrated book  @xcite . crucially important in his presentation of equilibrium thermodynamics",
    "is the proof of the equivalence between different representations which are based on different choices of the natural variables that can be introduced in order to describe the macroscopic state of the system .",
    "such a proof implies an extension of the extremum principle to other thermodynamic schemes .",
    "however , the approach that is usually pursued to justify the above equivalence , albeit physically well founded , may be not completely satisfactory on the formal side .",
    "more specifically , the ordinary proof of the minimum energy principle is formulated for a system with just one degree of freedom and its extension to a thermodynamic space of higher dimensionality is not , in our opinion , straightforward .",
    "this state of affairs is also probably responsible for the somewhat uncertain status of `` thermodynamic potentials '' with multiple minima that are usually introduced when discussing first - order phase transitions  @xcite . actually , it is not immediately clear how such a potential , which fails to fulfil the convexity requirement , is related to the fundamental equation of the system , unless one explicitly intends to represent a landau free energy , _",
    "i.e. _ , the outcome of a mean - field calculation .    for the above reasons ,",
    "we believe that it can be useful to revisit the proof of the extremum principles used in thermodynamics in order to place all representations on a more clear mathematical basis which may turn useful also for a pedagogical presentation of the subject .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we provide a general proof of the minimum energy principle based on the concavity property of the entropy function .",
    "then , upon discussing the case of a system in contact with a reservoir , we derive in section 3 other forms of the extremum principle which apply to the generalized thermodynamic potentials and related massieu functions .",
    "we also analyze the pattern of singularities of , say , the gibbs free energy in proximity to a first - order transition point .",
    "some further remarks and a brief summary of the main results are given in the conclusions .",
    "following callen  @xcite , the fundamental problem of thermodynamics is to find the equilibrium state of an _ overall isolated _ macroscopic system following the removal of one or more internal constraints , _",
    "i.e. _ , walls restrictive with respect to the exchange of energy and , possibly , of other extensive quantities between the various parts of the system .",
    "as is well known , the solution to this problem can be cast in terms of the maximum entropy principle : the equilibrium state eventually singled out by the system is the one that maximizes the total entropy out of the variety of states that are compatible with the residual constraints .",
    "thermodynamics essentially postulates three properties for the entropy @xmath0",
    "@xcite : 1 ) @xmath0 is a well - behaved , first - order homogeneous function of the extensive parameters ( a property leading to euler s theorem ( [ eq1 ] ) ) ; 2 ) @xmath0 is additive over disjoint subsystems ; and 3 ) the partial derivative of @xmath0 with respect to the energy @xmath1 is strictly positive ( implying that the temperature @xmath2 ) . in particular , this latter condition allows one to express the energy as a function of the entropy as well as of the other extensive parameters @xmath3 which specify the state of the system , in such a way that the knowledge of @xmath4 is equivalent to that of @xmath5 . in the following",
    ", we shall ignore any exception to the above conditions such as those arising from the existence of long - ranged interactions between the constituent particles ( additivity and , possibly , extensivity violated ) , or from an effective ergodicity breaking ( which causes the unattainability of equilibrium ) .    in order to set the stage for our subsequent reasoning",
    ", we consider an isolated system described by the energy @xmath1 , the volume @xmath6 , and the number of particles @xmath7 as the only extensive parameters . for this system ,",
    "the entropy is written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the partial derivative of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this condition allows one to solve eq.([eq1 ] ) in @xmath1 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the temperature , @xmath14 is the pressure , and @xmath15 is the chemical potential .",
    "it is useful to recall that , given a function @xmath16 with @xmath17 , the variable @xmath18 can be expressed , on fairly general grounds , in terms of @xmath19 as @xmath20 , with @xmath21 then , the partial derivatives of @xmath0 can be identified as : @xmath22    it is now possible to show that the maximum principle , along with the extensivity and additivity properties , underlies the concavity of the entropy function .",
    "let @xmath23 be any number with @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath25 and @xmath26 identify two generic macroscopic states of the system .",
    "imagine , then , to form a single isolated system by putting together a fraction @xmath27 of @xmath25 and a fraction @xmath23 of @xmath26 .",
    "once the exchange of @xmath28 , and @xmath7 between the two subsystems is allowed , the overall system evolves until its entropy reaches a value @xmath29 which is larger than ( or at most equal to ) the initial value @xmath30 .",
    "thanks to the extensivity of the entropy , this readily implies that @xmath0 is a _ concave _ function of @xmath28 , and @xmath7 : @xmath31 in deriving eq.([eq5 ] ) , we have tacitly assumed that the state space is a convex set .",
    "this assumption is physically reasonable as , for instance , the set @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is an open convex subset of @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the occurrence of an equality sign in ( [ eq5 ] ) is linked with the phenomenon of phase coexistence , _",
    "i.e. _ , with the occurrence of a first - order phase transition .",
    "in such a case , the system is macroscopically inhomogeneous and the state @xmath35 is interpreted as a mixture of the phases @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "hence , unless two distinct thermodynamic phases can coexist , @xmath36 is a _",
    "strictly _ concave function of @xmath37 ( _ i.e. _ , eq.([eq5 ] ) holds as a strict inequality ) .",
    "owing to the concavity of the entropy , the hessian form of @xmath0 is negative semidefinite ( see theorem 3 in appendix a of @xcite ) , a property that is usually expressed as @xmath38 . upon taking in eq.([eq5 ] ) @xmath39 , the @xmath40 hessian of @xmath0 turns out to be negative semidefinite as well .",
    "this condition yields the inequalities  @xcite : @xmath41 which are to be satisfied for all @xmath42 .",
    "these inequalities represent the conditions of thermodynamic stability for a system at equilibrium .",
    "it follows from eqs.([eq6 ] ) that the constant - volume and constant - pressure heat capacities and the isothermal and isentropic compressibilities are non negative quantities  @xcite .",
    "similar stability conditions do also hold for @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , a rather straightforward calculation along the same lines as those leading to eqs.(b33)-(b35 ) of @xcite , yields : @xmath44 \\geq 0\\ , ; \\nonumber \\\\",
    "u_{ss}u_{vv}-u_{sv}^2&=&t(s , v , n)^4\\left ( s_{uu}s_{vv}-s_{uv}^2\\right ) \\geq 0\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as for the sign of @xmath45 , note that the quantity within square brackets is the value taken in @xmath46 by the @xmath40 hessian of @xmath0 relative to @xmath47 .",
    "now , let us consider an isolated system composed of two weakly interacting subsystems ( say , 1 and 2 ) , not necessarily made of the same substance , which , after removing an internal wall , may exchange energy and one more extensive quantity ( _ e.g. _ , the volume @xmath6 ) between each other . hereafter , we shall omit in the notation explicit reference to any other extensive parameter that is separately conserved for each subsystem .",
    "the equilibrium state eventually reached by the system is the state that maximizes the total entropy @xmath48 with respect to the parameters of subsystem 1 . in eq.([eq8 ] ) , @xmath1 and @xmath6 are the ( fixed ) values of energy and volume pertaining to the entire system .",
    "it is worth noting that the concavity of @xmath49 and @xmath50 implies that @xmath51 as well is a concave function of @xmath52 and @xmath53 : @xmath54 as a result , the @xmath55 hessian of @xmath51 is negative semidefinite , which implies : @xmath56    we now turn to the maximum condition for @xmath51 .",
    "the necessary conditions for any extremal point @xmath57 of @xmath51 are : @xmath58 @xmath59 these equations merely express the well known fact that the conditions of thermal and mechanical equilibrium between subsystems 1 and 2 entail the same values of temperature and pressure for both subsystems .",
    "furthermore , because of the concavity property , any extremum of @xmath51 is necessarily a global maximum , which is moreover strict if @xmath51 is strictly concave ( see theorem 1 and the corollary of theorem 2 in appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "the solution to eqs.([eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) is generally unique ( say , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "in fact , even if the final equilibrium state hosted two coexisting phases , the values of energy and volume of each subsystem would be uniquely determined from ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) , owing to the fact that @xmath62 and @xmath63 are fixed .",
    "note that the _ derivatives _ of @xmath64 are well - defined only when the point of maximum of @xmath51 is unique . in this case : @xmath65 we further notice that , if @xmath49 and @xmath50 happen to be the same function @xmath0 ( _ i.e. _ , they pertain to the same substance ) , then @xmath66 is a concave function of @xmath1 and @xmath6 .    we now proceed to demonstrate that the maximum entropy principle can be reformulated as a minimum principle for the total energy , under a constraint on the value of the total entropy . to begin with , we call @xmath67 the energy function of subsystem 1 , obtained from @xmath68 by solving the latter with respect to @xmath52",
    ". similarly , let @xmath69 be the energy of subsystem 2 .",
    "the crucial step in our proof of the minimum energy principle will be to show that @xmath70 and @xmath71 are convex functions .",
    "to this aim , all we need to recall is that @xmath72 ( as well as @xmath71 ) is an increasing function of its former argument , since @xmath73 . setting @xmath74 and @xmath75 ,",
    "the concavity of @xmath49 , @xmath76 can be rewritten as @xmath77 after evaluating @xmath70 at the point @xmath78 , it immediately follows from eq.([eq16 ] ) that : @xmath79 under such premises , we shall now prove that , if the total entropy takes the value @xmath80 , then the function @xmath81 attains its minimum for @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is _ any _ solution to eqs.([eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the minimum value of @xmath85 is @xmath1 .",
    "we start noting , using an argument identical to that already developed for @xmath51 , that @xmath85 is a convex function of @xmath86 and @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , in order to achieve our goal , all we need to show is that the first - order derivatives of @xmath85 at @xmath87 are both zero , since then the convexity of @xmath85 allows one to conclude that the extremum is a global minimum .",
    "the general expression of the first - order derivatives of @xmath85 is : @xmath88 @xmath89 when @xmath90 and @xmath82 , the energy of subsystem 1 is @xmath91 since @xmath70 is the inverse of @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , @xmath92 which implies : @xmath93 given eqs.([eq21 ] ) and ( [ eq23 ] ) , it follows from eq.([eq11 ] ) that @xmath94 .",
    "this result , when combined with eq.([eq12 ] ) , yields @xmath95 . finally , the absolute minimum of @xmath85 is clearly @xmath1 ( see eqs.([eq21 ] ) and ( [ eq23 ] ) ) and this completes our proof .",
    "we further note that @xmath96 is the inverse function of @xmath97 .",
    "in fact , for arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath6 , we have shown that @xmath98 .",
    "we point out that the hypothesis according to which the subsystems can only exchange two extensive parameters between each other does not affect the generality of our proof of the minimum energy principle ; rather , this restriction simply avoids the use of a cumbersome notation .",
    "a different derivation of the minimum energy principle , which does not resort to the convexity of @xmath85 , is also viable . in this case",
    ", one must show that the @xmath99 hessian of @xmath85 for @xmath82 and @xmath90 is positive definite .",
    "actually , what can be achieved this way is a weaker result , _",
    "i.e. _ , that the hessian of @xmath85 at the extremal point is positive _ semi_definite .    using eqs.([eq7 ] ) , one immediately gets for @xmath82 and @xmath90 : @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , whereas the arguments of the second - order @xmath51 derivatives are @xmath103 , and @xmath6 .",
    "equations ( [ eq24 ] ) also lead to : @xmath104 which concludes the proof that the hessian of @xmath85 is positive semidefinite in the final equilibrium state . besides the general impossibility to conclude , on account of the above inequalities , that the @xmath85 extremum is a minimum ( in fact",
    ", we are abstaining from using the convexity of @xmath85 ) , the intrinsic limitation of the latter proof of the minimum energy principle lies in the fact that it only applies when the subsystems are allowed to mutually exchange at most _ two _ extensive parameters .",
    "in fact , only in this case the character of the hessian of @xmath85 in the final equilibrium state can be decided in a relatively simple way on the basis of the sign of the second - order derivatives .",
    "thermodynamic representations other than the entropy or the energy schemes arise when describing the equilibrium of a system that is in contact with a reservoir .",
    "let us consider , for instance , an energy reservoir ( heat bath ) . by definition ,",
    "the temperature of a heat bath is the same in any state , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath105 a constant number which does not depend on the energy @xmath106 or the volume @xmath107 of the reservoir .",
    "hence , the entropy of a heat bath reads as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is an unspecified , concave function of @xmath107 . as usual",
    ", we omitted to specify the particle number in the notation .",
    "when a system with an entropy function @xmath110 is brought into contact with a heat bath , the joint system being isolated from the outside environment , the final equilibrium state maximizes the total entropy @xmath111 for fixed @xmath112 , and @xmath107 ( we assume that a rigid and impermeable wall keeps the system separate from the bath ) .",
    "the maximum condition then reads : @xmath113 which is equivalent to @xmath114 , @xmath115 being the inverse function of @xmath110 .",
    "it might happen that the solution @xmath116 to eq.([b4 ] ) is not unique .",
    "however , if @xmath110 is strictly concave , there is a unique point of maximum @xmath117 for @xmath51 , which represents the equilibrium value of the system energy . in this case , the system entropy in the joint equilibrium state is also well - defined , being @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "let us now introduce the convex function of @xmath1 and @xmath6 given by  @xcite @xmath120 by simply looking at its derivatives , @xmath121 it is immediately apparent that the maximum condition for @xmath51 is also the minimum condition for @xmath122 .",
    "we call @xmath122 a generalized thermodynamic potential . the minimum value @xmath123 of @xmath122 is the usual helmholtz free energy .",
    "in fact , @xmath123 is the legendre transform of @xmath115 with respect to @xmath0 : @xmath124 _ { s = s^0(t , v)}\\ , , \\label{b7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we observe that @xmath125 is the unique solution to @xmath114 ( a more general case is treated below ) .",
    "it is rather simple to calculate the first - order @xmath126 derivatives : @xmath127 @xmath128 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -ts_v(u^0(t , v),v)=-\\frac{s_v(u^0(t , v),v)}{s_u(u^0(t , v),v ) } = u_v(s^0(t , v),v ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -p(s^0(t , v),v)\\equiv -p^0(t , v)\\ , .",
    "\\label{b9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to calculate the second - order derivatives of @xmath126 we make use of eqs.(b5 ) and ( b7 ) of @xcite : @xmath129 it thus follows that @xmath126 is a concave function of @xmath130 and a convex function of @xmath6 .",
    "let us now consider the case of multiple solutions to eq.([b4 ] ) .",
    "for instance , it may happen for a particular value @xmath131 of @xmath130 that eq.([b4 ] ) is solved by all @xmath132 $ ] , with @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "this occurs if , between @xmath135 and @xmath136 , @xmath110 is a linear function of @xmath1 ( first - order transition at temperature @xmath131 ) . in this case , @xmath137 is satisfied for all @xmath138 $ ] , and @xmath139 can not be inverted as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "however , the function @xmath122 is still well - defined , along with its global minimum @xmath140 .",
    "furthermore , eq.([b7 ] ) still holds , provided we call @xmath125 the _ unique _ solution to @xmath141 .",
    "in particular , @xmath142 which means that @xmath123 is continuous for @xmath143 .",
    "however , @xmath123 has a cusp - like singularity for @xmath143 : @xmath144    as a further example , let us consider the case of a system exchanging energy and volume with a reservoir .",
    "the values of temperature and pressure are both fixed for the reservoir : @xmath145 therefore , the bath entropy is now fully specified as @xmath146 the maximum conditions for the total entropy @xmath147 then read : @xmath148 @xmath149 assuming a unique solution for the above equations , one finds @xmath150 and @xmath151 . upon assuming @xmath152 to be @xmath153",
    ", one has @xmath154",
    ". moreover , eqs.([b16 ] ) and ( [ b17 ] ) are equivalent to @xmath114 and @xmath155 .",
    "as we did previously for a system in contact with a heat bath , it is appropriate to introduce the auxiliary , convex function of @xmath1 and @xmath6 , given by @xmath156 clearly , @xmath157 attains its minimum for @xmath150 and @xmath151 , since @xmath158 are both zero .",
    "the minimum value @xmath159 of @xmath157 is the gibbs free energy .",
    "in fact , @xmath160 _ { s = s^0(t , p),v = v^0(t , p ) } \\label{b20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the legendre transform of @xmath115 with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath6 , which have been replaced by their conjugate variables @xmath130 and @xmath161 ( observe that @xmath162 is , by our previous assumption , the unique solution to @xmath114 and @xmath155 ) .",
    "the first - order derivatives of @xmath163 are simply calculated as : @xmath164 + pv^0_t(t , p ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -s^0(t , p)\\ , ; \\label{b21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath165 + v^0(t , p ) + pv^0_p(t , p ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & v^0(t , p)\\ , , \\label{b22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas , with the help of eqs.(b20)-(b22 ) and ( b24 ) of @xcite , the second - order @xmath163 derivatives turn out to be : @xmath166 hence , @xmath163 is a concave function of both @xmath130 and @xmath167 .    summing up ,",
    "when a system is in thermal and mechanical contact with a reservoir , it is @xmath157 ( the generalized gibbs potential ) that is minimum at equilibrium , not the gibbs free energy as is sometimes stated . similarly , if the wall between the system and the reservoir is permeable to the flow of energy and particles while being restrictive to volume , it is @xmath168 that is minimized at equilibrium , its minimum value being the system grand potential .",
    "needless to say , equivalent maximum principles hold for the functions @xmath169 and @xmath170 , equal to @xmath171 and @xmath172 , respectively .",
    "their maximum loci correspond to the usual massieu functions .",
    "it is worth observing that the minimization of the generalized gibbs potential is correct also in the common situation of determining the equilibrium between two systems that are in contact with the same energy and volume reservoir .",
    "in fact , the maximum condition for the total entropy @xmath173 can be rather obviously translated into the minimum condition for the convex function @xmath174 as immediately follows from computing the partial derivatives of eq.([b25 ] ) .    in closing , we re - examine the question of the shape of the thermodynamic potentials for a system undergoing a discontinuous phase transition .",
    "the gibbs free energy is the thermodynamic potential that is usually considered for describing the phases of matter .",
    "this quantity stems from @xmath157 after tracing the locus of its global minimum as a function of @xmath130 and @xmath167 .",
    "when a discontinuous phase transition line is approached , a piece of ruled surface appears in the profile of the fundamental relation , and then also in the graph of @xmath157 , which remains convex , even though not everywhere strictly convex .",
    "this implies a discontinuous evolution for the location of the absolute @xmath157 minimum ( not for the absolute minimum itself ! ) , _ i.e. _ , a jump from one valley to another as soon as the coexistence line is crossed .",
    "while one single minimum is the rule for @xmath157 in the thermodynamic limit , this is not generally true for a _ finite _ system . in the framework of the statistical - mechanical foundations of thermodynamics ,",
    "this means that the microcanonical @xmath36 of the finite system may not be everywhere concave  @xcite .",
    "in fact , near the would - be first - order transition point , a dip will usually appear in the @xmath0 profile which is responsible for the phenomenon of metastability . in turn",
    ", @xmath157 is not everywhere convex and a competition arises between two different local minima : while the deepest minimum characterizes the most stable phase , the other one , as long as it is present , will be the sign that another phase is at least metastable ( this is the usual occurrence in mean - field treatments of first - order transitions ) .",
    "the infinite - size behavior of @xmath157 is sketched in fig.1 , where its typical profile close to a first - order transition point is shown . here",
    ", @xmath175 is plotted as a function of @xmath176 at constant @xmath130 , for a number of values of @xmath167 across the coexistence line relative to , say , the liquid and the vapor of a substance ( only a slice of the gibbs surface along a locus @xmath177 passing through the actual point of minimum of @xmath157 is represented in the figure ) .",
    "the abscissa of the @xmath157 minimum gives the specific volume of the most stable system phase for the given @xmath130 and @xmath167 values . at the same time",
    ", the @xmath163 profile will show , both as a function of @xmath167 at constant @xmath130 as well as a function of @xmath130 at constant @xmath167 , a cusp - like singularity of the same kind discussed before for the helmholtz free energy , which is responsible for the discontinuities of volume and entropy , respectively , across the transition .",
    "starting from the maximum entropy principle , we have provided a detailed derivation of the principle of minimum energy and of similar principles for thermodynamic potentials and massieu functions , by resorting to the mathematical theory of concave many - variable functions .",
    "this calculation was also motivated by the fact that standard reference books on thermodynamics usually do not give enough information about this point . in our opinion , proving the interchangeability of all thermodynamic representations is a necessary prerequisite that allows the interested reader to fully appreciate the elegance of the thermodynamic formalism .          an expanded version of the present article , containing two appendices with some useful technical material , is available at http://www.me.infm.it/~prestip .",
    "in particular , appendix a of the web version summarizes some properties of concave ( and convex ) functions that are used in the following , while appendix b collects a number of relevant results concerning legendre transforms and their derivatives .",
    "observe that for a generic quadratic form of two variables , @xmath178 $ ] ( where @xmath179 ) , @xmath180 is positive definite iff @xmath181 and @xmath182 , and negative definite iff @xmath183 and @xmath182 .",
