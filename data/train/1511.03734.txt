    "it has long been recognized that star formation in galaxies is dependent on the local density of galaxies , usually referred to as the star formation ( sfr)density , or color  density relation @xcite .",
    "these environmental trends are partly the result of a mass - density relation in which more massive galaxies are in general redder and older , and are proportionally more abundant in denser environments @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown that the sfr  density relation also holds at a fixed stellar mass @xcite , suggesting that environment is also a key factor in shaping the properties of galaxies .",
    "furthermore , recent studies at @xmath6 have found that the effect of environment primarily alters the fraction of quiescent galaxies rather than reducing the star formation rate of galaxies on the star - forming main - sequence @xcite , favoring a quenching process which operates over a short timescale ( but see @xcite for an alternative perspective ) .",
    "while studies at z > 1 have been undertaken , their is no clear consensus on the existence of a similar sfr - density relation at high redshift .",
    "while the environmental effect is apparently weaker at higher redshifts , it is debated whether the sfr - density relation flattens or even reverses beyond @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the inconsistency among different results may be attributed to sample size , redshift uncertainties , the spectroscopic sampling rates @xcite , as well as varying definitions of environments  physical environments ( e.g. , voids , field , filaments , clusters , etc ) versus local densities @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have measured the color - density relation in the cosmos field out to @xmath8 in a self - consistent way and concluded that the environmental dependence is seen out to @xmath9 , but then becomes much weaker or none at higher - redshifts , inconsistent with the trend predicted in the semi - analytic models in which the local color  density relation persists out to much higher redshits @xcite .",
    "most environmental studies of galaxy properties beyond local universe are based either on a galaxy sample with a low ( or moderate ) spectroscopic sampling rate , or on a more complete sample but with photometric redshifts . in both cases ,",
    "the density measurements are subject to large uncertainties @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the environmental dependence can be sensitive to the scale on which density is measured , because the mechanisms that transform galaxies from the star - forming sequence to the quiescent population may only be active on certain physical scales .",
    "indeed , @xcite shows that the red fraction ",
    "density relation has such a scale dependence and can be used to constrain the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) prescription .",
    "therefore , special attention is required when interpreting the color - density relation and its scale dependence .",
    "despite the fact that the local density field is widely used to probe environmental effects , it is not directly linked to the underlying large - scale structures as evident by the large scatters in the relationship between local density and halo mass @xcite .",
    "alternatively , galaxy clustering is an effective tracer of halo mass to investigate the environmental dependence of galaxy properties .",
    "previous works on the clustering analysis of low - redshift galaxies have suggested that quiescent galaxies on average are located in more massive halos than star - forming galaxies at a fixed stellar mass@xcite , in agreement with that inferred using local - density estimators . at redshifts greater than one ,",
    "the results based on a stellar mass - selected sample are varied due to the limited size of quiescent galaxy samples .",
    "for example , using @xmath10 color - selected @xmath11 galaxies , @xcite found that quiescent galaxies have higher clustering amplitude than star - forming galaxies at a fixed stellar mass ( also see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , similar to the trend seen at lower redshifts .",
    "in contrast , @xcite study the @xmath10 galaxies selected from the cosmos field , and do not find a significant difference in the clustering strength between the quiescent and star - forming populations .    in this study , we probe environmental effects on galaxy properties by combining two different approaches : local galaxy density and clustering , using data taken from the spitzer large area survey with hyper - suprime - cam ( splash ) and the latest photometric redshift catalog in the cosmos field @xcite .",
    "the splash program consists of 2475h ( @xmath12h / pointing ) of spitzer irac 3.6and 4.5   observations of the two hyper - suprime - cam ultra - deep fields , cosmos @xcite and sxds @xcite .",
    "the addition of the deep splash data allows more accurate measurements of stellar mass for galaxies .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in  2 , we describe the sample , and explain the redshift and stellar mass measurements . in  3 , we study the impact of photometric redshift uncertainty on the density measurement and the color  density relation .",
    "the main results are presented in  4 and  5 . in  6",

    "although it is not feasible to precisely quantify the photometric redshift performance for a nir - selected sample as used in this work , we note that our simulation tests used to quantify the impact of photometric redshift error on the color  density relation extend to higher redshift uncertainties and outlier rates than quoted for the aforementioned @xmath31-selected samples .    after obtaining an accurate photometric redshift ,",
    "stellar masses are derived using the stellar population synthesis models of @xcite , assuming a chabrier imf @xcite , combining exponentially declining star formation history and delayed star formation history ( sfr @xmath32 @xmath33 ) and considering solar and half - solar metallicities .",
    "emission lines are added following the procedure of @xcite by estimating the [ oii ] emission line flux from the uv luminosity of the rescaled template , using the @xcite calibration laws , and by adopting certain line ratios relative to [ oii ] for other lines .",

    "[ fig : sm - z],width=340 ]        since the near - infrared data is essential for the study of galaxies beyond @xmath36 , we first construct a faint galaxy sample having @xmath23 < 24 , which roughly corresponds to the depth of the shallower part of ultravista data , namely the ` deep ' stripe .",
    "we further remove galaxies with s / n < 2 as the @xmath37 band photometry for those galaxies does not provide useful information in terms of photometric redshift determination . for galaxies with   @xmath38 at @xmath39 , all objects except 4 are detected in more than 25 filters , ensuring sufficient bandpasses for the computation of a photometric redshift and stellar population parameters . in figure",
    "[ fig : sm - z ] , we show the stellar mass versus redshift distribution for galaxies satisfying our k - band selection .",
    "following @xcite , we classify the star - forming and quiescent populations according to their locations on the nuv - @xmath40 and @xmath41 plane ( see figure [ fig : color ] ) .",
    "this color selection has been used to study the evolution of stellar mass function for different types of galaxies up to @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : sm - z ] , the quiescent galaxies become progressively incomplete at high - redshifts .",
    "@xcite estimate that the stellar mass limit for the quiescent galaxies is @xmath43 10@xmath44 at @xmath45 .",
    "we therefore further limit our analysis in  4 and  5 to galaxies with   > 10@xmath46 over the full redshift range of @xmath47 . on the other hand",
    ", we include galaxies with   @xmath38 when computing the local density . one caveat of our density measurement is that the density field may be underestimated because of the incompleteness of quiescent galaxies in the range of 10@xmath48 and 10@xmath44 at @xmath49",
    ". however , we note that the quiescent fraction decreases rapidly with decreasing stellar mass , and is less than 20% for galaxies with   @xmath50 even in the cluster environments at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we therefore do not expect a significant impact on the density measurement due to the lack of low - mass quiescent galaxies if they exist .",
    "the local density is computed using two common approaches used in the literature , the ` fixed aperture ' method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which we count the number of galaxies within a cylinder centered at the position of each galaxy , and the ` @xmath51 nearest - neighbor ' method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for which the surface area is defined as the area enclosed by the @xmath51 nearest neighbor in the projected plane .",
    "the aperture size of the cylinder in the right ascension ( ra ) and declination ( dec ) directions used when adopting the fixed aperture method ranges from 0.2 to 0.9 physical .",
    "the length in the line - of - sight direction in both methods is set to be 0.04 @xmath52 , comparable to the photometric redshift uncertainty of this catalog . for each galaxy , the overdensity ( @xmath53 ) is then defined as the density divided by the median density of all the galaxies located at similar redshifts ( within @xmath54 of 0.04 @xmath52 ) . since the density is computed by searching for neighbors within a small redshift interval around each galaxy before binning the redshifts for the density and clustering analysis , the neighboring galaxies falling outside the edge of each redshit bin would still be counted for the density measurement .",
    "therefore our results are not affected by the redshift edge effect which is mentioned in @xcite .",
    "because of the uncertainty on photometric redshifts , the local density measurement is likely subject to large errors .",
    "therefore it is crucial to quantify the reliability of the density measurements to investigate the correlation with galaxy properties .",
    "there have been many early works attempting to quantify the effect of photometric redshift uncertainly on the density determination .",
    "for example , @xcite conclude that the galaxy density measurement is problematic for samples with photometric redshift accuracy less the 0.02% .",
    "however , it is later realized that their work was based upon a shallower magnitude - limited data set ( in private communication with m. cooper ) , and the simulation they used underestimates the density of galaxies at the cluster core @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies , on the other hand , have demonstrated that photometric reshift datasets are promising for detecting the color - density relation by utilizing simulations @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have studied the effects of photometric redshift precision and outliers in great detail and concluded that the color - density relation is detectable out to @xmath55 even in the case of   up to 0.06 .",
    "we followed a similar approach as described in @xcite to understand the systematics / bias of our density measurements and extend the analysis to @xmath45 by using mock galaxy catalogs .",
    "the mock catalog was constructed by @xcite based on a semi - analytic galaxy formation model of @xcite as updated by @xcite , implemented on the millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "this mock catalog covers a 1.4 @xmath56 1.4 deg@xmath57 field and contains galaxies with stellar mass down to @xmath58   over a wide redshift range ( up to @xmath59 ) , which is suitable for our purpose .",
    "when computing the 2d projected density field , we disturb the redshift of galaxies based on a gaussian distribution with the mean equal to the true redshift of galaxies and width equal to a specified photometric redshift uncertainty .",
    "figure [ fig : sigma ] and figure [ fig : outlier ] show our 2d projected density measurements against the true 3-dimensional local density as a function of redshift precision ( upper panels ) and outlier rate ( lower panels ) respectively . keeping in mind that the overdensity is defined in the 2d plane by projecting galaxies within a finite redshift interval",
    ", it is therefore expected that there would still exist some scatters in the density comparison even in the case of no redshift error , as shown in the 3 left panels of figure [ fig : sigma ] .",
    "as the photometric redshift accuracy worsens , the slope of this relation becomes shallower due to the dilution of the density contrast . as it can be seen , the relation is nearly flat ( slope @xmath240.1 ) and the dynamical range of the 2d overdensity becomes quite small when the photometric redshift error increases to 15% .",
    "in addition , we also study the impact of catastrophic failure of the photometric redshift determination ( i.e. , the redshift outlier ) on the density measurement . for simplicity",
    ", we assign an arbitrary redshift to a certain fraction of randomly selected galaxies . in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : fq - photoz ] ,",
    "we show the 2d vs. 3d density estimates by varying the outlier rate .",
    "overall it is found that the resulting relationship between 2d and 3d measurements do not strongly depend on the outlier rate .",
    "therefore their effect can be ignored in this work .",
    "since the photoz uncertainty yields a shallower slope in the 2d versus 3d density relation , one may expect that the color - density relation can potentially be smeared out if using the photometric redshfit sample . in the following , we make use of the mock galaxy catalog to examine this effect .",
    "for each galaxy in the mock catalog , we first compute their overdensity and then assign a galaxy to be quiescent or star - forming such that the fraction of quiescent galaxies obeys the following formula : @xmath60 where ( 1 + @xmath61 ) is the overdensity measured using the @xmath62 nearest neighbor . the above relation between quiescent fraction and overdensity",
    "is arbitrarily set , and hence may not be representative of the underlying color - density relation predicted by the semi - analytical model used in the mock catalog .",
    "nevertheless , this simplified color - density relation should be sufficient for our purpose of understanding the effect of redshift error .",
    "figure [ fig : fq - photoz ] displays the quiescent fraction as a function of overdensity ( upper panels ) and density percentile ( lower panels ) under various photometric redshift precisions .",
    "we find that the resulting slopes of the  density relation only weakly depend on the redshift error ( upper panels ) .",
    "this is because even though the overdensity is diluted owing to the photo - z error , which leads to a narrower overdensity range in the case of greater photo - z uncertainty , the quiescent fraction for a given overdensity is also being diluted . as a result",
    ", the slope in the density relation remains nearly unaffected since values in both x- and y - axes lessen .",
    "our test suggests that one can still recover the slope of the color - density relation with a photo - z sample at least up to  @xmath63 .    on the other hand , when the density is expressed using their percentage ranks rather than overdensity ( as shown in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : fq - photoz ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that the  density relation becomes much flatter in the presence of photo - z errors .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the range in the @xmath64-axis is reduced whereas the @xmath65range does not change correspondingly . in other words ,",
    "the adoption of the ranked density percentile could lead to the slope of color - density relation being degraded .",
    "therefore , we choose to use the overdensity for our further analysis .",
    "similarly we found that the outlier rate has little effect on the color - density relation when using the overdensity whereas the color - density relation is degraded when using the ranked density .",
    "it is important to note that the aforementioned simulation tests are done based on a uniformly gaussian scatter in the photometric redshift regardless of galaxy types , whereas in a realistic dataset the photometric redshift uncertainties for quiescent galaxies are typically smaller than star - forming galaxies because of their prominent sed ( spectral energy distribution ) features around the balmer break . in order to know how this galaxy - type dependent photometric redshift error can potentially affect our results ,",
    "we repeat above analysis by assigning photometric redshift to quiescent galaxies with the uncertainty 3 times better than the star - forming population . when compared to the mock sample with zero redshift errors",
    ", we find that there is a small excess ( @xmath66 20 % ) in the quiescent fraction in the dentist regions , leading to a slightly higher slope of the  density ( see figure [ fig : fq - photoz ] ) .",
    "this means that our measured slope of the color  density relation can be seen as an upper limit when the slope is positive .",
    "nevertheless , such effect is small and therefore can be negligible in our analysis .",
    "we further test the reliability of our photometric redshift density measurements at higher density and higher redshifts ( @xmath4 ) . in figure",

    "direct comparison among the different works employing different density measurements ( aperture versus nearest - neighbor ) , redshift accuracy ( spectroscopic versus photometric ) , and sample depth is very complicated and beyond the scope of this work .",
    "nevertheless , our work suggests that the discrepancy among different studies may be partly attributed to the redshift and scale dependence of the color - density relation . as we have discussed , the turning point of the color ",
    "density relation appears at redshifts between 1 and 1.5 . as a consequence ,",
    "the slope of the color ",
    "density relation would be sensitive to the redshift range probed . since the galaxy sample of @xcite",
    "is restricted to @xmath98 , as opposed to @xmath99 adopted by @xcite , the reversal of the color ",
    "density relation is naturally not seen by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the work of @xcite , the authors utilized spectroscopic redshifts and computed the overdensity using the @xmath100-nearest neighbor approach .",
    "this roughly corresponds to a median size of @xmath240.5 physical   at @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , despite that @xcite also adopted a comparable aperture size of 0.5 physical   on the projected plane , they need to adopt a larger window in the redshift direction because of the photometric redshift uncertainty , their density fields are in fact measured on a much larger scale .",
    "the combination of the both effects can potentially explain the different results obtained by these two groups .",
    "when moving to redshifts greater than 1.5 , our derived quiescent fraction depends little on the density field , consistent with other recent works which are also based on the cosmos sample @xcite .",
    "however , there is also tentative evidence that the density relation stay inverted out to @xmath101 , although the dynamical range of the density at high redshifts is smaller compared to @xmath102 .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that the current sample size and the survey area are still small .",
    "observations over larger field of view or in other fields are required to confirm the features seen here .",
    "while the local density field has been widely used to explore the effect of the environment on galaxy properties , it does not represent the overarching environments such as voids , filaments , groups and clusters with a one - to - one correspondence .",
    "for instance , the local density in certain area of a filament can be as high as that within a galaxy group , which make it difficult to interpret the effect of the environment in terms of actual physical processes . in the previous section ,",
    "we have probed the dependence of quiescent fraction on local density .",
    "now we turn to the study of the dependence on physical environment ( or halo mass ) .",
    "ideally it is preferable to associate each galaxy to their underlying physical environments and then compare galaxy properties among different environments .",
    "such an approach , however , requires high redshift accuracy for reliable environment constructions . as an alternative",
    ", we perform a clustering analysis of star - forming and quiescent galaxies to probe the hosting halo mass for the two populations respectively .",
    "if the galaxy density field is indeed a good tracer of halo mass , one might well expect the clustering strength for quiescent galaxies to be larger than that of star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 as inferred from the density relation . at @xmath87 , where the density relation is inverted at large scales ,",
    "sf galaxies are expected to have a stronger clustering length than quiescent galaxies do .",
    "we measure the galaxy angular correlation function ( acf ) using data and random catalogs with the estimator proposed by @xcite : @xmath103/rr(\\theta),\\ ] ] where dd(@xmath104 ) , dr(@xmath104 ) , and rr(@xmath104 ) are the number of data - data , data - random and random - random pair counts with separations between @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and @xmath106 and @xmath107 are number of galaxies in the data and random catalogs .",
    "a mask is used to identify bad regions due to saturated stars or cosmic rays that is applied to both the data and random catalogs .",
    "the error bars in each @xmath104 bin are based on the 1@xmath3 poisson statistics of the pair counts in the bins and hence are not correlated across the bins .",
    "we fit our acf with a power law @xmath108 where @xmath109 is fixed to be 1.8 and @xmath110 is the integral constraint which accounts for the finite region of the sky probed in the sample .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the integral constraint using @xmath111 which gives a value of @xmath112 in our case .    in figure [",
    "fig : acf ] , we show the angular correlation function for sf ( blue points ) , quiescent ( red points ) , and the full ( black points ) samples respectively .",
    "quiescent galaxies persistently have a greater clustering amplitude than sf galaxies up to @xmath101 , indicating that quiescent galaxies preferentially live in more massive halos compared to the sf population .",
    "our clustering results for the full and quiescent samples are in good agreement with those from an independent analysis based on the ultravista dr1 data in the cosmos field @xcite , which also found that quiescent galaxies are more strongly clustered than the full sample .",
    "however , we note that the data used in this works incorporate an updated version ( dr2 ) of the ultravista near - infrared survey and splash irac survey , which yield more reliable mass estimates compared to previous photometric redshift catalogs in this field . at @xmath1 , galaxy type dependence of the clustering is consistent with the results from the density analysis shown in  [ sec : fq ] : high - density region provides a higher chance of finding quiescent galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the clustering results seem to disagree with the expectation from the density relation at higher redshifts  at @xmath113 quiescent galaxies are clustered more strongly , while the   has little dependence or is inversely correlated with density . in other words , our results indicate that even if the typical halo mass of quiescent galaxies are generally higher than that of sf galaxies at all redshifts , the galaxy - based density for quiescent galaxies are not necessarily higher .    in fact it has been demonstrated that lower halo masses , in the regime 10@xmath114 - 10@xmath115 , are indiscernible by various density measurements including the nearest - neighbor and aperture methods @xcite . to have a closer look at the relationship between halo mass and galaxy density , we make use of the mock galaxy catalog and plot their distributions in figure [ fig : mock ] . here we fix the stellar mass to be @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively when measuring the overdensity inferred from the @xmath62 nearest neighbor . as it can be seen , although the peak of the density distribution are in general higher for larger halo mass bin , there is a wide spread in density for a given halo mass bin .",
    "moreover , the density distribution becomes degenerate for halos with mass less than @xmath5  , confirming the results found by other works @xcite using different simulations . as we will discuss in the next paragraph ( also see figure [ fig : r0 ] )",
    ", we find that the typical halo mass at @xmath119 is roughly @xmath5   or so , a mass regime below which the local density is no longer a good tracer of halo mass .",
    "the large scatters in the relationship between local density and halo mass may explain the disagreement between the density and clustering analysis at high redshifts .",
    "figure [ fig : r0 ] illustrates the redshift evolution of the correlation length @xmath120 and the inferred mass of the hosting halo based on the @xcite prescription for our sample with @xmath89 .",
    "the star - forming galaxies show an increase in the halo mass with time ( except for the lowest-@xmath121 bin ) .",
    "this trend can possibly be explained by the global growth of the large - scale structures with time , as fractionally more galaxies becomes part of the galaxy groups and clusters as time progresses . on the other hand , the evolution in halo mass is much weaker for the quiescent population .",
    "however , we note that the expected number of clusters more massive than @xmath122   at @xmath123 in a cosmos - like field is @xmath124 .",
    "it is likely that our sample at @xmath123 does not sample enough volume to detect massive halos , resulting in the decline of the typical halo mass for both star - forming and quiescent galaxies from @xmath125 to @xmath126 , as revealed in figure [ fig : r0 ] .",
    "the weaker evolution for the halos hosting quiescent population may therefore be partly attributed to the lack of volume at @xmath123 . at @xmath127 ,",
    "the typical halo mass for quiescent galaxies is @xmath5 , at least one order of magnitude more massive than that for the sf galaxies .",
    "this implies that the quenching mechanism acting in the high - redshift universe may only be effective in massive halos .",
    "using the splash photometric redshift catalog in the cosmos field , we have investigated the environmental effects on galaxy properties by studying the density field and clustering properties of star - forming and quiescent galaxies out to @xmath0 .",
    "we first test the performance of the density recovery with a photometric redshift - like catalog by using a mock galaxy catalog , and study the impact of the photometric redshift uncertainty on the color  density relation .",
    "we then use our density measurements to probe the fraction of quiescent galaxies as a function of density with various scales .",
    "finally we perform clustering analyses for both star - forming and quiescent populations to infer their hosting halo masses . in summary ,",
    "the key results from our analysis are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "extensive simulations show that the color  density relation can still be detectable even if the surface density field is diluted in the presence of photometric redshift errors and catastrophic failures .",
    "however , the slope of the color  density relation depends little on redshift uncertainty when using the overdensity , but would be weakened if using the ranked percentage of density .",
    "we find that the fraction of quiescent galaxies ( ) is a strong function of density field at @xmath1 , being greater in denser environments .",
    "however , the density relation flattens and becomes inverted between @xmath128 and @xmath129 at a 1.6@xmath3 confidence level .",
    "there is also marginal evidence ( < 1.8@xmath3 ) that the slope of density relation is scale dependent at @xmath2 , changing from positive to negative with increasing environment scale .",
    "\\4 . for massive ( > 10@xmath46 ) galaxies",
    ", the quiescent population possess greater correlation lengths than the star - forming population at @xmath131 , indicating that quiescent galaxies preferentially reside in more massive halos compared to star - forming galaxies at a fixed stellar mass .",
    "the lack of density dependence of quiescent fraction , together with the clear difference in the clustering strength ( and thus halo mass ) seen between quiescent and star - forming galaxies , suggest that halo mass is a more fundamental parameter in suppressing the star formation in galaxies , as opposed to the density field in the high - redshift universe .",
    "one interesting result from this work is that the -density relation does not only reverse its trend at @xmath36 , but the slope of this relation is also scale dependent , inverted on larger scales when adopting finer redshift bins in the redshift range of @xmath2 .",
    "the higher passive fraction seen in large - scale underdense environments at @xmath36 is somewhat unexpected and not predicted in galaxy formation models @xcite , particularly because the quiescent fraction is sensitive to the quenching processes , which are intuitively thought to be more effective in high density environments ( e.g. , galaxy mergers , ram - pressure stripping , strangulations , etc ) .",
    "we note , however , that the cease of star formation requires cold gas to be completely removed , consumed , or heated to a higher temperature .",
    "if new cold gas can be replenished into the galaxy after quenching occurred , the galaxy can not remain quiescent forever .",
    "galaxies located in the denser part of the cosmic web where cold gas is more abundant may regain their gas through the cold accretion mode more easily .",
    "on the the hand , the positive -density relation seen on small scales implies that the quenching process subject to the local environment similar to local universe is still in act at @xmath36 . in other words",
    ", there are two competing environmental effects for galaxies located in high - density regions , where both quenching and the revival of star formation are more efficient .",
    "however , we stress that the reversal of the -density relation is only detected at a 1.5@xmath3 level .",
    "a larger dataset would be required to improve the statistics .    at @xmath132",
    "there is no significant density dependence of the quiescent fraction , in contrast to the halo mass dependence .",
    "as discussed in  5 , this can be mostly attributed to the fact that at high redshifts , most of the massive relaxed clusters whose density fields are distinct from those of smaller halos , had not had enough time to develop and that there is fairly large scatter in the relationship between the density field and halo mass for less massive halos ( < @xmath5 ) . in other words , there is only weak one - to - one correspondence between the density field and halo mass for our high - redshift sample . furthermore , even if the extreme but rare environments do exist , they may be either missing owing to the small field size used in this work , or are at different stages of virialization from their local counterpart .",
    "therefore the environment effects we see for high - redshift sample may exclude the quenching processes that only operate in very massive clusters as those seen at low redshifts .",
    "theoretical works predict that halos more massive than @xmath133   can form hot gaseous halo via virial shock @xcite . in the presence of heating sources , such as agn or radio - mode feedback , the hot gas fail to cool efficiently and thus prevent further star formation in galaxies .",
    "this type of quenching mechanism is often referred as ` halo quenching ' . under this paradigm",
    ", it has been shown that the hot gas fraction increases with halo mass @xcite .",
    "if we believe star formation quenching efficiency to be directly related to the hot gas fraction , it is then expected that the quiescent fraction of galaxies would also be a strong function of halo mass . in this study , we show that at @xmath134 , the typical halo mass hosting the quiescent galaxies is @xmath5 , relatively higher compared to that of star - forming galaxies , suggesting that massive halos are more likely to provide conditions that maintain the quenched state of galaxies .",
    "this is in line with the aforementioned halo quenching picture in which the quenching efficiency is higher for more massive halos .",
    "we caution that the number of quiescent galaxies at higher redshifts in our sample is still very limited , which leads to large statistical error bars especially in extreme environments .",
    "wider and deeper surveys such as the hypersuprimecam survey ( hsc ) combined with the splash program will increase the sample size of quiescent galaxies , and push the analysis to fainter populations .",
    "the increased statistics will in turn allow the hosting halo mass to be better constrained by the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) analysis .",
    "furthermore , the upcoming large spectroscopic surveys , such as prime focus survey ( pfs ) on subaru , will allow us to construct the cosmic web by identifying a broad range of environments ( from voids , filaments , groups , to clusters ) and provide direct evidence for the environmental effects in the high - redshift universe .",
