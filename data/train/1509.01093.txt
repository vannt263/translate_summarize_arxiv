    "chimera states have been extensively studied over the last decade in natural and artificial networks of coupled identical complex systems , in fields ranging from physics and chemistry to biology and engineering @xcite . at the outset , kuramoto and his colleagues",
    "@xcite first noticed that in a system of non - locally coupled identical phase oscillators , in a ring configuration , the system spontaneously broke the underlying symmetry and split into synchronized and desynchronized oscillator groups .",
    "namely , there emerged a state where coherent and incoherent sets of oscillators co - existed .",
    "this state was dubbed a chimera state @xcite , as it was reminiscent of the greek mythological creature composed of incongruous parts .",
    "subsequently this fascinating phenomena has been observed in a variety of non - locally coupled systems , such as time delayed systems @xcite , josephson junction arrays @xcite , electrochemical systems @xcite and uni - hemispheric sleep in certain animals @xcite . in recent years chimera states",
    "have also been observed experimentally in optical analogs of coupled map lattices @xcite , belousov - zhabotinsky chemical oscillator systems @xcite , two populations of mechanical metronomes @xcite and modified time delay electronic circuit systems @xcite .    till now chimera states have been reported primarily in networks that have a regular ring topology , where oscillators are coupled in a non - local @xcite or global fashion @xcite . in this work",
    "we will show how chimera states also emerge in _ oscillator networks with a star topology_. the star configuration is one where the network has a central hub position and all other nodes are linked to this node @xcite .",
    "this configuration arises extensively in computer networks , where every node connects to a central computer , and the central computer act as a server and the peripheral devices act as clients .",
    "further , a star - like structure is a primary motif in scale - free networks , which have been reported to arise in wide - ranging phenomena @xcite .    here",
    "we will show the extensive existence of chimeras in the end - nodes of the star network , which are identical in terms of the coupling environment and dynamical equations .",
    "we will demonstrate how the symmetry of the end - nodes is broken and co - existing groups with different dynamical behaviour emerge .",
    "interestingly we find that such chimera states are very wide - spread in this network topology , and large parameter regimes of coupling strengths typically yield a chimera state .",
    "we also confirm the existence of robust chimera states in analog circuit experiments .",
    "here we study the dynamics of a star network of @xmath0 identical nonlinear oscillator systems . in such networks",
    "there is one central hub node ( labelled by site index @xmath1 ) and @xmath2 environmentally identical peripheral end - nodes connected to the central node ( labelled by node index @xmath3 ) .",
    "one can also interpret this system as a set of uncoupled oscillators connected to a common drive .",
    "the focus of this study is the dynamical patterns arising in the @xmath2 identical end - nodes of this network . in order to establish the generality of our results ,",
    "we consider three different coupling forms : ( a ) diffusive coupling ( b ) conjugate coupling and ( c ) mean - field coupling .",
    "we give below the general dynamical equations for the different coupling forms .",
    "first , we consider standard diffusive coupling through similar variables , given by : @xmath4 here coupling matrix element for central node @xmath5 is @xmath6 when @xmath7 , and for the end - nodes @xmath3 , @xmath8 and zero otherwise .",
    "the coupling strength is given by @xmath9 .",
    "then we consider the _ conjugate coupling _ @xcite given as : @xmath10 lastly , we also consider a mean - field type of coupling , where the dynamics of the central node is given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mean field of the end - nodes .",
    "the dynamics of the end - nodes @xmath13 is given by : @xmath14    for the local dynamics at the nodes , we take two prototypical chaotic systems that have widespread relevance in modelling phenomena ranging from lasers to circuits .",
    "first we consider the rssler type oscillator at node @xmath15 , given by the form : @xmath16{y_{i } } - { z_i}\\\\ \\nonumber      f_y ( x_{i } , y_i , z_i)&=&[\\omega_{i } + \\epsilon({x_{i}}^{2}+{y_{i}}^{2})]{x_{i } } + a y_{i}\\\\ \\nonumber      f_z ( x_{i } , y_i , z_i)&=&b + z_{i}(x_{i } - c )      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eqns . 1 - 4 . for each node , @xmath17 is close to the angular velocity of the @xmath18 oscillator , perturbed by amplitude @xmath19 when @xmath20 .",
    "here we take the parameter values to be : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite , yielding a chaotic attractor .",
    "we also consider the lorenz system at the nodes given by : @xmath26 in eqns . 1 - 4 .",
    "with no loss of generality we consider the parameters of the local system to be @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , yielding double - scroll attractors .",
    "we study both these chaotic systems , coupled in star network configuration , through the different coupling forms given above .",
