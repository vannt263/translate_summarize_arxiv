    "from a statistical physics point of view , opinion formation is similar to epidemic or forest fire spreading , landslide , crystal growth , fracture , percolation and pertains to the abundant literature on phase transition studies .",
    "the modeling of such phenomena , i.e. for reproducing stylized features , is highly important in order to connect statistical physics with the socio - economic world .",
    "some conceptual difficulty has been resolved due to the abandon of ( bravais or random ) lattice based concepts in favor of studies of cases on more elaborate networks in which the statistical characteristics , like the number of sites , neighbors , distances , weights and directivity of links are not trivial .",
    "euler invented network theory @xcite , for the knigsberg ( or kaliningrad ) bridge crossing problem , in the 1780s , but this subject remained a form of abstract mathematics .",
    "graph theory was born later to study similar problems , including molecular bonding @xcite .",
    "an increased interest in the topics can be registered during the last decade , particularly due to their potential for an apparently quite unbounded area of applications .",
    "indeed , the inter - disciplinary ( or rather trans - disciplinary ) concept of `` network '' is frequently met in all scientific research areas @xcite , its covering field spanning from computer science to medicine and social psychology , e.g. see some work in classical random graph study @xcite , non - equilibrium growing networks @xcite , www and internet structure properties @xcite , social networks of scientific collaborations @xcite , paper citations @xcite , collective listening habits and music genres @xcite , language @xcite , and even finance @xcite .",
    "relevant questions pertain to the critical dynamics of properties , not only on the network , but also about the network structure itself .",
    "recent results on the dynamics of social networks @xcite suggest the occurrence of phase transitions in a large class of models @xcite .",
    "this is similar to percolation and nucleation - growth problems .    as a paradigm for large - scale networks , colleagues often consider co - authorship or citation networks @xcite , namely networks where nodes represent scientists , and where a link is drawn between them",
    "if they co - authored a common paper or cite some paper .",
    "other examples , where a system ( nodes ) has an evolution between two phases on a network are the unanimity rule on random networks @xcite . lattice based cases for social evolutions are on the contrary numerous , like prey - predator problems @xcite .",
    "let us stress that the identification of the mechanisms responsible for diffusion and , possibly leading to scientific avalanches @xcite is primordial in a very general sense in order to understand the scientific response to external political decisions , and to develop efficient policy recommendations .",
    "it is important to point that science spreading is usually modeled by master equations with auto - catalytic processes @xcite , or by epidemic models on static networks @xcite . in this article , however , we present a novel approach where the opinion formation and spreading is controlled by a triggering field and occurs only if a threshold is reached . without going into comparative details",
    "the model can be thought to be connected to epidemic @xcite and forest fire spreading @xcite , and landslide @xcite .",
    "however the process as discussed here below occurring on a network seems to be novel and of crucial interest and differs from already known models like the galam @xcite and/or sznajd @xcite model and their extensions .",
    "we focus on the development of neighbouring ( scientific or not ) `` opinions '' in the course of time , thereby eyeing the spreading of ideas in the scientific community .",
    "we will indicate the possibility of variants .    for our present framework ,",
    "let us recall that two decades ago people looked at forest fires @xcite in particular in the case when a tree is ignited only if a neighbouring tree burns long enough .",
    "this fact that wet wood does not yet burn corresponds to our awareness below the threshold @xmath0 .",
    "we also agree that avalanche problems are similar to epidemics with threshold , see a recent paper @xcite , when there is some self - organized information propagation , restricted to realistic `` social '' constraints . finally no need to repeat that most of the ideas here below developed can encompass many networks , not only those formed by scientists .",
    "let a network be given and statistically characterized by a number @xmath1 of nodes ( also called sites ) and a number @xmath2 of links ; as usual one call @xmath3 the degree of the node @xmath4 , i.e. the number of links attached to the node @xmath4 .",
    "the network considered below is chosen to be a so called erds - rnyi network , i.e. each node @xmath4 @xmath5 has a probability equal to @xmath6 to be connected to another node @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "studies on other networks are opened investigations .",
    "each site @xmath4 can be considered to be an agent , e.g. a scientist or not , which has an @xmath9 @xmath10 about an opinion ; @xmath10 is hereby taken from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 at time @xmath11 ; this can be modified in further studies , so",
    "is the number of opinions    suppose that there is a predefined threshold of opinion @xmath0 at time @xmath11 , ( @xmath12 , here to reduce the number of parameters in the model ; this can be modified in further papers as well ) .",
    "when some @xmath10 is above the threshold we consider that the site / agent spreads its _ awareness _ over its neighbors , as should be intuitively the case practically . notice that in view of the hypothesis on the initial distribution of @xmath10 s here above , no spontaneous spreading occurs at @xmath11 , in this paper . some triggering is needed .",
    "consider that due to some cause , at time @xmath13 , a randomly chosen site has an increase of awareness such that @xmath14 .",
    "the initial _ increase of awareness _",
    "value @xmath15 could be chosen in many various ways , i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath16 dependent ; let it be a forever constant in the present discussion .",
    "we consider that the spreading dynamics of the awareness could be restricted to a ( to be decided in later variants ) number @xmath17 of nodes which have necessarily an awareness below the threshold . in the following",
    "we let @xmath17 be all nearest neighbor nodes which are not yet aware .",
    "some of these @xmath17 neighbors , due to the incoming information @xmath18 from @xmath4 , may reach the awareness threshold @xmath0 ; next , these , newly fully aware sites ( agents ) also spread @xmath19 , during the same time step , again to their own neighbors which have an awareness below threshold .",
    "the process can go one and lasts until none of the newly aware neighbor sites goes above the threshold ; thus this avalanche stops .",
    "we define the @xmath20 of the ( first ) @xmath21 as the number of nodes ( here @xmath22 ) which have been reached by the @xmath19 spreading ; the @xmath23 of the avalanche is the number of `` levels '' , away from the original site , i.e. @xmath24 which has been encountered in order to reach this stop during the time step .",
    "sometimes this avalanche size is the number of nodes @xmath1 in the network ; in such a case the time duration of the avalanche is @xmath25 .",
    "however it is possible that the process stops even though not all nodes have been `` infected '' by the spreading opinion , but there is a new awareness value distribution in the network ; these are new `` initial conditions '' .",
    "we let the dynamical process repeat itself , under the same rules : one arbitrary but a _ not fully aware _",
    "node @xmath26 is picked up ; its awareness is increased @xmath27 , for simplicity through the same @xmath15 value which led to the first triggering ; we insist that we consider that the same @xmath15 value is used in order to reduce the number of parameters , but this can also be modified in further studies .",
    "since there is a new time origin for the subsequent process , it is useful to introduce a notation @xmath28 labeling the number of times a triggering has been activated ; the value @xmath29 indicates the second sequence in time ( @xmath30 ) for which there is an external ( or not ) @xmath31 ( implying a @xmath15 ) which modifies the opinion awareness of some site , here @xmath26 .",
    "thereafter , the spreading goes on again with the same rules as above up to the network is so called _ fully aware _ ,",
    "i.e. when all nodes have @xmath32 . in",
    "so doing one can measure for a given @xmath1 , @xmath15 and @xmath6 ( and for this @xmath0 )    1 .",
    "the size of each avalanche 2 .",
    "the time duration of each avalanche 3 .",
    "the number of times the external field is applied to one possible node before all nodes are found to be above the threshold 4 .   which is equivalent to ... the number of avalanches @xmath33 before all nodes are above the threshold 5 .",
    "the number of times the external field is added before an avalanche starts 6 .",
    "the number of nodes still below the threshold at each time step 7 .   the number of hot nodes ( close to threshold ) at each time step .",

    "according to @xcite , catastrophic events share characteristic nonlinear behaviors that are often generated by cross - scale interactions and feedbacks among system elements .",
    "these events result in surprises that can not easily be predicted based on information obtained at a single scale @xcite .",
    "progress on catastrophic events has focused on one of the following two areas : nonlinear dynamics through time without an explicit consideration of spatial connectivity @xcite or spatial connectivity and the spread of contagious processes without a consideration of cross - scale interactions and feedbacks @xcite .",
    "the process dynamics should be correlated with the structure of the network , i.e. to some law , sometimes through the exponents characterizing the latter .    in this paper",
    "we have concentrated on a network of ( scientific or more generally opinion ) communication and looked into the phenomena of related avalanches .",
    "it is intuitively known that ( opinions like scientific ) ones occur as a avalanches spreading out of ( fashion , paradigm ) topics through ( scientific ) communities , in use of tools and instruments in scientific communities or in the sudden increase in cooperation structures ( co - authorship , conferences ) @xcite . here",
    "we have presented an original model implying some spreading of information after triggering and excitation of some node over an awareness threshold .",
    "this should be put in line with considerations on driven threshold systems which are now used to model sand piles , earthquakes , magnetic depinning transitions and driven foams @xcite , etc .",
    "usually on lattices .",
    "indeed the model is reminiscent of the original btw sand pile model @xcite as applied in recent papers on a lattice @xcite or on a network @xcite though the present pile toppling conditions differs from the usual ones , - which are related to the number of neighbors , usually a fixed integer . here",
    "the node  number of grains  is a continuous function , there is no toppling but some effect occurs when the height of the pile reaches a threshold @xmath63 of the number of neighbors .    on the other hand ,",
    "the connectivity of a landscape can influence the dynamics of disturbances , e.g. in internet ( or neural or biological ) epidemics and/or fire extension problems @xcite . thus networks should be investigated .",
    "a question raised is often that whether the spatial pattern rather than the disturbance dynamics ( ordinarily ) determines the total extent of a single disturbance event .",
    "we have shown that , for a erds - rnyi network , a fixed _ a priori _ disturbance perfectly scales the evolution process , in time @xmath64 in space .",
    "we have found evolution laws similar , though with different exponents , to those found in other problems , e.g. even in earthquake dynamics @xcite . as an example recall , the frequency of spinodal fluctuations @xmath65 of area @xmath52 , which are realized here as clusters of excited nodes above a threshold , given by the fisher - stauffer relation @xcite , @xmath66^{1/\\sigma_s}a\\right].\\ ] ] where the interesting exponent @xmath67 is the surface exponent .",
    "the exponent @xmath68 is either @xmath69 or @xmath70 , in terms of the fisher - stauffer exponent @xmath69 which characterizes the fluctuations about the spinodal or describes the frequency of `` arrested '' nucleation events , respectively . here above",
    "we find @xmath71 , @xmath72 , - somewhat unspectacular results , because of the type of network being studied @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the sequence of avalanches much varies from one simulation case to another .",
    "however the @xmath73 dependence on @xmath6 disappears following case averaging , and only the @xmath15 dependence remains in a scaling way .",
    "another aspect which might be also theoretically interesting is the relation between dynamic changes of the network and dynamics on the network . in science , and",
    "in many other interacting agent communities , diffusion of ideas is linked to the emergence of coalitions @xcite .",
    "what predictions complex network theory can make for the coupling between epidemics , in a wide sense , on networks and the evolution of networks themselves is clearly of interest ! the main challenge after this will be to make use of the various qualitative descriptions science and technology studies have produced describing such phenomena and to re - consider them in the light of complex network research , - through the parameters and variants that we have indicated . at this time , the results seem qualitatively sound .",

    "<S> based on a theoretical model for opinion spreading on a network , through avalanches , the effect of external field is now considered , by using methods from non - equilibrium statistical mechanics . the original part contains the implementation that the avalanche is only triggered when a local variable ( a so called awareness ) reaches and goes above a threshold . </S>",

    "<S> several results are obtained for a erds - rnyi network and interpreted through simple analytical laws , scale free or logistic map - like , i.e. , ( i ) the sizes , durations , and number of avalanches , including the respective distributions , ( ii ) the number of times the external field is applied to one possible node before all nodes are found to be above the threshold , ( iii ) the number of nodes still below the threshold and the number of hot nodes ( close to threshold ) at each time step . </S>"
