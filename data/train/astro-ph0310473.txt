    "a large correlation between the temperature and e - type polarization at large angular scale ( low @xmath2 ) was recently observed by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite .",
    "this is a unique signature of re - scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons at redshifts relatively low compared with that of the last - scattering surface at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the required optical depth of @xmath4 can be achieved if reionization occurs at a redshift of @xmath5 .",
    "although there are theoretical uncertainties , such a reionization redshift is difficult to reconcile with the star - formation history expected in the @xmath6cdm model @xcite , which generally favors a reionization redshift of 712 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the thermal history of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) contains further evidence for late completion of reionization @xcite .",
    "this potential conflict between the evidence for early and late reionization might be partially resolved in the double - reionization model , where an early generation of massive , metal - free stars were formed and partly ionized the universe @xcite . nevertheless , even in this model , it is not easy to achieve such a high optical depth @xcite .    in light of this , it is worthwhile to consider possible alternatives .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that a high optical depth might be achieved if primordial density fluctuations are non - gaussian @xcite .",
    "here we consider another option . while stellar photons must have contributed to reionization , it remains possible that other energy sources also contribute .",
    "decay of an unstable particle , for example , provides such an alternative energy source . in this scenario ,",
    "a decaying particle , possibly part of the dark matter , releases energy during its decay , which contributes to the ionization of the igm .",
    "another widely discussed possibility is the radiative decay of an active neutrino , which might play a role in a number of astrophysical phenomena @xcite .",
    "although the parameters of the original model are now excluded by observations @xcite , there are still other regions of decaying - neutrino parameter space , and there is no lack of other particle - physics candidates ; e.g. , unstable supersymmetric particles @xcite , cryptons @xcite , r - parity violating gravitinos @xcite , moduli dark matter @xcite , superheavy dark - matter particles @xcite , axinos @xcite , sterile neutrinos @xcite , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) decaying to superweakly interacting massive particles(swimps ) @xcite , and quintessinos @xcite .",
    "recently , hansen and haiman @xcite suggested sterile - neutrino decay as a source of reionization .",
    "in addition to decaying particles , evaporation of primordial black holes @xcite and decay of topological defects such as cosmic strings and monopoles are also possible source of extra energy input .",
    "the decay of an unstable particle may also help explain the presence of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the local group , resolve the cuspy halo problem in @xmath6cdm models @xcite , and serve as a possible source of the ultra high energy cosmic rays @xcite .    from a cosmological perspective , it is particularly interesting to consider the rich variety of ionization histories offered by the particle - decay scenario . in these scenarios ,",
    "the universe is not necessarily fully ionized ; instead , particle decay may ionize only a small fraction of the gas . if the process lasts for a large range of redshifts , it may still contribute a large fraction of the measured free - electron optical depth .",
    "the presence of a not significantly damped first acoustic peak in the cmb anisotropy spectrum suggests that particle decay should not significantly delay the recombination process at @xmath7 @xcite , but is it possible that the universe become partially ionized during the cosmic `` dark ages '' at redshifts of ten to a few hundred ? what is the observational signature of such an ionization history ?",
    "can this scenario be distinguished from late reionization by cmb observations ?",
    "particle decay may also produce energetic photons ; can observation of cosmic @xmath1-ray backgrounds place constraints on this scenario ?",
    "in this paper we consider these questions .",
    "since at low redshift stars and quasars emit ionizing photons , and since at the epoch of recombination there is no significant increase of entropy , we shall focus mostly on particle decays in the redshift range between 1000 and 20 .",
    "such particles produce an optical depth @xmath8 by partially reionizing the universe at redshifts much higher than the value , @xmath9 , required if the universe becomes fully ionized by early star formation .",
    "we calculate the cmb temperature / polarization power spectra induced by this alternative ionization history and show that it can be distinguished from the full - reionization scenario with the same @xmath10 . in some regions of the decay - particle parameter space , the induced power spectra conflict with those observed already , but there are other regions where decaying particles can provide the required optical depth and maintain consistency with the measured power spectra .    while investigating decaying particles as contributors to cosmic reionization , it becomes clear that new cmb constraints to the ionization history provide new constraints to the parameter space for decaying particles . to a first approximation ,",
    "the energy injected by particles that decay with lifetimes between the ages of the universe at recombination and today either gets absorbed by the igm , or it appears in diffuse radiation backgrounds @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "observed radiation backgrounds have traditionally been used to constrain the parameter space that consists of the decay - particle lifetime and density as well as the energy of the decay products .",
    "as we detail below , new cmb constraints to the ionization history can now provide complementary new constraints to the regions of parameter space where the decay energy goes to heating and ionizing the igm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we discuss how energy is dissipated for various decay channels and what fraction of energy is eventually used for ionization , heating the gas , or carried away by escaping photons and neutrino .",
    "we also discuss how this energy is deposited as a function of redshift . in section iii ,",
    "we describe how to calculate the ionization history and cmb anisotropy with extra energy input from decaying particles , and we discuss how the result depends on the property of the particle . in section iv , we obtain constraints to the decay - particle parameter space from the cmb and diffuse backgrounds .",
    "we summarize our results in section v.",
    "depending on the nature of the decaying particle , the decay products may include gauge bosons , charged leptons , neutrinos , quarks , or other more exotic particles .",
    "these particles may then subsequently decay further into other particles , or they may interact with particles in the igm . with sufficient energy , a shower of particles is created . in the end ,",
    "stable , weakly - interacting particles like neutrinos escape , while other particles lose a significant part of their energy during the interaction with the primordial gas or cosmic microwave background .",
    "some of this energy can go into ionizing the igm , and the efficiency of converting the decay energy to ionization energy is process dependent . here",
    "we review some of the more generic features ; in particular , we consider the efficiency of converting the rest mass of the decaying particle to ionization energy , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the mass of the decaying particle .",
    "in this paper we are mostly interested in the `` dark ages '' , @xmath13 , where most of the gas is neutral .",
    "photons with energy smaller than 13.6 ev can not ionize hydrogen atoms in the ground state , but if there is a large presence of hydrogen atoms in excited states , e.g. at the end of the recombination era , @xmath14 , photons with energy @xmath15 ev may contribute to the ionization .",
    "when most of the atoms fall to the ground state , photons with energy less than 13.6 ev will escape .",
    "ultraviolet and soft x - ray photons with energy @xmath16 have large photoionization cross sections and are largely absorbed locally .",
    "for photons with energy @xmath17 , neutral helium absorption dominates the absorption , and photoelectrons are produced in the process .",
    "the photoelectron carries the remaining energy of the photon . from here on the energy dissipation process for the initial photon is the same as that for an initial energetic electron .",
    "the absorption processes of hard x - ray and @xmath1-ray photons at cosmological distances were discussed in ref .",
    "the processes in which photons can be absorbed or lose energy include ( i ) photoionization of atoms , ( ii ) compton scattering on electrons , ( iii ) production of pairs on atoms , ( iv ) production of pairs on free electrons and free nuclei , ( v ) scattering with background photons , and ( vi ) pair production on background photons . in some of these , such as compton scattering , a photon loses only a small fraction of its energy in a single scattering event , while in others it can lose a significant part of its energy .    in fig",
    ".  [ gloss ] , we plot the total energy - loss rate , @xmath18 as a function of energy for redshifts , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "we assume @xmath21 except for the compton - scattering process . here , @xmath22 is the expansion rate of the universe at redshift @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the density of the target particle  i.e . , neutral hydrogen or helium for ( i ) or ( iii ) , free electrons for ( ii ) or ( iv ) , and cmb photons for ( v ) or ( vi)and @xmath25 is the corresponding cross section . at the high energy ( @xmath26 ) where compton scattering becomes important , a photon is not able to distinguish whether an electron is free or bound , so we assume a free - electron fraction of 0.01 for processes ( i ) , ( iii ) , ( iv ) , but treat all electrons as free for the compton processes .",
    "our result is not sensitive to the ionization fraction as long as the universe is mostly neutral .",
    "we should also point out that in this discussion we have also neglected any other photon background , e.g. the infrared photon background which might be produced at low redshift .    as we can see from the figure , high - energy photons ( above 1 tev at @xmath27 , 1 gev at @xmath28 ) can scatter with cmb photons or produce pairs , and they are largely absorbed locally , producing either an x - ray photon which has a larger absorption cross section , or an electron - positron pair with high energy .    for photons with energy around 1 gev ( and around 1 kev at low redshift ) ,",
    "the universe is optically thin in the redshift range which we are interested in , photons lose most of their energy by redshifting , only a small fraction of the total energy is transfered to gas by scattering , and the scattering occurs over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "the details of the energy distribution depend on the injection energy and redshift of the photon .",
    "the formation of an electromagnetic shower and the resulting spectrum was investigated for both low redshift @xcite and the early universe @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the shower is of the form @xmath29 below the threshold energy , with @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "[ gcontour ] shows the transparency window . in the dark regions , @xmath31 (",
    "i.e. , most of the photon energy goes to the igm ) , and in the white regions @xmath32 ( i.e. , the universe is transparent to these photons ) .",
    "the bump in the transparency window at ( @xmath33)=(5.7 , 2.16 ) is due to the compton scattering .",
    "if the photon is injected in the transparency window , and remains in the transparency window as its energy redshifts ( once a photon is injected it travels down and to the left on this plot ) , then it will free stream and appear in diffuse radiation backgrounds with energies @xmath34kev10 tev ; otherwise , it will not appear as a diffuse background , but will heat and ionize the igm . also keep in mind that the time interval @xmath35 .",
    "thus , if a particle decays with lifetime longer than the age of the universe , the relevant redshift for determining whether it appears in diffuse backgrounds is @xmath36 . in section",
    "iv below , we will give constraints to the decay - particle parameter space under two extreme assumptions : ( 1 ) that all the photon energy goes into the igm , and ( 2 ) that the photons free stream and appear as diffuse backgrounds .",
    "[ gcontour ] must then be consulted to determine which limit applies for a particular decay - photon energy and lifetime .    what we need to know for the ionization history is what fraction of the energy is converted to ionization energy , and how it is distributed over redshift .",
    "in the optically - thick case  i.e . for photons outside the transparency window",
    " we can assume that the energy is instantly deposited .",
    "the energy deposition rate ( in units of @xmath37 ) is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mass of the decaying particle , and @xmath40 the decay rate . if the lifetime of the particle is much longer than the age of the universe and @xmath41 is constant , then @xmath42 .    in the optically - thin case ,",
    "the efficiency is much lower .",
    "local absorption is neglible , and a flux of high - energy photons is produced .",
    "these photons may interact with baryons by photoionization , compton scattering , and pair creation , and with cosmic - radiation - background photons by photon - photon scattering . after interaction ,",
    "the energy is transferred to the electrons , positrons , and ions which have stronger interactions with other particles , or to photons with much smaller energy and greater optical depth .",
    "here we make the following approximation : once a scattering happens at redshift @xmath23 , the energy carried by the photon at that redshift is completely deposited with some efficiency .",
    "this seems to be a good approximation , since the electrons and lower - energy photons produced in the scattering event have much greater optical depths .",

    "for example , if the decay products are two photons , @xmath50 . in other cases ,",
    "the photon may not have a single energy , but still it is expected the energy of the photon is related to the mass of the decaying particle and has a narrow range .",

    "the redshift dependence is stronger due to the additional factor of @xmath61 in the cross section .",
    "an electron can collide with and ionize atoms , or it can inverse - compton scatter cmb photons , a process that produces an energetic photon . those photons will be absorbed again , starting an electromagnetic shower .",

    "thus , if the injected electron has an energy in this `` electron transparency window , '' the decay energy will escape and appear in diffuse photon backgrounds , and will not transfer most of its energy to the igm .    for the case where the electron does heat the igm , the partition of the energy among ionization , excitation , and heating was investigated by shull and van steenberg @xcite .",
    "they found that when the gas is mostly neutral , about 1/3 of the energy goes to ionization , about the same amount goes into excitation , and the rest heats the igm .",
    "for a fully ionized medium , almost all of the energy goes into heating the gas .",
    "therefore , we can approximate the fraction of energy going into ionization as , @xmath79 this approximation is crude but sufficiently accurate for our purposes .",
    "if the energy of the initial electron is still higher , @xmath80 , it can scatter with another photon or electron and produce an electron - positron pair .",
    "the electron and positron then lose energy through inverse - compton scattering or ionization , the positron eventually annihilates with another electron and produces @xmath81 photons .",
    "to summarize , roughly one - third the decay energy goes locally into ionization , and the rest into heating the gas , unless the electron is injected in the transparency window gev@xmath82 tev , in which case most of the energy is carried away by upscattered cmb photons .      _ protons _ are very penetrating particles and thus are not effective in transferring decay energy to the igm .",

    "as it turns out , for the @xmath171 and @xmath167 models this produces too large a deviation during the recombination era which could easily be ruled out , so for the @xmath171 and @xmath167 models we increase @xmath131 by a factor of 100 .",
    "the ionization fraction , temperature , and optical depth are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : longpowrec ] .    for the cases with @xmath172 , the additional redshift dependence @xmath173 makes the ionization energy redshift away .",
    "this means that if we adopt parameters which do not spoil standard recombination , the effect on low redshift ionization must be very small . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : longpow ] , this does not help explain the wmap result .    from the above discussion , it seems that models with @xmath174 may produce results which are more consistent with the wmap data .",
    "for example , the @xmath175 model tends to have relatively large effect at lower @xmath2 .",
    "if , for example , the decaying particle is somehow associated with the dark energy which has a redshift dependence of @xmath176 , then the @xmath175 model might be realized .",
    "thus , we have investigated the ionization history and cmb for a variety of models .",
    "it appears long - lifetime models may help produce the large te polarization at low @xmath2 .",
    "short life time models and models with additional redshift dependence typically work less well , except for particles or other energy sources whose density decrease slower than ordinary matter .",
    "so far we have illustrated the effect of particles decay during the dark ages with several examples .",
    "we now use measurements of the cmb power spectra and diffuse backgrounds to place constraints to the decay - particle parameter space .",
    "we first consider cmb constraints .",
    "we suppose that all of the decay energy is deposited instantly into the igm , which then reionizes the universe and changes the cmb power spectrum as described above . for each set of model parameters @xmath40 and @xmath131 we calculate @xmath177 for the wmap tt and te spectrum .",
    "we have 1403 tt and te data points .",
    "the @xmath177 distribution for 1403 degrees of freedom has a a width of about 50 , so the @xmath178 limit is defined by the line @xmath179 .",
    "the result is shown as the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : concmb ] ; regions above the curve are ruled out .",
    "note that these results do _ not _ apply if the particle decays to photons or electrons in the transparency window , as in these cases , the decay energy will not be deposited in the igm but will instead propagate freely and appear in the diffuse radiation backgrounds .    in this case",
    ", the @xmath131-@xmath40 parameter space can be constrained from measurements of diffuse backgrounds @xmath36 .",
    "the flux of decay radiation is then given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluxdelta ] ) . with @xmath36 .",
    "we then obtain bounds to the particle density and decay lifetime , @xmath180 where @xmath181 .",
    "we now apply this result to the x - ray and @xmath1-ray backgrounds .",
    "the observed cosmic x - ray background ( in units of @xmath182 ) can be modeled as @xcite @xmath183    the @xmath1-ray background was measured by the the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) . at about 100 mev , the flux is @xmath184 .",
    "a fit for the whole energy range of @xmath185 was @xcite @xmath186    more recent re - analysis found a greater galactic background , and therefore the extra - galactic background is lowered @xcite .",
    "of course , distant quasars and stars also contribute to this background , so here we use the measured background eq .",
    "( [ eq : gobs ] ) as a conservative upper limit .",
    "at each photon energy @xmath54 , given the background flux @xmath187 , we can derive a bound on @xmath188 for each decay photon energy @xmath189 by applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluxobs ] ) to the flux ( with the restriction that the maximum redshift to be less than @xmath14 ) .",
    "we run through the energy range of @xmath190 , at each energy using the flux limits given in eqs.([eq : fluxobs ] ) and ( [ eq : gobs ] ) to derive a bound , and look for the most restrictive constraint on @xmath191 for all energies .",
    "as expected , except for short - lived particles , the constraint comes mainly from emission at @xmath36 .",
    "the results for decay photon in the transparency window @xmath192 , @xmath193 , are plotted as @xmath194 in fig .",
    "[ fig : conxgb ] . on the same figure we also plot the corresponding values of today , @xmath195 . in terms of the decaying particle at radiation - matter equality , particles with short lifetimes",
    "are less constrained than the ones with long lifetimes .",
    "however , we do not expect any of these short - lifetime particles to remain today , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conxgb ] .",
    "depending on the energy of the observed photon , the diffuse x - ray and @xmath1-ray background constraints are generally more stringent than the cmb constraint except for short - lived particles .",
    "one must remember , however , that the cmb constraint applies only outside the transparency window , whereas the @xmath1-ray constraint applies in the transparency window .",
    "in this paper we have investigated particle decay during the dark ages .",
    "such particle decay could induce partial ionization of the universe , and thus provide a potential alternative to early star formation as an explanation for the wmap te measurement .",
    "we considered how the decay energy is converted to ionization energy .",
    "we conclude that in many cases , a shower of electrons and x - ray photons are produced , in which case a sizable fraction ( @xmath196 ) of the energy can be converted to ionization energy _ in situ _ , with comparable amount of energy going into heating the gas . however , there are important exceptions",
    ". photons in the energy range @xmath197 can escape , carrying with them most of the energy .",
    "electrons in the energy range @xmath198 lose most of their energy by inverse - compton scattering cmb photons into the above energy range . in these cases the ionization energy is deposited over a range of redshifts , and the energy deposition is proportional to @xmath199 , where @xmath24 is the density of target particles , which can be baryons or the cmb photons .",
    "because of the small value of the optical depth @xmath170 , the decay rate must be very large to affect ionization .",
    "we can study reionization in these models by considering additional @xmath61 dependence . in most cases , though , the models will be ruled out , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : conxgb ] , by diffuse backgrounds .    the extra energy input from particle decays can be parameterized by the ionization energy input parameter @xmath200 ( @xmath131 has the unit of @xmath201 ) , where @xmath41 is the efficiency , @xmath202 , and @xmath40 the decay rate .",
    "if the lifetime of the decaying particle is longer than the age of the universe , the situation is particularly simple since the result depends entirely on @xmath131 . for short - lived particles",
    ", one must specify both @xmath40 and @xmath131 .",
    "we studied the ionization history and cmb temperature and polarization anisotropy for different cases .",
    "although particle decays could partially ionize the universe at high redshift and produce a high optical depth , we found that in most cases they do not reproduce the wmap result very well .",
    "the te polarization does not peak at @xmath203 but at @xmath144 , for example .",
    "we should pointed out however , this is not a unique problem with particle - decay induced reionization , but is also seen in other models with extended partial reionization history .",
    "we also found that the ee spectrum is a sensitive probe to the ionization history .",
    "furthermore , if reionization occurs at high redshift , there is a change in the shape and position of the acoustic peaks .",
    "the ionization history is affected if the extra energy input has additional dependence on the redshift .",
    "typically , for an additional redshift dependence of @xmath173 with @xmath204 , the fit to cmb data is not improved , because the extra energy input at early times will spoil recombination .",
    "models with @xmath174 may be helpful , but some exotic mechanism is needed for generating such a redshift dependence .",
    "we have obtained constraints on particle decays during the dark ages using the wmap data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : concmb ] .",
    "we found @xmath205 for the long - lifetime case , and a slightly weaker bound for the short - lifetime case .",
    "however , the short - lived particles decay at high redshift and we do not expect to see any left today .",
    "we also obtained constraints on the decaying particle from the observed diffuse x - ray and @xmath1-ray backgrounds .",
    "this constraint is generally more stringent than the cmb constraint , but it actually applies to a different situation ; i.e. the decay products are mainly photons in the energy range of the transparency window , where they can propagate freely across the universe and contribute very little energy to ionization .",
    "the extra energy input also heats up the igm during the dark age , and the temperature can rise to @xmath206 k. inverse - compton scattering of free electrons can induce distortion in the cmb blackbody spectrum , but the effect is unobservably small ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "if the dark - matter particle can decay , it may affect the estimation of cosmological parameters . to see how each parameter is affected",
    ", we can calculate the correlation matrix , which is related to the covariance matrix @xcite by @xmath208 where the covariance matrix is given by the inverse of the fisher matrix @xmath209 , with @xmath210,\\ ] ] and @xmath211 are the cosmological parameters to be estimated .",
    "we plot @xmath212 in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] .    in making fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] , we have taken a fiducial model with the wmap best fits with the exception @xmath213 which corresponds to a sudden reionization with @xmath214 .",
    "choosing different fiducial models may affect the error estimates slightly .",
    "in addition to the standard parameters ( physical density of baryons @xmath215 , cold dark matter @xmath216 , hubble constant @xmath217 , power index for primodrial density perturbation @xmath218 , neutrino density @xmath219 , thomson optical depth @xmath10 ) , we have added the extra ionization input energy @xmath220 in the long - lived decaying - particle case .",
    "we will not consider the short - live case since it is much more model dependent .",
    "as expected , @xmath131 correlates strongly with the thomson optical depth due to low - redshift stellar light ; it will thus be difficult to distinguish them from cmb observations alone .",
    "both @xmath10 and @xmath131 correlates strongly with baryon density @xmath215 and the primordial spectral index @xmath218 .",
    "if a decaying particle exists but is neglected in the fit , then results for the values of other cosmological parameters may be biased , and the error bars may be underestimated . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellip ] we plot error ellipses for @xmath221 and @xmath222 after marginalizing over the other parameters .",
    "there are other ways that particle decays during the cosmic dark ages could play a role in cosmology .",
    "decays might affect the recombination process @xcite .",
    "particle decays could produce a surfeit of free electrons after recombination ; these extra electrons could then facilitate the formation of @xmath223 molecules and thus potentially enhance the star - formation rate . on the other hand , particle decay may also heat up the gas , thus increase the jeans mass of the primordial gas and suppress early star formation .",
    "the final outcome requires detailed investigation which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "finally , if the contribution of the particle to reionization is significant , it may not require formation of structure at high redshift , thus eliminating one objection to warm dark - matter models .    with future experiments",
    ", we expect to obtain more precise information on the ionization history than we have now , and should a decaying particle with @xmath224 sec exist , we may discover it through indirect observations such as those discussed here .",
