    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) are driven purely by the quantum fluctuations when a parameter of the hamiltonian describing the system varies @xcite .",
    "traditionally , qpts can be well understood in the framework of the landau - ginzburg - wilson paradigm by resorting to the notions of local order parameter , long range correlations and symmetry breaking . in the past few years , a lot of efforts have been devoted into understanding the qpts from the information - geometry perspectives @xcite , such as quantum entanglement ent1,ent2,ent3,ent4 , entanglement entropy @xcite , quantum discord @xcite , quantum fidelity and fidelity susceptibility zanardi , venuti , gu07,gu10,chen , yang , zhao , damski1,dutta , damski2,nishiyama , berry phase @xcite and the quantum geometric tensor @xcite .    generally , qpts can be witnessed by some qualitative changes of the ground - state properties when some parameters of the hamiltonian across the quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "the underlying physical mechanism lies in the fact that the different phases are unconnected by the adiabatic evolution of the ground state . in the vicinity of the qcp ,",
    "the ground state driven by the parameters of the hamiltonian will lead to an avoided energy - level crossing between the ground state and the first excited state , where the adiabatic evolution can be destroyed by a vanishing energy gap as the system size tends to infinity . from perspective of the differential geometry of the ground state ,",
    "a monopole as a gapless point in the hamiltonian parameters space will generate some interesting effect on the ground - state local or topological properties , and these properties can be captured by some local quantities , i.e. , the fidelity susceptibility and the berry curvature ; or by some topological quantum numbers , i.e. , the chern number @xcite , @xmath1 number @xcite , and recently , the euler number of the bloch states manifold has been proposed @xcite .    recently , the concept of ground - state quantum geometric tensor has been introduced to analyze the qpts .",
    "what is surprising is that the two approaches of the ground - state berry curvature and the fidelity susceptibility as a witness to qpts are unified .",
    "specifically , the real part of the qgt is a riemannian metric defined over the parameter manifold , while the imaginary part is the berry curvature which flux give rise to the berry phase .",
    "the riemannian metric is recognized as the essential part of the fidelity susceptibility .",
    "generally , the riemannian metric and the berry curvature will exhibit some singularity or scaling behavior in the quantum critical region under the thermodynamic limit .",
    "particularly , a scaling analysis of the ground - state quantum geometric tensor in the vicinity of the critical points has been performed .",
    "so far , these approaches have been applied to detect the phases boundaries in various systems .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a cyclic quantum distance of the ground state to detect the qpts in a transverse field inhomogeneous ising spin-@xmath2 chain , in which the nearest - neighbor exchange interactions will take alternating parameters between the neighbor sites .",
    "this model can be solved exactly by introducing a general canonical transformation to diagonalize the fermionic hamiltonian mapped from the spin hamiltonian by the jordan - wigner transformation . in our scheme",
    ", an extra local gauge transformation is performed to the spin system by a twist operator , which endows the hamiltonian of the system with a topology of a ring @xmath0 without changing its energy spectrum .",
    "we obtain the exact expression of the ground - state riemannian metric and study the cyclic quantum distance of the ground state on the parameter manifold .",
    "we study extensively the ground - state riemannian metric in different parameter region of the inhomogeneous ising chain .",
    "particularly , we show that the quantum ferromagnetic phase in the uniform ising chain can be marked by an invariant cyclic quantum distance of the ground state , and the distance decay to zero rapidly in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "let us consider an inhomogeneous ising spin-@xmath3 chain , which consists of @xmath4 cells with two sites in each cell , and in an external magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath5\\]]where @xmath6 are the local pauli operators , @xmath7 is the exchange coupling , @xmath8 is the external field and the periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) has been assumed .",
    "a similar inhomogeneous @xmath9 spin model has been investigated in ref.@xcite , and here we give a brief discussion for the completeness of this work .",
    "first , we subject the system to a local gauge transformation @xmath10 by a twist operator @xmath11 $ ] , which in fact makes the system rotate on the spin along the @xmath12-direction .",
    "it can be verified that @xmath13 is @xmath14 periodic in the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "considering the unitarity of the twist operator @xmath16 , the energy spectrum and critical behavior of the system are obviously independent with the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the spin hamiltonian can be mapped exactly on a spinless fermion model through the jordan - wigner transformation @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are the spin ladder operators , and @xmath20 are the fermion operators .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath21 is transformed into @xmath22note that the pbc on the spin degrees of freedom @xmath23,@xmath24 imply that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the total fermion number .",
    "thus the boundary conditions on the fermionic system will obey pbc or anti - pbc depending on whether @xmath27 is even or odd .",
    "the differences between the two boundary conditions are negligible in the thermodynamic limit . without loss of generality",
    ", we take the pbc on the fermionic system , which means @xmath28 .",
    "second , applying the following fourier transformation @xmath29 and @xmath30 to the hamiltonian @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , ( @xmath33and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the coordinate of site @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) on the @xmath38-th cell in the lattice with the lattice parameter @xmath39 .",
    "now , the hamiltonian @xmath40 in the momentum space reads@xmath41   \\notag \\\\ & & -[(j_{a}e^{i2\\varphi + ika}-j_{b}e^{i2\\varphi -ika})a_{-k}b_{k}+h.c.]\\ .\\end{aligned}\\]]this hamiltonian @xmath31 can be exactly diagonalized as@xmath42by using the following canonical transformation , i.e. , @xmath43where @xmath44and the quasiparticle energy spectrums are @xmath45",
    "now , we focus on the geometric properties of the ground state . the hamiltonian @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ diagham ] ) has been diagonalized in the set of quasiparticle number operators , which allows us to determine all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "we note that the energy spectrums @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the ground state , denoted as @xmath50 , corresponds to the state with the lowest energy , which consists of state with no @xmath51 and @xmath52 fermions occupied but with @xmath53 and @xmath54 fermions occupied .",
    "explicitly , the ground state can be constructed as follows @xmath55where @xmath56 is the normalized factor , and @xmath57 are the vacuum states of fermionic operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 for all @xmath64 .",

    "it can be verified that the quantum geometric tensor can be derived from a gauge invariant distance between two ground states on the @xmath74 line bundle induced by the quantum adiabatic evolution of ground states @xmath75 in parameter @xmath15 space .",
    "the quantum distance @xmath76 between two ground states @xmath50 and @xmath77 .",
    "note that the term @xmath78 can be decomposed as @xmath79 \\left\\vert { { { { \\partial _ { \\varphi } gs(\\varphi ) } } } } \\right\\rangle $ ] , where @xmath80 is the projection operator and @xmath81 is the covariant derivative of @xmath82 on the @xmath74 line bundle . under the condition of the quantum adiabatic evolution",
    ", the evolution from @xmath82 to @xmath83 will undergo a parallel transport in the sense of levi - civit from @xmath84 to @xmath85 on the parameter manifold , and hence we have @xmath86 .",

    "( [ qgt ] ) , we can derive the concrete expression of @xmath89 . obviously , the straightforward calculation is tedious .",
