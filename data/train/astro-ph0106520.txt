    "dust grains exist everywhere  from circumstellar environment to interstellar space . hence , radiation from celestial objects is always absorbed and scattered by dust grains . without correction for the dust extinction , we inevitably underestimate the intrinsic intensity of the radiation , and our understanding of physics of these objects may be misled .",
    "thus , dust extinction for nonionizing photons ( @xmath1  ) in the interstellar medium ( ism ) has been well studied to date ( e.g. , interstellar extinction curve : @xcite ) .    in h ii regions , lyman continuum ( lc )",
    "photons also suffer extinction by dust grains ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to this another type of extinction as the lyman continuum extinction ( lce ) .",
    "indeed , the fraction of lc photons absorbed by dust in h ii regions can be large ( e.g. , petrosian , silk , & field 1972 ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , for example , have estimated the fraction of lc photons contributing to hydrogen ionization to be 0.26 in the orion nebula .",
    "if a large amount of lc photons is absorbed by dust in h ii regions , the effect of the lce on estimating the star formation rate ( sfr ) will be very large .",
    "this is because we can only estimate the number of ionizing photons , lc photons used for hydrogen ionization , from the observation of hydrogen recombination lines or thermal radio continuum .",
    "when we define the fraction of ionizing photons estimated from observations as @xmath2 , we obtain @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the intrinsic and apparent production rates of lc photons , respectively .",
    "unless we correct the observed data for the lce , we can not obtain the actual lc photon production rate , and then , the true sfr .",
    "therefore , we should estimate the fraction , @xmath2 , in h ii regions .",
    "however , the lce has not been discussed in the context of estimating the sfr of galaxies before inoue , hirashita , & kamaya ( 2001a , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "paper i has proposed two independent methods for estimating @xmath2 , and applied the methods to the galactic h ii regions .",
    "then , they have shown that there are a number of h ii regions with @xmath6 in the galaxy . moreover , they have found that @xmath2 can be approximated to be only a function of dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "if the approximation can be applied to the nearby spiral galaxies and their observed dust - to - gas ratios are adopted , @xmath2 averaged over galactic scale is about 0.3 .",
    "therefore , the sfr corrected by the lce effect is 3 times larger than the uncorrected sfr .",
    "the aim of this paper is that we confirm these results of paper i not only for h ii regions in our galaxy but for extragalactic h ii regions .",
    "we also discuss if the effect of the lce on estimating the sfr of galaxies is really important .",
    "we describe the method for estimating @xmath2 in section 2 .",
    "then , @xmath2 is determined for the h ii regions in the local group galaxies in section 3 .",
    "we discuss the dependence of @xmath2 on the dust - to - gas ratio in section 4 , and our conclusions are summarized in the final section .",
    "to estimate @xmath2 in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) for each h ii region , the apparent production rate of lc photons in each region , @xmath5 , is compared to its ir luminosity , @xmath7 . in this paper , we use a method for estimating @xmath2 presented in section 3 of paper i.    according to equation ( 12 ) in paper i , we obtain @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the average efficiency of dust absorption for nonionizing ( @xmath1  ) photons , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the ir luminosity and lc photon production rate normalized by @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 s@xmath15 , respectively . the equation is based on the theory of the ir emission from h ii regions by @xcite and the following discussion by @xcite .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that @xmath16 is proportional to the flux ratio of the ir emission to the thermal radio emission , h@xmath17 line , etc .",
    "if we express in the form of the flux ratio , the determination of @xmath2 is free from the uncertainty of the distance to the object .    here , we describe some assumptions adopted in the derivation of equation ( [ eq2 - 1 ] ) . since @xmath7 is the total energy emitted by dust , the wavelength range",
    "is set to 81000 , which covers almost all wavelength range of dust emission .",
    "also , it is supposed that the ir radiation from h ii regions is dominated by large ( @xmath18 ) grains in thermal equilibrium with ambient radiation field . in other words",
    ", we neglect the contribution to the total ir luminosity of very small grains ( @xmath19 ) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , which emit mainly in the mid - infrared ( mir , 840 ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in principle , the assumption would make us underestimate the total ir luminosity of dust in h ii regions because such mir emission is observed from these regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "fortunately , it seems that the contribution of the mir luminosity to that of the total ir is enough small to be neglected ( figure 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of h ii regions is assumed to be a modified black - body function with one temperature through the paper .",
    "moreover , we do not take account of the existence of helium .",
    "this is because almost all ( 96% according to @xcite ) photons produced by helium recombination can ionize neutral hydrogen .",
    "we do not consider the escape of lc photons from h ii regions , either . indeed",
    ", less than 3 % of lc photons can escape from the star - forming regions in nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "in short , we deal with an ideal h ii region that consists of only hydrogen and dust , and where no lc photons leak .",
    "let us determine @xmath9 , which denotes the average efficiency of dust absorption for nonionizing photons .",
    "the total ( absorption and scattering ) optical depth of dust , @xmath20 , is expressed by @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the absorption optical depth of dust , the dust albedo , and the amount of extinction at wavelength , @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "we can determine @xmath24 from an extinction curve , @xmath26 , and its normalization , @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28 . the efficiency of dust absorption at wavelength , @xmath25 , @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30 then , averaging @xmath29 over @xmath25 with weight of the intrinsic stellar flux density yields the average efficiency , @xmath9 .",
    "we show @xmath9 as a function of @xmath27 in figure [ f1 ] . in this calculation",
    ", we set the stellar spectrum to be simply the black - body of 30000 k. the change of the temperature dose not alter the result significantly .",
    "for example , if we choose 50000 k as the effective temperature of stars , the value of @xmath9 increases with a factor of about 1 % .",
    "the calculation of the average is performed from 1100 to 3500  .",
    "we adopt two types of the interstellar extinction curve , @xmath26 : one is that in our galaxy @xcite , the other is that in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite . each case is shown in figure [ f1 ] by the solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "moreover , we set the dust albedo to be a constant of 0.5 for simplicity , although it varies with wavelength @xcite .",
    "the results in this case are shown by the thick lines .",
    "also , the results without scattering ( i.e. @xmath31 ) are shown by the thin lines for comparison .",
    "once we determine @xmath9 for h ii regions from figure [ f1 ] , we can estimate @xmath2 from the ratio of the ir luminosity to the observed lc photon production rate via equation ( [ eq2 - 1 ] ) . in the next section",
    ", we will examine @xmath2 for h ii regions in some local group galaxies .",
    "in order to determine @xmath2 , the data of the ir luminosity and the production rate of lc photons for the individual h ii region are required .",
    "but , when we compare two photometric data , we must match their apertures and resolutions with each other , because , in general , different observations have different aperture and resolution .",
    "it prevents us from constructing uniform data of a large number of h ii regions .",
    "these effects produce one of the largest uncertainties in the current analysis .",
    "we have gathered the data that allow us to estimate @xmath2 with proper accuracy , though the sample size is rather small . in this section",
    ", we estimate @xmath2 of h ii regions in our galaxy , m31 , m33 , and lmc .",
    "suitable data for our analysis have been compiled by @xcite .",
    "the data are read out from their figure 9 directly , and are tabulated in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the column 1 is the name of h ii regions .",
    "since two separate components of w3 , w51 , and ngc 6537 are plotted in figure 9 of @xcite , we list both components of these regions in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the columns 2 and 3 are the logarithmic production rate of lc photons estimated from radio observations and fir ( 40350 ) luminosity , respectively . the fir ( 40350 )",
    "luminosity is almost equal to the total ir ( 81000 ) luminosity if the dust sed is assumed to be the modified black - body function with the temperature of 30 k and the emissivity index of 1 .    since @xmath32 for the galactic h ii regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , figure [ f1 ] tells us that @xmath33 , even in the case with the scattering for nonionizing photons",
    "thus , we can safely assume @xmath34 for the galactic h ii regions , so that we can determine @xmath2 of these regions via equation ( [ eq2 - 1 ] ) ( column 5 ) .",
    "the mean value of @xmath2 is 0.45 .",
    "thus , we find that about half of lc photons is absorbed by dust in h ii regions .",
    "this is one of the results in paper i.      @xcite have studied the properties of discrete fir sources in m31 by using the _ iras _ hires image ( @xcite ) .",
    "thirty nine sources are extracted from the 60  map .",
    "they have also examined the correlation between these fir sources and h@xmath17 sources presented by @xcite . since @xcite have surveyed only the northeast half of m31 , 12 out of 39 fir sources have h@xmath17 counterparts .",
    "these twelve fir sources make the sample for the current analysis . in table",
    "[ t2 ] , some properties of the sample h ii regions in m31 are listed .",
    "the column 2 of table [ t2 ] is the measured flux density at 60 .",
    "unfortunately , only the 60  flux densities of almost all sample regions are available .",
    "hence , we estimate total ir luminosity of dust emission in each region from the 60  flux density by the following way : assuming the ir sed of these fir sources to be the modified black - body function with temperature of 30 k and emissivity index of 1 , we obtain @xmath35 , where the wavelength range of the ir luminosity , @xmath7 , is 81000 , and @xmath36 kpc is the adopted distance to m31 . the derived ir luminosities are shown in the column 3 of table [ t2 ] . the adopted dust temperature of 30 k is reasonable because dust temperature of 10 isolated h ii regions whose flux densities at both 60 and 100  are listed in table 3 of @xcite is estimated to be 29 k on average .",
    "since the angular resolution of h@xmath17 image is much higher than that of 60  image , numerous h@xmath17 sources are included in the area over which the flux density of one fir source at 60  is integrated .",
    "the sum of the h@xmath17 fluxes in the area of each fir source is shown in the column 4 of table [ t2 ] .",
    "these values are corrected for the [ nii ] contamination by assuming a constant ratio of [ nii]/h@xmath17 = 0.3 @xcite .",
    "when we estimate the production rate of lc photons from h@xmath17 flux , we must correct it for the interstellar extinction .",
    "@xcite have commented that the mode of the interstellar extinction at h@xmath17 is 0.8 mag . since this value of extinction",
    "is estimated from the column density of hi gas , it is a typical extinction averaged over the ism of m31 .",
    "if we assume the case b and the gas temperature of 10000 k @xcite , we obtain @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is h@xmath17 flux ( column 4 ) and @xmath39 mag is the assumed amount of extinction at h@xmath17 line .",
    "the derived @xmath5 is in the column 5 .",
    "the ratio of the ir luminosity to the lc photon production rate is shown in the column 6 .",
    "now , we need to estimate @xmath9 . adopting @xmath40 and the galactic extinction curve ,",
    "@xmath27 is @xmath41 mag when @xmath42 mag .",
    "then , we can assume @xmath43 for the h ii regions in m31 from the line for the dust albedo of 0.5 in figure [ f1 ] . finally , we determine @xmath2 via equation ( [ eq2 - 1 ] ) ( column 7 ) .",
    "the mean @xmath2 is 0.38 , which is almost equal to that of the galactic h ii regions .",
    "also , @xcite have compared the h@xmath17 emission map of m31 with the ir emission map produced by the maximum correlation method ( iras hires image ) .",
    "they divided the h@xmath17 emission into three components ; the star - forming ring , the bright nucleus , and diffuse ( unidentified ) component .",
    "the star - forming ring , whose diameter is 165 , has the observed h@xmath17+[nii ] luminosity of @xmath44 .",
    "they estimated its ir ( 81000 ) luminosity to be @xmath45 by assuming the modified black - body function with 26 k and the index of 1 .",
    "if we regard the star - forming ring as an aggregation of a lot of h ii regions , and assume @xmath39 mag and [ nii]/h@xmath17 = 0.3 , we obtain @xmath46 for the ring .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath47 when @xmath48 .",
    "the value of @xmath2 shows a good agreement with the mean @xmath2 of the sample in table [ t2 ] .",
    "we find suitable data of h ii regions in m33 in devereux , duric , & scowen ( 1997 ) , who examine correlation between h@xmath17 , fir , and thermal radio emission of m33 .",
    "they have reported some properties of 8 isolated h ii regions .",
    "we determine @xmath2 of these regions .",
    "the sample properties are tabulated in table [ t3 ] .    in the column 2 ,",
    "fir ( 401000 ) luminosities of the h ii regions , which are determined from the flux densities at 60 and 100  measured from _",
    "iras _ hires images , are presented . in the column 3 ,",
    "the 5 ghz flux densities ( see also @xcite ) are shown , and the estimated lc photon production rates are in the column 4 via @xmath49 @xcite . for the distance to m33 ,",
    "840 kpc is adopted .",
    "if dust sed can be fitted by modified black - body function ( emissivity index of 1 , 30k ) , we have @xmath50 ( 401000 ) @xmath51 ( 81000 ) .",
    "we determine the ratio of the ir luminosity to the photon production rate under this assumption ( column 5 ) .",
    "@xcite have also commented on the properties of the interstellar extinction for the h ii regions in m33 .",
    "they have compared h@xmath17 emission with thermal radio emission , and argued in their figure 7 that the average extinction is @xmath52 mag ( i.e. @xmath42 mag ) , although there is a large dispersion corresponding to @xmath53 mag .",
    "thus , we can assume @xmath43 for all the sample regions in m33 as well as those in m31 .",
    "the determined values of @xmath2 are listed in the column 6 of table [ t3 ] .",
    "the mean is 0.41 , although the large dispersion of the interstellar extinction may cause a large dispersion of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we saw that @xmath54 or less for the h ii regions in m31 and m33 .",
    "hence , we conclude that the typical values of @xmath2 in these galaxies are nearly equal to that in our galaxy .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the fraction of lc photons consumed by dust in the h ii regions of other spiral galaxies may be a @xmath55 as well as that in the galaxy , m31 , and m33 .",
    "@xcite have provided the data of 6 h ii regions in the lmc .",

    ", we assume the dust sed to be modified black - body function with 30 k and index of 1 , that is , @xmath7 ( 81000 ) @xmath57 1.66 @xmath50 ( 40120 ) .",
    "then , the estimated total ir luminosities are shown in the column 4 .",
    "the adopted distance to the lmc is 51.8 kpc . from the flux densities at 5 ghz in the column 5 ,",
    "the production rates of lc photons are calculated via condon s formula in section 3.3 ( column 6 ) .",
    "the color excess of each region , @xmath27 , estimated from the observed balmer decrement and corrected for a foreground reddening is listed in the column 8 .",
    "using the line of the lmc extinction law and the dust albedo of 0.5 in figure [ f1 ] , we obtained the value of @xmath9 from each @xmath27 ( column 9 ) .",
    "finally , @xmath2 is determined for each sample region ( column 10 ) .",
    "the mean @xmath2 is 0.74 .",
    "this is obviously larger than those of the galaxy , m31 , and m33 .    @xcite",
    "have also determined @xmath2 for these regions .",
    "her mean @xmath2 is @xmath58 , which is consistent with that in the current paper . here",
    ", we should note that @xmath2 of @xcite is determined from the dust optical depth for uv ( 10003000  ) photons . by the definition of @xmath2 ,",
    "however , it should be determined from the dust optical depth for lc photons ( @xmath59  ) such as we stated in paper i or this paper .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite have compared the ir , h@xmath17 , and radio emission from the lmc , and have examined more global correlations among these emissions .",
    "they have displayed appealing contour maps of these wavelengths , which strongly make us believe that these three kinds of emission have the same origin , i.e. the star - forming regions .",
    "indeed , there are excellent coincidences among ir , thermal radio , and h@xmath17 sources ( see also @xcite for the galactic sources ) . according to @xcite , the fir ( 40120 ) flux associating with the star formation in the lmc is @xmath60 w m@xmath61 , and the thermal radio flux density at 6.3 cm in the same area is 131 jy .",
    "since the corresponding @xmath62 is 0.13 , @xmath63 when we assume @xmath64 ( the average value for the sample in table [ t4 ] ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with the mean @xmath2 of the sample in table [ t4 ] .",
    "therefore , we conclude that @xmath2 of the h ii regions in the lmc is about 0.7 and larger than those in the spiral galaxies like the galaxy , m31 , and m33",
    ". the larger @xmath2 may be caused by the lower metallicity of the lmc .",
    "a lower metallicity is likely to lead to a smaller dust - to - gas ratio , so that the fraction of ionizing photons , @xmath2 , increases .",
    "the issue will be discussed more closely in the next section .",
    "we have estimated @xmath2 for each h ii region in some local group galaxies by comparing its observed ir luminosity with production rate of lc photons . here , we discuss what the determined @xmath2 values suggest .",
    "first , we discuss the relationship between the mean @xmath2 of each galaxy and its metallicity ( or dust - to - gas ratio ) .",
    "we naturally expect that the effect of the lce becomes larger as the dust content increases .",
    "then , we also expect the mean @xmath2 of sample h ii regions to be a function of dust - to - gas ratio or metallicity of their host galaxy . in order to examine the issue , we summarize some parameters of each galaxy in table [ t5 ] .",
    "the mean @xmath2 with its sample standard deviation is shown in the column 2 of table [ t5 ] . also , we find metallicities and dust - to - gas mass ratios of sample galaxies in the columns 3 and 4 , respectively . here , the metallicities are taken from @xcite .",
    "the dust - to - gas mass ratios except for that of m31 are taken from @xcite , who have estimated the dust - to - gas ratio from the ratio of the amount of visual extinction to the surface density of h i gas .",
    "for m31 , we determined the dust - to - gas ratio from the observed dust mass and gas mass directly . according to the observation of @xcite by _ iso _ , m31 have @xmath65 as the dust mass .",
    "also , m31 contains h i gas of @xmath66 @xcite and h@xmath67 gas of @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "thus , the dust - to - gas mass ratio of m31 is @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , the dust - to - gas ratios of sample galaxies are normalized by a typical one of the ism in our galaxy , @xmath70 @xcite",
    ".    in figure [ f2 ] , mean @xmath2 values of h ii regions in each galaxy are plotted as a function of metallicity .",
    "we may find a trend that the mean @xmath2 decreases as the metallicity increases .",
    "we also show that mean @xmath2 as a function of dust - to - gas mass ratio in figure [ f3 ] . in this figure",
    ", the mean @xmath2 seems to become small as the dust - to - gas ratio becomes large .",
    "however , since the number of sample galaxies is still small , more investigation is needed . for example",
    ", the dependence of @xmath2 on metallicity will become clearer if we examine h ii regions in the small magellanic cloud or other metal poor galaxies , or examine the relation of this issue to the abundance gradient of galaxies .",
    "let us see how to produce two solid lines in figure [ f3 ] . in parer",
    "i , we have formulated the dust optical depth for lc photons , @xmath71 , as a function of its dust - to - gas ratio ( see also @xcite ) ; @xmath72 where @xmath71 is evaluated over the actual ionized radius of a spherical h ii region containing dust grains uniformly . here , we estimate @xmath71 at the lyman limit approximately . in the right hand side , @xmath73 is the dust - to - gas mass ratio which is normalized by a typical galactic ism value , @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the coefficient , @xmath75 , is a factor depending on the production rate of lc photons and the gas density of the h ii region . for a galaxy having the galactic dust - to - gas ratio ,",
    "the coefficient , @xmath75 , means the dust optical depth for lc photons itself .",
    "we find , in paper i , @xmath76 for the observed lc photon production rates and electron number densities in the sample of galactic h ii regions . of this paper , and the method estimating @xmath2 is also different from that in the paper . see paper i for detail . ] @xcite have derived the relation between the monochromatic dust optical depth , @xmath71 , and @xmath2 as the following ; @xmath77 the relation is shown in figure 1 of paper i. when @xmath73 is given , therefore , we determine @xmath2 via equations ( [ eq4 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq4 - 2 ] ) .",
    "the data points in figure [ f3 ] are well reproduced by setting @xmath782 in equation ( [ eq4 - 1 ] ) .    here",
    ", we assume that the dust - to - gas ratio in h ii regions to be almost equal to a typical value of that in the ism of the host galaxy , although the ratio in local may vary significantly across the galaxy @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the mean value of the dust - to - gas ratio of the h ii gas in our galaxy is almost equal to those of the h i and h@xmath67 gas @xcite .",
    "thus , the assumption may be valid globally .    in this paper ,",
    "the determined @xmath2 values are somewhat larger than those in paper i systematically .",
    "that is , the suitable @xmath75 parameter in equation ( [ eq4 - 1 ] ) for the data points is 1 rather than 2 which is the best fit value in paper i. this may be because we neglect the mir component emitted by very small grains and pahs in the dust ir luminosity ( see section 2 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath2 determined here may be an upper limit .",
    "also , @xmath2 in paper i is considered to be a lower limit because the scattering of lc photons by dust is not taken into account in paper i.    anyway , the model presented by equations ( [ eq4 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq4 - 2 ] ) can reproduce the trend of the observational data , when the coefficient , @xmath75 , is set to between 1 and 2 . in short",
    ", the @xmath73@xmath2 relation falls in the area between two curves in figure [ f3 ] . therefore , we conclude that @xmath2 is expected a function of dust - to - gas ratio ( or metallicity ) : as the dust content increases , @xmath2 becomes smaller .",
    "finally , we discuss the effect of the lce on estimating the sfr . by the definition of @xmath2 in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , we obtain the correction factor for the sfr by the lce as @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath2 is a function of dust - to - gas ratio , the correction factor is also a function of dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "this is shown in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "clearly , we find that the correction factor increases as dust - to - gas ratio increases . for nearby spiral galaxies , their dust - to - gas ratios distribute around the galactic value ( @xcite , see also paper i ) . indeed , even the starburst galaxies ( e.g. , m82 ) and the ultra - luminous ir ( ulir ) galaxies ( e.g. , arp 220 ) are likely to have about the galactic dust - to - gas ratio @xcite . for such dust - to - gas ratio",
    ", we expect that the correction factor is 25 .",
    "thus , the effect of the lce is more important than the uncertainty of the imf , which is about a factor of 2 ( e.g. , inoue et al .",
    "therefore , we should take account of the lce effect when we estimate the sfr of nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "to examine the lyman continuum extinction ( lce ) in h ii regions , we compared the observed infrared emission with production rate of lyman continuum photons for 49 h ii regions in our galaxy , m31 , m33 , and lmc .",
    "then , we estimate the fraction of lyman continuum photons contributing to hydrogen ionization , @xmath2 , in these regions .",
    "we reached the following conclusions :    [ 1 ] in many h ii regions , @xmath2 is smaller than 0.5 . the mean @xmath2 of the sample regions in spiral galaxies ( our galaxy , m31 , and m33 ) is about 0.4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean @xmath2 in the h ii regions in the lmc is about 0.7 .    [",
    "2 ] the mean @xmath2 of sample h ii regions in each galaxy may be a function of metallicity or dust - to - gas ratio of their host galaxy .",
    "namely , @xmath2 decreases as the metallicity or dust - to - gas ratio increases .",
    "[ 3 ] the observational trend is reproduced very well by the model that the dust optical depth for lyman continuum photons over the ionized region is proportional to the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the dust optical depth is in between 1 and 2 for the galactic dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "[ 4 ] it is expected that the correction factor for the star formation rate by the lce increases as dust - to - gas ratio ( metallicity ) increases . the expected correction factor for the galaxies with",
    "the galactic dust - to - gas ratio is 25 .",
    "therefore , the lce effect should be taken into account when we estimate the sfr of the nearby spiral galaxies , since the dust - to - gas ratios of these galaxies are almost same as that in the galaxy .",

    ". therefore , equation ( [ eq2 - 1 ] ) is reduced to @xmath88 in figure [ fa ] , we show the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath89 derived from equation ( [ eqa-2 ] ) for various @xmath9 .",
