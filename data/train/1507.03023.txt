    "phase locking or synchronization effects can arise in coupled oscillators when the different frequencies lock together over a certain range of parameter space , an effect that was first reported by huygens for the synchronization of pendulum clocks @xcite .",
    "phase locking has been extensively studied for numerous dynamical systems ranging from a pair of coupled oscillators to an entire coupled oscillator array @xcite .",
    "a single particle moving over a tilted one - dimensional washboard potential can also experience phase locking when an additional ac driving force is applied .",
    "the substrate periodicity produces intrinsic periodic modulations of the particle velocity in the absence of an ac drive which increase in frequency as the magnitude of the tilt or dc drive increases .",
    "addition of an external fixed - frequency ac drive produces locking regimes in which the average dc velocity remains constant even as the magnitude of the dc drive is increased .",
    "the same picture can be applied to josephson junctions , where the analog of a velocity - force curve is the voltage - current curve , which exhibits a series of phase locking regions called shapiro steps under an applied ac drive for single junctions @xcite and coupled arrays of junctions @xcite .",
    "one of the hallmarks of shapiro steps is that the step width oscillates as a function of the ac drive amplitude @xcite .",
    "shapiro step phenomena also arise in dc and ac driven charge density waves @xcite , spin density waves @xcite , and frenkel - kontorova models consisting of commensurate or incommensurate arrangements of particles moving over ordered or disordered substrates @xcite . in the case of vortex motion in type - ii superconductors , martinoli",
    "_ et al . _ reported the first observation of shapiro steps for dc and ac driven vortices interacting with a periodic one - dimensional ( 1d ) substrate created by periodic thickness modulations of the sample @xcite , while similar effects were observed for vortices driven over 1d @xcite or two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xcite periodic substrates .",
    "more recently , shapiro steps have been found for ac and dc driven colloidal particles moving over a quasi-1d periodic substrate @xcite .",
    "shapiro steps can also occur when a lattice of collectively interacting particles moves over a _",
    "substrate under combined dc and ac drives . here , the effective elastic coupling between the particles comprising the lattice generates an intrinsic washboard frequency that can lock to the applied ac driving frequency .",
    "such steps have been studied for vortices moving over random disorder @xcite or through confined channel geometries @xcite . for particles confined to 2d and moving over a quasi-1d substrate , both",
    "the ac and dc drives must be applied in the same direction to produce shapiro steps ; however , for vortices moving over 2d periodic or egg - carton substrates , it is possible to obtain what are called transverse phase locking steps when the ac drive is perpendicular to the direction of the dc drive @xcite .",
    "these phase locking steps are distinct from shapiro steps , and their widths grow quadratically with increasing ac amplitude rather than showing the oscillatory behavior associated with shapiro steps .",
    "phase locking effects can also occur for overdamped particle motion in 2d periodic systems under combinations of two perpendicular ac drives , producing localized and delocalized motion as well as rectification effects @xcite .    in systems such as vortices and colloidal particles ,",
    "an overdamped description of the equations of motion is appropriate .",
    "in contrast , the skyrmions that were recently discovered in chiral magnets have particle - like properties and many similarities to superconducting vortices , but have the important distinction that there is a strong non - dissipative magnus force in their motion @xcite .",
    "the skyrmions can be set into motion by an applied current and are observed to have a very small depinning threshold @xcite , in part because the effectiveness of the magnus force can be up to ten times stronger than the dissipative force component .",
    "the magnus force introduces a velocity component of the skyrmion that is perpendicular to the direction of an imposed external force , so a skyrmion deflects from or spirals around an attractive pinning site rather than moving directly toward the potential minimum as would occur for systems governed by overdamped dynamics @xcite . since skyrmions are particle - like objects , many of their dynamical properties can be captured using a point particle model based on a modified theile s equation that takes into account repulsive skyrmion - skyrmion interactions , the magnus force , damping , and substrate interactions @xcite . such as approach",
    "has been shown to match well with micromagnetic modeling @xcite of the depinning of skyrmions in periodic @xcite and random pinning arrays @xcite .",
    "particle - based skyrmion models were used to describe the motion of skyrmions interacting with single pinning sites @xcite as well as skyrmion motion in confined regions @xcite . since",
    "skyrmions can easily be driven with an applied external drive they potentially open a new class of experimentally accessible dynamical systems where the magnus force has a dominant effect .",
    "it should be possible to create various types of potential energy landscapes for skyrmions through techniques such as thickness modulations , periodic applied stain , controlled irradiation , or spatially periodic doping .",
    "an open question is how known phase locking phenomena would be affected by the inclusion of a magnus force , and whether new types of phase locking effects might appear that are absent in overdamped systems .",
    "skyrmions also have potential for various spintronic applications @xcite which would require the skyrmions to move in a controlled manner , so an understanding of skyrmion phase locking dynamics could be useful for producing new methods for precision control of skyrmion motion .     on a periodic quasi-1d substrate with @xmath0 .",

    "the skyrmion motion takes the form of intricate periodic 2d orbits .",
