    "while the constituent valence quark model provides a simple and almost quantitative phenomenological description of the magnetic moments of the octet baryons , it does in its simplest versions , where the pions couple directly to the quarks , lead to values for the decay width of the @xmath1 , which are only about one half of the empirical value .",
