    "since the advent of maxwell demon 150 years ago , the study of relationship between thermodynamics and information has attracted much attention because it concerns the foundation of second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "maxwell demon is formulated as an information processing device that performs measurement including memory register and feedback at the level of thermal fluctuations .",
    "this demon refers to any general situation in which rectification of microscopic fluctuations decrease thermodynamic entropy . to preserve the second law from violating , information to memory register plays an essential role .",
    "information entropy of the memory register compensates the decrease of the thermodynamic entropy of the device@xcite .",
    "recent studies have revealed that information content and thermodynamic variables to be treated on equal footings ( information thermodynamics)@xcite .",
    "this relationship has attracted much interest recently due to advances of nano - technology which have enabled to access atomic - scale objects in a controllable manner .",
    "experimentally maxwell demon and szilard engine have been realized in laboratory@xcite .",
    "this has allowed verification of several fundamental issues regarding thermodynamics of information and physical nature of information .",
    "recently mandal and jarzynski ( mj ) have introduced an autonomous maxwell demon model @xcite for heat engine .",
    "apart from heat reservoir the model consists of three parts such as work source , the device and information reservoir .",
    "a mass that can be raised or lowered against gravity is used as a work source while the device operates in cycle and affects the transfer of energy among other subsystems .",
    "an information reservoir is a system that exchanges information but not energy with the device .",
    "a frictionless tape acts as an information reservoir that preserves the information .",
    "the reading and writing of information does not require any energy while passing through the demon .",
    "depending upon the parameter , they have showed that the system sometime functions as an engine or erasure or none of them(called dud state ( mj ) ) .    in this paper",
    ", we have extended their model by introducing two reservoirs coupled to the system .",
    "the main motivation of our study is to find the effect of thermal bias along with information reservoir and the work reservoir in the performance of the demon .",
    "the system reaches an unique steady state for any given set of parameters ( which will be described in detail below ) .",
    "the dynamics are autonomous .",
    "the performance of our model basically depends on the interplay between different forces : the gravitational pull on the mass and the changing the information content on the stream of bits written on the tape .",
    "the system can act as an engine by extracting work on an average ; an erasure by removing the information from the memory register ( tape ) , a refrigerator by absorbing heat from cold bath .",
    "our system also exhibits combination of any of the two in its modes of operation .",
    "for example it simultaneously acts as i ) an engine and a refrigerator , ii ) an engine and an eraser , iii ) a refrigerator and an eraser .",
    "our results are consistent with generalized second law of thermodynamics .",
    "we will discuss model and findings in detail below .",
    "we have extended the autonomous maxwell demon model by mj . to this end",
    "we have considered similar three state system ( a , b , c ) but these states have different energy levels ( unlike mj ) , i.e. , they are not degenerate ( see fig.[model1 ] and fig.[model2 ] ) . for simplicity we have considered difference between the two successive energy levels to be same ( @xmath0 ) . note that minimum three states are needed to observe any directed rotation .",
    "the transition can occur between a to b , b to c and vise versa spontaneously by exchanging heat from the cold bath with temperature @xmath1 and internal energy of the system gets changed . however , the transition between a to c and vice versa is restricted and depends on the value of the interacting bit written on the tape .",
    "the bit has two states 0 and 1 .",
    "hence the combined system has 6 states . when the transition occur from c0 to a1 , the bit state",
    "is changed from 0 to 1 and vise versa .",
    "however , transition between c1 and a0 is not allowed .",
    "note that , during the transition between a and b , b and c the bit state is not changed . on the other hand , during the transition from c0 to a1 , energy is absorbed from the hot bath at temperature @xmath2 by an amount @xmath3 while the system perform @xmath4 amount of work by pulling a mass m to a height @xmath5 by a frictionless pulley in a gravitational force field @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) . during this transition",
    ", the internal energy of the demon is increased by @xmath8 . using energy balance one can get    @xmath9     0 , the mass is lifted at an amount @xmath5 for every transition c @xmath10 a while for every transition a @xmath10 c the mass is lowered by same amount .",
    "however @xmath11 0 the mass is connected to right side of the small circle , so the transition c @xmath10 a lowers the mass and the transition a @xmath10 c lift it up.,width=453 ]     similarly the difference between b and c is also @xmath0 .",
    "the energy absorbed / released during any transition between c0 and a1 is denoted as e such that @xmath12 .",
    "( b ) all the allowed transitions and corresponding bath where energy is exchanged.,width=453 ]        the rate of transition between c0 and a1 is related by @xmath13 we set boltzmann constant @xmath14 .",
    "if we take @xmath15 and @xmath16 , we get @xmath17 this weight parameter @xmath18 is bounded by @xmath19 .",
    "the other transitions occur due to connection to the cold bath @xmath1 and the rates are related by @xmath20 all the allowed transitions are shown in fig.[model2]b and they form a linear chain ( fig.[liner ] ) .",
    "the model can not exhibit a directed rotation , only back and forth transitions are possible . to get any possible rotation we need to introduce the change of bit externally .",
    "we consider the tape is moving with a rate @xmath21 from left to right .",
    "the system interacts only with the nearest bit ( one bit at a time ) .",
    "each bit is allowed to interact the system with time @xmath22 before the next bit takes its place . the earlier bit with new information content move forward along with the tape .",
    "if @xmath22 is very small the system hardly evolves during this time .",
    "if @xmath22 is large , the system gets enough opportunity to evolve along with the bit . after time @xmath22 ,",
    "the joint state may change and depends on the incoming bit . during this transition , actual state of the system ( a , b or c ) is not changed and hence it does not involve any energy cost .",
    "take an example : if the demon state is b and the outgoing bit in state 1 then the joint state will be b1 .",
    "now if the incoming bit is 0 , then the joint state at the beginning of the new cycle , will change to simply b0 .",
    "note that during this transition from b1 to b0 the internal energy of the demon is not changed since demons actual state is fixed at b.    in our present study we simulate this problem and analyze our findings .",
    "first we set @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 .",
    "this case correspond to the original problem of mj .",
    "now all the levels are degenerate .",
    "heat is exchanged only during the transition between a1 and c0 from a single bath with temperature t. let @xmath26 denotes excess number of 0 in the incoming bit stream ,    @xmath27    here @xmath28 and @xmath29 represents probability of 0 and 1 respectively in the incoming bit stream and they are normalized i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "the shannon entropy of the incoming bit stream ( written on the memory register or tape ) is given by @xmath31 it represents the amount of disorder present per bit .",
    "we have ignored the correlations between the successive bits .",
    "@xmath32 quantifies the information content in the incoming bit stream .",
    "consider the case when all incoming bits are 0 ; which implies @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "after the interaction time @xmath22 , if the joint state ends up at any of the following states a1 , b1 or c1 , the outgoing bit is changed to 1 .",
    "this implies during this time @xmath22 , there is one excess number of upward transitions compared to the downward transitions .",
    "if the final state is in a0 , b0 or c0 the outgoing bit will be in 0 state .",
    "for this situation , the number of upward transitions is balanced by the downward transitions . in long time limit @xmath35",
    ", the system will attain the steady state along with the tape .",
    "the outgoing bit stream will be mixture of 0 and 1 with probability @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "then the shannon entropy of the outgoing bit stream @xmath38 will be always positive .",
    "this means some information has been written on the tape ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "every 1 in the outgoing bit stream represents @xmath4 work is extracted by pulling the mass at an amount @xmath5 , taking the heat from the bath . hence for @xmath40 , on an average we have extracted work by rectifying the noise from the single heat bath .",
    "this is possible because the entropy of the memory register ( tape ) increases . now",
    "if we consider entropy of the memory register and bath , it together follows the second law @xmath41 @xmath42 represents entropy change of the bath .",
    "it may be noted that in steady state , the entropy change of the demon is zero on average .",
    "for @xmath43 the evolution of the combined system will depend on two forces : gravitational pull on the mass ( depends on weight parameter @xmath18 ) and the randomizations of bits ( @xmath44 ) along with the duration of the contact time of each bit @xmath22 . the average number of clockwise ( cw ) rotation is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46",
    ". note that during each upward transition ( cw rotation ) e energy is absorbed from the heat bath and same amount of work extracted ( @xmath47 ) . then on average @xmath48 heat will dissipated into the bath .",
    "as all the states of the demon is degenerate , one can easily find @xmath49 work will be done on the system on average . for @xmath50 ,",
    "work is extracted on average ( @xmath51 ) and system acts as an engine .",
    "for @xmath40 the incoming bit stream contains maximum information and @xmath52 . before the beginning of each interval , the probability of finding the demon in upper state or lower state is equal ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "however after the interaction , the system will relax and lower state will have larger probability ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "this leads to the information content in the outgoing bits to be less than that of the incoming bits ( @xmath55 ) . since @xmath56",
    ", we have @xmath57 ( eq.([def - q ] ) ) .",
    "this means work is done on the system to erase the information contained in the tape and the system acts as an erasure .    if all the incoming bits are 1 ( @xmath58 ) , after the interaction we obtain mixture of 0 and 1 in the outgoing bits .",
    "every 0 in the outgoing bit stream represents a counter clockwise ( ccw ) rotation . hence on average @xmath57 and @xmath59 . here",
    "the system neither behaves as an engine nor an erasure and we call it dud .",
    "till now we have considered @xmath60 .",
    "the negative @xmath4 represents the load is connected to the right side of the pulley .",
    "it makes for every transition c @xmath10 a the mass is lowered while for every transition from a @xmath10 c the mass is lifted up . as a result for @xmath61 the system acts as a dud while for @xmath58 the system performs as an engine .    in fig.[mandal1]a",
    "we have plotted our numerically obtained phase diagram for @xmath62 .",

    "that means during the cw or ccw rotation no work is done on the system and heat absorption is zero and thus @xmath68 and @xmath69 . the second law becomes @xmath59 since @xmath70 .",
    "we define this phase boundary where @xmath68 as * line 1 * ( shown as * black line * in fig.[mandal1 ] ) and it separates the engine and the dud regions .    at the phase boundary between engine and the erasure region",

    "we denote this boundary line as * line 2 * ( as denoted by * blue line * in fig.[mandal1 ] ) .",
    "it implies @xmath72 and total entropy production is also zero .",

    "note that here the demon operates reversibly and total entropy production is zero .    the third boundary line which separates the erasure and the dud region",
    "is called as * line 3 * ( as shown by * brown line * in fig.[mandal1 ] ) . here , @xmath71 but we have observed from phase diagram @xmath57 .",
