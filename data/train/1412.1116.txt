    "stable and spectrally pure lasers have widespread applications in optical frequency standards @xcite , measurement of fundamental constants @xcite , gravitational - wave detection @xcite , quantum information @xcite , high - resolution spectroscopy @xcite as well as stimulated adiabatic transfer of population between atomic / molecular levels @xcite .",
    "it has already been demonstrated that the laser frequency can be locked to better than @xmath5hz precision relative to a reference fabri - perot ( fp ) cavity .",
    "the ultimate linewidth achieved is then limited by the cavity",
    "s mechanical vibrational and thermal noise .",
    "recently a linewidth of @xmath6mhz was demonstrated by stabilizing a erbium - doped fiber laser to a silicon single - crystal fabri - perot cavity held at cryogenic temperatures @xcite .",
    "diode lasers are generally compact and cost effective , cover wide spectral ranges , can be tuned to the desired wavelength , and can be optically narrowed . for an extended cavity diode laser ( ecdl ) with the usual grating feedback the linewidth easily narrows to the @xmath7khz range @xcite . to further reduce",
    "the linewidth additional optical feedback from an external cavity @xcite can be employed , combined with a low frequency electronic lock to a reference cavity ( rc ) @xcite .",
    "the optical lock is difficult to maintain since one has to stabilize the  half - cavity \" between the ecdl and the optical feedback fp .",
    "different variations to stabilize and increase the dynamic range of the optical lock include balanced polarization - sensitive methods or dithering of the half - cavity path @xcite . for absolute frequency reference and additional noise reduction",
    "the rc spacer is fabricated out of ule ( corning ) , zerodur , or single - crystal silicon substrates , and the laser is stabilized at the zero crossing of the spacer s thermal expansion coefficient . the error signal from referencing the laser to the rc",
    "is generated using the pound - drever - hall ( pdh ) technique @xcite . in almost all scenarios for tuning the laser frequency in the range of the free spectral range ( fsr ) of the rc a configurations of at least 2 double - pass aoms",
    "has to be employed .    as an alternative to external cavity optical feedback",
    "one can lengthen the cavity length @xmath8 of the ecdl @xcite , since the linewidth @xmath9 depends inversely quadratically on the length as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the optical length of the laser diode ( ld ) .",
    "in addition , the laser is typically locked to a rc with a high bandwidth ( bw ) electronic lock . the mode - hop",
    "free tunability is then compromised relative to a short cavity setup . typically in most designs",
    "the slow integrated correction signal is applied to the piezo element ( pzt ) regulating the ecdl cavity length and the fast signal is applied to the injection current of the laser diode .",
    "the fast channel bw is typically limited to @xmath12mhz due to competing thermal and electronic charge carrier effects with opposite signs of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the laser wavelength and @xmath15 is the diode injection current .",
    "this is specific to the respective laser diode and requires that one individually adapts the design of the proportional - integral - derivative ( pid ) servo . in some of the above",
    "designs the useful output sent to the experiment is taken in transmission through a pre - stabilizing filter cavity ( fc ) ( which could be the same one providing the optical feedback @xcite ) to erase the remaining noise pedestal due to stochastic laser phase modulation , which typically caries about @xmath16 of the laser power and whose width @xmath17mhz and shape depend crucially on the pid parameters @xcite .    here",
    "we present a diode - laser system that is extremely robust to acoustic perturbations and that has superior long - term stability with high modularity suitable for various demanding applications .",
    "the linewidth narrowing is accomplished by a method independent of the specific laser diode .",
    "the continuous tunability of the laser without feed - forward @xcite is @xmath18ghz .",
    "we employ a low - acoustically susceptible mechanical design of an ecdl in littrow configuration in combination with a high bw and dynamic range fibered eom - nltl @xcite , a single doubly - diffracting aom , and a fc , each contributing both to the tuning and stabilization of the laser .",
    "the setup can be used in many different , more familiar configurations that are easily interchangeable from the one described in this work , where the roles of the components are disentangled , similar but still superior to standard laser systems , with the cost of adding additional infrastructure .",
    "the passive stability of the ecdl combined with the features of the above elements provides an economic and elegant solution to a high performance laser system and a good alternative to existing designs .",
    "the rough scheme is presented on fig.[full_diagram_0 ] .",
    "the output of the ecdl is passed through a fibered eom driven by the superposition of a direct digital synthesizer s ( dds ) sinusoidal output at fixed frequency @xmath19 and a sawtooth signal generated by a nltl powered by a frequency - doubled broadband high - bandwidth voltage - controlled oscillator ( vco ) at @xmath20 ( the factor of 2 results from a doubling stage after the vco ; see below ) .",
    "most of the light entering the eom at frequency @xmath21 is diffracted into the upper ( or lower , but not both ; a property of the serrodyne modulation technique @xcite , details in sec.[sec:2 ] ) sideband at @xmath22 .",
    "the spectral distribution after the eom is composed of mostly @xmath23 and a small leftover at @xmath21 with both frequencies accompanied by their small sidebands at @xmath24 ( panel 1 of fig.[full_diagram_0 ] ) . further the light is directed towards a 2-port tunable fc ( tuning is possible by a pzt ) that is resonant with @xmath23 .",
    "the laser is locked to the fc using a pdh lock at @xmath19 by slow / fast lock sent to the ecdl - pzt / eom - nltl respectively . in transmission",
    "the filtered light goes to the experiment with frequency @xmath25 ( panel 4 of fig.[full_diagram_0 ] ) . in reflection",
    "the light consists now of mostly @xmath21 and a leftover at @xmath23 ( the last portion results from the non - perfect mode matching and mirror losses ) .",
    "a small portion of it is necessary for the pdh lock ( using the lines at @xmath26 ) , but the rest is passed through a double - pass up - shifting aom .",
    "the aom is driven by the frequency difference @xmath27 , where the first portion comes from the same vco driven by the fast port of the pid used to lock to the fc , but before the doubling stage , ( fig.[full_diagram_0 ] ; denoted x2 ) and the second from a dds ( subtracted using a rf mixer ; denoted mix ) .",
    "the useful light after the double - pass aom has the frequency @xmath28 ( panel 3 of fig.[full_diagram_0 ] ) .",
    "the result is a filtered , ultra - tightly locked main beam coming in transmission of the fc with noise dominated only by the cavity s acoustics , and another beam ( the one after the aom ) that is shifted @xmath29 away , which , in the acoustic frequency range , perfectly resembles the primary one .",

    "the system s advantages apart from the above mentioned ones over the standard realizations of such systems include : 1 ) extremely high bw and dynamic range of the fibered eom - nltl system superior to intra - cavity eoms ( which have smaller dynamic range ) or injection current locks ( which have smaller bw and dynamic range and add amplitude noise ) , 2 ) comparatively low optical losses ( mainly due to the nltl ) , 3 ) convenient long - range tuning without the need to optimize aoms when switching to another atomic or molecular line as one simply has to change the dc value @xmath30 and accordingly @xmath31 to be in the convenient range of the aom ( the fast lock to the eom is ac - coupled starting from @xmath32hz ) , 4 ) decreased complexity by a ) achieving tuning , sideband modulation , and locking ( to both fc and rc ) by just one eom and one aom , b ) powering all the components by @xmath33dbm rf amplifiers ( still in the power range where the costs are minimal ) , and c ) using only one actuator , namely the fc pzt , to lock to the rc in view of its high bw ( a small mirror is used and a carefully chosen pzt ) , and 5 ) filtered output by the fc , eliminating stochastic laser noise and unwanted sidebands .",
    "we first discuss the laser housing and mount in detail . it is based on a littrow - type ecdl with a variable cavity length in the range of @xmath34 cm .",
    "the passive stability of the ecdl ( operating with a laser diode eyp - rwe-1060 , eagleyard ) and acoustic immunity are improved in comparison to standard designs by a few simple measures ( fig.[full_anatomy1 ] ) .",
    "first , a commercial diode collimation tube ( lt230p - b , thorlabs ) is partially flattened on two parallel planes and sandwiched between two peltier elements ( te-17 - 1.0 - 2.0 , te tech . ) to control the diode s temperature using a @xmath35 k@xmath36 thermistor ( vishay bccomponents ) .",
    "the overall square - shaped mount ( cm ) serves as a heat sink and as a vertical goniometer .",
    "rotation in the vertical plane ( around axis ax0 ) is necessary to optimize the optical feedback .",
    "it is initiated by vertical precision screws ( vs ) pressing against the floor of the main body .",
    "once aligned , the vertical rotation degree of freedom is frozen by tightening the cm to the sidewall of the laser body @xcite as it is not used in a daily operation .",
    "its contribution therefore to the acoustic noise of the laser is minimized .",
    "the grating ( holographic , number of lines / mm chosen such that @xmath37 ; 33025fl01 - 239h richardson gratings ) is positioned in a cylinder - flexure structure ( cfs ) that is allowed to rotate only in the horizontal plane for tuning the wavelength ( around ax1 ) @xcite .",
    "rough tuning is achieved by a rotation induced by two fine threaded screws ( rs ) ( f3ss10 and n250l3p , thorlabs ) inducing rotation in opposite directions by pushing along the tangent of the cfs ( see fig.[full_anatomy1 ] a ) and c ) for horizontal and vertical views respectively ) .",
    "the screws have ball tips and press against the cfs through two sapphire crystals ( sc , 43 - 627 , edmund ) .",
    "smooth rotation is accomplished by three ball - tip precise screws ( cs ) that press the upper edge of the cylinder , which is wedged at @xmath38 ( fig.[full_anatomy1 ] d ) ) .",
    "this feature also assures that the screws apply a normal downward force component to the cylinder ( f2 ) , therefore guaranteeing rotation only in the horizontal plane .",
    "the cfs contacts the main body only through the ball tips of the three cs and a thin 1 mm wide ring - shaped lip left on the outer edge of its bottom surface ( denoted rl and visible in fig.[full_anatomy1 ] c ) ) . after choosing the rough wavelength the horizontal rotation",
    "is also frozen ( by applying a force on the cfs by both rs ) .",
    "subsequent fine tuning is left to a pzt stack ( pch 150/7x7/2 , piezomechanik ) driving only the flexure ( force f1 on fig.[full_anatomy1 ] b ) ) , designed to have a mechanical frequency at @xmath39khz .",
    "the center of the grating moves @xmath40 m for @xmath41n force applied by the pzt . during flexing the grating experiences a rotation around ax2 .",
    "the cfs is made out of 316 ss .",
    "modeling of the above properties is achieved using a standard cad program with an elastic properties simulation capability . in practice",
    "the resonant frequency is determined by exciting the pzt and sweeping a variable sound generator while observing the noise spectral density of the laser when locked to the fc .",
    "the whole body of the laser is made out of aluminum and is vacuum sealed , allowing it to be evacuated if desired .",
    "it is thermally stabilized by 4 peltier elements ( te-127 - 1.0 - 1.3 , tetech . )",
    "wired in series .",
    "the resistive bridges for both the diode and laser body are attached on the back of the laser for thermal stability and share the layout with the ld filtering circuit .",
    "rough tuning is possible by engaging the two finely threaded screws rs with adapted quick - seal connects qc ( b-025-k , lesker ) , which allows for rotation without breaking vacuum ( applying apiezon vacuum grease on the sealing o - rings experiencing the rotation driven by transmission - seal bar ( tsb ) from outside ) .",
    "the chamber is evacuated through a small inlet ( same as v1021 - 1 , dlh industries ) machined on a kf25 flange , which is economic and does not take much space compared to standard vacuum valves .",
    "the performance of the bare , free - running ecdl without engaging the tight locks to the fc and the rc is characterized by analyzing the frequency noise linear spectral density ( lsd ) of the error signal as shown in fig.[noise_comparison ] when the laser is locked to the fc using only the slow ( @xmath42hz ) servo branch applied to the pzt behind the grating of the ecdl ( the feedback via the eom is not applied ) .",
    "there are no visible mechanical resonances .",
    "the  fast \" linewidth of the laser is @xmath43khz mostly defined by the length of the ecdl cavity . at fourier frequencies",
    "@xmath44khz the spectrum increases from the quantum white noise level due to additional technical noise sources .",
    "the overall rms linewidth is @xmath45khz .",
    "the corresponding allan deviation calculated based on the psd @xmath46 is in the @xmath47khz range for times in the @xmath48s - @xmath35 ms interval .",
    "we now use the fibered eom ( eospace , pm-0k5 - 10-pfa - pfa-980 , 10 ghz bw ) as a fast actuator .",
    "almost @xmath49 of the light is coupled into the eom , additionally spatially filtering the beam and thus delivering a clean gaussian mode .",
    "we note that one typically filters the laser mode with a polarization maintaining ( pm ) fiber ; the presence of the fibered eom therefore eliminates this step .",
    "the light is then directed to the plano - convex fc ( finesse @xmath50 , fsr @xmath51 ghz , spacer made of zerodur square block 30x30x100 mm , helma optics ) with one coupler ( both couplers from layertec , low loss , 12.5 mm diam . ; flat and @xmath52 mm radius ) mounted on two concentric tubular pzt s ( meggit , f3270154 , f3270055 ) compensating their thermal drifts ( fig.[full_anatomy1 ] ; pztt ) .",
    "the fc is placed in a v - groove and held in place by 8 viton o - rings ( @xmath53 mm od ) positioned closely under and above the diagonal - mid plane ( top clamps visible on fig.[full_anatomy1 ] ) .",
    "almost @xmath54 of the light is coupled into the fc on resonance .",
    "the eom is driven by a nltl 7013 ( tactron inc . , produced by picosecond pulse inc . ,",
    "operating range @xmath55 mhz , higher than the specifications ) , which converts the signal from the vco ( vco ros-625 - 219 + , mini - circuits ) into a sawtooth - shaped signal @xcite . when fourier transformed the signal of the nltl driven at frequency @xmath56",
    "is composed of a comb of frequencies with power scaling roughly as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the fourier index .",
    "once the amplitude of the sawtooth signal becomes equal to the @xmath59 voltage of the eom ( i.e. 3 - 4 v ) , the modulated phase has an effectively linear time dependence and therefore most of the light power ( @xmath60 ) is diffracted either into the upper or into the lower sideband spaced at @xmath61 ( 500 - 1300 mhz ) away from the carrier .",
    "this sideband can be tuned with @xmath62 db bw of @xmath63 mhz limited by the vco bw and with a dynamic range of @xmath64 mhz .",
    "this allows for an extremely fast and easy to operate lock with a closed loop bw that can be pushed to @xmath65 mhz , limited primarily by phase delays in the pid ( see fig.[full_diagram_electronics ] a ) and c ) for a schematic ) and cable length .",
    "the fc is positioned in the same body as the ecdl to minimize space and costs .",
    "the whole chamber is covered with silicon ( smooth - on mold max 15 t ) for damping acoustic air - born noise @xcite .",
    "the sidebands needed for the pdh lock are imprinted by a @xmath66-mhz wave provided by a fixed dds ( ad9858 ) right before the nltl ( power splitters resp .",
    "combiners are adp-2 - 20 - 75 , mini - circuits ) .",
    "these sidebands pass the nltl unaltered",
    ". one could perform the mixing after the nltl with a resistive combiner , but then a @xmath67 db loss is added and the @xmath59 of the eom can barely be reached . in reflection @xmath16 of the light",

    "the fast correction is applied to the voltage - controlled port of the vco .",
    "the slow correction ( @xmath68 hz ) goes to the grating piezo ( pzt ) of the ecdl . at this point",

    "the differential input amplifier stage consists of two unity gain buffers ( ada4899 - 1 , @xmath72 mhz gbwp , @xmath73 lsd ) and a subtracting high bw amplifier ( lmh6624 , @xmath74 ghz gbwp , @xmath75 lsd ) with a fixed voltage gain of @xmath76 db .",
    "this configuration ensures a high input impedance optimal for signals coming from phase - detectors and a high usable signal bw while keeping the overall noise level low .",
    "next a variable attenuator stage allows for a reduction of gain if necessary . additionally one can choose between ac and dc coupling of the signal ( corner frequency @xmath77 hz ) .",
    "the first ( slow ) integrator stage has a fixed corner frequency of @xmath35 khz .",
    "the maximum voltage gain for low frequencies reaches @xmath78 db , the gain in the proportional region is fixed to @xmath67 db .",
    "the amplifier that we use ( ada4817 - 1 , @xmath79 ghz gbwp , @xmath80 lsd ) has fet - input stages , ensuring negligible changes in the offset voltage in the whole integral gain region .",
    "the full pid stage , using the same amplifier as the slow integrator stage , uses dip - switches to set the corner frequencies of the d- and i - part by changing the corresponding capacitances .",
    "the p - part has a fixed attenuation of @xmath81 db , ensuring that the d - part with a maximum of @xmath67 db gain is within a frequency region where the bandwidth of the amplifier is no limitation .",
    "the available corner frequencies of the i - part with a maximum gain of @xmath76 db are limited to low frequencies such that no overlap with the first ( slow ) integrator could lead to instabilities due to high phase shifts .",
    "a full - scale output offset can be added within the last stage ( ths3091 , @xmath82 mhz bandwidth , @xmath83 lsd ) , which also serves as an output buffer able to provide up to @xmath84 ma current .",
    "overall , all electronic parts , especially the amplifiers , are chosen carefully to allow a maximum electronic bandwidth of several tens of mhz such that phase shifts due to the amplifiers of the pid circuit are negligible in the overall pid , thereby not limiting the feedback bw .",
    "bode plots showing the performance of our circuitry are given in fig .",

    "next , for better absolute stability , we reference the laser to a highly stable rc without any additional components other than a single aom ( fig.[full_diagram_0 ] ) . a dc voltage in the range of about @xmath91 v is added to the correction signal of the pid to tune the laser to a desired average position relative to the carrier @xmath22 .",
    "the light reflected from the fc contains non - diffracted light at the frequency of the ecdl carrying sidebands at @xmath66 mhz ( see panel 2 of fig.[full_diagram_0 ] ) .",
    "note that this light still has the noise of the ecdl .",

    "the aom is driven by a portion of the radio - frequency signal that comes from the vco and that is mixed with the signal at @xmath31 from a dds , resulting in an approximately @xmath92-mhz drive within the range of the aom ( @xmath31 is chosen accordingly ) .",
    "the aom is not a part of the closed loop but since it is driven by the radio - frequency that contains the frequency excursions of the ecdl relative to the fc , it corrects the frequency excursions within its bandwidth .",
    "the light after the aom is shifted by @xmath29 with respect to the light transmitted through the fc ( see panel 3 of fig.[full_diagram_0 ] ) . in comparison to the fc - transmitted beam",
    "it has enhanced noise beyond the aom s bandwidth ( which is typically @xmath84 khz ) .",
    "this , however , is irrelevant to the lock to the rc as the only noise that needs to be compensated for comes from the acoustic noise of the fc .    in fig.[beat_comparison ]",

    "the laser linewidth relative to the rc is now sub - hz , although this estimate is based purely on the lsd of the pdh error signal and does not include a possible residual amplitude modulation ( ram ) at the pdh frequency . choosing a smaller ( i.e. lighter ) cavity mirror and a fc pzt with a smaller inner diameter",

    "<S> we report on a design of a compact laser system composed of an extended cavity diode laser with high passive stability and a pre - filter fabri - perot cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the laser is frequency stabilized relative to the cavity using a serrodyne technique with a correction bandwidth of @xmath0 mhz and a dynamic range of @xmath1 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the free running laser system has a power spectral density ( psd ) @xmath2 hz@xmath3/hz centered mainly in the acoustic frequency range . a highly tunable , @xmath4 ghz copy of the spectrally pure output beam </S>",
    "<S> is provided , which can be used for further stabilization of the laser system to an ultra - stable reference . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a simple one - channel lock to such a reference that brings down the psd to the sub - hz level . </S>",
    "<S> the tuning , frequency stabilization and sideband imprinting is achieved by a minimum number of key elements comprising a fibered eom ( electro - optic modulator ) , aom ( acousto - optic modulator ) and a nltl ( non - linear transmission line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the system is easy to operate , scalable , and highly applicable to atomic / molecular experiments demanding high spectral purity , long - term stability , and robustness . </S>"
