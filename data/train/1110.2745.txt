    "most of the dense molecular gas in galaxies is assembled into giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) with masses from 10@xmath15 m@xmath6 to 10@xmath16 m@xmath6 and radii from 50 pc to a few hundred pc ( e.g. , fukui & kawamura 2010 ) .",
    "as stars , the `` atoms '' of galaxies , are exclusively formed in these gmcs , physical processes that govern the conversion of hi into h@xmath0 clearly play an important role in determining the properties of gmcs and consequently the initial conditions for star formation .",
    "therefore , understanding the properties of the interstellar regions where gas transitions from h@xmath17h@xmath0-dominated ( hi  h@xmath0 transition hereafter ) is an important step toward a complete theory of star formation .    from an observational point of view , the hi ",
    "transition has been investigated in the galaxy mainly via ultraviolet ( uv ) absorption measurements toward background sources .",
    "for example , savage et al .",
    "( 1977 ) and gillmon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) measured h@xmath0 column densities , @xmath18(h@xmath0 ) , along the lines of sight to early - type stars and agns using the _ copernicus _ and _ fuse _ satellites and combined them with hi column densities , @xmath18(hi ) , to estimate h@xmath0 fraction , @xmath19 = 2@xmath18(h@xmath0)/(@xmath18(hi@xmath20(h@xmath0 ) ) .",
    "they found that @xmath19 sharply rises at @xmath18(h ) = @xmath18(hi@xmath20(h@xmath0 ) @xmath3 ( 35 ) @xmath11 10@xmath12 cm@xmath7 .",
    "several far - infrared ( fir ) studies of interstellar clouds have revealed the presence of h@xmath0 based on the comparison between dust and atomic gas contents ( e.g. , reach et al .",
    "1994 ; meyerdierks & heithausen 1996 ; douglas & taylor 2007 ) .",
    "reach et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found a significant positive deviation from a linear relation between ir intensity at 100 @xmath21 m and @xmath18(hi ) for cirrus clouds , indicating a substantial amount of h@xmath0 .",
    "the threshold @xmath18(hi ) at which @xmath18(h@xmath0 ) implied by the fir data becomes significant was found to be @xmath34 @xmath11 10@xmath12 cm@xmath7 , consistent with the results from savage et al .",
    "( 1977 ) and gillmon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "more recently , the hi  h@xmath0 transition has been observationally inferred by an absence of high @xmath18(hi ) . for example , barriault et al . ( 2010 ) observed two high galactic latitude clouds in the oh and hi transitions and found that @xmath18(hi ) saturates at @xmath35 @xmath11 10@xmath12 cm@xmath7 for high values of @xmath18(oh ) , suggesting that there is molecular gas not traced by hi .",
    "extragalactic studies have found this saturation as well .",
    "wong & blitz ( 2002 ) , blitz & rosolowsky ( 2004 , 2006 ) , bigiel et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and wong et al .",
    "( 2009 ) observed nearby galaxies in the co and hi transitions and found that hi surface density , @xmath1 , saturates at @xmath310 m@xmath6 pc@xmath7 .",
    "most extragalactic studies have a spatial resolution of @xmath3700 pc at best , where most gmcs are unresolved and several are likely to be blended along a line of sight .",
    "in addition , at this resolution it is impossible to compare h@xmath0 with the corresponding hi associated with the cloud envelopes .    from a theoretical point of view , the hi  h@xmath0 transition has been studied in the context of the structure of photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) . as uv photons filling up the bulk of the interstellar medium ( ism ) photodissociate h@xmath0 , predominantly molecular gas is only found in the dense regions where high enough shielding is achieved by both dust grains and h@xmath0 self - shielding .",
    "these molecular regions are bounded by pdrs where the gas predominantly exists in the atomic phase ( e.g. , hollenbach & tielens 1997 ) .",
    "the structure of pdrs has been mainly investigated for 1d geometries that include uni - directional or bi - directional beams of radiation propagating into semi - infinite slabs or purely radial radiation fields hitting the surfaces of spherical clouds ( e.g. , van dishoeck & black 1986 ; draine & bertoldi 1996 ; browning et al . 2003 ) . however , this 1d approximation is not appropriate for gmcs that are embedded in a radiation field produced by the combination of many single stars and star clusters .",
    "in addition , when gmcs are surrounded by large hi envelopes , which have been frequently observed in the galaxy ( e.g. , wannier et al . 1983 , 1991 ) , the curvature of the pdrs and the finite size of the molecular regions are no longer negligible .",
    "a higher dimensional approach is required in this case , but as it requires a treatment of the angular dependence of the radiation field , all previous studies have been purely numerical ( e.g. , spaans & neufeld 1997 ; liszt & lucas 2000 ; liszt 2002 ) .",
    "these numerical studies do not provide a simple analytic estimate of the structure of pdrs that allows us to extrapolate the models over a wide range of ism environments and to easily compare with observations .",
    "recently , krumholz et al . ( 2008 , 2009 ; kmt08 and kmt09 hereafter ) performed analytic studies on a pdr in a spherical cloud that is bathed in a uniform and isotropic interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .",
    "they investigated the steady - state equilibrium formation and photodissociation of h@xmath0 and approximated the hi ",
    "h@xmath0 transition as being infinitely sharp .",
    "their calculation of where exactly inside a molecular cloud this transition happens resulted in two important analytic predictions .",
    "first , they found that a certain amount of @xmath1 is required to provide enough shielding for h@xmath0 formation .",
    "for gmcs with solar metallicity , this is @xmath1 @xmath3 10 m@xmath6 pc@xmath7 . once the minimum @xmath1 is achieved to shield h@xmath0 against photodissociation , all excess hi is converted into h@xmath0 and the h@xmath0 abundance increases .",
    "second , they derived an analytic function for h@xmath0-to - hi ratio , @xmath22 = @xmath2/@xmath1 , and showed that @xmath22 depends on the total gas surface density and metallicity but is interestingly almost independent of the strength of the isrf . this is a very powerful prediction , suggesting that for a given ism environment , the total gas surface density determines the h@xmath0-to - hi ratio . if confirmed by observations , this `` easy '' prescription of h@xmath0 formation will be invaluable for numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution . from a purely practical perspective , as the above predictions are functions of direct observables ( total gas surface density and metallicity ) , they are much easier to test observationally .",
    "most of the previous models of h@xmath0 formation ( e.g. , van dishoeck & black 1986 ; draine & bertoldi 1996 ; browning et al . 2003 ) require the intensity of the uv radiation field and the number density of h nuclei as input parameters , which can not be easily determined by observations .",
    "kmt09 s predictions specifically focus on the properties of gmcs on galactic scales ( @xmath3kpc ) .",
    "several recent studies investigated the hi and h@xmath0 properties of nearby spiral and dwarf galaxies on kpc scales and found reasonable agreement with kmt09 s prediction of @xmath22 as a function of total gas surface density and metallicity ( e.g. , kmt09 ; fumagalli et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ) . on the other hand , kmt09 s simplified treatment of the thermal and chemical processes in pdrs may be less suited for studies of individual pdrs .",
    "for example , kmt09 s model does not consider the temperature dependence of h@xmath0 formation rate coefficients , h@xmath0 dissociation by cosmic rays , or absorption of lyman - werner ( lw ) photons by molecules other than h@xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , kmt09 s model provides strong physical insights into the fundamental principles of h@xmath0 formation .    in this paper",
    ", we test kmt09 s predictions on the perseus molecular cloud ( perseus hereafter ) on sub - pc scales ( @xmath30.4 pc ) for the first time in an attempt to understand the fundamental principles of h@xmath0 formation in gmcs .",
    "perseus is a nearby molecular cloud located at a distance ranging from 200 pc to 350 pc ( herbig & jones 1983 ; ernis 1990 ) and has roughly a projected angular size of 6@xmath23 by 3@xmath23 on the sky ( based on co emissionco(10 ) data are quoted as co. ] ) .",

    "one of the recent observational advances is the high resolution hi data set of perseus and its outskirts provided by the galfa  hi survey ( peek et al .",
    "this data set nicely matches the angular resolution of fir images , @xmath34@xmath26 , allowing us to estimate @xmath22 across and around perseus and to compare the results to kmt09 s predictions .",

    "we start with a description of the data sets used in this study ( section 2 ) .",

    ", we compare our @xmath1 and @xmath22 images with kmt09 s predictions .",
    "we then compare the derived h@xmath0 distribution with the existing co observations and investigate the existence of the `` co - dark '' h@xmath0 gas ( section 8) .",

    "full details of gsr are presented in peek et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , but here we briefly describe its most important steps .",
    "first , hi spectra are corrected for the intermediate frequency ( if ) gain by dividing them by a reference spectrum .",
    "this reference spectrum is obtained via the least - squares frequency switching ( lsfs ) technique ( heiles 2005 ) .",
    "the lsfs observation is performed at the beginning of each observing period and the obtained if gain spectrum is used for the whole period s data .",
    "second , the hi spectra are searched for baseline ripples produced by reflections in the signal chain , the primary reflector , and the gregorian dome .",
    "this initial calibration is done by examining the hi data in the fourier space and removing the fourier components that correspond to the reflection patterns .",
    "third , the gain calibration is applied to the hi spectra .",
    "the relative gains of each beam over each day of observations are determined by finding the points where beam tracks intersect and comparing the hi spectra of each beam .",
    "this gain calibration is most effective for the scans obtained in the basketweaving mode , where a large number of intersection points are produced .",
    "lastly , the fully calibrated hi spectra are gridded onto the image plane in cartesian coordinates .",
    "the gridded hi data are then calibrated for the first sidelobe and the final brightness temperature scale .",
    "the lower angular resolution hi data from the leiden ",
    "argentine  bonn ( lab ) survey ( kalberla et al . 2005 ) are used for the final brightness temperature calibration .",
    "the galfa ",
    "hi first data release ( dr1 ) has been presented by peek et al .",
    "the dr1 data cover 7520 deg@xmath31 of sky and have been produced using 3046 hours of data obtained from 12 individual projects .",
    "rms noise in a 1 km s@xmath27 channel ranges from 140 mk to 60 mk , with a median of 80 mk .",
    "the dr1 data can be downloaded at https://purcell.ssl.berkeley.edu/. the hi data used in this paper are part of dr1 and have been obtained from togs2 ( turn - on galfa spectrometer2 ; pi : c. heiles & s. stanimirovi ) , a2004 ( hi survey of the taurus molecular cloud ; pi : p. goldsmith ) , and a2174 ( hi survey of the perseus molecular cloud ; pi : l. knee )",
    ". we combined the scans from these three projects and produced an hi cube centered at ( ra , dec ) = ( 03@xmath3229@xmath3352@xmath34,@xmath3530@xmath3634@xmath261@xmath37 ) in j2000 with a size of 14.8@xmath36 @xmath11 9@xmath36 .",

    "this image was constructed from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog using the nicer algorithm ( lombardi & alves 2001 ) at an angular resolution of 5@xmath26 .",
    "the nicer algorithm estimates reddening along a line of sight by comparing the observed colors of background stars to the intrinsic colors ( measured in a nearby control field , where the extinction is negligible ) .",
    "note that this method does not assume a grain - size distribution or dust emissivity and therefore provides the most reliable estimate of the total gas column density in a molecular cloud ( e.g. , goodman et al .",
    "2009 ; gps09 hereafter ) . in this paper , however , we do not directly use the 2mass @xmath48 image to derive the total gas column density because it only covers the central region of perseus , while we are mainly interested in the cloud outskirts .",
    "instead , we use the 2mass @xmath48 image to calibrate our @xmath49 image derived from the iris data ( see section 4.4 ) .      in this paper , we combine the data sets described above in several ways . in each case",
    ", we first bring all input data sets to common angular resolution determined by the lowest angular resolution data set .",
    "this is done by performing convolution with an appropriate gaussian kernel .",
    "for example , to determine the velocity range of hi emission based on the correlation between @xmath18(hi ) and the dust column density , we smooth the hi data to the angular resolution of the 2mass @xmath48 image , 5@xmath26 ( section 3.2 ) . to derive @xmath18(h@xmath0 ) , the iris and hi data are convolved with a gaussian kernel to have an angular resolution of 4.3@xmath26 .",
    "consequently , our final @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath22 images have an angular resolution of 4.3@xmath26 ( sections 4.5 and 7 ) .",
    "the main component of the hi emission in perseus is centered at @xmath29 = @xmath50 km s@xmath27 .",
    "compared to the molecular gas traced by co , the peak of the hi emission is offset by 23 km s@xmath27 . as an example , we compare the hi and co spectra at the position of ic348 in figure [ f : hi_co_spectra ] .",
    "there are ( at least ) two components in the hi spectrum and the stronger one peaks at @xmath51 @xmath355 km s@xmath27 .",
    "interestingly , the location of the dip between the two hi components corresponds to the co peak at @xmath51 @xmath358 km s@xmath27 .",
    "this dip is likely from hi self - absorption ( hisa ) and indicates the presence of very cold neutral medium ( spin temperature @xmath52 k ; e.g. , gibson 2010 ) .",
    "the correction for hisa requires a knowledge of the relative contributions from cold and warm gas to the hi emission , which can be obtained via hi absorption measurements .",
    "however , only two hi absorption measurements exist for perseus ( e.g. , heiles & troland 2003a ) .",
    "this is clearly too sparse to interpolate the relative contributions from cold and warm gas throughout the whole molecular cloud .",
    "therefore , we do not apply the correction for hisa to @xmath18(hi ) but we investigate the optical depth effect in section 7.1.1 by applying the first order opacity correction .",
    "to determine the velocity range of hi emission associated with perseus , we investigate the correlation between @xmath18(hi ) and the dust column density .",
    "the correlation between hi emission and fir emission has been well - established for high galactic latitudes ( e.g. , boulanger et al .",

    "therefore , the purely atomic envelopes are likely located more than @xmath320 pc from the molecular peaks .      an alternative or additional explanation for the relatively constant @xmath1 we measured could be a high optical depth of hi in perseus . if hi gas is optically thick , the measured brightness temperature @xmath58 levels off at a temperature close to the kinetic temperature @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , under the assumption of optically thin hi gas ( which we used to calculate our @xmath1 ) , @xmath1 would saturate as @xmath1 @xmath157 @xmath58 @xmath3 @xmath181 and therefore be underestimated .",
    "there are a few lines of evidence that indicate the presence of cold , optically thick cnm in perseus .",

    "the effect of optical depth is to measure cnm in absorption in the direction of many background radio sources behind perseus .",
    "this provides the total column density of atomic hydrogen gas ( @xmath183 ) along each line of sight , which can be compared with the column density we measured in section 3.2 to derive the optical depth corrections for the whole cloud .",
    "as only two such measurements exist so far , we are in the process of obtaining additional hi absorption measurements . here",
    "we investigate only the magnitude of the optical depth effect .",
    "if we assume @xmath184 = 70 k as measured by heiles & troland ( 2003b ) , the corrected @xmath18(hi ) will need to be calculated using the following equation : @xmath185    if we apply this equation to our @xmath18(hi ) image , we find that @xmath1 changes by a factor of 1.22 .",
    "another approach involves using the statistics of cnm and wnm from heiles & troland ( 2003b ) .",
    "their table 1 summarizes the cnm and wnm column densities for all sources in their survey .",
    "we can then estimate the fraction of cnm column density ( relative to the total column density ) as a function of wnm column density .",
    "using only the table entries for a region centered on perseus and @xmath31200 deg@xmath31 in size , we find that the cnm fraction is close to 50% for wnm column density less than 1.2 @xmath11 10@xmath59 cm@xmath7 .",
    "this again suggests that our @xmath18(hi ) or @xmath1 could be underestimated by a factor of two .",
    "our excercise shows that a high optical depth along each line of sight could result in a factor of two spread in @xmath1 for perseus .",
    "this is not substantial and therefore the almost constant @xmath1 we measured is likely a real physical feature , possibly driven by the conversion of hi into h@xmath0 .",

    "we use the @xmath2 image derived from our adopted dgr , 1.1 @xmath11 10@xmath108 mag cm@xmath31 . in table 3 , we list the estimated @xmath14 and @xmath221 for the four regions .",
    "we find @xmath14 @xmath3 0.3 for regions 1 and 2 and @xmath14 = 0.10.2 for regions 3 and 4 .",
    "all regions have similar mean extinction , @xmath221 = 1.41.7 mag .",
    "while we have only four data points covering a small range of @xmath221 , we measure a relatively large range of @xmath14 , from @xmath30.1 to @xmath30.3 .",
    "the large variation we find in @xmath14 is not consistent with whm10 , but echos the observations of other diffuse clouds in the galaxy .",
    "for example , the polaris cloud has @xmath241 0.3 mag ( heithausen & thaddeus 1990 ) and @xmath243 0.36 ( abdo et al .",
    "2010 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the pegasus cloud has @xmath241 0.6 mag ( yamamoto et al .",
    "2006 ) and @xmath243 0.6 ( grenier et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "this region - to - region variation we find in @xmath14 could be due to the dgr systematically changing across perseus .",
    "for example , a factor of two lower dgr would allow regions 3 and 4 to have similar @xmath14 as regions 1 and 2 .",
    "however , we do not find any evidence for such systematic change of the dgr when examining the correlation between @xmath18(hi ) and fir emission ( see section 4.2 ) . as an alternative",
    ", the complicated viewing geometry of the h@xmath0 and co distributions could result in the regional variation in @xmath14 .",
    "the excellent agreement between our data and kmt09 s predictions ( sections 7.1 and 7.2 ) suggests that kmt09 s model captures the fundamental physics of h@xmath0 formation reasonably well even on sub - pc scales .",
    "this is certainly encouraging , but slightly surprising considering how simple kmt09 s model is .",
    "essentially , for a spherical cloud bathed in a uniform and isotropic isrf , the most important factor for h@xmath0 formation is the hi shielding surface density @xmath149 . once enough shielding against photodissociation",
    "is achieved by @xmath149 , all additional @xmath1 is fully converted into @xmath2 , resulting in a uniform @xmath1 distribution and therefore a linear increase of @xmath2 with @xmath9 .    before going into a more detailed discussion of several important aspects of kmt09 s model , we would like to remind the reader that two main predictions summarized in section 6 are not independent .",
    "the predicted behavior of @xmath22 as a function of @xmath9 is a consequence of saturation of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the excellent agreement between our data and kmt09 s predictions in figure 12 is entirely driven by the constant @xmath1 .",
    "while we are not able to probe the purely atomic envelope of perseus , the constant @xmath1 of 68 m@xmath6 pc@xmath7 we find is in agreement with kmt09 s prediction of @xmath149 for solar metallicity .",
    "in addition , we caution that our data do not allow us to fully test the dependence of @xmath22 on metallicity and isrf .",
    "kmt09 s model predicts that @xmath22 depends on metallicity , while being almost insensitive to the strength of isrf .",
    "while our findings are in agreement with kmt09 s predictions for solar metallicity and @xmath32/5 of the galactic isrf , the lack of metallicity and isrf variations across perseus does not permit more detailed model testing .",
    "future studies of high - latitude molecular clouds and gmcs in external galaxies with sub - solar metallicity will provide crucial tests of kmt09 s model .",
    "we now turn to several crucial model assumptions and discuss their possible limitations .",
    "the most fundamental principle underlying kmt09 s model is h@xmath0 formation in equilibrium . in equilibrium , h@xmath0 formation and photodissociation",
    "are balanced and h@xmath0 abundance is locally constant .",
    "several authors have investigated the time evolution of h@xmath0 and found a typical timescale of h@xmath0 formation in equilibrium , @xmath246 = 1030 myr ( e.g. , goldsmith et al .",
    "2007 ; liszt 2007 )    as @xmath246 is comparable to or longer than the estimated lifetime of gmcs , @xmath247 myr ( mckee & ostriker 2007 and references therein ) , the role of interstellar turbulence in accelerating h@xmath0 formation has received significant attention in recent years ( e.g. , hartmann et al .",
    "2001 ; bergin et al .",
    "2004 ; glover & mac low 2007 ; glover et al .",
    "the main idea behind the models of h@xmath0 formation in turbulent media is that shocks induced by cloud  cloud collisions , spiral density waves , supernovae explosions , etc . ,",
    "compress diffuse atomic gas , allowing h@xmath0 to form in the postshock gas where high enough shielding is achieved against photodissociation . while earlier studies have been limited to 1d , glover & mac low ( 2007 ) and glover et al .",
    "( 2010 ) performed 3d magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations of turbulence with detailed chemical modeling .",
    "they showed that a significant amount of h@xmath0 could form within 12 myr , due to the turbulence - driven clumping that accelerates h@xmath0 formation .",
    "however , the h@xmath0 abundance keeps increasing over time and never reaches equilibrium by 2030 myr .",
    "eventually , the gas will become fully molecular unless the h@xmath0 formation is terminated by destruction of gmcs via stellar feedback , e.g. , photoevaporation by hii regions and protostellar outflows .",
    "this sharply contrasts with kmt09 s model .",
    "our results are consistent with the model of h@xmath0 formation in equilibrium and suggest that turbulence may play a secondary role in the h@xmath0 formation .",
    "clearly , further studies are needed to compare abundances of h@xmath0 and other molecular species with the predictions from both stationary and turbulent models .",
    "we find that @xmath1 is uniform across perseus with a range of 68 m@xmath6 pc@xmath7 , consistent with kmt09 s prediction of @xmath149 for solar metallicity .",
    "however , as cnm is far more effective at shielding against photodissociation than wnm , the predicted @xmath149 comes purely from cnm , while our measured @xmath1 includes the contributions from both cnm and wnm .",
    "as we discussed in section 7.1.1 , our measured @xmath1 could be underestimated by a factor of two for high optical depth gas ( cnm ) .",
    "while @xmath1 corrected for high optical depth would likely still be comparable to kmt09 s prediction , the importance of wnm in the envelopes of atomic - molecular complexes clearly needs to be taken into account in the models of h@xmath0 formation .",
    "this is also supported by bolatto et al .",
    "( 2011 ) who found a relatively good agreement between kmt09 s prediction and the observed @xmath22 vs @xmath248 in the small magellanic cloud , where wnm dominates the total hi ( dickey et al . 2000 ) . at the same time",
    ", it is essential to observationally constrain the relative contribution from cnm and wnm to @xmath1 .",
    "we are in the process of obtaining hi absorption measurements for perseus , which will allow us to separate the contributions from cold and warm gas .",
    "as we showed in section 5.2 , in the case of ic348 and ngc1333 , the embedded b - type stars are the dominant sources of the radiation field .",
    "s model does not take into account the role of internal radiation in determining @xmath22 , with the assumption that massive stars producing significant amounts of dissociating photons do not stay inside their parent molecular clouds for a long time .",
    "while we clearly see the importance of the b - type stars for dust heating , we find no significant difference in our analysis of @xmath22 for the dark and star - forming regions .",
    "this supports the idea that the internal radiation is not important for h@xmath0 formation .",
    "however , as we show below , this is valid for perseus because it does not contain any stars earlier than the b5 v - type .",
    "when o- or b - type stars suddenly turn on in a molecular cloud , uv photons from the stars photodissociate h@xmath0 and create hi dissociation regions around hii regions .",
    "this variation of the uv radiation field has a much shorter timescale ( @xmath310@xmath249 yr ) than h@xmath0 formation ( @xmath310@xmath16 yr ) and therefore totally changes the thermal and chemical structures of the molecular cloud ( e.g. , hollenbach & natta 1995 ; bertoldi & draine 1996 ) .",
    "however , the sphere of photodissociation influence depends greatly on the stellar type .",
    "roger & dewdney ( 1992 ) studied the properties of hi dissociation regions around o- and b - type main sequence stars .",
    "their source list includes svs3 , the b5 v - type star in ngc1333 ( red star in figure [ f : dust_map ] ) .",
    "an hi region associated with svs3 was measured to have @xmath250 = 0.017 m@xmath6 and @xmath251 = 0.03 pc ( rodrguez et al .",
    "this is consistent with an hi dissociation region created by a star of @xmath252 k in a dense medium of @xmath253 @xmath128 .",
    "the size of the hi dissociation region around this particular b5 star is only @xmath31/10 of our spatial resolution .",
    "therefore , the hi dissociation regions around the individual b - type stars in perseus are below our spatial resolution and therefore are negligible for our consideration of @xmath22 .",
    "however , the internal radiation is still important for dust heating inside ic348 and ngc1333 .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that not every uv photon produces photodissociation of h@xmath0 . while uv and visible photons heat dust grains , only the uv photons in the narrower lw band ( 9121120  ) photodissociate h@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , only @xmath310% of the lw photons actually photodissociate h@xmath0 ( @xmath254 ) .",
    "therefore , the uv photons from the b - type stars in ic348 and ngc1333 could be dominant for dust heating , while relatively ineffective for photodissociation of h@xmath0 .",
    "if any stars earlier than b3 v resided in perseus , on the other hand , the role of the internal radiation in determining @xmath22 would be no longer negligible .",
    "for example , roger & dewdney ( 1992 ) found that an hi region associated with iras 23545@xmath356508 has @xmath250 = 1.4 m@xmath6 and @xmath251 = 0.4 pc and these properties are consistent with an hi dissociation region created by a b3 v type star in a medium of @xmath255 @xmath128 .",
    "the size of the hi dissociation region is now comparable to our spatial resolution and therefore @xmath22 around the stars earlier than b3 v would be significantly modified .",
    "therefore , depending on the stellar type of stars residing inside gmcs , the internal radiation should not be ignored .",
    "in this paper , we study the hi  h@xmath0 transition across the perseus molecular cloud on sub - pc scales ( @xmath30.4 pc ) .",
    "we use the highest resolution hi data for perseus from the galfa  hi survey , which allow us to probe the outskirts as well as the main body of the cloud .",
    "the velocity range of the hi emission associated with perseus is determined based on the correlation between @xmath18(hi ) and the dust column density traced by the 2mass @xmath48 image .",
    "we then derive the @xmath18(hi ) image under the assumption of optically thin hi gas .",
    "the dust column density is estimated using the iris 60 @xmath21 m and 100 @xmath21 m images and is calibrated with the 2mass @xmath48 image . in combination with the @xmath18(hi ) image and the derived dgr , we use the dust column density to derive the @xmath18(h@xmath0 ) image .",
    "the @xmath18(hi ) and @xmath18(h@xmath0 ) images and the existing co data for perseus allow us to test two recent models of h@xmath0 and co formation in equilibrium . for several dark and star - forming regions ( b5 , b1e , b1 , ic348 , and ngc1333 )",
    ", we investigate @xmath1 and @xmath22 as a function of @xmath9 and compare the results to kmt09 s predictions .",
    "we also compare the h@xmath0 and co distributions and estimate the fraction of h@xmath0 mass in the `` co - dark '' component , @xmath14 .",
    "we investigate @xmath14 as a function of @xmath221 and compare the result to whm10 s prediction .",
    "several of the main results can be summarized as follows :    \\1 . for both dark and star - forming regions in perseus",
    ", we find an almost uniform @xmath1 @xmath3 68 m@xmath6 pc@xmath7 .",
    "this is consistent with kmt09 s prediction of the hi shielding surface density for solar metallicity ,",
    "@xmath256 m@xmath6 pc@xmath7 .    \\2 .",
    "the purely atomic envelopes are located more than @xmath320 pc from the centers of the dark and star - forming regions .",
    "we probe the @xmath1 and @xmath9 distributions up to @xmath32030 pc from the centers of the regions and barely detect the turnover between atomic- and molecular - dominated zones for ic348 , b1e , and b1 .",
    "the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath9 on a log - linear scale is remarkably consistent for all dark and star - forming regions , having a very sharp rise of @xmath22 at low @xmath9 , a turnover around @xmath22 @xmath3 1 , and a slow increase toward higher @xmath22 .",
    "the dark and star - forming regions have similar @xmath156 = 610 , which implies that these regions are embedded in the atomic envelopes with @xmath139 = 2030 @xmath128 .",
    "in addition , @xmath156 = 610 indicates a similar normalized radiation field @xmath257 , suggesting that dust shielding and h@xmath0 self - shielding are equally important for h@xmath0 formation .",
    "we measure the hi ",
    "h@xmath0 transition gas column density of @xmath258 = ( 814 ) @xmath11 10@xmath12 cm@xmath7 or @xmath248 = 612 m@xmath6 pc@xmath7 at @xmath22 @xmath3 0.25 .",
    "this is consistent with the previous estimates for the galaxy .",
    "we estimate the fraction of `` co - dark '' gas , @xmath259 , for perseus , a factor of three lower than whm10 s prediction .",
    "this implies that a significant amount of h@xmath0 gas is not traced by galactic co surveys .",
    "we investigate the dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath221 and find a relatively large variation of @xmath14 @xmath3 0.10.3 for similar @xmath260 mag .",
    "this is not consistent with whm10 s prediction that @xmath14 is a strong function of @xmath221 .",
    "while we generally find good agreement with kmt09 s predictions , several outstanding questions remain .",
    "our estimated @xmath1 @xmath3 68 m@xmath6 pc@xmath7 is likely dominated by wnm , while kmt09 s model predicts shielding by cnm alone .",
    "clearly , the wnm in the atomic envelopes of gmcs needs to be considered in the models of h@xmath0 formation as a source of shielding against photodissociation .",
    "the importance of gravitationally bound vs diffuse gas is another important aspect , as explored in ostriker et al .",
    "in addition , kmt09 s model does not take into account the role of internal radiation for h@xmath0 formation .",
    "this is valid for perseus as it does not contain early - type stars to photodissociate a significant amount of h@xmath0 that could be detected at our spatial resolution .",
    "however , if gmcs are young enough to harbor early - type stars that are able to change the thermal and chemical structures of the gmcs , the internal radiation can not be ignored .",
    "most importantly , our perseus data on sub - pc scales are consistent with kmt09 s model for h@xmath0 formation in equilibrium and suggest that turbulence may not be of primary importance for h@xmath0 formation . yet , the timescale for equilibrium h@xmath0 formation is longer than the estimated lifetime of most gmcs .",
    "this problem remains to be resolved .",
    "future detailed comparisons of observations with non - equilibrium , turbulence - driven h@xmath0 formation models will be important to investigate the role of turbulence for formation of h@xmath0 and various molecular species .",
