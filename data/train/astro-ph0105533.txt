    "in this paper we present a reliable but compact approximation to the high temperature cooling coefficient of heavy elements in diffuse plasmas under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "such an approximation is essential for use with multi - dimensional hydrodynamics codes where the additional burden of following the details of ionization evolution severely restricts the available spatial resolution .    with only a few exceptions , large hydrodynamic models that incorporate radiative cooling",
    "characterize the cooling coefficient with a single parameter , the temperature , @xmath1 , where the total emissivity per unit volume is @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the electron and hydrogen densities .",
    "these cooling functions are determined by assuming either that the ionization state at a given temperature is characterized by collisional equilibrium , or that all gas follows a particular pre - calculated ionization history ( shapiro & moore 1976 ; edgar & chevalier 1983 ; sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .    because the cooling of a plasma depends on the ionization history of the constituent ions , there",
    "can actually be a large range in the value of @xmath5  at a given @xmath6 , depending upon the details of the ionization evolution .",
    "we demonstrate , however , that cooling due to trace elements ( those heavier than helium ) can be approximated by following the evolution of just a single additional parameter , the mean charge on the trace ions , @xmath7 .",
    "here , z is the element number , z is the ionic charge , @xmath8 is the ( linear ) abundance of element z relative to hydrogen , and @xmath9 is the concentration of a given ion ( the fraction of element @xmath10  with charge @xmath11 ) .",
    "because the abundance is dominated by oxygen , @xmath12  ranges from zero to about nine .",
    "our method generalizes from a cooling curve , @xmath1 , to a cooling plane @xmath13 .",
    "it consequently requires another function that allows us to update the ionization level , @xmath14 . with the mean charge as our ionization level indicator",
    ", @xmath15  is the difference between the mean ionization and recombination functions .",
    "thus @xmath16 , where @xmath17  and @xmath18 , and where @xmath19  and @xmath20  are the ionization and recombination rate coefficients , respectively , at @xmath21  for stage @xmath11  of element @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding cooling coefficient is @xmath22 , where @xmath23  is the cooling coefficient per ion @xmath24 .    to implement this approximation we search for a reasonable description of the nonequilibrium ionization concentrations , @xmath25 , representative of those found at @xmath21  and @xmath12",
    "this assumes that under actual nonequilibrium conditions , the distribution over ion states will depend less on the details of the past history than on how far the present mean charge differs from the collisional equilibrium value at the current temperature . in this paper",
    ", we consider the ionization distributions that arise in isothermal relaxation to equilibrium for each temperature @xmath6 , starting with nearly fully ionized or fully neutral gas .",
    "the atomic data used to develop the manifolds comes from raymond & smith ( 1977 ) , with updates described in raymond & cox ( 1985 ) , corrections in oscillator strengths in the cooling transitions of li - like ions ( shull & slavin 1994 ) , and revised dielectronic recombination rates of romanik ( 1988 ) .",
    "the abundances are taken from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "the effects of charge exchange are not included ; errors introduced by neglecting this are smaller than the uncertainties in the atomic data and elemental abundances used to generate the cooling curve .    [ secintro ]",
    "we have performed the manifold of non - equilibrium isothermal evolutions described below to form the basis for our approximation , producing tables of the cooling coefficient of trace elements @xmath13 and our ionization evolution functions @xmath26  and @xmath27 .",
    "gas is initialized with equilibrium ionization appropriate to some initial temperature @xmath28 .",
    "its temperature is then suddenly changed to @xmath6 and held fixed as the ionization evolves to equilibrium . by choosing @xmath28 to be low ( e.g. , @xmath29 k ) , and performing the calculation for a dense set of temperatures @xmath6 between @xmath29 and @xmath30 k , the runs sample the full range of conditions possible in under - ionized gases . by repeating the whole set once again with very high @xmath28 ( e.g. @xmath30 k )",
    ", conditions representing over - ionized gases are explored .",
    "together these cases sample the full range of @xmath12 .    a particular moment in an evolution",
    "can be characterized by @xmath28 , @xmath6 , and the fluence ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the ionization state is known , allowing straightforward evaluation of the mean charge @xmath12 and then using   as the index of the time evolution .",

    "the function @xmath35 passes through zero along this line . above the equlibrium curve ,",
    "the gas is recombining and d ( , ) is negative ; below , it is ionizing and d ( , ) is positive .",
    "these functions were calculated for a grid of isothermal evolutions .",
    "gas was either started with ionization fractions corresponding to @xmath38 k or @xmath39 k. it then ionized up or recombined down to @xmath40 at fixed temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the resultant rate coefficients were calculated versus @xmath12  for each @xmath6 for the range @xmath41k . ]",
    "the cooling function shown in figure 1 shows a huge peak at @xmath42 k and @xmath43 due to collisional excitation of low stages of ionization .",
    "it falls rapidly to the left due to boltzmann factors , and gradually to the right due to decreasing excitation cross - sections .",
    "it falls at higher   as fewer bound electrons with low enough energy are available for collisional excitation . above the equilibrium line",
    "the gas is over - ionized and collisional excitation is difficult , particularly at lower temperatures . at a given @xmath12 ,",
    "the mean ionization function , i , behaves much like the collisionally excited cooling , with vagaries at the transition from @xmath44 to 2 , and at @xmath45 where the mean ionization rate is sensitive to the relative proportions of helium- and lithium - like oxygen .",
    "the structure of the mean recombination rate , r , is more gradual . in the upper left corner",
    "it is dominated by radiative recombination and the gradual increase with @xmath12  and decrease with temperature are as expected .",
    "deviations from that smooth pattern in the rest of the diagram are due to dielectronic recombination . in both i and r , there are distortions in the patterns just above the equilibrium line .",
    "these arise because , in relaxing to equilibrium , a recombining plasma goes through a considerable compaction of its ionization distribution .",
    "the principal feature of the rate function   is that ionization toward equilibrium from below is much faster than recombination toward it from above . with increasing distance from equilibrium , the ionization rate increases dramatically , the recombination rate only gradually .",
    "to test the accuracy of our approximation for a wide range of situations , a representative set of cases were examined in which single parcels of gas in collisional equilibrium at @xmath46  k were suddenly shock heated and then subjected to varying degrees of expansion .",
    "the test situation was modeled on the sedov blast wave solution for an explosion of energy @xmath47 ergs into a homogeneous medium of particle density @xmath48 . by varying the preshock density and the assumed distance of the parcel from the explosion site",
    ", we adjusted the post shock temperature and the timescales for depressurization versus radiative cooling .",
    "these scenarios test the two behaviors in which drastic departures from equilibrium occur : the rapid ionization of gas passing through a shock front and the rapid adiabatic cooling of an over - ionized plasma .",
    "each parcel s evolution can be fully characterized by @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we have approximated @xmath50 , with @xmath51 being the time the parcel is shocked , and @xmath52 determining the rate of decompression .",
    "the temperature evolution is then    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the particle density of hydrogen ( ionized and neutral ) .",
    "we have carried out each simulation twice , first , solving the full ionization balance evolution exactly , then using our cooling approximation . in the latter ,",
    "we solve the ionization evolution for hydrogen , helium , and   ( four rate equations ) .",
    "the cooling is the sum of that from hydrogen , helium , and our tabulated cooling function .    in order to test the widest possible range of conditions , we chose three values of @xmath49 , with three different values of @xmath48 for each .",
    "the values of density were spaced to alter the initial ratio of depressurization to radiative cooling from approximately 0.4 at the high density end , to 6 and then 4000 at the lower densities . for the densest runs ,",
    "the structure is very similar to that of a steady state radiative shock . for the next lower density cases ,",
    "depressurization has strong effects but cooling is still sufficiently rapid that the density eventually rises rather than falling with time . at the lowest densities , the density and temperature fall adiabatically and the ionization level is soon frozen in .",

    "the time evolution for each curve is from right to left .",
    "the cooling curve for collisional ionization equilibrium is also shown ( dotted ) .",
    "the middle set of panels shows the ratio of the approximation for trace element cooling to the exact value for each of the above cases . for `` mixed '' and `` radiative '' evolution ,",
    "the highest temperature cases are sufficiently similar that the curves overlie each other .",
    "the lowest set of panels show the ionization evolution for these cases in the t-   plane .",
    "the solid curves show the exact evolution for the nine cases above , while the dashed lines show the slight departures that result by using the approximation we present .",
    "the dotted line in each panel shows the mean charge in collisional equilibrium as a function of gas temperature , @xmath37 , as in figure 1 . ]",
    "figure 2 shows the exact trace element cooling coefficient evolutions versus temperature , the ratio of our approximate results to the exact ones , and the evolutions of mean charge , both exact and approximate . in each case",
    ", the cooling function begins very high just after the shock , when the gas is still briefly nearly neutral . at the two higher temperatures in the middle and right hand panels , the gas rapidly ionizes up and",
    "the cooling function drops precipitously to very close to the equilibrium value .",
    "this  ion flash \" is so rapid that the integrated cooling during this period is negligible , as evidenced by the nearly vertical tracks .",
    "thereafter , these tracks follow the equilibrium curve down to just below @xmath63k , after which their recombination can not keep up with the cooling and the cooling rate falls below the equilibrium value . in the lowest temperature cases ,",
    "significant cooling takes place before the cooling function drops through equilibrium , after which it plunges toward the nonequilibrium curve of the initially higher temperature cases .",
    "the differences between the radiation dominated and mixed evolutions are almost negligible . in the expansion dominated cases , however , things are quite different .",
    "the temperature drops so rapidly that the gas is soon over - ionized ; recombination is slower than the temperature drop , and the ionization level declines only gradually or is frozen in .",
    "the middle row of panels shows the ratio of approximate to exact cooling coefficients . in the two right hand panels , the approximation is good to within about 10% except below @xmath64k where it is consistently high by about 40% , and in a peak at @xmath65k where it can be as much as 20 to 30% high . at this temperature ,",
    "the approximate @xmath12  evolutions of the two higher temperature cases in the two right lower panels of figure 2 diverge by @xmath66 charge states from the exact results .",
    "this is due in part to the excess cooling , but the recombination rate is almost certainly slightly too low as well .    for the rapidly depressurizing cases , radiative cooling is inconsequential .",
    "nevertheless , the cooling coefficient which differs substantially from the other cases , is still reasonably well fit , except for the intermediate temperature case for which @xmath12  gets frozen at a value of 5.5 . in that case , the value of @xmath12  is well represented by the approximation , but the approximate cooling coefficient is too high .",
    "the freezing in of the ionization is extremely well matched , except very late in the highest initial temperature case .",
    "we have also compared the time evolution of density , temperature , mean charge , and the cooling coefficients for the exact calculation , our approximation , and the case where the trace elements are assumed to be in collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "while the time evolution of temperature and density of the exact calculations and our approximation are in reasonably good agreement , the case with collisional ionization equilibrium shows significant differences in the time evolution of temperature . in addition",
    ", the ionization equilibrium assumption provides a poor estimate of the true ionization level of the gas , especially for the expansion dominated cases .",
    "we provide a means by which large hydrocodes can include an accurate approximation to the radiative cooling coefficient , one far more responsive to the vagaries of dynamical environments than any single function of temperature .",
    "the method also follows the mean ionization level of the gas .",
    "both the trace element cooling coefficient @xmath13 , and the rate of change of @xmath12  depend only on the identification of a manifold of representative ionization concentrations found at a particular temperature and mean charge .",
    "the ionization concentrations we used came from the isothermal relaxations of both highly over - ionized and highly under - ionized gas . in the test cases presented ,",
    "both the cooling coefficient and mean charge evolution are quite accurately approximated .",
    "for all cases in which radiative cooling is significant , the approximation never errs by more than 30% .",
    "the error is usually less than 10 to 15% , well within the accuracy of the true cooling coefficient , which is limited by uncertainties in atomic data and abundances .",
    "the error in the cooling coefficient can be somewhat larger in examples with extreme amounts of depressurization , but never by enough to make the negligible radiative cooling appear to be significant .",
    "our approximate cooling coefficients and charge evolution rates , however , showed patterns in their modest errors , patterns which we believe we understand and can eliminate with future work .",
    "should a potential user wait for these improvements before beginning to implement this method ?",
    "the current model provides an excellent approximation for the cooling coefficient . if one is interested only in dynamics , it is certainly sufficient .",
    "implementation of the next generation requires only swapping one set of tables for another .",
    "our future work will also examine the possibility that the ion distributions can be used to provide absorption and emission spectra in post processing .",
    "it is possible to do this at the two parameter level , but higher order corrections will also be examined .",
    "the latter are expected to be two to four times more complex , and will be pursued only if spectral accuracy requires it .",
    "an additional consideration for gas with @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the effect of photoionization on the ionization balance and therefore the cooling .",
    "our scheme can be easily modified to incorporate photoionization of hydrogen and helium .",
    "however , the effects of photoionization of trace elements would require a table of photoionization correction factors for @xmath69 and @xmath15 .",
    "this too will be considered in future refinements .",
    "we would like to thank john raymond for compiling and providing much of the atomic data that went into this work , and for a very careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "we would also like to thank nasa astrophysical theory grant nag5 - 8417 for financial support of this work . and",
    "finally , we would like to acknowledge the valuable contributions of leo krzewina , angela klohs , andrew pawl , and tim freyer who all expended some effort on cracking this problem ."
