    "it has been discussed that a study of a negatively charged @xmath0 hyperon in nuclei would provide valuable information concerning the maximal mass of neutron stars @xcite , in which a baryon fraction is found to depend on properties of hypernuclear potentials in neutron stars .",
    "the @xmath0 hyperon in nuclei undergoes a fast decay via strong @xmath10 conversion processes due to the mass difference of @xmath11 mev .",
    "gal and dover @xcite estimated a broad @xmath0 width of @xmath12 mev in nuclear matter by effectively describing the conversion processes as the imaginary part of a @xmath3-nucleus ( optical ) potential .",
    "one of the most important subjects in this research field is to clarify properties of the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath3-nucleus potential .",
    "the latest analyses of strong - interaction shifts and widths in @xmath0 atoms , which are obtained from the @xmath0 atomic x - ray data , have suggested that the @xmath3-nucleus potential has a repulsion inside the nucleus and a shallow attraction outside the nuclear surface @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noticed that the @xmath0 atomic energies and widths are not so sensitive to a radial distribution of the @xmath3-nucleus potential inside the nucleus .",
    "noumi and his collaborators @xcite have performed measurements of @xmath3-hypernuclear production by inclusive ( @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 ) reactions on c , si , ni , in and bi targets at @xmath13 1.20 gev / c in kek - e438 experiments .",
    "several theoretical analyses have also suggested that a repulsive component in the @xmath3-nucleus potentials is needed to reproduce the observed spectra of ( @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 ) reactions on nuclear targets @xcite .",
    "this repulsion originates from the @xmath14 @xmath15 , @xmath16 channel , of which state corresponds to a quark pauli - forbidden state in the baryon - baryon system @xcite , and it is a candidate for the appearance of quark degrees of freedom in nuclear physics .    in a previous paper @xcite , we have succeeded to explain the @xmath6si(@xmath4 ,  @xmath5 ) data as well as the @xmath0 atomic x - ray data simultaneously , by using the @xmath3-nucleus potentials that have a repulsion inside the nuclear surface and an attraction outside the nucleus with a sizable absorption @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the radial distribution of the potential inside the nucleus and its strength at the center are hardly determined by fits to the @xmath0 qf spectrum @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0 continuum states in the qf region are favored in the ( @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 ) reaction due to its large momentum transfer of @xmath17 mev / c , quantitative ambiguity of the potential can not be resolved in the analysis of the complicated continuum states over a wide excitation - energy range @xcite .",
    "one expects that there are the @xmath0-nucleus bound states assisted by the coulomb attraction even if the @xmath3-nucleus potential is repulsive .",
    "the wave functions of the @xmath0 states are sizably moderated by strong interactions because a rms radius for a @xmath0 atomic @xmath18 state in medium - to - heavy nuclei is comparable to its nuclear size , e.g. , @xmath19 4.2 fm for a @xmath20co core - nucleus where @xmath21 4.23 fm .",

    "<S> we theoretically demonstrate the inclusive ( @xmath1 ,  @xmath2 ) spectra of the @xmath0 unstable bound states on @xmath6si , @xmath7ni , and @xmath8pb targets at incident @xmath1 lab momenta @xmath9 mev / c . </S>",
