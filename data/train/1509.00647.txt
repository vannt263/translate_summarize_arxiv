    "in this section , we derive the magnetostrictive stress vector @xmath25 .",
    "we start with the magnetostrictive deformation of a polycristalline free - standing ferromagnetic ( fm ) film with cylindrical shape and transform the corresponding strain tensor to the @xmath88-coordinate system ( where the @xmath9-axis is parallel to the nanobeam ) .",

    "the magnetization is along the @xmath90-axis , while the nanobeam is parallel to the @xmath9-axis . aligning the magnetization in a free - standing magnetostrictive thin film ( for illustration purposes we have chosen a cylindrically shaped film here ) causes a strain @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) along the @xmath90 ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) axis . ]",
    "first , we consider a free - standing fm thin film , which is centered around the origin of the @xmath88-coordinate system ( the lab system ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : coordinatesystemandmagnetostrictionsm ] ( dashed circle ) .",
    "when magnetizing the fm , the film is contracted ( elongated ) along ( perpendicular to ) the magnetization direction .",
    "the relative contraction / elongation @xmath93 is given by@xcite @xmath94    we define a second coordinate system @xmath95 , which is rotated relative to the @xmath88-system by an angle of @xmath12 around the @xmath96-axis . here , @xmath12 is the angle between the nanobeam axis and the magnetization direction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coordinatesystemandmagnetostrictionsm ] .",
    "the @xmath95-coordinate system represents the natural system for the magnetostriction . in this frame of reference ,",
    "the magnetization @xmath97 is along the @xmath90-axis and the magnetostrictive strain tensor is given by @xmath98    using the rotation tensor @xmath99 , which maps the @xmath88-coordinate system to the @xmath95-coordinate system , @xmath100 we get the components of the strain tensor in the @xmath88-coordinate system of the nanobeam : @xmath101    in case of a thin fm film on a substrate ( or on top of a si@xmath2n@xmath3 nanobeam , as in our case ) , the geometric dimensions of the fm are fixed in @xmath9- and @xmath10-direction , which means the effective strain along these axes vanishes .",
    "we describe this with an additional strain @xmath102 so that the net strain @xmath103 vanishes along the @xmath9- and @xmath10-direction : @xmath104 in a more intuitive picture , magnetostriction changes the equilibrium dimensions of the film . along the magnetization direction , e.g. , the equilibrium length of the film is reduced ( @xmath105 ) . however , the boundary conditions require an unchanged length , which results in a tensile stress in the fm film along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "analogously , magnetostriction creates a compressive stress in the fm along the @xmath10-direction .",
    "perpendicular to the film plane , the fm is free to expand .",
    "thus , the strain applied by the boundary conditions creates the stress @xmath106 with the elasticity tensor @xmath22 ( see ref .  ) .    in voigt notation ( see e.g.  ref .  ) , @xmath102 is written as @xmath107 and the elasticity tensor @xmath22 is given by @xmath108 with the shear modulus @xmath24 , the lam constant @xmath109 and young s modulus @xmath23 ( see refs .  ) .",
    "as the fm film can expand freely in @xmath96-direction , the stress component @xmath110 has to vanish .",

    "as mentioned in the main text , the measured @xmath11-dependence of the nanobeam resonance frequency shows slight deviations from the expected @xmath59 behaviour . to study this in more detail , we repeat the measurements discussed in the main article for lower magnetic fields . whereas for @xmath48 the magnetization @xmath97 is roughly aligned along @xmath116 ,",

    "<S> , we calculate the magnetostriction constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 in polycrystalline magnetically saturated cobalt from the crystal magnetostriction constants @xmath75 as described in ref .  , for which we obtain @xmath76 and @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in very good agreement with the experimentally determined values . </S>",
    "<S> thus we conclude that the proposed method conforms with standard magnetostriction measurement techniques , which e.g.  use the bending of a cantilever covered with a thin magnetostrictive film@xcite , and is therefore suitable to quantitatively determine the magnetostriction constants of thin films . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to cantilever - based experiments , where magnetostriction causes a bending of the mechanical element , the present approach uses a pre - stressed , doubly - clamped nanobeam where the magnetostrictive stress modifies the total stress along the beam axis and therefore changes the resonance frequency of the beam . </S>",
    "<S> this stress - to - frequency conversion allows for an effective determination of the magnetostriction constants via a frequency measurement , which does not rely on a quantitative measurement of the beam displacement ( as it is the case for cantilever - based techniques ) . </S>",
    "<S> the high quality factor of pre - stressed si@xmath2n@xmath3 nanobeam resonators@xcite therefore allows to precisely investigate magnetostriction in thin films .    </S>",
    "<S> although the presented method only allows to experimentally access one stress direction ( i.e.  the stress component along the beam direction ) , it can be particularly useful for the investigation of very thin ( or nanopatterned ) magnetostrictive films with a high precision . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that , as we will show in the following , the experimental uncertainty of the calculated magnetostriction constants does not necessarily increase for decreasing film thickness as it is the case for cantilever - based measurement techniques .    to illustrate this </S>",
    "<S> , we first calculate the stress - frequency gauge factor , i.e.  the change of the resonance frequency of the beam as a function of the stress variation . for the presented sample this is @xmath78    </S>",
    "<S> assuming a frequency measurement precision of @xmath79 ( with the linewidth of the resonance @xmath80 ) , this allows to resolve a stress variation of @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to an experimental uncertainty in the parallel magnetostriction constant of @xmath82 . using a phase - locked loop ( ppl ) to track the resonance frequency of the beam , however , would increase the frequency resolution significantly , allowing an uncertainty @xmath83 well below @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> this is comparable to other methods@xcite even though the thickness of our magnetostrictive film is only 10 nm . in particular , reducing the film thickness further does not necessarily reduce the measurement precision . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the quality factor of a doubly - clamped si@xmath2n@xmath3 beam covered with a thin film typically strongly depends on the film thickness . for si@xmath2n@xmath3/au nanobeams , </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown recently that the inverse quality factor is proportional to the film thickness for au layers between 10 nm and 100 nm as the damping in a highly prestressed silicon nitride film is much lower than in the au film@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for very thin magnetostrictive films on a highly prestressed si@xmath2n@xmath3 beam , the resonance frequency measurement uncertainty is proportional to the film thickness , @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty @xmath86 is therefore in first approximation independent of the film thickness ( assuming @xmath87 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this characteristic makes the proposed technique an ideal platform for the investigation of magnetostriction in thin and ultrathin films .    in this letter , we have proposed a new method to quantitatively investigate magnetostriction in thin films . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we use a si@xmath2n@xmath3 nanomechanical resonator covered with a thin magnetostrictive film . by measuring the resonance frequency of the fundamental vibrational mode of the beam as a function of an external magnetic field we can deduce the magnetostrictive stress along the beam direction and hence the magnetostriction constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 . compared to </S>",
    "<S> previously reported methods , the proposed technique does not rely on a quantitative measurement of the mechanical displacement , but utilizes a resonance frequency shift caused by magnetostriction . </S>",
    "<S> besides , it offers a measurement precision which is independent of the film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> this enables the investigation of ultrathin magnetostrictive films and paves the way to study magnetostriction as a function of the film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed technique can be applied to any conducting or insulating material which can be deposited on a si@xmath2n@xmath3 nanobeam via electron beam evaporation , thermal evaporation , sputtering etc . </S>",
    "<S> the material under investigation does not have to be etch - resistent as it is deposited on the nano - resonator as last step of the sample fabrication process .    </S>",
