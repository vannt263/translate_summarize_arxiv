    "photon frequency conversion  @xcite refers to transducing the input photons with a given frequency into the output photons with a different frequency while preserving the non - classical quantum properties .",
    "experimentally , the photon frequency conversion has been achieved in the nonlinear medium by frequency mixing technologies  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "especially , the single - photon frequency conversion  @xcite has many applications in quantum information and quantum communication process , and the effective single - photon frequency conversion scheme  @xcite has been proposed in a waveguide channel with the assistance of the sagnac interferometer which couples to a multi - level emitter  @xcite .",
    "recently , the coherent control of the single photon has been studied in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) waveguide with linear  @xcite and nonlinear  @xcite dispersion relations , where the two - level or three - level system acts as a quantum switch . when the three - level system is applied as a scatter  @xcite",
    ", the photons can be transferred from one channel to another , and the carried frequency in different channels can be same or different , depending on whether the atom experiences the internal state transition in the scattering process or not . in present study , we aim to study a single - photon frequency converter mechanism in a single channel which is realized with waveguide .    to this end",
    ", we propose a scheme via a single waveguide with a located @xmath0-type atom , where the photon in the waveguide couples to one arm transition , and is scattered by the atom . to convert the frequency of the incident photon",
    ", we drive the other arm transition of the atom via a classical field .",
    "the subsystem consisting of the classical driving and the related two levels coupling to it , forms a pair of non - generated dressed ground states , which supports two channels ( but still in the same waveguide ) for the incident photons .",
    "the energy conservation implies that the frequency of the incident photons will be converted when it is transferred from one channel to the other .",
    "we would remark that the @xmath0-type three - level system has been also used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the carried frequencies of photons in two channels are the same because only a single atom ground state is involved .",
    "compared to the previous schemes  @xcite , our scheme has the following two advantages : ( i ) we would apply only one single waveguide , which can be realized more easily with the current experimental technologies .",
    "( ii ) the frequency difference between the two channels can be controlled only by adjusting the frequency and strength of the driving field , instead of the atomic energy level configuration .    in this paper",
    ", we firstly give a general description for the single - photon transmission and frequency conversion mechanism in one dimensional waveguide based on lippman - schwinger equation  @xcite .",
    "then we consider two explicit models : the coupled resonator waveguide ( crw )  @xcite and one - dimensional optical waveguide  @xcite .",
    "for the case of crw , the single - excitation spectrum of each of the two channels has the structure of one energy band and two discrete bound states with one of them being above the energy band and the other below it . on the contrary ,",
    "the related spectrum structures of the two channels in the case of optical waveguide have only the lower energy bounds but no upper ones and bound states . in both of these models ,",
    "the frequency converter only works when the incident photon frequency is inside the overlap regime of the spectra of the two channels .",
    "we find that the classical driving field prefers to be weak in the crw but arbitrarily strong in optical waveguide to achieve an optimal transfer efficiency .",
