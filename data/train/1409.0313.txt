    "recently a common generalization of the fourier , maxwell - cattaneo - vernotte , guyer - krumhansl , jeffreys - type and green - naghdi heat conduction equations was derived in the framework of non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "then experimental and theoretical studies were performed in order to understand the role of different terms and also the possibility of detecting non - fourier effects @xcite . according to the basic hypothesis of these investigations , material heterogneities",
    "are manifested in additional higher order space and time derivatives in the material functions and result in nonlocal and memory effects ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , these effects may be not apparent , the observed phenomena may be fourier like due to the universal dissipative nature of the additional terms .",
    "therefore it is important to identify and analyse possible qualitative signatures for experimental observation .",
    "the non - equilibrium thermodynamical theory of generalized heat conduction of @xcite is based on the assumption of a minimal deviation from local equilibrium .",
    "the deviation is expressed in terms of new fields and may appear both in the density and in the current density of the entropy :    * in the entropy a quadratic expression of a vectorial internal variable represents the deviation from local equilibrium in the continua @xcite .",
    "this contribution results in memory effects . * a generalization of the entropy current density , with the help of current multipliers , represents the deviation of the currents from their local equilibrium form @xcite .",
    "this contribution results in nonlocal effects .",
    "the modifications are restricted only by the second law of thermodynamics , do not incorporate assumptions about the structure of the continua , therefore in this sense the approach is universal @xcite .",
    "an important problematic point of the theory is , that the structure of the derived system of evolution equations seems to be incompatible with the existing theories of extended thermodynamics , that is with the hyperbolic system of the momentum series expansion hierarchy of the kinetic theory @xcite . in particular",
    "it does not compatible with the ballistic phonons , a well explained non - fourier propagation mechanism in low temperature materials @xcite .    in this paper we slightly modify and extend the approach of @xcite introducing the heat flux as a basic field , instead of the general vectorial internal variable of @xcite .",
    "we also introduce an additional second order tensorial internal variable and the corresponding generalization of the entropy flux by current multipliers . this way we reproduce the first two levels of the hierarchy of kinetic theory in a generalized , phenomenological framework , without any particular assumptions on the structure of the material ( e.g. a rarefied gas ) .",
    "we assume only a second law compatible deviation from local equilibrium .",
    "what we obtain is more general than the corresponding set of equations of extended thermodynamics , that is the equations obtained from or motivated by the hierarchy of moments in kinetic theory . due to the phenomenological assumptions the whole structure is flexible and we can derive several known generalizations of the fourier equation in a uniform framework obtaining information regarding their applicability and interrelations . in this respect it is remarkable that green - naghdi equations @xcite are obtained as well as cahn - hilliard type heat conduction @xcite .",
    "these heat conduction models were justified by rigorous mathematical methods but not related to extended thermodynamics .",
    "an other important property of our approach is that old paradoxes and reservations regarding some forms of heat conduction are shown in a new light .",
    "for example the well discussed paradox of heat waves with negative values of temperature of the maxwell - cattaneo - vernotte and the jeffreys - type equations ( see e.g. in @xcite ) seems to be removed simply because thermodynamics requires the gradient of the reciprocal temperature instead of the gradient of the temperature in the related terms of the equations .",
    "this paper focuses on the problem of observability of non - fouirer heat conduction from a theoretical point of view . solving generalized heat conduction models with heat pulse initial and boundary conditions",
    "will demonstrate that fourier type solutions may appear unexpectedly and therefore in addition of wavelike effects one may look for other observable benchmarks of heat conduction beyond fourier .    in the next section we introduce the theory and derive the heat conduction equation up to the second current multiplier and",
    "show some known particular cases . in the third section",
    "we introduce a simple finite difference numerical method to solve the set of equations .",
    "finally we show some demonstrative solutions of the equations on the example of laser flash experiment in order to identify possible non - fourier effects .",
    "in this paper we restrict ourselves to rigid heat conductors , therefore the time derivatives are partial and the density of the material is constant .",
    "our starting point is the balance of internal energy : @xmath0    here @xmath1 is the density of the internal energy , and @xmath2 is the heat flux , the current density of the internal energy .",
    "@xmath3 denotes the partial time derivative and @xmath4 with the central dot is the divergence , @xmath5 .",
    "the second law is given in the following form @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the entropy density and @xmath8 is the entropy current density vector . for modeling phenomena beyond local equilibrium , we introduce the heat flux @xmath2 as basic field variable and also a second order tensorial internal variable denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the advantage of using the heat flux as basic field quantity instead of a vectorial internal variable of the treatment in @xcite is the easier comparison with extended thermodynamics .",
    "the deviation from local equilibrium will be characterized by two basic constitutive hypotheses :    * we assume a quadratic dependence of the entropy density on the additional fields @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are positive constant material coefficients .",
    "this is not a complete isotropic representation , for the sake of simplicity we have introduced a single material coefficient for the second order tensor @xmath13 , too .",
    "the derivative of the local equilibrium part of the entropy function @xmath14 by the internal energy is the reciprocal temperature : @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the quadratic form may be considered as a first approximation in case of the heat flux and is due to the morse lemma for the internal variable @xcite .",
    "the sign is determined requiring concave entropy function , that is , thermodynamic stability @xcite .",
    "* we assume that the entropy flux is zero if @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "therefore it can be written in the following form : @xmath19 here @xmath20 is a second order tensorial constitutive function and @xmath21 is a third order one .",
    "they are the current multipliers introduced by nyri @xcite .",
    "general aspects of this assumption were treated in @xcite and the special case of heat conduction was considered in @xcite .",
    "now the basic fields are @xmath22 and @xmath13 , the constitutive functions are @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the entropy production is : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the unit tensor and the triple dot denotes the full contraction of third order tensors . in the last row",
    "the first and the third terms are products of second order tensors , the second term is the product of vectors and the last term is of third order ones .",
    "the time derivatives of the state variables @xmath25 and @xmath13 represent their evolution equations , here they are constitutive quantities . therefore one can identify four thermodynamic forces and currents in the above expression and assume linear relationship between them in order to obtain the solution of the entropy inequality .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + .21 cm table 1 .",
    "thermodynamic fluxes and forces    the third and fourth force - current pairs are related to the tensorial internal variable @xmath13 . in case of isotropic materials only the second order tensors",
    "can show cross effects ( extended thermal and internal interactions ) , the vectorial ( thermal ) and third order tensorial terms ( extended internal ) are independent .    in the following we will simplify the treatment and develop the theory in one spatial direction . in the one dimensional representation of the tensors we remove the boldface letters , and the one dimensional spatial derivative",
    "is denoted by @xmath26 .    in this case the entropy production can be rewritten as : @xmath27    the linear relations between the thermodynamic fluxes and forces result in the following constitutive equations : @xmath28    the entropy inequality requires the following inequalities @xmath29    the above set of constitutive equations - together with the energy balance and the caloric equation of state @xmath30 give a solvable set of equations , with suitable boundary and initial conditions . in case of constant coefficients one",
    "can easily eliminate the current multipliers by substituting them from - into - and obtain : @xmath31    here @xmath32 denotes the @xmath33-th partial derivative by @xmath34 .",
    "this set of equations is similar to the 13 field equations of kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "we can eliminate the internal variable @xmath35 , too , and obtain the following general constitutive equation for the heat flux @xmath36 : @xmath37 in this equation the coefficients are nonnegative according to the second law .",
    "one can distinguish between the following special cases :    [ [ section ] ]    @xmath38 .",
    "then the second current multiplier @xmath39 is eliminated and therefore the highest order spatial derivatives of @xmath36 and @xmath40 are missing .",
    "@xmath41      @xmath42",
    ". then we obtain @xmath43 we will see , that this equation may show ballistic propagation . in this case either @xmath44 or @xmath45 is not positive because of .      @xmath46 . in this case",
    "both the tensorial internal variable and the corresponding current multiplier is eliminated : @xmath47      @xmath48 .",
    "then one obtains the generalized heat conduction law of @xcite : @xmath49      @xmath50 .",
    "then one obtains fourier equation extended by the second spatial derivative of the heat flux : @xmath51 this equation is a cahn - hilliard type one , similar to the hypertemperature model of forest and amestoy except a sign @xcite .",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath44 or @xmath53 .",
    "then one obtains the jeffreys type like heat conduction law : @xmath54 strictly speaking it is different of the jeffreys type equation , because of the reciprocal temperature instead of the temperature on the right hand side .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath44 or @xmath53",
    ". then we get the maxwell - cattaneo - vernotte equation : @xmath56      @xmath57 and @xmath44 or @xmath53 . then eliminating almost everything",
    "one obtains the thermodynamic form of the fourier law : @xmath58    here @xmath59 is the fourier heat conduction coefficient .",
    "heat pulse experiments were important in the discovery of second sound and ballistic propagation phenomena ( see e.g. @xcite ) and in the framework of laser flash method it is an important part of standard engineering practice @xcite . in this section",
    "we analyze some consequences of the previous general equations in case of heat pulses in order to identify possible qualitative effects .",
    "the system of equations to be solved are the energy balance and the constitutive evolution equations for the heat flux and the internal variable - with the initial and boundary conditions specific for the heat pulse experiment .",
    "we substitute the caloric equation of state @xmath60 , into the energy balance , where @xmath61 is the density and @xmath62 is the specific heat . in this numerical study",
    "we restrict ourselves to the ballistic - conductive model , where @xmath38 and @xmath63 . introducing a convenient notation for the constitutive equations results in : @xmath64    here @xmath65 and @xmath66 are relaxation times , @xmath67 is the fourier heat conduction coefficent and @xmath68 , @xmath69 are material parameters .",
    "the front side boundary condition is a heat pulse of the following form :    @xmath70    at the backside of the sample , @xmath71 , we consider adiabatic insulation , therefore @xmath72 .",
    "initially the fields are homogeneous and the initial conditions are @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    after these operations we introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath75 for the time , space , temperature , heat flux and internal variable , respectively .",
    "@xmath76    the dimensionless parameters are @xmath77 here @xmath78 and the coefficient in @xmath79 is positive due to the entropy inequality . finally we get the ballistic - conductive equations in a non - dimensional form @xmath80 if @xmath81 , then the guyer - krumhansl system is obtained .",
    "the corresponding initial conditions are @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the boundary conditions are given for the heat flux only .",
    "at the rear side @xmath84 and the heat pulse at the front side is    @xmath85    the above set of initial and boundary conditions will be sufficient for the numerical solution of the problem .",
    "in this and also in the following sections the previously introduced dimensionless variables and parameters will be used without hat .",
    "now we analyze a finite difference method of solution of the above mathematical problem .",
    "we apply a finite difference scheme which is forward in time and one - sided in space .",
    "in fact , it uses the values like a centered scheme in space which holds only for shifted fields .",
    "there are two kind of discretized fields , one of them is covering the space interval from @xmath86 , while the others are shifted by @xmath87 ( see figure [ fig : disc ] ) .",
    "the essential aspect of this method is that we can neglect the boundary conditions of shifted fields , because the points of these fields correspond to the middle point of each cell . in the particular case of the laser flash experiment",
    "it is straightforward to use only the heat flux boundary condition .",
    "it is noted that the fields can be interchanged , the shifting is not necessary and it can be mixed , e.g. if one want to define conditions both for temperature and heat flux , then only the current density of heat flux should be shifted .",
    "the discrete form of the balance of internal energy reads as : @xmath88 the discrete constitutive equations are : @xmath89 here @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the time and the space indeces .",
    "the scheme is explicit therefore the stability is an essential side of the analysis .",
    "we have applied the von neumann method , i.e. we assumed the solution of the difference equation in the form @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the growth factor with stability condition @xmath94 , @xmath33 is the imaginary unit , @xmath95 is the wave number .",
    "after substitution we get the system of linear algebraic equations : @xmath96 where @xmath97    the characteristic equation of the system can be calculated from @xmath980 and jury criteria is applied for stability analysis .      if the characteristic equation is given in the form @xmath99 where @xmath100 , then the related conditions of stability are @xcite    1 .",

    "the conditions are checked during the calculations .",
    "we did not encounter remarkable stability problems with this discretization .",
    "in this section we classify the solutions of the guyer - krumhansl equation as fourier - like , mcv - like ( under - diffusive ) and gk - like ( over - diffusive ) .",
