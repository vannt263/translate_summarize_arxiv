    "the _ chandra _ satellite ( ) observed ms  1603.6 + 2600 with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on march 11 , 2002 for nearly 7 ksec starting at 08:19 ( tt ; mjd 52344.346 ) .",

    "the spectra are extracted with 20 counts per bin .",

    "we plot the lightcurve in the 0.310 kev energy band .",

    "the lightcurve shows a sinusoidal modulation with a period consistent with that derived previously from optical photometric and x  ray observations (; ) .",
    "similar to the 1991 _ rosat pspc _ observations ( ) , no partial x ",
    "ray eclipse is present during our 2002 _ chandra _ observation .",
    "however , eclipses have been observed during a 1997 _ asca _ observation . found a clear dependence of the lightcurve profile on the photon energy .",
    "they observed an eclipse at x ",
    "rays ( @xmath232 kev ) whereas at energies @xmath242 kev the eclipse is much less pronounced ; we find no evidence for a change in the amplitude of the sinusoidal lightcurve profile as a function of energy .",
    "perhaps the fact that we do not find evidence for such behaviour ties in with the behaviour observed at optical wavelengths .",
    "if the overall source luminosity is higher , the eclipses in optical are less pronounced ; at the highest optical luminosities they disappear completely ( ) . indeed , the 0.110 kev unabsorbed flux at the epoch of the observations of ( @xmath058@xmath25 ) is a factor of 1.5 lower than the unabsorbed 0.110 kev flux we measured in our _ chandra _ observations ( 1.2@xmath15 erg@xmath16s@xmath17 ) .    as mentioned in the introduction it has been considered that ms  1603.6 + 2600 is a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) and not an lmxb",
    ". however , as discussed in and the optical and x  ray properties of ms  1603.6 + 2600 are difficult to reconcile with a cv scenario .",
    "so , if ms  1603.6 + 2600 is a cv it must be an unusual one ( ) . there are three possible lmxb scenarios for ms  1603.6 + 2600 presented in the literature ; below we will discuss all three of them .    interpreting the observed x ",
    "ray flare as a type  i x  ray burst , note that the source distance must be large ( @xmath075 kpc ) , consistent with earlier estimates ( 3080 kpc ; ) .",
    "they further argue that based on the variability of the lightcurve in optical and x  rays the source differs from an adc source like 2s  1822371 , and hence it is a dipper source like 4u  1916053 . however , variability in adc sources is not new .",
    "for instance , the soft x ",
    "ray transient 4u  2129 + 47 is an adc source in outburst while in quiescence full eclipses are observed (; ) .",
    "furthermore , if ms  1603.6 + 2600 is a dipper at 75 kpc the absolute visual magnitude , m@xmath26 , of the source would be @xmath00 , much larger than that of the high inclination source in a 50 minute orbit 4u  1916053 ( m@xmath27 ) and even larger than that of the eclipsing source in a 3.9 hour orbital period exo  0748676 ( m@xmath28 ; ) .",
    "the error on the estimates of these absolute magnitudes will be smaller than @xmath29 magnitude since the distance estimates for these systems were obtained using radius expansion bursts ( 4u  1916053 , ; exo  0748676 , ) .",
    "such estimates are typically accurate to approximately 20 per cent ( ) .",
    "furthermore , the reddening towards these sources is low and well established ( 4u  1916053 , ; exo  0748676 , ) . since the absolute optical magnitude scales with the binary orbital period and the x  ray luminosity ( ) , it is unlikely that the absolute optical magnitude of the 1.85 hour system ms  1603.6 + 2600 is larger than that of exo  0748676 . on the basis of this , we conclude that it is unlikely that ms  1603.6 + 2600 is a dipper at a distance as large as 75 kpc .",
    "the x  ray and optical properties of ms  1603.6 + 2600 are consistent with a dipper scenario in which the distance to the source is @xmath01520 kpc if either the observed x ",
    "ray flare was not a type  i x  ray burst or the luminosity of the burst was unusually low .",
    "favour a less distant ( d@xmath00.252.7 kpc ) source assuming ms  1603.6 + 2600 is a soft x ",
    "ray transient accreting at a low rate in quiescence . even though the x  ray spectrum of several neutron star soft x  ray transients in quiescence is well fit by a black body , often a power  law component is present in the spectrum as well .",
    "the quiescent x  ray spectrum of sax  j1808.43658 was well fit by a single power law ( ) similar to the x  ray spectrum of ms  1603.6 + 2600 albeit somewhat harder ( the power ",
    "law index for sax  j1808.43658 was 1.5 ) .",
    "the quiescent spectrum of black hole candidate sxts in quiescence is well fit by a power law with an index of @xmath02 ( ) .",
    "several systems containing a neutron star compact object accreting at a low rate have been identified ( ) . an outburst has never been observed from these systems . if ms  1603.6 + 2600 is indeed at a distance of approximately 1 kpc then the distance modulus is @xmath010 .",
    "given the observed v band magnitude of ms  1603.6 + 2600 ( r=19.4 , v@xmath019.7 ; ) m@xmath26 is @xmath010 .",
    "given the fact that many disc lines and even the bowen blend are observed in the spectrum ( ) the disc absolute magnitude must be close to this whereas that of the companion star must be less than 10 ; constraining the spectral type of the companion star to late type m dwarfs .",
    "such a star indeed fits the roche lobe assuming a neutron star mass of 1.4 m@xmath30 .",
    "the luminosity of ms  1603.6 + 2600 is close to 10@xmath31 erg s@xmath17 if the distance is 1 kpc .",
    "this luminosity is typical for a neutron star lmxb in quiescence . using the same line of reasoning",
    "one can show that a late type m star also nearly fits the roche lobe of a nearby black hole candidate ( with an assumed black hole mass of 6 m@xmath30 ) sxt in quiescence .",
    "however , strong he  ii and he  i lines are present in the spectrum of ms  1603.6 + 2600 .",
    "such he features are present in the spectra of actively accreting low  mass x  ray binaries ( ) but not in the spectrum of the quiescent soft x  ray transient cen  x4 (; ) . in this `` quiescent soft x  ray transient '' scenario the x  ray flare observed by can not have been a type  i x  ray burst for its luminosity was much too low for a distance of @xmath01 kpc . x ",
    "ray flaring in quiescence is not unfeasible since optical flares have been found in both neutron star and black hole soft x  ray transients in quiescence (; ) .    in adc sources only a fraction of the true source luminosity is observed due to scattering in the adc . in case of 4u  2129 + 47 a type i x  ray burst was observed for which the luminosity was a factor of @xmath0500 lower than the eddington luminosity ( ) . similarly , argue that the intrinsic source luminosity of adc sources should be @xmath32 ; this is higher than the luminosities one would derive for adc sources if one assumed that the sources are viewed directly .",
    "finally , presented evidence based on the observed spin  up of the pulsar in the adc source 2s  1822371 showing that the intrinsic source luminosity is a factor of @xmath0100 higher than the observed luminosity .",
    "if we assume that we only observe between 1/500 and 1/100 of the intrinsic source luminosity of ms  1603.6 + 2600 the distance would be @xmath01124 kpc assuming that the intrisic burst flux ( i.e. 100500 times the observed flux ) of the burst in ms  1603.6 + 2600 observed by _ asca",
    "_ corresponds to the eddington luminosity ( we take for the eddington luminosity @xmath33 ; the observed burst peak flux was @xmath34 ; ) .",
    "such a distance would imply an m@xmath26 intermediate between that of the high inclination 50 minute binary 4u  1916053 and that of the 3.9 hour binary exo  0748676 , as expected .",
    "for a distance of @xmath01124 kpc the system would be @xmath0817 kpc above the galactic plane . as mentioned before",
    "dismiss the identification of ms  1603.6 + 2600 as an adc source on the ground that ms  1603.6 + 2600 is different from 2s  1822371 in many facets .",
    "however , it is unclear if this is enough to dismiss ms  1603.6 + 2600 as an adc source since the group of adc sources is highly disparate .",
    "for instance , 2s  1822371 harbors a high magnetic field neutron star ( ) , 4u  2129 + 47 is a transient system ( ) , and 2s  0921630 has a sub  giant companion star ( p@xmath35 days ; ) .",
    "we conclude that the classification of ms  1603.6 + 2600 depends strongly on whether the x  ray flare observed by was a type i x  ray burst or not .",
    "if it was ms  1603.6 + 2600 is most likely an adc source .",
    "if the flare was just an x  ray flare and not a type i x  ray burst ms  1603.6 + 2600 is either a nearby soft x ",
