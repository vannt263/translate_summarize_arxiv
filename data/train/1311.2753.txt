    "in fig .  [ fig1](right ) we show a possible spectral decomposition ( eckart et al .",
    "2013a ) of the dso using the m - band measurement by gillessen et al .",
    "( 2012a ) .",
    "the interesting arising question is about the nature of the g2/dso k - band emission .",
    "could the k@xmath0-band flux density be due to emission from warm dust ?",
    "most of the mini - spiral dust filaments are externally heated and have a dust temperature of the order of 200  k ( cotera et al . 1999 ) . only in the immediate vicinity of embedded stars ( i.e. irs  3 , irs  7 - at 0.5  angular resolution these are the hottest dust sources known until now ) the dust temperature is of the order of 200 - 300  k ( see cotera et al .",
    "for the dso we need 650  k ( gillessen et al .",
    "2012a ) to explain the k - band emission only by dust .",
    "so it would have to be exceptionally hot and/or have an exceptional overabundance of small grains . at a temperature of only 450  k this scenario",
    "can be excluded ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] right ) . applying the same surface brightness of more than 14@xmath2/arcsec@xmath8 for the dso to the mini - spiral",
    ", it would be much brighter and clearly stand out in its dust emission at 2@xmath7 m , which is in contradiction to the observations .",
    "the alternative is internal heating - however , that would require an internal heating source , i.e. most likely a star . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](right ) we show a decomposition in which we assume that 50% of the current k@xmath0-band flux is due to a late dwarf ( blue line ) , an a / f giant , or agb star ( magenta line ) .",
    "we added to it dust at a temperature of 450  k ( plotted in red ) the sum of the spectra is shown by the thick black line ( dashed at short wavelengths for the af giant / agb case ) .",
    "the points correspond to the l- and k@xmath9-band magnitudes , and h - band upper limit from eckart et al .",
    "( 2013a ) and the m - band measurement and k - band upper limit of gillessen et al .",
    "( 2012ab ) .",
    "red and blue dashed curves also show their 550k and 650k warm dust fits . in solid blue , red , and magenta lines",
    "the emission from three different possible stellar types of the dso core are plotted .",
    "any of these stars embedded in 450k dust ( solid brown line ) can produce the black line that fits all the nir dso photometric measurements .",
    "black body luminosities and the detection of photospheric emission imply possible stellar luminosities of up to 30 l@xmath6  ; i.e. masses of 10 - 20 m@xmath6  are possible .",
    "details are given by eckart et al .",
    "( 2013a ) .    the simulations by jalali et al .",
    "( 2013 , submitted ) show that dusty sources like the dso or the irs13n cluster can actually be formed from small molecular cloud complexes . if they are on elliptical orbits ( e.g. originating from the cnd ) .",
    "the gravitational focusing during the periapse passage close to the sgra * black hole is capable to trigger star formation on time scales required for young massive stars .",
    "this process actually helps forming stars in the vicinity of super massive black holes .",
    "in fig.2 - 3 by eckart et al . ( 2013b ) we compare the g2 tail emission to 8.6@xmath7 m observation taken in 2004 with visir at the eso vlt and in 1994 with the palomar telescope ( stolovy et al .",
    "these mir results , the comparably low proper motion , as well as the possible linkage to the two mini - spiral disk systems , suggest that the tail component ( red in fig  [ fig2]c ) might not be associated with the g2 source but rather is a back / fore - ground dust source associated to the mini - spiral within the central stellar cluster .",
    "the long dust lane feature that crosses the mini - spiral to the south - east of the dso ( fig.7 in gillessen et al .",
    "2013 ) may be a consequence of the interaction between the two rotation gas disk components that are associated with the northern and eastern arms .",
    "details are shown in our fig  [ fig2]abc ( see also fig.21 in zhao et al . 2009 , and fig.10 in vollmer & duschl 2000 ) .",
    "if upcoming observations can confirm that the tail component is not associated with the dso , it does not need to be taken into account in future simulations .",
    "while the dso has a marginal extent in br@xmath4 line emission of about 30mas ( gillessen 2013b ) , it may be compared to other dusty sources in the field ( see eckart et al .",
    "in fact , the dso may be a compact source comparable to the cometary shaped sources x3 and x7 ( muzic et al .",
    "2010 , see also sabha et al .",
    "2014 in prep . ) .",
    "its smaller size compared to x3 and x7 can be explained by the higher particle density within the accretion stream close to sgra * ( e.g. shcherbakov & baganoff 2010 ; see our fig  [ fig2]de ) .",
    "its size also depends on how earlier passages close to sgra * possibly influence the distribution of gas and dust close to a possible star at the center of the dso .",
    "the observations planned for 2014 will be essential to investigate how the close flyby of the dso / g2 object will alter the accretion characteristics of sgra*. the structural evolution of the dso will also show if the dso harbors a star or is a pure gas and dust cloud .",
    "further nir imaging and spectroscopy data will also show if the extended tail component is associated with the head of the dso / g2 source .",
    "theoretical investigations are required to study the formation process for dso like sources and how they are linked to the conditions of star formation in the central stellar cluster .",
    "these studies will also have to address the question of whether the dso is comparable to other dusty sources in the cluster - like the infrared excess irs13n sources ( muzic et al .",
    "2008 , eckart et al .",
    "2012b ) or the bow - shock sources x3 and x7 ( muzic et al . 2007 , 2010 ) .",
    "independent of the answers to these problems , the dso flyby in 2014 will undoubtedly be a spectacular event .",
    "it will reveal valuable information on the physics in the immediate vicinity of super - massive black holes ."
