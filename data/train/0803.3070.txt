    "in the last couple of years , an intense research effort has been directed toward the use of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite to study parton energy loss in strongly - coupled thermal plasmas .",
    "this endeavor is motivated mostly by the quest to understand the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite produced at rhic @xcite and lhc @xcite , and was stimulated by the pioneering works @xcite , which were in turn encouraged by the success of the earlier viscosity calculations @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological literature on energy loss is enormous ; for reviews , see , e.g. , @xcite .    the drag force experienced by a heavy quark traversing an @xmath0 super - yang - mills ( sym ) plasma was determined in @xcite , via its dual description as a string moving on an ads - schwarzschild background .",
    "the closely related diffusion coefficient was obtained independently in @xcite .",
    "these seminal papers have been generalized and elaborated on in a vast number of posterior contributions @xcite , including in particular comparisons with the corresponding weakly - coupled results @xcite , as well as extensive analyses of the energy - momentum tensor which paint a detailed and beautiful picture of the directionality of energy flow away from the moving quark @xcite .    a second line of development originated from the work @xcite , whose authors proposed a recipe for the jet - quenching parameter @xmath1 used in some phenomenological models of energy loss @xcite , and employed it in the context of @xmath0 sym .",
    "their calculation has been extended in a number of directions in @xcite , but also questioned in various ways in @xcite .",
    "a third line was initiated in @xcite , which studied mesons moving through an @xmath0 sym plasma and obtained the corresponding quark - antiquark potential and screening length , using the dual portrayal in terms of a string that moves on an ads - schwarzschild background and has both of its endpoints on the boundary . as was emphasized in @xcite , the outcome",
    "would be expected to have implications for the issue of quarkonium suppression in the qgp .",
    "related results were obtained independently in @xcite , which determined the spectrum of spinning mesons in the confining chiral gauge theory dual to the sakai - sugimoto model @xcite . various interesting extensions and refinements of these calculations",
    "have been reported in @xcite .",
    "a notable feature is that , in contrast with the quark probes considered in @xcite , and the gluon probes studied in @xcite , mesons do _ not _ feel a drag force as they move through the plasma @xcite .",
    "this is because they are color - neutral , and therefore incapable of setting up the long - range gluonic field profiles that could transport energy away from them .",
    "indeed , in @xcite it has been shown that the other obvious color - neutral probe , the baryon , likewise experiences no drag .",
    "besides the transport and jet quenching properties of the plasma , there have also been interesting studies of photoemissivity @xcite and deep inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "some of the topics we have briefly enumerated here have been reviewed in more depth in @xcite .      naturally , the initial papers @xcite carried out their calculations under a number of simplifying assumptions .",
    "first and foremost among these is of course the use of an @xmath0 sym plasma as a toy model for the real - world qgp . a number of extensions to other theories that are in certain ways closer to qcd have already been cited above , and a few others can be found in @xcite .",
    "the issue of how best to compare the @xmath0 sym and qcd parameters was discussed in @xcite . also important",
    "is the restriction to an infinite static plasma .",
    "efforts to examine the case where the plasma is expanding and/or has a finite spatial extent have been made in @xcite .",
    "the plasma produced at rhic or lhc has in addition a finite _ temporal _ extent , so another issue that could be significant is the limitation of the energy loss computations @xcite to the stationary or late - time regime . the actual drag coefficient might be expected to differ from the value obtained in these works in a situation where the quark moving through the plasma is accelerating , or in the initial period following its production within the thermal medium .",
    "this point has been emphasized from the phenomenological perspective ( in the context of collisional energy loss ) in @xcite , where it was argued that , after a quark - antiquark pair is produced , there exists a significant delay before the rate of energy dissipation coincides with the result relevant for the stationary case .",
    "later works @xcite have called into question the actual duration , but not the existence , of this retardation effect .    the estimates in @xcite",
    "are based on perturbative calculations , so it is interesting to inquire into this effect in the strongly - coupled systems available to us through the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "it was this question that got us started on the investigation that led to the present work , which over time has expanded toward various other fronts . for simplicity",
    ", we have carried out our calculations in the context of an @xmath0 plasma , but we expect most of our qualitative conclusions to apply more generally .    now , of course , the restriction in @xcite to the stationary and asymptotic cases was not made gratuitously , but was necessary in order to gain analytic control on the problem of energy loss .",
    "away from these regimes , the evolution of the quark in the thermal plasma , or equivalently , of the string on the ads - schwarzschild geometry , is complicated , and one must resort to a numerical analysis ( aspects of which were explored already in @xcite ) . as we will examine closely in due course ,",
    "the interpretation of the outcome of such an analysis is encumbered by several difficulties , chief among which is our ignorance of the thermal dispersion relation for the quark .",
    "in section [ qnoplasmasec ] we will gain some perspective on these issues by turning off the temperature @xmath2 , and analyzing first the evolution of an isolated quark in vacuum , which is of interest in its own right , and easier to interpret because in this context the form of the dispersion relation is fixed by lorentz invariance .",
    "we begin in section [ infinitemasssec ] by reviewing a remarkable paper by mikhailov @xcite , who constructed an analytic embedding for the string dual to an infinitely - massive quark in @xmath0 sym that follows an _ arbitrary _ timelike trajectory , and extracted from it a rate of energy loss , eq .",
    "( [ emikh ] ) , which turned out to agree with the lienard formula from classical electrodynamics ! in the derivation of his result , mihailov disregarded a total derivative , which we show in ( [ edr ] ) to give precisely the expected dispersion relation for the quark . from the results of @xcite ,",
    "then , we are able to draw two important lessons : first , that , at any given time , the energy of the string includes not only the portion intrinsic to the quark , but also the part that has been radiated by the quark throughout its previous history ; second , that the quark s dispersion relation arises from a total derivative that ends up being evaluated at the string endpoint .",
    "it is natural to wonder how mikhailov s results generalize to the case where the quark has a finite mass , which requires the introduction of probe d7-branes on which the string can end @xcite .",
    "we examine this issue ( still at @xmath3 ) in section [ finitemasssec ] .",
    "interestingly , we discover that the resulting quark dispersion relation , eq .",
    "( [ edrf ] ) , as well as the rate of energy loss , eq .",
    "( [ emikhf ] ) , depend on the external force @xmath4 exerted on the quark , or equivalently , on the string embedding parameter @xmath5 , which in the gauge theory controls the shape of the ` gluon cloud ' surrounding the quark .",
    "the dependence is such that the energy and momentum of the quark reduce to the familiar expressions when @xmath6 , and on the other hand diverge as the force approaches its critical value ( i.e. , the value beyond which @xmath4 would be strong enough to nucleate quark - antiquark pairs out of the vacuum ) .",
    "we finalize our zero - temperature analysis in section [ bhsec ] , noting that the process of energy loss is accompanied by the formation of an event horizon ( and a stationary limit curve ) on the string worldsheet , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ bhfig ] .",
    "armed with the intuition afforded to us by mikhailov s construction , we proceed in section [ qplasmasec ] to the finite - temperature case . in this setting , we are of course limited by the fact that the general solution to the string equation of motion is not known analytically .",
    "nonetheless , we argue that mikhailov s method should admit a @xmath7 generalization , and are able to show in section [ constantvsec ] that this is indeed true for the only thermal solution that is thus far available in closed form , which corresponds to the stationary quark configuration studied in @xcite . the resulting dispersion relation , seen in the second and third line of eq .",
    "( [ emikhgubser ] ) , contains a novel feature that we argue to apply for all finite - temperature configurations , including the quark at rest , eq .",
    "( [ mrest ] ) : it receives a contribution not only from the string endpoint located on the d7-branes , which is directly dual to the quark , but also from the endpoint located at the black hole horizon , which , as we explain , encodes the initial conditions for the joint quark @xmath8 plasma system .    in section [ acceleratedsec ] we consider the more general case where the quark accelerates within the plasma .",
    "after reviewing the work done in this context by the authors of @xcite , we pick up precisely where they left off , integrating the string equation of motion numerically for an initially static quark that is accelerated by an external force over a finite period of time and is thereafter released .",
    "as shown in figs .",
    "[ vfig],[diffmass],[equalmass ] , we find that under such conditions , and for values of the mass in the neighborhood of the charm quark , there exists a period after release where the quark dissipates energy at a rate that is substantially _ smaller _ than the stationary / asymptotic result ( [ eplossgubser ] ) obtained in @xcite . additionally , as seen in fig .",
    "[ lw ] , the rate of energy loss in the initial stage where the quark is pushed by the external force can be almost completely accounted for by the generalized lienard formula ( [ emikhf ] ) , describing radiation in vacuum . in ( [ edrplasma ] ) and the paragraphs immediately following ,",
    "we discuss the form of the thermal dispersion relation for the quark subject to the above initial conditions , incorporating the @xmath4-dependence expected from our zero - temperature results , and explaining in detail the relation to the relativistic expression ( [ drr ] ) proposed in @xcite . in section [ bhplasmasec ]",
    "we then carry over the discussion of the worldsheet black hole from section [ bhsec ] to the @xmath7 context , obtaining a time - dependent analog of the schwarzschild black hole encountered for the stationary case in @xcite , as schematized in fig .",
    "[ bhplasmafig ] .    having explored in some depth the effect of the acceleration on the rate of energy loss for an isolated quark , in section [ qqbarsec ] we introduce the other element of realism whose importance was highlighted by the phenomenological studies @xcite , and",
    "examine a quark that is produced together with its corresponding antiquark at some finite time within the thermal medium .",
    "the gravity description of this system involves a string with _ both _ of its endpoints on the d7-branes , at initially coincident positions .",
    "as we review in section [ qqbarreviewsec ] , an initial exploration of this type of configuration was carried out in @xcite . in section [ qqbargeneralizationsec ]",
    "we show how the one - parameter family of initial conditions considered in that work can be generalized to describe situations with vastly different patterns of excitations for the initial gluonic fields , and more importantly , to the case where the newly - formed quark and antiquark transform in the adjoint instead of the singlet representation of the color gauge group .",
    "curiously , we find that it is only in the adjoint case that the initial quark velocity @xmath9 is freely adjustable . for the singlet case , as in @xcite one must necessarily have @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the velocity ( [ vm ] ) that appeared in different manifestations in the works @xcite , and on the string theory side of the duality corresponds to the proper velocity of light at the location of the string endpoint @xcite .",
    "this identification strongly suggests that @xmath11 should be a limiting velocity , as is implicit in at least @xcite , and is discussed more explicitly in section [ qqbarvmsec ] ( as well as in the very recent works @xcite , which appeared while this paper was in preparation ) .",
    "in section [ qqbartransitionsec ] we study the transition of the @xmath12-@xmath13 pair to the asymptotic regime described by a constant friction coefficient , which as shown in fig .",
    "[ stage2fig ] applies uniformly to all different types of initial conditions . for singlet configurations ,",
    "the initial evolution of the quark is of course drastically affected by the presence of the antiquark . in fig .",
    "[ xtransfig ] we determine the velocity dependence of the transition distance beyond which the quark is effectively in the asymptotic regime . for adjoint configurations , on the other hand ,",
    "the interactions between the quark and antiquark are suppressed at large @xmath14 , and so the two members of the pair evolve independently from the start . in this case",
    "we find that the transition distance is essentially zero .",
    "a natural question is whether the transition to the asymptotic regime occurs right after the quark and antiquark are screened from one other by the plasma .",
    "this requires a determination of the corresponding quark - antiquark potential , and more specifically the screening length , a problem that we turn to in section [ potentialsec ] . after reviewing and comparing in section [ potentialreviewsec ] the results obtained for infinitely - massive quarks in @xcite",
    ", we generalize to the case of finite mass , first at zero temperature in section [ potentialnoplasmasec ] , and then at finite temperature in section [ potentialplasmasec ] .",
    "the resulting potentials are shown in figs .",
    "[ potentialfig ] , [ potentialvfig ] . as expressed in ( [ elinearnoplasma ] ) , ( [ elinearplasma ] ) , ( [ elinearplasmav ] ) , they are found to be linear instead of divergent when the quark and antiquark approach one another , signaling the fact that the color sources in this case are no longer pointlike .    in the finite temperature case ,",
    "the potential implies the velocity - dependence of the screening length @xmath15 presented in figs .",
    "[ lmaxfig2],[lmaxfig4 ] . as seen there ,",
    "compared to the infinitely - massive case examined in @xcite , there is a drastic modification of the behavior at high velocities , which are now bounded by @xmath11 instead of 1 .",
    "the @xmath16-dependence near this limit can be determined analytically and takes the form ( [ one ] ) , instead of the formula ( [ onequarter ] ) obtained in @xcite . over the whole range @xmath17 , and for masses similar to the charm quark , the behavior can be relatively well approximated by ( [ onethirdvm ] ) , which is the obvious generalization of the fit ( [ onethird ] ) proposed in @xcite .",
    "we end the paper by comparing in section [ potentialtransitionsec ] the screening length against the transition distance determined in [ qqbartransitionsec ] . for singlet configurations , we find that the magnitude and velocity - dependence of these two separations are comparable , as shown in fig .",
    "[ xlmaxfig ] .",
    "notice that this is in spite of the fact that the two relevant string configurations are rather different .",
    "a similar statement can be made for adjoint configurations , where both the screening and transition lengths are essentially zero .",
    "we conclude then that , for @xmath12-@xmath13 pairs created within the plasma , the transition to the asymptotic , constant - drag - coefficient regime takes place immediately after the quark and antiquark lose contact with one another . that is to say ,",
    "there is no intermediate stage where the quark and antiquark decelerate independently from one another at a rate that differs substantially from the asymptotic result of @xcite .",
    "our analysis in section [ acceleratedsec ] demonstrates that the gluonic fields around a quark can be disturbed by the application of an external force , to the point of producing a significant modification of the energy dissipation rate in the period immediately following release . by analogy with the results we obtained for singlet quark - antiquark configurations in section [ qqbartransitionsec ]",
    ", we interpret this to mean that the quark has to escape far enough from the disturbed region in order to be screened from its effect .",
    "in any event , given that the actual experimental situation resembles the setup of section [ qqbarsec ] much more closely than that of section [ acceleratedsec ] , the main overall lesson for qgp phenomenology would appear to be that , beyond an initial period which is controled by the screening length , and where the evolution can be modeled relatively well as taking place in vacuum ( and , as such , would be present also in proton - proton collisions ) , the stationary / asymptotic rate of energy dissipation determined in @xcite gives a good approximation to the actual time - dependent dynamics .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the inferences made in this paper regarding dispersion relations and energy loss rates are based on the natural split achieved in @xcite of the total energy of the string .",
    "the latter is conserved on the fixed ads - schwarzschild background , but would of course decrease steadily if we take into account the gravitational ( and dilatonic , etc . )",
    "radiation given off by the string in the course of its evolution . through the gkpw recipe for correlation functions @xcite , it is this radiation ( or , more precisely , the full metric perturbation produced by the string ) , evaluated at the ads boundary , that determines the expectation value of the gauge theory energy - momentum tensor . as has been meticulously studied in @xcite , this tensor contains not just the gross information about the total energy loss rate , but even the fine details about the directionality of the flow and the relative weight of the various dissipation channels .",
    "it would therefore be very interesting to examine more closely this link between dissipated energy as encoded on the string and on the gravitational field ultimately generated by it .",
    "to analyze the motion of heavy quarks in a strongly - coupled @xmath0 @xmath18 sym plasma with coupling @xmath19 and temperature @xmath2 , one must follow the evolution of open strings that end on a stack of @xmath20 d7-branes @xcite living on the ( ads - schwarzschild)@xmath21 geometry @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the string length . in our work",
    "the string will be taken to lie at a fixed position on the @xmath24 ( consistent with the corresponding equations of motion ) , so the angular components of the metric will not play any role .",
    "the d7-branes cover the four gauge theory directions @xmath25 , and extend along the radial ads direction up from the boundary at @xmath26 to a position where they ` end ' ( meaning that the @xmath27 that they are wrapped on shrinks down to zero size ) , whose location @xmath28 is related to the quark mass in a way that we will specify below .    from the gauge theory perspective",
    ", the introduction of the d7-branes in the background ( [ metric ] ) is equivalent to the addition of @xmath20 hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of the @xmath18 gauge group , breaking the supersymmetry down to @xmath29 .",
    "these are the degrees of freedom that we refer to as ` quarks , ' even though they include both spin @xmath30 and spin @xmath31 fields . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the backreaction of the d7-branes on the geometry can be sensibly neglected ; in the field theory this corresponds to working in a ` quenched ' approximation which disregards quark loops ( as well as the positive beta function they would generate ) .",
    "the string dynamics follows as usual from the nambu - goto action @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) denotes the induced metric on the worldsheet . in the static gauge @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and for motion and deformation of the string",
    "purely along direction @xmath38 , the non - zero canonical momentum densities @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 where of course @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "notice that , due to our normalization of @xmath43 , the @xmath44 must be multiplied by @xmath45 to obtain the physical energy and momentum densities .    in the present section",
    "we will restrict attention to the case of vanishing temperature ( @xmath46 ) , in which case we are left in ( [ metric ] ) with a pure ads geometry , and the d7-brane parameter @xmath47 is inversely proportional to the lagrangian mass of the quark , @xmath48    a quark that accelerates in vacuum would be expected to emit chromoelectromagnetic radiation .",
    "this problem has been examined from the classical perspective in @xcite , and quantum - mechanically at weak coupling in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "first steps towards a strong - coupling analysis by means of the ads / cft correspondence were taken in @xcite , which employed tools developed in @xcite to study the dilatonic waves given off by small fluctuations on a radial string in ads@xmath49 , and infer from them the profile of the gluonic field @xmath50 in the presence of a quark undergoing small oscillations .",
    "the results of @xcite painted an interesting picture of the propagation of nonlinear waves in @xmath0 sym , but did not allow a definite identification of waves with the @xmath51 falloff associated with radiation . very recently , this falloff has been successfully detected in the same setup as @xcite through a calculation of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath52 @xcite , which appeared while this paper was in preparation .",
    "the first definite characterization of the radiation rate off an accelerating quark was found much later than @xcite , and by a completely different route , in an important paper by mikhailov @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this author was able to solve the full nonlinear equation of motion for a string on ads@xmath49 , for an _ arbitrary _ timelike trajectory of the string endpoint dual to a heavy quark ! in terms of the coordinates used in ( [ metric ] ) ( where for now @xmath53 ) , his solution is @xmath54 with @xmath55 , and @xmath56 the worldline of the string endpoint at the ads boundary or , equivalently , the worldline of the dual , infinitely massive , quark parametrized by the proper time @xmath57 defined through @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "equation ( [ mikhsol ] ) displays the string worldsheet as a ruled surface in ads@xmath49 , spanned by the straight lines at constant @xmath57 .",
    "combining ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ mikhsol ] ) , the induced metric on the worldsheet is found to be @xmath60 implying in particular that the constant-@xmath57 lines are null , a fact that plays an important role in mikhailov s construction . in the solution ( [ mikhsol ] ) ,",
    "the behavior at time @xmath61 of the string segment located at radial position @xmath62 is completely determined by the behavior of the string endpoint at a retarded time @xmath63 obtained by projecting back toward the boundary along the null line at fixed @xmath57 . from the @xmath64 component of ( [ mikhsol ] ) , parametrizing the quark worldline by @xmath65 instead of @xmath57 , and using @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , this amounts to @xmath68 where the endpoint velocity @xmath69 is meant to be evaluated at @xmath70 . in these same terms , the spatial components of ( [ mikhsol ] ) can be formulated as @xmath71    working in the static gauge @xmath36 , @xmath37 , the total energy of a string that extends all the way down to the boundary i.e. , with @xmath72 , corresponding to an infinitely massive quark follows from the nambu - goto action ( [ nambugoto ] ) as @xmath73 using ( [ tret ] ) and ( [ xmikh ] ) , mikhailov was able to reexpress this energy ( via a change of integration variable @xmath74 ) as a local functional of the quark trajectory , @xmath75 ^ 2}{\\left(1-\\vec{v}^{\\,2}\\right)^3 } + e_q(\\vec{v}(t))~,\\ ] ] where of course @xmath76 .",
    "the second term in the above equation arises from a total derivative that was not explicitly written down by mikhailov , but can easily be worked out to be @xmath77 which gives the expected lorentz - invariant dispersion relation for the quark .",
    "the energy split achieved in ( [ emikh ] ) therefore admits a clear and pleasant physical interpretation : @xmath78 is the intrinsic energy of the quark at time @xmath79 , and the integral over @xmath70 encodes the accumulated energy _",
    "lost _ by the quark over all times prior to @xmath79 .",
    "no less remarkable is the fact that the rate of energy loss for the quark in this strongly - coupled non - abelian theory is found to be in precise agreement with the standard lienard formula from classical electrodynamics !    for the momentum of the string , mikhailov analogously found @xmath80 ^ 2}{\\left(1-\\vec{v}^{\\,2}\\right)^3 } \\vec{v}+\\vec{p}_q(\\vec{v}(t))~,\\ ] ] where the second term can be worked out to be @xmath81 and encodes the momentum intrinsic to the quark .",
    "the last two equations also follow from ( [ emikh ] ) and ( [ edr ] ) through lorentz invariance .",
    "it is interesting to consider how these results are modified in the case @xmath82 , where the mass @xmath83 of the quark given by ( [ zmnoplasma ] ) is large but not infinite .",
    "as we have reviewed above , in mikhailov s original solution ( [ mikhsol ] ) the evolution of the string at any radial position @xmath62 follows from knowledge of the trajectory of the endpoint at the ads boundary . for a finite - mass quark , we ought to impose boundary conditions on the string not at @xmath26 but at @xmath28 : given the worldline @xmath84 of the quark , we must require that the string worldsheet satisfy @xmath85 . moreover , we need only determine the behavior of the string in the region @xmath86 .",
    "the required physical solution can of course be viewed as merely the @xmath86 portion of one particular instance of the general solution found by mikhailov .",
    "our task is therefore to reexpress ( [ mikhsol ] ) in terms of the data @xmath84 at the new boundary @xmath28 , instead of the ( now merely auxiliary ) data at the ads boundary @xmath26 , which we will henceforth distinguish with a tilde : @xmath87 . for simplicity",
    ", we will carry out this translation explicitly only in a setup where the quark moves purely along direction @xmath38 , which is all that we will need for our analysis in subsequent sections .",

    "equation ( [ xdot ] ) implies that the quark acceleration @xmath96 depends not only on @xmath94 and @xmath95 , but also on the second time derivative of @xmath94 . because of this , it is not possible to solve for @xmath94 and @xmath95 , the quantities that appear directly in mikhailov s energy formula ( [ emikh ] ) , in terms of @xmath16 and @xmath97 , the data that we would naively expect to suffice to characterize the rate of energy loss of the heavy quark .    on the other hand , from ( [ tret ] ) and ( [ xmikh ] ) we can infer as well that @xmath98 so it is certainly possible to solve for @xmath90 in terms of @xmath16 and @xmath99 .",
    "notice that when @xmath100 , we automatically have @xmath101 , which explains why this parameter was not needed in the description of the infinitely - massive quark . for @xmath82 ,",
    "the value of @xmath99 encodes how much the string tip tilts away from the vertical .",
    "but what does this mean in gauge - theoretic language ? through a calculation of @xmath102 or @xmath103 in parallel with that of @xcite ,",
    "the slant of the string will have an impact on the shape of the gluonic field profile in the immediate vicinity of the heavy quark : for @xmath104 , this profile is not spherically symmetric .",
    "we find it physically more transparent to express the rate of energy loss in terms not of @xmath99 but of the string momentum density @xmath105 given by ( [ momenta ] ) , which by use of ( [ xdot ] ) and ( [ xprime ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath106 when evaluated at @xmath28 , this controls the external force @xmath107 acting on the string endpoint , or equivalently , on the quark .",

    "the second term again denotes a surface term and gives the modified dispersion relation for the finite - mass quark , @xmath112    starting instead from mikhailov s formula ( [ pmikh ] ) for the momentum , we find @xmath113+p_q(v(t),f(t ) ) ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath114    notice that @xmath115 , which for @xmath111 and @xmath116 differs from the result expected for a pointlike quark , @xmath117 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the fundamental source dual to a string that terminates at @xmath82 is indeed _ not pointlike_. according to the standard uv / ir connection @xcite , it has a linear size of order @xmath47 , and it is only because of this extended nature that , as we saw above , to characterize its state one needs to specify not only the velocity @xmath16 but also the parameter @xmath4 ( or @xmath99 ) that encodes its shape .",
    "the crucial point here is that the source in question should not be thought of as a bare quark , but as a ` dressed ' or ` constituent ' quark , surrounded by a gluonic cloud with thickness @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we will see more evidence of this in section [ potentialsec ] .",
    "another salient feature of the energy and momentum of the quark given by expressions ( [ edrf ] ) and ( [ pdrf ] ) is the fact that they both diverge as the value of the external force approaches @xmath118 the reason for this is easy to understand on the string theory side . to exert a force @xmath4 on the string endpoint , within the d7-branes",
    "we must turn on an electric field that has strength @xmath119 at @xmath28 . working in static gauge , the born - infeld lagrangian on the d7-branes",

    "the physical origin of this bound is the fact that , for @xmath122 , the creation of open strings is energetically favored , and so the system is unstable . according to ( [ edrf ] ) and ( [ pdrf ] ) , then , the energy and momentum of the constituent quark diverge precisely at the point where the external force becomes capable of nucleating quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "it is interesting to consider the evolution of the string in the case where the quark is accelerated by an external force @xmath123 over some period of time and is then set free at a time @xmath124 .",
    "if we put @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) in ( [ vtildeatilde ] ) , then @xmath127 ( the acceleration of the auxiliary @xmath26 endpoint of the string vanishes ) , which in turn implies through ( [ xdot ] ) and ( [ xprime ] ) that @xmath128 and @xmath129 at all points on the same null ( constant @xmath70 ) line , independently of the value of @xmath62 . in particular , the lower ( @xmath28 ) endpoint of the string travels at speed @xmath130 , which means that that , for @xmath131 , the quark moves at constant velocity @xmath16 , as one would expect given the fact that it is in vacuum .",
    "as time progresses , the null line that departs from the point @xmath132 , which according to ( [ tret ] ) is given by @xmath133 reaches further away from the ads boundary , so there is an increasing portion of the string ( @xmath134 ) that is completely vertical and moves with the same final velocity @xmath16 . as @xmath135 , this vertical segment describes a quark that moves at constant speed and is surrounded by a stationary gluonic field profile , related to that of a static quark through a lorentz transformation .    at any given time @xmath136 , then , the energy and momentum previously radiated by the quark are stored as excess energy and momentum on the portion of the string above @xmath137 .",
    "this suggests the existence of a geometric region on the worldsheet that ` absorbs ' the surplus @xmath138 and @xmath139 .    to define this region more precisely",

    "if we follow the point @xmath137 as @xmath135 ( reaching the spacetime horizon for the poincar patch , @xmath144 ) , and then project back along the _ downward _ pointing light half - cone @xmath145 , we delineate a region ( @xmath146 ) on the string worldsheet from which , by construction , no signal can escape to the asymptotic region corresponding to the final vertical and stationary segment of the string . in other words ,",
    "the curve @xmath147 so obtained , which we will henceforth denote by @xmath148 , is the event horizon of a worldsheet black hole .",
    "a worldsheet black hole figured prominently in the energy loss analysis of @xcite , concerning a quark in a thermal plasma .",
    "those works considered the steady - state configuration where the quark moves at a constant velocity @xmath16 ; as a consequence , the black hole they encountered was static , with an event horizon located at the fixed position @xmath149 , precisely the radius that played a crucial role in the drag force calculation of @xcite .    in our non - stationary system ,",
    "on the other hand , the worldsheet black hole is dynamical .",
    "let us focus for concreteness on the case where the quark is static up to a time @xmath150 , and is then accelerated until @xmath151 .",
    "the location @xmath148 of the event horizon will begin descending from @xmath144 even before @xmath150 ( in anticipation of the disturbance produced by the acceleration at the lower endpoint ) , reach a minimum value of the radial coordinate , and then move up again , approaching @xmath137 as @xmath135 .",

    "this means that the entire upward portion of @xmath148 must lie within the region of maximal disturbance of the worldsheet , i.e. , in the diagonal swath between @xmath154 and @xmath155 .    as usual ,",

    "sadly , we have not been able to accomplish this feat .",
    "nevertheless , based on the results discussed in the previous subsection , we expect the total energy of the string at any given time to again decompose into a surface term that encodes the intrinsic energy of the quark and an integrated local term that reflects the energy lost by the quark .",
    "_ a priori _ it might not be obvious that the rate of energy loss in the presence of the strongly - coupled non - abelian plasma should be given by some expression that depends just on the behavior of the quark at the given instant , and not on its previous history .",
    "but in the ads / cft context , this property is strongly suggested by the fact that the energy of the string is given by a local expression on the worldsheet just as much in the ads - schwarzschild background that is dual to the thermal plasma as in the pure ads background that corresponds to the sym vacuum ( which , one should not forget , is in itself a nonlinear medium ) . starting with @xmath138 written as an integral over @xmath62 , it should again be possible to project back to the boundary along null trajectories , to obtain a formula that depends locally on the quark worldline @xmath84 . the main difference with the zero - temperature case",
    "would be that the null trajectories are no longer straight lines .",
    "we have verified that these expectations are borne out in the case of the only finite - temperature solution that is known analytically : the stationary configuration of @xcite , @xmath177~,\\ ] ] which describes a quark moving at constant velocity @xmath16 .",

    "we can see that , just like at zero temperature , @xmath189 reduces to @xmath16 only in the pointlike limit @xmath100 .",
    "an important difference with respect to the @xmath3 case analyzed in the previous subsection is that here the surface contribution that determines the quark dispersion relation arises not only from the lower ( @xmath28 ) but also from the upper ( @xmath190 ) endpoint of the string .",
    "this is in fact the generic situation in the @xmath7 case , and holds even for the static radial string , where there is of course no energy loss term and @xmath138 is given just by a boundary contribution that defines the thermal rest mass of the quark , @xmath191    clearly the second term in ( [ mrest ] ) , just like the terms in the third line of ( [ emikhgubser ] ) and ( [ pmikhgubser ] ) , arises from the string endpoint located at the black hole horizon .",
    "it is natural then to wonder to what extent these terms should be regarded as a contribution to the intrinsic energy of the quark , because their value at any given time does not depend on the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath4 ( or @xmath99 ) that characterize the state of the _ lower _ endpoint at the same instant .",
    "in fact , since @xmath192 marks the position of an event horizon , for any finite coordinate time @xmath79 the value of the surface contribution at @xmath192 is not influenced by the behavior of the @xmath193 portion of the string , but depends only on the string s configuration at @xmath194 .",
    "the same interpretation can be then carried over to the gauge theory : the seemingly extraneous terms represent a contribution to the energy of the state that depends solely on the initial configuration of the quark@xmath8plasma system . throughout the evolution ,",
    "causality guarantees that the behavior of the sym fields at spatial infinity can only be affected by the initial configuration at @xmath194 , so we can equivalently think of the surface terms at @xmath192 as encoding information on the asymptotic boundary conditions for the system . indeed , for dynamical processes , the radial location @xmath190 in ads - schwarzschild corresponds to the deep ir of the gauge theory .",
    "we conclude then that , to the extent that we wish to compare the energies of configurations with different initial / boundary conditions , it is important to keep track of the terms arising from the surface contribution at the horizon , despite the fact that they are generally independent of the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath4 associated with the intrinsic dynamics of the quark .",
    "notice , in particular , that with this interpretation the negative sign in the second term of ( [ mrest]) which is at first sight unexpected when viewed as the leading - order thermal correction to the quark mass @xcite becomes easier to digest : it reflects the screening effect of the plasma on the long - range gluonic fields set up by the quark , which implies a _ reduction _ of the energy stored in the ir , in comparison with the @xmath3 case .",
    "it is instructive to compare ( [ emikhgubser ] ) with the alternative split achieved in @xcite , @xmath195 with @xmath196 . if one could interpret this latter quantity as the total distance traversed by the quark since the beginning of time , then the first term in ( [ ehkkky ] ) would give the overall energy lost by the quark , at the known rate ( [ eplossgubser ] ) , in the total elapsed time @xmath197",
    "in view of ( [ mrest ] ) , the second term would then imply a standard relativistic dispersion relation for the quark , with mass @xmath198 .",
    "the problem with this interpretation , however ( alluded to already in @xcite ) , is that it does not properly address the issue of initial conditions .",
    "the actual distance travelled by the quark is by definition @xmath199 , which agrees with @xmath200 only if @xmath201 . , we of course have in mind evaluating the corresponding quantities at a time that is fixed but arbitrarily far in the past . ]",
    "this last equality would hold if we had started at @xmath194 with the quark at rest ( i.e. , with the string static and completely vertical ) , but the energy - loss term in ( [ ehkkky ] ) makes no allowance for an initial period of acceleration .",
    "in contrast with this , the separation obtained in ( [ emikhgubser ] ) has a clear geometric origin in the context of the generalization pursued here of mikhailov s work @xcite to the finite - temperature case . within this framework ,",
    "the portion @xmath202 of the total string energy @xmath203 that is contributed by the segment of the string in the immediate vicinity of the horizon ( located at @xmath204 in the notation of ( [ gubsersol ] ) , or @xmath205 in the notation of ( [ gubsermikhsol ] ) ) was lost by the quark at a particular time @xmath70 in the distant past that can be deduced from ( [ gubsertret ] ) . since this is the highest segment of the string that contributes to @xmath203 , @xmath70 marks the precise instant when we need to begin our accounting of the energy lost by the quark . at @xmath206 the lower endpoint of the string ( and , hence , the quark )",

    "stems from the steady - state nature of the configuration under scrutiny . in the general case , clearly it is a very non - trivial property for a particular contribution to the energy @xmath203 of the string to be expressible as a functional only of the state of the endpoints at the given instant . ]",
    "having gained some intuition from the analysis of a quark moving as in @xcite at constant speed relative to the strongly - coupled plasma , let us now turn our attention to the more general situation where the quark accelerates . in @xcite ,",
    "a few important steps were taken to have a better understanding of this case ; in the next few paragraphs we will briefly review the key results .",
    "a quark that undergoes _ any _ type of ( forced or unforced ) motion ( and , in the former case , is thereafter released ) will be slowed down by its interaction with the plasma , and eventually come to rest .",
    "the authors of @xcite studied the late - time ( and consequently low - velocity , low - acceleration ) behavior of such a quark , by considering small , exponentially damped fluctuations around the final rest configuration .",
    "in dual language , this involves a determination of the quasi - normal modes on the worldsheet of a static and purely radial string . from their analysis",
    "they were able to numerically deduce , for any given quark mass parameter @xmath47 , the value of the drag coefficient @xmath211 as long as one maintains the restriction to the non - relativistic regime , the above definition is equivalent to @xmath212 , and by construction yields a result that is independent of @xmath139 ( or @xmath16 ) .",
    "a few representative values were tabulated in @xcite .    additionally , the authors of @xcite gave an analytic derivation of the low - velocity dispersion relation for the quark , which they found to take the form @xmath213 where @xmath198 is the thermal rest mass ( [ mrest ] ) , and @xmath214 the kinetic mass of the quark .",

    "( [ drr ] ) and the relation @xmath221 that one would naively infer from the second term in ( [ ehkkky ] ) , the authors of @xcite emphasized the need for a more detailed study of the quark s intrinsic dynamics , and proposed a plan of attack .",
    "they observed that if one starts with the quark at rest in the hot medium , and then accelerates it with an external force , then as long as energy dissipation is negligible , it is natural to define the total intrinsic energy of the quark as the initial rest energy plus the work done by the external agent .",
    "motivated by this proposal , we have studied the early - time behavior of a quark initially at rest , which is accelerated by a time - dependent external force that is turned off after a short period of time , allowing the quark to move thereafter only under the influence of the plasma .",
    "as we already mentioned , regrettably , we have not been able to find a general exact solution to the nambu - goto equation of motion for the string in the non - stationary case .",
    "nevertheless , it is certainly possible to find numerical solutions that describe string configurations dual to the gauge theory setup described above .",
    "starting at @xmath222 , a string extending from a fixed value of the radial coordinate @xmath28 to the horizon at @xmath190 , initially at rest and vertical , is accelerated by applying an external force @xmath123 to its lower endpoint . after a time @xmath223 , this external force",

    "while this paper was in preparation , the work @xcite appeared , which includes an explicit derivation of the dispersion relation for mesons , described as open string modes on the d7-branes , following @xcite . for large meson momentum @xmath139 ,",
    "their calculation resulted in @xmath567 , with @xmath11 the limiting velocity defined in ( [ vm ] ) and discussed further in section [ qqbarvmsec ] of the present paper ( as well as in @xcite , which also appeared while our work was being written up ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite emphasized that the @xmath192- and @xmath47-dependence of @xmath11 implies a bound on the temperature at which a meson with velocity @xmath16 can exist within the plasma . interpreting the maximal allowed temperature as a dissociation temperature , they found the scaling @xmath559 , just like the heuristic argument based on the potential for infinitely - massive and ultra - relativistic quarks had suggested @xcite .",
    "given the results of @xcite and the present subsection , we are not quite sure what to make of this agreement . as explained above , for finite mass the quark - antiquark potential does _ not _ scale as @xmath568 even in the ` ultra - relativistic ' region ( which is now @xmath447 ) .",
    "so the fact that the heuristic argument in @xcite based on the potential suggests the same scaling with velocity as the direct calculation in @xcite might be a coincidence , or it might indicate that there is a direct physical connection between the dissociation temperature and the potential only when the latter is computed for infinitely - massive quarks . in any case , it should be emphasized that the @xmath503 scaling follows not from the detailed computation of the dispersion relation in @xcite , but from the temperature - dependence of the limiting velocity ( [ vm ] ) .      in fig .",
    "[ xtransfig ] at the end of the previous section , we determined the location @xmath468 beyond which a quark and antiquark created ( with zero total momentum ) within the plasma begin to slow down at the asymptotic rate specified by the constant friction coefficient obtained for an isolated quark in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath12-@xmath13 separations larger than @xmath569 , then , the two particles are definitely oblivious to one another and evolve independently .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare the transition distance @xmath472 against ( half of ) the screening length @xmath15 determined in the present section , which gives a measure of the minimal distance at which the quark and antiquark can decouple .    for singlet configurations , the result of this comparison",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ xlmaxfig ] , where we see that the two separations are of comparable magnitude and scale with velocity in a similar manner .",
    "notice that this is in spite of the fact that the two relevant string configurations are quite different , with motion respectively along and perpendicular to the plane in which the string extends .",
    "we conclude then that the transition to the constant - drag - coefficient regime takes place immediately after the quark and antiquark lose contact with one another . that is to say , unlike what we found for the forced isolated quark in section [ acceleratedsec ] , here",
    "there is no intermediate stage where the quark and antiquark decelerate independently from one another at a rate that differs substantially from the asymptotic result of @xcite .",
    "the initial stage , where as seen in fig .",
    "[ stage2fig ] the quark and antiquark dissipate energy at a rate _ larger _ than ( [ eplossgubser ] ) , corresponds to the period when the string has not fallen close enough to the black hole horizon . in other words , to a first approximation , the quark and antiquark evolve in this region as they would in the absence of the thermal plasma . to the extent that this result , with all its simplifying assumptions ,",

    ", this is visible in the fact that the ` line ' initial conditions ( [ lineic ] ) can be regarded as describing two disjoint strings extending all the way from the d7-branes to the horizon . in the classical limit where our calculations are carried out",
    ", these two halves do not influence one another , because signals propagating between them would have to pass through the horizon , and their splitting / joining / annihilating is suppressed by powers of the string coupling @xmath573 , which is taken to zero . at this level of approximation , then , the quark and antiquark do not see one another , so the relevant ` screening length ' is @xmath574 .",
    "this is consistent with the result @xmath474 we obtained for the adjoint case in section [ qqbartransitionsec ] .",
    "the fact that in the adjoint case the quark and antiquark evolve independently from the start makes this case directly comparable to our study of isolated quarks in section [ acceleratedsec ] .",
    "interestingly , the corresponding results seem to point in opposite directions : whereas for an initially static quark that is externally forced we identified a short period after release where the quark loses energy at a rate significantly _ smaller _ than the stationary / asymptotic rate ( [ eplossgubser ] ) , for a quark that is created with a certain initial velocity and gluonic field profile and thereafter moves only under the influence of the plasma we found an initial rate of dissipation that is somewhat _ larger _ than ( [ eplossgubser ] )",
    ".    it seems , then , that the initial conditions can , to a certain extent , influence the subsequent evolution , which does not seem altogether surprising given the nonlinear nature of the medium .",
    "the application of an external force in section [ acceleratedsec ] clearly has a significant effect on the shape of the string at the time of release , or in other words , on the gluonic field configuration surrounding the quark . in view of our results for quark - antiquark evolution in this and the previous section , the initial period over which this disturbed quark behaves unlike what one would expect based on @xcite",
    "should most likely be interpreted as reflecting the time it takes the quark to stabilize the gluonic fields around it , or , equivalently , to move far enough away from the disturbed region to be effectively screened from it . in any case",
    ", one should of course not lose sight of the fact that the actual experimental situation resembles the setup of section [ qqbarsec ] more closely than that of section [ acceleratedsec ] .",

    "<S> we explore various aspects of the motion of heavy quarks in strongly - coupled gauge theories , employing the ads / cft correspondence . building on earlier work by mikhailov , we study the dispersion relation and energy loss of an accelerating finite - mass quark in @xmath0 super - yang - mills , both in vacuum and in the presence of a thermal plasma . in the former case , </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the application of an external force modifies the dispersion relation . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> , we find in particular that when a static heavy quark is accelerated by an external force , its rate of energy loss is initially insensitive to the plasma , and there is a delay before this rate approaches the value derived previously from the analysis of stationary or late - time configurations .    </S>",
    "<S> following up on work by herzog _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> , we also consider the evolution of a quark and antiquark as they separate from one another after formation , learning how the ads / cft setup distinguishes between the singlet and adjoint configurations , and locating the transition to the stage where the deceleration of each particle is properly accounted for by a constant friction coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we examine the way in which the energy of a quark - antiquark pair moving jointly through the plasma scales with the quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the velocity - dependence of the screening length is drastically modified in the ultra - relativistic region , and is comparable with that of the transition distance mentioned above . </S>"
