    "observations show that galaxies located in dense environments such as clusters of galaxies are mostly dominated by an old stellar population with little or no star - formation nor cold gas .",
    "this effect is likely caused by ram - pressure stripping of the gas in galaxies as they travel with high speed through the hot intracluster gas that permeates all clusters .",
    "but where and when do galaxies start losing their cold gas ?",
    "what are their trajectories and how long does it take them to lose their gas ? in this paper , we use high - resolution cosmological simulations to investigate these questions of how galaxies lose their cold gas as they fall into clusters of galaxies .",
    "t has long been known that the local environment affects galaxy properties .",
    "earlier work @xcite showed that the fraction of early - type galaxies increases dramatically towards the central regions of clusters of galaxies , while the less dense regions of the field are dominated by spiral galaxies .",
    "similarly , the `` color - density relation '' @xcite indicates that red , old galaxies are found preferentially in over - dense environments , while galaxies with bluer , younger stellar populations are more common in the field .",
    "this color bimodality is linked to a transition in star formation rates between the low - density field and the high - density regions inside clusters @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we still do not have a complete picture of the process through which blue , late - type , star - forming galaxies in the field transform into red , early - type galaxies when entering a cluster .",
    "we know that cold gas in galaxies is spatially extended and often distributed far beyond the optical disks @xcite .",
    "cosmologically , some of the cold gas that feeds galaxy formation may come from the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "observations suggest that neutral hydrogen feeds galaxies and turns into molecular hydrogen at a high column density of @xmath2@xmath3 @xcite within which star formation is observed to occur .",
    "together , these facts suggest that the amount of neutral hydrogen supply may ultimately set the rate of star formation .",
    "the environmental dependence of galaxy properties may thus be related to the availability of cold gas in or around galaxies .",
    "this expectation is supported by observations of galaxies in different environments showing the well - known depletion of both cold gas and star - formation towards the high - density central regions of clusters ; this is likely caused by ram - pressure stripping of the cold gas by the hot intracluster medium ( plus additional gravitational interactions ) in the dense environments ( see e.g. , , and references therein ) .",
    "recent detailed observations of on - going gas depletion from galaxies in clusters are presented by the vla survey of hi in virgo galaxies showing long tails of stripped gas behind galaxies , where the gas clumps in the tails are accelerated by ram - pressure , leaving behind streams of new stars @xcite .",
    "long tails of hi and ionized gas are observed in galaxies in several nearby clusters , consistent with the above picture ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this study , we utilize an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) cluster simulation to investigate where galaxies lose their cold gas ( @xmath4 ) as a function of their distance from the cluster center , as well as the orbital trajectories of these galaxies .",
    "the physical processes responsible for the transition of the blue , late - type , star - forming galaxies into red , early - type galaxies when falling into clusters depend on the local density of the environment , and in return they are related to the radial distance from the cluster center .",
    "therefore , the radial distribution of gas - rich galaxies from the innermost regions of clusters and up to several virial radii away from the cluster center can provide important information about galaxy evolution and the density - morphology relation .",
    "we also study the distribution of velocity orientations for gas - rich galaxies and for the general galaxy population since the efficiency of the processes driving galaxy evolution may depend on the orbital trajectories of these galaxies and the time they spend traversing the cluster before losing all their gas . while we focus on the questions of where and when galaxies lose their cold gas , and what the trajectories of the infalling galaxies are , our analysis is consistent with ram pressure stripping playing a major role in removing the cold gas from galaxies ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "gravitational interactions @xcite may provide additional contributions to the gas dispersal or removal .",
    "we discuss this in a more detailed analysis presented in @xcite where we demonstrate that hydrodynamic processes such as ram - pressure stripping play a dominant role in affecting cold gas content in galaxies , although the effectiveness of gas removal by ram pressure stripping is strongly dependent on the internal properties of galaxies .",
    "we perform cosmological simulations with the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) eulerian hydro code enzo @xcite .",
    "our simulations feature the largest sample of galaxies in a fully cosmological setting with sufficient resolution to study gas removal , and they include the most detailed physical processes as discussed below .",
    "this enables a greatly improved understanding of the gas loss behaviour .",
    "it is useful to compare with some relevant previous work on this subject . in",
    ", n - body simulations are combined with semi - analytic treatments of hydrodynamic effects .",
    "a significant advantage of their work is a very large cosmological volume , hence a large sample of clusters , but with a significant drawback due to the less realistic treatment for the gas . in , high resolution hydrodynamic simulations",
    "are used to investigate ram - pressure stripping for a variety of conditions . nevertheless , their setup for both the structure of galaxies being stripped and the intra - cluster medium are highly idealized .",
    "procedure - wise , we first run a low resolution simulation with a periodic box of @xmath5mpc ( comoving ) on a side .",
    "we identify a region centered on a cluster of mass @xmath6 at @xmath7 .",
    "we then resimulate with high resolution the chosen region embedded in the outer @xmath8mpc box to properly take into account the large - scale tidal field and appropriate boundary conditions at the surface of a refined region .",
    "the refined region has a comoving size of @xmath9mpc@xmath10 and represents a @xmath11 matter density fluctuation on that volume .",
    "the dark matter particle mass in the refined region is @xmath12 .",
    "the refined region is surrounded by two layers ( each of @xmath13mpc ) of buffer zones with particle masses successively larger by a factor of @xmath14 for each layer , which then connects with the outer root grid that has a dark matter particle mass @xmath15 times that in the refined region .",
    "we choose the mesh refinement criterion such that the resolution is always smaller than @xmath16pc ( physical ) , corresponding to a maximum mesh refinement level of @xmath17 at @xmath7 .",
    "an identical comparison run that has four times better resolution of @xmath18pc / h and eight times better mass resolution ( dark matter particle mass of @xmath19 ) was also run down to @xmath20 and relevant comparisons between the two simulations are made to understand effects of limited resolution on our results .",
    "the simulations include a metagalactic uv background @xcite , and a model for shielding of uv radiation @xcite . they also include metallicity - dependent radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "our simulations solve relevant gas chemistry chains for molecular hydrogen formation @xcite , molecular formation on dust grains @xcite , and metal cooling extended down to @xmath21k @xcite .",
    "star particles are created in cells that satisfy a set of criteria for star formation proposed by @xcite .",
    "each star particle is tagged with its initial mass , creation time , and metallicity ; star particles typically have masses of @xmath22 .",
    "supernova feedback from star formation is modeled following @xcite .",
    "feedback energy and ejected metal - enriched mass are distributed into 27 local gas cells centered at the star particle in question , weighted by the specific volume of each cell , which is to mimic the physical process of supernova blastwave propagation that tends to channel energy , momentum and mass into the least dense regions ( with the least resistance and cooling ) .",
    "the primary advantages of this supernova energy based feedback mechanism are three - fold .",
    "first , nature does drive winds in this way and energy input is realistic .",
    "second , it has only one free parameter @xmath23 , namely , the fraction of the rest mass energy of stars formed that is deposited as thermal energy on the cell scale at the location of supernovae .",
    "third , the processes are treated physically , obeying their respective conservation laws ( where they apply ) , allowing transport of metals , mass , energy and momentum to be treated self - consistently and taking into account relevant heating / cooling processes at all times . we allow the entire feedback processes to be hydrodynamically coupled to the surroundings and subject to relevant physical processes such as cooling and heating .",
    "the total amount of explosion kinetic energy from type ii supernovae with a chabrier initial mass function ( imf ) is @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is the speed of light ) , for a mass @xmath26 of star formed . taking into account the contribution of prompt type",
    "i supernovae , we use @xmath27 in our simulations . observations of local starburst galaxies indicate that nearly all of the sf produced kinetic energy is used to power galactic superwinds @xcite .",
    "supernova feedback is important primarily for regulating sf and for transporting energy and metals into the intergalactic medium .",
    "the extremely inhomogeneous metal enrichment process demands that both metals and energy ( and momentum ) are correctly modeled so that they are transported in a physically sound way ( albeit still approximate at the current resolution ) .",
    "we use the following cosmological parameters that are consistent with the wmap7-normalized @xcite @xmath28cdm model : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we identify galaxies in our high resolution simulations using the hop algorithm operating on the stellar particles ; this algorithm is tested to be robust and insensitive to specific choices of parameters within reasonable ranges .",
    "galaxies above a mass of @xmath35 are clearly identified in our simulation .",
    "the luminosity of each stellar particle is computed for each of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) five bands using the gissel stellar synthesis code @xcite , by supplying the formation time , metallicity and stellar mass .",
    "collecting luminosity and other quantities of member stellar particles , gas cells and dark matter particles yields the following physical parameters for each galaxy : position , velocity , total mass , stellar mass , gas mass , mean formation time , mean stellar metallicity , mean gas metallicity , star formation rate ( sfr ) , luminosities in five sdss bands ( and related colors ) , and others . at redshift @xmath7 , we identify 14 groups and clusters of mass @xmath36 to @xmath37 , which are the `` clusters '' in the subsequent analysis . at a spatial resolution of @xmath38pc / h ( physical ) with thousands of",
    "well resolved galaxies at @xmath39 , the simulated galaxy catalogs represent an excellent tool to study galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : radial ] shows the fraction of gas - rich galaxies as a function of the cluster - centric distance in units of the virial radius of the cluster , where the virial radius @xmath40 is defined as the radius within which the mass overdensity is @xmath41 times the critical density .",
    "we consider two redshift ranges , @xmath42 ( red curves ) and @xmath43 ( blue curves ) , as well as two different thresholds in the gas to total baryon ratio : @xmath44 ( dashed curves ) and @xmath45 ( solid curves ) .",
    "this @xmath46 ratio is defined to be the cold ( @xmath4 ) gas - fraction relative to total baryons in galaxies within their @xmath47 .",
    "as we can see in figure  [ fig : radial ] , the fraction of gas - rich galaxies beyond three virial radii of the cluster approaches a constant value for both thresholds in gas to total baryon ratio .",
    "a clear trend is observed inward of @xmath48 cluster virial radii : the fraction of gas - rich galaxies decreases monotonically with decreasing cluster - centric distance .",
    "this trend is in good agreement with observations that the hi gas depletion increases with decreasing cluster - centric distance inward of about two virial radii .",
    "intriguingly , observations indicate that the distribution of star formation rates of cluster galaxies begins to change , compared with the field population , at a clustercentric radius of @xmath49 virial radii .",
    "this effect with clustercentric radius is most noticeable for strongly star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "since cold gas is the fuel for star formation , our finding for the cold gas dependence on cluster - centric distance provides a natural physical explanation for the observed trend of galaxy properties as a function of environment .",
    "it is prudent to perform a numerical convergence test on the relevant results obtained above . in figure",
    "[ fig : conv ] we show a comparison between our fiducial run  cz3 \" and a higher resolution run  c15 \" ( 4 times better resolution ) , at redshifts @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "while an absolute agreement is not expected , the results are encouraging and self - consistent . in the higher resolution run  c15 \" , star formation in smaller galaxies ( @xmath52 ) is much better captured than in  cz3 \" .",
    "thus , more gas is converted into stars in these systems , and star formation begins at earlier times in ",
    "c15 \" than in  cz3 \" . as a result",
    ", we expect the absolute amount of cold gas around galaxies at low redshift in  c15 \" to be lower than in  cz3 \" , as is indeed seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : conv ] .",
    "nevertheless , the same trend is observed in both runs : there is a monotonic decrease in the fraction of gas - rich galaxies with decreasing cluster - centric distance within @xmath53 of the cluster center , and there is a flattening in the gas fraction at larger radii .",
    "observations suggest that the gas - fraction in galaxies , observed as @xmath54 , decreases with their stellar mass @xmath55 ( and/or their halo mass ) , and with the mass of the cluster in which they are located ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the trend of @xmath56 in our simulations is found to be consistent with the observed decrease of galactic gas - fraction with increasing galaxy mass as well as with increasing cluster mass .",
    "we find that the @xmath56 trend versus @xmath26 is not limited to the cluster environment but it is also seen outside of clusters .",
    "these results are to be presented elsewhere .",
    "we examine two additional questions : what are the orbits of gas - rich galaxies in and around clusters ?",
    "how long does it take for the gas - rich galaxies to lose gas upon entering a cluster ?",
    "figure  [ fig : vr ] shows histograms of gas - rich galaxies as a function of their radial velocity ( in units of the cluster virial velocity ) , for four radial ranges at @xmath42 .",
    "infalling galaxies are defined to have negative radial velocities , whereas outgoing galaxies have positive radial velocities .",
    "it is seen that in the radial range @xmath57 ( top - left panel ) gas - rich galaxies preferentially have negative velocities with an amplitude peaking at about unity ( @xmath58 ) , which should be compared to the general galaxy population that displays a nearly symmetric distribution peaked around zero .",
    "it is also interesting to note that there are nearly no gas - rich galaxies with positive velocities ( i.e. there are no outgoing gas - rich galaxies ; only infalling galaxies can be gas - rich ) .",
    "examination of the other three panels indicates that the gas - rich galaxies tendency for negative velocities persists through the radial range @xmath59 ( top - right panel ) , then decreases between @xmath60 ( bottom - left panel ) , and finally disappears in the innermost radial range @xmath61 .",
    "note that @xmath62 corresponds to about @xmath63kpc , which is expected to be well resolved by our simulations .",
    "taken together , we conclude that gas - rich galaxies tend to enter the cluster in radial infalling orbits , and they continue to lose their gas until about @xmath62 ; within @xmath64 of the cluster center their velocities are  randomized \" and their gas has been lost .",
    "most gas - rich galaxies , once entering the cluster virial radius , do not come back out gas - rich with outgoing radial velocities at radii larger than @xmath62 .    figure  [ fig : cos ] shows histograms of gas - rich galaxies with respect to @xmath65 for four radial ranges at @xmath42 .",
    "the angle @xmath66 is measured between the velocity vector and the position vector of a given galaxy , thus @xmath67 corresponds to a velocity vector pointing exactly towards the center of the cluster , while @xmath68 corresponds to a velocity vector pointing away from the center of the cluster . in accord with the results shown in figure  [ fig : vr ] , we see that gas - rich galaxies tend to be infalling with @xmath65 close to @xmath69 , which is most clear in the radial range @xmath57 ( top - left panel ) , but still visible up to @xmath60 ( bottom - left panel ) . in the @xmath61 range ( bottom - right panel ) the distribution of gas rich galaxies",
    "has become symmetric .",
    "our conclusion that most gas - rich galaxies enter the cluster on radial infalling orbits ( figures [ fig : vr ] and [ fig : cos ] ) is supported by the 2-sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test results reported in table [ tab : table ] .",
    "we use the ks test to compute the probability that the distributions of gas - rich galaxies and the general population of galaxies as a function of @xmath70 and @xmath65 would appear as disparate as they are in our simulation if they were drawn from the same underlying parent distributions , for @xmath71 different cluster - centric radial ranges : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 . at cluster - centric distances",
    "greater than @xmath62 , the ks test yields very low p - values for both the distributions in radial velocities ( @xmath70 ) and velocity orientations ( @xmath76 ) . for instance",
    ", the ks test for the distributions of radial velocities ( figure [ fig : vr ] ) indicates that the hypothesis that the sample from the general galaxy population and the sample of gas - rich galaxies ( gas fraction @xmath77 ) have the same underlying parent distribution has a probability of @xmath78 for @xmath79 , @xmath80 for @xmath81 , and @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the ks test confirms that gas - rich galaxies on the outskirts of clusters fall in on radial orbits .",
    "the results presented in figure  [ fig : vr ] and figure  [ fig : cos ] are consistent with observations .",
    "for example , recent observations of 23 groups of galaxies by rasmussen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite find direct evidence for a suppressed star - formation rate in member galaxies out to scales of @xmath84 , in agreement with the simulations results described above .",
    "similar observations suggesting a suppressed star formation rate and/or increased gas depletion up to @xmath85 in clusters are presented by @xcite , and references therein .",
    "in addition , galaxies near the virial radius of the virgo cluster tend to have long one - sided h i tails pointing away from m87 @xcite , suggesting that these galaxies are falling in on radial trajectories ( see @xcite for a detailed analysis ) .",
    "similar results are observed for the coma cluster @xcite , where a @xmath86 kpc tail is seen in the member galaxy ngc @xmath87 suggesting ram - pressure stripping on radial infall of the galaxy on its first passage through the cluster .",
    "long tails of hi gas and ionized gas are also observed in the cluster abell 1367 , revealing galaxies in the process of being stripped - out of their gas @xcite .",

    ", there is no observed galaxy that has a gas tail pointing toward the center of a cluster .    observations also suggest that late - type galaxies have slightly more radial orbits than early - type galaxies @xcite , consistent with the results presented here .",
    "our results indicate that gas - bearing galaxies in clusters outside @xmath62 , should have been accreted within a time - frame that is shorter than the cluster dynamical time , because otherwise they would have lost their gas .",
    "this is consistent with the observational evidence in @xcite and with the gas - bearing early - type dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster @xcite .",

    "our conclusions are summarized below .",
