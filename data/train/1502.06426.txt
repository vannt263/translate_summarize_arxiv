    "@xcite identified a `` _ pre - brown dwarf _ '' , oph - b11 , and suggested that brown dwarfs can form in isolated cores as low mass stars @xcite . by comparing with evolutionary track from models , the low luminosities imply that vellos are substellar sources ( current mass @xmath8 0.08 @xmath9 ) embedded in molecular cores ( l1014-irs : young et al .",

    "@xcite suggested that the mass of l328 is at most 0.05 @xmath9 based on the estimate of mass loss rate from outflows .",

    "since vellos are usually isolated , they could be brown dwarfs forming through cloud fragmentation followed by gravitational collapse .",
    "on the other hand , vellos substellar masses also indicate that vellos can be early class 0 protostars or even younger than class 0 protostars ( iram 04191 : andr et al .",

    "@xcite showed that the n(n@xmath2d@xmath3)/n(n@xmath2h@xmath3 ) ratio decreases as the core evolves while getting hotter and less dense after the central protostar formed .",

    "this phenomenon explains that the models with high @xmath42 low @xmath43 , and low @xmath42 high @xmath43 are sometimes discriminated with difficulty . as a result",

    "our analysis provides the reference sensitivity which is required for constraining the physical conditions with radex .",
    "however , the analysis does not guarantee that the sensitivity allows to achieve the constraint as our example .",
