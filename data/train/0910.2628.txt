    "many liquids can form glasses if they are cooled rapidly , and glassy materials have technological applications such as optical fibers and plastics @xcite . the origin of the glass transition is still unclear , despite the scientific and technological interests .",
    "much work has examined the dynamical properties of materials near the glass transition .",
    "those studies revealed several important features of supercooled liquids and glasses .",
    "for example , upon approaching the glass transition , the structural relaxation time ( @xmath0 ) increases by several orders of magnitude without a corresponding growing static correlation length @xcite .",
    "the rate of this increase of @xmath0 is called `` fragility '' and depends on the material @xcite . for fragile glass - formers",
    ", @xmath0 steeply increases for a small decrease in temperature , while for `` strong '' glass - formers , the increase of @xmath0 requires a larger decrease in temperature .",
    "the relaxation time is related to the viscosity , and thus the fragility is an important factor in the ease of processing glass - forming materials .",
    "typically it is desirable to mold a glass - forming material with the viscosity held within a certain range ; for fragile materials , this may correspond to a restrictively narrow range of temperature .",
    "another common observation of materials close to the glass transition is that they often have a broad distribution of local mobility : some regions in a sample relax much faster than other regions .",
    "eventually , molecules in those regions exchange their dynamics , that is , fast regions become slow and vice versa .",
    "this is termed `` dynamical heterogeneity '' @xcite .",
    "it is known that the characteristic lifetime of these dynamically heterogeneous regions @xmath1 is longer than @xmath2 and the strong divergence of @xmath1 near a glass transition temperature suggests that heterogeneous dynamics are relevant for understanding the glass transition @xcite .",
    "a third common feature of materials in the glassy state is that their properties evolve with time , such as the diffusivity of molecules or dielectric susceptibility .",
    "this phenomenon is termed `` aging '' @xcite . despite the changing properties ,",
    "no clear structural changes have been seen ; this can be true even if , for example , diffusivity slows by several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "while all of these properties have been known for some time and carefully characterized by experiments , the origins of many of them are unclear . to understand the origins , numerical simulations with simple intermolecular interactions are used to study factors controlling the dynamics .",
    "these model systems are useful as clear understanding is hindered by the complexity of real materials @xcite .",
    "for the fragility , some simulations show that liquids become less fragile when the polydispersity increases ( or a larger size ratio for binary mixtures is used ) @xcite .",
    "this has been explained as due to ordering of the sample , which becomes frustrated in polydisperse samples .",
    "for example , in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems , small regions with hexagonal order can form which correspond with slower dynamics ( larger values of @xmath0 ) , and thus increasing the polydispersity frustrates formation of these ordered regions and diminishes the fragility @xcite . furthermore",
    ", it is reported that particle mobility in those ordered regions are slower than that in randomly structured regions and it suggests that dynamical heterogeneity is also influenced by local structure @xcite .",
    "those simulations used the polydispersity as a small perturbation frustrating the ordering , that is , with either a small polydispersity or a binary system with the particle size ratio close to 1 .",
    "however , dynamics in those situations are quite different from highly polydisperse samples .",
    "binary mixtures have two control parameters : the size ratio and the volume fraction ratio of the two components . these lead to complex phase diagrams @xcite and potentially emergent dynamical properties such as an effective depletion interaction between the large particles in binary hard sphere systems @xcite .",
    "our interest is in dense amorphous phases at intermediate size ratios .    in this article",
    ", we simulate the dynamics of binary soft disk mixture systems with large size ratios and find that the glass transition in large size ratio binary systems can be quite different from that of systems with smaller size differences .",
    "we study the fragility of binary soft disk mixtures with various size ratios and area fraction ratios .",
    "local ordering is less significant for large size ratio systems .",
    "instead , we see a molecular crowding effect from the large particles @xcite .",
    "our data suggest that the large particles act as confining walls for the smaller particles , and that confinement effects increase the fragility of such systems by suppressing dynamical heterogeneity .",
    "we also investigate aging in large size ratio systems , and again seen an influence of confinement effects due to the large particles .",
    "overall , our results suggest that confinement effects are crucial to describing the dynamics of the glass transition in binary mixtures with large size ratios between the two components .",
    "we perform two - dimensional brownian dynamics simulations for binary mixtures composed of large ( @xmath3 ) and small ( @xmath4 ) soft particles .",
    "these simulations are meant to mimic the colloidal glass transition . for the colloidal glass transition ,",
    "the key control parameter is the volume fraction @xcite , and so in our simulations the chief control parameter is the area fraction @xmath5 .",
    "the results of brownian dynamics simulations are similar to those of molecular dynamics simulations in dense systems @xcite .",
    "the particles interact via the purely repulsive weeks - chandler - andersen potential @xcite ; @xmath6 $ ] for @xmath7 , otherwise @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we fix @xmath11 , so the total area fraction @xmath5 is our control parameter to approach the glass transition .",
    "the mass ratio is @xmath12=@xmath13 and the length is normalized by @xmath14 .",
    "the total number of particles is @xmath15 ( or 4096 ) where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the number of large and small species , respectively .",
    "we generate initial conditions by simulating at @xmath18 for a long time and expanding the disk sizes to increase @xmath5 .",
    "we confirm that our results do not show initial condition dependence and our results are also independent on time below @xmath19 , that is , there is no aging observed .",
    "thus , we consider our binary systems are well mixed and ergodic for @xmath20 .    for certain area fractions for a 2d monodisperse sample , the hexatic order phase can be found , which has orientational order but no long - range positional order @xcite . for binary samples with large size ratios , there is apparently little ordering of either type , while for size ratios close to 1 , hexatic phases are still subtle to verify .",
    "hence , we calculate an orientation pair correlation function @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a normalized distance from a particle .",
    "@xmath21 decays with the power of @xmath23 in a hexatic phase for a monodisperse sample @xcite .",

    "do we observe large hexagonally ordered patches for our simulations , and the small patches that sometimes appear are transient .",

    "we can not rule out the existence of the depletion force in our simulations , which may affect the structure of the large particles , although at large area fractions the depletion force may be less relevant .",
    "indeed , we observe pairs of adjacent large particles which neighbors for long periods of time , but these neighbors separate eventually ( see movie  s1 , epaps materials to be submitted ) , and in general all of the dynamics are slow in our glassy experiments .",

    "crystals are also frustrated in our simulations with large size ratios , and in addition we find several new results .",
    "first , we have investigated fragility of binary systems .",
    "the fragility of binary systems with size ratios close to 1 ( @xmath69 ) is related to the growth of ordered regions : more fragile liquids show dramatic increases in hexagonal order as the glass transition is approached @xcite .",
    "however , systems with larger size ratios do not show this relation .",
    "both types of systems have fragilities which are related to the growth of a dynamical length scale @xmath50 , although the sign of this correlation is opposite for the small and large size ratio systems .",
    "the data show that in large size ratio systems , large particles act as quasi - immobile walls which confine the small particles and slow the dynamics overall .",
    "the large particles define regions with a range of sizes .",
    "small particles in large regions find it easier to move , even if within that region they may be adjacent to a large particle at the boundary of the region .",
    "small particles in smaller regions are much less mobile . in addition to these finite size effects , there are interfacial effects : small particles near large particles move slower than those farther away .",
    "those results are what is often seen in experiments and simulations of confined supercooled liquids . furthermore , as is often observed in simulations and experiments , we find some particles are unusually mobile .",
    "our new observation is that the length of time which these particles stay unusually mobile is connected to the lifetime of the confinement effect and thus the relaxation time of the large particles .",
    "finally , we also investigate aging dynamics in large size ratio systems .",
    "below the glass transition , the mobility decreases with respect to the waiting time , though we can not observe any structural change .",
    "we find that in `` younger '' systems that the motion of large particles is correlated with the motion of their neighbors , but that in `` older '' systems this correlation is markedly smaller . this correlation ( or lack of it ) relates to the confinement effect , suggesting that the large particles become more rigid confiners in older samples .",
    "it is important to note that simulations of softer particles with a charged ( yukawa ) potential find results different from ours , pointing out that our results are not completely generalizable . in simulations with a size ratio @xmath173",
    ", the large particles crystallized @xcite . in these cases , the large particles did not rearrange but rather moved on their lattice sites , and small particles could only move by diffusive hopping motions between the crystal interstices .",
    "this is in contrast to our simulations where the large particles are always able to rearrange ( albeit more slowly than the small particles ) .",
    "overall , our results suggest that in binary soft sphere systems , the effect of the large particles to induce finite size effects within the sample play an interesting role in the dynamics .",
    "two relevant variables are the finite sizes of regions between large particles , and the effective rigidity of the large particles . while our simulation studies 2d systems , the results are similar to prior observations in 3d binary colloidal experiments @xcite with moderate size ratios .",
    "while the effects are easiest to see with large size ratios , one implication of our simulations is that these effects may be relevant although less obvious in binary systems of smaller size ratios . indeed , one of the goals of our simulations was to understand the effect of structure by using systems where structural heterogeneity is more obvious .",

    "<S> we simulate binary soft disk systems in two dimensions , and investigate how the dynamics slow as the area fraction is increased toward the glass transition . </S>",
    "<S> the `` fragility '' quantifies how sensitively the relaxation time scale depends on the area fraction , and the fragility strongly depends on the composition of the mixture . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm prior results for mixtures of particles with similar sizes , where the ability to form small crystalline regions correlates with fragility . </S>",
    "<S> however , for mixtures with particle size ratios above 1.4 , we find that the fragility is not correlated with structural ordering , but rather with the spatial distribution of large particles . </S>",
    "<S> the large particles have slower motion than the small particles , and act as confining `` walls '' which slow the motion of nearby small particles . </S>",
    "<S> the rearrangement of these confining structures governs the lifetime of dynamical heterogeneity , that is , how long local regions exhibit anomalously fast or slow behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the confinement effect is correlated with the fragility and also influences the aging behavior of glassy systems . </S>"
