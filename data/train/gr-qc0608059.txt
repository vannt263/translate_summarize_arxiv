    "in the cyclic model of the evolution of the universe the cosmic singularity ( cs ) plays the key role because it joins each two consecutive classical phases .",
    "we propose the following basic criterion for the choice of the model of the neighborhood of the cs : reasonable model should allow for propagation of quantum p - brane ( i.e. , particle , string , membrane , ... ) from the pre - singularity to the post - singularity epoch .",
    "if the cs constitutes an insurmountable obstacle for quantum elementary objects , the cyclic evolution can not be realized .",
    "one of the simplest models of the neighborhood of the cs , inspired by string / m theory , is the compactified milne ( cm ) space .",
    "it was used recently @xcite in the cyclic universe scenario .",
    "we have already applied the above criterion for the propagation of a test particle across the cs of the cm space @xcite .",
    "the results we have obtained suggest that the cm space is a promising model deserving further investigation by making use of strings and membranes .    in this article",
    "we apply our criterion to the evolution of a test string in the cm space .",
    "we examine the propagation of a string in the so - called winding mode @xcite .",
    "it is defined to be a state in which a string is winding around the compact dimension undergoing contraction to a point followed by re - expansion .",
    "it turns out that the propagation is well defined both at classical and quantum levels .    in sec .",
    "ii we recall the classical formalism concerning the propagation of a test @xmath0-brane in a fixed background spacetime .",
    "classical evolution of the string in the winding mode is presented in sec .",
    "quantization of the dynamics is carried out in sec .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "the polyakov action for a test @xmath0-brane embedded in a fixed background spacetime with metric @xmath1 has the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a mass per unit @xmath0-volume , @xmath4 are @xmath0-brane worldvolume coordinates , @xmath5 is the @xmath0-brane worldvolume metric , @xmath6 $ ] , @xmath7 are the embedding functions of a @xmath0-brane , i.e. @xmath8 ) , in @xmath9 dimensional background spacetime .",
    "it has been found @xcite that the total hamiltonian , @xmath10 , corresponding to the action ( [ act ] ) is the following @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are any regular functions of @xmath0-volume coordinates , @xmath14\\approx 0,\\ ] ] @xmath15 and where @xmath16 are the canonical momenta corresponding to @xmath17 .",
    "equations ( [ conc ] ) and ( [ conci ] ) define the first - class constraints of the system .",
    "the hamilton equations @xcite are @xmath18 where the poisson bracket is defined by @xmath19",
    "in what follows we restrict our considerations to the compactified milne space .",
    "its metric is defined by the line element @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the minkowski metric , and @xmath22 parameterizes a circle to the segment @xmath23 gives a model of spacetime in the form of two orbifold planes which collide and re - emerge at @xmath24 .",
    "such model of spacetime was used in @xcite , but our results do not depend on the choice of topology of the compact dimension . ] .",
    "the spacetime with the metric ( [ line ] ) is singular at @xmath24 and it is not a coordinate choice singularity : one of its space dimensions ( denoted by @xmath25 ) disappears for a moment at @xmath24 leading to the degeneracy of the metric .",
    "it is a spacelike orbifold singularity ( see @xcite for more details ) .    in the paper",
    "we analyze the dynamics of a string in the _ zero - mode _ ( the lowest energy state ) which is _ winding _ around the @xmath22-dimension .",
    "the string in such a state is defined by the conditions @xmath26 which lead to @xmath27    the condition ( [ con1 ] ) reduces ( [ conc])-([pois ] ) to the form in which the canonical pair @xmath28 does not occur @xcite .",
    "thus , a string in the winding mode is described by ( [ conc])-([pois ] ) with @xmath29 replaced by @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , the propagation of a string ` reduces ' effectively to its evolution in the minkowski space with dimension @xmath31 , while @xmath9 was the original dimension of spacetime @xcite .    the constraint equations , ( [ conc ] ) and ( [ conci ] ) , for a string winding around the @xmath22-dimension reduce to the following form @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and the equations of motion ( [ hameq ] ) read @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is any regular function .",
    "it can be verified that in the gauge @xmath37 , the solutions are @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 where @xmath41 .    to analyze the propagation of a string across the singularity @xmath24",
    ", we eliminate @xmath42 from ( [ solp ] ) and ( [ solx ] ) . making the choice of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in such a way that @xmath45 leads to one - to - one relation between @xmath46 and @xmath42 .",
    "for instance , one may put @xmath47 that gives @xmath48 which can be rewritten as @xmath49 due to @xmath50 .",
    "the insertion of ( [ jaw ] ) into ( [ solx ] ) gives @xmath51 the solution ( [ sols ] ) is bounded and continuous at the singularity .",
    "thus , the classical dynamics of the zero - mode winding string is well defined in the cm space .",
    "in the gauge @xmath52 , the hamiltonian of a string is @xmath53 the quantum hamiltonian corresponding to ( [ ham1 ] ) has the form @xcite @xmath54 owing to @xmath55 .",
    "according to the dirac quantization method @xcite the physical states @xmath56 should first of all satisfy , due to ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ ham1 ] ) , the equation @xmath57 to solve ( [ eqs ] ) , we make the substitution @xmath58 which turns ( [ eqs ] ) into the following set of equations    @xmath59    @xmath60    where @xmath61 are the separation constants .",
    "two independent solutions to ( [ eqg ] ) have the form @xmath62 ( there is no summation in @xmath63 with respect to @xmath64 ) .",
    "two independent solutions of ( [ eqf ] ) read @xcite @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the hermite function and @xmath68 denotes the kummer confluent hypergeometric function .    in what follows we present the construction of a hilbert space , @xmath69 , of our system based on the solutions ( [ solg])-([solf2 ] ) :    first , we intend to redefine ( [ solf1 ] ) and ( [ solf2 ] ) to get _ bounded _ functions on @xmath70 $ ] , where @xmath71 $ ] denotes the ` time - like ' neighborhood of the singularity . for fixed value of @xmath72 and @xmath73 $ ] the solutions ( [ solf1 ] ) and ( [ solf2 ] )",
    "are bounded functions , as it is demonstrated by the plots of fig .",
    "( 1 ) .    for @xmath74 , the solution to ( [ eqf ] ) can be approximated by    @xmath75      second , we define the following generalized functions @xmath90 where @xmath91 and where @xmath92 .",
    "since @xmath93 are bounded , the functions @xmath94\\times { \\mathbb r}^{d-1})$ ] . equation ( [ hs ] ) includes ( [ solg ] ) due to the term @xmath95 , with @xmath96 .",
    "finally , we notice that ( [ hs ] ) defines the fourier transform of @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , according to the fourier transform theory ( see , e.q .",
    "@xcite ) the equation ( [ hs ] ) defines the mapping @xmath98   \\times { \\mathbb r}^{d-1})= : \\tilde{\\mathcal{h}}.\\ ] ] replacing @xmath99 by consecutive elements of an orthonormal basis in @xmath100 leads to an infinite countable set of vectors in @xmath101 .",
    "so obtained set of vectors can be rearranged into a set of independent vectors and further turned into an orthonormal basis by making use of the gram - schmidt procedure @xcite .",
    "one can show @xcite that the span of such an orthonormal basis , @xmath102 , is dense in @xmath101 .",
    "the completion of @xmath102 defines the hilbert space @xmath103 .    to illustrate the above construction ,",
    "let us use the hilbert space @xmath104 , where @xmath105 .",
    "let us take a countable infinite set of vectors @xmath106 defined as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the hermite polynomial .",
    "it is proved in @xcite that ( [ basis ] ) defines an orthonormal basis in @xmath109 .",
    "the basis ( [ basis ] ) can be used to construct a basis in @xmath100 .",
    "the basis is defined as the set of all vectors of the form @xmath110 .",
    "further steps of the procedure leading to the dense subspace @xmath102 are the same as described in the paragraph including eq .",
    "( [ plan ] ) .",
    "it is clear that ( [ hs ] ) , owing to the above construction , defines the solution to the equation @xmath111 .",
    "it is obvious that the hamiltonian ( [ qham1 ] ) is bounded from below ( and above ) and self - adjoint on the hilbert space @xmath69 .",
    "our results demonstrate that the dynamics of a _ test _ string winding around the compactified dimension in the _ zero - mode _ state is well defined . at the classical level",
    "there are no instabilities near the singularity ( characteristic for particle dynamics ) and our non - perturbative method of quantization leads to a non - singular quantum evolution of a string .",
    "a great challenge is examination of the dynamics of a _ physical _ string , i.e. a string that may change its state and modify the background spacetime during the evolution of the entire system .",
    "the issue of the backreaction has been intensively studied recently ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "calculations of the s - matrix amplitudes in time dependent singular orbifolds are plagued by infinities ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . however , there exist some attempts to cure the divergencies of scattering amplitudes ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it seems to us that such results only mean that in these type of orbifolds the string _",
    "theory breaks down and one should apply _ non - perturbative _ methods for analyses .    it is claimed in @xcite that the pessimistic results concerning the s - matrix can be confirmed by non - perturbative analyses .",
    "one shows in @xcite that , for instance , a single particle added to a time dependent singular orbifold causes the orbifold to collapse into a large black hole , which leads finally to the creation of a big - crunch that would not be followed by a big - bang .",
    "this result suggests that the compactified milne space is useless as a model of the neighbourhood of the cosmological singularity in the context of the cyclic universe scenario .",
    "it seems to us that the result of @xcite should be treated with caution .",
    "it is so because it was obtained by making use of general relativity , i.e. a classical theory , which is not suitable for _ complete _ understanding of the physics of a black hole .    in our article",
    "we have proposed a new non - perturbative method of analysis of the singularity of a time dependent orbifold .",
    "we believe that it can be further applied to analyses of the propagation of a winding string in _ non - zero _ modes ( excited states ) .",
    "it may initiate a new direction in a systematic examination of the backreaction phenomena in the context of time dependent orbifolds .",
    "we are conscious that _ real _ understanding of the problem would require quantization of the entire system , including string and orbifold , but it seems to be beyond the scope of the current stage of quantum gravity .",
