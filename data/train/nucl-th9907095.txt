    "antikaons have been proposed as a tool to probe in - medium effects in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the work of nelson and kaplan @xcite speculating about a strange condensate realignment in relativistic heavy ion collision by antikaons initiated numerous work in this field . indeed , coupled channel calculations for antikaons in matter @xcite demonstrate that the k@xmath1 feels an attractive potential in dense matter , which was confirmed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main effect stems from the @xmath2 resonance which is shifted upwards at finite density ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "also , data from kaonic atoms indicates that the k@xmath1 feels a sizable attraction inside the nucleus @xcite .",
    "more theoretical foundation for a reduced effective antikaon mass has been also given using chiral perturbation theory @xcite and mean - field models @xcite .",
    "this has triggered a considerable interest in the production of k@xmath1 in heavy - ion collisions at threshold .",
    "indeed , an enhanced production of k@xmath1 has been observed at gsi @xcite . this phenomenon has been attributed to a reduction of the antikaon effective mass in the dense medium @xcite .",
    "an attractive potential for antikaons has been extracted from kaonic atoms at zero momentum @xcite .",
    "however , heavy - ion collisions probe the optical potential of the antikaon at a finite momentum .",
    "assuming a temperature of @xmath3 mev @xcite , the antikaon has an average momentum of more than 300 mev with respect to the matter restframe .",
    "furthermore , all experimental data available so far cover only momenta above @xmath4 with respect to the matter rest frame .",
    "calculations have so far assumed that the attractive potential for the kaons i.e. their change in the mass is _ independent _ of momentum .",
    "this constitutes a considerable extrapolation .",
    "to which extend this is justified will be addressed in the present paper .",
    "based on a dynamical model for the k@xmath1nucleon interaction @xcite , we will argue that the antikaon optical potential in the momentum range relevant for heavy - ion collisions is likely to be small if not repulsive . only for the smallest momenta , which are considerably below the range covered by experiment",
    ", we find attraction which is compatible with fits to kaonic atoms .",
    "including the selfenergy of the kaon in a selfconsistent calculation we find that the optical potential at finite momentum is attractive but considerably reduced .",
    "thus it is appears unlikely , that the reduction of the antikaon mass is the underlying in - medium effect responsible for the enhanced k@xmath1 production rate .",
    "instead , we find that the in - medium cross section for producing antikaons via @xmath0 hyperons might be the relevant mechanism for the observed enhancement .",
    "there are indications from stopped k@xmath1 data on nuclei that there is indeed a change of the branching ratios in the nuclear medium @xcite supporting that picture .",
    "nevertheless , we also demonstrate that temperature effects are crucially important in the sense that they can wash out any in - medium effect .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we introduce the coupled channel approach in sect .  [",
    "sec : coupled ] and calculate medium effects for the kaon optical potential and cross section in sect .",
    "[ sec : coupled ] .",
    "effects of the nucleon and kaon selfenergy are studied in sect .",
    "[ sec : self ] .",
    "the in - medium effects for antikaons are included in a buu transport model in sect .",
    "[ sec : production ] and contrasted with experimental data .",
    "in the following we adopt the nonperturbative coupled channel approach of @xcite starting from the coupled channel schrdinger equation , @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the relative wave function , @xmath7 is the reduced mass , and @xmath8 is the momentum in the center of mass system for the corresponding channel . for a separable potential of the form @xmath9 the scattering @xmath10-matrix simplifies to @xmath11_{i , j}\\ .\\ ] ] the propagator matrix @xmath12 is diagonal and in the vacuum given by @xmath13 the coupling matrix @xmath14 is chosen to be of the standard @xmath15 flavor symmetric form .",
    "in addition to the previous approaches of @xcite , we include also the isospin one channels explicitly .",
    "for isospin zero , there are two channels @xmath16 whereas for the isospin one part , one has three channels which are coupled as @xmath17 the coupled channel calculation is performed for the two isospin channels separately .",
    "the scattering amplitude in a given isospin channel is then @xmath18 the cross section of a given channel is given by @xmath19 and is constructed out of the two isospin components of the @xmath10 matrix .",
    "the two parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be fixed either by the scattering amplitude as extracted by martin @xcite or by the threshold ratios as in @xcite @xmath22 we choose the former way as in @xcite and take over the parameters @xmath23 gev and @xmath24 .",
    "we note in passing , that this choice of parameters gives the threshold ratios @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . with a slight change of the coupling constant",
    ", i.e.  for @xmath28 , one gets the values @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 but the pole position of the @xmath2 is shifted then towards 1420 mev .",
    "this is consistent with the findings in @xcite , that one can either describe the scattering amplitude or the threshold ratios with a slight change of the coupling constant .",
    "we have verified that our results presented in the following are not sensitive to these small changes in the coupling constant @xmath21 .",
    "nuclear medium effects can be easily included .",
    "pauli blocking effects forbid intermediate nucleon states with a momentum less than the fermi momentum . hence , the propagator in the @xmath32 channel is modified in the medium to @xmath33 in both isospin channels . here , effects from a moving @xmath2 resonance is taken into account by the term proportional to the velocity of the resonance @xmath34 @xcite . for a kaon with finite momentum with respect to the nuclear matter rest frame",
    "the intermediate nucleon propagator will be shifted in momentum space .",
    "hence , the pauli blocking effect will be reduced in that case and the effects stemming from the @xmath2 resonance are moderated .",
    "the possibility for large range terms in the kaon - nucleon interaction , which might be important in the medium , has been raised in @xcite .",
    "fits to the k@xmath1-n scattering data using a coupled channel formalism find a good description without a range term @xcite .",
    "also in the model presented above ( without range terms ) one gets a good agreement with the scattering amplitude far below threshold @xcite .",
    "hence , we will not consider range terms in the following .",
    "antikaons produced in heavy - ion collisions will change their properties due to the surrounding nucleons .",
    "the antikaons produced in the first collisions will suffer rescattering processes from the in - streaming nucleons .",
    "the surrounding matter is not like bulk matter , it is more like a streaming matter with a high momentum .",
    "therefore , the optical potential relevant for the production of kaons even at subthreshold energies has to be considered at a finite momentum in the range of @xmath35 mev relative to the matter rest frame . in the following",
    "we denote this shift in momentum space of the colliding antikaon - nucleon pair ( with a given colliding energy @xmath36 ) with respect to the rest frame of the nuclear bulk matter in short form as the _ relative momentum_. figure [ fig : uopt_pkaon ] shows the optical potential of the kaon as defined as @xmath37 where we ignore recoil corrections .",
    "they are small @xcite and not relevant for the implementation into cascade models",
    ". for low relative momenta , the optical potential is getting more and more attractive as the density increases .",
    "this changes remarkably at higher relative momentum .",
    "the optical potential changes sign and gets repulsive again . especially for moderate densities , at normal nuclear density @xmath38 or less , the change happens at relative momenta not far from the fermi momentum of the nucleons . for higher relative momenta",
    ", the optical potential stays repulsive .",
    "hence , antikaon production is less favored at high relative momenta , on the contrary it is even slightly suppressed in the medium .",
    "pauli blocking effects of the propagator in the @xmath39 channel , eq .",
    "( [ eq : propmat ] ) , are responsible for switching the sign of the optical potential from repulsion at low density to attraction at high density ( this is due to the @xmath2 , see @xcite ) .",
    "this mechanism is not working at high relative momenta ( comparable to the fermi momenta of the nucleons ) , therefore resulting in a repulsive optical potential for the antikaons .",
    "for a higher density of @xmath40 and more the @xmath2 melts in the medium and an attractive potential is seen even for large relative momenta .",
    "therefore , one has to focus either on high density or on low to moderate density with small relative momentum to see the in - medium reduction of the antikaon mass in matter .",
    "inclusive observables in heavy - ion collisions are likely to probe regions of phase space where the antikaon feels both attractive and repulsive potentials so that in - medium effects are washed out",
    ". we will discuss these effects by making a detailed comparison with experiment in section [ sec : production ] .",
    "in the intermediate and final stage of the heavy - ion collision , the nuclear matter will be heated up .",
    "typical slope parameters are in the range of @xmath41 mev for the kaons at a bombarding energy of 1.8 agev @xcite .",
    "temperature effects can be implemented in our approach by replacing the @xmath42 function in the propagator ( [ eq : propmat ] ) with a fermi - distribution : @xmath43^{-1 } } { e - m_k - m_n - p^2/(2 \\mu_{kp } ) } \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the chemical potential which is fixed for a given density @xmath45 .",
    "again , pauli blocking effects will be weakened by a thermal smearing of the fermi sphere .",
    "indeed , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : uopt_temp ] , the optical potential for antikaons changes considerably for a finite temperature .",
    "at a temperature of @xmath41 mev , the optical potential has turned from attraction to repulsion for all cases shown up to a density of @xmath46 .",
    "the temperature at which the change of signs happens is rather low , especially for moderate densities . at normal nuclear density ,",
    "this critical temperature is around @xmath47 mev .",
    "usually , the optical potential for @xmath48 mev is used for describing the enhanced production of antikaons in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the optical potential is repulsive at very low densities up to @xmath49 due to the @xmath2 resonance . as the resonance mass",
    "is shifted up in dense matter ( see @xcite ) , the optical potential of the antikaons turns attractive for higher density .",
    "the switch in the sign of the optical potential from attraction to repulsion happens to occur at a much higher density , if the surrounding matter is moderately heated up .",
    "for a temperature of @xmath41 mev , this turning point is already shifted beyond @xmath40 .    while the optical potential is essentially zero for momenta relevant for heavy ion collisions",
    ", we find a considerable increase of the production cross section @xmath50 .",
    "figure [ fig : cross_enh2 ] shows this enhancement factor which we define as the ratio of the cross section at normal nuclear density and the vacuum cross section @xmath51 for the elastic reaction @xmath52 and the charge exchange reaction @xmath53 .",
    "both cross sections are enhanced tremendously .",
    "the elastic cross section is four times bigger already at threshold and increases up to a factor of 27 around an antikaon momentum close to the fermi momentum of the nucleons .",
    "the charge exchange reaction sets in at a finite antikaon ( @xmath54 ) momentum due to the mass difference of the charged and neutral antikaon .",
    "this cross section is even more enhanced in the medium than the elastic cross section signaling significant rescattering effects for the production of @xmath54 in the medium .    via detailed balance and by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross ] ) we calculate the production cross section of antikaons in the medium by @xmath55 .",
    "we expect that especially the channels involving @xmath0 hyperons will be enhanced in the medium as this channel enters into the isospin zero coupled channel .",
    "the main medium effects are resulting from the dynamics of the @xmath2 which changes the isospin zero part of the coupled channel calculation .",
    "the channel @xmath56 , which is isospin one , is then not changed significantly as evident from fig .  [",
    "fig : cross_enh ] .",
    "we note that the antikaon production cross section @xmath57 has increased by a large factor in matter .",
    "especially , the reaction @xmath58 is favored in dense matter compared to the other reactions at threshold .",
    "this results in a change of the branching ratio for nuclear targets , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we point out , that the present experimental data seems to support this medium effect for the reaction @xmath59 ( see @xcite ) . for higher antikaon momentum around 250 mev ,",
    "all three @xmath0 channels are enhanced by a factor of @xmath60 .",
    "the results presented here are not an artifact of our model used .",
    "one could argue that a chiral nonperturbative approach might alter the picture .",
    "also the @xmath61 channel contributions have to be taken into account , so that the matrices ( [ eq : couple ] ) and ( [ eq : couple2 ] ) have to extended correspondingly .",
    "moreover , especially concerning the pion dynamics , relativistic effects can be important .",
    "we have checked for all of these effects by using the recent chiral nonperturbative approach of oset and ramos @xcite which uses relativistic propagators and includes effects from the @xmath61 channels ( for a recent extension of their model see @xcite ) .",
    "the propagators are solved numerically by using a cauchy integrator .",
    "the separable potential originating from the lowest order chiral lagrangian term are now of the form @xmath62 and momentum dependent .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath10-matrix in the medium follows essential along the lines as described in section [ sec : coupled ] .",
    "the coupling matrix as well as the expression for the propagator and the cross section can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that this chiral approach provides a good description of the available vacuum scattering data . in the following ,",
    "we take the parameters of @xcite , @xmath63 and a cutoff of @xmath64 gev .",
    "we remark on passing that the threshold ratios in the isospin basis seems to be off but can be adjusted to the experimental data by a small change of the parameters . for a coupling constant of @xmath65 mev and a momentum cutoff of @xmath66 gev",
    ", we find the threshold ratios @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 which are in agreement with the data except for @xmath70 which turns out to be a little bit too small .",
    "as found for the non - relativistic case before , the position of the @xmath2 is shifted up towards 1.42 gev .",
    "medium effects are introduced in a similar fashion as discussed before .",
    "the resulting in - medium enhancement factor of the cross section is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_enh_rel ] in comparison to the nonrelativistic case .",
    "the @xmath71 channel is not as enhanced as the @xmath72 channels , but shows a rise in the chiral approach compared to the nonrelativistic approach .",
    "the @xmath73 production channel is enhanced at threshold even for this approach . also ,",
    "all three @xmath72 channels are drastically enhanced around an antikaon momentum of 250 mev by a factor between 2040 .",
    "these findings support the picture already seen in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "now , we turn to study effects of a finite relative momentum with respect to the matter rest frame and temperature in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "the enhancement factor for the production of k@xmath1 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_nr_pkaon ] at finite relative momentum and in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_nr_temp2 ] for finite temperature , respectively .",
    "both plots show the average cross section for producing a k@xmath1 via @xmath0 hyperons .",
    "similar to the optical potential the effect decreases at finite relative momentum .",
    "however , the cross section is still enhanced by a factor three at threshold even for a relative momentum of @xmath74 mev , where the optical potential of the antikaon is already repulsive ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : uopt_pkaon ] ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the cross section is even stronger as anticipated from our discussion about temperature effects for the antikaon optical potential .",
    "the peak structure vanishes already at a temperature of @xmath47 mev . still ,",
    "an enhancement factor of 23 remains at threshold even for the highest temperature shown ( @xmath41 mev ) for which the optical potential for the antikaon is repulsive throughout the density region of interest ( see fig.[fig : uopt_temp ] ) .",
    "a point of criticism can be raised in connection with the general approach .",
    "if the @xmath2 as a resonance melts in hot and dense matter what should remain is the mean - field potential due to the underlying antikaon - nucleon potential .",
    "this can be tested by e.g.  including an extra imaginary optical potential into the propagator which simulates collisions with surrounding nucleons .",
    "the potential is known from proton - nucleus scattering data to be about @xmath75 mev at @xmath38 ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "compared to the kaon optical potential inside the nucleus we expect a 10 % effect if we include the nucleon optical potential in the propagator ( [ eq : propmat ] ) .",
    "the enhancement seen in the cross section originates from the dynamics of the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "as we have demonstrated , it does not depend on the detail of the interaction .",
    "nevertheless , as recently shown by lutz @xcite , the @xmath2 does not move to higher energy , if the propagator is calculated selfconsistently by including the self - energy of the antikaons .",
    "the peak of the imaginary part of the isospin zero scattering amplitude is not shifted but gets broader in the medium .",
    "hence , strength is still transported from the off - shell energy towards threshold energy as the peak broadens . using the optical theorem",
    ", this means that the cross section will still be enhanced at threshold in the medium .",
    "the enhancement in the medium will be less pronounced as in our approach but we estimate from fig .  4 of @xcite that it will be still a factor of four or so enhanced compared to the vacuum .",
    "both selfenergies can be incorporated in our approach by modifying the propagator ( [ eq : propmat ] ) to @xmath76 where @xmath77 stands for the optical potential of the kaon which has to be calculated selfconsistently .",
    "note that the optical potential has now a real and an imaginary part , where the former part is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : uopt ] ) and the latter part correspondingly . the optical potential @xmath77 is calculated iteratively and then put into the propagator in the next step .",
    "this iteration scheme converges after 56 steps in agreement with the calculations in @xcite .",
    "we denote the results of this approach in the following as the selfconsistent ones .",
    "the effects of the nucleon and the antikaon optical potential on the real part of the antikaon optical potential are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : uopt_pkaon_comp ] .",
    "shown is the momentum dependence at normal nuclear density .",
    "our previous result without the implementation of any selfenergy for the nucleon or the antikaon is plotted in solid . at zero momentum , the optical potential changes by 10 % , as expected , when including the nucleon optical potential .",
    "the selfconsistent approach reduces the optical potential remarkably to @xmath78 mev in stark contrast to the standard values deduced from kaonic atoms @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the momentum dependence of the selfconsistently calculated optical potential is just flat .",
    "that means , that the optical potential does not turn repulsive anymore as it happens for the calculation with the free propagator .",
    "the nucleon optical potential also changes the momentum dependence considerably , so that the potential decreases but is still attractive at high momenta .",
    "this trend continues when applying values of @xmath79 mev : the optical potential saturates at @xmath80 mev at zero relative momentum and at @xmath81 mev at high relative momentum .",
    "note , that for all cases considered here , the optical potential is still substantially weakened at high momenta ( or even over the whole momentum range shown ) .",
    "we have also checked for a repulsive optical potential of the @xmath0 @xcite of @xmath82 mev at @xmath38 .",
    "choosing in addition @xmath83 mev and @xmath84 mev at @xmath38 , we find that the real part of the optical potential is reduced slightly by about 10% .",
    "we also checked possible effects from an effective nucleon mass as done in @xcite before . a nucleon mass shifted by @xmath85 mev at @xmath38",
    "does not alter significantly the position and shape of the @xmath2 compared to the shifted threshold and hence can be safely neglected .",
    "this result is in line with refs .",
    "@xcite where binding energy effects for hyperons and nucleons have been found to be small , too .",
    "we turn now again to the production cross section of k@xmath1 via hyperons , i.e.the enhancement factors when including the nucleon optical potential ( fig.[fig : cross_nnpot_enh ] ) and for the selfconsistent calculation ( fig.[fig : cross_nrselfc_enh ] ) .",
    "the nucleon optical potential reduces the overall enhancement factor by about a factor of two .",
    "the shapes are essentially the same as for the free propagator , fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_enh2 ] . for larger values of @xmath79 mev",
    "we find that the enhancement factors at the maximum are reduced down to @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "effects of hyperon and pion optical potentials reduce the maximum enhancement factors down to @xmath88 , i.e.  a repulsive @xmath0 potential still results in a sizable enhancement of the @xmath72 production cross section .",
    "the selfconsistent case shows a quite different behavior .",
    "the @xmath89 and the @xmath90 channels are enhanced at higher momenta of the outgoing antikaon while the @xmath73 channel increases especially at threshold up to a factor of 2.5 .",
    "compared to the calculation done in @xcite , a calculation using the chiral interaction terms provides a larger enhancement .",
    "we attribute this to the energy dependence of the chiral interaction term which will shift strength from lower to higher energies .",
    "in order to explore the observable consequences of the results above we have performed calculations of @xmath54 production in ni+ni collisions at 1.8 agev within a buu transport model that has been quite successfully applied to particle production in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies @xcite as well as pion @xcite and photon @xcite induced reactions . for a detailed description of the underlying formalism and the the non - strange part of the model we refer to refs .",

    "first , we note that our model gives a reasonable description of the experimental data on pion production and nucleonic observables in ni+ni collisions at 1.8 agev . in fig .",

    "we should mention that the calculations in @xcite obtain contributions to the spectrum for kaon center of mass energies below 50 mev for which the experimental acceptance vanishes .",
    "having shown that our model gives a fair description of total strangeness production we now turn to the investigation of observable consequences of the above described medium modifications for the antikaon . since the medium effects for the cross sections as well as the potential are most pronounced at zero temperature and momentum we first present results for which we neglect the temperature and momentum dependence and take all quantities at @xmath48 and @xmath136 in order to explore the maximum possible effects .",

    "one should note that the modification of the @xmath139 cross sections also gives an enhanced @xmath140 absorption . in fig .",
    "[ fig : buu2 ] we therefore show the number of @xmath141 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath142 ( solid lines ) collisions for the different scenarios .",
    "one sees that the modification of the cross sections enhances the @xmath140 production in @xmath143 collisions for invariant energies below 1.52 gev by about a factor of 3 .",
    "an inclusion of the potential leads to an increase of @xmath142 collisions by about a factor of two since more antikaons are overall produced , especially in baryon - baryon and pion - baryon collisions , while the @xmath140-production in @xmath143-collisions is only slightly enhanced . due to the attractive @xmath140-potential the @xmath36-distributions",
    "are shifted to lower energies . in the calculation with modified cross sections and potential the antikaon production in @xmath143-collisions below 1.52 gev",
    "is increased by more than a factor 5 compared to the case without any medium modifications . however , also the @xmath140 absorption is substantially increased .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : buu3 ] we present the results of calculations for which the momentum or temperature dependence in addition to the density dependence of the cross sections or potential were taken into account .",
    "now the medium effects on the @xmath54 yield completely disappear because  as discussed above  all modifications decrease with increasing momentum and temperature . using the temperature dependent @xmath54 potential from fig .",
    "[ fig : uopt_temp ] we even get a slight reduction of the @xmath54 yield because in the dynamical calculation of the heavy - ion collision the density - temperature correlations are such that the @xmath54 potential is almost always repulsive .",
    "one should note that a transport theoretical calculation of the total @xmath54 yield in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies is encumbered with substantial uncertainties with respect to the input of unknown elementary cross sections , like e.g. @xmath144 or @xmath145 . in this context",
    "we again mention that even strangeness production in proton - neutron collisions at the relevant energies has not yet experimentally been measured .",
    "therefore a determination of the @xmath54 potential from the total yield appears to be difficult . an observable which might not be sensitive to these uncertainties",
    "is @xmath54 flow .",
    "therefore , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : buu4 ] the influence of the different in - medium scenarios on transverse @xmath54 flow . the anti - flow which is present in the calculation without medium modifications ( solid line ) is hardly affected by the modification of the cross sections ( dashed line ) .",
    "the same also holds if one includes the temperature or momentum dependence .",
    "the attractive @xmath54 potential ( at @xmath146 ) ( dotted line ) is able to compensate this shadowing effect and gives a positive @xmath54 flow since now the antikaons follow the nucleons .",
    "an inclusion of the temperature dependence of the potential leads to a disappearance of this effect .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : buu5 ] we compare our calculations to the experimental data of the fopi collaboration @xcite for the @xmath147 ratio in @xmath148ru+@xmath148ru collisions at 1.69 agev . here",
    "we have applied the experimental acceptance cuts ( @xmath149 gev , @xmath150 , @xmath151 gev ) .",
    "one sees that already the calculation without medium modifications ( solid line ) gives a reasonable agreement with the experimental data although the calculated distribution seems to be slightly too flat .",
    "the calculation with modified cross sections ( at @xmath146 ) gives an enhancement of the @xmath147 ratio by about 50% in the measured phase space region and is also compatible with the experimental data .",
    "the attractive @xmath140-potential ( at @xmath146 ) ( dotted line ) leads to an pronounced increase of the ratio towards mid - rapidity .",
    "however , within the measured rapidity range also this scenario is hardly distinguishable from the one without medium modifications .",
    "we note that the theoretical calculation in the lowest rapidity bin around @xmath152 suffers from very low numerical statistics as the rapidity distributions are practically zero .",
    "the calculation with modified cross sections and potential ( dash - dotted line ) gives a rather flat distribution that overestimates the experimental data by about 50% .",
    "an inclusion of the temperature dependence again gives a result which is even slightly below the calculation without medium modifications .",
    "our results can be compared with refs .",
    "the calculation for @xmath54 production in ni+ni collisions at 1.8 agev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : buu1 ] ) without employing medium modifications agrees rather well with the respective calculation in ref .",
    "the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite gives a result that is a factor of 2 smaller .",
    "the effect of the attractive @xmath54 potential is weaker in our calculations than in @xcite . while in our calculations",
    "the @xmath54 yield at energies around 200 mev is only enhanced by about 50% , the calculations in @xcite and @xcite obtain factors of 2 and 3 , respectively .    in the calculation of the @xmath147 ratio in ru+ru collisions at 1.69 agev in ref .",
    "@xcite it appears that the experimental cuts have not been taken into account since there are contributions at midrapidity where the acceptance vanishes . without in -",
    "medium modifications this calculation is far below the data points @xcite while an attractive in - medium potential ( at zero relative momentum ) shifts the curve on top of the data points .",
    "we note that our calculation without experimental acceptance cut gives a ratio at midrapidity which is a factor of 3 - 4 larger than the calculation in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the optical potential for antikaons in the nuclear medium for finite relative momenta and finite temperatures .",
    "we find that the optical potential changes remarkably and turns repulsive at a relative momentum comparable to the nucleon fermi momentum and/or a finite temperature of a few tens of mev .",
    "the strong momentum dependence is reduced when the hadron selfenergies are taken into account selfconsistently but it results in a substantially shallower antikaon potential .",
    "hence , antikaons produced in the central region of an heavy - ion collision are likely to feel a substantially less attractive if not repulsive potential .",
    "therefore , it seems that contrary to previous assumptions the antikaon potential at zero temperature and momentum can not be reliably used to study in - medium effects in heavy - ion collisions .    on the other hand , we demonstrate that the cross section for producing antikaons via @xmath0 hyperons is considerably enhanced in the nuclear medium .",
    "this holds also for model calculations implementing chiral symmetry , relativistic propagators , optical potentials for nucleons or for a selfconsistent calculation of the antikaon selfenergy .",
    "the cross sections is always enhanced at threshold , especially for @xmath73 , even for finite relative momentum or finite temperature .",
    "we implemented the in - medium effects for the antikaons within a buu transport model .",
    "an enhancement of the antikaon production is seen for medium modified cross sections and a @xmath54 potential which follows more closely the experimental data than the calculation without any of those in - medium effects . including temperature effects , the in - medium enhancement vanishes and",
    "even turns to a suppression of @xmath54 due to the repulsive potential felt by the @xmath54 .",
    "let us finally stress again that the environment for antikaons is completely different in heavy - ion collisions compared to kaonic atoms _ and _ neutron stars where one probes the potential at zero momentum and zero temperature .",
    "it appears that the enhanced subthreshold production of @xmath54 is more subtle than hitherto assumed and deserves further study .",
    "clearly , we do not have a consistent picture to explain the enhancement seen experimentally .",
    "further work has to be done to address this problem as for example by studying in - medium effects using the chiral approach at finite momentum and temperature .",
    "future experimental data triggering on low momenta and/or the high density stage of heavy - ion collisions might help to elucidate the possible in - medium effects for antikaons in matter .",
