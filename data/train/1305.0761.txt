    "the luminosity distance - redshift relation obtained using type ia supernova provided the first clear evidence for an accelerating universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "further evidence , based on different types of observational data , has since become available ( @xcite ) .",
    "the acceleration of the expansion rate of the universe rapidly became one of the most intriguing problems in modern cosmology .",
    "since then , there have been many solutions proposed and some have survived the increasingly tight constraints imposed by observational data . among those solutions , which include changes to the left - hand side ( or the geometry / gravity part ) of einstein s field equations , as in modified gravity theories ( @xcite ) , or the introduction of extra spatial dimensions , as in braneworld models ( @xcite ) , one of the most popular assumes the existence of an exotic form of energy in the universe , characterized by a negative pressure , known as dark energy .",
    "if it exists , then present - day observations suggest it accounts for approximately @xmath2 per cent of the universe s total energy density , and its pressure - to - density ratio ( known as the equation of state , @xmath3 ) is nearly constant with time and close to @xmath4 ( @xcite ; see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "if future observations continue to point towards a value of @xmath3 near @xmath4 , then the hypothesis of the dark energy being in the form of a cosmological constant , @xmath5 , will gain strength , demanding for more insight on the theoretical problems raised by such a scenario ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "but it is also conceivable that observational data will become more easily reproducible with a value for @xmath3 close to , but not exactly equal to , @xmath4 , opening the door for alternative hypothesis , such as quintessence theories .    in quintessence theories ,",
    "the dark energy is assumed to be the result of a scalar field , @xmath6 , minimally coupled to ordinary matter through gravity .",
    "the field evolves in a potential @xmath7 with a canonical kinetic term in its lagrangian , which results in a dark energy equation of state @xmath8 , not necessarily constant .",
    "these models have already been extensively studied ( @xcite ) and , usually , it is assumed that the evolution of the scalar field is monotonic in a potential that satisfies the typical inflationary slow roll conditions ( see @xcite for a review on inflation ) , as given by : @xmath9 and @xmath10 under these conditions , the dark energy equation of state will always be close to @xmath4 , and the motion of the field becomes greatly simplified ( @xcite ) , allowing for an analytical expression for @xmath3 as a function of the scale factor @xmath11 .",
    "the motion of the field will also depend on the present - day values of @xmath3 and of the dark energy density , @xmath12 , where @xmath12 is the ratio of the dark energy density , @xmath13 , to the universe s critical density , @xmath14 .    however , the inflationary slow - roll conditions are sufficient but not strictly necessary in quintessence models .",
    "relaxing one of the conditions opens up the possibility of complex scalar field dynamics , allowing for a more dynamical evolution of the dark energy equation of state , while still being on average close to @xmath4 . in this paper",
    "we will be particularly interested in scalar field models where late - time oscillations in the expansion rate of the universe can arise due to non - standard scalar field dynamics .",
    "in particular , we will focus on two scalar field models for which such behavior is possible .",
    "model i assumes a quadratic potential , where an extra degree of freedom , related to the curvature of the potential at the extremum , is introduced on the evolution of the scalar field ( @xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , we consider the case where the curvature of the potential is such that it enables the field to oscillate around the stable extremum , a model already confronted with supernovae data ( @xcite ) . here",
    "we determine the evolution of its equation - of - state and study its impact on structure formation , forecasting the viability of the model against future euclid data .    in the case of model ii , we consider rapid oscillations in the equation - of - state , corresponding to an effectively constant equation of state when averaged over the oscillation period ( see @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "an oscillating equation - of - state is a way to solve the coincidence problem , removing the special character of the current accelerating phase , and of including the crossing of the phantom barrier @xmath15 .",
    "various phenomenological parameterizations of the amplitude , frequency and phase of the oscillations have been proposed ( @xcite ) , not necessarily arising from oscillations in quintessence models , and have been constrained mostly with background observables , except for @xcite where the impact on structure formation have been investigated . in our paper , the rapid oscillations are produced by a scalar field in a power - law potential where the minimum is zero .",
    "the field starts evolving monotonically , and only close to today it starts oscillating around the minimum , guaranteeing that the observed cosmic history is not significantly affected ( @xcite ) , and producing rapid oscillations in the equation - of - state .    in section 2",
    ", we review the dynamics of quintessence and present the models on which we focus our attention . in section 3 , we present the method and cosmological probes we will use to obtain the euclid forecasts presented in section 4 . we conclude in section 5 . throughout the paper",
    "we shall assume the metric signature @xmath16}}$ ] and natural units of @xmath17 .",
    "the action for quintessence ( see @xcite for a thorough review ) is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the ricci scalar , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are , respectively , the matter and scalar field lagrangians .",
    "the field s lagrangian takes the form @xmath22 where @xmath7 is the field s potential .",
    "we will be considering the line element for a flat , homogeneous and isotropic universe as given by the friedmann - roberston - walker ( frw ) metric .",
    "varying the field s individual action with respect to the metric elements @xmath23 , one can obtain the field s energy - momentum tensor elements , @xmath24 . from the latter , the quintessence equation of state , defined as the ratio between the dark energy pressure , @xmath25 , and energy density , @xmath13 ,",
    "is given by    @xmath26    this equation shows that , in order to have a dark energy equation of state close to @xmath4 , the field s evolution has to be potential dominated , such that @xmath27 .",
    "this is why , generically , quintessence models are associated to scalar fields slowly evolving in the respective potentials .",
    "this can be ensured , for instance , by the slow - roll conditions given by equations ( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) .",
    "the scalar field equation of motion is given by the euler - lagrange equation @xmath28 through this equation we can see that the field will evolve in the potential @xmath7 rolling towards a minimum in the quintessence potential , while its motion is damped by the presence of the hubble parameter , @xmath29 .",
    "considering a flat universe , with the frw metric , the hubble parameter , as a function of the scale factor @xmath11 , is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the universe s total energy density .",
    "we will be considering a universe consisting of pressureless matter and a scalar field playing the role of dark energy .",
    "this implies that @xmath32 . as a function of the scale factor , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the present - day value of the matter density ; the field s energy density will be given by @xmath35 . in a flat universe ,",
    "the present - day value of the matter energy density is determined by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the ratios of the present - day values of the matter and dark energy densities to the critical density , @xmath14 .",
    "the first model we consider is that of a scalar field rolling close to a stable non - zero minimum of its potential .",
    "the field is assumed to evolve in a potential that satisfies the slow - roll condition of equation ( [ s1 ] ) , while the other slow - roll condition is somewhat relaxed since @xmath39 can be large , namely as a result of the curvature at the potential s minimum .",
    "this model was extensively studied by @xcite , where a set of solutions for the evolution of the field was derived , as well as the respective equation of state , @xmath40 , as a function of the scale factor @xmath11 .",
    "these solutions are applicable to a wide array of potentials with non - zero minima , and depend on the present - day values of @xmath3 and @xmath12 , and on the curvature of the potential at the minimum , controlled by the parameter @xmath41 .",
    "the latter is given by equation @xmath42 in @xcite , which we reproduce here : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , each prime representing a derivative with respect to the scalar field , and @xmath45 are , respectively , the curvature and potential values at the minimum of the potential , @xmath46 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the present - day value of the dark energy density , @xmath47 . for this model",
    "we have @xmath48 , which means that @xmath49 .    in the case of @xmath50 , the behavior of @xmath40 is oscillatory , and can be analytically approximated through a combination of sinusoidal functions ( @xcite ) . for this to happen , we need to have @xmath51 , requiring the potential to be significantly curved at its minimum . in our analysis",
    "we do not use the analytical approximation for @xmath40 derived by @xcite , but instead calculate @xmath3 directly from equation ( [ eqstate ] ) by numerically solving equation ( [ eqmotion ] ) as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "the solution depends on three parameters : @xmath38 , @xmath41 and the initial value for the field , @xmath52 .",
    "the field s initial velocity , @xmath53 is assumed to be zero , which determines the initial value of the equation of state to be @xmath4 .",
    "we assume a quadratic potential , such that @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the curvature at the minimum , determined by @xmath56 . for models with large negative values of the curvature parameter @xmath41 ,",
    "the curvature of the potential at the minimum is larger , and the field is able to significantly overcome the hubble friction term and cross the potential s minimum , oscillating around it with decreasing amplitude .",
    "this produces a more dynamical behavior for @xmath3 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ w1 ] , exhibiting damped oscillations with local maxima located between points where the field s motion comes to a halt .",
    "for lower absolute values of @xmath41 , @xmath3 exhibits a less dynamical behaviour , evolving monotonically in the case @xmath57 .",
    "we note that if @xmath58,no oscillations occur , regardless the values of the other parameters , and the field effectively behaves as a cosmological constant .",
    "the second model we consider is that of a scalar field oscillating around zero , with a potential of the form ( @xcite ) @xmath59}}.\\ ] ] this potential is very flat for small field values and acquires a quadratic form for large field values .",
    "the scale @xmath60 determines the curvature of the potential at the minimum , @xmath61 , whereas the scale @xmath62 determines where the potential changes shape and enters the quadratic region , where the field will eventually oscillate .",
    "this model allows , if certain conditions are met , to have a field slowly - rolling until recently and then present some oscillatory behavior close to the present .",
    "it has been show that for a power - law potential , @xmath63 , one obtains @xmath64 when averaged over the oscillation period , @xmath65 , as long as it is much smaller than the hubble time , i.e. , @xmath66 ( @xcite ) . therefore ,",
    "in the oscillatory region ( @xmath67 ) of the potential being considered , @xmath3 should average to zero , because we then effectively have @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath69 .",
    "this means the scalar field would behave like pressureless matter , which goes against the need for having a negative pressure component to drive the cosmic acceleration .",
    "however , this model can be fine - tuned so that the oscillatory region of the potential is reached close enough to the present in order for the predicted large - scale dynamics of the universe not deviate much from that expected in a model where it is the presence of a cosmological constant that makes the universe accelerate . this",
    "fine - tuning can be achieved if the parameters of the model being considered take values around @xmath70 , @xmath71 , with @xmath72 being the present - day value of the hubble parameter , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the initial value of the field ( @xcite ) . in this particular realization of model ii ,",
    "the oscillatory behavior only starts around @xmath76 , avoiding the appearance of the gravitational instabilities that @xcite have shown to be a problem for early rapidly oscillating models with a negative averaged equation of state .",
    "we add that the frequency of oscillations in @xmath40 is much larger in model ii than in model i , as shown in fig .",
    "we note that a model with a higher @xmath62 enters the quadratic region of the potential sooner and thus the oscillations would start earlier , while an increase of @xmath52 has the opposite effect .",
    "however , in fig . [ w2 ] the model with higher @xmath62 is the one where the oscillations start later .",
    "this steems from the fact that we keep the ratio @xmath77 fixed in our analysis , and shows that the effect of @xmath52 is the dominating one .",
    "euclid is a space mission scheduled to be launched by the european space agency in @xmath78 .",
    "its main objective is to help better constrain the large - scale geometry of the universe and nature of the dark energy and dark matter components of the universe . in particular",
    ", euclid aims to measure the dark energy parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 accuracy , respectively ( @xcite ) , and will be able to constrain a large variety of dark energy models ( @xcite ) . to achieve its core scientific objectives , euclid will use the information contained in the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) present in the matter power spectrum and in the weak lensing ( wl ) features of the large - scale distribution of matter , acquiring spectroscopic and photometric data .",
    "the formation of acoustic waves in the primordial photon - baryon plasma , in the early stages of our universe , is imprinted in the form of a series of peaks in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) and in the large - scale distribution of matter ( bao ) .",
    "it presents a characteristic scale , the sound horizon at recombination , @xmath83 , which can be accurately measured using present cmb data , such as that acquired by wmap ( @xcite ) .",
    "its identification , both in the transverse , @xmath84 , and radial , @xmath85 , directions using the galaxy power spectrum , then allows the comoving distance , @xmath86 , and the hubble parameter , @xmath87 , as a function of redshift , to be constrained , given that ( @xcite ) as @xmath88 and @xmath89    in order to constrain the two quintessence models with euclid s spectroscopic survey , we will use the icosmo software package ( @xcite ) .",
    "we first compute @xmath84 and @xmath85 given the models equations - of - state and then compute the fisher matrix .",
    "the inverse of the fisher matrix contains lower limits for the errors of the estimated values for the models parameters , according to the cramer - rao theorem ( @xcite ) .",

    "we note that icosmo uses the analytical approximation of @xcite to evaluate the expected accuracy of an experiment s measurement of the bao scales .",

    "the magnitude of the lensing signal , measured in shear correlation functions , depends both on the amount of matter along the line of sight , and on the distances between the observer , the lens and the source .",
    "this makes weak lensing ideal for measuring the universe s mass distribution and geometry and , therefore , for constraining cosmological parameters , such as those that can be used to characterize the dark energy .",

    "<S> euclid is a future space - based mission that will constrain dark energy with unprecedented accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> its photometric component is optimized for weak lensing studies , while the spectroscopic component is designed for baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we use the fisher matrix formalism to make forecasts on two quintessence dark energy models with a dynamical equation of state that leads to late - time oscillations in the expansion rate of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we find that weak lensing will place much stronger constraints than the bao , being able to discriminate between oscillating models by measuring the relevant parameters to @xmath0 precisions of 5 to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the tight constraints suggest that euclid data could identify even quite small late - time oscillations in the expansion rate of the universe .    </S>",
