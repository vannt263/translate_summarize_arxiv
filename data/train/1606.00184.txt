    "in the standard @xmath9cdm cosmology , dark matter halos grow hierarchically over cosmic time through mergers of smaller halos .",

    ", galaxies are believed to be strongly influenced by the hierarchical clustering of their host halos .",
    "merging and accretion can trigger or regulate star formation , radiative cooling , supernova feedback , and chemical enrichment in galaxies .",
    "frequent merger events of dark matter halos may leave fossilized evidence of the star formation history of galaxies . therefore ,",
    "if one has detailed information on the mass history of a halo , one can better understand the internal properties and evolutions of the galaxies associated with the halo .    among the various tools for studying galaxy formation",
    ", the hydrodynamical simulation describes the evolution of the baryonic content of galaxies by using the gas dynamics as well as gravity and astrophysical processes @xcite .",
    "however , to include sub - galactic hydrodynamic processes in a volume sufficiently large enough to reduce cosmic variance , simulations should cover wide ranges of mass and length scales , which require excessive computational power and complex parallel computing techniques .",
    "moreover , it requires details on baryonic physics , such as star formation , radiative cooling , supernovae feedback , and initial stellar mass function , which are not well - known .    the semi - analytic model ( sam ) , on the other hand , places galaxies at the position of the most bound member particles ( mbps ) of simulated halos and subhalos . to determine the various properties of each mock galaxy ( e.g. , luminosity , color , and star formation activity ) ,",
    "the sam applies analytic prescriptions applied to the numerically found merging histories of host halos .",
    "however , the prescription parameters vary throughout literature , depending on which sets of prescriptions and observables are adopted to tune the parameters @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the semi - analytic recipes become more complicated as the number of target observables increases .",
    "alternatively , two types of approaches have been proposed to populate simulated halo galaxies while neglecting the details of the physics of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the halo occupation distribution does not try to identify and characterize individual mock galaxies in simulations .",
    "instead , it aims to find the conditional probabilities of various galactic properties ( e.g. , luminosity , spatial distribution , and number density of satellites ) for a given halo mass @xcite",
    ". the conditional probabilities could be measured from observations @xcite or from numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the subhalo - galaxy correspondence model assumes that each subhalo hosts only one galaxy @xcite .",
    "physical properties of galaxies can be assigned to subhalos if one assumes a monotonic relationship between the subhalo and galaxy properties such as mass / luminosity or size .",
    "however , it has been reported that such monotonic relationship may not properly work in cluster regions , where subhalos suffer from more tidal disruption than their embedded galaxies @xcite .",
    "recent studies have claimed that one can avoid the above problem by adopting the infalling mass of a dark matter subhalo rather than its ongoing mass @xcite . to know the infalling mass , one should have the mass history of a subhalo , which encounters the following issues : ( 1 ) because the ( sub)halo merger history may be measured differently for different merger tree implementations , the physical properties of simulated galaxies may not be unique @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) most merger models adopt sophisticated merger - identification algorithms that require the history of all member particles .",
    "therefore , it may be difficult to apply those models to massive cosmological simulations with more than billions of subhalos .",
    "( 3 ) subhalo finding may not work in a low simulation resolution .",
    "also , the infalling mass may vary depending on the subhalo - finding algorithms .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce an mbp - galaxy correspondence scheme that applies the modeled merger timescales to the fate of mbps .",
    "we develop our method with the following motivations : ( 1 ) mbps have been widely used in sams as one of the most reasonable proxies for galaxies @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) mbps enable us to build merger trees in a simple and computationally cheap way .",
    "( 3 ) unlike traditional methods , our method can find `` orphan galaxies , '' which have survived even after their host subhalos are disrupted @xcite . ( 4 ) our method can be useful even in @xmath0-body simulations with relatively low spatial and mass resolutions , where subhalo findings tend to have poor performances .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : numerics ] , we describe the details of our @xmath0-body simulation data , one - to - one correspondence model , and several models of the merger timescale . in section  [ sec : results ] , we study the properties of our mock galaxy samples , such as the survival probability of satellite galaxies , galaxy group properties , and two - point correlation functions ( 2pcfs ) .",
    "we also compare the properties of our mock galaxies with those of sdss galaxies .",

    "we identify halos from simulation data by using the friend - of - friend ( fof ) method with a common choice of linking length @xmath35 .",
    "the minimum number of member particles of a halo is set to 30 , which leads to a minimum halo mass of @xmath36 .",
    "we trace merger trajectories of identified halos at 75 time steps between @xmath37 and 0 , with a step size nearly equal to the dynamical timescale of the milky - way - sized galaxy . a halo ( hereafter @xmath38 )",
    "is called an ancestor to another halo ( hereafter @xmath39 ) found in the next time step if the mbp of @xmath38 is a member particle of @xmath39 .",
    "when a merger occurs , we call the mbp of the largest ancestor the host mbp of the merger remnant , while we called the other satellites mbps .",
    "we tag host and satellite mbps with the ongoing masses and the infalling masses of their host halos , respectively .",
    "we monitor the evolution of all mbps inside halos until @xmath40 .",
    "it should be noted that our merger tree of mbps does not directly contain proper information on tidal disruptions . although we may implement the concept of orphan galaxies on the merger trees",
    ", we may need a model on the lifetime of satellites in a cluster environment .",
    "also , our merger tree does not distinguish merger or accretion from the fly - by interactions of halos .",
    "figure  [ fig : scheme ] depicts the mbp - galaxy correspondence scheme applied to the 4 simulation data .",
    "we mark all mbps recorded in merger trees as galaxy proxies .",
    "the mass , position , and velocity tagged to each mbp are used to model the galaxy luminosity , position , and velocity , respectively .",
    "luminosity is assigned to each mock galaxy using the abundance matching between the mass function of mock galaxies and the luminosity function of the sdss main galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , because of the limitation of our merger trees described in the previous section , we need to calculate the survival time of a satellite galaxy . also , we need to distinguish between an actual merger event and a fly - by event in a reasonable way .    since galaxies are compact and gravitationally bound , one could expect that satellites would survive until they reach the centers of their host halos , where satellites merge into the central galaxy .",
    "therefore , we define the survival time of a satellite galaxy as the merger timescale of its host halo ( @xmath41 ) . after complete tidal disruption , we terminate the tree link of the mbp . in this paper , we test several theoretical models of the merger timescale proposed in the literature .    to differentiate between fly - bys and mergers , we use the following two - step process .",
    "first , when we identify a merger candidate , we check whether a satellite mbp is gravitationally bound to its host .",
    "if the total energy is positive , namely , if the satellite is not bound , this merger candidate is dropped as a fly - by .",
    "once a satellite is gravitationally bound to a halo at @xmath42 , we check whether it remains as the satellite until @xmath43 .",
    "if a satellite escapes before the estimated merger timescale , we check whether the escape is temporary or permanent .",
    "to check it we use a dynamical timescale , @xmath44 which is an orbital period around an object with a radius ( @xmath45 ) and circular velocity ( @xmath46 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . here , @xmath47 is the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the mean density of a virialized object in a unit of the critical density at redshift @xmath48 . if an escaped satellite returns to its host within a dynamical timescale , we consider the escape being incidental .",
    "if not , we mark the satellite as completely detached .    due to the hierarchical clustering in the @xmath9cdm cosmology , a host halo with ( a ) satellite(s ) may become a satellite to a bigger halo . in this case , a single satellite mbp would have multiple host halos through its merger history , and it may be unclear which host halo should be applied to measure the merger timescale of the satellite . in this paper , we assume that a satellite might be more affected by its closest host halo , or , the host halo of its earliest merger event . for this reason , our reference model uses the host halo of the earliest merger event of a satellite to calculate @xmath41 .",
    "we also tried another model that uses the minimum merger timescale updated at every time step and compared the results with those of the reference model , though we found no significant statistical difference between the results of the two models .",
