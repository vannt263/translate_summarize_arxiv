    "the bjorken sum rule  @xcite relates an integral over the spin distributions of quarks inside the nucleon to its axial charge .",
    "this relation has been essential for understanding the nucleon spin structure and establishing , _ via _ its @xmath6-dependence , that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) describes the strong force when spin is included .",
    "the bjorken integral has been measured in polarized deep inelastic lepton scattering ( dis ) at slac , cern and desy  @xcite-@xcite and at moderate four - momentum transfer squared @xmath6 at jefferson lab ( jlab )  @xcite , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "the variable @xmath6 is inversely related to the space - time scale at which the nucleon is probed . in the perturbative qcd ( pqcd )",
    "domain ( high @xmath6 ) the sum rule reads  @xcite : @xmath7 + \\sum_{i=2}^{\\infty}{\\frac{\\mu_{2i}^{p - n}(q^{2})}{q^{2i-2 } } } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the spin - dependent proton and neutron structure functions , @xmath10 is the nucleon axial charge that controls the strength of neutron @xmath11-decay , @xmath12 is the strong coupling strength and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the energy transfer and @xmath15 the nucleon mass .",
    "the bracket term ( @xmath16 , known as the leading twist term ) is mildly dependent on @xmath6 due to pqcd soft gluon radiation .",
    "the other term contains non - perturbative power corrections ( higher twists ) .",
    "these are quark and gluon correlations that need to be understood to describe the nucleon structure away from the large @xmath6 limit .",
    "the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath17 is calculable in principle from pqcd . in practice",
    ", this has been done for @xmath16 and @xmath18 only  @xcite . we stress that , as is almost always the case with pqcd , although the @xmath3-dependences are known , the absolute values of @xmath16 and @xmath18 are unknown and need to be measured or computed by non - perturbative means . besides its contribution to establishing pqcd ( at high @xmath6 )",
    ", the bjorken sum rule can be used to extract higher twists , to check lattice qcd calculations ( at moderate @xmath6 ) , and to test effective theories of the strong force ( at low @xmath6 ) . in addition",
    ", bjorken sum data and phenomenological models at lower @xmath6 can be described with a nearly constant `` effective strong coupling '' @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the lack of @xmath6-dependence of @xmath19 opens new avenues for non - perturbative qcd calculations using the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "the elastic contribution to the bjorken sum is usually not included because the generalized bjorken sum rule is derived at large @xmath6 where such contribution is negligible .",
    "furthermore , the bjorken sum rule naturally connects to the gerasimov - drell - hearn sum rule  @xcite in which the elastic is inexistent .",
    "consequently , when presenting the experimental measurement of the bjorken sum , the elastic contribution will not be included .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion on whether to include or not the elastic contribution to the gdh sum rule .",
    "however , for higher twist analysis , all reactions should be included for a meaningful higher twist extraction  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "therefore , in the part of the paper discussing higher twist extraction , the elastic contribution to the bjorken sum will be added .    in this paper , new data from the jlab clas",
    "eg1b experiment  @xcite-@xcite taken on polarized proton and deuteron targets are used to extract the bjorken integral over an extended @xmath3 range : @xmath20 gev@xmath1 compared to the previous jlab range @xmath21 gev@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the extension down to @xmath22 gev@xmath1 allows us to compare to chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath23 ) calculations in a domain where the chiral approximation should be valid .",
    "the moderate @xmath3 range had been precisely measured  @xcite .",
    "the new data set , of equivalent precision , provides a useful check .",
    "in particular , it verifies the neutron results , which come mostly from @xmath24he in ref .",
    "@xcite and from the deuteron in this paper . at larger @xmath3 ( @xmath25 1 gev@xmath1 , where eq .",
    "[ eq : bj(q2 ) ] holds ) , higher twists can now be studied with a statistical precision typically improved by a factor of 2 .",
    "previous work  @xcite has shown the necessity of precise @xmath3 mapping at moderate @xmath3 ( @xmath25 1 gev@xmath1 ) because of the surprisingly small size of the overall higher twist effect .",
    "one might be tempted to lower the @xmath3 values at which the analysis is done ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : bj(q2 ) ] ) but this is not reliable due to the fast @xmath26 rise of twist @xmath27 contributions at low @xmath3 and to the increasing uncertainty of the evolution of the twist-2 parts . the main contributor at low @xmath6 to this uncertainty is the strong coupling constant @xmath12 .",
    "the bjorken integral is advantageous compared to the individual moments @xmath28 and @xmath29 because of simplifications arising from its non - singlet ( p - n ) nature : at moderate @xmath6 lattice qcd calculations are easier and more reliable because disconnected diagrams , which can not be easily computed on the lattice , cancel out . at higher",
    "@xmath6 , the ( p - n ) simplification provides a sum rule ( the bjorken sum rule ) based on more solid grounds than the sum rules for individual nucleons ( the ellis jaffe sum rules  @xcite that necessitate additional assumptions ) . at low @xmath6 ,",
    "the ( p - n ) subtraction cancels the @xmath30 resonance contribution which makes the @xmath23 calculations significantly more reliable  @xcite . by a similar argument",
    ", the transverse - longitudinal polarizability @xmath31  @xcite , a higher moment of spin structure functions , also provides a reliable test of @xmath23 computations .",
    "( in that case , the @xmath30 contribution is suppressed at low @xmath6 because the n-@xmath32 transition is mostly transverse , making the longitudinal - transverse ( lt ) interference term very small . ) nevertheless , calculations based on @xmath23 and data for @xmath31 on the neutron  @xcite strongly disagree .",
    "this calls for more low @xmath6 studies , especially the yet unmeasured @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "the data discussed in this paper were taken with a longitudinally polarized target and hence can not be used to extract @xmath34 .",
    "however , the generalized forward spin polarizability @xmath5 can be obtained and , just like the bjorken integral , its isovector part @xmath35 offers the same advantages as @xmath31 for checking the calculation techniques of @xmath23 .",
    "we will also report on these results .",
    "the measurements of structure functions @xmath8 and @xmath36 are described in refs .",
    "the data cover an invariant mass range up to @xmath37 3 gev for 0.054 @xmath38 2.92 gev@xmath4 .",
    "since experimental moments are integrated over a finite @xmath39 range , the data have to be supplemented by models for large @xmath39 .",
    "we used the model described in ref .  @xcite down to @xmath40 .",
    "this part is known from dis experiments .",
    "the rest is determined using a regge parametrization  @xcite which was compared to that of bass and brisudova  @xcite and found consistent with it .",
    "a parameterization was also used to estimate the contributions between pion threshold ( 1.08 gev ) and 1.15 gev  @xcite .",
    "the bjorken integral is obtained from @xmath41 and @xmath42 assuming : @xmath43 with the deuteron d - state probability @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "the data are given in table i ( a more detailed table is given in  @xcite ) and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bjsr ] . the elastic contribution ( @xmath45 )",

    "the bjorken integral was extracted from polarized proton and deuteron data for @xmath55 gev@xmath4 . the results for intermediate @xmath3",
    "( the parton to hadron transition domain ) are consistent with previous jlab data in which the neutron information was extracted from polarized @xmath56he .",
    "this region exhibits a strong @xmath3-behavior , both from pqcd evolution and from some higher - twist effects . on the other hand , in the high-@xmath6 domain the bjorken integral",
    "is rather flat .",
    "the data together with kinematic constraints at @xmath57 also suggest a small @xmath6-dependence , in qualitative agreement with the generalized gdh sum predictions .    at the lowest @xmath6 accessed by our data ,",
    "@xmath23 calculations agree better with the bjorken integral ( an isovector quantity in which the @xmath30 resonance does not contribute ) than with moments on individual nucleons .",
    "this is not trivial since the @xmath23 calculations fail to describe the generalized spin polarizability @xmath31 in which the @xmath30 is also suppressed .",
    "it is clear from previously published data on @xmath31 and our analysis of @xmath5 that the @xmath30 resonance contribution is not responsible for the discrepancy between data and calculations .",
    "the discrepancy between the @xmath23 calculations and the data occurs in all isospin channels , which makes it less likely that it is due to the contribution from heavier mesons in the chiral expansion .",
    "the low @xmath6 @xmath23 regime has been recently mapped by two additional dedicated experiments in clas using polarized proton  @xcite and deuteron targets  @xcite and one in hall a using polarized @xmath56he  @xcite .",
    "these experiments will provide further precision tests of @xmath23 calculation techniques .",
    "the moderate @xmath3 data ( 1 to 3 gev@xmath1 ) allow us to extract higher twist contributions and color polarizabilities . the twist-4 coefficient was found to be large : @xmath59 at @xmath60 gev@xmath4 ( compare to @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath64 remains relatively large ( @xmath65 ) ; however , we have completed several systematic studies both with the existing data as well as simulated data ( with no statistic fluctuations ) that indicate our result is stable .",
    "the sign and magnitude of @xmath2 agree with a recent analysis performed on @xmath66 directly  @xcite .",
    "the observation that higher twist effects on @xmath67 are small overall does not imply that the net higher twist effect on the structure function @xmath68 is small at any @xmath50 .",
    "it is important to study the @xmath50-dependence of the higher twists , as is done in ref .",
    "@xcite . that @xmath69 is significantly larger than @xmath70 , and that @xmath71 , agrees well with the prediction of the two - scale model  @xcite .",
    "overall the net effect of higher twists is small , because of a cancellation between the twist 4 and twist 6 terms that are of similar sizes but opposite signs .",
    "this trend has also been seen for higher twist analyses done on the unpolarized structure function @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted within a vector dominance framework : the oscillating signs arise from the development in series of the vector meson propagator @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the meson mass .",
