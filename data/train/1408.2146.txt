    "the physics of compton scattering in strong magnetic fields has been studied fairly extensively over the last four decades , motivated at first by the discovery of cyclotron lines in accreting x - ray binary pulsars ( see @xcite for her x-1 , @xcite for 4u 0115 + 634 , @xcite for x0331 + 53 , and @xcite for a0535 + 26 ) , a genre of neutron stars .",
    "more recently , constraints on stellar magnetic dipole moments obtained from pulse timing observations have led to the identification of the exotic and highly magnetized class of neutron stars now known as magnetars [ e.g. , see @xcite for the anomalous x - ray pulsar ( axp ) 1e 1841 - 045 , @xcite for soft gamma - ray repeater ( sgr ) 1806 - 20 , @xcite and references therein for axp 4u 0142 + 61 , and @xcite for sgr 1900 + 14 ]  this topical development has promoted a resurgence in the interest of this intriguing physical process . in classical electrodynamics ,",
    "thomson scattering in an external field evinces a pronounced resonance for incoming photons at the cyclotron frequency in the electron rest frame ( erf ) , within the confines of larmor radiation formalism @xcite .",
    "this feature also appears in quantum formulations of magnetic thomson scattering @xcite appropriate for fields gauss . for neutron star applications it is often necessary to employ forms for the magnetic compton scattering cross section that are computed in the relativistic domain",
    "this is dictated by the atmospheric or magnetospheric fields of such compact objects possessing strengths either approaching , or exceeding ( in the case of magnetars ) the quantum critical field gauss , i.e. , that for which the electron cyclotron and electron rest mass energies are equal .",
    "such results from quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) have been offered in various papers @xcite at various levels of analytic and numerical development . in particular , refs .",
    "@xcite highlight the essential contributions provided by relativistic quantum mechanics , namely , the appearance of multiple resonances at various `` harmonics '' of the cyclotron fundamental and strong klein - nishina reductions that are coincident with electron recoil when the incident photon has an energy exceeding around in the electron s initial rest frame . for photons incident at nonzero angles to the magnetic field , the harmonic resonances are not equally spaced in frequency @xcite , and they correspond to kinematic arrangements that permit excitation of the intermediate virtual electron to various landau levels  the discrete eigenvalues of energy transverse to the field .",
    "extant qed calculations of the magnetic compton process in the literature @xcite emphasize frequency domains either away from the resonances , or in the wings of the resonances , and presuming infinitely long - lived intermediate states , and therefore possess divergent resonances at the cyclotron harmonics .",
    "this suffices for several astrophysical applications , for example , the consideration of compton scattering contributions to opacity in forging atmospheric or photospheric structure in magnetars @xcite .",
    "however , for other applications that sample the resonances preferentially , such as the resonant compton upscattering models of magnetar spectra and associated electron cooling in @xcite , a refined treatment of the cross section in the resonances is necessary .",
    "the divergences appear in resonant denominators that emerge from fourier transforms of the spatial and temporal complex exponentials in the wave functions : these denominators capture the essence of precise energy conservation at the peak of the resonance .",
    "since the intermediate state is not infinitely long - lived , its energy specification is not exact , and consequently the divergences are unphysical , and must be suitably truncated .",
    "the appropriate approach is to introduce a finite lifetime or decay width to the virtual electrons for cyclotronic transitions to lower excited landau levels , most commonly to the ground state .",
    "this introduces a breit - wigner prescription and forms a lorentz profile in energy to express the finiteness of the cross section through any resonance @xcite . historically ,",
    "when this approach has been adopted , spin - averaged widths ( i.e. , inverse decay times ) for the virtual electrons have been inserted into the scattering formalism .",
    "while expedient , this is not precise in that a self - consistent treatment of the widths does not amount to a linear characterization of the overall spin dependence .",
    "in other words , averaging the spins in forming does not correctly account for the coupling of the spin dependence of the temporal decay of the intermediate electron with the spin dependence of the spatial portion of its wave functions , i.e. , the spinors . rectifying this oversight in prior work",
    "is a principal objective of this paper .",
    "another technical issue with calculating qed interactions in strong magnetic fields is the choice of the eigenstate solutions to the magnetic dirac equation .",
    "historically , several choices of wave functions have been employed in determinations of the compton scattering cross section and cyclotron decay rates .",
    "the two most widely used wave functions are those of johnson and lippmann ( jl ) @xcite and sokolov and ternov ( st ) @xcite .",
    "the jl wave functions are derived in cartesian coordinates and are eigenstates of the kinetic momentum operator .",
    "the st wave functions , specifically their `` transverse polarization '' states , are derived in cylindrical coordinates and are eigenfunctions of the magnetic moment ( or spin ) operator ( with ) in cartesian coordinates within the confines of the landau gauge .",
    "given the different spin dependence of the st and jl eigenstates , one must use caution in making the appropriate choice when treating spin - dependent processes .",
    "herold , ruder and wunner @xcite and melrose and parle @xcite have noted that the st eigenstates have desirable properties that the jl states do not possess , such as being eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian including radiation corrections , having symmetry between positron and electron states , and diagonalization of the self - energy shift operator .",
    "graziani @xcite and baring , gonthier and harding @xcite noted that spin states in the st formalism for cyclotron transitions are preserved under lorentz boosts along * b * , a convenient property .",
    "in contrast , the jl wave functions mix the spin states under such a lorentz transformation , and therefore are not appropriate for a spin - dependent formulation of the cyclotron process . in @xcite it was observed that the st wave functions are the physically correct choices for spin - dependent treatments and for incorporating widths in the scattering cross section . although the spin - averaged st and jl cyclotron decay rates are equal , their spin - dependent decay rates are not , except in the special case in which the initial component of momentum of the electron parallel to the magnetic field vanishes .",
    "the differential cross sections for both st and jl formalisms of magnetic compton scattering are developed in parallel in this paper , for all initial and final configurations of photon polarization .",
    "they apply for kinematic domains below pair creation threshold .",
    "these are implemented for both spin - average cyclotronic decay rates and spin - dependent widths for the intermediate state , which are employed in a breit - wigner prescription to render the cyclotron resonances finite .",
    "this element of the analysis mirrors closely that in @xcite .",
    "the st formulation uses the general formalism presented by @xcite , while the jl case is an adaptation of the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the developments are specialized early on to the particular case of photons propagating along * b * in the erf .",
    "this is actually quite an important case in astrophysical settings , since it corresponds to interactions where relativistic electrons are speeding along magnetic field lines above the stellar surface . in such cases , lorentz boosting parallel to * b * collimates the interacting photon angles in the erf almost along the local field line .",
    "the analysis spans a wide range of field strengths , focusing particularly on the regime around gauss gauss , and thereby magnetic domains pertinent to millisecond pulsars , young radio and gamma - ray pulsars , and magnetars .",
    "in particular , focus on the resonance regime is germane to compton upscattering models @xcite of the hard x - ray tails observed in quiescent emission above 10 kev from several magnetars @xcite .",
    "the inverse compton process , where ultrarelativistic electrons scatter seed x - ray photons from the surface of a neutron star , has gained popularity as the preferred mechanism for generating these powerful pulsed signals , primarily due to the efficiency of scattering in the cyclotron resonances for strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the cross section calculations presented in this paper will also be pertinent to future computations of compton opacity in dynamic plasma outflows that are postulated @xcite to be responsible for hard x - ray flaring activity seen in magnetars ( e.g. , see @xcite for sgr j0501 + 4516 and @xcite for axp 1e 1841 - 045 and sgr j1550 - 5418 ) .",
    "after developing the general formalism for the scattering differential cross section in sec .",
    "[ sec : csect_formalism ] , the exposition narrows the focus to the incoming photons beamed along the local field direction in the erf , denoted by .",
    "this culminates in the relatively compact formulas for the polarization - dependent cross sections in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsigmas ] ) for st , jl , and spin - averaged analyses .",
    "the specialization simplifies the mathematical development dramatically , since the associated laguerre functions that appear as the transverse dependence ( with respect to * b * ) of the eigenfunctions of the magnetic dirac equation reduce to comparatively simple exponentials .",
    "furthermore , only the single resonance at the cyclotron fundamental appears .",
    "various elements of the numerical character of the differential and total cross sections are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : csect_results ] . outside the resonance ,",
    "spin influences are purely linear in their contributions , and so both st and jl formulations collapse to the spin - averaged case , as expected . in the resonance ,",
    "appreciable differences between the st , jl , and spin - averaged formulations arise , at the level of around 50% when gauss , and rising to a factor of 3 for one polarization scattering mode in fields gauss .",
    "the origin of this difference is in the fact that the coupling between the intermediate electron s momentum parallel to the field and its spin in defining its decay width is dependent on the choice of eigenfunction solutions of the magnetic dirac equation .",
    "it is in this resonant regime that the physically self - consistent , spin - dependent sokolov and ternov cross sections presented in this paper provide an important new contribution to the physics of magnetic compton scattering .",
    "an interesting anomaly emerges from spin - dependent influences at very low initial photon frequencies , i.e. , well below the cyclotron fundamental , and is highlighted in sec .",
    "[ sec : low_freq ] . in the domain ,",
    "the finite lifetime of the intermediate state is inferior to the inverse frequency , and so the cross section saturates at a small constant value , times the thomson value .",
    "this dominates the usual low - frequency behavior for the case @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : res_peak ] , to facilitate broader utility of the new st results offered here for use in astrophysical applications , compact analytic approximate expressions for the differential cross section are derived in eq .",

    "( [ eq : sig_resonance_fin ] ) and  ( [ eq : sig_resonance_perp_fin ] ) , fairly simple results whose integrals can be efficiently computed when employing a convenient series expansion in terms of legendre polynomials .",
    "these approximate resonant cross section results include both polarization - dependent and polarization - averaged forms , and are accurate to better than the 0.1% level .",
    "the net product is a suite of compton scattering physics developments that can be easily deployed in neutron star radiation models .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion of the issue of photon dispersion in the magnetized vacuum .",
    "it is indicated that for astrophysically interesting field strengths , i.e. , those below around gauss , vacuum dispersion is generally small : the refractive indices of the birefringent modes deviate from unity by a few percent , at most , and generally much less .",
    "accordingly , the influence of such dispersion on kinematic quantities pertaining to the photons is neglected in the scattering developments offered here .",
    "the compton cross section can be developed along the lines of the work of daugherty & harding @xcite and more recent work of sina @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we begin with more general elements of the formalism , and then specialize to our specific developments that focus on incident photons propagating along the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic compton scattering cross section can be expressed as integrations of the square of the @xmath0-matrix element over the pertinent phase space factors for produced electrons and photons .",
    "the protocols for its development are standard in quantum electrodynamics , and , for unmagnetized systems , can be found in works by jauch and rohrlich @xcite ( see secs . 8 - 6 and 11 - 1 , therein , for nonmagnetic compton formalism ) .",
    "when , the formulation is modified somewhat to take into account the quantization of momenta perpendicular to * b * ( assumed to be in the direction throughout ) , and , to a large extent , parallel to the two - photon magnetic pair annihilation exposition in @xcite [ see eq .",

    "<S> the quantum electrodynamical ( qed ) process of compton scattering in strong magnetic fields is commonly invoked in atmospheric and inner magnetospheric models of x - ray and soft gamma - ray emission in high - field pulsars and magnetars . </S>",
    "<S> a major influence of the field is to introduce resonances at the cyclotron frequency and its harmonics , where the incoming photon accesses thresholds for the creation of virtual electrons or positrons in intermediate states with excited landau levels . at these resonances , </S>",
    "<S> the effective cross section typically exceeds the classical thomson value by over 2 orders of magnitude . near and above the quantum critical magnetic field of 44.13 teragauss </S>",
    "<S> , relativistic corrections must be incorporated when computing this cross section . </S>",
    "<S> this profound enhancement underpins the anticipation that resonant compton scattering is a very efficient process in the environs of highly magnetized neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents formalism for the qed magnetic compton differential cross section valid for both subcritical and supercritical fields , yet restricted to scattered photons that are below pair creation threshold.calculations are developed for the particular case of photons initially propagating along the field , and in the limit of zero vacuum dispersion , mathematically simple specializations that are germane to interactions involving relativistic electrons frequently found in neutron star magnetospheres . </S>",
    "<S> this exposition of relativistic , quantum , magnetic compton cross sections treats electron spin dependence fully , since this is a critical feature for describing the finite decay lifetimes of the intermediate states . </S>",
    "<S> such lifetimes are introduced to truncate the resonant cyclotronic divergences via standard lorentz profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism employs both the traditional johnson and lippmann ( jl ) wave functions and the sokolov and ternov ( st ) electron eigenfunctions of the magnetic dirac equation . </S>",
    "<S> the st states are formally correct for self - consistently treating spin - dependent effects that are so important in the resonances . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the values of the polarization - dependent differential cross section depend significantly on the choice of st or jl eigenstates when in the fundamental resonance , but not outside of it , a characteristic that is naturally expected . </S>",
    "<S> relatively compact analytic forms for the cross sections are presented that will prove useful for astrophysical modelers .    </S>",
    "<S> accepted for publication ( august 2014 ) in physical review d. </S>"
