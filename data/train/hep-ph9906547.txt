    "processes induced by initial state photons provide us with an interesting testing ground for qcd . as a photon can interacts directly through a pointlike coupling with quarks or through its parton content like a hadron it has a twofold nature .",
    "its point - like interaction gives rise to perturbatively calculable short - distance contributions @xcite while its hadron - like or resolved part can not be described with perturbative methods .",
    "it is described in terms of the parton distribution functions inside the photon .",
    "these parton distributions obey a perturbative evolution equation with a non - perturbative boundary condition usually parameterized in the form of an initial distribution at some low starting scale @xmath3 .",
    "the pointlike and resolved processes contribute to the various real structure functions entering the cross section for @xmath4 , the object of this study .",
    "the process of compton backscattering of laser beams off highly energetic electrons / positrons offers an efficient mechanism to transfer a large fraction of the lepton energy to the photon which structure can be investigated in deep inelastic electron - photon scattering .    the differential compton cross section for the process @xmath5 , where the polarization of the final state photon @xmath6 is not observed takes the following form @xcite , @xmath7 the energy transferred from the electron to the backscattered photon is denoted by @xmath8 .",

    "the parameter @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the energies of the incoming electron and photon . by tuning the energy of the incoming photon",
    ", the parameter @xmath17 can be chosen close to 4.83 , just below the threshold for production of @xmath18 pairs from the collision of laser and final state photons . to give an order of magnitude , for an energy of the incoming lepton of @xmath19 , the laser energy is of the order of @xmath20 .",
    "it is worth noting that the photon luminosity for backscattered photons is of the same order as the initial electron luminosity .",
    "it is therefore enhanced compared to the photon luminosity obtained for photon produced by bremsstrahlung off the lepton which is of @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , by choosing the helicities of laser and electron beams to be opposite , the photon spectrum is peaked at high energies . in this region , about 80% of the energy of the electron / positron beam can be transferred to the backscattered photon . in the following",
    "we shall give our predictions for the most advantageous photon spectrum and will therefore consider the backscattered photon obtained for opposite polarizations of electron and laser photon , with @xmath22 .",
    "our results will be obtained for the cross section @xmath23 which is related to the cross section for @xmath24 as follows , @xmath25",
    "at momentum transfer squared @xmath0 close to the z and w masses squared , the deep inelastic cross section for @xmath26 becomes sensitive to contributions from these exchanges @xcite .",
    "neutral current deep inelastic events are characterized by the exchange of a photon or a z boson , and have an electron and a jet ( or jets ) in the final state .",
    "charged current events arise via the exchange of a w - boson and contain an undetected neutrino and a jet ( or jets ) in the final state .",
    "the presence of an neutrino is as usual detected as missing transverse momentum .",

    "indeed we have , @xmath41 the initial state photon is real and on - shell and the lepton masses can be set to zero .",
