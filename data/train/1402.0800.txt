    "in previous works @xcite zamick and escuderos addressed the problem of maximum @xmath2-pairing .",
    "in the course of these studies they found that results simplified by the fact that a certain coupling matrix element was very small .",
    "this was the unitary @xmath0 coefficient @xmath1 for small @xmath3 e.g. @xmath7 .",
    "the work started in the @xmath8 shell . but",
    "as one went to higher shells this @xmath9 becomes rapidly smaller .",
    "indeed behavior was parametrized as @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the consequence of a very weak coupling is that for small total angular momentum @xmath3 the lowest 2 states for a maximum @xmath10 pairing interaction are @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 both even @xcite . in this work",
    "we will first conduct numerical studies to much higher angular momenta and with greater precision for the unitary @xmath0 coefficients using mathematica .",
    "we will then approach the problem analytically and derive the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we also consider cases where @xmath3 is large .",
    "as was noted in @xcite at first glance @xmath17 seems to fall of exponentially with @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests a form @xmath18 for this form @xmath19 . if this were true there would be a linear relationship between @xmath20 and @xmath2 .",
    "we will here also consider other values of @xmath3 as indicated above .",
    "we first plot , in figure  [ fig : lngraph ] , @xmath21 vs @xmath2 for all even @xmath3 values between @xmath7 and @xmath22 .",
    "the curves indeed approach straight lines indicating that the @xmath23 s drops exponentially with @xmath2 .",
    "this is certainly the dominant trend but there are small deviations indicated by the error analysis .",
    "we try a more elaborate form @xmath24 we consider the ratio @xmath25 if we assume that @xmath26 , then we have @xmath27 with some algebra this becomes @xmath28 it is obvious to see the factors which cancel out , then we take the ln of both sides and obtain @xmath29 we therefor have the extracted @xmath16 @xmath30 it should be noted that in the large @xmath2 limit @xmath31 approaches @xmath32 .",
    "we plot some cases of @xmath16 vs. @xmath2 in the attached figures  [ fig : firstmgraph ] to  [ fig : allmgraph ] .",
    "we find that all even @xmath3 from @xmath7 to @xmath33 , @xmath16 converges to 1.5 in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "it is important to note that in order to obtain the asymptotic value of @xmath16 in eq.([eq : asymp ] ) one must go to a sufficiently large value of @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore the bigger the value of @xmath3 the higher one has to go in @xmath2 . to show the perils of choosing the maximum @xmath2 too small",
    "suppose we choose it to by 500.5 , which a priori most would consider to be a very large number .",
    "the values of @xmath16 for @xmath34 respectively 1.495 , 1.481 , 1.391 , 1.085 , and 0.577 . we now see a steady decrease in @xmath16 as @xmath3 increases , which could lead to the false conclusion that there is a different asymptotic value of @xmath16 for each @xmath3 .",
    "however when we choose @xmath2 large enough e.g. up to 7000.5 for @xmath22 we see that the asymptotic value of @xmath16 is the same for all even @xmath3 up to @xmath22 , namely @xmath35 . it should be noted that convergence is slower as @xmath3 increases .",
    "we next consider @xmath23 for the largest values of @xmath3 .",
    "we start with @xmath36 and then also consider @xmath37 , @xmath38 , etc .",
    "we find that @xmath39 approaches a constant for large @xmath2 shown in figure  [ fig : justimax ] .",
    "we assume that the form of the asymptote is @xmath40 then we plot @xmath41 versus @xmath2 to determine if this value approaches a constant .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : allimax ] .",
    "we can conclude then that the asymptote for large @xmath3 adheres to eq.([eq : maxasymp ] ) .    a formula involving many factorials for the case @xmath42 is also given by varshalovich et al . in sec.10:8:4 eq.(14 ) in @xcite .",
    "we finally remind the reader that our motivation for this work comes from our desire to ether understand the wave function arising from a `` maximum @xmath10-pairing '' hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the numerical results in the previous section for the small @xmath3 cases lead to the result @xmath35 and the figures showed a dominantly exponential decrease with @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we can show some analytical results .",
    "we note that there is an explicit formula for the @xmath0 symbol associated with the unitary @xmath0 coefficient above in the work of varshalovich et al .",
    "@xcite sec 10:8:3 eq.(9 ) shown here : @xmath43 @xmath44^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] we associate @xmath45 ; @xmath46 ; @xmath47 ; and @xmath48 . for some simplification",
    "we define a new variable @xmath49 .",
    "we apply that expression to this problem and consider @xmath9 rather than @xmath0 , @xmath50^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\times\\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{2(2i+1)}}\\times\\left < j(j-2)00|i0\\right>\\ ] ] thus we have related the @xmath9 to a clebsch - gordan(cg ) coefficient .    for the particular @xmath9 above and for @xmath7",
    "we obtain the following expression @xmath51^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\times\\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{10}}\\times\\left < j(j-2)00|20\\right>\\ ] ] this special @xmath9 is proportional to a clebsch - gordan coefficient .",
    "there is a useful formula in talmi s book @xcite for the associated @xmath52 symbol shown here : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55    there is a simpler formula in talmi s book @xcite for this coefficient when @xmath7 : @xmath56 it is easy to see that the cg coefficient falls off as @xmath57 .",
    "we now get the combined expression @xmath58 the exponential behavior comes from the factorials via the stirling approximation @xmath59",
    "if we stop there we get @xmath60 however to get the correct asymptotic behavior we must go beyond this and include one more term to obtain the more accurate stirling approximation @xmath61 using the extended stirling approximation this becomes @xmath62 recall that we had assigned @xmath49 and then taking a inverse logarithm of this yields a contribution @xmath63 when we go from @xmath2 to @xmath64 we get a decreases of about 16 from the exponential factor .",
    "this decrease dominates over the increase from the second factor . the second factor and",
    "the other terms must contribute to get the @xmath65 part which serves to reduce this ratio a bit .",
    "if the `` small '' term in the stirling approximation is neglected a problem arises .",
    "the factors under the square root sign clearly go as @xmath66 in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "however the clebsch - gordan coefficient decreases with @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to an effective @xmath16 less than @xmath67 .",
    "however numerical calculations @xcite clearly indicate that @xmath6 .",
    "hence , although the simplest version of the stirling approximation gives the right exponential behavior it gives the wrong @xmath65 dependence . by including the `` small correction '' we take care of this problem .",
    "analytic expressions of specific @xmath0 coefficients have been previously considered for special cases e.g. for the case of partial dynamical symmetries by robinson and zamick @xcite .",
    "many relations for @xmath0 symbols were found by zhao and arima @xcite in the context of maximum @xmath2-pairing hamiltonians .",
    "explicit studies of the asymptotic behavious of @xmath0 coefficients have been performed by anderson et .",
    "@xcite and by yu and littlejohn @xcite .",
    "what distinguishes the present work from the ones just mentioned is that only here do we consider @xmath0s which display an exponential decrease with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "this is called non - classical behavior by the experts .",
    "the large difference in behavior comes from the fact that we are considering coupling matrix elements involving 2 different @xmath10 values @xmath68 and @xmath69 whereas in zhao and arima @xcite for the problem they are addressing they have the same @xmath10 values .",
    "ironically we have to be in the non - classical region mathematically to reach the classical limit for the physical problem in question .",
    "we now consider the region near @xmath36 .",
    "it should be pointed out that whereas in the small @xmath3 case we kept @xmath3 fixed as we increased @xmath2 , here as we change @xmath2 we change @xmath3 .",
    "thus we are making different comparisons .",
    "the figures confirm that for this analysis there is a power law behavior rather than an exponential one .",
    "the @xmath9 goes as @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "it should be noted that for @xmath36 the value of the @xmath9 was shown by talmi  @xcite to be @xmath72    note that this 9j approaches 1/2 when j becomes very large .",
    "subsequently an alternate proof was provided by bayman@xcite .    for large @xmath3 we write @xmath73 and assume @xmath74 is much smalller than @xmath2 .",
    "we use a more general formula in talmi s book @xcite ( top of page 960 ) for @xmath75 .    we can get an expression for all @xmath74 by using the stirling approximation for factorials involving large parameters but not for those involving only @xmath74 .",
    "we obtain the following result : @xmath76 as @xmath2 becomes very large .",
    "one can verify that for @xmath77 this is indeed @xmath78 and note that for @xmath79 we get @xmath80 .",
    "one notes that in this limit ( @xmath74 much smaller than @xmath2 ) the clebsch - gordan coefficient goes as @xmath81 ( alternatively the @xmath52 goes as @xmath82 ) in the large @xmath2 limit . in more detail",
    "we have : @xmath83 the @xmath81 behavior in the large @xmath3 limit is in contrast to the behavior in the previous section where @xmath3 was fixed at a small value whilst @xmath2 was increased . in that case the clebsch - gordan coefficient from  eq.([eq : clebsch ] ) went as @xmath84 . in this work our motivation for studying the specific @xmath9 coefficients above , was to better understand the wave functions of a maximum @xmath10-pairing hamiltonian .",
    "what we had previously shown numerically we now have attempted to show analytically .",
    "we found the numerical results crucial in guiding us to the analytical ones .",
    "we have succeeded in getting analytic expressions for the asymptotic behaviors for small @xmath3 by using the extended stirling approximation .",
    "we are also able to make statements about the large @xmath3 problem .",
    "we would like to thank ben bayman and igal talmi for their valuable help and interest .",
    "brian kleszyk also thanks the rutgers aresty research center for undergraduate research for support during the 2013 - 2014 academic year .",
    "in this paper we focus on equations ( 11 and 13 ) , and ( 23 and 24 ) of the work of kleszyk and zamick @xcite .",
    "in particular we consider the case when the total angular momentum @xmath3is equal to @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and @xmath87 we take the limit of large @xmath2 where @xmath74 becomes much smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "we also define @xmath49 , where @xmath2 is the .",
    "we first address the 3@xmath2 coefficient : @xmath88 we then also can define @xmath3 using a new variable @xmath16 with @xmath89 , and this time @xmath90 we can separate parts of the 3@xmath2 which now becomes @xmath91 where the 6 factors @xmath92 are : @xmath93 we use the stirling approximation , @xmath94 and it should be noted that the approximation approaches the true value asymptotically .",
    "now we can write : @xmath95 with differing constant coefficients . in eq .",
    "we give the contribuition of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "for the latter we break things up into ( a)``extreme '' and ( b ) `` next order '' .",
    "this is necessary because `` next order '' has contriutions comparable to those in `` @xmath98 '' .",
    "first notice that `` @xmath97 '' result is @xmath78 , which cancels the @xmath99 from `` @xmath98 '' . adding up all the totals we get @xmath100 @xmath101 taking the antilog we get @xmath102 and",
    "note that @xmath103 .    putting everything together and putting things in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath74",
    "we obtain @xmath104 we see that in the limit @xmath105 , @xmath52 goes as @xmath82 .",
    "alternatively the clebsch - gordan has an asymptotic value @xmath106      again we will write @xmath89 , with @xmath90 and we can rewrite eq.(11 ) from @xcite as @xmath107 where @xmath108 with @xmath109 then we also have @xmath110 there are @xmath111 terms in @xmath112 .",
    "asymptotically we obtain @xmath113 @xmath114 hence we have @xmath115          there are many cancellations when we add the totals of @xmath118 and @xmath119 in table  [ table:3j ] and table  [ table : u9j ] .",
    "the result is @xmath120 the antilog is @xmath121 all the @xmath2 dependance the @xmath2 dependence comes from @xmath122 and prod @xmath123 putting everything together we obtain the result : @xmath124              we quickly run into trouble in making a comparison with our results , especially for @xmath77 . in their eq.(b12 )",
    "they have in the leading term cg proportional to @xmath128 .",
    "however for the case @xmath129 , that is to say @xmath130 , with our @xmath77 , we see that @xmath131 vanishes and hence their expression for cg blows up .",
    "evidently their formula is not valid in this region . on the other hand our expression eq.(13 ) from @xcite works",
