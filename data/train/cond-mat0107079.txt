    "the study of interplay of noise and nonlinear dynamics presents many challenges in systems under non equilibrium conditions .",
    "these systems exhibit wide variety of novel physical outcomes(simple to complex ) .",
    "a nonequilibrium system is one in which there is a net energy flow from external sources .",
    "many different models employing stochastic processes in physics , chemistry , engineering and biological sciences have lead to discovery of several noise induced phenomena in systems far away from equilibrium .",
    "prominent examples are noise induced phase transitions , stochastic resonance , resonant activation , noise induced stability of unstable states , noise induced unidirectional transport of particles in the absence of obvious bias ( thermal ratchets or theory of molecular motors ) , noise induced ordering ranging from separation of different materials into heterogeneous final state to the formation of a rich variety of regular patterns , self organization , etc[1 - 8 ] . the list is not exhaustive by any means . in all these phenomena mentioned above noise",
    "plays an active role ( active noise paradigm ) .",
    "noise or fluctuations arise either because of the coupling of system to an external unknown system or from the thermal bath .",
    "the presence of noise can alter the behaviour of system in a fundamental way - a change that has nothing to do with the sensitive dependence of initial conditions as in the chaotic systems .",
    "in contrast to the general notion that noise is undesirable and destructive , in many nonequilibrium systems it plays a constructive and stabilizing role in the dynamics .",
    "the most of the phenomena mentioned above exist only in the presence of noise , i.e. , they can not be observed in the absence of noise .",
    "hence noise acts as a generator of order as opposed to generator of disorder .",
    "even when the magnitude of noise is small , the probability of the macrostate depends on the details of the global kinetics and can not be determined by the macrostate alone . in other words the stability criteria which examine only the immediate vicinity of a locally stable state are inadequate to assess the relative stability of states in a nonequilibrium system .",
    "the kinetics of unstable intermediate state even as these are rarely populated can have a dramatic effect on the relative stability of states .",
    "this leads to the notion of local versus global stability criteria that will be discussed in the following sections .    in the present work",
    "we will be mainly concerned with the nature of directed motion induced by the random noise in inhomogeneous systems in the absence of bias .",
    "the noise induced active transport in a fluctuating environment arises from so - called ratchet mechanism[7 - 24 ] . here",
    ", nonequilibrium fluctuations combined with spatial or temporal anisotropy conspire to generate systematic motion even in the absence of any net bias .",
    "it should be noted that in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics usable work can not be extracted if only equilibrium fluctuations are present . in thermal equilibrium",
    "the principle of detailed balance prohibits net particle current in any system .",
    "in contrast , in a nonequilibrium situation , where the detailed balance is lost , net current flow is possible , i.e. , one can extract energy by rectifying fluctuations or at the expense of overall increased entropy .",
    "the problem of rectification at brownian scale was posed much earlier by smoluchowski[25 ] and feynman[26 ] .",
    "a major motivation for these studies(stimulating interaction between biology and physics ) comes from the plausible theoretical arguments for the motion of molecular kinesin[1,7,8,11 ] .",
    "the kinesin molecule belongs to a class of proteins known as motor molecules .",
    "these molecules which include dyneins and myosin move along the structural filaments such as microtubules , microfilaments .",
    "the motor molecules are used for the transportation of organnelles(cargo , chemicals ) for intra cellular transport and muscle contraction or to power muscles .",
    "the energy source for these molecules comes from hydrolysis of atp . in atp energy",
    "is stored in the phosphate bonds , this energy is released when the bond is hydrolyzed and adp is produced .",
    "the motor proteins use this energy to bring about unidirectional motion along the biopolymers . here",
    "chemical energy is converted into mechanical energy .",
    "the fluctuations in the potentials experienced by the motors are believed to arise from the binding and dissociation of atp , and the anisotropic periodic potential as representing the electrostatic potential along the long structural filament . in these systems",
    "it is known that there is no known gradient of chemical concentration or the temperature , to determine the direction of the movement .",
    "moreover , it is also clear that the motion of these motors can be described as a over damped motion of a brownian particles . at any time",
    "the velocity @xmath0 of the particle is proportional to the force @xmath1 on the particle .",
    "these particles experience random kicks from the surrounding medium and the average thermal energy of a particle is @xmath2 .",
    "this energy @xmath2 is comparable to the other involved energy scales in the problem , such as the barrier heights .",
    "hence brownian motion plays an essential role in the action of motors .",
    "thus , protein motors operate in a brownian regime where inertia is negligible and thermal fluctuations are important .    with a primary motivation to explain the unidirectional motion of molecular motors the subject of noise induced transport has gone beyond the biological realm . in physics , area of thermal ratchets are being explored to investigate new methods for controlled devices of high resolution for particle separation[27 ] .",
    "these devices are expected to be superior to existing methods such as electrophoretic method for particles of micrometer scale , like cells , latex spheres , dna or proteins . for this",
    "the current reversal phenomenon is one of the most interesting aspect of the theory of brownian ratchets , i.e. , magnitude and the direction of the brownian particles are very sensitive to their masses .",
    "new questions regarding the nature of heat engines ( reversible and irreversible ) at atomic or molecular scales , their energetics , and the efficiency of the energy conversion are being studied[28 ] . in brownian heat engines",
    "one would also like to understand the possible sources of irreversibility and whether the irreversibility can be suppressed such that the efficiency approaches that of a carnot cycle .    the collection of large number of interacting brownian particles exhibit cooperative effects .",
    "interactions can lead to dynamical phase transitions and instabilities that characterise the behaviour of motor collections .",
    "it turns out that cooperative motors can generate a directed force even if the system is symmetric[29 ] .",
    "the direction of motion of a symmetric system is selected by spontaneous symmetry breaking . in symmetric case , the transition is isomorphous to a paramagnet - ferromagnet transition , in the asymmetric case to a liquid - vapor transition . in some special cases",
    "the coupled systems display amazing features when exposed to an externally applied force .",
    "the most prominent being a zero - bias negative conductance and anomalous hysteresis[30 ] , which are completely new collective phenomena . in game theory based on",
    "the theory of brownian ratchets , new area of paradoxical gambling games have emerged under the subject of parronodo s paradoxes[31 ] . here , two losing ( with probability one ) gambling games , when combined or played in a random sequence , can lead to a winning game with probability one !",
    "it has also been suggested that mobility - induced transport can be used as a concept of possibilities to think about social and financial systems that are so often out of equilibrium[32 ] .",
    "ratchet devices based on quantum processes have been proposed . using quantum dots these devices",
    "have been investigated experimentally .",
    "net currents due to quantum coherent motion of electrons have been observed even when the applied ac voltage is zero on average .",
    "strikingly the direction of the current is reversed as a function of temperature , exhibiting quantum to classical cross over , the phenomenon is of fundamental importance in the foundations of quantum mechanics[33 - 34 ] .",
    "several qualitatively different physical models for noise induced transport have been proposed , namely , rocking ratchets , flashing ratchets , diffusion ratchets , correlation ratchets , frictional ratchets , etc . for this",
    "we refer the readers to an excellent recent review by reimann[8 ] .",
    "most of these studies are restricted to non - interacting particles . in this article",
    "we confine to the physics in inhomogeneous medium where brownian particles experience the friction coefficient and/or temperature to be non uniform in space . we find out a model with minimal conditions that the inhomogeneous system assisted by fluctuating forces must satisfy in order to obtain unidirectional current . for this",
    "we develop a self consistent approach based on microscopic treatment[24,35 ] . in the process",
    "we discuss about thermal and frictional ratchets that are of current interest . in these inhomogeneous systems",
    "we show that directed current can be obtained even in spatially periodic symmetric potentials . the inversion symmetry in these systems being broken dynamically by the space dependent frictional coefficient or temperature inhomogeneity .",
    "several other conditions to obtain noise induced transport can be relaxed in regard to the nature of external noise and their statistics as compared to non frictional ratchets .",
    "we explain the possibility of obtaining current reversals even in the adiabatic regime of rocked frictional ratchets as a function of system parameters[36,37 ] . in a non - adiabatic regime",
    "multiple current reversals can be observed[38 ] .",
    "following the treatment of stochastic energetics we discuss the efficiency of the energy transduction and give conditions under which noise can facilitate the energy conversion .",
    "nature of system inhomogeneity plays important role in deciding the nonequilibrium and kinetic properties of the system .",
    "most of the systems that one comes across in nature are inhomogeneous .",
    "these inhomogeneities could be structural , configurational , entropic , temperature non - uniformities , etc .",
    "brownian motion in confined geometries or in porous media show space dependent friction[39 ] .",
    "particles diffusing close to surface have a space dependent friction coefficient[39,40 ] .",
    "it is believed that molecular motor proteins move close along the periodic structure of microtubules and therefore experience a position dependent mobility[32 ] .",
    "frictional inhomogeneities are common in super lattice structures and in semiconductor systems[20 ] . in josephson junctions periodically varying frictional coefficient corresponds to the term representing interference between the quasiparticle tunneling and the cooper pair tunneling[41 ] .",
    "nonuniformity in temperature can have important consequences on the particle motion , for instance , the kinetics of growth of crystalline nuclei in the melt around its critical size .",
    "the latent heat generation being , in this example , responsible for the creation of nonuniform temperature field across the surface of the nucleus .",
    "one can have inhomogeneous temperature field because of nonuniform distribution of phonons and electrons(or of quasiparticles in general ) with different characteristic temperatures in the solid[22 ] .",
    "temperature inhomogeneities can also be induced by external pumping of noise in the system .",
    "we would like to emphasize and show explicitly later that the variations in space dependent friction does not alter the equilibrium properties of the system , however , affects the dynamics of the system in a nontrivial way .",
    "the relative stability of the competing states is generally governed by the usual boltzmann factor . in the presence of nonuniform temperature",
    "the relative stability of two states is sensitive to detailed kinetics all along the pathways ( on the potential surface between the two states under comparison ) .",
    "we reason in the present work that system inhomogeneity may provide a clear and unifying framework to approach the problem of macroscopic motion under discussion .",
    "the existing popular models,[8 - 19 ] currently in the literature , mostly take the nonequilibrium fluctuations to be non - gaussian white ( colored ) noise together with a ratchetlike periodic potential to aid unidirectional motion of an overdamped brownian particle .",
    "the ratchetlike periodic system potentials @xmath3 , obviously violate parity @xmath4 .",
    "for such potentials one can readily calculate steady current flow @xmath5 of a brownian particle in the presence of an external field @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath5 is not an odd function of @xmath1 and in general , @xmath6 in the regime of nonlinear response .",
    "in other words , reversal of the external force may not lead to a reversed current of the same magnitude in sharp contrast to the case of a nonratchetlike ( symmetric ) periodic potential system where @xmath5= @xmath7 follows . from this general observation , in a ratchetlike potential , it can be easily concluded that on application of a zero time averaged periodic field , say @xmath1=@xmath8 , one can obtain net unidirectional current .",
    "thus ratchet may also be described as a nonlinear rectifier .",
    "the currents exhibit maxima both as a function of the forcing amplitude as well as temperature .",
    "when the forcing amplitude is small the motion is determined by the thermal activation rates ( kramer s time scales ) or overcoming the barriers to the left and right .",
    "jump rates being asymmetric , we obtain a finite average drift velocity for nonzero forcing term .",
    "the average velocity is quite small at low temperatures due to the arrehenius prefactor . at intermediate temperature ,",
    "the jumps are more frequent and at high temperatures , jumps in both direction are of equal likelihood and the magnitude of the net current falls .",
    "for this reason we observe a maxima in current at finite temperature .",
    "this is the basic physics behind some of the physical models ( known as rocked ratchet ) used to obtain current rectification in a periodic potential system .",
    "there are models , however , that do not use oscillating external fields . instead , colored noise of zero average strength-dichotomous , ornstein - uhlenbeck , kangaroo processes, ... [11 - 13 ] , is used to drive the brownian particle to obtain macroscopic motion in a ratchetlike potential system .",
    "we would like to emphasize that in rocked ratchet it is possible to obtain unidirectional current even in the absence of thermal noise , i.e. , in the deterministic limit when the potential is asymmetric and the amplitude of the rocking force can be such that tilt in one direction can destroy all energy barriers allowing the particle to slide down ( running state ) .",
    "however , they still have barriers when the potential is tilted by the same amount in the opposite direction and hence preventing the particle motion in the opposite direction . in this deterministic limit ,",
    "motion exhibit intriguing structures as the function of forcing amplitude , such as current quantization and phase locking behaviour[38 ] .",
    "inclusion of inertial effect allows the possibility of having both regular and chaotic dynamics .",
    "this deterministically induced chaos can mimic the role of noise .",
    "the system exhibits multiple current reversals with respect to the forcing amplitude . however , all these effects are not robust in the presence of noise .",
    "there are further interesting models where the potential barriers themselves are allowed to fluctuate ( flashing ratchet ) , for instance , with finite time correlations between two states under the influence of a noise source[8,11 ] .",
    "an example being an overdamped brownian particle subjected to a ratchetlike periodic potential , where the asymmetric saw - tooth potential ( in which two edges of the teeth make different angles with the vertical ) is switched on to its full strength for time @xmath9 during which the brownian particle slides down the potential slope to the bottom of the potential minima ( fixed point ) . at the end of @xmath9 , the system is put in the other ( @xmath10 ) state during which the potential is set equal to a constant ( say = 0 , simplest case ) for an interval @xmath11 and the particle executes free diffusive motion . at the end of @xmath11 the system",
    "is put back in the @xmath12 state for interval @xmath9 . this process of flipping of states is repeated ad - infinitum .",
    "if @xmath11 is adjusted in such a way that by the end of @xmath11 the diffusive motion just takes the particle out of the ( now nonexistent ) potential minima in the steeper slope direction ( smaller distance , say in right direction ) of the saw - tooth potential but fails to do so in the gentler slope direction ( larger distance ) , the immediate next @xmath12 interval will take the particle to the adjacent minimum in the steeper slope side of the saw - tooth potential .",
    "repetition of such sequential flipping of states for a large number of times lead to a net unidirectional macroscopic current ( in the right direction ) of the brownian particle .",
    "it should be noted that a symmetrical nonratchetlike potential(fluctuating between two states ) would , instead , have yielded symmetrical excursions of the brownian particle and , hence , no net unidirectional motion . in this mechanism to obtain net current of the brownian particle the system is supplied with the required energy externally to flip the system between the two states keeping the interval @xmath9 and @xmath11 fixed ( thus the system is in a nonequilibrium state ) .",
    "there is a lot of freedom to play around with the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath11 , the saw tooth potential , and the thermal noise strength . and",
    "a judicious tuning of these parameters could even result in the reversal of the current .",
    "the flipping process could , however , be effected also by a finite time - correlated fluctuating dichotomous force .",
    "it should be noted that the former flipping process of definite @xmath9 and @xmath11 have been practically exploited in the particle separation techniques , whereas the latter fluctuating flipping time process has some appeal to natural processes .",
    "the diversity of the models just does not end here . unlike rocking ratchets ( deterministic limit with high amplitude of rocking ) , thermal fluctuations are essential to get net unidirectional motion in all models of flashing ratchets .",
    "interestingly in all these flashing ratchet models particle need not climb the barrier , it only has to slide down the potential slope .",
    "there have been attempts too to obtain macroscopic current with gaussian white noise under nonratchetlike symmetric periodic potential field as well but subjected to temporally asymmetric periodic external fields [ 16 - 18 ] .",
    "we do not attempt here , however , to give a review of the models considered .",
    "we present , in the following , a framework to obtain macroscopic motion in an inhomogeneous system with space dependent friction coefficient and nonuniform temperature fields restricting ourselves to periodic potential systems .    in all the models",
    "just mentioned [ 8 ] ( the list is not exhaustive . ) the system was taken to be homogeneous as far as the question of diffusivity was concerned . however , in some of the works , earlier to the ones alluded to so far , the nonuniformity of the diffusion constant of the system was considered to yield macroscopic transport [ 20 - 21 ] .",
    "the diffusion coefficient could be space dependent or state dependent and so the system may dissipate energy during its time evolution differently at different space points . unlike homogeneous systems , however , the physics of inhomogeneous systems has not been free from controversies[21,44 ] , such as , whether the equation    = ,    or + @xmath13     + should be the correct form of diffusion equation .",
    "nevertheless , such controversies apart , b@xmath14ttiker [ 20 ] and also van kampen [ 21 ] have shown that one can expect macroscopic transport of a brownian particle in a periodic potential field when the diffusion coefficient is also periodic with the same periodicity but shifted by a phase difference other than 0 and @xmath15 with respect to the periodic potential field .",
    "it should be noted that the potential field is not required to be ratchetlike .",
    "the system is rendered nonequilibrium by diffusion coefficient inhomogeneity in the system and the `` stationary state '' of the system is no longer governed by the usual boltzmann factor . in the theory , one needs to go beyond the phenomenological description .    in reference [ 35 ] , a microscopic treatment is given for the derivation of the macroscopic equations of motion in an inhomogeneous medium ( space dependent friction coefficient and spatially nonuniform temperature ) starting from a microscopic hamiltonian of the system in contact with ( phonon ) heat bath(s ) .",
    "moreover , a proper overdamped limit of the langevin equation of motion in such an inhomogeneous medium is derived .",
    "a correct form of the corresponding fokker - planck equation is obtained and it is explicitly shown that neither of the two forms of the diffusion equation mentioned above [ eq.(1 ) ] is correct . from this macroscopic equation of motion one obtains an expression for the average current which depends on the details of the potential field and the inhomogeneities of the system .    as mentioned earlier",
    ", the nonuniformity of diffusion coefficient can arise either because of the space dependence of the friction coefficient @xmath16 or that of the temperature @xmath17 or because of both[40.44 ] .",
    "we , however , discuss possibilities of macroscopic current flow as a result of various kind of inhomogeneities in a symmetric periodic potential system .",
    "the first case we consider is when @xmath16 and @xmath17 are space dependent . by taking @xmath16 and",
    "@xmath17 periodic one gets a tilt in the potential field throughout the sample as discussed phenomenologically in ref.[20 ] , resulting in a macroscopic current because of thermal fluctuations . in this case",
    "the temperature inhomogeneity is crucial and one can obtain current even when the friction coefficient becomes uniform .",
    "friction coefficient inhomogeneity alone , however , does not generate macroscopic current . in the second case",
    ", we consider a thermal particle in a system with space dependent friction coefficient but subjected to external white noise fluctuations , and in the third case a thermal particle subjected to external space dependent white noise is considered .",
    "we then discuss the case of a brownian particle coupled to two thermal baths .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in all the cases that we have considered do not require the potential to be ratchetlike nor do we require the fluctuating forces to be correlated in time to obtain macroscopic current .",
    "finally we discuss the noise induced currents , their efficiency and the phenomenon of multiple current reversals in rocked frictional ratchets .",
    "in section 2 we provide a derivation of the macroscopic equation of motion in an inhomogeneous system from a microscopic hamiltonian of a brownian particle interacting with a ( phonon ) heat bath .",
    "we , then , obtain proper smoluchowski equation from the derived langevin equation of motion following the prescription of sancho et al [ 45 ] .",
    "we use , in sec.3 , this overdamped equation of motion in an inhomogeneous system with space dependent friction coefficient and nonuniform temperature field to obtain nonzero macroscopic current . in the same section",
    "we elaborate three other possible cases of inhomogeneous systems where macroscopic current could be possible .",
    "the section 4 is devoted to ac driven frictional ratchets and 5 for discussions .",
    "we consider an inhomogeneous system where the inhomogeneity could arise either because of the space dependence of friction coefficient , or the nonuniformity of the temperature field or because of the combined effect of both .",
    "the effect of the nonuniformity of temperature or temperature gradient , however , can not be incorporated as a potential term in the hamiltonian formalism in sharp contrast to , for instance , the amenability of incorporation of electric field gradient in the hamiltonian of a charged particle .",
    "we , therefore , incorporate the effect of temperature inhomogeneity at the end directly into the equation of motion obtained from the microscopic hamiltonian suited to take care of the space dependence of the friction coefficient .",
    "we consider a ( subsystem ) brownian particle , of mass @xmath18 , described by a coordinate @xmath19 and momentum @xmath20 moving in a potential field @xmath21 of the system and being in contact with a thermal(phonon ) bath .",
    "the bath oscillators are described by coordinates @xmath22 , momenta @xmath23 and mass @xmath24 with characteristic frequencies @xmath25 .",
    "we consider the total hamiltonian[35 ] @xmath26,\\ ] ] the interaction of the subsystem with the thermal bath is through the linear ( in @xmath27 ) coupling term @xmath28 . from",
    "( 2 ) one obtains the following equations of motion .    q = ,    p = - v^(q)+ _ _ a^(q ) ,    q= ,    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the derivative of @xmath31 with respect to @xmath19 . after solving ( 3c ) and ( 3d ) for @xmath32 by using the method of laplace transform and substituting its value in ( 3b ) ,",
    "we obtain    q = ,    @xmath33 + a^{\\prime}(q ) \\sum_{\\alpha } \\frac{a(q_0 ) \\lambda^{2}_{\\alpha } } { m_\\alpha \\omega^{2}_\\alpha } \\cos(\\omega_\\alpha t ) .",

    "the second term in the right hand side of equation ( 4b ) depends on the momenta at all times previous to @xmath37 . at this stage markovian limit",
    "is imposed so that @xmath38 the equation ( 5 ) follows readily from the well known ohmic spectral density distribution for the bath oscillators , i.e. , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an upper cutoff frequency set by the oscillator spectrum of the thermal bath . the markovian approximation ( 5 )",
    "has the effect of neglecting the transient terms involving the initial coordinate @xmath34 , in the equation of motion , for long time behaviour [ 46 ] .",
    "in other words , the equation should well describe the motion of the brownian particle in time scales @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "the equation of motion thus assumes the form    q = ,    @xmath43 ^ 2{p } + a^{\\prime}(q)\\ f(t),\\ ] ]    where @xmath44.\\ ] ] the force @xmath45 is fluctuating in character because of the associated uncertainties in the initial conditions @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the bath variables .",
    "however , as the thermal bath is characterised by its temperature @xmath48 , the equilibrium distribution @xmath49 of bath variables is given by the boltzmannian form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the partition function .",
    "using equation ( 8a ) and ( 6 ) one can easily compute the statistical properties of the fluctuating force @xmath45 .",
    "it is gaussian with    f(t ) = 0 ,    and +    f(t)f(t^ ) = k_bt  g(t - t^ ) = 2k_bt(t - t^ ) .",
    "it should be noted that the effect of the interaction term @xmath28 in the hamiltonian ( 2 ) is to introduce a friction term and a fluctuating term @xmath45 in the equation of motion ( 7b ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath30=constant corresponds to a uniform friction coefficient .",
    "we redefine , @xmath52 ^ 2}\\eta = \\eta(q)$ ] and @xmath53 , and put @xmath54 , in ( 7 ) to obtain ,    q = p ,    p = - v^(q ) - ( q)p + f(t ) ,    with    f(t ) = 0 ,    and +    = 2 ( t - t^ ) .    from eqs.(9 )",
    "it follows that the derived langevin equation of motion ( 10b ) of a brownian particle , in a system with space dependent friction @xmath55 but at constant uniform temperature @xmath48 , is internally consistent and obeys fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "we now proceed to incorporate the effect of space dependence of temperature , in a thermally nonuniform system , into the langevin equation of motion by assuming that the brownian particle comes in contact with a continuous sequence of independent temperature baths as its coordinate @xmath27 changes in time .",
    "( for notational simplicity , we replace the coordinate @xmath19 and momenta @xmath20 by the corresponding lower case letters @xmath27 and @xmath56 , respectively , reserving @xmath20 for probability distribution . )",
    "we consider each space point @xmath27 of the system to be in equilibrium with a thermal bath characterised by temperature @xmath17 .",
    "also , it should be noted that one could take @xmath16 to be constant piecewise along @xmath27 , and in each piece of these @xmath27 segments eq.(10b ) would correspond to an equation of motion with the constant friction coefficient but with the same statistical character of @xmath45 ( 11a-11b ) in all @xmath27 intervals .",
    "let us discretise the system , for the sake of argument , into segments @xmath57 around @xmath27 and represent them by indices @xmath58 .",
    "let us further assume that each segment is connected to an independent thermal bath at temperature @xmath59 with corresponding random forces @xmath60 so that the equation of motion ( 10b ) , in the segment @xmath58 , will have the last term @xmath61 . as the two different segments @xmath58 and @xmath62 are each coupled to an independent temperature bath we have @xmath63 .",
    "because @xmath45 is @xmath64 correlated in time , as the particle evolves dynamically the fluctuation force @xmath60 experienced by the brownian particle while in the space segment @xmath58 at time @xmath37 will have no memory about the fluctuating force experienced by it at some previous time @xmath65 while in the space segment @xmath66 .",
    "the space - dependent index @xmath58 in @xmath60 , therefore , can be ignored and the equation of motion becomes local in time as well as in space .",
    "therefore , in the continuum limit , the stochastic equations of motion of the brownian particle , in an inhomogeneous medium with space dependent friction and nonuniform temperature , acquire the simple forms    q = p ,    p = - v^(q ) - ( q)p + f(t ) ,    with    f(t)f(t^ ) = 2 ( t - t^ ) .      from eq.(12b )",
    "one can readily write down the fokker - planck equation or the kramer s equation for the full probability distribution @xmath67 . however , in most of the practical situations the marginal probability distribution @xmath68 for the variable @xmath27 alone suffices to describe the motion of the brownian particle .",
    "this probability distribution @xmath68 can be obtained in the overdamped limit of the langevin equation ( 12b ) which is valid on time scales larger than the inverse friction @xmath69 .",
    "in other words in the overdamped case the fast variable , velocity @xmath0 , is eliminated from the equation of motion . in the case of homogeneous systems",
    "one simply puts @xmath70 in eq.(12b ) to obtain the overdamped langevin equation .",
    "however , in case of inhomogeneous systems , the above method of adiabatic elimination of fast variables does not work , and leads to unphysical equilibrium distribution .",
    "the proper prescription for the elimination of fast variables has been given in ref.[45 ] for systems with space dependent friction .",
    "the method retains all terms upto order @xmath69 and the resulting overdamped langevin equation yields physically valid equilibrium distribution .",
    "we , therefore , apply the same prescription to obtain the overdamped langevin equation of motion in an inhomogeneous system with space dependent friction @xmath16 and nonuniform temperature field @xmath17 .",
    "we obtain , @xmath71}^2 } \\left[t(q ) \\eta^{\\prime}(q ) + \\eta(q)t^{\\prime}(q ) \\right ] +   \\sqrt { \\frac{k_{b}t(q)}{\\eta(q)}}f(t),\\ ] ] with + @xmath72 using van kampen lemma[47 ] and the novikov s theorem[48 ] we obtain the corresponding fokker - planck equation as @xmath73.\\ ] ] eq.(15 ) is the smoluchowski equation for an overdamped brownian particle moving in an inhomogeneous system with space dependent friction and nonuniform temperature .",
    "it should be noted that eq.(15 ) gives the correct form of diffusion equation instead of either of the two forms mentioned in eqs.(1 ) .",
    "it is clear that the temperature and the friction coefficients influence the particle motion in a qualitatively different fashion and they can not be plugged together to get effective diffusion coefficient to satisfy either of the forms of eq.(1 ) . in the next section we discuss how the system inhomogeneity can help maintain a macroscopic unidirectional current .",
    "we consider inhomogeneous systems where the inhomogeneity could be an internal property of the system or it could be imposed externally . as mentioned earlier we consider four cases where macroscopic motion can be obtained .",
    "when the system is bounded at @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath75 as @xmath74 , the system attains steady ( stationary ) state with zero probability current .",
    "in such a situation , we can calculate the steady state probability distribution @xmath76 , from the smoluchowski equation ( 15 ) , by setting the probability current @xmath77\\ ] ] equal to zero , as @xmath78 where + @xmath79 + and _",
    "n _ is a normalization constant .",
    "it is very clear from the expression , eq.(18 ) , for @xmath80 ( effective or generalized potential ) that the peaks of @xmath76 are determined not by the minima of @xmath81 alone but are determined as a combined effect with @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath76 may even peak at positions which would be quite less likely to be populated in the stationary situations for uniform temperature , @xmath82 = @xmath48 condition . in this respect ,",
    "nonequilibrium situations appear strange .",
    "it is quite common in biological systems where , for example , otherwise less likely ion channels are , in some situations , found to be more active for ionic transport .",
    "recently such nonequilibrium behaviour in biological systems have been theoretically attributed to the effect of nonequilibrium fluctuations and the process has been termed as kinetic focusing[49 ] .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that the relative stability of two states of a system with nonuniform temperature field is not determined by the local function @xmath3 but by the entire pathway through a continuous sequence of intervening states between the two states under comparison .",
    "the temperature variation may modify the kinetics of these intervening states drastically and hence their contribution towards the relative stability will be substantial even when they are sparsely populated .",
    "for example , application of a localized heating at a point on the reaction coordinate lying between the lower energy minimum and potential energy barrier maximum can raise the relative population of the higher - lying energy minimum over that of a lower minimum given by usual boltzmann factor .",

    "it is obvious from the expression for @xmath64 that the phase difference @xmath96 , between @xmath3 and @xmath17 , alone determines the direction of current .",
    "the net unidirectional current remains nonzero ( finite ) except when @xmath96 is an integral multiple of @xmath15 ( @xmath97 corresponds to zero effective slope of the generalized potential ) .",
    "it should further be noted that the amplitude of variation of @xmath16 does not determine the direction of current but does affect the magnitude of current . a periodic variation of @xmath16 and @xmath3 but uniform @xmath17 will yield no unidirectional current .",

    "the periodic variation of temperature plays the crucial role and may yield current even when @xmath105 = constant .",
    "the dependence of current on @xmath96 alone can readily be observed from the fact that the effective potential @xmath106 shows a tilt(or finite slope ) in positive or in negative direction depending on the magnitude of @xmath96 .",
    "the transport arises because particles starting from the potential minima can climb the hot slope more easily than they can climb the cold slope , created by phase difference between the potential and temperature profile .",
    "thus transition rates from one value to another in the right direction is different from that in the left direction(@xmath96 breaks the symmetry between left and right transition rates ) .",

    "this phenomena of twice current reversal with temperature @xmath48 is the foremost feature in our model , previously unseen in any overdamped system . in this case",
    "@xmath96 has been chosen in such a manner so that current in the high temperature limit ( which is predominantly determined by frictional inhomogeneity than spatial asymmetry ) is opposite to pure spatially asymmetric case ( @xmath246 ) .",
    "this is the cause of second current reversal as seen for the @xmath247 case . the first current reversal being the effect of finite frequency driving and spatial asymmetry as discussed earlier . when the phase difference @xmath96 is such that the current due to space dependent friction alone is in the same direction as that of current due to potential asymmetry only , then we do not have current reversal in the adiabatic case as shown in fig  ( [ j - t]b ) where @xmath248 , though a _ single",
    "_ current reversal due to finite frequency drive may be present .",
    "in all the cases studied so far we have observed that the current reversal do not take place above a critical frequency @xmath249 of driving , which in turn depends sensitively on @xmath96 and other parameters in the problem .",
    "multiple current reversals can also be seen when the amplitude ( @xmath190 ) of the forcing term is varied in a suitable parameter regime of our system . in fig .",
    "[ j - a ] , the plot of @xmath62 versus @xmath190 is shown for different values of @xmath236 , keeping @xmath203 , @xmath96 and @xmath48 fixed at @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 respectively . for @xmath245 curve",
    ", we can see as many as four current reversals .",
    "for very large value of @xmath190 , the current asymptotically goes to a constant value @xmath253 , as was previously shown for the adiabatic case .",
    "it should be noted that in the same asymptotic regime current goes to zero in the absence of space dependent friction . as the asymptotic value of current depends on @xmath96 ,",
    "so we can choose it appropriately to make it positive or negative .",
    "in the present case , @xmath96 has been chosen such that the asymptotic current is negative which guarantees at least one current reversal irrespective of frequency .",
    "the oscillatory behaviour in the @xmath254 characteristics is the reminiscent of deterministic dynamics .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ j - a ] shows current reversal even for the deterministic case also .",
    "in addition it exhibits the interesting phenomena of current quantization and phase locking .",
    "this current quantization give rise to oscillatory behaviour due to broadening of the steps in presence of small thermal noise . on further increasing the temperature",
    "these oscillatory behaviour vanishes .    in fig  ( [ j - a2 ] )",
    "we have plotted @xmath62 versus @xmath190 for @xmath255 for various values of @xmath236 .",
    "there is no current reversal in the adiabatic regime . here",
    "@xmath96 has been chosen such that , the asymptotic current is in the same direction as that due to the spatial asymmetry of the potential ( i.e positive ) .",
    "hence no multiple current reversal can be seen in the nonadiabatic regime even though there is oscillatory behaviour .",
    "the only reversal at low value of @xmath190 is that of finite frequency drive as discussed previously .",
    "the observation of multiple current reversals can be attributed to a cooperative interplay between the spatial asymmetry of the potential , the friction inhomogeneity and the finite frequency drive .",
    "depending on the system parameters we may have multiple current reversal or no current reversal at all ( see fig .",
    "(  [ j - a ] and [ j - a2 ] ) ) .",
    "all the above results can be understood qualitatively .",
    "transport in a nonequilibrium periodic system has become , in recent times , a field of very active research .",
    "we have just tried , in the beginning of this work , only to enumerate various working ideas to build a plausible model of thermal ratchet .",
    "the brief enumeration is , of course , not complete .",
    "the models are being gradually refined and simplified to be close either to the experimental reality or to invent techniques to be useful in practice .",
    "transport in inhomogeneous nonequilibrium systems has attracted attention since long .",
    "we have presented in sec.2 a microscopic approach to obtain macroscopic equation of motion in such systems .    with the help of these equations in sec .",
    "3.1 we have considered a medium with space dependent temperature and friction and have discussed the origin of unidirectional current in these systems . in the situations considered , in sections 3.1 and 3.2 , the system is subjected to external white noise fluctuations violating the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . also , these two cases , in a sense , are physically equivalent to having a spatially varying temperature field as considered in section 3.1 . in section 3.4",
    "we have considered an inhomogeneous system under the action two thermal baths",
    ". this system acts like a carnot engine which extracts work by making use of two thermal baths being at different temperature .",
    "this model too in the limit of small friction field modulation amplitude corresponds to a spatially varying temperature field .",
    "these observations seem to suggest that the case of inhomogeneous systems with spatially varying temperature field provides a general paradigm to obtain macroscopic current and several variants considered to model fluctuation induced transport may fall in the same general class of problems as considered in section 3.1 . moreover in all our models to obtain unidirectional current we require external white noise fluctuations as opposed to various models for homogeneous systems where application of colored noise ( correlated noise ) is must . for example , earlier models of thermal ratchets driven by colored noise in a small correlation time expansion ( or in the unified colored noise approximation for arbitrary time ) become identical to a brownian particle moving in an inhomogeneous medium with space dependent diffusion coefficient [ 59 ] .",
    "the interesting idea of relative stability of states , which affects current , in the presence of temperature nonuniformity which is central to our treatment , however , has not received the attention it deserves in the area of nonequilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "we remark that we do not require the periodic potential field of the system to be ratchetlike nor do we require the fluctuating force to be a colored noise to obtain macroscopic current .",
    "thus we have put the problem of macroscopic unidirectional motion in nonequilibrium systems on a more general footing .    in sec .",
    "4 we have discussed the current rectification and their reversals in ac driven frictional ratchet both in adiabatic and in nonadiabatic regime . both spatially symmetric and asymmetric",
    "potential has been considered .",
    "we observe several novel and complex features arising due to the combined effect of asymmetry and inhomogeneous friction and finite frequency driving force .",
    "currents in the low temperature regime is mostly influenced by the asymmetry of the potential . at higher temperatures",
    "it is controlled by the modulation parameter @xmath203 of the friction coefficient .",
    "we find current reversal with temperature even when the forcing is adiabatic . in the presence of finite frequency ,",
    "twice current reversal occurs . as function of amplitude of the forcing term",
    "we observe multiple current reversals .",
    "current even reverses its sign in the adiabatic deterministic regime and exhibits intriguing feature like phase locking and current quantization .",
    "current reversals in ratchets are very sensitive to the nature of potential and system parameters .",
    "even the condition of current direction can not be readily predicted a priori .",
    "ratchets of different kind ( and there are as many as discussed by reimann [ 8 ] ) require different conditions for current reversals , which have been worked out in some limiting cases [ 8 ] . however , all ratchets exhibit great sensitivity to the form of underlying potential and its derivatives over the entire period ( see the introduction of [ 8 ] ) .",
    "for example , it has recently been shown [ 60 ] that by barrier subdivision of potential profile with an integer n number of modulations ( in a randomly rocked ratchet ) can lead to n-1 current reversals as a function of temperature . however , there is no universal rule to obtain current reversal .",
    "we expect that our analysis should be applicable for the motion of particle in porous media and for molecular motors where space dependent friction can arise due to the confinement of particles .",
    "we have briefly discussed the efficiency of energy conversion in these systems in the adiabatic limit .",
    "we have shown that efficiency for energy transduction can be maximised as a function of noise strength and temperature .",
    "this in itself is a interesting observation .",
    "however , in the case of asymmetric potential the temperature may or may not facilitate the energy conversion .",
    "some of our recent studies reveal that in nonadiabatic limit , efficiency of the system may be small or large compared to the adiabatic regime .",
    "this indicates that by going away from the quasi - static limit(adiabatic limit ) efficiency can be increased contrary to the behaviour for reversible engines . for heat engines at molecular levels(molecular motors )",
    "the generalisation of thermodynamic principles to nonequilibrium steady states is a subject of current interest[61 ] . in a recent work[32 ]",
    "it has been shown that in two state ratchet models(flashing ratchets ) mobility can take over the role of the potential .",
    "contrary to previous models even no microscopic forces(or potentials ) are involved in the transport mechanism .",
    "we further expect that several novel cooperative effects and quantum effects discussed in the introduction for homogeneous systems may lead to a rich variety of phenomenon in inhomogeneous systems .",
    "system inhomogeneities may further enhance our understanding of non - debye relaxation ( approach to equilibrium ) even in the absence of potential disorder .",
    "to conclude we expect that the further studies of dynamics of particles in inhomogeneous non equilibrium systems may lead to new concepts in thermodynamics and statistical physics .",
