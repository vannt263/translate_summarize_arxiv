    "we restrict our attention to attractive , or focusing , nonlinearities @xmath13 such that the dynamics described by ( [ nls1 ] ) is nonintegrable , free of wave collapse , and admits stable solitary  wave solutions .",

    "this prediction is in accord with previous theories@xcite , but the approach taken in @xcite is new , and provides a definite interpretation to the notion set forth in the earlier works that it is `` thermodynamically advantageous '' for the nls system to approach a coherent solitary wave structure that minimizes the hamiltonian subject to fixed particle number .",
    "the statistical theory also gives predictions for the particle number spectral density and the kinetic energy spectral density , at least for a finite  dimensional spectral truncation of the nls dynamics ( [ nls1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , it predicts an equipartition of kinetic energy among the small  scale fluctuations .    in the present work , we shall begin with a brief review of this statistical theory .",
    "the predictions of the statistical theory will then be compared in detail with the results of direct numerical simulations of the nls system .",
    "in addition , we will also closely examine the evolution of the particle number spectrum in our numerical simulations , as well as the dynamics ( of finite spectral approximations ) of the integrals @xmath26 ( here @xmath27 denotes the @xmath28th derivative with respect to the spatial variable ) .",
    "the statistical model , being strictly an equilibrium theory , does not give predictions concerning the finite time dynamics of these quantities .",

    "in addition , we will demonstrate that the integrals @xmath29 exhibit interesting power law growth in time , as suggested by the weak turbulence theory developed by pomeau@xcite .",
    "in order to develop a meaningful statistical theory , we begin by introducing a finite  dimensional approximation of the nls equation ( [ nls1 ] ) . to fix ideas and notation , we will consider the nls system with homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions on an interval @xmath30 of length @xmath31 .",
    "our methods can easily be modified to accommodate other boundary conditions , and we will consider below the predictions of the theory for periodic boundary conditions , as well .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath55 is , of course , an invariant of the dynamics . the truncated version of the particle number    @xmath56    is also conserved by the dynamics ( [ spectrunc ] ) .",

    "the hamiltonian system ( [ spectrunc ] ) satisfies the liouville property , which is to say that the measure @xmath58 is invariant under the dynamics @xcite .",

    "we now consider a macroscopic description in terms of a probability density @xmath59 on the @xmath48dimensional phase  space @xmath60 .",
    "we seek a probability density that describes the statistical equilibrium state for the truncated dynamics . in accord with standard statistical mechanics and information theoretic principles ,",

    "thus , we are obliged to consider an alternative statistical equilibrium description of the nls system based on constraints other than those that give rise to the canonical ensemble .",
    "the key to constructing an appropriate statistical model is based on the observation from numerical simulations that , for a large number of modes @xmath47 , in the long  time limit , the field @xmath70 decomposes into two essentially distinct components : a large  scale coherent structure , and small  scale radiation , or fluctuations .",
    "as time progresses , the amplitude of the fluctuations decreases , until eventually the contribution of the fluctuations to the particle number and the potential energy component of the hamiltonian becomes negligible compared to the contribution from the coherent state , so that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are determined almost entirely by the coherent structure .",
    "we have checked that this effect becomes even more pronounced when the resolution of the numerical simulations is improved ( i.e. , when the number of modes is increased with the length @xmath31 of the spatial interval fixed ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as the fluctuations exhibit rapid spatial variations , the amplitude of their gradient does not , in general , become negligible in the asymptotic time limit .",

    "we emphasize that ( [ vfh ] ) is a hypothesis used to construct our statistical theory , and not a conclusion drawn from the theory itself .",
    "an immediate consequence of the vanishing of fluctuations hypothesis is that for @xmath47 sufficiently large , the expectation @xmath82 of the particle number is determined almost entirely by the mean @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , the hypothesis ( [ vfh ] ) implies that for @xmath47 large , the expectation @xmath84 of the potential energy is well approximated by @xmath85 , which is the potential energy of the mean .",

    "obviously , the multiplier @xmath67 must be positive .",

    "the nonlinearity @xmath22 actually represents a nice compromise between the focusing effect and nonlinear interactions . for weaker nonlinearities ( such as the saturated ones ) , the interaction between modes is weak , and the time required to approach an asymptotic equilibrium state is quite long . on the other hand , for stronger nonlinearities , the solitary wave structures that emerge exhibit narrow peaks of large amplitude , and therefore , greater spatial resolution is required in the numerical simulations .    the numerical scheme that we use for solving ( [ snls ] ) is the well - known split - step fourier method for a given number @xmath47 of fourier modes . throughout the duration of the simulations , the relative error in the particle number is kept at less than @xmath148 percent , and the relative error in the hamiltonian is no greater than @xmath149 percent .",

    "the tendency of the solution of the nls system ( [ snls ] ) to approach the statistical equilibrium state is also captured in the evolution of the kinetic and potential energies ( see figure [ poten ] ) . while the sum of these two quantities , which is the hamiltonian , remains constant in time , we observe that the kinetic energy increases monotonically , and , consequently , the potential energy decreases monotonically as time goes on .",
    "the initial time period where these quantities evolve most rapidly ( say @xmath168 ) corresponds to the first two stages of the dynamics described above , in which the modulational instability creates an array of soliton - like structures which then coalesce into a single coherent soliton .",

    "note that the statistical equilibrium model does not provide predictions about the time evolution of the spectrum , because it is strictly an equilibrium theory .",

    "this suggests the following scenario for the spectrally truncated nls dynamics : as time increases , smaller and smaller scales are explored , until eventually all available modes are excited .",
    "however , at any given time after the coalescence process has ended , the system may be considered as being in statitistical equilibrium over all the modes that have been excited up to that point . defining @xmath258 to be the largest wave number that the system has reached up to time @xmath237",

    "but , using @xmath259 , we obtain the following estimate for the spectrum of the fluctuations at time @xmath237 :    @xmath262    for @xmath263 .",
    "the total particle number spectrum at time @xmath237 , of course , has to be taken as the sum of the spectrum corresponding to the large - scale coherent structure ( which decreases exponentially for large k ) and the spectrum of the fluctuations .",
    "we emphasize that the derivation of the equation ( [ fluctspect ] ) describing the particle number spectrum at an intermediate time @xmath237 crucially depends on the assumption that the system evolves in such a way that it is nearly in statistical equilibrium over all the modes that have been investigated up to that time .",
    "the figure ( [ inter ] ) has motivated us to make this assumption , but clearly further numerical investigations should be carried out in order to test the validity of this hypothesis , as well as the accuracy of the formula ( [ fluctspect ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we find it quite interesting that the fluctuation spectrum ( [ fluctspect ] ) agrees with the prediction in @xcite , which was derived from a dimensional analysis of the weak turbulence equations for the nls system .",
    "the primary purpose of the present work has been to test the predictions of a mean  field statistical model of self - organization in a generic class of nonintegrable focusing nls equations defined by eqn .",
    "( [ nls1 ] ) . this statistical theory , which has been summarized above , was originally developed and analyzed in @xcite . in fact , we have demonstrated a remarkable agreement between the predictions of the statistical theory and the results of direct numerical simulations of the nls system .",
    "there is a strong qualitative and quantitative agreement between the mean field predicted by the statistical theory and the large - scale coherent structure observed in the long - time numerical simulations .",
    "in addition , the statistical model accurately predicts the the long - time spectrum of the numerical solution of the nls system .",
    "the main conclusions we have reached are 1 ) the coherent structure that emerges in the asymptotic time limit is the solitary wave that minimizes the system hamiltonian subject to the particle number constraint @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the given ( conserved ) value of @xmath152 , and 2 ) the difference between the conserved hamiltonian and the hamiltonian of the coherent state resides in gaussian fluctuations equipartitioned over wavenumbers .",
    "while the statistical model we have developed is an equilibrium theory , and , strictly speaking , only provides predictions concerning the long - time statistical properties of the nls system , we have combined this theory with insight gained from numerical simulations to paint a picture of the nature of the dynamics leading up to the statistical equilibrium state .",
    "specifically , the simulations ( and , in particular , the results shown in fig .  [ inter ] ) indicate that evolution is such that , at a given time after the coarsening process has ended , the system is nearly in statistical equilibrium over all the modes that have been excited by that time . from this observation",
    "the fact that the quantities @xmath29 defined in ( [ sm ] ) are seen to exhibit the power law growth in time according to eqn .",
    "( [ power ] ) , we have arrived at the prediction ( [ fluctspect ] ) for the time  dependence of the spectrum of the fluctuations . as we have mentioned above , results such as ( [ power ] ) and ( [ fluctspect ] ) have previously been derived by pomeau @xcite from weak turbulence arguments , but for the defocusing cubic nls equation in a bounded two - dimensional spatial domain .",
    "we believe that it would be an interesting exercise to check whether these formulas can be derived directly from a weak turbulence analysis in the present context that is , for 1d nonintegrable focusing nls equations in the absence of collapse .",
    "we would like to point out certain analogies between the dynamics of the nls systems we have considered here , and the dynamics of a turbulent 2d navier - stokes fluid .",
    "a prominent feature of large reynolds number 2d navier - stokes turbulence is the formation of quasisteady coherent vortex structures @xcite .",
    "starting from generic initial conditions , the evolution of the fluid is characterized by the formation of a collection of large - scale vortices , and the subsequent merger or coalescence of like - signed vortices @xcite .",
    "the large - scale soliton structures in ( focusing , nonintegrable ) nls play a role similar to that of the vortices in 2d navier - stokes turbulence .",
    "indeed , we have observed in our numerical simulations of nls the formation of an array of soliton - like structures which eventually coalesce into a single persistent soliton of large amplitude .",
    "another characteristic feature of turbulence in two - dimensions is the presence of a dual cascade @xcite .",
    "there is a direct cascade of enstrophy to small scales and an inverse cascade of energy to large scales .",
    "as pointed out long ago by kraichnan @xcite , the existence of the inverse cascade of energy is indicative of the formation of a large - scale structure in the system . in nls",
    ", there is also a dual cascade . indeed , our numerical simulations , which correspond to injecting as initial conditions particle number and energy at a given scale @xmath264 associated with the modulational instability , have revealed that their is a direct transfer of kinetic energy to spatial scales smaller than @xmath264 , while the particle number is transferred to large scales .",
    "while the 1d nls equation is much simpler system to investigate , both analytically and numerically , than a turbulent 2d fluid system , we believe that the understanding of the coalescence and transfer processes in this generic model of nonlinear wave turbulence might provide important insight into the nature of turbulent systems in general .",
