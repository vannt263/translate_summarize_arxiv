    "cosmological observations are necessarily carried out on a null hypersurface or a light - cone . at low redshifts ( @xmath3 ) , this can be regarded as to provide information on the constant - time hypersurface ( @xmath4 ) which is a quite conventional implicit approximation underlying cosmological studies using the galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "when the depth of the survey volume exceeds @xmath5 , however , this approximation breaks down , and one should simultaneously take account of the intrinsic evolution of galaxy clustering and the light - cone effect in addition to any other selection effect in interpreting the data .",
    "this is indeed the case for the on - going wide - field surveys of galaxies including 2df ( 2-degree field survey ) and sdss ( sloan digital sky survey ) .    to our knowledge",
    ", the first quantitative consideration of the light - cone effect is made by nakamura , matsubara , & suto ( 1998 ) who derived the systematic bias in the estimate of @xmath6 from magnitude - limited surveys of galaxies combining the cosmological redshift distortion effect ( matsubara & suto 1996 ) and the evolution of galaxy clustering within the survey volume . in this paper",
    ", we examine the light - cone effect on higher - order statistics of galaxy clustering , considering counts - in - cells analysis specifically .",
    "let us consider first the higher - order statistics on the idealistic constant - time hypersurface .",
    "denote the volume averaged @xmath7-th order correlation functions at a redshift @xmath8 by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the comoving smoothing length , and introduce the normalized higher - order moments @xmath11^{n-1}$ ] .",
    "the hierarchical clustering ansatz states that @xmath12 is constant and independent of the scale @xmath10 .",
    "this is a good approximation in nonlinear regimes , although small but definite scale - dependence is clearly detected from n - body experiments ( lahav et al .",
    "1993 ; suto 1993 ; matsubara & suto 1994 ; suto & matsubara 1994 ; jing & brner 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , perturbation theory predicts that @xmath9 evolves in proportion to @xmath13^{n-1}$ ] , and therefore @xmath12 is independent of time , i.e. it is constant with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "the next section describes the general theory of the light cone effect on @xmath12 defined above . using the ansatz by jain , mo , & white ( 1995 ; hereafter jmw ) ,  3 evaluates the appropriate correction in an array of cold dark matter ( cdm ) models . finally , ",
    "4 summarizes the results and discusses the implications for redshift surveys .",
    "it is difficult to estimate @xmath9 observationally since @xmath8 is changing over the volume of galaxy sample .",
    "while in principle one could measure the @xmath7-point functions on @xmath14 surfaces , in practice this would result in a diminished volume , thus a significant increase of the errors .",
    "instead it is more practical to extract the following @xmath7-th order correlation functions averaged over the volumes on the light - cone : @xmath15 in the above expression , we assume that the observation is performed with the fixed solid angle , and the sampling cells for the analysis are placed randomly in @xmath8-coordinate with @xmath16 being their weighting function . if the cells were located randomly in the comoving coordinates , the volume element @xmath17 should have been replaced by @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the angular diameter distance ; see , nakamura et al .",
    "1998 ) and thus the procedure itself becomes dependent on adopted values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in principle @xmath16 is an arbitrary function , and should be determined so as to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio given the selection function of individual observation . by @xmath22",
    "we denote the redshift corresponding to the depth of the survey . for a volume - limited sample , for instance",
    ", it is natural to set @xmath23 and @xmath22 as the maximum redshift of the sample .",
    "similarly we define the ( observable ) higher - order moments averaged over the light - cone as @xmath24^{n-1 } } .",
    "\\label{eq : snzm}\\ ] ] it is useful to introduce the function @xmath25 which describes the evolution of the averaged two - point correlation function : @xmath26 in linear regime , @xmath25 is equivalent to @xmath27 ^ 2 $ ] where @xmath28 is the linear growth rate . although the above relation ( [ eq : gz ] ) does not exactly hold in the nonlinear regime , several approximation formulae are derived in the literature , which empirically describe the evolution by allowing @xmath25 depend on the scale @xmath10 ( see  3 for details ) .",
    "once we accept the evolution law ( [ eq : gz ] ) , equation ( [ eq : snzm ] ) is explicitly written as @xmath29^{n-2 } }   { \\displaystyle \\left[\\int_0^{{z_{\\rm max } } } z^2 dz ~w(z ) g(z)\\right]^{n-1 } } .",
    "\\label{eq : m4}\\ ] ] if @xmath30 , the above expression is expanded in terms of @xmath22 as follows : @xmath31 { z_{\\rm max}}^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad + \\ ;   { \\cal o}({z_{\\rm max}}^3 ) , \\label{eq : m5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 denotes @xmath33 and so on .",
    "the above expansion up to @xmath34 is valid as long as the weighting function is well - approximated up to the same order : @xmath35 in other words , @xmath22 should be set to be smaller than the effective window size of @xmath36 .",
    "it is interesting to note that up to @xmath34 equation ( [ eq : m5 ] ) is independent of @xmath16 , and that @xmath37 term is determined only by @xmath32 independently of @xmath25 . since @xmath32 is expected to vanish in linear theory ( fry 1984 ; goroff et al .",
    "1986 ; bernardeau 1992 ) , and shown to be relatively small even in quasi- and fully- nonlinear regimes ( bouchet et al . 1992",
    "; lahav et al . 1993 ; colombi , bouchet , & hernquist 1995 ; szapudi et al .",
    "1997 ) , equation ( [ eq : m5 ] ) implies that the light - cone effect is very small for 2df and sdss galaxy redshift surveys ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that if galaxies are biased relative to the mass density field , @xmath32 may not be necessarily small .",
    "so any signal proportional to @xmath22 provides a clear indication of the time - dependent biasing of galaxies ( see e.g. , fry 1996 ; mo & white 1996 ; mo , jing & white 1997 ) .",
    "in order to evaluate the effect of observational average on the light - cone , we assume that @xmath12 does not evolve with @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath39 . as described above , this is a reasonable approximation as long as galaxies are unbiased tracers of underlying density field . if we introduce the measure of the light - cone effect : @xmath40 equations ( [ eq : m4 ] ) and ( [ eq : m5 ] ) with @xmath41 reduce to @xmath42 note that @xmath43 can be regarded as a correction factor as well , if one measures the @xmath44 s _ without _ considering the evolution of clustering .",
    "this constitutes a simple and practical method , which we propose for future measurements , when compensation for the light cone effect is required .    to evaluate equation ( [ eq : m4 ] ) , we need a model for @xmath25 . for this purpose",
    ", we adopt the ansatz originally put forward by hamilton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and improved later by peacock & dodds ( 1994 , 1996 ) and jmw . to be specific ,",
    "we apply the fitting formula by jmw which relates the evolved two - point correlation function @xmath45 with its linear counterpart @xmath46 as follows : @xmath47 , \\\\",
    "\\label{eq : jmwfit4 }   f(x ) & = & { x+0.45 x^2 -0.02 x^5 + 0.05 x^6 \\over 1 + 0.02 x^3 + 0.003 x^{9/2 } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equations , @xmath48 denotes a power - law index of the power spectrum , @xmath49^{1/3 } r$ ] , and @xmath50^{0.8}$ ] .",
    "jmw show that the above formula works reasonably well even for cdm models by replacing @xmath48 by the effective spectral index evaluated at the scale which is just entering nonlinear regime . in general",
    "the resulting @xmath48 depends on @xmath8 , which we neglect below for simplicity ; for galaxy surveys which we are primarily interested in , the @xmath8-dependence of @xmath48 near @xmath4 is expected to be very small .",
    "the inverse of equation ( [ eq : jmwfit1 ] ) is formally written as @xmath51 $ ] and jmw s empirical fit to @xmath52 is @xmath53 then @xmath45 is expressed explicitly in terms of @xmath54 : @xmath55            \\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : m12}\\ ] ] let us introduce a parameter @xmath56 $ ] which characterizes the variance on a scale @xmath10 at @xmath57 , and thus depends on @xmath20 and @xmath21 through the shape of the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "then the scale - dependent evolution factor @xmath58 in equation ( [ eq : gz ] ) is given by @xmath59 .",
    "\\label{eq : grz}\\ ] ] for the convenience of @xmath8-expansion , we calculate the derivatives of the above quantity at @xmath57 : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "the above expressions indicate how the light - cone effect depends on @xmath20 and @xmath21 at @xmath30 .",
    "note , that they are involved in @xmath34 term and thus do not contribute significantly at small @xmath8 .",
    "using equations ( [ eq : m4 ] ) and ( [ eq : grz ] ) and assuming @xmath63 , we can evaluate the evolutionary effect on @xmath64 or @xmath65 . as examples , we consider three representative cdm models ( table 1 ) whose fluctuation amplitude @xmath66 is normalized so as to reproduce the abundances of clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , kitayama & suto 1997 ; kitayama , sasaki & suto 1997 ) .",
    "the results are displayed on a series of figures .",
    "figure [ fig : ar ] shows how @xmath67 is related to the comoving smoothing length @xmath10 in these models .",
    "figure [ fig : dnz ] displays @xmath68 as a function of @xmath8 , and finally figure [ fig : dnr ] plots @xmath68 against @xmath10 .",
    "the general appearance of the figures suggests that the light - cone effect is a fairly robust feature , although its details depend on the model . in all cases scdm appears to give the strongest effect , while for ocdm and lcdm it is slightly less pronounced .",
    "nevertheless the difference is fairly small and qualitatively all models behave similarly .",
    "note also , that the magnitude of the correction depends on the order @xmath7 , and , in accord with intuition , it is monotonically increasing for higher order .",
    "as expected , the light - cone effect becomes larger as @xmath22 increases , which can be seen in figure [ fig : dnz ] .",
    "although the correction is relatively small for shallow surveys with @xmath69 samples , @xmath70 becomes @xmath71% in nonlinear scales ( @xmath72 ) . in scdm , for instance , @xmath70 exceeds unity for @xmath73 for the entire dynamic range plotted .",
    "furthermore figure [ fig : dnr ] indicates that even if the hierarchical ansatz is correct , i.e. , @xmath12 is independent of @xmath10 , the light - cone effect should generate apparent scale - dependence , since the correction behaves differently at different scales at a given redshift .",
    "the future sdss will be able to measure the moments of the galaxy density field with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "unless unforeseen systematics exists , it will determine them with less than a few percent error for @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath76 between @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( see colombi , szapudi , & szalay 1997 for details ) . according to figures [ fig : dnz ] and [ fig : dnr ]",
    ", the light cone effect will be much smaller than these errors , or at most of the same order , depending on the scales and models",
    ". the correction could be potentially non - negligible only at the smallest scales .",
    "a similar conclusion can probably be drawn about the 2df survey .",
    "on the other hands , for future deep surveys , which should aim at smaller scales especially if carried out by the next - generation space telescope , our calculations will be of utmost importance . according to figure [ fig : dnr ] the required correction can range from up to unity for @xmath79 through factors of few for @xmath80 to factors of hundred for @xmath81 .",
