    "the study at the @xmath67 collider hera of exclusive diffractive processes in the presence of a hard scale has provided insight into the parton dynamics of the diffractive exchange .",
    "the four - momentum squared transferred at the proton vertex , @xmath4 , provides a relevant scale to investigate the application of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) for @xmath68 @xcite . in this letter , the first measurement at large @xmath4 ( @xmath69  gev@xmath70 ) of diffractive photon - proton scattering , @xmath71 , where @xmath1 is the proton dissociative system , is presented .",
    "the measurement is performed at hera by studying the reaction @xmath72 in the photoproduction regime with a large rapidity gap between the final state photon and the proton dissociative system  @xmath1 ( as illustrated in figure [ fig : photondiag]a ) .",

    "this process constitutes an extension of deeply virtual compton scattering  @xcite into the large @xmath7 and small @xmath74 regime .",
    "diffractive photon scattering can be modelled in the proton rest frame by the fluctuation of the incoming photon into a @xmath75 pair at a long distance from the proton target .",
    "the @xmath75 pair is then involved in a hard interaction with the proton via the exchange of a colour singlet state . in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla )",
    ", the colour singlet exchange is modelled by the effective exchange of a gluon ladder ( figure [ fig : photondiag]b ) . for sufficiently low values of bjorken @xmath76 ( i.e.  large values of @xmath3 ) ,",
    "the bfkl @xcite approach is expected to be appropriate for describing the gluon ladder . in the lla bfkl model the gluon ladder couples to a single parton ( predominantly a gluon ) within the proton .",
    "the cross section depends therefore linearly on the parton distribution in the proton . due to the quasi - real nature of the incoming photon ( @xmath2 )",
    ", the transverse momentum of the final state photon , @xmath77 , is entirely transferred by the gluon ladder to the parton in the proton .",
    "the separation in rapidity between the parton scattered by the gluon ladder and the final state photon is given by @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the invariant mass of the system formed by the incoming photon and the struck parton .",
    "the proton remnant and the struck parton hadronise through fragmentation processes to form the hadronic system  @xmath1 . assuming parton - hadron duality , hadrons originating from the struck parton correspond to the particles with the largest transverse momenta and hence are the closest in rapidity to the scattered photon .",

    "the measured @xmath3 and @xmath4 dependences of their cross sections were found to be in agreement with lla bfkl based calculations @xcite . for the process studied here , theoretical calculations are simplified by the absence of a vector meson wave function : the only non - perturbative part of the calculation is the parton distribution functions of the proton . however , the cross section is suppressed relative to that of vector meson production by the electromagnetic coupling of the @xmath82 pair to the final state photon , making the measurement more challenging .",

    "a good description of the @xmath3 dependence of the cross section is found , whereas the lla bfkl model predicts a @xmath7 dependence that is too soft and hence unable to describe the data .",
