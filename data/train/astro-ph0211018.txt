    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) collides ultra - relativistic ions at energies up to 200 gev per nucleon .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon reactions are energetic enough that perturbative qcd is expected to be able to describe much of the collision dynamics .",
    "the goal of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions is to study the properties of matter at extremely high temperatures and/or densities , with an eye to mimicing the conditions present in the very early universe , @xmath0 10@xmath1s after the big bang .",
    "a specific goal is to look for the quark - gluon plasma , a state of matter whereby the protons and neutrons in a nucleus dissolve , producing a gas of free quarks and gluons .",
    "these collisions may also be similar to those produced when heavy - ion cosmic rays hit the atmosphere . in the target frame ,",
    "rhic projectile gold nuclei have a total energy of 4.3 pev ( 20 tev per nucleon ) , energetically reaching the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "relativistic heavy ion collisions were initially studied at the berkeley bevatron , sis and the dubna nuclotron@xcite .",
    "more recently , there have been higher energy studies at the bnl ags and the cern sps .",
    "the sps data is often used as a lower - energy comparison point ; the sps collided lead on lead , at a center of mass energy of 17 gev per nucleon .",
    "the earlier studies found several interesting phenomena .",
    "these include :    anisotropic flow : heavy ion collisions may be described at least partly in terms of fluid dynamics ; the system shows fluidlike behavior@xcite .",

    "the latter two observations have been proposed as signatures of the quark gluon plasma .",
    "however , both phenomena might be due to normal hadronic interactions , with the additional strangeness produced in secondary reactions among the produced hadrons , and the j/@xmath3 suppression due to interactions with the initial state nucleons and the other hadrons produced in the collision .    in low energy heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the interacting baryons stop when the nuclei collide . as the collision energy increases ,",
    "the nuclei gradually become transparent , the baryons retain some of their initial momentum , and the net baryon density of the produced system drops . at rhic , the net baryon density at mid - rapidity ( near the system center of mass ) should be near zero .",
    "this writeup will discuss heavy ion collisions at rhic , starting with observables that probe thermal freezeout , such as the global event characteristics , system size , particle spectra , and non - isotropic flow .",
    "next , the composition at chemical freezeout will be discussed , followed by signatures of the early evolution , focusing on high @xmath4 particles and charm production .",
    "rhic is a 3.8 km circumference double - ring accelerator which can collide gold ions at center of mass energies of up to 200 gev / nucleon at a luminosity of @xmath5@xmath6s , corresponding to about 1,500 hadronic collisions / sec .",
    "rhic can also accelerate lighter ions .",
    "the maximum energy per nucleon depends on the charge to mass ratio ; for protons , the maximum center of mass energy is 500 gev .",
    "it also collides polarized protons , to study the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "the luminosity depends on the species ; for protons the luminosity can reach @xmath7/@xmath8/s , or about 700,000 hadronic interactions / sec .    in the year 2000 , rhic collided gold nuclei at an energy of 130 gev / nucleon .",
    "most of the results presented here are from this run . in 2001/2",
    ", rhic collided gold nuclei at 200 gev / nucleon , briefly reaching the design luminosity , and collided polarized protons , with up to 25% polarization .",
    "the long term program will include studies with lighter ions , gold - gold collisions at lower energies , and deuterium - gold and/or proton - gold collisions .",
    "rhic is instrumented with two large detectors , star and phenix , and two smaller experiments , brahms and phobos . a third small experiment , @xmath9 , studies proton - proton elastic scattering@xcite .",
    "the collaborations have very different strategies for studying ion collisions .",
    "phenix is designed to look for relatively rare observables that are sensitive to the early phases of the collision , such as charmed hadrons , @xmath10 and direct photons@xcite .",
    "the detectors are optimized for particle identification , especially leptons and photons .",
    "phenix has a two - armed central spectrometer ; each arm is instrumented with charged particle tracking , time - of - flight ( tof ) , a ring imaging cherenkov counter ( rich ) , and electromagnetic calorimetry .",

    "the zdcs are intended to provide a common method for luminosity and centrality ( impact parameter ) measurements , in order to facilitate comparisons between the four experiments .",
    "before discussing central collisions , it is interesting to consider ultra - peripheral collisions ( upcs ) , interactions at large impact parameters @xmath24 ( minimum ion - ion separation ) where only photonuclear and two - photon interactions are possible",
    ". upcs can probe a wide variety of physics@xcite , ranging from electrodynamics in very strong electromagnetic fields to meson spectroscopy to measurements of gluon shadowing in heavy nuclei to tests of quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "photoproduction of heavy hadrons@xcite and quarkonium@xcite is sensitive to the gluon density in the nucleus , and hence to gluon shadowing .    at rhic , mutual nuclear excitation ( including both coulombic and hadronic interactions ) is used as a luminosity monitor@xcite .",
    "the process has a large cross section , about 11 barns , and small backgrounds .",
    "one easily observable upc process is exclusive coherent photoproduction of vector mesons , @xmath25 .",
    "these events are characterized by an almost empty detector , containing only two tracks , with a total event transverse momentum @xmath26 mev / c .",
    "the low @xmath4 , characteristic of the coherent photon emission and scattering , is a distinctive signature , as data from star shows in fig .",
    "[ fig : pcpt ] . at 130 gev , star measures @xmath27 mb@xcite , in agreement with theoretical predictions@xcite .",
    "the ratio of @xmath28 to direct @xmath29 production is consistent with that measured in @xmath30 interactions .",
    "hadronic collisions occur in several stages , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ initschematic ] . the nucleons collide , and their partons interact .",
    "the produced particles interact and form hadrons ( hadronize ) . as the interactions continue and the number of particles grows , the system expands and cools , when the average particle energy is low enough , inelastic hadron production stops , a transition known as chemical freezeout .",
    "slightly later , the interparticle separation is large enough that even elastic interactions cease ; this is thermal freezeout .",
    "the key question in this picture is whether the produced particles interact as hadrons ( i.e. a hadron gas ) or as partons ( i.e. , a quark - gluon plasma ) .",
    "partons produced in the initial interactions may remain free for long enough to interact with each other and equilibrate , forming a quark - gluon plasma . or",
    ", they might immediately form hadrons ( hadronize ) , and the interacting system will be a hadron gas . or , they could initial interact as a quark - gluon plasma , and , then , as the system cools , hadronize to form a hadron gas .",
    "most of the theoretical guidance regarding the quark - gluon plasma comes from lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) .",
    "recent lgt calculations indicate that the phase transition between hadron gas and quark - gluon plasma , if it occurs , is weak ( at least second order ) , and occurs at a temperature of 150 - 200 mev and an energy density @xmath31 gev/@xmath32@xcite .",
    "this calculation is for an infinite medium with an infinite lifetime ; edge effects and formation time are not considered .",
    "although the expected system lifetime is only @xmath33s , calculations indicate that equilibration occurs quickly , so a clear phase change is possible .",
    "although it is a key parameter in heavy ion collisions , the impact parameter @xmath24 is not directly observable .",
    "we use two classes of observables to infer the impact parameter .",
    "the first is the number of forward ( zero - degree ) neutrons .",
    "these neutrons come from the non - interacting part of the nucleus .",
    "enough energy propagates from the initial collision to dissociate the non - interacting part of the nuclei into neutrons , protons and small nuclear fragments .",
    "the other observables are sensitive to the number of interacting nucleons .",
    "examples are the charged particle multiplicity or transverse energy .",
    "a model is necessary to relate these observables to the impact parameter . to avoid systematic uncertainties ,",
    "events are often sorted by centrality ( _ i.e. _ by charged multiplicity ) , and divided into classes , such as the 10% most central ( those with the smallest impact parameter ) .",
    "figure [ fig : phenixmult ] shows the relationship between the number of forward neutrons ( measured in the zdcs ) and the charged multiplicity@xcite .",
    "the charged multiplicity rises continually as the impact parameter decreases .",
    "however , the number of forward neutrons is largest at moderate impact parameters . in very central collisions ,",
    "most of the nucleus interacts , leaving few remnant neutrons , while in very peripheral collisions , some of the nucleus remains intact , reducing the number of forward neutrons , producing the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : phenixmult ] .",
    "the particles present at thermal freezeout are those observed in the rhic detectors , and are relevant for comparison with models of heavy ion collisions . the charged particle multiplicity is shown as a function of pseudorapidity @xmath34 in fig .",
    "[ phobosdndy ] .",
    "the multiplicity @xmath35 is roughly flat for @xmath36 .",
    "this central plateau shows that there is boost invariance . within this region",
    ", the system appears invariant with respect to the longitudinal boost ( velocity ) ; the expansion may be treated in 2 dimensions .    at 130 gev",
    ", the maximum @xmath35 is about 570 , rising to @xmath37 at 200 gev .",
    "this corresponds to total multiplicities of about @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively@xcite .",
    "these multiplicities are considerably lower than most pre - rhic predictions@xcite , and seem to be best fit by models based on a combination of hard interactions ( calculated by perturbative qcd ) and soft interactions ( extrapolated from lower energies ) .",
    "most popular cosmic ray air shower codes predict considerably larger multiplicities@xcite .",
    "the @xmath40 per participant ( nucleon involved in the collision ) are about 40% higher than at lower energies , and also 50% higher than in @xmath41 collisions at comparable energies@xcite .",
    "the multiplicity per participant rises smoothly as the number of participants increases .",
    "the phenix collaboration measured a transverse energy @xmath42 gev per unit @xmath34 for the 2% most central collisions .",
    "this is the energy released in the collision . in a boost - invariant picture ( supported by the existence of a central plateau ) , particles emitted into a pseudorapidity region @xmath43 cine from a region of longitudinal size @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the time required for the initial interactions to occur . here , @xmath46 is the energy scale for the initial particle production .",
    "the initial energy density depends on this scale .",
    "we will use a conservative @xmath47 mev / c , so @xmath48 fm / c .",
    "the initial volume is @xmath49 and the energy density @xmath50 is @xmath51 this is much larger than the 1 gev/@xmath52 that lattice gauge calculations predict is required to form a qgp .",
    "although the time scale is not completely fixed , it seems hard to stretch @xmath53 enough to reduce @xmath50 below 1 gev/@xmath52 .",
    "the baryon : antibaryon ratio at freezeout is also of interest .",
    "some baryons are initially present in the gold nuclei , while the rest are produced via baryon - antibaryon pair production .",
    "antibaryons come only from the latter source . at 130 gev ,",
    "the @xmath54 ratio is @xmath55 , rising to @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 where the first ( usually only ) error is statistical@xcite .",
    "these ratios are quite close to 1 .",
    "the central region is nearly baryon free .",
    "pair produced baryons outnumber initial state baryons by more than 2:1 .",
    "however , the net baryon number is not zero , showing that there is indeed substantial baryon stopping ; many initial state baryons are transported over 6 units of rapidity .",
    "the size of the system at thermal freezeout has been measured with 2-particle interferometry ( hanbury - brown twiss interferometry ) , taking advantage of the bose statistics that increase the abundance of particle pairs with momentum difference @xmath60 . here",
    "@xmath61 is the radius of the last elastic interaction .",
    "the momentum difference vector is decomposed into longitudinal ( along the beam direction ) , side ( transverse to the observer , and out ( toward the observer ) components ( the bertsch - pratt decomposition ) .",
    "the source radius for a source with an assumed gaussian is about 6 fermi in all 3 dimensions@xcite .",
    "this is about twice the initial nuclear radius ( about 6.5 fermi , in a woods - saxon [ almost hard sphere ] density distribution ) .",
    "this source size is similar to that observed in much lower energy collisions at the sps ; the lack of growth is a surprise .",
    "it is also surprising that the source radii in all 3 dimensions are similar ; this indicates that the particles are emitted in a very short time scale , _",
    "i.e. _ that thermal freezeout occurs quite suddenly over the entire nucleus .",
    "finally , we can compare the charged pion , proton and kaon spectra .",
    "for @xmath62 gev / c ( the non - perturbative region ) , all three spectra are consistent with thermal emission . however , the three species have rather different apparent temperatures .",
    "the different temperatures may be due to a collective outward motion known as radial flow .",
    "if the expanding particles interact strongly , they tend to move outward at the same velocities .",
    "then , the thermal fit temperature @xmath63 for a particle with mass @xmath64 is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the actual temperature and @xmath67 is the collective expansion velocity .",
    "the 3 species satisfy eq .",
    "[ eq : thermal ] for @xmath68 mev and @xmath69@xcite .",
    "the system expands outward at more than half the speed of light ! as fig .",
    "[ fig : thermal ] shows , the temperature is slightly lower than that measured at the sps , but @xmath70 is significantly higher .",
    "the temperature is comparable to the transition temperature predicted by lgt calculations .",
    "the very large @xmath70 is characteristic of explosive expansion , with very high pressures and strong rescattering .",
    "anisotropic flow is another observable . in a non - central collision",
    ", the reaction zone is elliptical .",
    "pressure converts this spatial asymmetry into a particle density / momentum anisotropy which is usually parameterized as @xmath71 where @xmath72 the angle between the particle and the reaction plane ( impact parameter vector ) , and @xmath73 is the elliptic flow .",
    "a large @xmath73 indicates high pressures and early equilibration@xcite .",
    "figure [ starflow ] shows the elliptic flow as a function of centrality , here given in terms of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the charged particle multiplicity relative to the maximum multiplicity @xmath76 .",
    "the flow is large , and is very close to the predictions of hydrodynamic models that treat the system as a fluid .",
    "flow has been studied for identified pions , protons and kaons ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) , and @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath4 dependence of these species flow matches the predictions of hydrodynamic models quite well@xcite .",
    "this fluidlike behavior is another indication of a strongly interacting system .",
    "a key observable of chemical freezeout are the abundances of various particles .",
    "if the system is in chemical equilibrium , the abundances should scale as @xmath79/kt)}$ ] , where @xmath64 is the particle mass , @xmath1 is the chemical potential of the particle ( due to it s baryon and strangeness content ) , @xmath80 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath66 is the temperature@xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : chemical ] compares the ratios of a number of different particles , compared with the thermal model predictions .",
    "the fit finds temperature @xmath81 mev , baryochemical potential @xmath82 mev , strange chemical potential @xmath83 mev , and strangeness suppression factor @xmath84 . this is hotter than at thermal freezeout , which is a later , cooler stage in the evolution of the system .",
    "the @xmath85 is much less than the proton mass , showing quantitatively that the central region is effectively net baryon free .",
    "the chemical equilibration of hadrons containing up , down and strange quarks ( @xmath86 ) is very different from the situation in @xmath87 , @xmath2 and @xmath88 collisions . in these elementary collisions ,",
    "@xmath89 ; strange hadrons are suppressed by a factor of 3 below the equilibrium expectations .",
    "this strangeness equilibration was long - ago proposed as a signature of the quark - gluon plasma . in a qgp , reactions proceed quickly , and equilibrium should be reached rapidly .",
    "reactions are much slower in a hadron gas and there are many species to produce , so equilibration takes much longer .",
    "most ( but not all ) calculations indicate that the hadron gas equilibration takes much longer than the expected system lifetime@xcite .",
    "study of the evolution of the system before chemical freezeout requires a probe particle that is created early in the collision .",
    "a few probes , such as direct photons escape the medium without interacting , and provide information about the process that created them .",
    "others , such as charmonium and high @xmath4 particles , interact with the medium and can provide information about how it evolves .",
    "these probes come from the hadronization of high @xmath4 quarks and gluons ( partons ) . as of this conference , rhic has so far only presented results on the high @xmath4 hadrons .",
    "high @xmath4 partons are produced very early in the collision , at a time @xmath91 .",
    "the partons are not expected to hadronize until much later , around a time @xmath92 , where @xmath93 mev is the typical qcd scale .",
    "usually , the partons will have exited the medium before this point , so that hadronization occurs in free space .",
    "the medium will interact with the produced parton , not the final state hadrons .",
    "since the final state hadron momenta depends on the parton momentum , any energy loss by the parton in the medium will be reflected in the high @xmath4 hadron spectrum .",
    "the parton energy loss can be studied by comparing hadron momentum spectra from central heavy ion collisions with spectra from peripheral heavy ion collisions and @xmath2 collisions . published results , using the 130 gev data , have used a @xmath2 reference spectrum derived from 200 gev @xmath88 collision data from the ua1 experiment .",
    "[ phenixhighpt]@xcite , compares charged hadron and @xmath94 production in central gold - gold collisions with a normalized @xmath2 spectrum .",
    "@xmath95 is the cross section ratio for gold - gold to @xmath2 collisions , divided by the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions in the gold . in the absence of nuclear effects ,",
    "@xmath96 . at low @xmath4 soft (",
    "non - perturbative ) physics is expected to dominate , leading to @xmath97 , as observed . however , at higher @xmath4 , where perturbative qcd applies well , we expect @xmath96 . in contrast , at high @xmath4 , in the data , @xmath95 flattens out at about 0.5 for charged hadrons , and 0.3 for @xmath94 .",
    "nuclear effects , such as shadowing , multiple scattering and the net isospin difference can affect @xmath95 . in @xmath98 collisions , the incident nucleons may undergo soft interactions and acquire some initial state @xmath4 before undergoing a hard interaction .",
    "known as the cronin effect , this initial - state @xmath4 may increase the final state @xmath4 and hence the measured r@xmath99 .",
    "[ phenixhighpt ] also shows @xmath95 from lead - lead collisions at a center of mass energy of 17 gev / nucleon .",
    "there , for @xmath100 gev , @xmath95 rises considerably above 1 .",
    "this is dramatically different from rhic , showing a significant effect of the higher energy .",
    "in fact , the lower energy data shows no energy loss , while the rhic data seems to indicate a very large energy loss@xcite .    the systematic errors in normalizing the ua1 and rhic data vary with the particle momentum , but are in the 35% range , due to uncertainties in luminosities , cross sections , centrality selection , pseudorapidity distribution , etc .",

    "the correlations observed in the @xmath2 collisions match the theoretical expectations , but the jet pair correlations are absent in the @xmath98 data    the major difference expected between @xmath2 and @xmath98 collisions is anisotropic flow ; the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ angcorr ] shows the size of the flow contribution .",
    "flow can not explain the difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath98 curves .",
    "the suppression of high @xmath4 particles , presence of same - side particle correlations and disappearance of opposite side particle correlations are all consistent with a strongly interacting system . only partons produced near the surface of the system are able to escape and produce jets . when a parton reaction produces back - to - back partons near the system surface , one parton escapes , almost unmodified , producing a jet .",
    "the other parton goes in the other direction , into the system , where it is absorbed .",
    "the large flow at high @xmath4 ( fig . [ starflow ] ) supports this picture , showing that even energetic particles demonstrate collective effects .",

    "gluon saturation models , which can affect the depth of maximum shower development , and the muon content of showers with energies above @xmath108 ev@xcite are disfavored , but not ruled out . in these models , the gluon density in heavy ions becomes saturated , and low@xmath109 gluons may recombine , reducing their abundance .",
    "they predict that the charged particle multiplicity in @xmath98 collisions should be lower than the multiplicity scaled from @xmath2 collisions ; data shows the opposite , with the @xmath98 multiplicity higher than in simple @xmath2 scaling .",
