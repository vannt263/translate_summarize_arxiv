    "the concept of weak value was originally proposed by aharonov and his collaborators  @xcite in terms of the weak measurement .",
    "many experiments have been carried out  @xcite . on the basis of the weak measurement , a formal theory of the weak value",
    "has also been developed  @xcite .",
    "however , we believe that the weak values have to be studied on its own right  @xcite , although its measurability is utmost important .    the weak value of an observable @xmath0 is defined by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the initial and final states . in this work",
    "we specifically consider the case that @xmath4 is a projection operator .",
    "note that in this case the weak value becomes a portion of the partial amplitudes  @xcite @xmath5    it is thus tempting to to interpret the weak value of the projection operator @xmath6 as a conditional probability for a particle initially in the state @xmath2 goes through a particular intermediate state @xmath7 out of the possible intermediate states @xmath8 and is detected in the final state @xmath9 .",
    "there have been debates over the possibility of the probabilistic interpretation of the weak value , which some people do not like because it can be negative or even complex .",
    "it is probably fair to say that the probabilistic interpretation is far from compelling , though consistent with the kolomogorov axioms except the positivity of the probability . in this work",
    "we add a farther argument that supports the probabilistic interpretation of the weak values on the basis of bayesian statistics .    in sec",
    "ii , we give a very brief introduction of the bayes relation and the present status of quantum bayesian statistics .",
    "we derive a quantum version of bayes relation identifying the weak values as the bayes conditional probabilities . using a simple mach - zehnder interferometer model , we present in sec iii an example of the weak measurements to evaluate the weak values .",
    "sec iv is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "the bayesian probability is a degree of likeliness in contrast to the standard frequency based probability theory .",
    "the key equation in the bayesian probability theory  @xcite is the bayes relation for the conditional probabilities : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are probabilities for events @xmath13 and @xmath14 to occur , respectively .",
    "the @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the conditional probability for @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) to occur under the condition @xmath14 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "normally it is assumed that @xmath11 is prior given , while the conditional probability @xmath16 is obtained by measurements and @xmath12 is calculated to be @xmath17 .",
    "then we can obtain by ( [ bayes ] ) the probability @xmath15 .",
    "one of the widely used practical application is to update the probability of @xmath13 by replacing the a priori probability @xmath11 by @xmath15 with the new experience @xmath14 .",
    "alternatively , we may interpret ( [ bayes ] ) as follows .",
    "the @xmath11 is the a priori probability for a hypothesis @xmath13 as before and the @xmath16 is suposingly obtained by observing @xmath14 under the hypothesis @xmath13 .",
    "the left hand side @xmath18 is the probability to retrospectively guess the hypothesis @xmath13 by the data @xmath14 .",
    "note that this implicitly contains a causal interpretation that @xmath13 causes @xmath14 .     and",
    "@xmath19 are the input and output states of a particle , while @xmath20 are the two possible intermediate states .",
    ", width=151 ]    to add a flesh to the second interpretation , consider a simple bayesian network shown in fig.1 .",
    "a particle comes into either @xmath21 or @xmath22 with the probability @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , and then is detected at either @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "the bayes relation ( [ bayes ] ) reads , @xmath27 and similar expressions for @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the conditional probabilities for the particle will be detected when it comes into @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the bayesian update method in the first interpretation has already been directly applied to the state estimation in the context of quantum measurement theories by several authors .",
    "jones  @xcite proposed the quantum bayesian update of a pure state and later schack , brun and caves extended it to a certain class of mixed states  @xcite , in which @xmath13 in ( [ bayes ] ) is the initial density operator and @xmath14 is the measurement outcome by a povm in the generalized measurement .",
    "the formula for the updated density operator looks like the bayesian relation , which they call the quantum bayesian relation .    in the present work",
    ", however , we fix the initial state once and for all , and concentrate on the likeliness of the intermediate state from the probability to obtain the final state .",
    "here lurks a subtle point in quantum mechanics : the conditioning the intermediate state keeping the initial state intact .",
    "we assume that the likeliness of the intermediate state is given by the weak value of the projection operator to the intermediate state for given initial and final states . in a sense",
    "we propose a quantum analog of classical hypothesis guessing rather than the tomography of the initial state . in the quantum case",
    "the causality has to be carefully treated ; the seemingly counter - factual conditioning of the intermediate state is realized by a tiny interaction of the measured system and the meter , a key ingredient of the weak measurement .    from our point of view , this use of the bayesian relation is more fundamental than the tomography in quantum mechanics",
    ". we have to caution the reader that we stick to the standard quantum mechanics not trying to reconstruct quantum mechanics on the basis of bayesian probability theory  @xcite .",
    "let the initial state be @xmath2 and the final ( post - selected ) state be @xmath9 and consider the weak value@xcite of the projection operator @xmath4 defined by @xmath31 by a simple manipulation , we obtain @xmath32^{*}\\cdot\\frac{p(a)}{p(z ) }   \\label{weakvalue1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the projection operator @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are probabilities to get @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively according to the born rule .",
    "we see that the two kinds of the weak values @xmath39 and @xmath40 are related by the bayese - like relation .",
    "note that the factor @xmath41 on the right hand is the complex conjugate of the weak value @xmath40 .",
    "this is suggestive in the probabilistic interpretation because the complex conjugation implies the time reversal in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is thus tempting to identify the real part of the weak value @xmath39 as the conditional probability @xmath42 to arrive at the state @xmath9 via the state @xmath7 and similar to the weak value , @xmath40 .",
    "writing @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] , we end up with the bayes relation : @xmath45 we use @xmath46 in ( [ qbayes ] ) and assume @xmath42 is experimentally accessible .",
    "the choice of the real part rather than e.g. , the absolute value seems unique assuming the linearity of the conditional probability : @xmath47 .",
    "if one prefers an axiomatic description , one can prove this replacing the fifth axiom in the previous paper@xcite by the bayes relation ( [ qbayes ] ) .",
    "we remark that the weak value can also be expressed as @xmath48 which suggests that @xmath49 is the joint probability for @xmath7 and then @xmath9 to occur provided that the final state is @xmath9 . however , caution has to be paid , because the projection operators @xmath33 and @xmath0 are not in general commutable , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "this non - commutativity makes the weak value complex in general .",
    "the imaginary part of the weak value is thus given by @xmath51=\\frac{1}{2i}\\frac{{\\langle{\\psi}|}[\\hat{z},\\hat{a}]{|{\\psi}\\rangle}}{p(z)}.   \\label{imaginary}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore the imaginary part of the weak value is the lower bound of the uncertainty relation @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are quantum fluctuation of @xmath14 and @xmath13 in the state @xmath2 .",
    "note also that @xmath55 is the geometric phase for the loop of the state change : @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "so far is a formal and mathematical discussion .",
    "suppose we interpret the weak values @xmath39 and @xmath40 as conditional probabilities .",
    "what probability does it precisely mean ?",
    "we propose that the former weak value is the probability for the state to pass through @xmath7 provided that the initial state is @xmath2 and the final state is @xmath9 as some of the advocates of the probabilistic interpretation of weak values claim .",
    "the latter is a new face , because the state @xmath7 is the final state rather than the intermediate state .",
    "our interpretation of it is the counter factual probability distribution that we would obtain @xmath38 if the state passed through the state @xmath7 . to demonstrate that this interpretation works , we present a simple mach - zehnder model in the following section",
    "consider the standard mach - zehnder interferometer depicted in fig.1 and assume that the incident photon enters the interferometer from the left - top as a superposition @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are given but not necessarily known complex coefficients .",
    "the beam splitters make the following unitary transitions , @xmath60,\\;\\;{|{a'}\\rangle}\\rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[{|{b}\\rangle}-{|{c}\\rangle}],\\;\\ ; { |{b}\\rangle}\\rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[{|{d}\\rangle}-{|{d'}\\rangle}],\\;\\;{|{c}\\rangle}\\rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[{|{d}\\rangle}+{|{d'}\\rangle } ] .",
    "$ ] and therefore the sequential transition becomes @xmath61     correspond to the states in fig.1 .",
    "a photon is injected as a superposition of @xmath13 and @xmath62 and detected at @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    ", width=151 ]    we interpret the weak value @xmath63 as the a posteriori probability for the photon to have taken the path @xmath21 looking backward in time provided that the photon is found in the port @xmath25 , which can be extracted by the weak measurement in the sense that the probe wave function in the coordinate representation is displaced by the amount proportional to the real part of the weak value .",
    "the imaginary part shows up as the displacement in the momentum representation .",
    "@xcite .",
    "more precisely , insert a slightly tilted thin slide glass in the path @xmath21 in the mach - zehnder interferometer ( fig.3 ) .",
    "this introduces the interaction between the original optical system and the newly introduced degree of freedom @xmath38 perpendicular to the optical axis , which we call the probe@xcite .",
    "3 cm . a photon detected by @xmath25 ( @xmath26 )",
    "is deflected by @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) in the direction perpendicular to the optical axis . , title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    the thin slide glass refracts the photon off the optical axis by @xmath66 only if it passes through @xmath21 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the momentum conjugate to the perpendicular displacement @xmath38 .",
    "according to the standard weak measurement protocol , we post select the @xmath25-port to count the number of photons detected at @xmath38 .",
    "let the initial probe wave function be @xmath69 .",
    "the probability distribution is then predicted for a small @xmath66 as @xmath70 following the standard weak measurement formulation the real part of weak value @xmath71 can be obtained by the shift of the average of the probe position : @xmath72=\\frac{z_{d}}{n_d } , \\label{shift}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we know the parameter @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath73 is the sum of the z - coordinates of the detected @xmath74 photons at the d - port .",
    "the right hand side can also be obtained as the center of the distribution by classical light rather than by the photon counting much more easily .    in",
    "what follows , using the same mach - zehnder interferometer model , we show a protocol to extract the real part of the other weak value @xmath75 on the right hand side of the bayes relation : @xmath76 in terms of experimentally accessible quantities .",
    "note that @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the number of incident photons and @xmath74 is the number of detected photons at @xmath25 port and that @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , we obtain    @xmath80    where @xmath73 and @xmath81 are the sums of the z - coordinates of the detected @xmath74 photons at the @xmath25-port and that of the @xmath26-port , respectively .",
    "we note that all the informations of the coordinates of the detected photons are involved in ( [ ratio1]),while the expression ( [ shift ] ) uses only the partial data obtained at @xmath25-port , while the data at the @xmath26-port are thrown away .",
    "the original weak value @xmath82 $ ] can be re - expressed via bayes rule by @xmath83={{\\rm re}}[\\frac{{\\langle{\\psi}|}\\hat{d}{|{b}\\rangle}}{{\\langle{\\psi}|{b}\\rangle}}]\\cdot\\frac{|{\\langle{b}|{\\psi}\\rangle}|^2}{|{\\langle{d}|{\\psi}\\rangle}|^2}\\\\ = \\frac{\\frac{z^{b}_{d}}{z^{b}_{d}+z^{b}_{d'}}p_{b}}{\\frac{z^{b}_{d}}{z^{b}_{d}+z^{b}_{d'}}p_{b}+\\frac{z^{c}_{d}}{z^{c}_{d}+z^{c}_{d'}}p_{c}}=\\frac{z^{b}_{d}}{z^{b}_{d}+z^{c}_{d}}.   \\label{mz bayes3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the superfix @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) to the coordinate @xmath14 indicates the z - coordinate shift of the photon when the slide glass is inserted in the path @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "note that the two expressions for the weak values do not contain the coupling parameter @xmath66 in the weak measurement but only the experimentally obtainable quantities @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "to get some insight it would be helpful to see a numerical example : @xmath86 , which gives a negative weak value @xmath82=\\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+\\gamma}=-1 $ ] and the prior probabilities @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "these numerical values can be realized for example by the data @xmath89 in some unit of length .",
    "the negative weak value can intuitively understood by the negative deflection @xmath90 relative to the total deflection @xmath91 .",

    "@xmath98 and @xmath93 .",

    "@xmath105 are experimentally accessible in the measurement of the coordinate and momentum shifts from the optical axis of the detected photon when we inject photons one by one into the mach - zehnder system .",
    "further we see that @xmath106 holds which is equivalent to ( [ mz bayes3 ] ) and ( [ compexshift ] ) .    comparing this with the theoretical weak value @xmath107 , the portion of the partial amplitudes , we obtain a simple formula for the tomography of the initial state @xmath108 as @xmath109 by the measuring the coordinates and momenta of the detected photons in the weak measurements ( see ( [ compexshift2 ] ) ) . at this stage",
    "we can confirm the claim of aav  @xcite that the weak measurement gives the full information of the initial state almost without disturbing it , because the ratio @xmath110 can be defined in the weak coupling limit @xmath111 .",
    "similarly from @xmath112,we have @xmath113 .",

    "a quantum version of bayes rule @xmath115 has been derived .",
    "we interpret the weak value @xmath63 in the quantum bayes relation ( [ qbayes ] ) as the likeliness of the path @xmath116 in the past when the photon is detected in a definite state @xmath117 and the other weak value @xmath118 as the probability distribution of the final state @xmath117 for a counter - factual intermediate state @xmath119 .",
    "an example of protocols to measure the two weak values is shown in a mach - zehnder interferometer model .",
    "the results are @xmath120 where the complex shifts @xmath121 and @xmath122 are defined for each path ( @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) and detected port @xmath25 or @xmath26 in a way that @xmath123 etc .. the equations ( [ qbayes ] ) and ( [ summary ] ) are the main results of the present work .",
    "the complex shifts are constrained by a relation:@xmath124 .",
    "although we have analyzed a specific mach - zehnder model , it seems that the present argument can be straightforwardly generalized to other cases .",
    "there have been debates whether the weak measurement is really quantum phenomenon , because the result can also be understood in classical wave mechanics .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the wave - particle duality can be seen in the bayes relation in an experimentally verifiable way by a simple mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "the left hand side of the bayes relation is obtained by the shift of the probe distribution , which is also possible even by analog classical light while the right hand side can be constructed by a set of measured distances in the z - direction of each detected photon , which can not be collectively achieved by classical light .",
    "we have seen another supporting evidence of the consistency of the probabilistic interpretation of the weak value . on the basis of the quantum bayesian relation combined with the model of the weak measurement ,",
