    "with the spectra of exceptional quality delivered by the high resolution spectrograph of the keck telescope it has become possible to detect individual metal features , most commonly the c iv @xmath51548,1550 doublet , related to the high redshift lyman forest clouds for a large fraction of the stronger lines ( cowie _ et al_. 1996 ; tytler _ et al_. 1996 ; womble , sargent & lyons 1996 ; songaila & cowie 1996 ) . in general appearance",
    "such metal systems are blended complexes of cloud components .",
    "the deduced carbon abundance in the complexes typically is @xmath6 of solar . in their full investigation songaila & cowie",
    "deduce also that si / c is about three times solar ( for each complex considered as an entity ) , pointing to chemical abundances in these systems similar to galactic halo stars . additionally , they find rapid evolution in the column density ratio n(si iv)/n(c iv ) , from values of a few @xmath7 at higher redshifts to about ten times lower at @xmath8 abruptly occurring in a redshift interval @xmath9 , which they suggest arises from a sudden reduction in the opacity to he@xmath10 ionizing photons of the evolving intergalactic medium ( see also cowie in this volume ) .    here",
    "i give some new results on such metal systems from a full analysis of a high quality spectrum of q1626 + 643 @xmath11 obtained on the keck telescope at a resolution @xmath12 km s@xmath1 fwhm , augmented with an analysis of similar quality keck spectra of q1107 + 487 @xmath13 and q1422 + 231 @xmath14 .",
    "in q1626 + 643 there are about 20 metal systems in the range @xmath15 as indicated by c iv absorption in the clear spectral region between the lyman@xmath16 and c iv emission lines .",
    "these metal complexes display a range of ionized species , where detectable in the overall spectrum , from the weakest in which only c iv is detected to the strongest which also contain si iv , c ii , si ii , @xmath17 , al iii , o i , fe ii , ni ii and sometimes n v. an example showing some ions in a relatively rich system is in figure 1 .",
    "typically a complex spans a few hundred km s@xmath1 and often is associated with one or more others in a close group with wide expanses of clear spectrum between such groups .",
    "-1.9 cm 0.4 cm    in an extremely careful analysis using the voigt profile fitting package vpfit ( e.g. carswell _",
    "et al_. 1991 ) i have self - consistently separated these complexes into individual component clouds closely approximating single - phase ionization regions with quite accurate values for column density , doppler parameter @xmath18 and redshift . in the redshift range available to si iv outside the lyman forest 68% of the components defined in c",
    "iv are also detected in si iv .",
    "excellent simultaneous fits are achieved ( as is obvious in figure 1 ) with components each having the same redshift over all species , and the same @xmath19-value for all ions of a given atom , but different column densities .",
    "most of the components are narrow : 60% have @xmath19(c iv ) distributed from 10 km s@xmath1 to below @xmath20 while 12% have @xmath21 20 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the distribution here is more peaked to lower @xmath19-values than that found by rauch _",
    "et al_. ( 1996 ) for clouds dominantly at higher redshifts . particularly for the stronger components the resultant ratios of @xmath19-values for ions of different atoms , e.g. , @xmath19(si iv)/@xmath19(c iv ) , are physically realistic , and yield a temperature structure within the complexes containing values distributed up to a few @xmath22k , typical of photoionization heating , as found earlier ( rauch _ et al_. 1996 ) .",
    "a frequent feature of the systems is the presence of a few broad , high ionization components which co - exist in velocity space with the much more numerous narrow components of lower ionization .",
    "a strong example of this , indicated with c iv and si iv , is shown in figure 1 . in one display",
    "the lower ionization components have been suppressed in the fitted profile leaving a very broad component of @xmath19 = 32 km s@xmath1 with two narrower components , all of which are present strongly in c iv but weak or absent in si iv .",
    "the converse case shows only the lower ionization components , which now demonstrate a striking similarity between the c iv and si iv profiles .",
    "such sets of different component structures must therefore be signatures of physically distinct but spatially closely related regions which can be isolated in the fitting procedure .",
    "while the implicit model in such profile constructions has only temperature and gaussian turbulence broadening included in the specific @xmath19-parameter characterising each assumed cloud in a complex , large velocity gradients from bulk motions must also contribute to the true overall absorption profile .",
    "nonetheless , any spectrum can be described with clustered voigt profile fits to the accuracy required with the available signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the broad , high ionization components revealed here thus probably represent regions of low volume density dominated by bulk motions .",
    "comparison with the results of simulations ( e.g. rauch , haehnelt & steinmetz 1997 ) is important to derive proper physical meaning from such observed profiles .",
    "figure 2 shows values of n(si iv)/n(c iv ) vs redshift for all system components found in the spectrum of q1626 + 643 having n(c iv ) @xmath23 and si iv lying redward of the lyman forest .",
    "immediately noticeable is a remarkable coherence in these values among components in each system , typically extending over a factor only @xmath24 , while there are bulk differences between systems .",
    "such an ionization pattern is not predicted in recent hydrodynamical simulations of collapsing gas structures in the universe photoionized by a metagalactic ionizing background ( rauch , haehnelt & steinmetz 1997 ) , although in many other aspects this modelling shows considerable success in reproducing observed characteristics of absorbers .",
    "this data set is extended with equivalent high quality samples analysed from the spectra of q1107 + 487 and q1422 + 231 , giving coverage over the range @xmath25 ; all are plotted in figure 2 , here excluding systems within 5000 km s@xmath1 of the emission redshifts and those not optically thin in the lyman continuum as assessed from the corresponding lyman region spectra .",
    "contrary to the finding by songaila & cowie ( 1996 ) of rapid evolution near @xmath3 there is no significant overall change in the balance of the ratio values anywhere over the whole range in redshift .",
    "the use here of single - phase ionization cloud components to probe the radiation field must be more effective than summing over whole systems as done by songaila & cowie , but to compare with their data the ratios of the separately totalled system values also are plotted in figure 2 : again there is no evidence for strong evolution near @xmath26 , although at @xmath0 the scatter in these values seems larger than at higher redshifts .",
    "this may be indicating the evolution of collapsing structures .",
    "an evolving @xmath19-value distribution , as noted above , and evident change , e.g. , in n(c ii)/n(c iv ) indicating a trend to higher densities at lower redshifts , also point to this .",
    "such structure evolution will be investigated fully in a later paper ( in preparation ) .",
    "more information on the shape of the ionizing spectrum can be obtained from displays of the ratios n(si iv)/n(c iv ) vs n(c ii)/n(c iv ) than from n(si iv)/n(c iv ) alone ( songaila & cowie 1996 ; giroux & shull 1997 ) . in figure 3",
    "is such a plot from the q1626 + 643 data set compared with model predictions of the cloudy code ( ferland 1996 ) for several assumed ionizing backgrounds and for solar relative abundance of si / c . for the broadly distributed material ( filled symbols ) ,",
    "evident is the relative insensitivity to the spectral shape assumed for the metagalactic background in the span of most of the data .",
    "this allows component values for si / c distributed up to about three times solar , the level previously indicated at higher redshifts for system totals ( songaila & cowie 1996 ; rauch , haehnelt & steinmetz 1997 ) although for clouds with log n(c ii)/n(c iv ) @xmath27 ( i.e. , at lower densities ) values seem closer to solar .",
    "the same conclusion comes for clouds close to the qso ( open symbols ) , here using the more appropriate pure power law spectrum . on the other hand , if the ionizing spectrum is dominated by local effects from massive stars , higher values of n(si iv)/n(c iv )",
    "will result ( giroux & shull 1997 ; savaglio _ et al_. 1997 ) and si / c may be closer to the solar value throughout , as illustrated here with use of a 50000k star model spectrum .",
    "an alternative display using the same model ionizing spectra to construct the ratios @xmath28/n(c ii ) vs n(c ii)/n(c iv ) , also shown in figure 3 , gives less overall dependency on spectral shape so is a better indicator of relative abundance , again in the span of most of the data .",
    "a similar distribution for si / c again results . taken together ,",
    "the two representations indicate that local stellar sources do not dominate the radiation environment for these absorbers , although the not complete consistency between them suggests some , not unexpected , departure from strict photoionization equilibrium ( e.g. , rauch , haehnelt & steinmetz ) .",
    "this is developed in a more complete investigation including several other ions in a later paper ( in preparation ) .",
