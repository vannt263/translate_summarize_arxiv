    "since the discovery of the intrinsic josephson effect not only the typical properties of conventional junctions were demonstrated @xcite , but also unique and surprising features like the coupling of josephson oscillations to phonons @xcite have been discovered . there has also been a considerable interest in the influence of nonequilibrium effects on the @xmath0-characteristic and collective modes @xcite , as the quasi two - dimensional superconducting layers are expected to be more sensitive to external perturbations than bulk materials .",
    "recent measurements of shapirosteps on the resistive branch @xcite suggest to study the role of non - equilibrium effects on these , as the in depth theoretical understanding of this problem is important for any high - precision applications of high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) as a voltage standard .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the microscopic theory for the electronic transport between the superconducting layers is developed and the close analogy of the static case to the normal state is pointed out . then the consequences for the @xmath1-@xmath2-curve , the dispersion of collective modes and the position of shapiro steps are being discussed .",
    "further technical details can be found in @xcite and in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "we consider a stack of @xmath3 ( superconducting ) layers @xmath4 forming @xmath5 intrinsic ( josephson ) junctions in the homogeneous case .",
    "the normal conducting electrodes attached at the top and bottom of the stack in a 2-point measurement are denoted as @xmath6 ( cf .",
    "[ stackbild ] ) .    as a motivation for",
    "the following discussion let us first recall the situation in the normal state .",
    "there the electrical current ( density ) @xmath7 between the layers @xmath8 and @xmath9 is given by the difference of the electrochemical potentials @xmath10 ( fermi energy ) in neighbouring layers ( @xmath11 distance of layers , @xmath12 ) .",
    "this can be separated in a diffusion term driven by the difference @xmath13 of the chemical potentials @xmath14 and a field term @xmath15 .    in turn , the ( static ) charge fluctuation @xmath16 on the layer @xmath8 is determined completely by the filling of the conduction band or the chemical potential @xmath14 respectively . using this and the poisson equation ( @xmath17 : background dielectric constant ) @xmath18 @xmath14",
    "can be eliminated from equ .",
    "[ currentnormal2 ] : @xmath19 with the discrete derivative @xmath20 and the coupling constant @xmath21 for a fixed dc - bias current @xmath22 equ .",
    "[ normalcurrent ] can be used to determine the electric field @xmath23 by applying the operator @xmath24 on equ .",
    "[ normalcurrent ] .",
    "if all conductivities @xmath25 are equal , no charge fluctuations accumulate and @xmath26 , while in the case of only one barrier with a higher resistance ( e.g. @xmath27 ) the electric field is not only localized at the highly resistive junctions , but is spread to neighboring junctions @xmath28    in the superconducting state both the electric field @xmath23 and the difference ( @xmath29 ) @xmath30 of the phases @xmath31 of the superconducting order parameters @xmath32 in neighboring layers are gauge invariant quantities and have an independent physical meaning . its time derivative directly leads to the general josephson relation @xmath33 between the phase @xmath34 and the voltage @xmath35 across the junction , where the scalar potential @xmath36 is given by : @xmath37 as can be seen from the gorkov equation for the single particle greens function , the static part @xmath38 plays the role of the chemical potential @xmath14 in the superconducting state .",
    "in addition to this , a tunneling hamiltonian @xmath39 between the ( bcs - like ) superconducting layers has to be specified explicitly in order to calculate @xmath40 . in the following",
    "we will assume a hopping matrix element @xmath41 , which has both a constant @xmath42 and @xmath11-wave ( i.e. @xmath43 ) part in order to get both a josephson current and a finite quasiparticle conductivity at the same time .",
    "the general structure of the theory will be independent of this choice .",
    "a time dependent perturbation theory up to the second order in the hopping matrixelement @xmath44 is performed , but no assumption for the external electromagnetic potentials @xmath45 and @xmath46 is made .",
    "the resulting expressions for the tunnel current @xmath47 between the layers @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the charge fluctuation @xmath48 on layer @xmath8 are nonlinear in @xmath34 .",
    "thereby @xmath49 is the charge suszeptibility of the superconducting layer , which is for @xmath50 connected with the two dimensional density of states @xmath51 and independent of temperature @xmath52 : @xmath53 .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath54 and the charge contribution @xmath55 in @xmath56 also depend on the scalar potential @xmath36 and have been expressed by feynman diagrams in @xcite .    using the general ansatz for the phase @xmath57 in resistive ( @xmath58 ) and superconducting ( @xmath59 ) junctions , @xmath40 and @xmath60",
    "can be linearized in the ( small ) oscillations @xmath61 and the scalar potential @xmath36 : @xmath62 here we restricted the discussion to a linear quasiparticle characteristic for simplicity .",
    "the conductivities @xmath63 will in general depend on both @xmath64 and the oscillation frequency @xmath65 of @xmath66 , which coincides with @xmath67 e.g. on the autonomous first resistive branch .",
    "products like @xmath68 are to be interpreted as a folding in time space .",
    "all conductivities @xmath69 are of the same order of magnitude as the experimental quasiparticle conductivity @xmath70 ( bi-2212 ) and consequently corrections @xmath71 are small for frequencies @xmath72 on the resistive branch . the conductivity @xmath73 is presented for different values of @xmath67 in fig .",

    "the transition to the conductivity @xmath74 for @xmath75 ( @xmath76 : maximal @xmath11-wave gap ) and the slight difference between the value of @xmath73 in a superconducting and a resistive junction can be seen .",
    "the negative part for small frequencies is not a violation of causality , but arises from the fact that @xmath73 is not a conventional transport coefficient .",
    "the static limit of @xmath73 is subtle and deserves special attention .",
    "formally the result for @xmath50 can not be obtained in our formalism by expanding @xmath60 or @xmath40 in the static part @xmath77 of the scalar potential directly . instead of this",
    "the static inhomogenity has to be included in the equilibrium greens function in zeroth order in @xmath44 . for @xmath78 and @xmath79",
    "one gets the finite value @xmath80 while the strictly static function @xmath81 vanishes exactly for all temperatures .",
    "this discontinuity is due to the fact that our only relaxation mechanism is the incoherence of the hopping @xmath44 between layers .",
    "therefore in a tunneling process ( which is already of order @xmath82 ) no additional relaxation within the layers is possible , if we work strictly in @xmath83 . including strong impurity scattering in the layers , which is the main mechanism for charge imbalance relaxation in @xmath11-wave superconductors , leads to @xmath84 like in @xcite , which will be considered mainly in the following .",
    "it is pointed out that this choice is strictly speaking model dependent and a finite value @xmath85 similar to our result for @xmath86 in equ .",
    "[ sigma1_limit ] could be obtained , if additional scattering mechanisms are considered .",
    "the elimination of @xmath87 , @xmath36 and @xmath88 from equations [ poisson ] , [ josephson ] , [ strom_allgemein ] and [ ladung_allgemein ] leads to a set of coupled equations of motion for the phases @xmath34 ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) : @xmath92 the coupling constants are given as : @xmath93 these are in the static case completely determined by the normal state value in equ .",

    "a more reliable estimate @xmath100 is possible from optical experiments and will be elaborated in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "linearizing the set of equations [ equationsofmotion2 ] one obtains the dispersion of collective modes ( in order @xmath56 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) : @xmath103 for frequencies @xmath104 on the resistive branch these represent weakly damped plasma modes of the superconducting condensate . for the special case",
    "@xmath105 the dispersion @xmath106 for @xmath107 of the goldstone mode associated with the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry in the superconducting state can be obtained explicitly .",

    "[ jos_static1 ] the static part of @xmath116 does not contribute due to @xmath117 , but a finite dc - contribution might arise from the combination of @xmath118 and josephson - like terms in @xmath73 .",

    "[ josephson ] the dc - equations @xmath121 for the sn - junctions are slightly different , as the change of the chemical potential @xmath122 in bulk materials is negligible due to the large density of states .",
    "thereby @xmath123 , which is in the model with strong impurity scattering in the layers given as : @xmath124 .",
    "if we neglect the supercurrent for a moment , the inversion of the operator @xmath125 shows that the _ total _ voltage @xmath126 is _ exactly _ given like in a stack of _ independent _ junctions , i.e. the coupling constant @xmath127 does not enter in the @xmath1-@xmath2-curve .",
    "the dc - component of the supercurrent might add a correction to this due to the interaction @xmath128 at the frequency @xmath67 , but this contribution is suppressed by a factor @xmath129 and therefore no significant effect on dc - properties are expected .    it is pointed out that this general result can not be obtained by assuming an ohmic quasiparticle current @xmath130 as in @xcite .",
    "an additional indication that the correct choice of the quasiparticle current is essential will come from the discussion of shapiro steps in the next section .",
    "this might also be the reason that up to now no clear experimental evidence for the coupling @xmath128 in the @xmath1-@xmath2-characteristic , like small deviations in the additivity of resistive branches @xcite , could be found .",

    "is not contained in this junction , but leaks into neighboring junctions in the same way as around a junction with much lower resistance in a stack of normal junctions .",
    "it is stressed that the above discussion makes use of the fact that @xmath132 in the presence of strong impurity scattering in the layers . in a more general model",
    "this might not be the case and coupling terms @xmath133 appear .",

    "[ eta ] can be of order @xmath135 in any model .",
    "a shapiro step is generated by microwave irradiation of frequency @xmath67 , which creates an oscillating component of the @xmath136-axis bias current @xmath137 .",
    "thereby the dynamics of the phase in a resistive junction is given as @xmath138 therefore the supercurrent ( @xmath139 : bessel functions of first kind ) @xmath140 has a dc component @xmath141 which creates the ( first ) shapiro step in the @xmath1-@xmath2-curve .",
    "the nontrivial question in the following will be , what dc - voltage @xmath142 is connected with a given @xmath67 , if the generalized josephson relation equ .",

    "this can be presented as : @xmath143 for @xmath29 .",
    "this set of @xmath5 equations is not sufficient to determine all @xmath144 voltages @xmath145 and has to be complemented by the current equations [ currentsn_1 ] and [ currentsn_2 ] in the sn - junctions .",
    "note that for the total voltage @xmath142 across the stack the transport coefficients in the intrinsic josephson junctions are irrelevant .    in the `` superconducting '' state , which is defined by @xmath146 for all @xmath29 , one easily obtains ( in @xmath147 ) @xmath148 and the total dc - voltage @xmath149 this linear branch reflects the contact resistances at both sn - junctions and is not affected by the coupling @xmath150 , although the voltages @xmath145 in the intrinsic junctions in general do not vanish .    for a single resistive junction in the top layer @xmath151 ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 else ) one obtains analogously : @xmath155",

    "@xmath158 and the shapiro step is where expected , which would not be obtained by using the ohmic quasiparticle current alone ( @xmath159 ) like in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless this result opens up the principal possibility that there _ is _ a shift in the position of the shapirostep in a more general theory ( e.g including electron - phonon scattering ) due to nonequilibrium effects , where @xmath160 might not vanish . taking out result equ .",
    "[ sigma1_limit ] seriously the relative shift would be small @xmath161 , but detectable .",
    "this result is also valid in a 4-point measurement geometry , as sketched in fig .",

    "although the total voltage @xmath162 across the intrinsic contacts depends on @xmath127 , this deviation of the expected position of the shapiro step _ can not _ be detected at the contacts .",

    "[ 4point_v ] .",
    "also in the non equilibrium theory of @xcite there is no shift of shapiro steps .",
    "finally , note that all the above considerations only apply to an experimental situation where the _ electric field _",
    "@xmath165 is measured directly to determine the dc - voltage @xmath166 .",
    "this might not be operational with conventional voltmeters , which actually detect a current through a circuit with high resistance , which is driven by the difference of the electrochemical potentials @xmath167 rather than the voltage @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "the microscopic theory of tunneling in layered superconductors has been studied including the effect of the scalar potential on the layers and an estimate of the coupling constant @xmath100 has been given from optical experiments .",
    "the static quasiparticle current includes both field and diffusion terms as in the normal state , which turns out to be crucial for all dc properties . in the model with strong impurity scattering in the layers , shapiro steps are exactly at the expected position @xmath168 . in this case",
