    "larmor precession is a well - known effect in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics . within the nonrelativistic theory the larmor precession frequency",
    "does not depend on the particle velocity but only on the size of the magnetic dipole moment and the strength of the applied field .",
    "furthermore , the effect is linear in both the size of the magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) and the strength of the field .",
    "there is no upper bound on the larmor precession frequency : in principle , it increases infinitely as the applied field increases .",
    "recently  @xcite , we have examined the properties of spin splitting of neutral relativistic particles in 1d and showed a deviation of the behavior of the larmor precession frequency from the nonrelativistic result .",
    "we have shown two notable effects .",
    "first , an upper limit @xmath0 of the spin splitting in 1d exists , which is independent of the size of mdm or the strength of the applied field .",
    "second , the spin splitting depends on the particle momentum and velocity , which we have referred to as relativistic motional decrease effect .    here",
    "we explore the properties of spin splitting in 3d for both neutral and charged relativistic particles .",
    "we show that the relativistic motional decrease effect is present , in a modified form , for both neutral and charged particles in 3d .",
    "however , in 3d there is no upper limit for spin splitting for neither neutral nor charged particles .",
    "the reason for this is different in the two cases .",
    "the hamiltonian of a neutral relativistic particle propagating in a static magnetic and/or electric field reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the longitudinal component ( along the direction of the applied field ) of the spin vector operator in relativistic theory , @xmath3 is the electric field , @xmath4 is the magnetic field , @xmath5 is the size of the electric dipole moment ( edm ) and @xmath6 is the size of the magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) of the relativistic particle .",
    "the term @xmath7 lifts the spin degeneracy and the four distinct eigenvalues are    [ eq : eigene ] @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the transverse component of the particle momentum .",
    "if @xmath11 the eigenvalues   reduce to the 1d case considered previously  @xcite .",
    "the spin splitting @xmath12 reads @xmath13 it depends not only on the longitudinal momentum @xmath14 , along the direction of the applied electric field , but also on the transverse momentum @xmath10 .",
    "however these momentum components enter in the eigenvalues in different manner and lead to qualitatively different behaviors . because both the longitudinal momentum @xmath14 and the transverse momentum @xmath10 enter quadratically in the spin splitting , the latter does not depend on their signs ; hence",
    ", we shall assume for simplicity that both @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , because when @xmath17 is replaced by @xmath18 the spin splitting in eq .",
    "changes its sign too , we shall assume without loss of generality that @xmath19 ; then we find from eq .   that @xmath20 .    because @xmath21 we conclude that @xmath22 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath14 , with the maximum value of @xmath22 achieved for @xmath23 .",
    "this behavior is the same as in the 1d case  @xcite .",
    "the expression for @xmath24 reads @xmath25    there are two distinct regimes depending on the size of the interaction energy @xmath17 :    @xmath26    similarly to the 1d model  @xcite @xmath27 grows linearly with @xmath17 until a threshold value is reached , after which @xmath27 stays constant .",
    "however , unlike the 1d model  @xcite , the threshold value @xmath28 and the saturation values depend not only on the rest mass energy @xmath29 , but also on the value of the transverse momentum @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , in the 3d model a global upper limit for the spin splitting does not exist since @xmath10 may be arbitrarily large .",
    "however , for any fixed @xmath10 , the value @xmath28 is the maximum value that the spin splitting @xmath27 can have .",
    "we refer to it as the _ dynamical upper limit _ for a given transverse momentum @xmath10 .",
    "it is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .     for different values of the transverse momentum @xmath10 .",
    "the dynamical upper limit @xmath30 increases with the transverse momentum @xmath10 .",
    "the longitudinal momentum is @xmath31 . ]",
    "_ * low - speed limit .",
    "* _ for small values of @xmath14 , the spin splitting can be expanded in taylor series versus @xmath14 , @xmath32 when @xmath11 eq .",
    "reduces to the 1d expression @xcite .",
    "as @xmath10 increases the size of the energy shift decreases  a dependence , which is the opposite to the one on the longitudinal momentum @xmath14 .    _",
    "* high - speed limit .",
    "* _ for large values of @xmath14 , we find from eq .",
    "the high - speed approximation @xmath33 for @xmath11 , eq .",
    "reduces to the high - speed limit in the 1d case  @xcite .",
    "obviously , the spin splitting in this limit increases with the transverse momentum @xmath34 .     for different values of the longitudinal momentum @xmath14 for @xmath35 .",
    "]    because @xmath36 / ( e^{\\uparrow}e^{\\downarrow } ) > 0 $ ] , the spin splitting @xmath37 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath10 .",
    "this is also evident in eqs .   and , and figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we refer to this behavior as _ transverse motional increase _ for the spin - splitting @xmath37 , and _ transverse motional blue shift _ for the associated larmor precession frequency @xmath38 .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] for a fixed interaction energy @xmath39 .",
    "the line for @xmath23 shows no transverse motional increase , as expected : then the spin splitting is given by eq .  .",
    "if @xmath40 the spin splitting would not be constant with @xmath10 , but would manifest transverse motional blue - shift effect described by eq .  .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows that the transverse blue shift is more pronounced for larger values of the longitudinal momentum @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , the transverse blue - shift effect is larger for larger values of the interaction energy @xmath17 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .     for different values of the interaction energy @xmath17 for @xmath41 .",
    "the hamiltonian for a charged particle in an external magnetic field in the landau gauge reads @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the vector magnetic potential .",
    "the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are the relativistic landau levels @xcite , @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes `` up '' and `` down '' spin states along the propagation direction .",
    "the spin splitting for the @xmath46-th landau level is given by @xmath47 the spin splitting for a charged particle in 3d is qualitatively different from the expression   for a neutral particle .",
    "the difference is due to the coupling of the magnetic field to the charge of the particle , which modifies the orbital dynamics by formation of landau levels .",
    "the relativistic expression is also different from the nonrelativistic result , @xmath48 which is readily obtained from the nonrelativistic expression for the landau levels , @xmath49 we note that in the nonrelativistic expression the spin splitting is the same for all landau levels  it does not depend on the index @xmath46 .    because it follows from eq .",
    "that , as for neutral particles , @xmath50 , we conclude that the spin splitting of a charged particle also exhibits the relativistic motional red - shift effect along the direction of the applied field",
    ". however , this effect shows some quantitative deviations from the motional decrease effect of neutral particles because of the difference in the definitions of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "_ * low - speed and low - field limit . * _ the low - speed and low - field approximation of eq",
    ".   reads ( up to second order in @xmath14 and @xmath4 ) @xmath53 the first term is the nonrelativistic result ; within it the spin splitting does not depend on the particle longitudinal momentum @xmath14 and the landau level index @xmath46 , and the splitting is linear in the magnetic field @xmath4 .",
    "the next terms depend on both @xmath14 and @xmath46 , and introduce a quadratic dependence on the magnetic field . in this low - speed limit",
    "the relativistic motional decrease effect is embodied in the @xmath54-term .",
    "obviously , for heavier particles the spin splitting decrease is smaller .",
    "we point out that the @xmath55-term in eq .   also reduces the spin splitting .",
    "this term introduces an @xmath46-dependence in the relativistic spin splitting : the larger the landau level index @xmath46 the greater the red shift .",
    "we refer to this effect as _ landau ladder red shift_. this effects signals yet another difference from the nonrelativistic result , in which the spin splitting is the same for all landau levels .",
    "we note that the landau level index @xmath46 in some sense substitutes the quantum numbers @xmath56 and @xmath57 of transverse motion ( if the @xmath4-field is along @xmath58 ) .",
    "we have shown above that for neutral particles the transverse motion leads to a _ blue shift _ of the spin splitting , which is qualitatively the opposite of the effect of @xmath46 on the spin splitting for charged particles here .",
    "this difference is due to the formation of landau levels",
    ". the landau ladder red - shift effect is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] where it is evident that the spin splitting is smaller for higher landau levels .     and",

    "_ * high - speed limit .",
    "* _ in the limit of very high speeds ( @xmath60 ) the spin splitting has the asymptotic behavior @xmath61 this expression describes how the spin splitting tends to zero when @xmath60 .",
    "notably , it does not depend on the mass of the particle and the landau levels .",
    "it is proportional only to the magnetic field strength and inversely proportional to the longitudinal momentum .",
    "the behavior vs. @xmath14 is very similar to the high - speed limit of the spin splitting of neutral particles .    with respect to the strength of the magnetic field @xmath4 the spin splitting grows monotonically but non - linearly , as it is also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "in contrast to neutral particles , there is no upper bound for the spin splitting versus the magnetic field strength .",
    "however , for a given value of @xmath4 , the nonrelativistic value is always larger than the relativistic one , which is subjected to the motional red shift and the landau ladder red shift .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the spin splitting of neutral and charged relativistic particles in 3d .",
    "we have shown that for a neutral particle , the upper bound for the 1d case is modified to a _",
    "dynamical _ upper bound in the 3d case .",
    "the dynamical upper bound depends on both the mass of the particle and the transverse momentum .",
    "we have shown that the transverse motion of the neutral particle leads to a motional increase of the spin splitting and correspondingly , to a transverse motional blue shift for the associated larmor frequency .",
    "we have shown that the longitudinal motional decrease of the spin splitting is also present for charged particles .",
    "however , there are differences between neutral and charged particles due to the formation of landau levels in the latter .",
