    "these are the motivations for this paper analyzing the performance of the relay networks with wireless energy transfer .",
    "the concept of using a rf signal for simultaneously wireless information and energy transfer is introduced in @xcite for flat and frequency selective fading channels , respectively .",

    "the design problem is cast in the form of minimizing the outage probability subject to a total energy consumption constraint at the source .",
    "we use the a switching protocol for the relay - based data / energy transfer .",
    "our contributions are as follows :    1 .",
    "we derive closed - form expressions for the optimal time sharing between the energy and information signals such that the energy - limited outage probability is minimized ( theorem [ thr : tet ] ) . also , we obtain closed - form expressions for the optimal , in terms of energy - constrained outage probability , power allocation of the source ( theorem [ thr : pow ] )",
    ". moreover , we study the optimal position of the relay that minimizes the outage probability .",

    "2 .   for the multi - relay network with @xmath0 relays",
    ", we consider the opportunistic relaying with perfect csi and derive the outage probability and high signal - to - noise - ratios ( snr ) performance of the system .",
    "subsequently , it is shown that the diversity order of the scheme is @xmath1 ( theorem [ thr : opor_full ] and corollary [ corr : opor_full ] ) .",
    "we also evaluate the outage performance of the opportunistic relaying in the cases where either the source - relay or the relay - destination csi is available , and show that in this case the diversity order is equal to 1 .",
    "we prove that the relay selection criteria based on the source - relay csi has better , in terms of outage probability , performance than the one based on the relay - destination csi ( theorem [ thr : opor_partial ] and corollary [ corr : opor_partial ] ) .",
    "compared to the literature , e.g. , @xcite , we consider different power amplifier ( pa ) model , optimization criteria / metrics , and problem formulation , which lead to completely different analysis / conclusions .",
    "moreover , our discussions on the optimal time sharing between energy and information signals , the optimal relay position , the optimal power allocation at the source , diversity order of opportunistic relaying in energy harvesting networks , and comparison of different relay selections criteria based on the available csi have not been presented before .",
    "our analytical results which have been confirmed by simulations indicate that the optimal time sharing , with respect to the source transmission power , has two regions in which the optimal time sharing is independent and increasing functions of the source transmit power ( theorem [ thr : tet ] and fig .",

    "we consider a relay - assisted cooperative communication setup consisting of a source , a relay , and a destination . in harmony with ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite , we ignore the direct link between the source and the destination .",
    "the source and the destination nodes have constant , e.g. , wired , power supply . on the other hand",

    "the channel coefficients remain constant during the channel coherence time and then change according to their probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) . the source - relay and the relay - destination distances",
    "are denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the expected channel gain is modeled as @xmath7 for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the path loss exponent of the corresponding link and @xmath10 is a parameter independent of @xmath11 and determined according to , e.g. , the transmitter and the receiver antenna gains and shadowing .",
    "also , we define the channel gains as @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the results are obtained for rayleigh fading channels where the channel gains pdf are given by @xmath14 for @xmath8 .",
    "let us denote the total packet transmission length from the source to the destination by @xmath15 .",
    "the energy transfer and data communication protocol is in three phases as follows . in the first phase , of length @xmath16,$ ] the relay harvests energy from the source transmitted energy signal .",
    "let @xmath17 be the transmission power of the source during the energy transmission phase .",
    "then , the baseband signal model in this period is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) of the energy receiver of the relay with variance @xmath20 .",
    "for simplicity , we set @xmath21 .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that in many practical energy harvesting systems the harvested energy due to the noise ( including both the antenna noise and the rectifier noise ) is negligible , e.g. , @xcite . also , it is straightforward to extend the results to the cases with different noise variances . in this way , the energy harvested by the relay at the end of the energy transfer phase is given by @xmath22 , with @xmath23 representing the efficiency factor of the energy harvesting circuit . with no loss of generality",
    ", we set @xmath24 . also , we assume an ideal battery for the relay , such that no overflow occurs . also , it is straightforward to extend the results to the cases with a peak energy storage for the battery .",
    "let us define @xmath25 as the minimum energy required by the relay to process the source signal and send feedbacks .",
    "once the relay s required energy , @xmath25 , is supplied in phase 1 , it sends one bit acknowledgement to the source , and the information transfer starts where the information is forwarded to the destination through the relay ( the consumed energy for sending one bit feedback is included in the relay s minimum required energy ) .",

    "hence the channel is modeled as @xmath29 with @xmath30 denoting the source power for the information signal , and @xmath31 is the awgn of the information receiver of the relay with variance @xmath32 .",
    "+ finally , if the relay correctly decodes the source message , it uses the last time slot of length @xmath26 to forward the codeword to the destination .",
    "thus , the destination s received signal is given by @xmath33 where the relay signal @xmath34 follows @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the additive white gaussian noise with with variance @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the relay s information transmission power . finally , with no loss of generality , we set @xmath39 and assume the packets to be sufficiently long such that the results are independent of @xmath15 , so it can be removed from the analysis .",
    "we assume an ideal energy consumption model for the source , motivated by the fact that the base stations are commonly equipped with considerably stronger pas than the relays . in the meantime , it is straightforward to extend the results to the cases with non - ideal pas at the source . on the other hand , we adopt an affine model for the power consumption of the relay , where the relay s power consumption is modeled by @xmath40 here , @xmath41 represents the inefficiency of the pa and @xmath42 represents the relay s bias power during data transmission .",
    "this is a well - established model for the pas @xcite and has been considered for different applications @xcite .",
    "we analyze the system performance for two power allocation models at the relay :    1 .",

    "a constant power @xmath45 is used by the relay to forward the information to the destination .",
    "thus , from ( [ eq : power_cons_model ] ) , the total energy consumed by the relay during the second and the third phases is @xmath46 in this way , if the the relay s minimum energy is not supplied in phase 1 , the relay does not become active , and a circuit outage event occurs .",
