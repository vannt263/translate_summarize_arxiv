    "when thinking about quadratic and homogeneous hamiltonian systems on the dual of a lie algebra , the first example that comes to our mind is the system describing the rotations of a free rigid body around its center of mass .",
    "this system was derived by euler in 1758 ( see e.g. @xcite ) then generalized by poincar ( see @xcite ) , and then again later by arnold ( see e.g. @xcite ) starting from the original @xmath0 lie algebra , to a general lie algebra .",
    "the mathematical literature contains a huge amount of writings concerning euler s equations , from their original form to the most general forms ( see e.g. @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ".    recently , in @xcite it is proved that under suitable non - degeneracy conditions , a quadratic and homogeneous ( quadratic ) hamiltonian system defined on the dual of the lie algebra @xmath1 of real @xmath2 - skew - symmetric matrices , where @xmath2 is an arbitrary @xmath3 real symmetric matrix , is affinely equivalent to euler s equations ( euler s equations with three linear controls ) describing the free rigid body dynamics .",
    "more exactly , in both cases above , the non - degeneracy condition requires the existence of a positive definite linear combination between the quadratic form generated by @xmath2 and respectively the quadratic form that generates the hamiltonian of the system . in @xcite",
    "it is introduced a general family of quadratic hamiltonian systems that generalizes the quadratic hamiltonian systems defined on the dual of the lie algebra @xmath1 , and consequently gives also a generalization of euler s equations describing the free rigid body dynamics ( with linear controls ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to construct explicitly the normal form of an interesting subset of quadratic hamiltonian system from this general family , that generalize euler s equations ( with linear controls )",
    ".    for details on poisson geometry and hamiltonian dynamics , see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this section we give an explicit method to compute the normal form of a general quadratic hamiltonian system on a natural extension of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a given @xmath3 real symmetric matrix .",
    "recall that the lie algebra @xmath1 is defined as @xmath6 .",
    "note that in the case when @xmath2 is nonsingular , @xmath1 is the lie algebra of the lie group @xmath7 of @xmath2-orthogonal @xmath3 matrices .",
    "an immediate consequence of the this proposition is that @xmath18 @xmath8 , viewed as a dual of a lie algebra , it has a natural poisson structure , namely the `` minus '' lie - poisson structure , which in this case proves to be generated by the poisson bracket : @xmath19 for any @xmath20 , where the smooth function @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 for more details regarding this bracket and the associated lie - poisson dynamics , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "let us now generalize the above setting by introducing the poisson manifold @xmath25 , where the poisson bracket @xmath26 is defined by : @xmath27 for any @xmath20 , and the smooth function @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 using the above definition of the poisson bracket , it follows that the smooth function @xmath30 is a casimir invariant function .",
    "the main result in @xcite states that if there exists @xmath36 such that @xmath37 is positive ( or negative ) definite , then the system is affinely equivalent to euler s equations of the free rigid body dynamics with linear controls , namely : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a real diagonal @xmath3 matrix , and @xmath40 . in the case",
    "when @xmath41 , the equations are exactly the euler s equations of the free rigid body dynamics .",
    "note that in coordinates , the system become : @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the coordinates of @xmath44 .",
    "[ mr ] if the matrices @xmath45 and @xmath2 commutes , then the system is orthogonally equivalent to the dynamical system : @xmath46 where the real diagonal @xmath3 matrices @xmath47 , @xmath48 are given by @xmath49 , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a @xmath3 orthogonal matrix , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 .    as a consequence of the commutativity of the real symmetric matrices @xmath45 and @xmath2 ( i.e. , @xmath54=ak - ka=0 $ ] )",
    ", there exists an orthogonal matrix @xmath51 which diagonalize simultaneously both the matrices @xmath45 and @xmath2 .",
    "more exactly , there exists two @xmath3 real diagonal matrices @xmath47 and respectively @xmath48 such that @xmath49 , and respectively @xmath50 .",
    "next , we will show that : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a solution of the dynamical system : @xmath59 and respectively @xmath60 , is a solution of the dynamical system @xmath61 to prove this assertion , note first that : @xmath62\\times [ \\operatorname{det } ( r)arv+(\\operatorname{det}(r))^{2}\\bold{a}]\\\\ & = ( \\operatorname{det } ( r))^{2}[(krv+\\operatorname{det}(r)\\bold{k})\\times ( arv+\\operatorname{det}(r)\\bold{a})]\\\\ & = ( krv+\\operatorname{det}(r)\\bold{k})\\times ( arv+\\operatorname{det}(r)\\bold{a})\\\\ & = ( rd_k v+\\operatorname{det}(r)\\bold{k})\\times ( rd_a v+\\operatorname{det}(r)\\bold{a})\\\\ & = ( rd_k v+\\operatorname{det}(r)rr^{t}\\bold{k})\\times ( rd_a v+\\operatorname{det}(r)rr^{t}\\bold{a})\\\\ & = [ r(d_k v+\\operatorname{det}(r)r^{t}\\bold{k})]\\times [ r(d_a v+\\operatorname{det}(r)r^{t}\\bold{a})]\\\\ & = \\operatorname{det } ( r ) r^{-t}[(d_k v+\\hat{\\bold{k}})\\times ( d_a v+\\hat{\\bold{a}})]\\\\ & = \\operatorname{det } ( r ) r[(d_k v+\\hat{\\bold{k}})\\times ( d_a v+\\hat{\\bold{a}})].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , @xmath63\\\\ & \\leftrightarrow\\dot v=(d_k v+\\hat{\\bold{k}})\\times ( d_a v+\\hat{\\bold{a}}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]"
