    "the metallicity of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) in clusters of galaxies is a sensitive tracer of both the history of the hierarchical clustering and the chemical evolutions of member galaxies and clusters themselves .",
    "since the icm has been enriched by the supernova explosions , the study of the metal abundance gradient in clusters , especially in those distant ones , may provide us with crucial constraints on the sn rate , stellar mass loss rate , and thus star formation rate .",
    "along with the metal enrichment , a tremendous amount of the supernova energy has been inputted into the icm , primarily in the form of gas dynamic energy that may be used to heat the icm .",
    "thus detailed measurements of the metal distribution in clusters as a function of redshift may also provide us with valuable hints to investigate how the icm has been heated , a puzzling question that has plagued astronomers for a long time since the absence of massive cooling gas has been confirmed in many clusters ( see , e.g. , makishima et al .",

    "2004 ) and in much more details by the high spatial resolution observations of _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ , which allows us to measure the abundances of iron and other metals with sufficient accuracy to deduce the sn ia and sn ii enrichments and their spatial variations . in clusters that exhibit a central iron excess ,",
    "it has been found that the average iron abundance is typically @xmath14 solar within a radius of 3080 kpc , which descends to about @xmath15 solar in the outer regions . in several most neighboring sources , such as m87/the virgo cluster ( matsushita et al .",

    "the distribution of the oxygen abundance , on the other hand , is roughly uniform within the errors .",
    "these results strongly support the idea that there has been an excess sn ia enrichment in the cluster s inner region .    for the time being , the spatial distributions of metal abundances in clusters at @xmath17 are less understood due to the instrumental limitations , although there is evidence that the same central iron abundance excess may also exist ( e.g. , allen et al . 2001 , 2002 ; iwasawa et al . 2001 ) . as a step to approach more distant clusters , in this paper we present the _ chandra _ study of the iron abundance distribution in ms 0839.9 + 2938 , an intermediately distant cluster located at @xmath0 ( stocke et al .",
    "the cluster was listed as an extended x - ray source and identified as a cluster in the _ einstein _ extended medium sensitivity survey ( gioia et al .",
    "it hosts a giant cd galaxy at its dynamic center , which is a weak , compact radio source with an intense , extended @xmath18 emission ( nesci et al .",
    "the advent of studying this source is that since its average gas temperature is low ( @xmath19 kev ; see  4.2 ) , it is easier to measure the abundance gradient accurately due to the large equivalent widths of fe-@xmath20 and -@xmath21 lines .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in  2",
    ", we describe the observation and data reduction .",
    "in  3 and  4 , we present the imaging and spectral analyses , respectively . in  5 , we investigate the spatial distributions of the gas and gravitating mass as well as gas cooling . finally , we discuss and summarize our results in  6 and  7 , respectively . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt the cosmological parameters @xmath22 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , so that @xmath25 corresponds to @xmath26 kpc at the redshift of the cluster . in order to compare directly with previous results",
    ", we use the older solar abundances from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) , where the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is @xmath27 in number , which is about 46% higher than the currently preferred meteoritic value ( mcwilliam 1997 ; grevesse & sauval 1999 ) . unless stated otherwise , the quoted errors are the 90% confidence limits .",
    "the _ chandra _ observation of ms 0839.9 + 2938 was carried out on january 29 , 2001 for a total exposure of 29.7 ks with the chips 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "the center of the cluster was positioned close to the nominal aim point on the s3 chip ( ccd 7 ) , so that most of the x - ray emission of the galaxy was covered by the s3 chip .",
    "the events were collected with frame times of 3.2 s and telemetered in the faint mode .",
    "the focal plane temperature was set to be -120 @xmath28c . in this work",
    ", we used the _ chandra _ data analysis package ciao software ( version 3.0 ) to process the data extracted from the s3 chip only .",
    "we kept events with _",
    "grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 , and removed all the bad pixels , bad columns , and columns adjacent to bad columns and node boundaries . in order to detect occasional background flares , whose effects are particularly significant on the backside - illuminated s1 and s3 chips , we examined the lightcurves of the background regions on the s3 chip both in 2.57 kev , where the background flares are expected most significant , and in 47 kev , where the source contamination is least .",
    "we found that there was almost no strong background flares that increased the count rate to over 20% more than its mean value . by excluding the high background intervals we obtained a net exposure of 27.1 ks for the analyses .",
    "we restrict our spectral study in 0.78.0 kev to avoid the calibration uncertainties at the low energy end and the instrumental background at the high energy end . in the spectral fittings , we have taken into account corrections for the acis quantum efficiency degradation and used the xspec v11.2.0 software .",
    "in figure 1 , we present both the smoothed 0.78.0 kev image of the central @xmath29 ( @xmath30 kpc ) of ms 0839.9 + 2938 in the logarithmic scale , and the corresponding dss optical image on which the x - ray contours are overlaid . the smoothed x - ray image was created by using the ciao tool csmooth with a minimum significance of 3 and a maximum significance of 5 , and has been background - subtracted and exposure - corrected .",
    "as can be seen clearly , the diffuse x - ray emission is strongly peaked at the cluster s center . within the innermost @xmath31 ( @xmath32 kpc )",
    ", it appears to be elongated approximately in the northwest - southeast direction , where it follows the distribution of the optical lights . outside this region",
    "the diffuse emission is elongated in the north - south direction out to @xmath33 ( @xmath34 kpc ) .",
    "the x - ray emission of the cluster extends to at least @xmath35 ( @xmath36 kpc ) , where the background begins to dominate the flux .",
    "there is no apparent substructures in x - rays , which indicates that the cluster has not experienced any major merger events in the recent past , and is likely to be in a relaxed state .",
    "since the astrometric errors of the _ chandra _ observation are about @xmath25 , the position of the x - ray peak ( ra=08h42m56.0s , dec=+29d27m27.2s , j2000 ) is in excellent agreement with the optical center of the cd galaxy 2masx j08425596 + 2927272 ( becker et al .",

    "based on the studies of brandt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we estimate that there may be 510 unrelated x - ray sources in the @xmath38 region of the cluster . by utilizing a wavedetect detection algorithm and a source detection threshold of 10@xmath39 , and then crosschecking the results both by using the celldetect detection algorithm and by eye",
    ", we detected 10 x - ray point sources in @xmath38 , among which less than 1 is expected to be a false detection .",
    "we find that two of them have optical and radio counterparts within @xmath25 .",
    "one is cgcg 150 - 019 , an sb galaxy located at @xmath40 ( wegner et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the other is first j084251.9 + 292825 , a seyfert galaxy in ms 0839.9 + 2938 ( hutchings & edwards 2000 ) . in the analysis that follows , all the detected x - ray point sources were excluded .      in figure 2",
    ", we show the azimuthally - averaged surface brightness profile of the cluster in 0.78 kev that has been corrected with a weighted exposure map .",
    "all the detected point sources have been excluded , while the background has not been subtracted .",
    "we find that in @xmath41 kpc , the observed x - ray surface brightness profile can be well described ( @xmath42 ) by a model consisting of a standard @xmath12 component ( jones & forman 1984 ) and a spatially uniform background as @xmath43^{0.5 - 3\\beta}+s_{\\rm bkg},\\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the core radius , @xmath12 is the slope , @xmath45 is the background , and @xmath46 is the normalization .",
    "the best - fitting parameters are @xmath47 @xmath48 kpc and @xmath49 . however",
    ", when we extrapolate the model inwards , the fit becomes worse ( @xmath50 @xmath48 kpc , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 ) , which significantly underestimates the data in @xmath53 ( @xmath54 kpc ) , leaving an obvious central excess emission above the model .",
    "such central excess emission has been seen in many clusters , e.g. , the centaurus cluster ( ikebe et al .",
    "1999 ) , abell 1795 ( xu et al . 1998 ) , abell 1983 ( pratt & arnaud 2003 ) , and cl0024 + 17 ( ota et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it may be attributed to either a temperature drop , or a metal abundance increase , or an excess of the gas density , all within the central region . in ",
    "5.1 , we will present detailed model fittings to describe the observed x - ray surface brightness profile by taking into account both the temperature and abundance gradients obtained from the spectral analyses (  4 ) .",
    "before the direct spectral fittings , we first study the two - dimensional hardness ratio distribution of the hot diffuse gas in the cluster .",
    "the hardness ratio hr is defined as the ratio of the background - subtracted and exposure - corrected counts in 1.48.0 kev to those in 0.71.4 kev . as can be seen in figure 3 ,",
    "in @xmath55 kpc the hardness ratio is approximately constant at a value of @xmath56 , with typical errors of @xmath57 . assuming an average metallicity of 0.4 solar and the galactic absorption @xmath58 @xmath59 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) , this is consistent with the hardness ratio of an isothermal plasma at @xmath60 kev . in @xmath61 kpc , there are two relatively colder ( 90% confidence level ) regions located at the southeast and northwest of the center , respectively . in the southeast colder region",
    "the gas temperature is estimated to be @xmath62 kev ( hr@xmath63 ) , which is close to that of the gas in the northwest colder region ( @xmath64 kev , hr@xmath65 ) . in @xmath66 kpc , where the hardness ratio is @xmath67 with typical errors of @xmath68",
    ", the gas appears to be significantly colder than in the outer regions , indicating the existence of a plasma at @xmath69 kev .",
    "these results agree very well with those obtained in the detailed spectral fittings (  4.3 ) .",
    "we extracted the total spectrum of the cluster using a circular region filter with a radius of @xmath70 ( @xmath71 kpc ) , which is centered at the x - ray peak , excluding all the detected point sources .",
    "the background spectrum was extracted from a separate region on the s3 chip that is far away enough from the cluster .",
    "we also have used the @xmath72 blank fields for background , and obtained essentially the same results as those shown below . at the boundary of the so defined cluster region , the count flux is about 3 times more than that of the background .",
    "the resulting background - subtracted spectrum contains a total of about 14,100 counts in 0.78.0 kev , showing a strong line feature at @xmath73 kev that corresponds to a rest - frame energy of about 6.7 kev where the k@xmath74 lines of he - like iron should reside .",
    "the appearance of this fe k@xmath74 feature indicates that the average gas temperature of the cluster should be within 2.75.2 kev .",
    "we have fit the spectrum with a model consisting of a single absorbed isothermal component ( table 1 ) .",
    "first we choose the apec model ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ) as the isothermal component , and fix the redshift and absorption to @xmath0 and the galactic value , respectively .",
    "the fit is marginally acceptable ( @xmath75 ) , which gives an average gas temperature of @xmath76 kev , and an average metal abundance of @xmath77 solar . in order to improve the fit we have attempted to apply the vapec model instead of the apec model . for ms 0839.9 + 2938",
    ", the redshift is large enough to move the ly@xmath74 lines of silicon to lower energies to avoid the calibration uncertainties caused by the mirror ir edge .",
    "thus in the fitting , we leave both the fe and si abundances free , and tie the abundance of ni to that of fe . although we have applied the contamination file from the latest caldb to correct for the acis deficiency in low energies , the degradation of energy resolution still does not recover .",
    "for an approximate estimation , we tie the abundances of other @xmath78-elements ( o , ne , mg , s , al , ar and ca ) together .",
    "the model yields a gas temperature of @xmath79 kev , and abundances of @xmath80 solar , @xmath81 solar , and @xmath82 solar that is mostly dominated by the s abundance .",
    "although the vapec fit ( @xmath83 ) is better than the apec fit , there are still residuals remaining at about 0.9 kev , where the model underestimates the data .",
    "these residuals may mostly caused by the excess fe-@xmath20 emissions arising from the colder gas in the central region , whose existence has been inferred in the study of the hardness ratio distribution (  4.1 ) . in either the apec or vapec fitting , even if the absorption is left free , the obtained column density is still consistent with the galactic value , and the fit is not improved .",
    "we also have examined if the fit to the total spectrum can be further improved by the use of a model consisting of two isothermal spectral components , both subjected to a common absorption ( table 1 ) . for this purpose",
    "we employ two vapec components , whose absorption is again fixed to the galactic value because allowing it to vary does not improve the fit .",
    "the metal abundances of each vapec component are grouped in the same way as in the single vapec fitting , and the abundances of the same element of the two vapec components are tied together .",
    "we perform the f - test and find that at the 95% confidence level the two - temperature fit ( @xmath84 ) is better than the one - temperature apec or vapec fit .",
    "the obtained gas temperatures for the two components are @xmath85 kev and @xmath86 kev , and the metal abundances are @xmath87 solar , @xmath88 solar , and @xmath89 solar . with these best - fit parameters",
    "we calculate that the unabsorbed 0.510 kev flux of the cluster is @xmath90 erg @xmath59 s@xmath5 , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath91 erg s@xmath5 .      in order to investigate the temperature and abundance gradients ,",
    "we divided the cluster into five annular regions , all centered at the x - ray peak . as the first step , we study the projected spectra extracted in these annuli . the background spectrum was again extracted in a region on the s3 chip far away enough from the cluster ; the use of the _ chandra _ blank fields yields essentially the same results . assuming that the gas in each annulus is in the thermal equilibrium",
    ", we fit the spectra using a single absorbed apec model with the absorption fixed to the galactic value ; allowing the absorption to vary does not improve the fits .",
    "as is shown in figure 4 and table 2 , the fit is acceptable for each region .",
    "the gas temperature is found to be approximately constant at @xmath92 kev outside about @xmath93 kpc , while it descends to @xmath94 kev in the central @xmath3 kpc , as has been expected in the study of the hardness ratio distribution (  4.1 ) . on the other hand , the average metal abundance , which is mainly determined by iron , increases towards the center from a roughly constant value of 0.4 solar in the outer regions to about 0.8 solar within the central @xmath3 kpc . instead of the apec model ,",
    "we have also attempted to apply the vapec model ( fig . 4 and table 2 ) .",
    "for better statistics , all the abundances of the @xmath78-elements are tied together , and the absorption is again fixed to the galactic value .",
    "we find that the fits are acceptable too , and the obtained gas temperatures agree nicely with those obtained with the apec model . in the regions outside @xmath95 kpc ,",
    "the iron abundance varies slowly in a range of 0.250.42 solar , while in the central region , it increases drastically to about 0.8 solar .",
    "the spatial distribution of the average abundance of the @xmath78-elements , however , is not well determined due to large errors .",
    "next , we perform the deprojected analysis of the spectra extracted in the inner four regions by using the standard `` onion peeling '' method ( fig . 4 and table 2 ) .",
    "assuming that the gas temperature and abundance are uniform in each spherical shell , and that the gas density follows the best - fit profile derived in  5.1 , we subtract emissions from the outer shells projected on the inner shells .",
    "we fit the deprojected spectra with either the apec or vapec model whose absorption is fixed to the galactic value .",
    "we find that the deprojected spectra can be well fitted with either of the models .",
    "the gas temperatures obtained with the apec model agree very well with those obtained with the vapec model , and both the average metal abundance of the apec model and the iron abundance of the vapec model show significant central increase in the innermost region as has been found in the projected analysis .",
    "for each model the best - fit gas temperatures and metal abundances obtained in the projected and deprojected analyses are consistent with each other . in the innermost region ,",
    "the deprojected temperatures are only slightly lower than , but still consistent with the projected values .",
    "as we have shown above , both the projected and deprojected spectral analyses indicate that in ms 0839.9 + 2938 there is a central temperature drop within a radius of about @xmath96 kpc .",
    "according to the deprojected apec fit , the gas temperature descends from @xmath97 kev in @xmath98 kpc to @xmath99 kev in @xmath100 kpc , which can be approximated by a power - law profile @xmath101 , where @xmath102 kev , @xmath103 and @xmath104 kpc ( fig .",
    "4a ) . in the same region where the cold gas is present",
    ", the iron abundance shows a clear tendency to increase . in the projected analysis ,",
    "both the iron - dominated metal abundance of the apec model and the iron abundance of the vapec model in the central @xmath3 kpc region are significantly higher than their counterparts in @xmath105 kpc at the 90% confidence level .",
    "they are also apparently higher than the abundances in @xmath106 kpc and @xmath107 kpc , respectively , with the 90% confidence ranges overlap with each other only slightly . in the deprojected analysis , although the obtained errors are much larger , the average metal abundance and iron abundance still show a tendency to increase inward . at the 90% confidence level ,",
    "their values inferred for the @xmath100 kpc region are significantly higher than those for the @xmath105 kpc region .    in order to crosscheck these results with better statistics ,",
    "we divide the cluster into the inner ( @xmath108 kpc ) and outer ( @xmath109 kpc ) regions , and fit their deprojected spectra with the an absorbed vapec model ( table 3 ) . in the fitting the absorption",
    "is fixed to the galactic value , and the metal abundances are grouped in the same way as in the fittings of the total spectrum .",
    "we find that the fits are acceptable for both regions . at the 90% confidence level , the central temperature decrease and abundance increase can be confirmed .",
    "the silicon abundance and the average abundance of other @xmath78-elements , however , show no tendency to vary between the two regions .",
    "since the iron abundance is determined as much by the fe - l emission lines kev as by the fe - k lines , the obtained inward iron abundance increase might be an artifact , which is actually caused by the enhancement of the fe - l blend due to an inward temperature drop that is even steeper than has been modeled .",
    "we have examined this possibility .",
    "first we exclude the fe-@xmath20 lines completely from the spectra and use the fe-@xmath21 lines only to measure the iron abundance .",
    "the obtained iron abundance does show a tendency to increase inwards , although it is less significant due to poorer statistics .",
    "second , we fit the deprojected spectrum of the innermost region by using a single absorbed vapec model with the absorption fixed to the galactic value and the iron abundance fixed to 0.47 solar ( the upper limit of the iron abundance in the third annular region ; table 2 ) .",
    "we do obtain a lower temperature of @xmath110 kev as is expected .",
    "however , the fit appears to be worse and should be ruled out at the 90% confidence level in terms of f - test , showing obvious spectral residuals in @xmath111 kev as well as at @xmath112 kev , where the fits to the fe-@xmath21 and fe-@xmath20 lines are worse .",
    "this indicates that a central abundance increase is much more preferred than an even steeper temperature gradient .",
    "third , we study the two - dimensional fit - statistic contours of temperature and iron abundance at the 68% , 90% and 99% confidence levels for the innermost region and the third region , respectively , all obtained in the deprojected vapec fitting ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "as can be clearly seen the central iron abundance is higher than that of the third region at a significance of 99% .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the possibility of the detected central iron abundance increase being an artifact should be excluded .",
    "note that the coexistence of the temperature drop and abundance increase may indicate that they are physically correlated , since the higher the metallicity is , the faster the gas cools down .",
    "assuming that 1 ) the gas is ideal and in the thermal equilibrium state , and 2 ) the spatial distribution of the gas is spherically asymmetric , we deduce the three - dimensional gas density distribution @xmath113 by fitting the observed radial x - ray surface brightness profile @xmath114 , which was extracted in 0.78.0 kev , azimuthally - averaged , and exposure - corrected .",
    "the calculations was performed in a projected way by using @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the cooling function calculated by taking into account both the temperature and abundance gradients as is modeled by the best - fit deprojected apec parameters , and @xmath45 is the background .",
    "first we assume that the gas density follows the @xmath12 distribution @xmath117 ^{-3\\beta/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath118 is the core radius and @xmath12 is the slope .",
    "we find @xmath119 kpc and @xmath120 .",
    "the fit , however , is unacceptable ( @xmath121 ) , showing strong residuals in @xmath122 kpc where the model significantly underestimates the data ( fig .",
    "2 ) . in fact , the gas density derived in such a way is lower than that obtained in the deprojected spectral analysis (  4.3 ) by about 45% .",
    "this confirms the result in  3.2 , although the central brightness excess above the model is less prominent since the effects of the central temperature drop and abundance increase are both counted in , which enhance the model emission in the central region .",
    "next we examine if @xmath114 can be reproduced by adopting the universal gravitating mass distribution as has been found in the cosmological n - body simulations ( navarro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the gravitating mass density , @xmath125 is the scale radius , @xmath126 is the critical density of the universe at the observed redshift , and @xmath127 is the characteristic density contract that can be expressed in term of the equivalent concentration parameter _",

    "( 1998 ) and wu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , under the assumptions of 1 ) spherical symmetry , 2 ) hydrostatic equilibrium , and 3 ) ideal and isothermal gas , the gas distribution can be given in an analytic form @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the dimensionless radius , @xmath131 is the index , and @xmath132 is the average molecular weight for a fully ionized gas .",
    "note that in eq.(6 ) a background density at infinity has been subtracted to avoid the divergence in integrating the x - ray emission along the line of sight . as are shown in figure 2 and table 4 .",
    "we find that , comparing with the @xmath12 model , the fit is improved in the central region , giving @xmath133 kpc , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "however , it still systematically underestimates the data in @xmath136 kpc .    in order to improve the fit in the central region ,",
    "we have attempted to add an additional @xmath12 component to the @xmath12 model to account for the central excess emission , for which the gas density distribution is @xmath137 ^{-3\\beta_{1 } }           + n_{g2,0}^{2 } \\left [ 1 + ( r / r_{c2})^{2 } \\right ] ^{-3\\beta_{2 } }             \\right\\ } ^{1/2}.\\ ] ] this empirical two - component model has been successfully applied to many clusters of galaxies as well as some groups of galaxies ( see , e.g. , makishima et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",
    "we find that the model can best fit the observed surface brightness profile throughout the spatial range spanned by the cluster and yield an acceptable fit .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath138 kpc and @xmath139 for one @xmath12 component , which mostly describes the surface brightness profile in the outer region , and @xmath140@xmath48 kpc and @xmath141 for another , which describes the central excess brightness .      the distribution of the diffuse x - ray emission in different energy bands is roughly symmetric outside to about @xmath35 ( @xmath36 kpc ) in ms 0839.9 + 2938 , indicating that the cluster is nearly relaxed .",
    "in this case the x - ray imaging spectroscopy can be considered as a reliable tool to deduce the mass distributions in the cluster .",
    "assuming that the gas is ideal and the cluster is in the hydrostatic equilibrium state , and utilizing the best - fit temperature gradient obtained in the deprojected analyses and the gas density profile deduced with the two-@xmath12 model , we calculate the three - dimensional gravitating mass distribution by using @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the total mass within the radius @xmath144 , g is the gravitational constant , and @xmath145 is the proton mass . here",
    "the effects of non - thermal turbulent , magnetic pressure , and cosmic ray pressure are not taken into account .",
    "the resulting distribution of the total gravitating mass is shown in figure 6 , along with the 90% errors determined by performing the monte - carlo simulations that account for the range of temperature and gas profiles allowed by the data .",
    "the total mass distribution shows an excess beyond that predicted by the @xmath12 model in @xmath146 kpc , which is roughly the optical boundary of the cd galaxy ( nesci et al . 1989 ) and the region where the excess x - ray emission , temperature drop , and iron abundance increase are observed .",

    "the cooling radius @xmath157 , defined as the radius where the cooling time is equal to the age of the universe , is @xmath158 kpc .",
    "this is roughly the radius within which the gas temperature begins to descend inwards .    in order to determine the mass deposit rate of the cooling processes",
    ", we fit the spectrum extracted in the two innermost annuli ( @xmath159 kpc ) where the gas temperature is significantly lower than that of the outer regions .",
    "we use the cooling flow model mkcflow , which is absorbed by a column density fixed to the galactic value ( fig .",
    "we find that when the low temperature @xmath160 of mkcflow is fixed to 0.08 kev , the model yields a rather poor fit to the data ( @xmath161 ) , giving rise to too much cool gas and thus overestimating the data in @xmath162 kev .",
    "when @xmath160 is left free , the fit becomes acceptable ( @xmath163 ) , but it requires @xmath164 kev , which may suggest that the spectrum is dominated by a hot component .",
    "we then add an additional ambient isothermal component ( mekal ) into the model , tying its temperature to @xmath165 of mkcflow .",

    "thus , given the current data quality and instrumental capabilities , the two - phase isothermal model can not be distinguished from the single mkcflow model with a free @xmath160 , or the mekal+mkcflow model .",
    "although not well constrained , the cooling flow model can not be ruled out for this cluster .",
    "the inward iron abundance increase found in many nearby clusters and groups around / in the giant , dominating elliptical galaxy at the center seems to follow a somewhat universal profile .",

    "all these results strongly imply that the observed central iron excess has probably been caused by the same enrichment process associated with the central dominating galaxy , which is a cd galaxy in most cases . meanwhile , the high spatial resolution observations of the nearby giant ellipticals m87 ( matsushita et al . 2003 ) and ngc 5044 ( buote et al .",
    "2003 ) revealed that the spatial distribution of oxygen abundance is approximately uniform out to about 4070 kpc , inferring that the metals synthesized in sne ii are evenly distributed in the cluster / group .",
    "thus , the central iron abundance increase should be ascribed mainly to sne ia .    by performing both the projected and deprojected spectral analyses",
    ", we find that in ms 0839.9 + 2938 the measured average iron abundance is about 0.4 solar in the outer regions , while it increases to @xmath181 solar within the central @xmath182 kpc at the 90% confidence level .",

    "the derived @xmath195 obviously exceeds the iron enrichment caused only by the stellar winds and ram pressure stripping of metal - enriched gas ( e.g. , trager et al .",
    "2000 ; ciotti et al .",
    "therefore , we speculate that a significant part of the excess iron may have been blown into the icm directly by the sn ia explosions .    by reproducing the observed iron - to - silicon abundance ratio in the central @xmath196 kpc of ms 0839.9 + 2938 ( fe / si=@xmath197 solar at the 68% confidence level ) , where a clear iron abundance increase is seen , we have attempted to estimate the sn ia contribution to the iron enrichment .",

    "( 1997 ) , because both models give rise to too much silicon .    using the same method as above we estimate that for the @xmath205 kpc region , where the observed fe / si ratio is @xmath206 solar ( 68% confidence ) , the sn ia contributions is @xmath207 , or @xmath208 ( w7 model ) . by comparing these results with those for the inner region",
