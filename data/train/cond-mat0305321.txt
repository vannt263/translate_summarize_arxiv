    "the segregation of spins and holes into stripelike arrangements appears to be a common feature of doped mott insulators.@xcite these so - called _ stripe correlations _ seem to be of particular importance in understanding the electronic phase diagram of high - temperature superconductors , where a competition between a static stripe phase and the superconducting phase is widely discussed.@xcite such a competition is expected to be reflected by the dynamics of stripes , i.e. , static stripes should reduce the superconducting order parameter while stripes should be fluctuating in the presence of fully developed superconductivity .",
    "indeed , there is growing experimental evidence for such a scenario.@xcite while many experiments give evidence towards static stripes of holes and spins,@xcite signatures of stripe fluctuations currently only comprise magnetic correlations.@xcite a direct observation of fluctuating charge stripes , however , is still missing .",
    "a promising alternative approach to study stripe dynamics involves the phonon heat transport which is an indirect probing method .",
    "since charge stripes lead to lattice distortions , a sensitivity of the phonon heat transport to the dynamics as well as the degree of periodicity of stripes can be expected .",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath5 of doped @xmath6 has repeatedly been the subject of experimental research , yet no detailed understanding of the rather complicated and strong changes of the temperature dependence of @xmath5 upon partial substituting sr and/or small rare earths ( re ) like nd or eu for la has been achieved .",
    "for example , in the antiferromagnetic insulators @xmath7 a huge peak at room temperature which arises due to magnetic heat transport is found in the thermal conductivity parallel to the @xmath8-planes ( @xmath9 ) , while the thermal conductivity perpendicular to the @xmath8-planes ( @xmath10 ) is purely phononic without a high temperature peak.@xcite similarly intriguing is a strong suppression of the phononic low temperature peak in both @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which is found in the superconducting doping levels of @xmath3.@xcite there is a seeming correlation between this suppression and superconductivity because a phononic low temperature peak reappears in overdoped , non - superconducting @xmath3 as well as in @xmath11 , where superconductivity is suppressed in favor of static stripe order.@xcite baberski et al .",
    "@xcite qualitatively explained these observations based on the idea that in superconducting compounds fluctuating stripes provide a new scattering channel for phonons . in recent studies by sun et al .",
    ", such a scattering channel plays an important role in the data interpretation.@xcite    there is clear - cut evidence that in isostructural stripe ordering @xmath12 the phonon thermal conductivity @xmath13 is closely correlated with both the dynamics and the periodicity of stripes : while @xmath13 is almost unaffected in the presence of static and long range ordered stripes , it is strongly suppressed as soon as the stripes become disordered or dynamic.@xcite apparently , in these compounds the thermal conductivity is indeed a probe for stripe correlations .",
    "one might question , however , whether this is true also in the cuprates for two reasons : first , the electron - phonon coupling in the nickelates is much stronger than in the cuprates.@xcite therefore , the effect of stripes on @xmath13 can be expected to be much smaller in the cuprates .",
    "second , from a structural point of view the situation in the nickelates is much simpler than in the cuprates . in the latter",
    "a structural instability exists and as a consequence a number of structural phase transitions occur as a function of temperature as well as of sr- and re - content.@xcite since the structural instability involves soft phonon modes,@xcite enhanced scattering of the heat carrying phonons is likely . in this article",
    "we reinvestigate the phonon thermal conductivity @xmath13 of doped @xmath3 and present new experimental results on eu - doped single crystals .",
    "the single crystalline data allow us to investigate the anisotropy of the @xmath5-tensor and provide more precise absolute values of @xmath5 . in previous measurements on polycrystals@xcite",

    "it is , however , necessary in order to judge the strength and therefore the importance of various scattering mechanisms for phonons .",

    "prior to discussing our new experimental results , we review previous results@xcite on the striking doping dependence of the thermal conductivity of doped @xmath6 . at first",

    "[ fig1 ] , which reproduces @xmath10 of @xmath3 ( @xmath17 , 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , 0.3 ) as published by nakamura et al.,@xcite this peak evolves non - monotonically with increasing sr - content : a well pronounced phononic low-@xmath18 peak in @xmath10 is only present at @xmath17 and @xmath27 , whereas at intermediate doping levels ( @xmath28 ) a peak structure is hardly identifyable .",
    "note that the material is a superconductor in this doping range whereas it is insulating and metallic at @xmath17 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "baberski et al . have pointed out that the suppressed low-@xmath18 peak at intermediate sr - doping reappears upon re - doping , provided that this doping induces the so - called ltt - phase ( low temperature tetragonal ) and thereby suppresses superconductivity.@xcite this is illustrated in the upper panel of fig .  [ fig1 ] , where @xmath5 of polycrystalline pr- and nd- doped @xmath14 at the finite sr - content @xmath29 is shown .",
    "the pr - doped compound does not undergo the transition to the ltt - phase . like @xmath3 ,",
    "it remains in the so - called lto - phase ( low temperature orthorhombic ) and is a superconductor.@xcite its thermal conductivity monotonically decreases with decreasing @xmath18 and hence is very similar to the aforementioned findings by nakamura et al . for @xmath5 of @xmath3 at @xmath28 .",
    "the situation is completely different in the non superconducting , nd - doped compound , which is in the ltt - phase below @xmath30  k : here , @xmath13 abruptly enhances at @xmath2 and exhibits a well pronounced phononic peak around 25  k.    the doping dependence of @xmath5 described above must be attributed to strong changes in the phonon thermal conductivity @xmath13 of this material : non - phononic contributions to @xmath5 can be excluded in the out - of - plane direction , since the electrical conductivity@xcite and the magnetic coupling@xcite along the @xmath31-axis are too small to allow significant electronic and magnetic thermal conduction .",
    "concomitantly , the doping dependence of the low-@xmath18 peak is evident along all crystal directions@xcite ( c.f . also the data below ) .    in crystalline materials ,",
    "the low-@xmath18 peak in @xmath13 is very sensitive to scattering of phonons .",
    "generally , the height of this peak reduces with increasing phonon scattering rates .",
    "one important mechanism in this regard is scattering of phonons by impurities . in alloyed compounds like doped @xmath6 this phonon - impurity scattering",
    "is induced by non - uniform ions on one lattice site . upon alloying",
    ", this should lead to a gradual reduction of the phonon peak.@xcite even though phonon - defect scattering inevitably must be present in this material , it is not a scattering mechanism which solely dominates @xmath13 , because the phonon peak evolves non - monotonically upon sr - doping and even reappears at additional re - doping .",
    "another scattering mechanism for phonons in this material is suggested by the abrupt change of @xmath13 at the structural phase transition , which occurs in the nd - doped compound .",
    "it appears that phonons are scattered stronger in the lto - phase .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by neutron scattering studies on nd - doped @xmath3 at @xmath2 : the acoustic phonon line width abruptly decreases at the transition from the lto- into the ltt - phase , signaling a proportional decrease of scattering processes.@xcite anomalous phonon thermal conductivity in the vicinity of structural phase transitions is well known from a number of perovskite oxides as , for example , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "there , a suppression of @xmath13 is caused by enhanced scattering of acoustic phonon modes due to their energetic degeneracy with soft optical phonon modes.@xcite indeed , soft phonon branches do exist in the lto - phase of doped @xmath34,@xcite which could cause a suppression of @xmath13 ( in the following this scattering mechanism will briefly be named soft - phonon scattering ) .",
    "the change of @xmath13 at @xmath2 then would follow from the discontinuous hardening of the soft phonon branch in the ltt - phase@xcite and an associated reduced scattering rate of acoustic phonons.@xcite    since all compounds with a suppressed phonon peak are in the lto - phase at low @xmath18 , soft - phonon scattering could be important for understanding the suppression of the peak as well.@xcite there is , however , not a one to one correlation between the lto - phase , i.e. , the possible presence of soft phonon scattering , and the suppression of the peak .",
    "this is most obvious in @xmath3 , because the soft phonon properties only slightly change for @xmath35 , whereas the phonon peak is maximum for @xmath6 .",
    "baberski et al . have noticed that both impurity scattering and soft - phonon scattering separately do not allow to understand the suppression of the phonon peak .",
    "they therefore suggested , that the suppression of the phononic peak could be correlated with the superconducting properties , since the peak suppression occurs whenever the material is superconducting.@xcite in their model , they proposed that stripes couple to phonons and thereby cause an unconventional scattering mechanism for phonons depending on the dynamics of stripes : a suppression of the phonon peak then is the consequence of fluctuating stripes , which are present in the superconducting compounds , while @xmath13 exhibits a usual phonon peak when stripes are static or even absent in the non - superconducting cases . there , static stripes are only present in the ltt - phase .",
    "therefore , instead of being caused by an abrupt softening of optical phonon modes , the jump of @xmath13 at @xmath2 could just as well originate from a change of the stripe dynamics from static ( ltt ) to fluctuating ( lto ) .",
    "even though a consistent interpretation of the data discussed afore is possible within such a model , its validity is questionable because the actual role of impurity- and soft - phonon scattering remains unclear .",
    "in order to elucidate the importance of this conventional scattering mechanisms we now turn to our measurements on single crystals , which provide profound information in this regard .    thermal conductivity of @xmath0 [ @xmath17 , 0.08 , 0.15 , 0.2 , panels ( a ) to ( d ) ] along the @xmath31-axis ( @xmath10 , open circles ) and parallel to the ab - planes ( @xmath9 , closed circles ) as a function of temperature .",

    ", @xmath55 monotonically increases upon heating in the entire temperature range . at @xmath56",
    "k no anomaly is present , neither in @xmath9 nor in @xmath10 .",
    "apparently , the transition at @xmath57 also causes no anomaly in the thermal conductivity .",
    "as mentioned before , @xmath10 is purely phononic , since electronic and magnetic contributions can be ruled out for heat transport along the @xmath31-axis . in order to understand the anisotropies of @xmath5 for @xmath49  k , it is reasonable to distinguish the cases @xmath17 and @xmath58 . it has been shown in ref .",
    "18 that in insulating , antiferromagnetic @xmath53 the high temperature peak of @xmath9 must be explained by magnetic contributions . upon sr - doping ,",
    "the doped holes destroy the magnetic order which leads to a strong suppression of the high temperature peak ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "simultaneously , the material becomes electrically conducting within the @xmath38-planes.@xcite therefore , the much smaller , but apparently still existing anisotropy in the sr - doped compounds is due to electronic , rather than magnetic , contributions to @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , an estimation using the wiedemann - franz - law yields electronic contributions of the same order of magnitude as the observed anisotropy for @xmath9 and negligible electronic contributions for @xmath10 .",
    "the magnetic and electronic contributions to @xmath9 become important for @xmath49  k. below this temperature , @xmath9 can be considered to be primarily phononic with a similar magnitude of @xmath13 as @xmath10.@xcite this is nicely confirmed by the very similar temperature dependence of @xmath9 and @xmath10 in this temperature range , as shown in fig .",
    "it is remarkable that for all compounds the phonon peak of @xmath10 is slightly larger than that of @xmath9 as long as a peak is clearly resolved in both quantities .",
    "a possible explanation could be related to slightly different velocities of the acoustic phonons along the @xmath38- and @xmath31-directions.@xcite    doping dependence of low temperature peak in the thermal conductivity of @xmath59 along the @xmath31-axis ( @xmath10 , top ) and parallel to the ab - planes ( @xmath9 , bottom ) .",
    "inset : doping dependence of the jump size @xmath60 at @xmath2 . ]      the development of the low temperature peak of @xmath13 upon doping can be viewed in fig .",
    "obviously , the peak size is gradually reduced as the sr - content increases .",
    "a similar result is found for the size of the jump @xmath60 at @xmath2 which is shown as a function of doping in the inset of fig .",
    "while the gradual reduction of the peak size can straightforwardly be explained by phonon - impurity scattering , the reduction of the jump at @xmath2 requires further comments .",
    "first of all , we stress the presence of a jump in insulating @xmath61 .",
    "it clearly proofs that it is caused by soft - phonon scattering in the lto - phase , which therefore has to be regarded as an important scattering channel for phonons indeed . when this scattering channel becomes active in the lto - phase , the relative importance of phonon - impurity scattering is reduced .",
    "the gradual reduction of the jump size @xmath60 with increasing sr - content may therefore be attributed to doping induced phonon - impurity scattering as well .",
    "however , we should note that the structural differences between the ltt and lto - phases diminish with increasing sr - content . therefore , apart from phonon - impurity scattering , structural reasons play a role in the suppression of the jump at @xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with the observation by baberski et al .",
    ", that the jump disappears , whenever the tilting angle of the @xmath62-octahedra becomes lower than a critical value.@xcite    it is now very instructive to consider @xmath13 of pure @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) for comparison .",
    "apparently , doping sr into @xmath6 suppresses the phonon peak much more effectively than in the eu - doped counterpart : on the one hand the phonon peak of non - doped @xmath6 is by a factor of about two larger than in non - doped @xmath61 . on the other hand",
    "the phonon peaks in @xmath59 are clearly better developed for finite sr - contents with higher maximum values as in @xmath3 .",
    "one has therefore to conclude that a further scattering mechanism exists in @xmath3 which becomes more important upon doping and which is absent or at least much weaker in the eu - doped compounds . in this case , this mechanism must cause a more effective scattering than the surely present phonon - impurity scattering induced by the eu - ions .",
    "one plausible candidate ( besides scattering due to dynamic stripes ) for such a mechanism is soft - phonon scattering connected with the structural instability of the lto - phase since the soft - phonon energies decrease further upon sr - doping@xcite and hence enhance soft - phonon scattering .    in order to judge",
    "the relevance of soft - phonon scattering a measure for its strength with respect to phonon - impurity scattering is necessary .",
    "such a measure could be achieved , for example , by comparison with a compound where neither a lattice instability nor doped impurities are present .",
    "though being no cuprate , isostructural @xmath4 is yet a well suited candidate perfectly fulfilling these requirements .",
    "the phonon spectra of @xmath6 and @xmath4 are almost identical@xcite because the atomic masses of ni and cu are very similar . at low temperatures ( @xmath63  k )",
    "this compound is in the ltt - phase and hence a structural instability does not exist.@xcite moreover , no phonon - impurity scattering is present in this non - doped compound .",
    "temperature dependence of @xmath9 of @xmath4 in comparison with @xmath9 of @xmath6 and @xmath61 .",
    "the data for @xmath6 are reproduced from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "[ fig4 ] presents our result for phononic@xcite @xmath9 of electrically insulating @xmath4 in comparison with @xmath9 of @xmath6 as measured by nakamura et al . and with @xmath9 of @xmath61 .",
    "it is intriguing that the phonon peak of @xmath4 is about one order of magnitude larger than the peak in both @xmath6 and @xmath61 . at @xmath64",
    "k , the structure changes from ltt to lto , which also in this material causes a jumplike decrease in the thermal conductivity .",
    "compared to @xmath61 the jump size is larger by a factor of about 10 . in the lto - phase ,",
    "@xmath9 is of the similar size as in @xmath6 .",
    "it immediately follows from this observation that in @xmath6 as well as in @xmath65 the heat carrying phonons are subject of severe scattering at low temperatures . in both cases",
    "this scattering obviously suppresses the peak of @xmath13 by about one order of magnitude .",
    "translated to the strength of the two discussed scattering mechanisms this means that referring to a non - impurity - doped ltt - phase both soft - phonon scattering and phonon - impurity scattering independently of each other reduce the peak of @xmath13 by almost the same amount .",
    "this conclusion now allows us to understand the doping dependence of the phonon peak , when a combination of both , phonon - impurity- and soft - phonon scattering is consired : in @xmath59 , where the thermal conductivity is already strongly influenced by the eu - ions , sr - doping simply further increases the phonon - impurity scattering rate .",
    "this consequently leads to a gradual reduction of the phonon peak with increasing sr - content .",
    "soft - phonon scattering is not relevant here .    in @xmath3 with the same sr - content than a eu - doped counterpart ,",
    "the phonon - impurity scattering rate is slightly reduced since no eu - ions are present .",
    "yet , the resulting phonon thermal conductivity is somewhat smaller .",
    "hence , the effect of a slightly reduced phonon - impurity scattering rate must be overcompensated by soft - phonon scattering .",
    "this is indeed reasonable since it is a qualitatively different scattering mechanism whose importance upon sr - doping grows since thereby the relevant soft modes soften further.@xcite    the reappearance of the phonon peak in @xmath3 at high sr - concentrations as @xmath27 can now be understood as a natural consequence of the doping dependence of @xmath57 . for @xmath66 , the lto - phase disappears in @xmath3 and the structure remains in the htt - phase for all temperatures.@xcite hence , for @xmath27 soft - phonon scattering associated with the lto - phase is not active for such overdoped compounds .",
    "the result of such decreased phonon scattering is the reappearance of the phonon peak .",
    "it is necessary to mention that the growing density of holes as the sr - content is increased in principle could be a further source of scattering and therefore contribute to the reduction of @xmath13 and in particular the phonon peak via phonon - electron scattering .",
    "however , since the transition to superconductivity in @xmath3 causes no significant anomaly in @xmath10 at @xmath67 ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fig1 ] ) , this scattering mechanism is usually considered to be unimportant in this material and its ( re)-doped relatives.@xcite yet if this scattering channel is active in this material no inconsistency to our interpretation arises because in this case the phonon-impurity scattering induced by sr - ions can be regarded simply as slightly more effective than the phonon - impurity scattering induced by eu - ions .      the above discussion of @xmath13 of the insulating materials @xmath15 , @xmath61 and @xmath4 provides unambiguous evidence that phonon - impurity and soft - phonon scattering are important scattering mechanisms for phonons in doped @xmath15 . since the major doping dependencies of the low-@xmath18 peak can be explained based on these mechanisms without any problems , there is no compelling reason to incorporate a stripe induced scattering channel in the data interpretation .",
    "it is unlikely though that stripes in doped @xmath15 have no effect at all on @xmath13 because the aforementioned stripe - induced phonon scattering in the nickelates@xcite is an unambiguous physical fact .",
    "however , it appears extremely difficult to prove the existence and to study the strength of purely stripe induced scattering in doped @xmath15 via @xmath13 .",
    "this is not only because phonon - impurity and soft - phonon scattering are already dominating @xmath13 in insulating @xmath15 ; due to the intimate relation of ltt - phase and stripe dynamics , scattering on fluctuating stripes in the sr - doped compounds could be viewed as an altered but already existing soft - phonon scattering , i.e. , from this point of view these two scattering mechanisms are conceptually indistinguishable .      for completeness",
    ", we briefly mention the unusual temperature dependence of @xmath10 which is evident at higher temperatures @xmath68  k. instead of a decrease as @xmath69 , which at elevated temperatures is usually expected for thermal conductivity by _ acoustic _ phonons , @xmath37 is almost temperature independent or even increases with rising @xmath18 . as has been shown in ref .",
    "60 , this strong deviation from the usual behavior arises due to thermal conduction by dispersive _ optical _ phonons in addition to the usual contribution by acoustic phonons .",
    "in summary , we have presented experimental results on the thermal conductivity of @xmath0 for a wide doping range of sr .",
    "the analysis of our data suggests that in this material phonons are strongly scattered on the doped impurities , i.e. , sr and eu , as well as on soft phonons that are present in the lto - phase of this material .",
    "comparison of our data with the thermal conductivity of @xmath3 and isostructural @xmath4 leads to the conclusion that these scattering mechanisms are most relevant in @xmath3 as well .",
