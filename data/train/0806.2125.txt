    "gravitational waves offer a rich , unexplored source of information about the universe @xcite .",
    "many phenomena can only be explored with gravitational , not electromagnetic , radiation .",
    "these include accepted sources such as white dwarf , neutron star , or black hole binaries whose observation could provide useful data on astrophysics and general relativity .",
    "it has even been proposed that these compact binaries could be used as standard sirens to determine astronomical distances and possibly the expansion rate of the universe more precisely @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves could also be one of the only ways to learn about the early universe before the surface of last scattering .",
    "there are many speculative cosmological sources including inflation and reheating , early universe phase transitions , and cosmic strings .",
    "for all these applications , it is important to be able to observe gravitational waves as broadly and over as large a range of frequencies and amplitudes as possible .    in this article",
    "we expand on a previous article @xcite , giving the details of our proposal for an atomic gravitational wave interferometric sensor ( agis ) .",
    "we develop proposals for two experiments , one terrestrial , the other satellite - based .",
    "we will see that , at least in the configurations proposed here , it is primarily useful for observing gravitational waves with frequencies between about @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , the terrestrial experiment is sensitive to gravitational waves with frequencies @xmath8 , below the range of any other terrestrial gravitational wave detector .",
    "this arises in part from the vast reduction in systematics available with atom interferometers but impossible with laser interferometers .",
    "the satellite - based experiment will have peak sensitivity to gravitational waves in the @xmath9 band .",
    "the use of atomic interferometry also leads to a natural reduction in many systematic backgrounds , allowing such an experiment to reach sensitivities comparable to and perhaps better than lisa s with reduced engineering requirements .",
    "the ability to detect gravitational waves in such a low frequency band greatly affects the potential sources .",
    "binary stars live much longer and are more numerous at these frequencies than in the higher band around 100 hz where they are about to merge .",
    "stochastic gravitational waves from cosmological sources can also be easier to detect at these low frequencies .",
    "these sources are usually best described in terms of the fractional energy density , @xmath10 , that they produce in gravitational waves .",
    "the energy density of a gravitational wave scales quadratically with frequency ( as @xmath11 ) .",
    "thus , a type of source that produces a given energy density is easier to detect at lower frequencies because the amplitude of the gravitational wave is higher .",
    "this makes low frequency experiments particularly useful for observing cosmological sources of gravitational waves .",
    "there are several exciting proposed and existing experiments to search for gravitational waves including broad - band laser interferometers such as ligo and lisa , resonant bar detectors @xcite , and microwave cavity detectors @xcite .",
    "searching for gravitational waves with atomic interferometry is motivated by the rapid advance of this technology in recent years .",
    "atom interferometers have been used for many high precision applications including atomic clocks @xcite , metrology , gyroscopes @xcite , gradiometers @xcite , and gravimeters @xcite .",
    "we consider the use of such previously demonstrated technology to achieve the sensitivity needed to observe gravitational waves .",
    "further , we consider technological advances in atom interferometry that are currently being explored , including in the stanford 10 m interferometer , and the possible impact these will have on the search for gravitational waves .",

    "we propose to search for gravitational waves using light pulse atom interferometry . in a light pulse atom interferometer",
    ", an atom is forced to follow a superposition of two spatially and temporally separated free - fall paths .",
    "this is accomplished by coherently splitting the atom wavefunction with a pulse of light that transfers momentum to a part of the atom . when the atom is later recombined , the resulting interference pattern depends on the relative phase accumulated along the two paths .",
    "this phase shift results from both the free - fall evolution of the quantum state along each path as well as from the local phase of the laser which is imprinted on the atom during each of the light pulses .",
    "consequently , the phase shift is exquisitely sensitive to inertial forces present during the interferometer sequence , since it precisely compares the motion of the atom to the reference frame defined by the laser phase fronts .",
    "equivalently , the atom interferometer phase shift can be viewed as a clock comparison between the time kept by the laser s phase evolution and the atom s own internal clock .",
    "sensitivity to gravitational waves may be understood as arising from this time comparison , since the presence of space - time strain changes the light travel time between the atom and the laser .",
    "a single phase measurement in an atom interferometer consists of three steps : atom cloud preparation , interferometer pulse sequence , and detection . in the first step ,",
    "the cold atom cloud is prepared . using laser cooling and",
    "perhaps evaporative cooling techniques @xcite , a sub - microkelvin cloud of atoms is formed .",
    "cold atom clouds are needed so that as many atoms as possible will travel along the desired trajectory and contribute to the signal .",
    "in addition , many potential systematic errors ( see sections [ sec : earth backgrounds ] and [ sec : space backgrounds ] ) are sensitive to the atom s initial conditions , so cooling can mitigate these unwanted effects . at the end of the cooling procedure , the final cloud has a typical density which is low enough so that atom - atom interactions within the cloud are negligible ( for example see section v d of @xcite ) .",
    "this dilute ensemble of cold atoms is then launched with velocity @xmath12 by transferring momentum from laser light . to avoid heating the cloud during launch ,",
    "the photon recoil momenta are transferred to the atoms coherently , and spontaneous emission is avoided @xcite .    in the second phase of the measurement ,",
    "the atoms follow free - fall trajectories and the interferometry is performed .",
    "a sequence of laser pulses serve as beamsplitters and mirrors that coherently divide each atom s wavepacket and then later recombine it to produce the interference .",

    "figure [ fig : raman ] shows the case of a raman transition in which the initial and final states are different internal atomic energy levels .",
    "the light fields entangle the internal and external degrees of freedom of the atom , resulting in an energy level change and a momentum kick . as an alternative to this ,",
    "it is also possible to use bragg transitions in which momentum is transferred to the atom while the internal atomic energy level stays fixed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : braggenergylevels ] ) . in both the raman and bragg scheme ,",
    "the two lasers are far detuned from the optical transitions , resulting in a negligibly small occupancy of the excited state @xmath16 .",

    "a final beamsplitter pulse applied at time @xmath28 interferes these overlapping components at the intersection point of the two paths . in this work",
    "we primarily consider this beamsplitter - mirror - beamsplitter @xmath29 sequence @xcite , the simplest implementation of an accelerometer and the matter - wave analog of a mach - zender interferometer .",
    "the third and final step of each measurement is atom detection . at the end of the interferometer sequence ,",
    "each atom is in a superposition of the two output velocity states , as shown by the diverging paths at the top of fig .",
    "[ fig : ai - singleinterferometer ] . since these two states differ in velocity by @xmath30 , they spatially separate . after an appropriate drift time",
    ", the two paths can be separately resolved , and the populations are then measured by absorption imaging .",
    "these two final velocity states are directly analogous to the two output ports of a mach - zehnder light interferometer after the final recombining beamsplitter . as with a light interferometer ,",
    "the probability that an atom will be found in a particular output port depends on the relative phase acquired along the two paths of the atom interferometer .    to explore the potential reach of ai - based gravitational wave detectors , we consider progressive phase sensitivities that are likely to be feasible in the near future .",

    "average atom flux of @xmath31 , the resulting phase sensitivity is @xmath32 .",
    "for example , modern light pulse atom interferometers of the type considered here achieve an atom flux at this level by periodically launching @xmath33 atoms per shot at a repetition rate of @xmath34 . for our most aggressive terrestrial proposal , we assume quantum projection noise  limited detection of @xmath35 per shot at a repetition rate of @xmath36 , implying a phase sensitivity of @xmath37 . in the satellite - based proposal",
    "we assume @xmath35 per shot with a @xmath38 repetition rate , yielding @xmath39 .",
    "cold atom clouds with @xmath40 to @xmath41 atoms are readily produced using modern laser cooling techniques @xcite .",
    "however , the challenges in this application are to cool to the required narrow velocity distribution and to do so in a short enough time to support a high repetition rate . as discussed in sections [ sec : earth backgrounds ] and [",
    "sec : space backgrounds ] , suppression of velocity - dependent backgrounds requires rms velocity widths as small as @xmath42 , corresponding to 1d cloud temperatures of @xmath43 . the required @xmath42 wide cloud could conceivably be extracted from a very large ( @xmath44 atoms ) @xmath45-temperature thermal cloud by applying a highly velocity - selective cut and [ sec : space backgrounds ] for specific velocity width requirements . ] , or by using evaporative cooling techniques . in either case ,",
    "low densities are desirable to mitigate possible systematic noise sources associated with cold collisions .",
    "the repetition rate required for each proposal is a function of the gravitational wave signal frequency range that the experiment probes . on earth ,",
    "a @xmath36 repetition rate is necessary to avoid under - sampling signals in the target frequency band of @xmath8 .",
    "the satellite experiment we consider is sensitive to the @xmath9 band , so a @xmath38 rate is sufficient .",
    "however , in both cases , multiple interferometers must be overlapped in time since the duration of a single interferometer sequence ( @xmath46 for earth , @xmath47 for space ) exceeds the time between shots .",
    "section [ sec : space fd limit ] discusses the logistics of simultaneously manipulating a series of temporally overlapping interferometers and describes the implications for atom detection .",
    "sensor noise performance can potentially be improved by using squeezed atom states instead of uncorrelated thermal atom ensembles @xcite . for a suitably entangled source ,",

    "the potential sensitivity improvement is @xmath51 .",
    "recent progress using these techniques may soon make improvements in @xmath52 on the order of 10 to 100 realistic @xcite .",
    "even squeezing by factor of @xmath53 can potentially relax the atom number requirements by @xmath54 .",
    "another sensitivity improvement involves the use of more sophisticated atom optics .",
    "the phase sensitivity to gravitational waves is proportional to the effective momentum @xmath55 transferred to the atom during interactions with the laser .",

    "figure [ fig : braggenergylevels ] illustrates an example of an lmt process consisting of a series of sequential two  photon bragg transitions as may be realized in an optical lattice . as the atom accelerates , the resonance condition is maintained by increasing the frequency difference between the lasers .",
    "finally , we consider the acceleration sensitivity of the atom interferometer gravitational wave detectors proposed here .",
    "the intrinsic sensitivity of the atom interferometer to inertial forces makes it necessary to tightly constrain many time - dependent perturbing accelerations , since background acceleration inputs in the relevant frequency band can not be distinguished from the gravitational wave signal of interest .",
    "the theoretical maximum acceleration sensitivity of the apparatus follows from the shot - noise limited phase sensitivity discussed above , combined with the well - known acceleration response of the atom interferometer , @xmath59 : @xmath60 where the total signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath61 for a detected atom flux of @xmath62 atoms per second during an averaging time @xmath63 . for the terrestrial apparatus",
    "we propose , the resulting sensitivity in terms of the gravitational acceleration @xmath64 of the earth is @xmath65 . likewise , in the satellite experiment",
    "the acceleration sensitivity is @xmath66 .",
    "the sum of all perturbing acceleration noise sources must be kept below these levels in order for the apparatus to reach its theoretical noise limit .",
    "sections [ sec : earth backgrounds ] and [ sec : space backgrounds ] identify many of these potential backgrounds and discusses the requirements necessary to control them .",
    "in this section we will discuss the details of the calculation of the phase shift in an atom interferometer due to a passing gravitational wave .",
    "this calculation follows the method for a relativistic calculation discussed in @xcite .",
    "the method itself will not be reviewed here , only its application to a gravitational wave and the properties of the resultant phase shift will be discussed . for the rest of the paper ,",
    "only the answer from this calculation is necessary .",
    "we will see that the signal of a gravitational wave in the interferometer is an oscillatory phase shift with frequency equal to the gravitational wave s frequency that scales with the length between the laser and the atom interferometer .",
    "intuitively the atom interferometer can be thought of as precisely comparing the time kept by the laser s clock ( the laser s phase ) , and the time kept by the atom s clock ( the atom s phase ) .",
    "a passing gravitational wave changes the normal flat space relation between these two clocks by a factor proportional to the distance between them .",
    "this change oscillates in time with the frequency of the gravitational wave .",
    "this is the signal that can be looked for with an atom interferometer .",
    "equivalently , the atom interferometer can be thought of as a way of laser ranging the atom s motion to precisely measure its acceleration .",
    "calculating the acceleration that would be seen by laser ranging a test mass some distance away in the metric of the gravitational wave shows a similar oscillatory acceleration in time , and this is the signal of a gravitational wave in an atom interferometer .",
    "this radar ranging calculation gives essentially the same answer as the full atom interferometer calculation in this case .",
    "for the full atom interferometer calculation we will consider the following metric for a plane gravitational wave traveling in the @xmath67-direction @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the frequency of the wave , @xmath70 is its dimensionless strain , and @xmath71 is an arbitrary initial phase .",
    "note that this metric is only approximate , valid to linear order in @xmath70 .",
    "this choice of coordinates for the gravitational wave is known as the  + \" polarization in the tt gauge . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider a 1-dimensional atom interferometer with its axis along the @xmath72-direction .",
    "an orientation for the interferometer along the @xmath72- or @xmath73-axes gives a maximal signal amplitude , while along the @xmath67-axis gives zero signal .",
    "we will work throughout only to linear order in @xmath70 and up to quadratic order in all velocities .",
    "these approximations are easily good enough since even the largest gravitational waves we will consider have @xmath74 and the atomic velocities in our experiment are at most @xmath75 . for simplicity we take @xmath76 .",
    "the total phase shift in the interferometer is the sum of three parts : the propagation phase , the laser interaction phase , and the final wavepacket separation phase .",
    "the usual formulae for these must be modified in gr to be coordinate invariants .",
    "our calculation has been discussed in detail in @xcite . here",
    "we will only briefly summarize how to apply that formalism to a gravitational wave metric .",
    "the space - time paths of the atoms and lasers are geodesics of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : gw metric tt gauge ] .",
    "the propagation phase is @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the lagrangian and the integral is along the atom s geodesic .",
    "the separation phase is taken as @xmath79 where , for coordinate independence , the integral is over the null geodesic connecting the classical endpoints of the two arms of the interferometer , and @xmath80 is the average of the classical 4-momenta of the two arms after the third pulse .",
    "the laser phase shift due to interaction with the light is the constant phase of the light along its null geodesic , which is its phase at the time it leaves the laser .",
    "we will make use of the fact that the laser phase in the atom interferometer comes entirely from the second laser , the ` passive laser ' , which is taken to be always on so it does not affect the timing of the interferometer .",
    "instead the first laser , the ` control laser ' , defines the time at which the atom - light interaction vertices occur . for a more complete discussion of this point ,",
    "see section 3 of @xcite .    in practice",
    ", we will consider the atom interferometer to be 1-dimensional so that the atoms and light move only in the @xmath72-direction and remain at a constant @xmath81 .",
    "this is not an exact solution of the geodesic equation for metric . in the full solution",
    "the atoms and light are forced to move slightly in the @xmath67-direction because of the @xmath67 in @xmath82 .",
    "however the amplitude of this motion is proportional to @xmath70 which will mean that it only has effects on the calculation at @xmath83 .",
    "this was shown by a full interferometer calculation in two dimensions .",
    "it can also be understood intuitively since all displacements , velocities , and accelerations in the second dimension are @xmath84 .",
    "the separation phase is then @xmath85 .",
    "the extra @xmath67 piece of propagation phase is @xmath86 .",
    "changes to the calculated @xmath72 and @xmath87 coordinates and to @xmath82 will also be @xmath83 so propagation phase is only affected at this level by the motion in the @xmath67 direction .",
    "finally , if the laser phase fronts are flat in the @xmath67 dimension as they travel in the @xmath72 direction then there will be no affect of the displacement in the @xmath67 direction .",
    "however the phase fronts can not be made perfectly flat and so there will be an @xmath84 effect of the displacement in the @xmath67 direction times the amount of bending of the laser phase fronts .",
    "this is clearly much smaller than the leading @xmath84 signal from the gravitational wave and so we will ignore it since we are primarily interested in calculating the signal .",
    "the lasers will be taken to be at the origin and at spatial position ( @xmath88,0,0 ) .",
    "we can make this choice because a fixed spatial coordinate location is a geodesic of metric . without loss of generality , we take the initial position of the atom to lie on the null geodesic originating from the origin ( the first beamsplitter pulse ) with @xmath89 .",
    "of course , this means that @xmath90 is not a physically measurable variable but is instead a coordinate dependent choice .",
    "the results are still fully correct in terms of @xmath90 and the interpretation will also be clear because the coordinate dependence only enters at @xmath84 .",
    "since , as we will see , the leading order piece of the signal being computed is @xmath84 , this ambiguity can only have an @xmath83 effect on the answer .",
    "we can ignore this and consider @xmath90 to be the physical length between the atom s initial position and the laser , by any reasonable definition of this length .",
    "similar reasoning allows us to define the initial launch velocity of the atoms at @xmath90 as the coordinate velocity @xmath91 .",
    "the ability to ignore the @xmath84 corrections to the coordinate expressions for quantities such as the initial position and velocity of the atoms relies on the fact that this is a null experiment so the leading order piece of the phase shift is proportional to @xmath70 .    with the choices above we find the geodesics of metric",
    "are given as functions of the proper time @xmath63 by @xmath92 to linear order in @xmath70 where @xmath93 is 0 for null geodesics and 1 for time - like geodesics .",
    "the leading order pieces of these are just the normal trajectories in flat space .    using these trajectories ,",
    "the intersection points can be calculated and the final phase shift found as in the general method laid out in @xcite . here",
    "the relevant equations are made solvable by expanding always to first order in @xmath70 .",
    "note that here the use of the local lorentz frame to calculate the atom - light interactions is unnecessary .",
    "the interaction rules are applied at one space - time point so the local curvature of the space is irrelevant .",
    "further , the choice of boost ( the velocity of the frame ) can only make corrections of @xmath94 to the transferred momentum , giving a @xmath95 correction to the overall velocity of the atom , which is negligible .    to define the lasers frequencies in a physically meaningful way as in @xcite",
    ", we take each laser to have a frequency , @xmath96 , given in terms of the coordinate momenta of the light by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the four - velocity of an observer at the position of the laser . the momenta of the light is then changed by the gravitational wave as it propagates and the kick it gives to the atom is given by its momenta at the point of interaction .      following the method above",
    ", the phase difference seen in the atom interferometer in metric is shown in table [ tab : phases ] .",
    "as in figure [ fig : ai - singleinterferometer ] , the lasers are taken to be a distance @xmath88 apart , with the atom initially a distance @xmath99 from the left laser and moving with initial velocity @xmath12 .",
    "the left laser is the control laser and the right is the passive laser , as defined above .",

    "this arises from the choice of laser 2 as the passive laser which is always on and laser 1 as the control laser which defines the timing of the beamsplitter and mirror interactions .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the laser phase from laser 1 is zero and the main effect then arises from the laser phase of laser 2 and so is proportional to @xmath24 . under certain conditions , this term is proportional to the baseline length , @xmath88 , between the lasers ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn : gw phase expand ] ) .",
    "the effect of a gravitational wave is always proportional to a length scale .",
    "the second term in table [ tab : phases ] is not proportional to the distance @xmath88 between the lasers , but is proportional to the distance the atom travels during the interferometer @xmath105 .",
    "thus it can not be increased by scaling the laser baseline .",
    "instead it depends on the size of the region available for the atomic fountain , which is more difficult to increase experimentally .",
    "thus this term will likely be several orders of magnitude smaller than the first term in a practical experimental setup , as seen in table [ tab : phases ] .",
    "this @xmath106 term is essentially the same term that has been found by previous authors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we will not use this term for the signal in our proposed experiment as it is smaller than the first term .",
    "the second term can be loosely understood from the intuition that the type of atom interferometer being considered is an accelerometer . in the frame",
    "in which the lasers are stationary , this atom interferometer configuration is usually said to respond to the acceleration @xmath107 of the atom with a phase shift @xmath108 . in this frame , the motion of the atom in the presence of a gravitational wave ( metric ) appears to have a coordinate acceleration @xmath109 .",
    "this would then give a phase shift @xmath110 which is approximately the second term in table [ tab : phases ] .",
    "of course , this is clearly coordinate - dependent intuition and will not work in a different coordinate system .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting that this ` accelerometer ' term arises in a fully relativistic , coordinate - invariant calculation .",
    "the third term in table [ tab : phases ] is essentially the same as the first term , but with @xmath24 replaced by @xmath101 since it arises from the difference in rest masses between the two atomic states .",
    "we are considering a raman transition between two nearly degenerate ground states so @xmath111 .",
    "however for an atom interferometer made with a single laser driving a transition directly between two atomic states , the @xmath24 terms would be gone and the terms proportional to @xmath101 would be the leading order phase shift . in this case , @xmath101 would be the same size as the @xmath96 of the laser in order to make the atomic transition possible .",

    "of course , as we see from eqn .",
    "this increase stops when the size and time of the interferometer become comparable to the wavelength and period , @xmath116 , of the gravitational wave .",
    "note that in the intermediate regime where @xmath117 then we can expand in @xmath69 times the distances so @xmath118 when @xmath119 , this is very similar to the phase shift in ligo which goes as @xmath120 .",
    "although we will not go through the details of the whole calculation here , we will motivate the origin of the main effect , @xmath121 .",

    ". we will be interested in the case where the length of the atom s paths are small compared to the distance between the lasers , @xmath123 so the interferometer essentially takes place entirely at position @xmath99 .",
    "the main effect comes from laser phase from the passive laser , hence from the timing of these laser pulses .",
    "the control laser s pulses are always at @xmath124 , @xmath27 , and @xmath125 . as an example , the first beamsplitter pulse from the control laser then would reach the atom at time @xmath99 in flat space and so the passive laser pulse then originates at @xmath126 .",
    "however if the gravitational wave is causing an expansion of space the control pulse is ` delayed ' and actually reaches the atom at time @xmath127 .",
    "then the passive laser pulse originated at @xmath128 .",
    "thus the laser phase from the passive laser pulse has been changed by the gravitational wave by an amount @xmath129 .",
    "this is our signal .",
    "although this motivation is coordinate dependent , it provides intuition for the result of the full gauge invariant calculation .",
    "eqn . is the main effect of a gravitational wave in an atom interferometer .",
    "therefore , the signal we are searching for is a phase shift in the interferometer that oscillates in time with the frequency of the gravitational wave .",
    "note that eqn . and all terms in table [ tab : phases ] are oscillatory because @xmath71 , the phase of the gravitational wave at the time the atom interferometer begins ( the time of the first beamsplitter pulse ) , oscillates in time . in other words , the phase shift measured by the atom interferometer changes from shot to shot because the phase of the gravitational wave changes .",
    "one way to enhance this signal is to use large momentum transfer ( lmt ) beamsplitters as described in section [ sec : ai ] .",
    "this can be thought of as giving a large number of photon kicks to the atom , transferring momentum @xmath130 .",
    "this enhances the signal by a factor of @xmath131 since laser phase is enhanced by @xmath131 .",
    "the phase shift calculation is then exactly as if @xmath96 of the laser is replaced by @xmath132 .    as usual for a gravitational wave detector",
    ", this answer would be modulated by the angle between the direction of propagation of the gravitational wave and the orientation of the detector .",
    "if the gravitational wave is propagating in the same direction as the lasers in the interferometer there will be no signal ( for the results above we assumed a gravitational wave propagating perpendicularly to the laser axis ) .",
    "this is clear since a gravitational wave is transverse , so space is not stretched in the direction of propagation .",
    "we have shown that there is an oscillatory gravitational wave signal in an atom interferometer . to determine whether this signal is detectable requires examining the backgrounds in a possible experiment .",
    "two of the most important backgrounds are vibrations and laser phase noise .",
    "as experience with ligo would suggest , vibrational noise can be orders of magnitude larger than a gravitational wave signal . for an atom interferometer , laser phase noise can also directly affect the measurement and can be larger than the signal . reducing these backgrounds",
    "must therefore dictate the experimental configuration .",
    "after the atom clouds are launched , they are inertial and do not feel vibrations .",
    "the vibrations they feel while in the atomic trap do not directly affect the final measured phase shift because the first beamsplitter pulse has not been applied yet .",
    "both vibrational and laser phase noise arise only from the lasers which run the atom interferometer .",
    "we propose a differential measurement between two simultaneous atom interferometers run with the same laser pulses to greatly reduce these backgrounds . in order to maximize a gravitational wave signal ,",
    "these atom interferometers should be separated by a distance @xmath78 which is as large as experimentally achievable .    on the earth ,",
    "one possible experimental configuration is to have a long , vertical shaft with one interferometer near the top and the other near the bottom of the shaft .",
    "the atom interferometers would be run vertically along the axis defined by the common laser pulses applied from the bottom and top of the shaft , as shown in fig .",

    "we will consider a @xmath133 long shaft , with two @xmath134 long atom interferometers @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",

    "because the two atom interferometers are separated by a distance @xmath78 , the gravitational wave signal in each will not have the same magnitude but will differ by @xmath139 as shown in the previous section .",
    "such a differential measurement can reduce backgrounds without reducing the signal .",
    "+    one reason to use only 10 m at the top and bottom of the shaft for the atom interferometers themselves is to reduce the cost scaling with length .",
    "there are more stringent requirements on the interferometer regions than on the region between them .",
    "the interferometer regions should have a constant bias magnetic field applied vertically in order to fix the atomic spins to the vertical axis .",
    "this bias field must be larger than any ambient magnetic field , and this , along with the desire to reduce phase shifts from this ambient field ( as will be seen later ) , requires magnetically shielding the interferometer regions .",
    "further , the regions must be in ultra - high vacuum @xmath140 in order to avoid destroying the cold atom cloud . at this pressure and room temperature",

    "the success of this measurement strategy requires the optical path length in the region between the interferometers to be stable in the measurement band . in order to detect a gravitational wave of strain @xmath146 ( see section [ sec : sensitivities ] ) , time variations in the index of refraction @xmath147 of the region between the interferometers , in the 1 hz band , must be smaller than @xmath148 .",

    "it is possible to obtain a sufficiently rapid rabi oscillation frequency using a @xmath163 laser with a rayleigh range @xmath164 which is easy to achieve with a waist of @xmath165 .",
    "this will be a more restrictive requirement for the satellite based experiment and so will be considered in greater detail in section [ sec : space baseline limit ] .",

    "we will show that it is possible to have multiple atom clouds running concurrent atom interferometers in each of the two interferometer regions .",
    "this is possible because the atom clouds are dilute and so pass through each other and also because it is possible for the beamsplitter and mirror laser pulses to interact only with a particular atom cloud even though all the atom clouds are along the laser propagation axis .",
    "this is accomplished by doppler detuning the required laser frequencies of each atomic transition by having all the atom clouds moving with different velocities at any instant of time .",
    "we imagine having different clouds shot sequentially with the same launch position and velocity , with a time difference @xmath170 ( see figure [ fig : many shots ] ) .",
    "the atom clouds accelerate under gravity and so each successive atom cloud always has a velocity difference from the preceding one of @xmath171 .",
    "when a beamsplitter or mirror pulse is applied along the axis , it must be tuned to the doppler shifted atomic transition frequency .",
    "the width of the two - photon transitions that make the beamsplitters and mirrors is set by the rabi frequency and so can be roughly @xmath172 . taking a laser frequency of @xmath173",
    "implies that the clouds must have velocities that differ by at least @xmath174 in order for the doppler shift to be larger than the width of the transition . in practice",
    ", every cloud besides the one being acted upon should be many line - widths away from resonance which can be accomplished if @xmath175 .",
    "while doppler detuning prevents unwanted stimulated transitions , the laser field can drive spontaneous 2-photon transitions as discussed in subsection [ sec : space baseline limit ] .",

    "there is a tradeoff between the rate of cooling and the number of atoms in the cloud .",
    "here we only assume that cooling can be done at this rate , if necessary with several different atomic traps , since this rate is not drastically higher than presently achievable rates . in order to detect a gravitational wave",

    "in particular , time varying differential acceleration backgrounds must be smaller than the target acceleration sensitivity @xmath196 .",
    "in addition to stochastic noise , there might be backgrounds with long coherence times in a given detector .",
    "since these backgrounds will not efficiently integrate down , the sensitivity of any single detector will be limited by the floor set by these backgrounds . however , as discussed in sub section [ sec : earth setup ] , it may be desirable to build and simultaneously operate a network of several such gravitational wave detectors .",
    "the gravitational wave signal in a given detector depends upon the orientation of the detector relative to the incident direction , the polarization and the arrival time of the gravitational wave at the detector . if the detectors are sufficiently far away , then the gravitational wave signal in the detectors are in a well defined relationship which is different from the contribution of backgrounds with long coherence time .",

    "the phase shift in the interferometer is accrued by the atom during the time between the initial and final beamsplitters . in this period , the atoms are in free fall and are coupled to ambient vibrations only through gravity .",
    "in addition to this coupling , vibrations of the trap used to confine the atoms before their launch will lead to fluctuations in the launch velocity of the atom cloud .",
    "these fluctuations do not directly cause a phase shift since the initial beamsplitter is applied to the atoms after their launch .",

    "however , the diffuse atom cloud trajectories that form the arms of the interferometer need not be inside the satellite .",
    "collisions of the atoms with background gas ( _ e.g. _ solar wind ) and photons are the major problem posed by the environment to the atom interferometer .",
    "these collisions cause decoherence and atoms that undergo such interactions can not engage in quantum interference .",
    "collisions are therefore not a source of noise since they do not cause phase shifts . however , by knocking atoms away from the atom cloud , collisions reduce the number of atoms available to do the experiment , thereby decreasing the sensitivity of the instrument .",
    "solar photons are a source of decoherence .",
    "the interaction cross section of the photon with the atom is appreciable only if the frequency of the photon is within the width of an atomic transition .",
    "for example , for rubidium the most important transition in this band is the 780 nm line with a width of a few mhz . at a distance of 1 au , the solar spectral intensity around 780 nm is @xmath421 .",

    "the resonant photon - atom scattering cross section is @xmath424 . the mean photon scattering rate for an atom in the sun s light is then @xmath425 .",
    "this is a severe limit on the possible interrogation time for the atom interferometer and so must be avoided .",
    "there are several possible solutions .",
    "satellite experiments like the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) mission rely on the use of large @xmath426 ultra - light sunshields ( @xmath427 ) to protect the satellite from solar radiation .",
    "these shields can reduce the solar intensity from @xmath428 to @xmath429 @xcite .",
    "the decoherence time scale due to the residual solar flux is @xmath430 which is significantly longer than the time scales of interest to this experiment . in this case",
    "the size of the shield would be one limit on the size of the atom path .",
    "another possibility is to place the satellites in a lunar or geocentric orbit .",
    "if the experiment is done in such an orbit , then the satellites will spend an order one fraction of the time on the dark side of the moon / earth where there is no problem ( a similar estimate for a 300 k blackbody spectrum gives a very low scattering rate ) .",
    "this leads to an order one loss of duty cycle and a small loss of statistical sensitivity . it might also be possible to perform the experiment farther from the sun to reduce the solar intensity , though this would presumably increase the difficulty and expense while still limiting interrogation times",
    "the environment outside the satellite is dominated by the solar wind composed of protons and electrons with a number density @xmath431 moving at velocities @xmath432 .",
    "the typical interaction cross - section of these particles with the atom is @xmath433 leading to mean collision times @xmath434 .",
    "the local environment near the spacecraft is less pristine than the space vacuum due to emissions from the spacecraft . in order to make use of the local space environment to run the interferometer",
    ", the craft must be designed so that such emissions are not in the direction of the atom trajectories .",
    "the atom will be subjected to the interplanetary magnetic field if the experiment is done outside the spacecraft . in order to suppress phase shifts from magnetic fields ,",
    "the atom must be placed in a magnetically insensitive @xmath435 state in the direction set by the field .",
    "the rabi frequency of the atomic transition is set by the internal state of the atom and the laser must be tuned to match this frequency . since , in the random interplanetary magnetic field , the atom s spin precesses rapidly , the spin of the atom will change as the direction of the magnetic field changes . if the direction of the magnetic field changes over the length of the interferometer , the atom will evolve away from the original @xmath435 state .",

    "the interaction between the laser and the atom will excite , for example , @xmath436 states along the new axis of quantization .",
    "pollution into these states will cause phase shifts that are a background to the experiment .",
    "the interplanetary planetary magnetic field at 1 au is @xmath420 5 nt and has a correlation length @xmath420 0.01 au .",
    "the drift in the direction of the field is smaller than @xmath437 over 10 minutes during an average time interval but can be as large as @xmath438 over 10 minutes during noisier times @xcite .",

    "in addition to this slow drift , the magnetic field also exhibits sharp discontinuities in its direction .",
    "these sharp directional discontinuities are separated by periods of an hour @xcite and are not a problem to an interferometer with interrogation time smaller than 100 s. the direction of the magnetic field in the interferometer region can be further stabilized by attaching a permanent magnet to the spacecraft , coaxial to the atomic trajectory . a bar magnet of size @xmath439 with magnetization @xmath440",

    "the torque on the spacecraft from the action of the interplanetary magnetic field on the external magnet is @xmath443 nm , which is of the same order of magnitude as the torque produced by solar pressure on the satellite .",
    "since the forces on the spacecraft due to the external magnet are comparable to the force from solar pressure , the addition of the magnet will not significantly alter the dynamics of the spacecraft control system . with the addition of the bias field from the permanent magnet",

    "these arguments suggest that it should be possible to run the interferometer outside the spacecraft to distances @xmath278 m.      the detection of a time varying signal from a gravitational wave of frequency @xmath388 requires a data taking rate @xmath389 . as discussed in sub section [ sec : earth setup ] , this requires the operation of concurrent atom interferometers along the common satellite axis .",

    "the response of the atom interferometer to a given electromagnetic field is determined by known quantities like the magnetic moment of the atom and its polarizability .",

    "temperature variations of the satellite at frequency @xmath69 have to be larger than @xmath583 in order to change the temperature of the interferometer region by @xmath584 k. the spacecraft receives heat from the sun and the solar wind . as discussed above , variations in the solar output are small over the time scale of interest .",
    "the solar wind is composed of 2 kev protons and electrons with density @xmath585 moving at speeds @xmath586 .",
    "the change in temperature of the satellite from an order one change in the flux of the solar wind is @xmath587 .",
    "the environment of the satellite will therefore not cause its temperature to fluctuate at levels of interest to this experiment .    the satellite will also establish a spatial thermal gradient over the interferometer region due to its shadow .",
    "this spatial gradient will contribute to the phase shift in the interferometer .",
    "the natural time scale for the variation of this phase shift is equal to the orbital period of the satellite @xmath154 year and is therefore not a problem for the current experiment .",
    "time variations of this spatial gradient are also created by random motions of the satellite during the interrogation time of the experiment . however , these motions need to be well controlled to suppress newtonian gravity backgrounds which are much larger than the small phase shift produced by the spatial thermal gradient",

    ", the effects of laser phase noise are cancelled up to knowledge of the arm lengths ( see subsection [ subsec : spacevibrations ] ) .",
    "both lisa and the atom interferometer can benefit by exploiting this idea .",
    "however , due its long ( @xmath187 million km ) arm length , lisa faces unique challenges in determining the absolute distance between its satellites @xcite . owing to these difficulties",
    ", lisa requires control over the frequency drift of its lasers at @xmath591 at @xmath564 .",

    "there are many known and potential sources for gravitational waves from astrophysics and cosmology . here we will discuss only a few , including the well - known compact object binaries , which give a coherent oscillatory gravitational wave signal , and more speculative cosmological sources , which give a stochastic background of gravitational waves .",
    "there are many reviews of this subject that discuss other sources including gamma - ray bursts , supernovae , and spinning neutron stars ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most promising sources of observable gravitational waves is a binary star where both components are compact objects such as white dwarfs , neutron stars , or black holes @xcite .",
    "these compact binaries emit strongly in gravitational waves because they contain large mass stars relatively close to each other .",
    "the amplitude of the gravitational waves emitted is @xmath594 where @xmath595 are the masses of the components , @xmath596 and @xmath597 are the total and reduced masses , @xmath176 is the radius of the binary , @xmath598 is the orbital frequency of the binary , and @xmath599 is the distance from the binary at which the wave is observed . as",
    "neutron stars and white dwarfs are both roughly 1 solar mass , @xmath600 , we will primarily be interested in compact binaries composed of two @xmath601 mass components as sources .",
    "the amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves then depends only on the orbital period and the distance to the star . for a binary with @xmath602 in our galaxy",
    "we expect @xmath74 , in our local cluster @xmath603 , and in a hubble volume ( i.e. out to redshifts @xmath604 ) @xmath479 .",
    "the main frequency component of the emitted gravitational wave is at twice the binary s orbital frequency , @xmath605 @xcite .",
    "this is clear for equal mass stars , and can also be seen for unequal masses from the fact that gravitational radiation arises from the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment of the binary .",
    "near the end of its life , the dominant energy loss mechanism for a compact binary is gravitational radiation . as a compact binary loses energy , the stars spiral inward , increasing the orbital frequency .",
    "this can bring the emitted gravitational waves into the observable part of the spectrum for gravitational wave detectors .",
    "this process ends when the two compact objects collide .",
    "thus , the highest gravitational wave frequency emitted depends on the radii of the compact objects .",
    "a neutron star binary can reach frequencies of over 100 hz while a white dwarf binary can only reach roughly 0.5 hz before collision .",
    "the power emitted in gravitational waves is @xmath606 . because this power depends mainly on a few variables like the masses and orbital period of the binary , the inspiral of a compact binary near the end of its life is consistent and predictable and",
    "therefore so is the waveform of the emitted gravitational waves .",
    "using the power emitted in gravitational waves , the remaining lifetime of a compact binary is @xcite @xmath607 as the orbital frequency increases , the rate of energy loss increases and the remaining lifetime decreases rapidly .",
    "this means that at any given @xmath598 most of the remaining life of the binary will occur near that frequency .",
    "there are thus two main advantages to being able to observe gravitational waves at lower frequencies .",
    "first , the population of binary stars that are potentially observable is increased , both because new classes of stars such as white dwarf or high - mass black hole binaries are observable and because a greater fraction of any given class , such as neutron star binaries , is at lower frequencies than at higher ones . indeed , for a gravitational wave detector such as lisa which can observe waves with frequencies as low as @xmath608 , the large number of white dwarf binaries creates a stochastic background of gravitational waves for the detector in this frequency band @xcite .",
    "second , a lower frequency binary has a longer time left to live which increases the observation time and thus the sensitivity of the detector for this source .",
    "in addition to a large number of white dwarf binaries , several potential cosmological sources can produce a stochastic background of gravitational waves including inflation and reheating , a network of cosmic strings , or phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "a period of inflation can produce a fairly flat ( scale - invariant ) stochastic gravitational wave background @xcite",
    ". this could be as high as @xmath609 , as limited by the cobe bound @xcite , though slow - roll inflation models probably give a smaller value and a tilted spectrum @xcite .",
    "this is fairly difficult for planned experiments to detect , but reheating after inflation can give a more peaked spectrum of gravitational waves with a higher value of @xmath10 .",
    "for example , reheating after hybrid inflation @xcite or preheating @xcite , can give a spectrum of gravitational waves with @xmath10 several orders of magnitude higher than that from the period of inflation itself .",
    "the frequency of the peak is model - dependent , proportional to the scale of reheating .",
    "it probably lies within a range from roughly @xmath138 to @xmath610 .",
    "there is then a possibility that this enhanced strength of gravitational waves from reheating will allow a detection by interferometers .",
    "there are also other possibilities such as pre - big bang @xcite or extended @xcite inflation that can lead to much higher values of @xmath611 in the phenomenologically interesting frequency range for interferometers .",
    "a first - order phase transition in the early universe can produce gravitational waves through bubble nucleation and turbulence @xcite .",
    "the frequency of the gravitational waves today is given by redshifting the frequency at which they were produced , which is proportional to the hubble scale at the phase transition .",
    "there are , however , significant uncertainties in the calculations of these frequencies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the best expectation is that a phase transition at the electroweak scale is likely to produce gravitational waves with a frequency today in a range near @xmath608 .",
    "earlier phase transitions at higher temperatures produce gravitational waves with proportionally higher frequencies . in some models with new physics at the weak scale @xcite , including some supersymmetric @xcite and warped extra - dimensional @xcite models , the electroweak phase transition can produce gravitational waves with very large @xmath10 , well above the threshold for detection by atom interferometers .",
    "a network of cosmic strings produces a stochastic background of gravitational waves from vibrations of the strings .",
    "cusps and kinks in the strings produce bursts of gravitational waves which could be seen individually or as a stochastic background . unfortunately ,",
    "even in the simplest models there are large uncertainties in the calculation of the formation and subsequent gravitational radiation of such string networks .",
    "thus , it is very difficult to get a precise prediction from theory about the strength of gravitational waves coming from a network of cosmic strings . using the current understanding of cosmic string networks , the sensitivities of atom interferometers on earth and in space to a stochastic gravitational wave background ( see figs . [",
    "fig : earth stochastic sensitivity ] and [ fig : space stochastic sensitivity ] ) could allow detection of cosmic strings with @xmath612 to @xmath613 ( @xmath614 is the string tension ) or lower , depending on the sensitivity achieved and the uncertainties in the cosmic string calculations .",
    "for a recent review of this subject see for example @xcite .",
    "there are many other possible sources for gravitational waves from fundamental physics in the early universe including goldstone modes of scalar fields @xcite , or radion modes and fluctuations of our brane in an extra dimensional scenario @xcite .",
    "there are also other astrophysical sources that may lead to an interesting stochastic gravitational wave background ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility of accessing these cosmological and astrophysical sources makes gravitational waves a very interesting avenue for exploring the universe and probing fundamental physics .",
    "indeed , observing gravitational waves could be one of our only ways of getting information about the universe before the last scattering surface .",
    "in this section we find projected sensitivity curves for the terrestrial and satellite experiments .",
    "there is always significant uncertainty in projecting the sensitivity of a proposed experiment .",
    "we have attempted to give a range of sensitivities to show more conservative and more aggressive assumptions about what may be experimentally achievable .",
    "there is also some uncertainty in these sensitivity curves because we have not attempted to perform a careful statistical study of the exact sensitivity for a particular configuration . especially in the case of the stochastic gravitational wave background , this can make important differences that have been worked out carefully be many authors for laser interferometers .",
    "we leave such considerations to future work .",

    "the inherent limit on the sensitivity to a gravitational wave due to shot noise can be found from eqn . .",
    "this limit , equivalently the power spectrum of the shot noise in the experiment @xmath619 , is shown in figure [ fig : demon binary sensitivity ] for an example configuration , as described in sections [ sec : space setup ] or [ sec : earth setup ] .",
    "here we have taken the two atom interferometers to be a distance @xmath223 apart , with interrogation time @xmath615 , @xmath616 lmt beamsplitters , and a per shot phase sensitivity of @xmath620 .",
    "we have also assumed a data - taking rate of @xmath618 .",
    "the plot is cutoff at the nyquist frequency of @xmath621 .",
    "there would in actuality be some sensitivity to higher frequencies but they will be aliased to look like lower frequencies potentially also leading to confusion with backgrounds .    at low frequencies the sensitivity rises as @xmath622 as is clear from eqn . .",
    "for higher frequencies , the sensitivity flattens out because a longer interrogation time does not increase the response of the interferometer once it is longer than the period of the gravitational wave @xmath623 .",
    "the sensitivity then reaches it s maximum when @xmath624 , i.e. when there are an odd number of periods of the gravitational wave in the entire time @xmath28 of the interferometer .",
    "this agrees with the intuition that the interferometer is sensitive to changes in the relative timing of the laser pulses caused by the stretching of the metric and therefore maximally sensitive when there is the greatest change in the distance to the laser ( the clock ) between each successive laser pulse .",
    "the singularities in the sensitivity curve in figure [ fig : demon binary sensitivity ] come at frequencies which are integral multiples of @xmath625 , when an integral number of periods of the gravitational wave fit in the interrogation time @xmath27 .",
    "roughly the periods when the gravitational wave is causing a ` stretch ' exactly equal the periods when it is causing a ` squeeze '",
    ". the net integrated effect of the gravitational wave is then zero and the phase shift response of the atom interferometer goes to zero .",
    "thus the atom interferometer has no sensitivity to such frequencies .",
    "note that the best sensitivities in figure [ fig : demon binary sensitivity ] come at frequencies halfway between the singularities , when there are an odd , integral number of periods of the gravitational wave in the entire atom interferometer ( a time of @xmath28 ) .",
    "this can be understood since the atom interferometer is essentially taking the difference between the phases accrued by the atom in the first and second halves of the sequence .",
    "the maximal difference arises when the ` stretch ' part of the gravitational wave ( which is when the coefficient of the @xmath626 term in eqn is greater than 1 ) occurs during one of the halves and the ` squeeze ' during the other .",
    "these are the frequencies to which the atom interferometer responds maximally .    a longer interrogation time for the experiment",
    "does not actually improve the peak sensitivity in the sense of lowering the curve in figure [ fig : demon binary sensitivity ] .",
    "instead , it slides the curve left , lowering the frequency at which the maximum sensitivity is reached .",
    "of course , a larger length @xmath78 or higher momentum beamsplitters improves the entire sensitivity curve linearly .",
    "we have cut off the sensitivity curve above the nyquist frequency . in reality",
    "there will be a slightly more gradual loss of sensitivity before this frequency and even some sensitivity to higher frequencies , although they will be aliased .",
    "assuming a constant number of atoms per second that can be cooled and run through the interferometer , a faster data - taking rate does not improve sensitivity .",
    "it would merely improve the high frequency cutoff .",
    "thus it seems unnecessary to strive for a data - taking rate faster than @xmath627 .",
    "the sensitivity would also decrease as the frequency of the gravitational wave approached the light travel time ( or really the gravitational wave travel time ) across the whole experiment , namely @xmath78 .",
    "however this frequency is much higher than the frequency of maximal sensitivity for an atom interferometer .",
    "this would not be true for a light interferometer where the light travel time across the device is also the time length of a ` shot ' , the analogue of the interrogation time .",

    "these curves follow from the standard analysis , so we plot the @xmath641 confidence limit on the spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves . following @xcite ( but see also @xcite ) we estimate this limit by @xmath642 where @xmath643 is the total time length of the experiment , @xmath644 is a geometric factor taking into account the positions of the two detectors which we take equal to its maximum value @xmath645 ( it will probably be slightly smaller in a real configuration ) , and @xmath646 is the power spectrum of the noise in the gravitational wave detector as plotted for example in figure [ fig : demon binary sensitivity ] . to produce the curves in figures [ fig : earth stochastic sensitivity ] and [ fig : space stochastic sensitivity ] we use the @xmath646 from figures [ fig : earth binary sensitivity ] and [ fig : space binary sensitivity ] , respectively . as is standard , we assume a @xmath647 integration time for the experiment .",
    "this is only a benefit if two detectors can be cross - correlated . otherwise , the sensitivity to a stochastic background is no better than the noise on each shot and it is only possible to place limits on and not to detect such a background .",
    "it is advantageous to measure at lower frequencies to gain sensitivity in the variable @xmath10 because it scales favorably with low @xmath388 .",
    "further , there is a cutoff in @xmath644 and thus the sensitivity when the two gravitational wave detectors are father apart than the wavelength of the gravitational waves , @xmath648 . for frequencies below @xmath627",
    "this is not a problem for our detectors , but for ligo this is an issue . the sensitivity of ligo to stochastic gravitational waves is reduced because of the large distance between their two detectors , @xmath649 @xcite .",
    "there is predicted to be a stochastic background of gravitational waves from the large number of galactic and extragalactic close binaries , mainly white dwarf binaries .",
    "there are significant uncertainties in the calculation of the spectrum from this source due to uncertainty in stellar population models .",
    "figures [ fig : earth stochastic sensitivity ] and [ fig : space stochastic sensitivity ] show one prediction @xcite for this background with the approximate uncertainty represented by the size of the band .",
    "this background is reduced to some extent by the ability to measure and subtract known binary sources .",
    "it can limit the ability of gravitational wave detectors to see other , cosmological sources of gravitational waves in this low frequency band .",
    "( color online ) the same plot as in figures [ fig : earth stochastic sensitivity ] , [ fig : space stochastic sensitivity ] with possible new physics sources of stochastic gravitational waves .",
    "the ( green ) curve labeled rs1 corresponds to an example spectrum of gravity waves from a tev scale phase transition , in this case in rs1 @xcite .",
    "the ( orange ) lines labeled with @xmath650 correspond to one prediction for a network of cosmic strings with tensions @xmath651 and @xmath652 ( with @xmath653 and @xmath654 ) @xcite . note that these cosmic string estimates have large uncertainties and may be optimistic assumptions . ]",
    "figure [ fig : space stochastic sources ] shows several possible new physics sources of gravitational waves . an example spectrum from the tev scale phase transition in rs1 taken from @xcite",
    "is shown to illustrate roughly what the spectrum from an electroweak scale phase transition might look like .",
    "it shows a peak at frequencies around @xmath569 hz and can certainly be strong enough to be visible in these interferometric detectors .",
    "of course there is much model dependence in this spectrum ; for example , only a first order weak scale phase transition will produce gravitational waves at all .",
    "two example spectra are shown for cosmic strings with tensions @xmath651 and @xmath652 from @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that not only is there model dependence in the spectrum from cosmic strings , but there is also much uncertainty in the calculation and so these should probably be considered to be upper limits on the spectrum of gravitational waves from such cosmic string networks .",
    "however , given these optimistic assumptions , it may be possible to detect a network of cosmic strings with tension as low as @xmath655 using these interferometers .",
    "this is becoming limited by the white dwarf background , whose calculation itself has large uncertainties .",
    "the region labeled ` inflation ' in the figure is really the upper limit on the possible inflation spectrum assuming it is perfectly flat from the low frequency cmb bound . however , realistic models of inflation give @xmath656 in our frequency band with the highest values of @xmath598 from the highest scale models of inflation .",
    "low scale inflation models will not directly give observable gravitational wave spectra , but could give observable gravitational waves from reheating ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "previous studies on the role of atom interferometers in gravitational wave detection concluded that they would be of limited use in probing the gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "our proposal differs significantly from these efforts owing to the central role played by light pulse interferometry in our setup .",
    "the work of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite used material mirrors like diffraction gratings to execute the interferometer .",
    "the gravitational wave signal in the configurations considered in these papers is @xmath657 where @xmath96 is the momentum of the atom , @xmath70 the amplitude of the gravitational wave and @xmath383 the distance between the mirrors .",
    "it is experimentally difficult to make the distance between these mirrors bigger than @xmath154 m. even if the distance between the mirrors were to be increased , the experiment would still be difficult since the separation between the two arms of the atom s wave function must also be equally scaled .",
    "these considerations forced the authors to conclude that an unrealistic atom flux would be needed to see a gravitational wave .",
    "the use of material mirrors suffers from the additional drawback that the mirrors would be subject to vibration noise .",
    "the mirrors would have to be placed on vibration isolation stacks so this interferometer would be subject to the same limitations as light based interferometers like ligo .",
    "the work of @xcite and @xcite described atom interferometers which used light pulse interferometry .",
    "however , these authors did not consider the effect of the gravitational wave on the light pulses used to execute the interferometry . without this effect ,",
    "the phase shift in the interferometer is @xmath657 where @xmath383 is the separation between the two arms of the interferometer ( see discussion in section [ sec : signal results ] ) .",
    "since the separation between the two arms of the interferometer can not be easily scaled , these authors were also forced to consider unrealistic atom fluxes . moreover",
    ", these papers did not discuss strategies to handle crucial backgrounds to gravitational wave detection like vibration and laser phase noise .    in this paper ,",
    "we point out that the effect of the gravitational wave on the light pulses used to execute the interferometer is crucial and can be easily scaled to increase the signal .",
    "when the interferometer is operated by a laser at a distance @xmath78 , a gravitational wave of amplitude @xmath70 causes a phase shift @xmath658 .",
    "this signal increases as long as @xmath78 is smaller than the wavelength of the gravitational wave . unlike the separation between the two arms of the atom s wave function",
    ", the distance between the atom and the laser can be easily scaled . with @xmath659 km ,",
    "the signal in this interferometer is @xmath516 larger than the signal in the configurations previously considered .",
    "in addition to boosting the signal , the configuration considered in this paper offers an effective way to deal with vibration and laser phase noise . by using the same laser to run two widely separated interferometers and measuring the differential phase shift between the two interferometers , this setup",
    "drastically suppresses the effects of vibrations and laser phase noise .",
    "our setup thus achieves a large , scaleable enhancement in the signal while simultaneously suppressing backgrounds thereby making it possible to search for gravitational waves with current technology .",
    "the sagas @xcite project that uses atom interferometry and ion clock techniques to explore gravity in the outer solar system was proposed .",
    "sagas will improve current bounds on stochastic gravitational waves in the frequency band @xmath660 but is not expected to be sensitive to known sources of gravitational radiation . in contrast , our proposal will search for gravitational waves in the @xmath661 band at sensitivities that can detect gravitational waves from expected sources .",
    "we have proposed two experiments , terrestrial and satellite - based , to observe gravitational waves using atom interferometry .",
    "both experiments rely on similar underlying ideas to achieve a large , scaleable enhancement to the gravitational wave signal while naturally suppressing many backgrounds .",
    "a differential measurement is performed between two atom interferometers run simultaneously using the same laser pulses .",
    "the lasers provide a common ` ruler ' for comparison of the two interferometers .",
    "the distance between the interferometers can be large because only the light travels over this distance , not the atoms .",
    "the signal still scales with this distance and so can be competitive with light interferometers . in a sense ,",
    "the atom interferometers are the analogue of the mirrors in a light interferometer and it is the distance between them that determines the size of the signal .",
    "further , many backgrounds are naturally suppressed by this method . laser phase noise , which must be cancelled between the two arms of a light interferometer , is here cancelled by the differential measurement between the two atom interferometers . since this subtraction is between two interferometers along the same laser axis with only vacuum in between , vibrations of the lasers ( and any optics )",
    "are cancelled as well .",
    "the atoms themselves , the analogues of the mirrors in a light interferometer , are in free fall and are unaffected by vibrations .",
    "this removes one of the major backgrounds which prohibits terrestrial light interferometers from achieving sensitivity to lower frequencies .",
    "for example , advanced ligo will lose sensitivity below @xmath242 hz due to direct ( non - gravitational ) coupling to vibrations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , in the satellite - based experiment the atoms can be far from the satellite , greatly reducing the engineering requirements on the control of the satellites .",
    "satellite position control and laser noise are two of the major hurdles for an experiment such as lisa . for similar gravitational wave sensitivity ,",
    "these requirements are significantly reduced for our atom interferometer proposal .",
    "of course , new backgrounds may enter in an atomic experiment .",
    "we have attempted to consider all the relevant backgrounds and show that they are controllable with practical technology in a realistic setup .",
    "many backgrounds will require careful engineering , just as for any gravitational wave detector .",
    "we are certainly not experts in every relevant area of expertise necessary for such experiments , but this experiment seems possible and exciting enough to merit more serious consideration .",
    "an interesting consequence of having a differential measurement between two interferometers along the same baseline is that this setup would have sensitivity to scalar - type perturbations , that would , for example , change the length of the perimeter of the lisa triangle .",
    "ligo lacks sensitivity to these signals since two perpendicular laser arms are used to remove backgrounds including laser phase noise .",
    "our setup confers sensitivity to overall changes in the length of a single arm since each arm is a laser phase noise free combination . in lisa these sagnac channel events would be vetoed .",
    "one interesting signal of this type would arise from large mass dark matter particles passing near the detector @xcite .",
    "there are many avenues for improvement of these proposals in the future .",
    "the atom statistics may be improved with improved cooling techniques , ultimately limited only by the limit on the density of the cloud from atom - atom interactions and on the total number of atoms from opacity of the cloud .",
    "the use of squeezed atom states may also allow significant improvements in atom statistics beyond the standard quantum limit .",
    "improved sensitivities could also come from better classical and atom optics including multi - photon lmt beamsplitters , higher laser powers and larger laser waist sizes .",
    "there may also be clever ideas for improved atomic systems , for example which suppress the spontaneous 2-photon transition rate without suppressing the stimulated rate .",
    "it is difficult to predict what advances will be made in the future .",
    "nevertheless , the rapid advance of atom interferometry motivates us to consider a range of sensitivity curves that illustrate the possibilities not just for current but also near future technology .",
    "the proposed gravitational wave detectors may allow the observation of low frequency sources in the band @xmath662 .",
    "this is a very exciting range for astrophysical and cosmological sources .",
    "compact binaries including black holes , neutron stars , and white dwarfs live for a long period in this band .",
    "such low frequencies also allow enhanced sensitivity to a stochastic background of gravitational waves , assuming at least two such agis detectors are built .",
    "many cosmological sources arising from physics beyond the standard model could be present in this range including inflation and reheating , early universe phase transitions , or cosmic strings .",
    "the observation of gravitational waves has the potential to reveal significant information about new physics at both the shortest and longest length scales .",
