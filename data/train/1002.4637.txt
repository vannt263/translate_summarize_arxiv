    "we describe somewhat surprising properties of the entanglement measures for two - qubits in _",
    "mixed _ states . for brevity , by referring to the entanglement measures , we also mean the nonlocality @xmath28 .",
    "the problem can be posed as follows :    two measures of entanglement , say @xmath36 and @xmath37 , imply the same ordering of states if the condition  @xcite [ p1 ] @xmath38 is satisfied for arbitrary states @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the question is whether this condition is fulfilled for all `` good '' entanglement measures .    in early fundamental works on quantum information",
    ", it is often claimed that good entanglement measures should fulfill this condition .",
    "for example , in ref .  @xcite it was stated that : `` for consistency , it is only important that if @xmath39 is more entangled then @xmath40 for one measure than it also must be for all other measures . ''    for qubits in pure states ,",
    "condition  ( [ n36 ] ) is always fulfilled , since all good measures are equivalent .",
    "however , standard measures can imply different ordering of mixed states even for only two qubits .",
    "this was first shown numerically by eisert and plenio  @xcite by analyzing their results of monte carlo simulations of two - qubit states .",
    "the problem was then analyzed by others  @xcite .    to our knowledge",

    "note that the violation of condition  ( [ n36 ] ) can not be observed for pure states of two - qubit systems . by contrast , for three - level systems ( the so - called qutrits ) , analytical examples of violation of the condition are known even for pure states  @xcite .",
    "the property that ordering of states depends on the applied entanglement measure sounds counterintuitive .",
    "nevertheless , it is physically sound , since states , which are differently ordered according to two measures , can not be transformed into each other with 100% efficiency by applying local quantum operations and classical communication ( locc ) only .",
    "virmani and plenio  @xcite proved in general terms that all good asymptotic entanglement measures are either identical or have to imply a different ordering on some quantum states .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the three measures ( the negativity , concurrence , and the ree ) were compared and found analytical examples of states ( say @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) for which one measure implies state ordering opposite to that implied by the other two measures : @xmath43 there can be found other analytical examples of states exhibiting even more peculiar ordering of states according to these three measures .",
    "examples include pairs of states for which a degree of entanglement is preserved according to one or two measures but it is different according to the other measures , e.g. : @xmath44 and @xmath45    the comparative analyses presented in refs .",
    "@xcite are not only related to a mathematical problem of classification of states according to various entanglement measures .",

    "<S> we review some counterintuitive properties of standard measures describing quantum entanglement and violation of bell s inequality ( often referred to as `` nonlocality '' ) in two - qubit systems . by comparing the nonlocality , negativity , concurrence , and relative entropy of entanglement </S>",
    "<S> , we show : ( i ) ambiguity in ordering states with the entanglement measures , </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) ambiguity of robustness of entanglement in lossy systems and ( iii ) existence of two - qubit mixed states more entangled than pure states having the same negativity or nonlocality . to support our conclusions , we performed a monte carlo simulation of @xmath0 two - qubit states and calculated all the entanglement measures for them . </S>",
    "<S> our demonstration of the relativity of entanglement measures implies also how desirable is to properly use an operationally - defined entanglement measure rather than to apply formally - defined standard measures . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the problem of estimating the degree of entanglement of a bipartite system can not be analyzed separately from the measurement process that changes the system and from the intended application of the generated entanglement . </S>"
