    "line - driven winds ( hereafter ldws ) are expected around luminous objects whose spectra peak in the uv , such as ob  stars and accretion disks , stellar and galactic .",
    "feldmeier & shlosman ( 1999 , paper  i ) have investigated a 2-d analytical model of ldws from disks in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) characterized by a large mass transfer rate from the secondary to the white dwarf .",
    "such cvs , i.e. , novalike variables and dwarf novae in outburst , show clear signs of outflows driven by radiation pressure ( paper  i and refs .  therein ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations of time - dependent 2-d disk winds by proga , stone , & drew ( 1998 ; psd hereafter ) largely confirmed the previous kinematical studies by shlosman & vitello ( 1993 ) and knigge , woods , & drew ( 1995 ) , and delineated a number of empirical relationships which require further physical explanation .",
    "paper  i has addressed the 2-d geometry of the wind streamlines and the topology of solutions to the wind momentum equation . in particular , a comparison with the psd model was made as well as a comparison with the 1-d ldws from ob  stars .",
    "the main results of paper  i are as follows .",
    "firstly , the solutions to the wind momentum equation are characterized by two eigenvalues , the mass loss rate and the flow tilt angle with the disk , in the presence of a realistic radiation field above the disk .",
    "the existence of the second eigenvalue is a reflection of the multi - dimensional nature of a disk wind .",
    "the wind itself appears to be collimated to a certain degree , i.e. , the wind collimation angle with the rotation axis ( semi - opening angle ) is about @xmath4 for the wind launched within 4 white dwarf radii , and about @xmath5 for the outer wind , for the shakura - sunyaev ( 1973 ; shs hereafter ) disk .",
    "furthermore , the wind collimation depends solely on the radial temperature stratification in the disk , unless there is an additional degree of freedom such as a central luminosity associated with nuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "the above degree of collimation for disk winds in cvs should be taken with caution at large distances from the disk .",
    "secondly , a major distinction between stellar and disk ldws is the existence of maxima in both the gravity and the radiation flux above the disk .",
    "this behavior of gravity and radiation flux results in profound topological differences in the solutions to the stellar and disk wind momentum equations .",
    "we find that two distinct regions of disk wind exist , the inner and outer winds .",
    "the critical point of the outer wind lies close to the disk photosphere and to the sonic point , upstream of the top of the gravity ` hill ' .",
    "this proximity of the critical and sonic points is typical of ldws from o  stars as well . on the other hand , for the inner wind",
    ", the critical point lies far away from the sonic point , beyond the gravity hill .",
    "observationally , the mass loss rates from cv disk winds are poorly constrained .",
    "this is mainly a consequence of uncertainties in the ionizing fluxes from different components in the system , and , therefore , of the ionization stratification of the wind .",
    "neglecting the boundary layer and assuming a local blackbody radiation from the disk , vitello & shlosman ( 1993 ) and knigge  et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) find wind mass loss rates @xmath6% of the accretion rate , by fitting observed p  cygni line profiles .",
    "for a system of luminosity @xmath7 , this corresponds to a mass loss rate of about @xmath8 .",
    "these mass loss rates are _ upper _ limits for the following reason .",
    "the continuum radiation field shortwards of the lyman edge is often found ( polidan , mauche , & wade 1990 ; long  et  al .",
    "1991 , 1994 ; van teeseling , verbunt , & heise 1993 ; knigge  et  al .",
    "1997 ) to be highly supressed compared to blackbody emission or stellar photospheric fluxes , or is even absent .",
    "this drastic reduction in ionizing flux allows to reduce the electron density , and , therefore , @xmath9 , while maintaining the same degree of ionization in the wind .    on the other hand , a reasonable _",
    "lower _ limit to the wind mass loss rate from luminous cv disks was found by prinja & rosen ( 1995 ) .",
    "they argued that the product @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the ionization fraction of c  iv , lies between @xmath12 and @xmath13 for ten dwarf novae and novalike variables with high - resolution iue spectra ( see also mauche & raymond 1987 ; hoare & drew 1993 ) .",
    "this results in a lower limit of @xmath14 .",
    "note that this value is still model dependent to some degree , since prinja & rosen assumed a constant ionization fraction throughout the wind , and a purely radial flow .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the mass loss rate and the velocity law of disk ldws in cvs .",
    "we employ the main assumption of paper  i that the wind streamlines are contained in straight cones , whose collimation angles are eigenvalues of the flow .",
    "this approximation is acceptable close to the disk ( e.g. , as shown by psd ) and allows us to make a meaningful determination of the mass loss rate ( which is constrained close to the disk photosphere as well ) , and of the initial velocity law .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached from line fitting using 2-d wind kinematics ( vitello & shlosman 1993 ; knigge  et  al .",
    "1995 ) . on the other hand , we expect both the centrifugal forces and the polar component of the line force to bend the streamlines at large distances from the disk , and to influence the terminal velocity of the flow .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 reviews the mass loss rates derived from cak theory , section  3 shows that cv disk winds are expected to have low optical depth even in strong lines .",
    "sections  4 and 5 derive the mass loss rates and velocity laws for the disk wind model .",
    "sections  6 and 7 discuss and summarize our results .",
    "the cak line force for stellar winds is fully determined by two parameters , the power exponent @xmath15 and the mass absorption coefficient of the strongest driving line , @xmath16 ( paper  i ; puls , springmann , & lennon 1999 ) .",
    "instead of using @xmath16 directly , cak parameterize the line force per unit mass as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the so - called force multiplier , and @xmath19 is the force due to electron scattering .",
    "the optical depth @xmath20 refers to a line with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the electron scattering coefficient .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is given in terms of @xmath16 by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the complete gamma function , and @xmath26 is the thermal speed of carbon ions ( cak ) or hydrogen ( abbott 1982 ) .",
    "the above parameterization for @xmath27 as a power law , however , does not account correctly for optically thin winds , where the force multiplier saturates at some value @xmath28 for a gas of solar composition ( abbott 1982 ) .",
    "this particular value of @xmath29 was determined for o  stars .",
    "however , already for winds from b  stars near - the - main sequence , modeling of x - ray spectra suggests that mass loss rates inferred from the standard theory can be substantially underestimated ( cassinelli 1994 ; cassinelli  et  al .",
    "1994 ) . in terms of @xmath29 , @xmath16",

    "otherwise , the gravity prevails and no wind solution exists . for the above value of @xmath29 , and assuming @xmath34 and an eddington factor @xmath35 of an o supergiants , eq .",
    "( [ gayleysmasslosseq ] ) gives @xmath36 .",
    "the mass loss rate from cak theory agrees thus well with the estimate from the single scattering limit , @xmath37 , for typical terminal speeds @xmath38 . however , agreement between both mass loss rates is solely due to the fact that @xmath39 is close to unity .",
    "if , alternatively , @xmath40 , the cak mass loss rate falls well below the single scattering limit . as we show in the next section , the mass loss of a disk ldw is given again by eq .",
    "( [ gayleysmasslosseq ] ) , up to correction factors of order unity . even for the brightest cvs , i.e. , novalike variables and dwarf novae in eruption , which experience ldws , @xmath41 ( applying the o  star value of @xmath29 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath42 from eq .",
    "( [ gayleysmasslosseq ] ) , whereas the single scattering limit gives @xmath43 , for @xmath44 . since in thin ldws the probability for a photon to be scattered by a line is less than unity , the estimate from the single scattering is way too high ( see also puls , springmann , & owocki 1998 ) .",
    "a number of fundamental differences exist between stellar and disk ldws in cvs , some of them discussed in paper  i. here we show that optical depths for cv winds are more typical of thin winds , e.g. , of b  stars near - the - main sequence , than of more extensive supergiant winds .",
    "the disk wind geometry is described in paper  i , and we repeat here only the essential assumptions and make necessary definitions .",
    "a flow streamline is a helix which is contained within a _ straight _ cone ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the footpoint radius of a streamline in the disk is @xmath45 , the tilt of the cone with the disk is @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the distance along the cone .",
    "we neglect pressure forces , and assume that the azimuthal velocity is determined by angular momentum conservation above the disk , and by keplerian rotation within the disk .",
    "the only remaining velocity component is @xmath48 , which points upwards along the cone .",
    "we introduce a normalized coordinate @xmath49 .",
    "the velocity @xmath50 is normalized to the local escape speed , and the flow acceleration becomes @xmath51 .",
    "lastly , we introduce the radiation flux @xmath52 above the disk and the flux @xmath53 normalized to the footpoint flux of the streamline , as well as their projected counterparts @xmath54 and @xmath55 along the wind cone ( section 3.2 of paper  i ) .      in this section ,",
    "we make use of a simplified euler equation for the disk ldw to show explicitly that low @xmath39 factors in cv disks imply low optical depths in the wind . by doing so , we neglect factors of order unity from the angle integration in eq .",
    "( i.2 ) , in replacing @xmath56 by @xmath57 . for simplicity ,",

    "one has that @xmath71 .    for a stationary wind solution to exist , the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ euler_justsowind ] ) has to be positive .",
    "this poses a constraint on @xmath27 and therefore on @xmath20 .",
    "namely , the maximum of reduced gravity @xmath62 lies between @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "since @xmath55 is of order unity ( see fig .",
    "i.5 ) , @xmath27 approaches its maximum value , @xmath29 , in regions of large gravity , and stays constant thereafter .",
    "in other words , because @xmath39 is so small for cv disks , the wind solution barely ` makes it ' over the gravity hill .",
    "this saturation effect in @xmath27 happens when the strongest driving line in the wind becomes optically thin , at about @xmath76 .",
    "if this thick - to - thin transition occurs before or at the critical point of the flow , the wind solution is lost .",
    "this possiblity can not be excluded in our model due to the rapid change of the velocity gradient ( and hence of @xmath20 ) in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "the consequences of this effect on the feasibility of ldws are discussed in section  [ discussion ] .",

    "the highest mass loss rate solution ( hence , the slowest wind ) is characterized by the lowest allowable @xmath80 .",
    "the permitted range in @xmath27 corresponds to an even wider range in @xmath20 ( because @xmath81 ) , @xmath82 .",
    "we further quantify these arguments in appendix a.    our estimate for @xmath20 in cv winds contradicts the claim by murray & chang ( 1996 ) that the optical depth parameter @xmath20 is similar for cv disk and o  star winds .",
    "the mass loss rate of the vertical wind above an isothermal disk is determined by the eigenvalue @xmath31 in eq .",

    "interestingly , the mass loss rates for a vertical wind above an isothermal disk and for tilted winds above disks with temperature stratification are very similar .",

    "the latter is aligned with the radiation flux . for the disk types used in the present work ,",
    "this range encompasses @xmath112 , according to table  i.1 .",
    "it is readily shown that the mass loss rate for a ldw due to a single , optically thick line is roughly @xmath113 .",
    "the above @xmath114 , therefore , implies that only few lines become optically thick in the present cv disk wind model . unlike for disk winds , in o  star winds of the order of 100 lines become optically thick according to eq .",

    "finally , we derive the dependence of the mass loss rate @xmath117 on @xmath45 . according to ( i.17 ) , this relation is determined by the disk temperature stratification and the run of @xmath31 with @xmath45 . for an isothermal disk , @xmath31 was found to be independent of @xmath45 , hence @xmath118 .",
    "such an unrealistic growth of @xmath119 with radius is a consequence of the increase of radiation energy with @xmath45 .",

    "the total disk mass loss rate scales therefore roughly as @xmath123 . for the shs disk , approximately @xmath124 for @xmath122 . at smaller @xmath45 ,",
    "the radial dependency is weak for both types of disks .",
    "therefore , the mass loss rate @xmath9 is centrally concentrated , and more so for shs disks .",
    "we discuss the wind velocity law by solving the euler equation , first neglecting , then accounting for ionization effects in the flow .",
    "only the flow above the shs disk is analyzed in this section .",
    "the geometrical expansion terms , discussed in section 5.1 of paper  i , introduce a velocity dependency into the wind euler equation . however , we find that these terms leave the mass loss rates in the model practically unchanged , and increase the wind velocity by at most 10% .",
    "the reason for this is the small angle dispersion in the wind streamlines .",
    "we , therefore , omit geometrical expansion terms here .    without explicit dependence on velocity ,",
    "the euler equation becomes purely algebraic .",

    ", the ldw velocity law is not a monotonic function of @xmath127 . clearly , the deceleration regime ( marked with a cross in fig .  [ velocitylaw ] ) is unimportant for streamlines starting at large @xmath45 , because it lies at large @xmath127 where the flow moves much faster than the local escape speed .",
    "the inner streamlines do show a more pronounced kink .",
    "the wind terminal velocities are found to be independent of @xmath45 , for @xmath93 , and linearly dependent on @xmath45 for @xmath34 , growing by a factor of five over the whole disk .",
    "however , the above examples may be of academic interest only , since the wind is expected to go through an optically thick - to - thin transition beforehand .",
    "hence the actual observable terminal velocities may be smaller .",
    "note that we presume that the wind geometry stays unchanged at all @xmath127 , and neglect the saturation effect in the force multiplier at very small optical depths in the wind .",
    "both effects can influence the asymptotic wind dynamics .",

    "the reason for this is that @xmath133 is determined by the effective gravity and disk radiation field , i.e. , by the auxiliary functions @xmath62 and @xmath134 ( paper  i ) , which change on length scales @xmath135 .",
    "for this reason , we do not expect @xmath133 to depend on @xmath15 .",

    "the major concern of the present model is the small optical depth in the wind , where the latter appears to be semi - transparent even in the strongest driving lines , when @xmath101 is used .",
    "a possible resolution of this problem may be related to our neglect of ionization structure in the wind , which is expected to lead to a shallower velocity law and smaller velocity gradients . to proceed , we parameterize the ionization stratification in the simplest possible way , by introducing the @xmath137 parameter customarily used in stellar wind theory ( e.g. , abbott 1982 ) , namely @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the ionization parameter , with @xmath140 being the frequency - integrated mean intensity .",

    "in this section , we compare the mass loss rates from our model with values quoted in the literature , which are typically estimated from p  cygni line fits or from dynamical wind modeling .",

    ".      taken at face value , the modified cak theory of ldws from cv disks predicts surprisingly low mass loss rates when a line force parameter @xmath101 is used as in o  stars .",
    "the calculated rates of @xmath175 for @xmath176 ( or even lower , when the saturation of the force multiplier is accounted for ) , imply that ldws will have a thick - to - thin transition in the strongest driving lines , and will have difficulties in reproducing the observed line profiles .",
    "what are the possible solutions to this problem ?",
    "firstly , higher values of @xmath29 are the most obvious way to increase @xmath9 in the wind .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is highly uncertain .",
    "especially , it is unclear how the different spectral shape of disk radiation and its effect on the non - lte electron occupation numbers in ions will modify @xmath29 as compared to its o  star value .",
    "such calculations have never been attempted and are clearly beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "theoretically , the value of @xmath29 can be significantly larger than for the o  stars .",
    "analysis of o  star ldws revealed @xmath177 to be the key parameter determining the mass loss rate in the wind ( gayley 1995 ) .",
    "namely , for @xmath178 , the wind ceases to exist .",
    "however , for o  stars @xmath179 , producing a kind of a ` safety belt ' .",
    "the situation is different for winds from luminous cv disks , where @xmath180 , if the o  star value for @xmath29 is used ( this work and psd ) .",
    "this was already foreseen by vitello & shlosman ( 1988 ) , which claimed that the disk winds appear to be much more restrictive than o  star winds .",
    "secondly , the cak line force does not account for the ionization stratification in the wind .",
    "so a situation can arise where the wind is driven by the part of the disk which is uv bright , while the ionization is controlled by the central disk region , e.g. , the boundary layer , which is x - ray bright .",
    "this will be especially pronounced in the presence of a lyman continuum cutoff in the uv source . under these circumstances , due to the wind over - ionization",
    ", the line force will be reduced below its cak value ( macgregor , hartmann , & raymond 1979 ; fransson & fabian 1980 ) and hence the velocity gradient as well .",
    "a shallow velocity law will increase the overall optical depth in the wind and push the thick - to - thin transition downstream , away from the critical point .",
    "it is important in this context that the minimal changes in the p  cygni line profiles in eclipsing novalike cvs _ require _ very shallow velocity profiles in the wind ( e.g. , shlosman , vitello , & mauche 1996 ) .",
    "additional processes can affect the mass loss rates , however to a lesser degree .",
    "firstly , the assumption that each wind parcel is confined to a straight cone is a major limitation of the present model . for bended streamlines , a better alignment with the radiative flux vector seems possible , which should increase the mass loss .",
    "secondly , pauldrach & puls ( 1990 ) find a sudden increase in stellar mass loss rates of b supergiants when the lyman continuum becomes optically thick at the wind base , e.g. , when the effective temperature drops below a certain threshold or if @xmath39 reaches some critical value .",
    "this induces a shift to lower wind ionization , which in turn increases the mass loss ( more driving lines ) , increases the lyman jump even more and so on , until a stable situation with high @xmath9 and low wind ionization is reached .",
    "thirdly , @xmath29 depends linearly on the wind metallicity , and enhanced metal abundances could lead to a larger @xmath181 , which governs the mass loss .",
    "this is significant in particular to the he abundance due to the efficient convection in the low - mass secondary stars , but may be relevant to metals as well .",
    "the focus of this second paper on line - driven winds from accretion disks in cataclysmic variables is on the theoretical estimates of the mass loss rates and wind velocity laws .",
    "our results are as follows .    the derived mass loss rate using the modified cak formalism appears to be substantially smaller than that inferred from p  cygni line fits , even with supressed lyman continuum , and",
    "more so when the saturation effect in the line force multiplier is included . yet",
    "this rate is in a good agreement with results from time - dependent , 2-d dynamical wind simulations by psd .",
    "the reason for low mass loss rates is that the key parameter controlling ldws , @xmath182 for o  star winds , is only @xmath6 for disk winds , when o  star values for @xmath29 are used .",
    "some potential resolutions to this problem were proposed .",
    "we find that the mass loss is dominated by the inner decade in disk radii .",
    "for the shakura & sunyaev and for newtonian disks , the mass loss per unit radius is roughly uniform out to five white dwarf radii , and drops @xmath183 and @xmath184 at larger @xmath185 , respectively .    due to their low mass loss rates",
    ", cv winds should experience a thick - to - thin transition even in the strongest lines .",
    "cv winds should , therefore , resemble more closely winds of b  stars near - the - main sequence than of o  supergiants .",
    "the wind velocity profiles show a slowly accelerating flow , with a characteristic acceleration length given by the footpoint radius of the streamline in the disk . fitting the observed line profiles using kinematical models suggest even slower accelerating winds .",
    "the observable terminal velocity of the wind is associated with the thick - to - thin transition in the driving lines . due to this latter fact , and due to uncertainties in the ionization stratification and in the anticipated streamline bending at large radii , the actual wind terminal velocity is poorly constrained in our model .",
    "we are grateful to jon bjorkman , rolf kudritzki , chris mauche , norman murray , stan owocki and joachim puls for numerous discussions on various aspects of line - driven winds .",

    "using the eigenvalues @xmath31 from paper  i , one can further quantify the disk eddington factors required to launch a line - driven wind which is optically thick at least up to the critical point .",
    "consider first a vertical wind above an infinite , isothermal disk .",
    "the euler equation ( [ euler_justsowind ] ) becomes , for @xmath186 ( the flux component along @xmath187 , normalized to the footpoint flux ) , @xmath188 from eq .",
