    "the scalar field model with potential @xmath1 is the simplest model exhibiting a rich phase structure and for studying tricritical phenomena in both two and three dimensional systems [ see , _ e.g. _ refs . @xcite and @xcite ] . in terms of the phase diagram for the model ,",
    "a tricritical point can emerge whenever we have three phases coexisting simultaneously . for the above potential , in the absence of corrections due to fluctuations , one can have a second order transition in @xmath2 when the scalar field mass vanishes and @xmath3 .",
    "a first order transition happens for the case of @xmath4 .",
    "the tricritical point occurs when the quartic coupling constant vanishes ( with @xmath5 ) .",
    "a study of the phase diagram for this model in @xmath6 , at finite temperature , was recently done @xcite and it has been shown that there is a temperature @xmath7 for which the physical thermal mass @xmath8 and coupling constant @xmath9 vanishes , thus characterizing the tricritical point .",
    "there are many possible applications associated with the model with potential @xmath10 with @xmath11 interaction .",
    "for instance , in @xmath12 , it is known @xcite that the minimal conformal quantum field theory , with central charge @xmath13 ( the tricritical ising model ) is in the same universality class , in the scaling region near the tricritical point , of the landau - ginzburg model with the above potential .",
    "this @xmath11 potential model can then be thought of as the continuum realization of the ising model with possible applications in , _",
    "e.g. _ , the description of adsorbed helium on krypton - plated graphite @xcite , in understanding the statistical mechanics of binary mixtures , such as @xmath14 @xcite , etc .",
    "these are just a few examples of systems exhibiting tricritical phenomena in condensed matter physics .    in field theory in general , the @xmath11 model has been used in the study of polarons , or solitonic like field configurations on systems of low dimensionality @xcite .",
    "also , a gauged ( @xmath15 ) version of the @xmath11 potential model in euclidean @xmath6 , has recently been used to study a possible existence of a tricritical point in higgs models at high temperatures @xcite . in this context",
    "the tricritical point is characterized by the ratio of the quartic coupling constant and the gauge coupling constant of the effective three - dimensional theory , obtained from the @xmath16 high temperature , dimensionally reduced @xmath15 higgs model .",
    "this can be particularly useful in the context of the study of the electroweak phase transition .",
    "there are then many reasons that make the @xmath11 potential model an interesting model to be studied . in this paper",

    "we will compute the vacuum decay ( tunneling ) rate at both zero and finite temperature . for calculation reasons we will restrict ourselves to the thin wall approximation for the true vacuum bubble ( or bounce solution ) .",
    "we then consider the energy - density difference between the true and false vacuum as very small as compared with the height of the barrier of the @xmath10 potential @xcite . from this , we are able to give the explicit expression for the bounce and also to qualitatively describe the eigensolutions for the bounce configuration .",

    "the picture we have in mind is that once the system is prepared in the false vacuum state , it will evolve to the true vacuum state by tunneling ( at zero temperature ) or by bubble nucleation , triggered by thermal fluctuations over the potential barrier .    in the case of quantum field theory at zero temperature the study of the decay of false vacuum was initiated by voloshin , kobsarev and okun @xcite and later by callan and coleman @xcite , who developed the so called bounce method for the theory of quantum decay . in this context",

    "the calculation of the decay rate were first considered in @xcite in the context of quantum mechanics and later by linde @xcite , for quantum field theory . in @xcite , it is argued that temperature corrections to the nucleation rate are obtained recalling that finite temperature field theory ( at sufficiently high temperatures ) in @xmath42 dimensions is equivalent to d - dimensional euclidean quantum field theory with @xmath43 substituted by @xmath44 . at finite temperature , the bounce , @xmath45 ( @xmath46    with boundary conditions : @xmath47 and @xmath48 . the vacuum decay rate , or bubble nucleation rate in this case , is proportional to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the nucleation barrier , given by ( @xmath51 )    @xmath52 \\ ; , \\label{deltae}\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 is the euclidean lagrangian density .",
    "the problem of the computation of the nucleation rate at finite temperature was recently reconsidered by gleiser , marques and ramos @xcite , who have used the early works of langer @xcite . in this context",
    "the nucleation rate is given by    @xmath54_{\\beta}}{{\\rm det } \\left[-\\box_{e}+u''(\\phi_f ) \\right]_{\\beta}}\\right]^{-1/2 } e^{-\\delta e / t}\\left(1+{\\cal o}(\\hbar)\\right ) \\ ; , \\label{reconcha}\\ ] ]    where @xmath55 is the negative eigenvalue associated to the operator @xmath56 $ ] .",
