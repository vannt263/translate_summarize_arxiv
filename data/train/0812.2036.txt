    "vigorous ( sf ) is one mechanism thought to be responsible for the creation of the holes and shells observed in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of a wide variety of galaxies . following a strong episode of sf ,",
    "energy input into the ism from young massive stars ( e.g. , stellar winds , type  ii  supernovae ) can provide sufficient mechanical energy to create these holes and shells and may even trigger secondary sf around the edges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although observations of young stellar clusters inside these ism features confirm that this is one possible scenario , a majority of holes and shells do not contain bright associated young clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one explanation is that only a select few ism holes and shells have been observed with sufficient photometric depth to detect the associated clusters .",
    "alternatively , a number of competing theories suggest the origins of holes and shells in the ism are from mechanisms other than stellar feedback , e.g. , high velocity cloud collisions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gamma ray bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , stochastic sf propagation @xcite .",
    "dwarf irregular galaxies ( dis ) provide excellent environments in which we can study the creation mechanisms of these ism features .",
    "larger galaxies exhibit differential rotation and sheer , which can destroy the holes and shells in the ism on timescales as short as 10@xmath2 year .",
    "however , dis are typically solid body rotators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which allows features in the ism to grow to large sizes ( @xmath0 1 kpc ) and stay coherent over longer time scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nearby dis are particularly convenient probes of the interplay between sf and the ism , because we can directly compare the resolved stellar populations to the hi  component to better understand mechanisms of feedback . at a distance of @xmath0 4 mpc @xcite ,",
    "ic  2574 , an m81 group di , contains a `` supergiant shell '' ( sgs ) ( denoted by the red ellipse in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ f1 ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is an excellent candidate for specifically studying both the formation of the sgs and subsequent triggered sf around its rim .",
    "@xcite classify the sgs as an ellipse ( @xmath0 1000 @xmath3 500 pc ) , however note that many of the holes and shells in ic  2574 are elongated due to projection effects ( the de - projected diameter is @xmath0 700 pc ) .",
    "they further note there is some evidence that the sgs is a superposition of two merged shells @xcite , which could account for its elliptical shape .",
    "in addition to the shape , the expansion of the sgs is somewhat uncertain .",
    "@xcite measure an hi  expansion velocity of 25  from a break in the pv - diagram , which is only an indirect measure of expansion , and in fact is consistent with stalled expansion as well .",
    "we discuss the implications of these scenarios in  4 .",
    "uv observations show a young stellar cluster ( @xmath0 11 myr old , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) inside the sgs , but no h@xmath4  emission is observed from the interior . around the rim , strong h@xmath4  ( and mid - ir ) emission is observed ( see panel ( c ) of figure [ f1 ] , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicating sf at these locations within the past @xmath0 5 myr .    in this paper , we use deep hst / acs imaging of the resolved stellar populations of the sgs to measure its recent sfh ( @xmath5 500 myr ) .",
    "we use the unique properties of resolved blue helium burning stars ( bhebs ) to trace the spatial locations of the sf episodes , resulting in a movie that shows how sf propagated in the vicinity of the sgs over the past 500 myr . from these lines of evidence ,",
    "we are able to directly explore the sf event(s ) responsible for the creation of the sgs and triggering of secondary sf .",
    "we used hst / acs to observe the region of ic  2574 containing the sgs on 2004 , february 6 in three wide band filters f435w ( b ) , f555w ( v ) , and f814w ( i ) .",
    "the images were processed using the hst pipeline and photometry was extracted using dolphot , a version of hstphot @xcite with an acs specific module . to account for photometric completeness , we performed artificial star tests .",
    "after filtering out cosmic rays , hot pixels , and extended sources from the photometry we had 253,736 well measured stars in the acs field of view .",
    "subsequently , we isolated the sgs region and found 24,912 well measured stars in the f555w and f814w filters .",
    "the limiting magnitude of our photometry in this region is m@xmath6 @xmath0 0 , which gives us excellent leverage on sf in the past @xmath0 1 gyr @xcite . the photometry was carried out as part of a larger study of m81  group dis and full details of the observations , photometry , and completeness can be found in @xcite .",
    "we measured the sfh of the sgs region ( the entirety of panel ( c ) in figure [ f1 ] ) of ic  2574 from the hst / acs based color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) using the code of @xcite .",
    "this method constructs synthetically generated cmds , using the stellar evolution models of @xcite , and compares them to the observed cmd using a maximum likelihood technique . to obtain this solution",
    ", we used a combination of fixed ( e.g , binary fraction , initial mass function ) and searchable ( e.g. , distance , extinction ) parameters . for consistency",
    ", we set all our parameters to the values found for ic  2574 listed in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "to quantify the uncertainties of the sfh , we added the systematic uncertainties from the isochrones and the statistical uncertainties from monte carlo tests in quadrature ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we used the cmd of the sgs region ( see figure [ f2 ] ) as input into the sfh code .",
    "the sfh of the sgs region over the past 500 myr is shown in the top panel of figure [ f3 ] . for reference",
    ", we show the sfr of the sgs region averaged over the lifetime of the galaxy as the red dashed line .",
    "we see that over the past 500 myr , the sfr is always higher than the lifetime averaged sfr , with notable increases at @xmath0 200 @xmath1 300 myr and within the last @xmath0 25 myr . from the most recent time bin ( 0 @xmath1 10 myr ) we see a dramatic increase in the sfr , which is in agreement with the h@xmath4  derived sfr for this region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because the sgs region , i.e. all of panel ( c ) in figure [ f1 ] , is larger than the sgs itself , we tested for the possibility that sf from the additional area influenced our sfh .",
    "we measured the sfh interior to the sgs only and found differences which were deemed insignificant .",
    "bhebs are powerful tools for studying both the ages and locations of sf from @xmath0 10 @xmath1 500 myr ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they provide us leverage because ( a ) this evolutionary phase is very short relative to the main sequence lifetime and ( b ) bhebs of different ages do not overlap on the cmd @xcite .",
    "the result is that we can create density maps of bhebs at different ages , which trace the spatial location of sf events over time .",
    "inherently uncertainties in distance , extinction , photometry , and isochrones can all affect the precise ages of the bhebs . because of the low metallicities in dis and the high quality of our acs data , we find the observational related uncertainties to be small , and have calculated isochrone based errors to be @xmath0 10% @xcite .",
    "in addition to uncertainties in ages , the locations of the bhebs can be influenced by proper motions of the stars .",
    "the stars we consider are thought to belong to clusters and are thus bound by gravity .",
    "although they will not remain gravitationally bound indefinitely , the time scale for dissipation of such stellar associations is @xmath0 600 myr to 1 gyr @xcite , much longer than the time scale we consider for the sgs . to transform the density of bhebs to a sfr per area , we multiply each density map by the corresponding sfr , measured using the code of @xcite , divide by the image area , and interpolate in both space and time to create a spatially resolved sfh movie .",
    "the final spatial resolution of the movie is @xmath0 8 , similar to that of the hi  observations , and the movie frames are then interpolated onto a grid with 5 myr sampling .",
    "figure [ f4 ] shows selected still frames from the spatially resolved sfh movie of the sgs region ; the outline of the sgs is indicated by the white ellipse .",
    "we can see that in the oldest frames , 500 and 350 myr , there is no major sf going on in the region . from 200 @xmath1 300 myr",
    ", we see that there is an elevated period of sf in the center of the sgs .",
    "a period of relative quiescence lasts until @xmath0 100 myr , when a sf event begins to strengthen inside the central regions of the sgs .",
    "the peak strength of this central event is at @xmath0 25 myr , after which sf subsides centrally , but increases in intensity on the rim .",
    "the location of the sf events in the center of the sgs and on the rim are in excellent agreement with observations from other wavelengths .",
    "the central event coincides well with uv observations by @xcite .",
    "the triggered sf on the rim is traced by h@xmath4  and spitzer ir imaging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is in excellent agreement with our 10 myr frame .",
    "the 200 @xmath1 300 myr event is beyond the look back time of the uv and ir fluxes , and is only traceable with the deep photometry presented here .",
    "to understand the current state of the sgs , we consider the energetics of both the hi  and sf , the role of triggered sf , and the timing of the events that led to the evacuation of the hi  and secondary sf around the rim . to do this we examine the efficiency of energy , i.e. the feedback efficiency , transfered from stellar feedback into moving the ism in the context of both an expanding and stalled shell .    following the model of @xcite",
    ", one can compute the energy necessary to evacuate the hi  mass interior to the sgs to be @xmath0 2@xmath310@xmath7 erg ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using starurst99 @xcite , we can independently calculate the energy associated with sf in the sgs region by inputting our sfh and assuming the same imf as was used to measure the sfh ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we computed the total cumulative kinetic energy ( i.e. , stellar winds and sne ) of the sgs region over the past 500 myr to be @xmath0 3@xmath310@xmath8 erg ( figure [ f3 ] ) .",
    "because of our relatively coarse time resolution , we need to consider that our elevated sf periods , may be shorter bursts averaged out over a longer time .",
    "thus , we used starburst99 to model the sfh as both a series of constant episodes of sf , as well instantaneous bursts for the elevated sf episodes and found the energetics to be consistent .    at first pass , it may seem that sf generates an unreasonably large amount of energy compared to the hi  energy requirement .",
    "however , by considering the feedback efficiency we can reconcile the apparent discrepancy . assuming that each sn imparts 10@xmath9 erg in into moving the ism we find a @xmath0 1%   stellar feedback efficiency , which is on the low end of the spectrum that ranges from @xmath0 1 @xmath1 20%  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , we have really computed a lower limit on the efficiency , as the hi  energy is a lower bound , and the sf energy is an upper bound .",
    "the hi  energy was computed using an assumed smooth uniform hi  distribution inside the sgs .",
    "given that the central sf event in the sgs was extremely powerful , it is likely that there was a higher density of gas interior to the sgs in the past ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the model of @xcite predicts that an increase in a factor of 10 in the gas density would change our feedback efficiency to @xmath0 10% .",
    "when we consider the energy input into the ism due to sf , only a fraction of this energy is used to move the ism , with the rest lost to heating and radition .",
    "simulations suggest @xmath0 10@xmath10 erg per sn is a more realistic amount of sn energy imparted into moving the ism @xcite , which also increases our feedback efficiency .",
    "finally , if the sgs has stalled expansion and broken out of the plane of the galaxy , the energy from sf simply escapes and does not go into moving the ism . despite the large uncertainties in the calculations of both energy quantities , we find that our feedback efficiency falls in the range of the values typically calculated from simulations , indicating the sf generated an appropriate amount of energy for creation of the sgs .",
    "the sgs presents a clear case of not only sequential sf , but also triggered ( i.e. , causally connected ) sf . from the spatially resolved sfh movie ( figure [ f4 ] ) , we see clearly that the central burst predates the sf on the rim , which is in excellent agreement with age estimates in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "establishing a causal relationship between sf events is generally non - trivial and only a handful of cases of triggered sf have been established ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the case of the sgs",
    ", we have a recent sf episode interior to the sgs , which peaked @xmath0 25 myr ago and the bulk of the recent sf on the rim is @xmath5 10 myr old , indicated by both the sf movie and the h@xmath4  observations .",
    "thus , it appears that the central sf event initiated the expansion of the shell , which swept up the ism , and when the gas on the rim becomes sufficiently dense , secondary sf began . as a slight twist to this scenario , we can speculate about the role of the older ( 200 @xmath1 300 myr ) , central sf event . because of the location of the older event and energy input into the ism , it is possible that this older event cleared out some or all of the sgs , and the more recent event simply served to accelerate the expansion and trigger the sf around the rim . or perhaps the older event created one spherical shell , which merged with a younger shell to account for the ellipticity of the sgs . to better our understanding of the role of both young and old sf events in reshaping the ism , we will need to employ similar analysis techniques on a statistically significant sample of holes and shells in the ism of nearby dis .",
