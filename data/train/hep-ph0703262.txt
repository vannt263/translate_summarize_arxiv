    "among the recent extra  dimensional effective scenarios , the one proposed by randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite , based on an additional warped dimension , seems quite attractive .",
    "the rs scenario provides a favorable framework for alternative models of electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking , like the higgsless @xcite , gauge  higgs unification @xcite or composite higgs @xcite models . from a more generic point of view",
    ", the rs scenario can address the gauge hierarchy problem without introducing any new energy scale in the fundamental theory .",
    "moreover , the variant of the original rs model , with standard model ( sm ) fermions and bosons propagating in the bulk , allows for the unification of gauge coupling constants at a high energy grand unification scale @xcite and provides viable candidates of kaluza ",
    "klein ( kk ) type for the dark matter of the universe @xcite .",
    "+ in this version of the rs model with bulk matter , a purely geometrical origin arises naturally for the large mass hierarchies prevailing among sm fermions @xcite .",
    "the principle is that if the various sm fermions are displaced along the extra dimension , their different wave function overlaps with the higgs boson ( which remains confined on the so  called tev ",
    "brane for its mass to be protected ) generate hierarchical patterns among the effective 4dimensional yukawa couplings .",
    "with such a geometrical approach , the quark masses and ckm mixing angles can be accommodated @xcite , as well as the lepton masses and mns mixing angles in both cases where neutrinos have masses of type majorana @xcite or dirac @xcite .    in the framework of the rs model with bulk fields ,",
    "if the gauge hierarchy problem is to be solved , the mass of the first kk excitation of sm gauge bosons must be of order of the tev scale .",
    "hence , kk excitations of gauge bosons are expected to be produced significantly at the forthcoming large hadron collider ( lhc ) , which provides a center - of - mass energy of @xmath4 tev , for kk gauge boson couplings to light quarks of the same order as the sm gauge couplings .    in the present work ,",
    "we develop a test of kk excitation effects at lhc , in the rs scenario with bulk fields generating the sm fermion masses : we study the direct contributions of kk excitations of the photon and of the @xmath5 boson to the sm drell  yan process , namely @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the kk  level .",
    "the motivation for considering this process is that the neutral kk excitations can be produced as resonances , tending to increase considerably the total amplitude .",
    "moreover , the di  lepton final state constitutes a particularly clean signature in an hadronic collider environment . + in the framework of the rs model with bulk matter , the high energy collider phenomenology and flavour physics",
    "are interestingly connected : the effective 4dimensional couplings between kk gauge boson modes and sm fermions depend on fermion localizations along the extra  dimension which are fixed ( non uniquely ) by fermion masses . in the present study for the lhc , this connection between collider and flavour physics will be taken into account as we will consider some fermion location configurations which reproduce all the quark / lepton masses and mixing angles , and , satisfy flavour changing neutral current  ( fcnc ) constraints for masses of the first kk gauge bosons around the tev scale ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for general discussions on these fcnc effects and ref .",
    "@xcite for experimental status ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the preliminary study @xcite on the reaction @xmath6 in the rs model , which was performed under the assumption of universal fermion locations ( in order to totally avoid fcnc effects ) so that sm fermion mass hierarchies were not able to be generated .",
    "usually , the production of heaviest sm fermions ( typically localized towards the tev  brane to have a large overlap with the higgs boson ) are considered to be favored due to their larger couplings to kk gauge bosons ( also located near the tev ",
    "this has motivated recently the study , in the rs model , of the top quark pair production at lhc ( through direct kk gluon production ) @xcite and ilc ( via virtual @xmath8 exchanges ) @xcite . nevertheless ,",
    "as will be discussed , if the left  handed charged leptons are localized closely to the tev ",
    "brane whereas the right  handed ones are rather close to the planck ",
    "brane , the lepton masses can still be small enough and compatible with significant couplings between left ",
    "handed charged leptons and kk gauge bosons .",
    "such large kk couplings of leptons could be in agreement with the constraints from the ew precision data on @xmath9 vertex if one assumes a custodial symmetry @xcite and more precisely an @xmath1 symmetry @xcite .",
    "this @xmath1 symmetry will also allow to generate the heavy top mass , and simultaneously , protect the @xmath10 coupling as well as @xmath11 against too large corrections from kk state exchanges ( the elimination of this tension was the original motivation for introducing the @xmath1 symmetry @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the leptonic signature which is studied here is characteristic of the phenomenology of the rs scenario with a custodial @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in next section ,",
    "the theoretical context is described , whereas in section  [ phenobounds ] , the relevant phenomenological constraints are discussed .",
    "the search at lhc is studied in section  [ lhc ] , and conclusions are drawn in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "we begin by discussing the values of fundamental parameters in the rs model . while on the planck  brane the effective gravity scale is equal to the ( reduced ) planck mass : @xmath12 gev , on the tev  brane the gravity scale , @xmath13 , is suppressed by the exponential ` warp ' factor @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the curvature radius of anti  de  sitter space and @xmath16 the compactification radius . for a small extra dimension @xmath17 ( @xmath18",
    "is taken close to @xmath19 ) , one finds @xmath20 so that @xmath21 tev , thus solving the gauge hierarchy problem . solving the gauge hierarchy problem forces @xmath22 ( the mass of the first kk excitation of sm gauge bosons : @xmath23 ) to be of order of the tev scale .",
    "indeed , one has @xmath24 tev since the theoretical consistency bound on the 5dimensional curvature scalar leads to @xmath25 .",
    "more precisely , the maximal value of @xmath22 is fixed by this theoretical consistency bound and the @xmath26 value .",
    "one could consider a maximal value of @xmath27 tev which corresponds to @xmath28 .",
    "since we are interested in the search for kk state effects at lhc , @xmath22 will be taken instead of @xmath18 as the free parameter , which is equivalent .",
    "concerning the mass values for the sm fermions , they are dictated by their wave function location . in order to control these locations , the 5dimensional fermion fields @xmath29 ( the generation index @xmath30 )",
    "are usually coupled to distinct masses @xmath31 in the fundamental theory .",
    "if @xmath32 , where @xmath33 parameterizes the fifth dimension and @xmath34 are dimensionless parameters , the fields decompose as @xmath35 , where @xmath7 labels the tower of kk excitations and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 being just a normalization factor ) . hence , as @xmath38 increases , the wave function @xmath39 tends to approach the planck ",
    "brane at @xmath40 .",
    "we finish this section by recalling how the locations of fermions fix their effective 4dimensional couplings to kk gauge bosons .",
    "the neutral current action of the effective 4dimensional coupling , between sm fermions @xmath41 and kk excitations of any neutral gauge boson @xmath42 , reads in the interaction basis as , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the relevant sm gauge coupling constant and @xmath45 the @xmath46 diagonal matrix @xmath47 .",
    "these factors @xmath48 quantify the wave function overlap ( along the extra dimension ) between the localized kk excitation of gauge boson @xmath49 and the localized sm fermions @xmath50 . in case of the rs model , the expression for coefficient @xmath48",
    "is given e.g. by the coefficient @xmath51 defined in ref .",
    "+ the action in eq.([sweak ] ) can be rewritten in the mass basis ( indicated by the prime ) : @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 being the unitary matrix of basis transformation for left ",
    "handed fermions and @xmath55 being flavour indices .",
    "one can see that the non  universality of the effective coupling constants @xmath56 between kk modes of the gauge fields and the three sm fermion families ( which have different locations along @xmath33 ) , in the interaction basis , induces non vanishing off  diagonal elements for matrix @xmath57 , in the mass basis , giving rise to flavour changing ( fc ) couplings .",
    "@xmath58 * fermion masses : * in this paper , for the purpose of illustration , three characteristic examples of complete sets for the @xmath38 parameter values are considered : the sets a , b and c presented in the appendix .",
    "+ the three fermion localization configurations , corresponding to sets a , b and c , have been shown in @xcite to reproduce all the present data on quark / lepton masses and mixing angles ( in case of dirac neutrino masses induced by the presence of three right  handed neutrinos ) , through the geometrical mechanism @xcite described in section  [ intro ] .",
    "the effective quark / lepton mass matrices , generated via this mechanism , depend on the @xmath38 and the rs parameter product @xmath26 , which was fixed in @xcite to the same amount as here .",
    "+ in particular , for these three sets , the unusually low @xmath59 values ( @xmath60 ) for left  handed charged leptons are compensated by some large @xmath61 values for right  handed ones so that the correct electron , muon and tau masses can be generated .",
    ".5 cm    @xmath58 * fcnc effects : * the indirect phenomenological constraints on @xmath22 holding in the rs model with bulk matter must be considered . the experimental limits on fcnc processes translate into a lower bound on @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , within the context of the rs scenario creating fermion masses , fcnc processes are induced at tree level by exchanges of kk excitations of neutral gauge bosons .",
    "this is rendered possible by the fact that these kk states possess fc couplings to fermions ( _ c.f .",
    "_ eq.([sphysical ] ) ) .",
    "this is necessary as the mass hierarchies and mixings of sm fermions require flavour and nature dependent locations for quarks / leptons , or equivalently ( as described in previous section ) , different @xmath38 parameter values .",
    "+ the fc couplings between kk gauge bosons and sm fermions are significantly suppressed for @xmath38 values corresponding to certain configurations of fermion localizations",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) . for these localization configurations , experimental limits on kk",
    " induced fcnc effects are satisfied even for rather low kk masses .",
    "sets a , b , c of @xmath38 values given in the appendix correspond to such configurations : for these three sets of @xmath38 values , it was shown in @xcite that fcnc reactions in both the hadron and lepton sector ( like @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ,  ) respect the experimental limits if @xmath66 tev .",
    ".5 cm    @xmath58 * ew measurements : * secondly , the mixing between the ew gauge bosons and their kk modes induces modifications of the boson masses / couplings , and thus deviations to ew precision observables . hence , the fit of ew precision data imposes the typical bound @xmath67 tev @xcite . thus we first consider the scenario with the ew gauge symmetry enhanced to @xmath68 @xcite down to a few tev : the scenario with brane localized kinetic terms for fermions @xcite or gauge bosons @xcite ( see @xcite for gauge boson kinetic terms and @xcite for fermion ones ) . ] leading to reasonable fit of the oblique s , t parameters for @xmath69 tev and the @xmath70 ( for right  handed sm fermions ) configurations considered in our a , b , c sets , namely @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 ( @xmath74 being the generation index ) . in the three sets , the low @xmath75 and @xmath76 values ( pushing typically the @xmath77,@xmath78 towards the tev ",
    "brane ) , needed to generate the large top mass , give rise to significant @xmath78 couplings to kk gauge bosons .",
    "so in order to force the deviations ( from both the mixing with kk gauge bosons and kk fermions ) of the @xmath79 coupling to vanish for any @xmath76 value , while still protecting the @xmath80 parameter against radiative corrections ( by the already mentioned custodial @xmath1 symmetry ) , the third family left  handed sm quark doublet @xmath81 is embedded in a bidoublet @xmath82 under the extended ew symmetry , as proposed in @xcite and in contrast with @xcite .",
    "the two other @xmath83 light quark doublets are also embedded in bidoublets @xmath82 .",
    "then the @xmath84 quarks must belong to a representation corresponding to @xmath85 , which protects the @xmath86 vertex against any kk contribution @xcite .",
    "as suggested recently in @xcite , the three families of left  handed sm lepton doublets @xmath87",
    "are similarly embedded into bidoublets @xmath88 .",
    "this guarantees that there are no modifications of the @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 couplings , even for our chosen relatively low @xmath92 values that lead to a significant enhancement in the couplings between left  handed charged leptons and kk gauge bosons . if light fermions are localized far from the tev ",

    "the set a has @xmath95 values much smaller than @xmath96 and should be excluded by ew constraints , but we just consider it in order to illustrate a strong coupling regime .",
    "let us describe more precisely the lepton charges / representations under the enhanced ew gauge group @xmath97 ( see @xcite for the quark sector ) .",
    "the protection of the @xmath98 couplings requires the equality @xmath99 between the @xmath100 and @xmath101 isospin quantum numbers of the charged leptons .",
    "hence , @xmath102 since the charge under @xmath103 is related to the sm hypercharge @xmath104 ( given by @xmath105 ) through : @xmath106 .",
    "now , if the yukawa term for charged leptons is issued from the minimal invariant operator with the form , @xmath107 where @xmath108 represents the higgs boson multiplet , then @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath111 representation could chosen differently at the price of generating the charged lepton masses by a non minimal operator , namely not as in eq.([eq : min ] ) ( an analog modification was proposed in @xcite for @xmath112 in order to solve the forward ",
    "backward anomaly of the bottom quark ) .",
    "+ for the neutrinos , one has @xmath113 and , similarly , the minimal operator for the yukawa term ( neutrino masses of dirac type are considered along this paper ) has the following invariant form , @xmath114 where @xmath115 or @xmath116 , respectively , with @xmath117 .",
    "in the following , the a , b , c sets of @xmath38 parameters have been considered .",
    "the important connection is that these @xmath38 values , determining the sm fermion wave function profiles , fix the strength of couplings between sm fermions and kk gauge bosons which dictates the amplitude of kk effects at lhc .",
    "indeed , the dependence of this strength ( eq.([sphysical ] ) ) on the @xmath38 parameters enters ( eq.([vmatrix ] ) ) via the @xmath118 matrix as well as the @xmath119 matrices which diagonalize fermion mass matrices .",

    "the @xmath6 process has been implemented as a user defined process in the pythia monte carlo generator version  6.205  @xcite . only the first three modes ( i.e. up to the second kk excitation of the photon and of the @xmath5 boson ) were taken into account , as well as the interference between them .",
    "the contributions of @xmath121 , @xmath122 , with @xmath123 , to the drell  yan cross section are not significant because the mass ( fermion couplings ) of @xmath121 , @xmath122 increases ( decreases ) as the kk  level @xmath7 gets higher  @xcite .",

    "even lower integrated luminosities would lead to a significant number of events .",
    "the difference of kk gauge boson widths between the three parameter sets originates from the difference in kk gauge couplings .",
    "it must be noticed also that there is a destructive interference between the sm and rs contributions which reduces the number of events , with respect to the pure drell  yan process , at invariant masses lower than the resonance level .",

    "the second resonance peak , due to the exchange of @xmath142 and @xmath143 excitations , appears around @xmath144 .",
    "its experimental detection would be characteristic of a tower of massive kk states , and would thus represent a strong indication for the existence of extra dimensions . together with a measurement of the @xmath145 mass , it would constitute a clear signature of the specific rs model with bulk matter .",
    "however , the amplitude for @xmath145 production is highly suppressed by the decrease of pdfs at large parton energies .      in order to study the detectability of such events at lhc , the expected performance of the atlas detector  @xcite has been used .",
    "this performance has been computed using a full simulation of the detector response  @xcite .",
    "the response to the particles out of the tracking acceptance ( i.e. with a pseudo - rapidity @xmath146 ) was not simulated .",
    "the events were then reconstructed in the official atlas reconstruction framework  @xcite .",
    "we concentrate here on the electron final state , which we have already studied in detail in the framework of other models  @xcite .",
    "the muon and tau lepton cases will be commented at the end of this section .",

    "the same selection as in  @xcite is used .",
    "first the electron ( positron ) candidates are reconstructed using the standard atlas electron identification : additionally to criteria on shower shape and energy leakage , one requires to have a good track quality . the absence of any additional track in a broad cone around the matched track is also required in order to reduce the qcd and tau backgrounds .",
    "only events with at least two electron candidates are selected .",
    "these two candidates are also required to be isolated in the calorimeter , which means that no more than 40  gev have been deposited in the calorimeter in a cone of radius @xmath148 around the electron direction .",
    "finally , the two electrons are required to be of opposite charge and back to back in the plane transverse to the beam , the absolute difference of azimuthal angles having to be greater than 2.9 radians .",
    "these criteria are aimed at selecting di ",
    "electron events and rejecting possible background events . after this selection ,",
    "drell  yan events , indistinguishable from @xmath149 events are expected to be the only physical background .",
    "some non  physical , reducible background could come from processes such as @xmath150 events in which the photon is misidentified as an electron and the @xmath151 decays into an electron .",
    "given their cross section and the rejecting power of the electron identification , they are assumed to be negligible .",

    "[ fig : eff ] .",
    "two curves are shown separately for @xmath152 and @xmath153 events because the events arising from @xmath152 fusion are slightly more boosted than those arising from @xmath153 fusion ( because of their pdfs ) .",
    "provided that one separates these two contributions , it has been shown that the selection efficiencies are model independent  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the efficiency is relatively flat as a function of the di  electron invariant mass .",

    "the results obtained here are thus dominated by the cross section .",
    "the value of the @xmath22 reach is shown as a function of the integrated luminosity on fig .",

    "one can see that the atlas discovery potential for the exchange of kk neutral gauge bosons is sizable , even for low integrated luminosities .",

    "the reach extends up to about 5.8  tev for the same model with 300  fb@xmath140 .    from the theoretical point of view , the cross sections for electron and muon productions are almost the same , as explained in section [ cross ] .",
    "experimentally , a study of the muon detection efficiency based on a fast simulation has showed that this efficiency should be comparable to the electron one .",
    "hence , one can estimate that including the statistics of the muon final state would be roughly equivalent to multiplying the integrated luminosity by a factor of 2 , so that the above reaches would be obtained with twice as less luminosity .",
    "the rates for electron and tau leptons are also similar .",
    "however , the detection of the tau lepton , which is unstable , is experimentally more difficult than the detection of the light stable leptons and would require a specific analysis . even if no such specific selection is performed , the leptonic decays of the di  tau final state would contribute to the high mass di  lepton spectrum .",

    "<S> such large couplings can be compatible with electroweak precision data on the @xmath0 coupling in the framework of the custodial @xmath1 symmetry recently proposed , for specific configurations of lepton localizations ( along the extra dimension ) . </S>",
    "<S> these configurations can simultaneously reproduce the correct lepton masses , while generating acceptably small flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) effects . </S>",
    "<S> this lhc phenomenological analysis is realistic in the sense that it is based on fermion localizations which reproduce all the quark / lepton masses plus mixing angles and respect fcnc constraints in both the hadron and lepton sectors .    </S>",
