    "in the last few years there has been considerable interest in looking for analytic solutions of the bohr hamiltonian which describes the collective motion in nuclei in terms of shape variables ( @xmath5 , @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "this was initiated with the introduction of the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite .",
    "this model present four different dynamical symmetries each one associated to a well defined nuclear shape .",
    "the model hamiltonian provides a natural way of going from a phase to another one by changing systematically few parameters and , consequently allows to study shape phase transitions .",
    "thus , the ibm phase diagram has been analyzed from different points of view @xcite .",
    "specially important are the critical points since in these situations structural changes occur rapidly and is difficult design appropriate theoretical models .",
    "recently , iachello has proposed a new dynamical symmetry for describing the critical point at the transition from spherical to deformed @xmath0-unstable shapes @xcite .",
    "this symmetry has been called e(5 ) and is expected to occur in nuclei in which the @xmath6 potential depends only on the @xmath5 variable , and it has a relatively flat shape in the @xmath5 variable . around this critical point of the phase transition the potential appearing in the bohr hamiltonian can be approximated by an infinite square well in the @xmath5 variable . in this case",
    "the bohr hamiltonian can be solved exactly in terms of bessel functions , and various quantitative predictions can be obtained for various spectroscopic properties ( ratios of the excitation energies and @xmath7 transitions ) , on the basis of which one can search for candidates for the e(5 ) symmetry among nuclei . lately , other two dynamical symmetries x(5 ) @xcite and y(5 ) @xcite to describe the critical point at the transition from spherical to axially deformed shapes and from axially deformed to triaxial shapes , respectively , have been proposed .",
    "the introduction of the e(5 ) symmetry renewed the interest in studying exactly solvable @xmath6 potentials .",
    "most efforts have concentrated on @xmath0-independent potentials , for which the most well - known example is the harmonic oscillator in the five - dimensional space @xcite and its extension which contains a term proportional to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "more recently two more exactly solvable @xmath0-unstable potentials have been discussed : the coulomb and the kratzer potentials @xcite . here",
    "again the latter potential is an extension of the former in the sense that it contains a term proportional to @xmath8 , which formally changes the @xmath9 variable , the analogue of the @xmath10 angular momentum of radial potentials in three spatial dimensions .",
    "this formal changing of @xmath9 introduces a minimum of the potentials at @xmath2 in both cases @xcite .",
    "the bound solutions of the harmonic oscillator and the coulomb potentials ( and their extensions ) are given in terms of generalized laguerre polynomials @xcite .",
    "similarly to the three - dimensional case , these examples , together with the infinite square well , practically exhaust those exactly solvable potentials that contain a @xmath8 term . here",
    "we propose another potential which has this property , and although it is not exactly solvable in the classical sense , it has a number of features that make it an ideal potential to be used in the bohr hamiltonian .",
    "this is the sextic oscillator , which belongs to the class of quasi - exactly solvable ( qes ) potentials @xcite .",
    "these potentials have the property that their solutions can be obtained in closed form for a number of energy eigenvalues , i.e. for the lowest few values of the @xmath11 principal quantum number , which are also the lowest in energy .",
    "this is clearly sufficient for potentials appearing in the bohr hamiltonian : it is rarely necessary to consider more than a few levels with the same angular momentum , and these can be obtained from the lowest few solutions of the sextic oscillator . furthermore , the sextic oscillator has a more flexible shape than other solvable potentials , as depending on its parameters , it can have a minimum at @xmath1 or at @xmath12 , and in addition , it can also have a local maximum at @xmath13 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sect .",
    "2 the bohr hamiltonian is revised together with its solutions for @xmath0-independent potentials . in sect .",
    "3 the lowest energy solutions of the bohr hamiltonian for the sextic oscillator potential are worked out .",
    "section 4 is devoted to show the simple use of the sextic oscillator as a flexible @xmath0-independent potential . finally , in sect .",
    "5 we present preliminary applications and discuss future extensions .",
    "let us first consider the bohr hamiltonian describing the collective motion of a deformed nucleus in the five - dimensional space determined by the @xmath14 euler angles ( @xmath15 ) and the intrinsic @xmath5 and @xmath0 variables is @xcite @xmath16 in what follows we assume that the potential in ( [ bohr ] ) depends only on @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath17 . for these @xmath0-independent potentials the wavefunctions can be separated into two parts @xmath18 which satisfy the following differential equations : @xmath19 @xmath20 here we have introduced @xmath21 and @xmath22 . note that the @xmath9 values determine the allowed angular momenta @xmath23 too @xcite . by setting @xmath24",
    "we obtain an equation which has the form of a radial schrdinger equation @xmath25 note that this is different from the eq .",
    "( 6 ) in @xcite in that it contains no linear derivative term due to the different definition of @xmath26 .",
    "this choice also implies that the factor corresponding to the @xmath5 volume element in the integration of functions of the type @xmath27 in ( [ bohrb ] ) has been transferred to the solutions of the type @xmath26 in ( [ bohrc ] ) .",
    "thus , in the integration of these no factor arising from the volume element has to be included .",
    "the complete solution of the problem implies the solution of eq .",
    "( [ bohgt ] ) too , this was solved in ref .",
    "the sextic oscillator with a centrifugal barrier is defined @xcite as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a non - negative integer .",
    "this potential is quasi - exactly solvable , which means that for any non - negative integer value of @xmath30 , @xmath31 of its solutions can be obtained in an algebraic way .",
    "the ( unnormalized ) solutions are written in the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a polynomial of order @xmath11 . obviously , normalizability requires @xmath34 , while @xmath35 reduces the problem to the exactly solvable harmonic oscillator .",
    "the simplest solutions are obtained for @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite . for @xmath36 only one nodeless",
    "( i.e. ground - state ) solution appears at @xmath38 , with the corresponding wavefunction being @xmath39 for @xmath37 two solutions appear , one nodeless , and another with one node for @xmath40 .",
    "these correspond to the ground - state and the first excited state , respectively , at energies @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 are the roots of the equation @xmath44 .",
    "the corresponding wavefunctions are @xmath45 and the @xmath46 and @xmath47 choice has to be made for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively @xcite .",
    "( note that @xmath34 and @xmath50 imply @xmath51 , so the polynomial part of ( [ sexwf1 ] ) is nodeless . )",
    "it has to be mentioned that the solutions for @xmath36 and @xmath37 belong to _ different _ sextic potentials if @xmath52 is the same , as the coefficient of the quadratic term is different then .",
    "we shall see , however , that with appropriate combinations of @xmath52 and @xmath30 it is possible to solve sextic potentials that differ only in the strength of the centrifugal term .",
    "the normalization of the wavefunctions can also be given in closed form .",
    "for this one has to evaluate integrals of the type @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the parabolic cylinder function and @xmath55 is one of the forms of the confluent hypergeometric function @xcite .",
    "larger values of @xmath30 can also be considered ( e.g. for @xmath56 three different solutions are obtained for the three roots of a cubic algebraic equation for @xmath57 ) , but @xmath36 and @xmath37 are sufficient for our purposes in this paper . a complete study including more solutions , explicit closed forms for the normalization factors and applications to actual nuclei is underway .",
    "in order to cast ( [ sexpot ] ) in a form similar to ( [ bohrc ] ) we have to write @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( remember that @xmath60 ) . in order to keep the quadratic term at a constant value ( once the @xmath61 parameters are fixed ) we also have to prescribe @xmath62 with this the sextic oscillator hamiltonian can be brought to the form of ( [ bohrb ] ) with @xmath63 being @xmath64 where the index @xmath65 is included to distinguish the potential for even / odd @xmath9 s which is slightly different as explained below . in eq .",
    "( [ upi ] ) @xmath66 are the constants obtained in eq .",
    "( [ abc ] ) for even / odd values of @xmath9 and we have introduced a constant @xmath67 for convenience as it will be discussed below .",
    "equation ( [ abc ] ) implies that increasing / decreasing @xmath30 in one unit has to come with decreasing / increasing @xmath9 in _ two _ units .",
    "thus , once the values of the @xmath68 parameters are fixed , the sequence of @xmath69 values @xmath70 correspond to solutions of eq .",
    "( [ upi ] ) with @xmath71 . in the same way",
    ", the sequence of @xmath69 values @xmath72 correspond to solutions of eq .",
    "( [ upi ] ) with @xmath73 .",
    "consequently , the potential for @xmath9-even and @xmath9-odd states is slightly different due to the fact that the coupling coefficient @xmath74 of the quadratic term is different in the two cases due to the choices for @xmath75 and @xmath76 that are necessary to separate the @xmath77 term in a uniform way .",
    "this situation can be handled using different strategies .",
    "one possibility is setting @xmath78 and considering @xmath79 , which minimizes the deviation of the quadratic terms compared to the quartic and sextic terms .",
    "another possibility is introducing a relative energy shift between the @xmath9-even and @xmath9-odd potentials by setting @xmath80 and @xmath81 such that the potential minima are at the same energy .",
    "we shall discuss this possibility after analyzing qualitatively the spectrum and the potential shapes .",
    "let us analyze the spectrum obtained in a simple case .",
    "taking @xmath37 we obtain , as explained in the preceding section , two solutions for @xmath82 ( one with no nodes , @xmath48 , and the other one with one node , @xmath49 ) . in the notation introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite the label @xmath83 is our @xmath84 .",
    "thus the two solutions of eq .",
    "( [ sexwf1 ] ) with @xmath85 are @xmath86 with @xmath48 and @xmath87 and correspond to @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively in ref .",
    "@xcite notation . inspecting the energy eigenvalues ,",
    "the corresponding energies are @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "the same potential is obtained by taking @xmath36 and @xmath92 . in this case",
    "we have a single solution , eq .",
    "( [ sexwf0 ] ) with @xmath93 , @xmath94 with no nodes and with energy @xmath95 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath96 in the notation of ref .",
    "a similar analysis can be performed for the solutions with odd @xmath9-values . for @xmath37",
    "there are two solutions with @xmath97 , eq .",
    "( [ sexwf1 ] ) with @xmath98 , which correspond to @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "the corresponding energy eigenvalues are @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "again the same potential is obtained for @xmath36 and @xmath103 . in this case",
    "there is a single solution with no nodes , eq .",
    "( [ sexwf0 ] ) with @xmath104 , which corresponds to @xmath105 and has an energy @xmath106 . in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] a schematic spectrum is shown with indication of the relevant quantum numbers . in fig .",
    "[ wfunctions ] the corresponding wavefunctions with the notation @xmath107 are presented .",
    "now we analyze the different potential shapes that can be produced by different election of parameters in eq .",
    "( [ upi ] ) . from ( [ upi ] ) we find that the shape of the potential @xmath108 depends on the sign of @xmath109 and @xmath110 , which set the coefficients of the quadratic and quartic terms .",
    "( the coefficient of the leading sextic term is always positive . )",
    "when @xmath111 and @xmath112 hold ( i.e. for @xmath113 ) , the potential has a minimum at @xmath1 and it increases monotonously with @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath114 , irrespective of the sign of @xmath110 ( i.e. for @xmath115 ) , a minimum appears for @xmath2 , while for @xmath111 and @xmath116 ( i.e. for @xmath117 ) , first a maximum appears and then a minimum as @xmath5 increases . in all three cases the exact location of the extremal point(s ) can be obtained from the real and positive solutions of @xmath118\\ .",
    "\\label{beta0}\\ ] ]    due to the relatively small difference in @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the @xmath9-even and @xmath9-odd potentials have the same types of extrema at about the same @xmath5 , except for some peculiar combinations of @xmath119 and @xmath110 .",
    "assuming that there are no complications of this kind , we can now return to the question of renormalizing the minima of the @xmath9-even and @xmath9-odd potentials . for @xmath113 , @xmath120",
    "the minima of the two potentials will be @xmath80 and @xmath81 at @xmath1 , so they coincide if @xmath121 holds . for @xmath122 we can equate the minima of @xmath123 and @xmath124 if we set @xmath125 and @xmath126   + a^2[(\\beta^+_0)^6 -(\\beta^-_0)^6]\\ , \\label{u0}\\ ] ] where the @xmath127 are obtained from ( [ beta0 ] ) with the choice of the `` + '' sign . with this the two potentials",
    "have their minima at the same energy , but they take on different values at the origin .",
    "illustrations of the possible potential shapes are displayed in fig .",
    "[ potentials ] .",
    "obviously , @xmath81 in ( [ beta0 ] ) also has to be added to the energies of the @xmath9-odd potential .",
    "[ energies ] show the relative position of the energy levels @xmath128 as either @xmath119 or @xmath110 is varied and the other parameter is kept at a fixed value .",
    "the electric quadrupole transition rates can also be determined analytically by calculating the matrix elements of the transition operator @xcite @xmath129\\ . \\label{te2}\\ ] ] the radial integrals that appear in the @xmath5 variable in the matrix elements of @xmath130 can again be determined using ( [ sexintd ] ) . in order to obtain the _ total _ matrix elements , one has to calculate also the components depending on @xmath0 and the euler angles @xmath14 .",
    "this can be done following the techniques described in ref .",
    "these parts introduce certain selection rules not only for the angular momenta , but also for @xmath9 .",
    "in order to compare the main characteristics of the sextic oscillator as a @xmath0-unstable potential with those of other potentials of this kind , we present calculations for a particular value of the parameters , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "these numbers were chosen such that the resulting energy spectrum approximates that of the @xmath4ba nucleus , the first candidate for e(5 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "we stress that our aim is not to reproduce the experimental data , rather to get a qualitative picture about the general performance of the model .",
    "the potentials @xmath133 are displayed in the middle panel of fig . [ potentials ] , while the energy eigenvalues are shown in fig .",
    "[ 134ba ] , together with the corresponding experimental energy levels .",
    "[ 134ba ] also shows the calculated and the experimental @xmath7 values for transitions between the energy levels .",
    "note that electric quadrupole transitions which change @xmath9 with more than one unit are zero if we use the transition operator ( [ te2 ] ) , but finite @xmath7 strengths can be obtained if we apply terms of the next order ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in table [ numbers ] we summarize the ratio of the most important energy eigenvalues and those of the most characteristic @xmath7 transition rates obtained from the sextic oscillator with parameters @xmath131 , @xmath132 , the infinite square well potential @xcite and the numerically solved @xmath3 potential @xcite together with the corresponding experimental values for @xmath4ba , whenever available .",
    "it is seen that the energy ratios corresponding to the e(5 ) symmetry systematically fall between the values of the @xmath3 potential and the sextic oscillator .",
    "the situation is less obvious for the ratio of the @xmath7 values : here the sextic oscillator and the infinite square well seem to yield similar ratios , while the numbers obtained from the @xmath3 potential are systematically higher .",
    "this might be due to the fact that the sextic oscillator potential goes to infinity steeper than the @xmath3 potential , so the asymptotic behaviour of its wavefunctions can be closer to that of the wavefunctions of the infinite square well . comparing the results with the experimental data for @xmath4ba we can conclude that , at least in this case , the sextic oscillator allows a better approximation than the other essentially parameter - free potentials . we expect that this conclusion will be general due to the flexible nature of the sextic potential whose shape is governed by two parameters .",
    "in fact this potential can be used not just at the critical point but it can be useful to model the full shape phase transition from spherical to deformed @xmath134unstable nuclei by changing the parameters @xmath119 and @xmath110 .    before closing , we mention some aspects of the sextic oscillator that might give further help in the analysis of nuclei near critical points .",
    "first we note that with @xmath56 in ( [ sexpot ] ) the analysis can be extended to further states , such as @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "second , the potential shape which contains both a local maximum and a minimum at @xmath2 might be useful in the description of nuclei with the so - called x(5 ) symmetry , which is thought to occur in the shape phase transition between the spherical and the axially deformed domain @xcite .",
    "third , there are further quasi - exactly solvable potentials both with confining and non - confining nature @xcite , which can also be considered in the bohr hamiltonian ."
