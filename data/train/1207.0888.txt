    "such x - shaped structure has been noted earlier for other boxy / peanut bulges : ( e.g. whitmore & bell ( 1988 ) ) .    we have recently completed the abundances and radial velocity galactic origins survey ( argos ) which is a spectroscopic survey of 28,000 stars , mostly clump giants , in 28 fields of the galactic bulge and nearby disk .",
    "the argos survey provides a clean sample of bulge giants with distances , radial velocities and metallicities . as part of this survey , we have data for about 3000 stars in three two - degree fields along the minor axis , at @xmath7 = @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "the objectives of this paper are ( 1 ) to measure the metallicity range of the stars that show the split red clump near the minor axis of the bulge , ( 2 ) to determine whether the split red clump has an associated kinematic signature , and ( 3 ) to interpret these results in the context of an evolutionary n - body model .",

    "the normalised units on the vertical axis are arbitrary.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the left panels of figure [ fig : fig8 ] show the velocity distributions for the bright ( solid curve ) and faint ( broken curve ) groups in the two observed latitude samples .",
    "the velocity distributions are presented as generalised histograms , in which each stellar velocity is represented by a gaussian with @xmath131 km s@xmath35  centered at its observed velocity ; this avoids binning and suppresses high frequency noise in the distribution .",
    "this representation does not affect the mean velocities given below , which are calculated directly from the data : it is intended to make the form of the distribution more clear visually .",
    "the numbers of stars in each subsample are shown in the panels .",
    "the right panels show the corresponding velocity distributions for the model .",
    "we recall that the model velocities were scaled so that the velocity dispersion of the model for the m0m5 sample agrees with the observed dispersion ( @xmath132 km s@xmath35 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the high latitude sample ( @xmath133 km s@xmath35 ) is also similar to that of the model ( @xmath134 km s@xmath35 ) , with no significant difference in dispersion between the bright and faint groups . for the low latitude field , the velocity offsets between bright and faint groups are @xmath135 km s@xmath35  for the data and @xmath136 km s@xmath35  for the model . for the high latitude fields , the offsets are @xmath137 km s@xmath35   for the data and @xmath138 km s@xmath35  for the model .",
    "the conclusion from this figure is that the velocity offsets between the near and far groups of the split clump are similar within the uncertainties for the data and model in both of the latitude regions .",
    "these velocity offsets come mainly from streaming motions within the bar / bulge .",
    "the velocity offsets in the model are sensitive to the bar orientation relative to the sun - center line ; the velocity offsets agree with the observed offsets , within the errors , for a bar angle of @xmath5 .    in this section ,",
    "we have considered only the kinematics of stars in argos fields on the minor axis .",
    "a detailed comparison of the kinematics for the model and the data for the other argos fields , as shown in figure 1 , will be presented in a separate paper ( ness et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "the argos survey provides a large sample of bulge stars with accurate abundances and radial velocities , relatively free of contamination from foreground and background stars . in this paper",
    "we used argos stars near the minor axis of the bulge to investigate the properties of the split red clump .",
    "the split in the red clump magnitude distribution is seen very clearly in the higher latitude fields ( @xmath139 to @xmath61 ) near the minor axis , for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath2 .",
    "the more metal - poor red clump stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath140 ) in the same regions of the bulge do not show the split , and it is almost absent at all metallicities for our m0m5 field ( @xmath141 to @xmath142 ) .",
    "we compared the structure and kinematics of the argos stars with an n - body model of a bulge . in the model",
    ", the boxy / peanut bulge grew through the bar - forming and bar - buckling instability of a disk of stars .",
    "although the model was not constructed to fit the galactic bulge , it is a good representation .",
    "the orbital structure of the boxy / peanut bulge leads to the central depression in its peanut - shaped density distribution : see athanassoula ( 2005 ) .",
    "the central depression in turn leads to a split bimodal structure along the line of sight at higher latitudes which closely resembles the split observed in the argos stars and in the saito et al .",
    "( 2011 ) data . at low latitude ,",
    "the kinematics of the bulge stars in the bright and faint groups of the split red clump are also similar to those for the corresponding stars in the model .    in projection , the density distribution would show an x - shaped structure , particularly after unsharp masking : see whitmore & bell ( 1988 ) , athanassoula ( 2005 ) and bureau et al .",
    "it seems likely that the split red clump seen in the galactic bulge is a generic feature of boxy / peanut bulges which grew from disks .",
    "we also conclude that the disk from which the bar / bulge formed would have had relatively few stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath4 .",
