    "the thermal low-@xmath6 photon yield is furthermore found to approximately scale with the fireball lifetime , which reiterates the importance of the later hadronic stages ( on the other hand , the sensitivity to transverse flow effects is small ) .",
    "we also note that baryon - induced effects , which enter through a medium modified @xmath4 spectral function  @xcite carried to the photon point and which dominate the contribution labeled  hg \" at the depicted momenta , are appreciable ( at the 30 - 60% level in the range @xmath8  gev ) . besides resonance decays ( e.g. , @xmath166 ) , these include bremsstrahlung from @xmath10-@xmath56 , @xmath56-@xmath56 , and @xmath56-@xmath167 interactions ( as following from @xmath168 and @xmath169 excitations in the pion cloud of the @xmath4-meson ) , which have been constrained by ( the inverse process of ) photoabsorption on the nucleon and nuclei  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , similar contributions were claimed to be smaller .",
    "another source of soft direct photons in heavy - ion collisions that we would like to study here is ( nonthermal ) bremsstrahlung emission due to coherent radiation off the protons within the incoming nuclei  @xcite . in the long - wave length limit , @xmath170 ( @xmath26 : photon 3-momentum , @xmath171  fm : typical system size ) ,",
    "phase interferences are suppressed and the radiation can be assessed via the rapidity shift that the protons undergo from the initial nuclei to the finally observed distribution . including both target and projectile , and for central collisions , one finds the following form of the photon spectrum  @xcite , @xmath172 + \\left.\\frac{dn}{dy}\\right|_t \\frac{v { \\rm sin\\theta}}{1-v { \\rm cos\\theta}}\\right\\}\\right|^2 \\label{co_equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath173 is the beam velocity , @xmath174 is the final - state ( fs ) proton rapidity , and @xmath175 are the pertinent fs rapidity distributions for projectile and target nuclei , respectively .",

    "even with the extreme assumption of @xmath177-function like proton rapidity distributions at @xmath178 ( full stopping ) , the coherent emission yield falls significantly short of the data .",
    "we thus conclude that this mechanism can not be at the origin of the observed enhancement over previous predictions  @xcite .",
    "in this article we have revisited the problem of soft photon production from hadronic matter which has recently received renewed interest by the observation of a large excess by the wa98 collaboration in central @xmath7-@xmath7 collisions at the cern - sps .",
    "earlier predictions using two - body mesonic and baryon - induced thermal photon production significantly underestimated these data .",

    "based on a @xmath179-gauged meson - exchange model for elastic @xmath10-@xmath10 and @xmath10-@xmath11 scattering ( in born approximation ) , our main improvement over previous calculations consists of a full numerical treatment of the collision integral which goes beyond the commonly employed soft - photon approximation and allows for the inclusion of final - state bose enhancement factors .",
    "we have explicitly constructed pertinent contact interactions to preserve electromagnetic gauge invariance of the underlying bremsstrahlung amplitude .",
    "the combined effect of the two improvements amounts to an increase of the thermal @xmath10-@xmath10 bremsstrahlung rate by up to a factor of 2 at low photon energies ( @xmath180  gev ) , while @xmath10-@xmath11 scattering adds another @xmath3720% ( essentially reflecting the @xmath11/@xmath10 ratio in the hadronic gas ) . as a consequence ,",
    "meson - meson bremsstrahlung becomes the dominant thermal photon source at low energies .",
    "when combined with previous rate calculations , the convolution over a standard thermal fireball evolution reduces previously found discrepancies with the low - momentum wa98 data .",
    "this comparison , however , does not include the lpm effect , which we have estimated to suppress the soft emission rate by up to several tens of percent .",
    "we have furthermore shown that the bremsstrahlung rates are rather insensitive to medium effects on the `` @xmath3''-meson in form of a reduced mass , due to the fact that the elastic @xmath10-@xmath10 cross section is dominated by ( @xmath17-channel ) @xmath4 exchange .",
    "we finally studied the possibility of coherent bremsstrahlung induced by rapidity shifts of the incoming projectile and target protons . when using realistic final - state distributions , we have found this contribution to be essentially negligible .    while our investigations suggest that thermal emission from hadronic matter might be at the origin of the low-@xmath6 wa98 enhancement , more work is required to quantify the theoretical estimates , e.g.  by merging medium effects on the @xmath4-meson ( as implicit in rate estimates using in - medium spectral functions ) with the newly computed bremsstrahlung rates , as well as by explicit implementations of the lpm effect .",
