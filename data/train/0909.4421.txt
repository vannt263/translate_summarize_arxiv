    "the recent experimental results at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , suggesting the creation of a nearly perfect fluid @xcite , have fueled interest in the study of bulk properties of strongly interacting matter ( qcd ) .",
    "heavy ion experiments at different beam energies try to map out the qcd phase diagram , especially the region where one expects a phase transition from a confined gas of hadrons to a deconfined state of quarks and gluons ( qgp ) @xcite . to relate any experimental observables to the properties of the matter produced in heavy ion collisions , a profound understanding of the thermodynamics of qcd has to be obtained and integrated in model simulations of these collisions .",
    "+ one can define two different phase transitions , the first being the chiral phase transition associated with chiral symmetry restoration in the vanishing quark mass limit , where the chiral condensate serves as a well defined order parameter . in the limit of heavy quarks , a deconfinement phase transition with the polyakov loop as order parameter ,",
    "is assumed .",
    "physical quarks however have intermediate masses and one would expect that at least the deconfinement order parameter is not so well defined anymore .",
    "there could even be some mixing of the two order parameters , accounting for some lattice qcd observation that deconfinement and chiral restoration occur at the same temperature ( at least at @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "+ such lattice calculations at finite temperature are an important tool for the investigation of the qcd phase diagram . for the thermodynamics of the pure gauge theory high accuracy data",
    "is available @xcite , and the equation of state ( eos ) of strongly interacting matter at vanishing chemical potential is reasonably well understood @xcite . here",
    "lattice predicts a rapid crossover for the deconfining and chiral phase transitions .",
    "+ at finite baryo - chemical potential , lattice calculations suffer from the so called sign problem .",
    "there are several different approaches to obtain results at finite @xmath2 @xcite , but yet no clear picture , especially about the existence and location of a possible critical end point , has emerged . + recent considerations based on connecting the large @xmath3 limit with real - word qcd draw an even more exotic picture of the phase diagram , where the critical temperatures of the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions disconnect and depart in the region of high net baryon densities @xcite .",
    "+ in our approach we combine , in a single model , a well - established flavor - su(3 ) hadronic model with a quark - gluon description of the highly excited matter .",
    "this allows us to study the chiral - symmetry and confinement - deconfinement phase structure of the strongly interacting matter at high temperatures and densities .",
    "in addition we obtain an equation of state of hadronic and quark matter that is applicable over a wide range of thermodynamical conditions and that can therefore be used in heavy - ion simulations with very different beam energies .",
    "in our approach we derive the eos of hot and dense nuclear matter using a single model for the hadronic and quark phase .",
    "the model includes the correct asymptotic degrees of freedom , namely a free gas of quarks and gluons at infinite temperature , and a gas of hadrons having the correct vacuum properties at vanishing temperature .",
    "the model also predicts the structure of finite nuclei , nuclear and neutron matter properties and a first order liquid - vapor phase transition .",
    "the two phase transitions that are expected from qcd , the chiral and deconfinement transitions , are also included in a consistent manner .",
    "+ in the following we will show how we describe the different phases of qcd and how we combine them in a single model .",
    "+ we describe the hadronic part of the eos , using a flavor - su(3 ) model which is an extension of a non - linear representation of a sigma - omega model including the pseudo - scalar and vector octets of mesons and the baryonic octet and decuplet ( for a detailed discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "the lagrangian density of the model in mean field approximations reads : @xmath4 where besides the kinetic energy term for hadrons , the terms :    @xmath5\\psi_i,&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath6    represent the interactions between baryons and vector and scalar mesons , the self - interactions of scalar and vector mesons , and an explicitly chiral symmetry breaking term .",
    "the index @xmath7 denotes the baryon octet and decuplet . here , the mesonic condensates ( determined in mean - field approximation ) included are the vector - isoscalars @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and the scalar - isoscalars @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( strange quark - antiquark state ) . assuming isospin symmetric matter",

    "[ formel1 ] .",
    "the last four terms of ( [ formel1 ] ) were introduced to model the qcd trace anomaly @xcite , where the dilaton field @xmath13 can be identified with the gluon condensate .",
    "the effective masses of the baryons ( of the octet ) are generated by the scalar mesons except for an explicit mass term ( @xmath14 mev ) : @xmath15 while , for simplicity and in order to reduce the number of free parameters , the masses of the decuplet baryons are kept at their vacuum expectation values . with the increase of temperature / density , the @xmath10 field ( non - strange chiral condensate ) decreases its value , causing the effective masses of the particles to decrease towards chiral symmetry restoration . the coupling constants for the baryons @xcite are chosen to reproduce the vacuum masses of the baryons , nuclear saturation properties and asymmetry energy as well as the @xmath16-hyperon potentials .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of the scalar mesons are constrained by reproducing the pion and kaon decay constants .",
    "+ the extension of the hadronic su(3 ) model to quark degrees of freedom is constructed in analogy to the pnjl model @xcite .",
    "the sigma model uses the polyakov loop @xmath17 as the order parameter for deconfinement .",
    "@xmath17 is defined via @xmath18tr@xmath19 $ ] , where @xmath20 is the temporal component of the su(3 ) gauge field .",
    "one should note that one must distinguish @xmath17 , and its conjugate @xmath21 at finite baryon densities @xcite , as they couple differently to the quarks , respective antiquarks .",
    "+ in our approach the effective masses of the quarks are generated by the scalar mesons except for a small explicit mass term ( @xmath22 mev and @xmath23 mev for the strange quark ) : @xmath24 with values of @xmath25 . at present",
    "we do not consider any possible quark - vectormeson couplings .    a coupling of the quarks to the polyakov loop",
    "is introduced in the thermal energy of the quarks .",
    "their thermal contribution to the grand canonical potential @xmath26 , can then be written as : @xmath27 and @xmath28    the sums run over all quark flavors , where @xmath29 is the corresponding degeneracy factor , @xmath30 the energy and @xmath31 the chemical potential of the quark . +",

    "the effective potential @xmath37 which controls the dynamics of the polyakov - loop will be discussed in the following . in our approach",
    "we adopt the ansatz proposed in @xcite : @xmath38\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath39 , @xmath40 . + this choice of effective potential satisfies the @xmath41 center symmetry of the pure gauge lagrangian . in the confined phase",
    ", @xmath42 has an absolute minimum at @xmath43 , while above the critical temperature @xmath44 ( for pure gauge @xmath45 mev ) its minimum is shifted to finite values of @xmath17 .",
    "the logarithmic term appears from the haar measure of the group integration with respect to the su(3 ) polyakov loop matrix .",
    "the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 are fixed , as in @xcite , by demanding a first order phase transition in the pure gauge sector at @xmath48 mev , and that the stefan - boltzmann limit is reached for @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath44 remains a free parameter to adjust the actual critical temperature , of both phase transitions , when both , quarks and hadrons , couple to the scalar fields .",
    "+ as has been mentioned above , the lagrangian of the chiral model contains dilaton terms to model the scale anomaly .",
    "these terms constrain the chiral condensate , if the dilaton is frozen at its ground state value @xmath50 . on the other hand , as deconfinement",
    "is realized , the expectation value of the chiral condensate should vanish at some point . on account of this",
    "we will couple the polyakov loop to the dilaton in the following way : @xmath51    hence , when the value of the polyakov loop approaches unity , the dilaton field will slowly vanish and allow the chiral condensate to also approach zero .",
    "+ until now all hadrons are still present in the deconfined and chirally restored phase . since we expect them to disappear , at least at some point above @xmath52 , we have to include a mechanism that effectively suppresses the hadronic degrees of freedom , when deconfinement is achieved .",
    "+ in previous calculations baryons were suppressed by introducing a large baryon mass shift for non - vanishing @xmath17 @xcite .    in the following the suppression mechanism",
    "will be provided by excluded volume effects .",
    "it is well known that hadrons are no point - like particles , but have a finite volume . including effects of finite - volume particles , in a thermodynamic model for hadronic matter ,",
    "was proposed some time ago @xcite .",
    "we will use an ansatz similar to that used in @xcite , but modify it to also treat the point like quark degrees of freedom consistently .",
    "+    if one introduces a particle of radius @xmath53 into a gas of the same particles , then the volume excluded is not just the simple spherical volume , but one - half times the volume of a sphere with radius @xmath54 : @xmath55 it is easy to understand that if all other particles also have a radius @xmath53 then the excluded volume is much bigger than just the volume of a single particle .",
    "+ we expect the volume of a meson to be smaller than of a baryon we have to introduce the quantity @xmath56 which is the volume excluded of a particle of species @xmath7 . since we only distinguish between hadronic baryons , mesons and quarks .",
    "consequently @xmath56 can only assume three values : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a number larger than one . in our calculations",
    "we assumed it to be @xmath59 , which would mean that the radius @xmath53 of a meson is half that of a baryon .",
    "note that we neglect any possible lorentz contraction effects on the excluded volumes as introduced in @xcite .",
    "the modified chemical potential @xmath60 which is connected to the real chemical potential @xmath31 , of the @xmath7-th particle species , is obtained by the following relation : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the sum over all partial pressures .",
    "all thermodynamic quantities can then be calculated with respect to the temperature @xmath63 and the new chemical potentials @xmath60 .",
    "to be thermodynamically consistent , all densities ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) have to be multiplied by a volume correction factor @xmath67 , which is the ratio of the total volume @xmath68 and the reduced volume @xmath69 , not being occupied , : @xmath70    the actual densities then are : @xmath71    note that in this configuration the chemical potentials of the hadrons are decreased by the quarks , but not vice versa . in other words as the quarks start appearing they effectively suppress the hadrons by changing their chemical potential , while the quarks are only affected through the volume correction factor @xmath67 .",
    "+ our implementation of finite - volume corrections as outlined above is a simple approach with as few parameters as possible and can be improved upon in various ways . for one ,",
    "hadrons differ in size .",
    "the size of a hadron could even be density or temperature dependent @xcite .",
    "in addition , the excluded - volume parameter of a particle does also depend on the density of the system ( at dense packing a particle excludes effectively less volume ) .",
    "however , one should regard the variables @xmath72 and @xmath58 as effective parameters for capturing the qualitative effect of an excluded volume correction , which suppresses the hadrons in the quark phase . +",
    "in this paper we will concentrate on the properties of the model at vanishing chemical potential . here",
    "different lattice calculations suggest a crossover from the hadronic to the quark phase .",
    "different lattice groups obtain different results for the phase transition temperature ranging from @xmath73 mev to @xmath74 mev @xcite . for all following results we set @xmath44 , the free parameter of the polyakov - potential , to @xmath75 mev and the excluded volume parameter @xmath76 .",
    "this leads to a critical temperature of @xmath77 mev ( @xmath52 is defined as the temperature with the largest change in the order parameters as a function of the temperature ) . + the lattice data referred to in the following sections are taken from the hotqcd collaboration @xcite . here",
    "different actions ( p4 , asqtad ) and lattice spacings ( @xmath78 ) were compared .",
    "note that the transition region extracted from the lattice data lies between @xmath79 and @xmath80 mev .",
    "[ mu0sig ] shows the temperature dependence for the order parameters of both , the deconfinement ( @xmath17 ) , and chiral ( @xmath10 ) phase transition , extracted from our model and compared to lattice data .",
    "both order parameters change smoothly with temperature .",
    "the critical temperature is found to be equal for both phase transitions .",
    "note that the value of the chiral condensate @xmath10 only very slowly approaches zero .",
    "this originates from the dilaton contribution to the scalar potential in this model , which includes a repulsive term for small values of @xmath10 .",
    "[ mu0dens ] shows the total densities of quarks plus antiquarks ( black solid line ) , mesons ( green dotted line ) and baryons plus antibaryons ( dashed red line ) . below",
    "the critical temperature hadrons are the dominant degree of freedom .",
    "when the quark number increases around @xmath52 , they begin to suppress the hadrons .",
    "it is remarkable that the hadrons are still present , and not negligible , up to about @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "especially the mesons contribute strongly to all thermodynamic quantities , since they are quite less suppressed than the baryons ( @xmath82 ) . above @xmath83",
    "the hadrons are effectively squeezed out of the system by the presence of the quarks .    to emphasize this change in degrees of freedom , fig .",
    "[ mu0mix ] shows the fraction of the total energy density which stems from the quarks and gluons ( more precisely the polyakov potential ) .",
    "as expected for a crossover both degrees of freedom ( hadrons and quarks ) are present in the temperature range from @xmath84 . around @xmath52",
    "the fraction of the energy density , due to quarks and gluons increases rapidly .",
    "it converges to unity at around 2 times @xmath52 .",
    "let us now take a closer look at different thermodynamic quantities .",
    "fig [ mu0et4 ] displays the energy density ( black curve ) and three times the pressure ( red dashed curve ) , both over @xmath85 compared to lattice data @xcite . in the limit of infinite temperature , both quantities should converge to the stefan - boltzmann limit of an ideal gas of quarks and gluons .",
    "this limit is indicated as a green dashed line .",
    "the strong increase in energy density around @xmath52 reflects the rapid change of the relevant degrees of freedom . at three times",
    "the critical temperature the energy density is slowly converging to the stefan - boltzmann limit , while the pressure is converging even slower as it was also observed in pnjl calculations @xcite . at temperatures below @xmath52",
    "our calculation gives larger values for the pressure and the energy density , which is not surprising as the correct description of the hadron contribution is problematic in the case of lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "+    around @xmath86 one can observe a slight dip in the energy density .",
    "this dip is connected to the correction factor @xmath67 of the excluded volume corrections .",
    "as has been shown above , the hadronic contribution to the densities disappears only at two time @xmath52 and therefore they still exclude some portion of the volume for the quarks .",
    "the dip therefore indicates the disappearance of volume correction factors for the quark phase .    in the high temperature limit , where only the quarks ( and gluons ) remain in the system the energy density and pressure both",
    "slightly exceed the data from lattice calculations .",
    "figure [ mu0e3p ] displays the difference of the energy density and three times the pressure over @xmath85 ( black solid line ) .",
    "this quantity is also referred to as the interaction measure in lattice calculations . in the stefan - boltzmann limit it is @xmath87 , while it shows a peak slightly above @xmath52 .",
    "the height of the peak in our model is comparable to the lower bound from lattice studies @xcite , while its value at large @xmath63 is a little bit above that from lattice calculations , because chiral restoration is not fully achieved in our model . to point out the effect of the volume correction factor on this quantity , figure [ mu0e3p ] also displays the uncorrected interaction measure @xmath88 as a grey dashed line .",
    "an important property of a hot and dense nuclear medium is the speed of sound ( @xmath89 ) : @xmath90 it is not only closely related to expansion dynamics but also controls the way perturbations ( sound- and shock - waves ) travel through the fireball @xcite .",
    "fig [ mu0cs2 ] shows the speed of sound squared as a function of temperature . as the temperature increases towards @xmath52 one",
    "can clearly observe a softening of the eos due to the crossover . at very high temperature",
    "the speed of sound again converges toward its ideal gas limit of @xmath91 .",
    "the dip above @xmath52 is again related to the excluded volume corrections .",
    "note that even though the change of degrees of freedom from hadrons to quarks proceeds as a crossover , there is still a substantial softening ( i.e. @xmath92 goes down to @xmath93 ) !",
    "lattice results at finite chemical potentials ( @xmath94 ) are often obtained as taylor expansion of the thermodynamic quantities in the parameter @xmath95 around zero chemical potential and @xmath96 .",
    "we perform the same expansion in the present model to compare with lattice results . in the taylor expansion of the pressure @xmath97 with respect to @xmath98 , the coefficients @xmath99",
    "follow from : @xmath100    because the derivatives of the pressure with respect to @xmath101 are difficult to be obtained directly from a mean field approach ( see @xcite ) , we calculate the pressure as function of @xmath63 and @xmath102 explicitly and then extract the derivatives around @xmath103 .",
    "+ the results for the second moment are shown in fig [ mu0susz ] and compared to lattice calculations taken from @xcite .",
    "the second order coefficient @xmath104 , exhibits an enhancement below @xmath52 , due to the hadronic contributions and a minimum just above @xmath52 .",
    "this is not observed in lattice calculations , because the origin of this dip is the presence of the additional hadronic degrees of freedom and the excluded volume effects in the hadronic part of the model .",
    "thus it is not surprising to see a discrepancy to the lattice data .",
    "+ the fourth order coefficient @xmath105 is shown in fig [ mu0suszc4 ] . as expected ,",
    "a peak is observed around @xmath52 .",
    "again the absolute height of the peak exceeds that from lattice calculations .",
    "this , again , stems from the fact that our model includes many hadronic degrees of freedom around @xmath52 .",
    "the minimum above @xmath52 is also visible in the forth order coefficient .",
    "+ note that the quark number susceptibility is also closely related to the taylor coefficients and therefore shows a clear maximum at @xmath52 . + as our model does not sustain the difficulties of lattice calculations , when going to finite net baryon densities , it is straight forward to extend our investigations to finite chemical potentials ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "these calculations at finite densities are in progress and will be subject of future publications . +",
    "we present a novel approach for modeling an eos that respects the symmetries underlying qcd , and includes the correct asymptotic degrees of freedom , i.e. quarks and gluons at high temperature and hadrons in the low - temperature limit .",
    "we achieve this by including quarks degrees of freedom and the thermal contribution of the polyakov loop in a hadronic chiral sigma - omega model .",
    "the hadrons are suppressed at high densities by excluded volume corrections .",
    "nevertheless , we observe a substantial hadronic contribution to the eos up to temperatures of 2 times @xmath52 .",
    "+ we can show that the properties of the eos are in qualitative agreement with lattice data at @xmath107 .",
    "various quantities , like the pressure and energy density , are in good agreement with lattice data .",
    "deviations from lattice results , for example the taylor coefficients of the expansion in @xmath95 , can be explained by the hadronic contributions and volume corrections . in spite of a continuous phase transition",
    ", we obtain a considerably smaller value for the speed of sound around @xmath52 ( @xmath108 ) when compared to lattice calculations @xcite .",

    "<S> we construct an effective model for the qcd equation of state , taking into account chiral symmetry restoration as well as the deconfinement phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the correct asymptotic degrees of freedom at the high and low temperature limits are included ( quarks @xmath0 hadrons ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model shows a rapid crossover for both order parameters , as is expected from lattice calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we then investigate the thermodynamic properties of the model at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> all thermodynamic quantities are in qualitative agreement with lattice data , while apparent quantitative differences can be attributed to hadronic contributions and excluded volume corrections . </S>"
