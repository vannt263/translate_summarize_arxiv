    "this is not the case , however , because the nto already takes into account most of the effect .",
    "in fact , we have compared the reaction cross sections between nto and fb at several incident energies , and found that the difference between them is small even at low energy : for example , at the incident energy of 40 @xmath20mev , the @xmath76 value of @xmath7c+@xmath2c is 1519 mb for nto and 1525 mb for fb , whereas it is only 1425 mb for the folding model which uses eq .",

    "[ rcs.22c-12c ] our prediction of the reaction cross section of @xmath5c+@xmath2c as a function of the incident energy . as the reaction cross section increases for the increasing radius of the projectile and no information on the mass of @xmath5c is available , we plot two cases obtained using the densities which correspond to the two extremes in table  [ c22-scat.length ] , namely @xmath77 and 10.9 mev .",

    "based on the above expression , the reaction radius of @xmath5c may be estimated by @xmath86 using the reaction cross sections calculated at high energy together with @xmath87 leads to the estimation that the reaction radius of @xmath5c , @xmath88 , is about 4.41 fm .",
    "multiplying it by @xmath89 , we obtain 3.41 fm for the rms reaction radius of @xmath5c , which is smaller than the rms matter radii listed in table  [ c22-scat.length ] . for lighter stable nuclei , typically @xmath90 ,",
    "the rms reaction radii are usually smaller than the rms matter radii @xcite .",
    "since light nuclei have no sharp surface , the reaction occurs inside compared to heavier nuclei .",
    "actually , for the data of incident energies higher than @xmath91 @xmath20mev , @xmath92 systematically deviates from the empirically deduced values of the rms matter radius for nuclei having mass number less than about 50 , while it almost completely agrees with the deduced values for @xmath93 .",
    "this tendency suggests a significant change of the nuclear matter distribution from a rectangular one for @xmath94 , which is consistent with the behavior of the empirical charge distribution .",
