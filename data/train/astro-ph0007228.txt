    "recent observational efforts to detect high - redshift ( @xmath3 ) supernovae ( sne ) have demonstrated their value as cosmological probes . the discovery and systematic study of faint , distant type ia supernovae ( sneia ) has led to renewed progress in constraining the cosmic expansion history @xcite .",
    "two independent corrected hubble diagrams based on sneia discovered via the supernovae cosmology project ( perlmutter et  al .  1999 ) and the high - redshift supernovae search team ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ) yield a trend that strongly excludes the hitherto popular einstein de sitter universe and , for a spatially flat inflationary universe consistent with recent microwave background measurements @xcite , suggests a significant non - zero cosmological constant , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "such studies have now identified over 100 @xmath5 sneia , and , using controlled subsets of these sneia samples , the first constraints are now emerging on the rate of their occurrence ( pain et al .  1996 , 2000a ) .",
    "the observational determination of these rates is also important in many cosmological applications , for example as a diagnostic of the cosmic star formation history ( sfh ) and metal enrichment at high-@xmath3 .",
    "sne are independent of some of the biases associated with traditional tests based on flux - limited galaxy samples .",
    "such biases are increasingly of concern given the steep luminosity functions now being witnessed for star - forming galaxies at all redshifts @xcite and , though there remain uncertainties in the correct treatment of dust in high-@xmath3 type ii supernovae ( sneii ) , they offer an alternative approach to studying the cosmic sfh .",
    "sneii are caused by the catastrophic core collapse of massive ( @xmath6 ) stars and , unlike sneia , represent a direct probe of the massive sfh due to their short progenitor lifetimes  the evolution of the sneii rate should closely match that of the cosmic sfh @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to their intrinsically faint , heterogeneous nature , and their likely occurrence in dusty starburst regions , to date they have yet to be exploited in cosmological studies .",
    "however , as the predicted sneii counts to faint survey limits ( e.g. @xmath7 ) will outnumber those of sneia ( madau et al .  1998 ; dahlen & fransson  1999 , porciani & madau  2000 ) ,",
    "the detection of sneii at higher-@xmath3 should become more practical as these fainter limits are attained  either through facilities such as the _ ngst _",
    "@xcite or via studies of the type introduced here .",
    "sneia , by contrast , arise from lower mass ( @xmath8 ) stars , and their rate depends strongly on the ( as yet ) unknown configuration of the progenitor system as well as the cosmic sfh . the sneia rate therefore",
    "can not yet be used to directly probe the sfh without a more detailed knowledge of the physics of sneia explosions .",
    "the observed rate does however offer important implications for the possible progenitor models @xcite and , at @xmath9 , the predicted metal - dependency of the sneia rate will provide valuable clues to the metal enrichment at high-@xmath3 @xcite , as well as for the practicality of extending the hubble diagram for more precise cosmological tests @xcite .",
    "the study of distant sne of both types is one of the key programs underpinning the _ ngst",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the optimum strategy for finding and studying sne , particularly with respect to the investigation of sneii and the sfh at @xmath0 , clearly depends on their abundance . in this paper",
    ", we suggest a strategy for producing the first observational constraints using existing facilities .",
    "the strategy proposed follows the idea proposed by kolatt & bartelmann  ( 1998 ) and a similar approach used to locate faint sub - mm sources @xcite . by exploiting the magnification bias afforded by counting sources viewed through the cores of strong lensing clusters , fainter detection thresholds",
    "can be reached @xcite . in the case of the sub - mm surveys the intrinsic flux limits achieved are fainter than those reached in more ambitious dedicated deep surveys . adopting the same principle , optical searches for",
    "lensed sne should provide a first glimpse of the evolution of sne at high-@xmath3 ahead of the launch of _",
    "ngst_.    a plan of the paper follows . in @xmath102 , we review the theoretical aspects of gravitational lensing as applicable to our proposed search and discuss the uncertainties associated with modelling sne rates .",
    "this allows us to predict the source counts and redshift distribution for a survey with and without the effect of lensing . in @xmath103",
    "we discuss a possible application of the technique using the _ hst _  data archive .",
    "only two rich clusters with the necessary lensing credentials have been multiply - visited in a single passband by _ hst _ , and we discuss one possible sne found in each . in @xmath104",
    "we discuss the possibilities of classifying such detections via various follow - up strategies .",
    "we present our conclusions in @xmath105 . throughout the paper , for consistency with the sneia and microwave background results , we assume a lambda dominated cosmology of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "the approach proposed is identical to that successfully employed in probing the faint sub - mm sources @xcite .",
    "the core of a rich lensing cluster magnifies suitably - located background sources by factors of several .",
    "the critical difference with the sub - mm studies is that , for faint sne studied at optical wavelengths , the exquisite angular resolution of _ hst _  is essential .",
    "the modest boost in detectability afforded by surveying through a massive foreground cluster significantly extends the mean detectable redshift .",
    "we primarily consider a search using the _ hst _  and the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc-2 ) .",
    "the high spatial resolution , dark sky background and relatively large field - of - view ( 5.71@xmath15 ) of this telescope / instrument combination ensures faint survey limits can be reached in a reasonable exposure time .",
    "we also briefly consider the advantages of using the forthcoming advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) _ hst _  instrument , with a larger ( 11.33@xmath15 ) field - of - view .",
    "in the rest of this section we investigate this observational approach by calculating the number density @xmath16 of sne of different types with and without the magnification produced by a massive cluster located at various redshifts .",
    "below we introduce the theoretical aspects of both the lensing and the intrinsic sne properties as a function of redshift .",
    "the role of clusters in gravitational lensing has been reviewed by many authors ( see , for example , blandford & narayan   or hattori , kneib & makino   and references therein ) .",
    "a gravitational lens will distort and magnify a background source by an amount that depends on both the position of the source behind the cluster , and the relative redshifts of the source and the lens .",
    "this results in different background regions suffering different degrees of amplification , depending on their location behind the cluster . through the location and spectroscopic identifications of multiply - imaged arcs",
    "@xcite , it is possible to correct for this effect by utilising a well - constrained cluster mass model to the accuracy required .",
    "these models involve multiple component mass distributions that are able to trace the potential well of a cluster and its more massive individual member galaxies @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in these best cases is currently @xmath17 per cent @xcite .",
    "the degree of magnification that one can expect in the central regions of such massive clusters  the areas sampled when conducting lensed sne searches  are typically of order @xmath184 for sources at @xmath19 @xcite , where @xmath20 is defined as the ratio of the magnified flux to the flux measured in the absence of lensing .",
    "however , this boost in sensitivity  or effective increase in the sne number density as fainter sne become brighter than the survey limiting magnitude due to amplification  is offset by the competing effect of depletion .",
    "this results in a decrease in the sne number density , as the unit solid angle in the unlensed source plane _ increases _ by a factor of @xmath21 in the lensed case , resulting in a _ decrease _ in the sne number density by @xmath21 .    when attempting to determine a precise count rate of lensed sources , accurate modelling is essential . here",
    ", we choose to model the cluster mass distribution more simply via a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , where the mass density @xmath22 of the virialized dark matter halo of a cluster is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a radial coordinate , and @xmath22 is parameterized through @xmath25 , the one - dimensional velocity dispersion .",
    "the mass @xmath26 of a halo interior to @xmath24 is then @xmath27 .",
    "this corresponds to a constant deflection angle for incident light rays , @xmath28 , always pointing towards the lens centre of symmetry . for a source",
    "that , in the absence of lensing , would be seen at an angular distance @xmath29 from this centre , the lens equation leads to an image at @xmath30 , with magnification @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the einstein radius , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the angular diameter distances between the observer , the lens , and the source",
    ". if the alignment is @xmath35 ( strong lensing ) , a second image is produced at @xmath36 with magnification @xmath37 .",
    "high - resolution @xmath38body simulations have recently shown , however , that haloes formed through hierarchical clustering have a universal density profile which is shallower than isothermal ( but still diverging like @xmath39 ) near the halo centre , and steeper than isothermal ( with @xmath40 ) in its outer regions ( navarro , frenk , & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ) .",
    "this profile takes the form :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the critical density at the lens redshift , @xmath43 is a characteristic over - density , and @xmath44 is a scale radius , where @xmath45 is a dimensionless number measuring the `` concentration '' of the halo , and the virial radius , @xmath46 , is defined as the radius inside which the mass density is equal to @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath43 is related to @xmath45 via    @xmath48    we can then see that @xmath49 .",
    "the nfw haloes are thus defined by two parameters ; @xmath45 , and either @xmath46 or @xmath50 .",
    "the lens equation for the nfw density distribution has been computed by several authors @xcite , and a good summary of its application can be found in hattori et al .  .",
    "with respect to sis profiles containing the same total mass and located at the same redshift , nfw lenses have smaller cross sections for producing multiple images , but this is compensated for by the fact that the average magnification of the images is higher for nfw haloes .",
    "in other words , nfw haloes are efficient magnifiers but poor image - splitters  a sis profile underestimates the magnification obtained compared to an nfw profile .    in the following calculations , we model the lensing clusters using both sis and nfw profiles . as a guide to the benefits of searching for sne through clusters , we have explored two hypothetical cases : a survey conducted through a sample of ( known ) @xmath51 @xmath52 clusters , and a similar sample of @xmath53 clusters now being located through the macs survey",
    "( see for example ebeling , edge & henry  2000 ) . to meaningfully compare the magnifications of sis and nfw profiles",
    ", we assume that for both profiles the clusters have identical masses interior to the virial radius , @xmath46 .",
    "we then equate the expressions for @xmath54 at @xmath46 for both profiles , and hence set @xmath46 for the nfw profile given a value for @xmath25 .",
    "for the nfw profiles , the concentration parameter @xmath45 for each cluster is calculated for our cosmology using the fortran routine _",
    "charden.f _ provided by j. navarro .",
    "the median area - weighted amplifications are calculated by considering a pixel matrix corresponding to the wfpc-2 ccd , and determining the amplification suffered by a background source were it to appear in each element .",
    "the median pixel amplification can then be found .",
    "[ amplificationfigure ] shows this amplification of a background source as a function of source redshift for two typical clusters .",
    "typical median amplifications of @xmath553 are typical of @xmath56 sources , corresponding to a brightening in magnitudes of @xmath57 .",
    "we now estimate the number of sne we would expect to find to a given survey magnitude limit at a given epoch , in the case of a blank field ( i.e. without any significant lensing magnification ) and through a rich cluster .",
    "we will not include those ( unlensed ) sne that occur in the cluster galaxies , and will therefore underestimate the total number of new sne that will be found in a lensed search .",
    "the number counts depend on both the intrinsic redshift - dependent sne rate , and that period of the light curve during which time the sne appears brighter than the survey search limit .",
    "a number of workers have modelled the expected evolution in the sne rate with redshift .",
    "most have followed a similar route to that employed by madau et al .  , who base their estimates on the observed luminosity densities which trace the cosmic star formation history ( sfh ) . using various diagnostics ,",
    "the cosmic sfh can now be traced to high redshift ( @xmath58 ) , although some details remain controversial .",
    "as the progenitor lifetimes for sneii are very short by cosmological standards , the sneii rate can be calculated directly from the sfh provided an initial mass function ( imf ) is assumed .",
    "here we adopt a salpeter   imf with lower and upper mass cut - offs of @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .    in modelling the sneii rate ,",
    "the form of the cosmic sfh is critical .",
    "the original study of the evolution in the comoving star - formation rate based on optically selected galaxy surveys @xcite suggested a sharp rise from @xmath61 to a peak at @xmath622 by a factor of almost 10 @xcite , followed by a decline at high-@xmath3 .",
    "however , more recent studies suggest that the evolution of the sfh up to @xmath63 may have been overestimated , perhaps only increasing by a factor of @xmath64 @xcite , and that the sfr at high-@xmath3 may be obscured due to large amounts of dust extinction ( see , for example , pettini et al .  1998 and blain et al",
    ".  1999b ) .",
    "the form of this evolution to @xmath65 is crucial for our studies when predicting the sneii rate .",
    "we consider two illustrative sfhs .",
    "the first ( sfh - i ) is taken from madau & pozetti  , and provides a convenient analytical fit of the form :    @xmath66    which assumes an imf lower mass cut - off of @xmath67 and an einstein de sitter ( eds ) universe . multiplying by a factor of 1.67 will convert to a salpeter imf with a lower mass cut - off of @xmath59 .",
    "we convert the sfh to the @xmath68-dominated universe assumed here by computing the difference in luminosity density between an eds universe and our cosmology , and applying this correction to the fit above .",
    "the sfh fit matches most uv - continuum and h@xmath69 luminosity densities from @xmath61 to @xmath70 , includes a mild correction for dust of @xmath71 mag ( @xmath72 mag ) , and implies a local sneii rate of @xmath73 , very close to that observed by cappellaro , evans & turatto  .    however , the sfr evolution in this model to @xmath74 is both stronger , and results in a lower local sfr , than more recent measurements ( cowie et al .",
    "1999 ; sullivan et al .",
    "accordingly , we also consider a second sfh ( sfh - ii ) with a shallower evolution ( a factor of @xmath75 from @xmath61 to @xmath76 in an eds universe , and constant thereafter ) , but one which over - produces the local sneii rate .",
    "the sneii rates as a function of redshift are shown in fig .",
    "[ snerates ] .",
    "the sneia rate is more difficult to model due to the uncertain nature of the progenitor system .",
    "the evolution expected depends critically on whether sneia occur in double or single degenerate progenitor systems ( for a review see nomoto et  al .   and references therein ) , and there is much debate in the literature as to what form any evolution should take .",
    "we consider a commonly used empirical approach , and represent the uncertainty in terms of two parameters ( madau et al .",
    "1998 ; dahlen & fransson  1999 ) .",
    "the first is a delay time @xmath77 , between the binary system formation and sne explosion epochs , which defines a ( time - independent ) explosion probability per white dwarf .",
    "the second is an explosion efficiency , @xmath78 , which accounts for the fraction of binary systems that never result in a sne .",
    "this efficiency @xmath78 is constrained using a preliminary determination of the sneia rate at @xmath79 of @xmath80 by pain et  al .   using a sample of 38 sneia from the scp",
    "( see also pain et al .",
    "2000b ) .",
    "we consider two sneia evolutions , shown in fig .",
    "[ snerates ] .",
    "the first has a small value of @xmath81 ( corresponding to a shallower decline at high-@xmath3 , ) whilst the second is a larger value of @xmath82 , which produces a steeper drop - off . for comparison , the @xmath79 rate of pain et  al .",
    "is also shown in fig .",
    "[ snerates ] , together with the difference that arises from using the two sfhs , and how these histories tend to over or under - predict the local sne rates .    while much published data exists for sneia , by contrast there is a dearth of data for sneii and a great variety in their spectra , peak magnitudes and light curves . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we adopt the models of gilliland , nugent & phillips   ( hereafter gnp ) which incorporate recent light curve templates , @xmath83-corrections and luminosity functions for sneia and ii .",
    "these models include observed dispersions in the peak magnitudes of sneia and ii , which are included in our simulations of our sne counts ( see gnp for a full discussion of the models and simulations ) .",
    "the major advantage to using gnp s models lies in the fact that the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are more realistic than those employed previously for rate calculations and follow the true temporal evolution of these objects .",
    "the sneia template was constructed using data from _ iue _ and _ hst _",
    "@xcite in the uv and a large number of ground - based observations in the optical .",
    "spectrum synthesis calculations were carried out by pn for the sneii s using the non - lte code phoenix 9.0 @xcite .",
    "the spectra of sne1979c @xcite , 1992h and 1993w ( courtesy d. leonard ) were fit at several epochs .",
    "the resultant fits of these spectra provided a nice match to the observed data and yield a crude sed template for the sneii s .",
    "the major emphasis of this effort was to model the uv as well as possible ( this portion of the sed dominates in high-@xmath3 searches using filters bluer than @xmath84 ) , since the simple assumption of blackbody seds has been shown to be quite inaccurate ( see fig .",
    "10 of gnp ) .",
    "we can now combine the two mass models from @xmath10[modelclusters ] and the various sne rate models from @xmath10[modelsne ] to estimate the number counts of sne with and without the presence of a strong - lensing cluster .    as with blank - field surveys , searches such as those outlined here require two images of the same rich cluster , but with the two epochs of observation separated by a suitable amount to allow the sne to become visible .",
    "when estimating the simple count rate of lensed high-@xmath3 sne , therefore , both forward ( sne in second image ) and backward ( sne in first image ) searches can be included , and to allow for the time dilation of the high-@xmath3 sne , we assume a time of at least 2yrs between the two exposures . table  [ count_table ] gives the counts expected to survey limits of @xmath85 & @xmath86 , assuming @xmath87 .",
    "when comparing lensed and unlensed counts , one of the key factors is the slope of the sne number counts , @xmath88 . for @xmath89 , we expect lensing to increase the number counts , while for @xmath90 , lensing will have the opposite effect ( depletion ) .",
    "the slopes in our models depend on i ) the intrinsic sne properties , contained in the models of gnp , and ii ) our assumed redshift evolution of the sne number density .",
    "the models of gnp include the best - determined uncertainties in the sne properties , for example in the dispersion of the peak sne magnitude , and our simulations therefore account for this first uncertainty .",
    "the redshift evolution of the sne numbers depends on which sfh we use , and , for sneia , the value of the delay time , @xmath77 . by running simulations for the unlensed case",
    ", we find that typical values of @xmath69 for sneii for sfh - i are @xmath91 , and for sfh - ii @xmath92 .",
    "there is little variation in these values between simulation runs .",
    "the number - redshift relation is plotted in fig .",
    "[ magnz ] .",
    "as one would expect , the figure shows there is little difference in the rate of sne up to @xmath93 . from @xmath93 to @xmath1 , the lensed counts are lower than those appropriate for blank field searches .",
    "this is due to the effect of depletion mentioned above , which unfortunately negates the lensing benefits . however , the important differences begin at @xmath0 , where we sample a fainter , more numerous population of sne .",
    "lensing has the principal effect of increasing the proportion of sne found at high-@xmath3 , bringing fainter , magnified examples into view .",
    "there is then a corresponding extension in the redshift distribution .",
    "for example , for the @xmath94 nfw cluster , the mean redshift of detection changes from @xmath95 to @xmath96 , and the number of detections at @xmath0 increases from 20 to 31 per cent .",
    "the numbers drop sharply by @xmath97 , even in the lensed case , due to the uv drop - off in the sne spectrum being redshifted into the @xmath98 filter , which prevents the detection of higher-@xmath3 sne .",
    "we note that the use of _ hst _  and an infra - red search would allow the detection of lensed @xmath99 sne which would be undetectable in the unlensed case .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ count_table ]",
    "clearly , the number of detectable sne depends on many variables which forms a strong motivation for this search , particularly in view of the need to quantify the high redshift rate in anticipation of detailed studies with _ ngst_. a robust prediction from table  [ count_table ] is the high chance of discovering a new sne during a repeat exposure of a previously studied lensing cluster .",
    "specifically , to a reasonably modest magnitude limit ( achievable in @xmath1002 orbits ) , we can expect to discover 1 to 3 sne per visit if we combine forward and backward searches .    to demonstrate the potential of such a search",
    ", we have analysed the _ hst _",
    "data archive in the case of repeated observations of strong - lensing clusters for which mass models are available .",
    "though there are few such repeated visits with the same filters , exposure times , enough images for a thorough cosmic - ray rejection and a satisfactory delay between the ` reference ' and ` discovery ' images , we have none the less discovered a candidate event in the rich cluster ac114 .",
    "the core of cluster ac114 ( @xmath2 ) was observed on three occasions with wfpc-2 in the f702w filter ( see natarajan et al .",
    "the first two observations have total exposure times of 16.8ks each and were taken on jd50086.3 and 50089.3 ( go#5935 ) . both of these observations suffered from scheduling problems which resulted in the images having @xmath1015@xmath102 the nominal sky background , limiting their sensitivity to @xmath103 rather than the expected @xmath104 . as a result",
    "the cluster core was re - observed in director s discretionary time ( go#7201 ) on jd50747.5 for a further 15.6ks .",
    "each of the observations comprises 6 single - orbit exposures in 3 pairs , each of which was spatially offset by 3 wfc pixels to enable the removal of hot pixels and similar artefacts .",
    "the observations are shifted so as to place the cluster cd on wfc4 ( jd50086.3 ) , wfc2 ( jd50089.3 ) and on the boundary of wfc3wfc4 ( jd50747.5 ) with space - craft orientations of pa(v3)=270 , 270 and 220 degrees respectively .",
    "the three observations of the cluster core therefore sample very different areas of the wfpc-2 detectors , and the combination of this with the staggered timing makes this dataset well suited for searching for faint variable sources .",
    "the data was reduced using the standard stsci pipeline , aligned with integer pixel shifts and then stacked using the stsdas task crrej .",
    "the observations were calibrated using the f702w zero - point quoted by holtzman  et  al .  .",
    "finally , the three observations were rotated and aligned to allow a search for objects whose brightness varies between the visits .",
    "the overlapping area between the three observations comprises a total area of roughly @xmath105 and this region was searched for sources which were seen in both the jd50086.3 and 50089.3 observations , but which were missing from the jd50747.5 observation .",

    "though the object could be a sneia in the envelope of the central cd galaxy , this would make it very faint unless caught at the end of its light curve .",
    "note that the absence of a counterimage is not unexpected given the likely time delay involved .",
    "gal - yam & maoz  ( 2000 ) have conducted a similar comparison of the strong - lensing cluster a2218 which revealed another potential sne .",
    "they detect a transient object ( @xmath111 ) in an f606w march 1999 image , but which is absent from both an f606w january 2000 and an f702w september 1994 image .",
    "though the relative brightness of this sne suggests that it occurred in a @xmath112 cluster member galaxy , the usefulness of strategically surveying strong lensing clusters , for both lensed and unlensed sne , is well demonstrated .",
    "as we have seen in @xmath10[predictedcounts ] , there is a high degree of likelihood of detecting a new sne in a repeat visit to a strong lensing cluster .",
    "we will now discuss possible follow - up strategies to any detections , and the type of science that can be achieved from these types of surveys .    as with early ground - based sneia searches conducted in rich clusters @xcite",
    ", it could be difficult to isolate the sne , constrain its type , and determine a redshift .",
    "these early sne searches were , however , essential in motivating astronomers to execute the later more ambitious programs , and before any concerted follow - up programs can be developed , it is first necessary to determine how many lensed sne there may be and , where possible , their properties .",
    "one of the primary benefits of the lensed search is the fact that faint , high-@xmath3 sne  which would otherwise be too faint for spectroscopic follow - up  are brightened sufficiently for spectroscopy to become feasible .",
    "we estimate that @xmath113 per cent of @xmath9 sources could be followed in this way , compared to @xmath114 per cent without lensing .",
    "such highly - lensed sne such as these will typically be identifiable via their proximity to the cluster core .",

    "new sne will be caught at various stages on their light curve .",
    "we consider a statistical approach to classifying the detected sne based on their colour distribution using a ground - based follow - up to any @xmath115 detections using , as an example , the nirc on the keck - ii telescope .",

    "the ridgeline of redder sneiis arises from the fact that sneiis settle down to a constant colour after @xmath117 days in the restframe .",
    "the other ridges and gaps in the diagram are a product of the light curve , for example there is a greater likelihood of detecting a sne in a plateau phase than during a steep decline .",

    "these red objects would be detected in follow - ups using large ground - based telescopes in the @xmath118-band ; i.e. those detected in @xmath118 are likely to be higher-@xmath3 and likely to be sneii .",
    "several photometric measurements can determine the rate of decline over a lunation and further constrain the type .",
    "the bluest detections will be sneia observed close to maximum light .",
    "these may be further distinguished via the presence of a host galaxy whose redshift can be measured .    although simply determining the number counts in searches such as these is important , it is interesting to consider other applications and their impact on our understanding of sne .",
    "the number counts of sneia predicted is small , and it would be difficult to advance the existing hubble diagram using this method .",
    "accurate amplification corrections to the detected magnitudes would also be required .",
    "the mass models of most rich clusters are currently accurate to around 1020 per cent , which would lead to uncertainties in the magnitudes of around 0.5mag , insufficient for distinctions of a cosmological world model to be made .",
    "however , the _ mere detection _ of a high-@xmath3 ( and therefore red ) sneia would have important implications for the metallicity of the progenitor system . in a survey conducted to @xmath119 across 40 clusters",
    ", we would expect @xmath120 sneia to be found in the forward search , 23 of which would be at @xmath0 . using these , the first tests of the high-@xmath3 sneia rate could begin .    a significant achievement would be the determination of the high-@xmath3 sneii rate , no measurement of which yet exists . the sneia rate study of pain et al",
    ".   at @xmath79 shows that a sample of 38  sne results in statistical and systematic uncertainties in the sne rate of @xmath121 per cent .",
    "again , in a survey of 40 clusters , we would expect around @xmath122 sneii to be detected in the ` forward ' search which could then be followed up from the ground .",
    "of these @xmath123 would be sneii at @xmath0 , and using the cluster mass models and an assumed cosmology , measures of the sfr at @xmath1242 could be made in an independent manner to existing measurements .",
    "all these rates will be increased by using a larger field - of - view instrument , for example the 11.33@xmath15 advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) . as an example",
    ", we repeated the simulations using this instrument and the @xmath81 , sfh - ii , @xmath125 survey limit scenarios , shown as the bottom line in table  [ count_table ] . with this instrument ,",
    "the predicted counts to @xmath125 are as high as using the wfpc-2 to a survey limit of @xmath126 , and it becomes almost certain that a sne will be found , and the larger field - of - view , and hence coverage of the lensing cluster , results in the potential discoverey of more high-@xmath3 sne .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a technique for detecting sne at @xmath0 by utilising the magnification bias obtained by searching through rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "we summarise our main conclusions as follows :    1 .",
    "we have shown that a search utilising repeat _ hst _",
    "wfpc-2 visits covering the cores of rich @xmath940.6 clusters would reveal @xmath1003 new sne , of which @xmath127 per cent will be of type ii .",
    "such a search will both increase the mean redshift of detected sne , and will result in a threefold increase in the number of @xmath9 sne detected .",
    "we have applied our technique using _ hst _  archival data , and have discovered a possible sne event in the cluster ac114 at @xmath2 .",
    "we have discussed various follow - up strategies .",
    "the brightest events ( to @xmath128 ) can be followed spectroscopically using large ground - based telescopes , and a fraction of these will be highly lensed @xmath9 sne , which it would not be possible to follow - up without the lensing boost . for fainter sne , @xmath118-band imaging will detect and select the redder , high-@xmath3 sne , and the light curve measurements can constrain the type .",
    "we have discussed the potential scientific benefits of such a search , including the determination of the high-@xmath3 sne rates , constraints on the cosmic sfh , and the possibility of eliminating some sneia progenitor models .",
    "we briefly consider the merits of using the advanced camera for surveys , and find that even to @xmath125 , we expect @xmath129 sne per search ( one of which will lie at @xmath0 ) with a greater extension in the redshift range probed .",
    "we note the preprint of saini et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which also examines the effect of gravitational lensing by massive clusters on high - redshift sne , in particular those located near to giant arcs where the lensing effect is strongest . for the case of the cluster a2218",
    ", they conclude such arcs could enhance the s / n of detected sne by @xmath130 , and that such lensing would substantially extend the maximum redshift of sne detection .",
    "we note that they also advocate the monitoring of such systems for the detection of cosmologically useful sne at @xmath1 and beyond .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee whose comments improved this manuscript .",
    "we also thank reynald pain for providing his pre - publication value of the sneia rate , and saul perlmutter , jean - paul kneib and cristiano porciani for their many helpful discussions in preparing this paper .",
