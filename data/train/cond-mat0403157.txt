    "integer sequences are ubiquitous in pure and applied mathematics , physics , and computer science @xcite . while traditional integer sequences are deterministic , there is a growing interest in stochastic counterparts of fundamental sequences and their relevance to disordered or random systems .",
    "for example , the random fibonacci sequence @xmath5 @xcite has links with various topics in condensed matter physics , dynamical systems , products of random matrices , etc .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "random integer sequences are conceptually simple , yet they exhibit a complex phenomenology resulting from the memory generated by the stochastic recursion law . for the random fibonacci sequence , the typical behavior is @xmath6 with the intriguing lyapunov exponent @xmath7 ; furthermore , the distribution of the ratio @xmath8 has singularities at every rational value @xcite and the model exhibits a remarkably intricate spectrum @xcite . also , the typical growth is different than the average growth as characterized by the moments @xmath9 .",
    "another form of randomness in which an element in the series depends on two previous elements , at least one of which is chosen randomly , was introduce recently @xcite .",
    "for example , the stochastic fibonacci - like series defined recursively by the rule @xmath10 with @xmath11 randomly chosen between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , exhibits the typical growth @xmath14 with the ( numerically calculated ) lyapunov exponent @xmath15 .",
    "the moments exhibit multiscaling @xcite and the probability distribution becomes log - normal asymptotically .",
    "small variations in the recurrence rule can lead to substantial changes in the sequence characteristics  the growth law may be algebraic , log - normal , or exponential and the distribution may or may not exhibit multiscaling of the moments . in this article , we show that much of this phenomenology is captured by even simpler stochastic series , for which a more detailed analytical treatment is feasible .",
    "we consider recursively defined series where an element is determined by a _",
    "single _ previously chosen element .",
    "a natural starting point is the random geometric series @xmath16 when @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the index @xmath11 is chosen randomly between @xmath12 and @xmath13 at each step .",
    "the first element is @xmath18 .",
    "for example , for @xmath19 , there are two , equally probable sequences : @xmath20 or @xmath21",
    ". the series may not necessarily be monotonic .",

    "this recursion is solved using the generating function @xmath24 .",
    "the recursion relation ( [ mom - rec ] ) leads to the ordinary differential equation @xmath25 subject to the boundary condition @xmath26 . expanding the solution @xmath27 in powers of @xmath28 gives the moments @xmath29    the first and the second moment are given by simple polynomials @xmath30 generally , there is a series of special values of @xmath31 for which the moments are polynomial in @xmath1 . for @xmath32 with @xmath33 being an integer ,",

    "the probability distribution of the random variable @xmath38 and its typical behavior are obtained by considering a closely related random sequence .",
    "since the spectrum of possible values for @xmath38 is @xmath39 with integer @xmath40 , we study the variable @xmath41 .",

    "the very same recurrence generates @xmath54 , the stirling numbers of the first kind @xcite .",
    "these numbers are closely related to the binomial coefficients and appear in numerous applications @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath55 , and the probability distribution is expressed in terms of these special numbers as follows : @xmath56    moments of the variable @xmath57 are obtained from the generating function @xcite satisfied by the stirling numbers of the first kind @xcite @xmath58 taking the logarithmic derivative gives the average @xmath59 in terms of the harmonic numbers @xmath60 . using the large @xmath1 asymptotics of the harmonic numbers @xcite , we conclude that the average grows logarithmically @xmath61    the second derivative similarly gives @xmath62 .",

    "moreover , the variance of the random variable @xmath74 is simply @xmath75 .",
    "both the poissonian and the gaussian behaviors follow from the more general asymptotic form of @xmath76 @xmath77 that holds when @xmath78 and @xmath79 with the ratio @xmath80 being finite . indeed , using the asymptotic relation",
    "@xmath81 as @xmath82 one recovers ( [ poisson ] ) ; the peak of the distribution ( [ modified ] ) is at @xmath83 and expansion in the vicinity of this peak recovers ( [ gaussian ] ) .",

    "to derive ( [ modified ] ) , we use ( [ dis - sol])([stirling ] ) and the cauchy theorem to express @xmath76 as an integral @xmath84 over an arbitrary simple closed contour enclosing the origin in the complex @xmath85 plane .",

    "writing @xmath88 and taking into account that the dominant contribution is gathered near @xmath89 , we obtain @xmath90 where we used two properties of the gamma function  the difference equation @xmath91 and the asymptotic relation @xmath92 as @xmath93 . inserting @xmath87 and using the stirling formula leads to ( [ modified ] )",
    ".      the asymptotic distribution ( [ gaussian ] ) and the growth law ( [ m - av - large ] ) lead to the typical behavior @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 the euler s constant . since asymptotically",

    "the lyapunov exponent @xmath100 , defined via @xmath101 is obtained from the moment spectrum using @xmath102 .",

    ".    there are large fluctuations between successive elements in a given series and large series - to - series variations .",
    "the typical behavior is eventually approached but very slowly , as illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "let us compare random geometric series with random fibonacci - like series .",
    "overall , the behavior is in line with the behavior found for the series @xmath10 with @xmath44 . in both cases ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath38 is log - normal and the moments exhibit multiscaling @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "it is possible to find the lyapunov exponent .",
    "however , the behavior is unlike the one found for the random sequence @xmath104 with despite the fact that in both cases the average is @xmath105 .",
    "the average characterizes all the moments and the distribution approaches an ordinary scaling from @xmath106 @xcite .",

    ", this set contains no gaps , so the span is equivalent to the largest sequence element @xmath107 .",
    "thus , the span is directly related to extremal characteristics of the sequence .",
    "to find how @xmath107 grow with @xmath1 , it is necessary to consider the large @xmath67 tail of the probability distribution outside the gaussian region .",
    "the modified poissonian distribution ( [ modified ] ) suggests that @xmath108 .",
    "we obtain the growth of the maximal element in the series heuristically using the extreme value criterion @xmath109 since the the distribution @xmath76 quickly diminishes with @xmath67 in the tail region , this extreme statistics criterion becomes @xmath110 , and as @xmath111 , one has @xmath112 combining this criterion with the distribution ( [ modified ] ) and using the stirling formula , we arrive to the following asymptotic growth of the maximal value @xmath113 numerical simulations are in good agreement with this estimate ( fig .  2 ) . a more rigorous derivation including the leading correction is given in appendix a.    this growth is ultimately connected with the frequency by which the largest element in the sequence occurs . at the @xmath1th step",

    "the growth law ( [ mn ] ) implies @xmath119 .",
    "there are a number of natural generalizations of the stochastic sequences ( [ rule - mult ] ) and ( [ rule - add ] ) .",
