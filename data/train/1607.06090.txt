    "nonlocality is a fundamental property of nature in which the statistics obtained by performing some local measurements on some composite quantum systems can not be reproduced by any local hidden variable model @xcite .",
    "these so - called nonlocal correlations can not be mimicked by any local deterministic strategy , even if assisted by shared randomness @xcite .",
    "nonlocality is detected by the violation of a bell inequality @xcite and it has recently been demonstrated in three loophole - free bell experiments @xcite .",
    "detection of nonlocality is a sufficient condition to demonstrate , in a device - independent ( di ) way , that the state producing such correlations is entangled . from an operational point of view",
    ", nonlocality is a resource that enables the implementation of di quantum information protocols , such as di quantum key distribution @xcite , di randomness expansion @xcite or amplification @xcite , or di self - testing @xcite .",
    "the study of quantum many - body systems has benefited during the last decades from insights of the field of quantum information ; in particular concerning the understanding of their correlations @xcite .",
    "this has , however , mostly focused on the study and experimental detection of entanglement @xcite , while the role of nonlocal correlations , which are stronger , remains rather unexplored .",
    "there are at least three reasons for that : first , the known bell inequalities for multipartite systems involve correlations among many particles @xcite , thus rendering their measurement a formidably challenging task .",
    "second , the mathematical characterization of nonlocal correlations is an np - hard problem @xcite .",
    "third , the size of the description of multipartite quantum states grows , in general , exponentially with the system size , posing a strong barrier to the analysis of the quantum correlations in large systems .",
    "however , recent advances @xcite have shown that , by measuring only one- and two - body correlation functions , nonlocality can be revealed in some multipartite quantum systems , opening the way to its detection in many - body systems @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we show that the ground states of some quantum spin hamiltonians in one spatial dimension are nonlocal .",
    "we assign a bell inequality to the given hamiltonian in a natural way and we calculate its classical bound using dynamic programming .",
    "the bell inequality is constructed in such a way that , for appropriate quantum observables , the bell operator coincides with the hamiltonian .",
    "the idea is that if the ground state energy is beyond the classical bound , this signals the presence of nonlocal correlations in the the ground state .",
    "the ground state energy is computed by exact diagonalization using the jordan - wigner transformation , which maps the system of spins to a quadratic system of fermions .",
    "the method just presented can also be seen from the opposite point of view , namely , as a way to optimize certain classes of bell inequalities for many - body systems under some quantum observables .",
    "we also study the translationally invariant ( ti ) setting , in which we provide an exponentially faster algorithm to find the classical bound and we obtain analytical results for the quantum value .",
    "then we illustrate our framework by applying it to several examples : a tight ti bell inequality for @xmath0 parties , a quasi ti bell inequality for any even number of parties , and we show that the ground state of an xy spin glass has nonlocal correlations in some parameter region .",

    "in this work we have shown , on the one hand , that the ground states of some spin hamiltonians are nonlocal .",
    "we have associated a bell inequality to the hamiltonian and we have computed its classical bound .",
    "we have exactly diagonalized the hamiltonian and we have computed its quantum value .",
    "we have achieved this goal by combining two rather unexplored techniques in quantum information , which are dynamic programming and the jordan - wigner transformation .",

    "these tools have provided us a new way to optimize certain classes of bell inequalities , and look for their quantum violation under conveniently chosen observables . in the ti case",
    ", we have provided an algorithm to find the classical bound that is exponentially faster in the system size and we have obtained exact analytical solutions for the quantum value .",
    "then , we have applied these techniques to several examples in which we reveal nonlocality : a tight ti bell inequality with a ti bell operator for @xmath0 parties , a quasi ti bell inequality with a uniparametric quasi ti xy hamiltonian and the ground state of a xy spin glass in some parameter region .",
    "these findings open the possibility to the implementation of multipartite quantum information protocols that use nonlocality as a key resource , by using ground states of hamiltonians that appear naturally .",
    "we remark that the hamiltonians and the bell inequalities we have studied have a finite interaction range , which in the ti case makes them particularly interesting from an experimentally - friendly perspective .",
    "note that previous bell inequalities for quantum many - body systems with low order correlators were specially designed for a permutationally invariant ( pi ) symmetry @xcite ; while being able to detect nonlocality in ground states of physical hamiltonians such as the lipkin - meshkov - glick @xcite or a spin - squeezed bose - einstein condensate @xcite , the information accessible to these inequalities is bound to a de finetti theorem @xcite , thus becoming more compatible with that produced by a separable state as the system grows @xcite .",
    "this requires to increase the number of measurements with the system size in order to close the finite - statistics loophole @xcite . however , many systems of interest are not pi , but ti , and we have studied the latter in this work . in this case , a de finetti restriction does not apply , making the detection of nonlocality more robust to experimental imperfections .",
    "interestingly , to study the bell inequalities proposed in @xcite , in the classical and quantum many - body regime , one employs powerful mathematical tools ( namely , convex hulls of semialgebraic sets @xcite or the schur - weyl duality from representation theory @xcite , respectively ) , which no longer apply when the pi symmetry is broken .",
    "here we have used other mathematical tools ( dynamic programming for the classical bound and the jw transformation for the quantum value ) that allowed us to solve , even exactly , the two cases with this much weaker symmetry .",
    "let us finalize by pointing out possible future research directions that stem from our work . throughout this paper , we have restricted ourselves to the study of nonlocality in one - dimensional spin short - ranged hamiltonians , as we could compute their ground state energy with exact diagonalization .",
    "one can eliminate this restriction and study short - ranged spin hamiltonians by using a matrix product state ( mps ) description of the state , which is a good ansatz for these systems @xcite .",
    "the bell inequalities that we would naturally associate to them would still be of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bellineq ] ) , because the interaction range @xmath3 would be fixed , so we could still efficiently find their classical bound .",
    "conversely , we can eliminate the restriction on the subset of observables that we choose in section [ sec : otherway ] and the string of @xmath34 s in the middle of the string operators , thus studying purely two - body correlator inequalities like the classes derived in @xcite .",
    "in such cases , powerful numerical algorithms such as dmrg @xcite would be suitably tailored to perform the quantum optimization and check whether nonlocality is detected .",
    "one could also generalize our results in other directions .",
    "since bell inequalities with more than two inputs or outputs per party are not , in general , maximally violated by measuring qubits @xcite , if one would like to increase the chance to detect nonlocality with these more general classes of bell inequalities , increasing the physical dimension of the system would be a way to obtain better results . the tools presented here could be extended by using a generalized jw transformation @xcite from qudits to parafermions , although the problem becomes algebraically more involved .",
    "we have also seen through the examples presented that there is a strong relation between hamiltonians of physical systems and bell inequalities that we associate to them .",
    "whereas we naturally establish this connection in the following direction : starting from the hamiltonian of a physical system , we assign a bell inequality to it , one can think of this relation in a more general way , since there are many bell inequalities that , with the appropriate observables , realize the same physical hamiltonian . with the tools we have presented here , it is now possible that , given a physical one - dimensional hamiltonian with short - range interactions , tailor the best bell inequality that reveals the nonlocality of its ground state , as such hamiltonian corresponds to the realization of a bell operator of many different bell inequalities , each with its own classical bound , which we can compute efficiently .",
