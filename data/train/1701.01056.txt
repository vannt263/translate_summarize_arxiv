    "when the star contracts , the h shell reignites and protons in the intershell are captured by the abundant @xmath8c nuclei to yield primary @xmath1c . if more protons than @xmath8c nuclei are diffused in the outer layers , a region of primary @xmath9n may form by further proton captures on @xmath1c .",

    "this also partly explains the observed [ eu / y ] and [ ba / y ] dispersions .",
    "it is noteworthy that fast - rotating massive stars offer a promising nucleosynthesis site for the metal - poor lepp .",
    "for instance , gce predictions that account for fast - rotating weak - s process yields ( @xmath51 line ) move towards the original model with the estimated lepp ( @xmath57 line ) .",
    "although our homogeneous gce model can not provide a realistic representation of the observed s - element dispersion , the averaged gce predictions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] are in agreement with previous results presented by @xcite , who indicated that low - metallicity fast - rotating massive stars may reproduce the [ sr / ba ] inhomogeneities observed in extremely metal - poor stars . + note that large uncertainties affect massive - star models , as discussed by @xcite : on the nuclear point of view , owing to the uncertain @xmath84o+@xmath4 and @xmath41ne+@xmath4 rates , and on the modeling point of view , mainly because of the treatment of the physics associated to magnetic fields and rotation - induced mixing . in the framework of gce models , a more detailed grid of stellar yields may help to better assess an upper limit for the fast - rotating weak - s process contribution .",
    "+ as evidenced by different gce approaches , the chemical enrichment of the stellar halo is likely the result of a merger of different ( primary ) processes , including fast - rotating weak - s process and @xmath40 processes ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also section  [ z ] ) .",
    "we have implemented the study on gce predictions of @xmath0-process elements presented by @xcite by including recent pivotal suggestions provided in literature .",
    "the main result is that the predicted chemical compositions in the interstellar medium at any epoch are grossly independent of the particular @xmath1c profile adopted inside the pocket , once a different weighted average of @xmath1c - pocket strengths is considered to reproduce solar @xmath17sm ( within 5% accuracy ) .",
    "+ the impact of agb uncertainties on gce computations may be partially reduced by assuming a range of @xmath1c - pocket strengths , as indicated by observational constraints .",
    "actually , this approach allows us to obtain more accurate information about the complementary contribution from other nucleosynthesis processes that may compete over the galactic history . in the framework of these @xmath1c - pocket prescriptions , we confirm that the additional lepp - s mechanism invoked by @xcite is required to represent the observed solar distribution within the estimated solar uncertainties . in this view , only 3d or hydrodynamical agb modeling may shed light on the @xmath1c - pocket scenario .",
    "+ updated gce calculations accounting for recent fast - rotating metal - poor weak @xmath0-process yields by @xcite may partially solve the missing contribution to the solar sr - y - zr abundances .",
    "the [ sr / ba ] dispersion observed in the early galaxy may be reconciled with the contribution of metal - poor massive stars with different rotational velocity , in agreement with previous results by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a more detailed grid of stellar yields would help to assess the total @xmath0 contribution . from the present analysis ,",

    "+ in this view , additional processes have to be invoked to explain the observed trends . the intermediate neutron - capture process ( @xmath76 process ) may play a decisive role in the nucleosynthesis of the galaxy ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this issue deserves a more comprehensive analysis in order to establish whether the present discrepancies between gce predictions and the analyzed spectroscopic sample are confirmed by other elements .",
    "future investigations with a more extended and homogeneous data - set of neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , cu , ga , ge , among weak @xmath0 process elements ; mo , ru , ag , pd , for weak @xmath40 process elements ; ce , which is expected to behave as ba ) are planned to distinguish between different nucleosynthesis processes .    the improved quality and statistics of the ongoing surveys ( e.g.",
    ", gaia - eso , segue , rave , apogee , hermes - galah ) will also assure a more solid picture of the galactic sub - structures .",
    "first studies by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite evidenced that stars belonging to the thin and thick discs have different ages , kinematics , locations on the galactic plane , and chemical properties .",
    "although a complex image of the galactic structure emerges from the most recent investigations ( e.g. , perturbation , accretion , merging or heating processes , radial migrations , gas flows ; see the review by @xcite ) , the main features observed in the solar neighborhood are confirmed by several surveys .",
    "for instance , it has been well established in literature that various @xmath4-elements show clear separate behaviors in the thick and the thin disc .",
    "+ in this view , a detailed analysis of our gce prescriptions is required in order to provide an improved representation of the chemical abundances observed in thick / thin disc stars ( see , e.g. , [ o / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] in fig .  1 by @xcite ) .",
    "+ a preliminary study of the main gce ingredients ( e.g. , star formation rate , initial mass function , delay - time distribution function for snia , and the present uncertainties affecting snia stellar yields ) highlights that the theoretical interpretation of the thick / thin disc observed trends is largely affected by the poorly known snia scenario ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) . specifically ,",
    "our gce thick / thin disc predictions may be improved by assuming a factor of 2 uncertainty in the snia stellar yields adopted so far @xcite , coupled with an updated treatment of the delayed - time distribution ( dtd ) function ( as suggested by @xcite ) , in which we assume a dominant snia contribution starting from [ fe / h ] @xmath3 @xmath271 .",
    "+ additionally , distinct enrichment histories of the thick / thin disc components may be obtained by adopting a different star formation rate , with a delayed thin disc phase ( as hypothesized by the two - infall model by @xcite ) . to this purpose",
