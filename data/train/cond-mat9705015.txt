    "neural networks are systems in which a great number of neurons are connected with each other by synapses .",
    "the neurons basically take the two states , i.e. , the firing and non - firing states .",
    "a neuron is firing if stimuli coming from ( thousands of ) neighboring neurons exceed a threshold .",
    "the neuron thus firing in turn affects neighboring neurons .",
    "these features are reminiscent of an ising spin system with long ranged interactions .",
    "hopfield [ 1 ] pointed out that the neural networks can be described by a mathematically equivalent model to that of spin glasses if couplings through synapses are symmetric and random .",
    "this suggests that the various methods developed for spin glasses are applicable to the neural networks .",
    "indeed , numbers of studies have been made on this model since then [ 2 - 5 ] . among others ,",
    "the work made by amit , gutfreund and sompolinsky ( ags ) [ 5 ] is worth noticing . applying the replica method , which is a mathematical trick to calculate the free energy , they investigated the hopfield model to find that it exhibits a feature of the associative memory in a certain region in the @xmath0 plane , where @xmath1 is temperature and @xmath2 is the ratio of the number of stored patterns @xmath3 to that of neurons @xmath4 .",
    "the region is called the retrieval feromagnetic ( fm ) phase .",
    "it was also shown by ags that the model has another ordered phase , called the spin - glass ( sg ) phase , besides a disordered paramagnetic ( pm ) phase at highest temperatures .",
    "sherrington and kirkpatrick [ 6 ] proposed a model for spin glasses ( the sk model ) in which all ising spins are coupled with each other through interactions which are given by independent gaussian random numbers .",
    "the model was introduced to construct the mean - field theory of spin glasses . making use of the replica method",
    ", they obtained various properties of spin glasses .",
    "although the original sk solution involves a difficulty to yield negative entropy at low temperatures , the model is now resolved by the replica - symmetry - breaking solution due to parisi [ 7 ] .",
    "the replica method is successful , but it is rather abstract since , by this method , the average over samples is carried out before examining thermodynamic properties of an individual sample . in order to get more direct physical insights of the sk model , thouless , anderson and palmer ( tap ) [ 8 ] developed the mean - field theory in the phase space ,",
    "by which one first treats an individual sample and then takes the average over samples .",
    "they proposed the free - energy form which contains the effect of the 2-spin cluster besides the terms given by the conventional mean - field theory .",
    "the tap free energy , properly derived afterwards [ 9,10 ] , well works to further clarify various features of spin glasses such as the marginal stability of the sg phase [ 11 ] , the many - valley structure in the free - energy landscape [ 12 ] , the number of local free - energy minima [ 13 ] and so on .",
    "it is now known that the tap free - energy approach and the replica method are consistent with each other and provide complementary understandings of spin glasses [ 14,15 ] .",
    "the present work is motivated to develop such a tap - like approach to the hopfield model which is expected to play roles complementary to the ags replica theory .",
    "such an approach has been already described by mzard , parisi and virasoro ( mpv ) in their text book [ 14 ] .",
    "based on the cavity method , which they have successfully developed to derive the tap equations of states for the sk model , they have proposed the corresponding equations of states for the hopfield model .",
    "we consider , however , that a part of their derivation has remained to be justified .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to derive the tap free - energy expression for the hopfield model directly by following the method due to plefka [ 10 ] , who derived the tap free energy of the sk model .",
    "a crucial difference between the two models is that there exist correlations between different elements of the interaction matrix in the hopfield model [ 14,16 ] , while they are not found in the sk model .",
    "consequently the tap free energy of the former consists of an infinite series of terms exhibiting such correlation ( cluster ) effects . based on the tap free energy derived ,",
    "we analyze mostly nature of the sg phase of the model and compare the results with those obtained by the replica method as well as by the cavity method .",
    "the derived tap free energy is valid also in the retrieval fm phase , but the solution in this phase is left for a future study .    in the next section we present the derivation of the tap free energy of the hopfield model .",
    "the pm - sg transition temperature @xmath5 is calculated in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to some related discussions including comparisons of the present results with those obtained by ags and mpv .",
    "our starting hamiltonian is @xmath6 where @xmath7 denote spin ( neuron ) sites , and @xmath8 stand for spins ( neurons ) and take the values @xmath9 ; the value @xmath10 and @xmath11 correspond to the neuron which is firing and is not firing , respectively . the summation is taken over all spin ( neuron ) pairs .",
    "the interaction ( synaptic efficiencies ) @xmath12 are given by @xmath13{\\rm for } i\\neq j \\\\",
    "0 & \\makebox[3em]{\\rm for } i = j , \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 take @xmath9 and @xmath15 represent the @xmath16-th stored pattern . here",
    "we consider that @xmath14 are quenched , independent and random variables .",
    "this means that @xmath12 are also random variables .",
    "one sees that @xmath12 obey the gaussian distribution with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where the overline indicates the average over samples ( different realizations of @xmath19 , or @xmath15 s ) .",
    "it should be noticed here that @xmath19 are not independent with each other , but have correlations between different @xmath12 s [ 14,16 ] ; for example , we see @xmath20 these non - zero correlations bring about new terms in the free energy ( see below ) .    in order to obtain the free energy ,",
    "we follow plefka [ 10 ] . introducing external fields",
    "@xmath21 , we consider @xmath22 then , we make the legendre transformation to get the free energy as a function of @xmath23 , @xmath24 here @xmath1 is the temperature ( @xmath25 , with @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the expectation value with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "we expand ( 5 ) with respect to @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 and then we put @xmath32 .",
    "plefka showed @xmath33 and obtained @xmath34 where we have introduced @xmath35    now we extend the calculation up to the 4-th order .",
    "this calculation is fairly lengthy ; we have made use of the algebraic programming system reduce-2 .",
    "the results thus obtained are as follows : @xmath36 and @xmath37 { } \\times ( j_{ij}m_im_j+j_{jk}m_jm_k+j_{ki}m_km_i ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & - 24\\beta^3 \\sum_{\\langle i , j , k,\\ell \\rangle}j_{ij}j_{jk}j_{k \\ell}j_{\\ell i}(1-m_i^2)(1-m_j^2)(1-m_k^2)(1-m_\\ell^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above , @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote that the summation should be taken over _ inequivalent _ 3-spin clusters and 4-spin clusters , respectively .",
    "the free energy should be of the order of @xmath4 , and therefore we have only to pick up terms proportional to @xmath4 in ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) , ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) .",
    "for the ferromagnetic weiss model with @xmath40 , we can see that only ( 9 ) gives the contribution proportional to @xmath4 , as it should . in the sk model ,",
    "the interactions @xmath41 obey the simple gaussian distribution with @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and there is no correlation between different @xmath12 s .",
    "therefore , as tap pointed out , equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) give the contribution of the order of @xmath4 . in the hopfield model of present interest ,",
    "equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) are of the order of @xmath4 as in the sk model . as mentioned in section 1 , however , there exist correlations between different @xmath12 s .",
    "this provides new terms to the free energy . to show this , we take the last term of ( 14 ) , as an example .",
    "its order of magnitude is estimated as @xmath44 similarly one can see that the last term of ( 15 ) yields the contribution of @xmath45 . as for the other terms in ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) , one can see that they can be neglected in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "these analyses imply that @xmath47 for @xmath48 also provide the terms of @xmath45 , which are written in the form , @xmath49 their explicit derivation is given in appendix a.    as a result , we have the following free energy , @xmath50 with @xmath51 { } \\times ( 1-m_{i_1}^2)(1-m_{i_2}^2 ) \\cdots(1-m_{i_n}^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second term in ( 19 ) is the entropy , which comes from @xmath52 in ( 6 ) .",

    "one notices at once that @xmath77 exhibits a quite different behavior from that of the independent gaussian random matrix , for which it obeys the semi - circular law [ 11 ] .",
    "this is again the consequence of the non - zero correlations between the different matrix elements . for @xmath78 @xmath77",
    "consists of a delta peak at @xmath79 ( whose amplitude is @xmath80 ) and the continuous distribution @xmath81 around @xmath82 , i.e. , @xmath83 ( whose integrated amplitude is @xmath76 ) .",
    "note that @xmath77 is normalized as @xmath84 . at @xmath85",

    "then we rewrite ( 26 ) to have @xmath88 this leads to @xmath89 .",
    "it is noted that @xmath67 thus obtained is just on the boundary of the condition ( 27 ) , or @xmath5 is given as a double root of ( 26 ) .",
    "these circumstances are the same as those of the spin - glass transition temperature extracted by the tap equation in the sk model .",
    "the spin - glass transition temperature @xmath5 obtained by ( 30 ) coincides with the ags result derived by the replica method .",
    "a further interesting comparison with the ags result is on the expression of the entropy . to show this ,",

    "it becomes negative when it is evaluated in terms of the replica - symmetric solutions [ 5 ] .",
    "an expected proper solution is , as tap argues for the sk model [ 8 ] , that @xmath96 should vanish faster than @xmath1 as @xmath97 because we should have @xmath98 at @xmath99 .    in relation with the present result that @xmath5 is determined as a double root of ( 26 ) ,",
    "let us consider the susceptibility matrix @xmath100 .",
    "it is known that @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the hessian matrix defined by @xmath104 .",
    "then we see that @xmath105 diverges at @xmath5 as @xmath106 , where @xmath105 is the susceptibility of the eigenmode with the largest eigenvalue @xmath67 .",
    "the spin - glass susceptibility defined by @xmath107 is calculated as @xmath108 in the pm phase . since @xmath109 near its upper edge , we obtain @xmath110 .",
    "the replica method can provide the same result .",
    "these results described here indicate that nature of the pm - sg transition in the hopfield model , including that the replica - symmetry - breaking takes place in the sg phase [ 5 ] , is almost identical to that in the sk model .",
    "the tap equations of state for the hopfield model was already discussed by mpv [ 14 ] .",
    "they made use of the cavity method twice .",
    "in the first step , one spin is added to the @xmath4-spin system , and the relations between quantities such as the free energy and the density of states of the @xmath4- and @xmath111-spin systems are examined to determine the distribution of field to the added spin . then the following tap equations are derived @xmath112,\\ ] ] where @xmath113 with @xmath114 . for the sk model",
    "this step alone gives rise to the tap equations of interest [ 14 ] .",
    "for the hopfield model , on the other hand , mpv introduced another ` cavity method ' , in which the relevant relations are those of quantities in the systems where @xmath3 and @xmath115 patterns are stored .",
    "this yields , for the replica - symmetric solution , @xmath116}.\\ ] ] however equation ( 34 ) with ( 35 ) substituted does not coincide with our result , equation ( 22 ) .",
    "since the factor @xmath117 in the numerator of the second term of ( 22 ) is missing , the mpv equations do not reproduce the proper @xmath5 .",
    "we suppose that the origin of the discrepancy would lie in the second step of the cavity method in the mpv argument .",
    "finally we make a comment on the work by geszti [ 2 ] .",
    "starting from the equations @xmath118 , he derived a set of the self - consistent equations for the retrieval fm order parameter @xmath119 , the random overlap parameter @xmath120 , and @xmath91 , which coincides with those due to ags derived by the replica theory . in his heuristic argument , however , the terms in ( 21 ) coming from @xmath90 of ( 20 ) are ignored .",
    "his argument is similar to the one by which the self - consistent equation for @xmath91 of the sk model is derived , and which is criticized in [ 15 ] .",
    "a proper solution of ( 21 ) in the retrieval fm phase is our next concern .    to conclude we have developed a tap - like mean - field theory on the hopfield model , by which we first analyze thermodynamics of individual sample with fixed @xmath41 , or @xmath121 s and",
    "then take the average over samples .",
    "in contrast to the sk model for spin glasses where only the 2-spin cluster effect is vital , it has been shown that a series of clusters , composing a large number of spins , play an important role in the hopfield model .",
    "this gives rise to the tap free energy which contains an infinite number of terms .",
    "based on it we have investigated the pm - sg transition in the hopfield model to find that its nature is almost identical to that in the sk model .",
    "we consider that the present tap free - energy approach is useful in studying neural networks of a mean - field type since it will provide us complementary information to the replica method .",
    "here we discuss @xmath122 , from which we have terms of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "we notice that the last terms of ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) come from the last terms of ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , respectively .",
    "therefore we concentrate , in @xmath122 , on the term @xmath123 it is easily seen that @xmath122 contains the above term if one notices @xmath124 on the other hand , we have @xmath125 and therefore ( a1 ) can be written by @xmath126^{n-1 } \\right\\rangle_a.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this provides equation ( 17 ) in the text , together with other irrelevant terms .",
