    "quantum correlations , seminally quantified by the quantum discord @xcite , stand as one of the most general manifestations of nonclassicality in composite systems . they can be revealed in the process of locally measuring a subsystem , even in states where entanglement or nonlocality are absent . despite a massive surge in recent studies investigating interpretation , quantification , and applications of discord and related quantifiers of quantum correlations @xcite , it is a fact that these quantities remain far less understood than entanglement @xcite .",
    "few properties are now set in stone as necessary requirements to identify a quantifier , say @xmath0 , as a _ bona fide _ measure of general quantum correlations , revealed on the subsystem @xmath1 , in bipartite states @xmath2 .",
    "we list them below :    _ p1 .",
    "_  vanishing on classical - quantum ( cq ) states : @xmath3 for all @xmath2 and @xmath4 for all states @xmath5 belonging to the set @xmath6 of cq states , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 being a probability distribution , @xmath9 an orthonormal basis for subsystem @xmath1 , and @xmath10 arbitrary states for subsystem @xmath11 ;    _ p2 .",
    "_  invariance under local unitaries : @xmath12 ;    _ p3 . _  nonincreasing under local operations on the unmeasured party @xmath11 : @xmath13\\big ) \\leq { \\cal q}(\\rho_{ab})$ ] , where @xmath14 is a completely positive and trace preserving map ( i.e. , a quantum channel ) acting on subsystem @xmath11 ;    _ p4 . _",
    "reduction to entanglement on pure states : @xmath15 is an entanglement monotone @xcite .",
    "these criteria are certainly not complete , as in particular a definition of the operations on @xmath1 , or of the allowed classical communication between @xmath1 and @xmath11 , under which discord and any valid @xmath0 should not increase , has not been accomplished @xcite . in the quest to unveil the most essential signatures of quantumness in complex systems , it is then of wide interest to identify physically insightful properties that underly the notion of quantum correlations as opposed to entanglement , and should then be reflected by any valid measure thereof .",
    "one such property is , for instance , the absence of monogamy @xcite .",
    "this area of investigation has also a strong technological motivation @xcite : it is believed , and in some case proven , that states with quantum correlations other than entanglement can be employed as resources for several quantum computation @xcite , communication @xcite , and metrology setups @xcite .",
    "identifying the distinctive traits of such correlations , in particular with respect to their resilience under noise , might lead to valuable recipes for their practical exploitation .",
    "numerous works have in fact investigated the dynamics of general quantum correlations in open quantum systems undergoing various types of markovian or non - markovian evolutions , as recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "one evident feature is that discord is typically more robust than entanglement and does not suffer from sudden death issues @xcite ; discord can even be created by local operations on the measured party @xmath1 ( nonunital channels if @xmath1 is a qubit ) @xcite .",
    "a particularly fascinating phenomenon can occur for two - qubit states undergoing nondissipative decoherence : their discord can remain constant , or _ frozen _ , for an interval of time in markovian conditions @xcite . a forever frozen discord @xcite , or multiple intervals of recurring frozen discord @xcite , can further occur when the dynamics is non - markovian .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions for the freezing have been derived in @xcite . however , to date such a feature seemed bound to the choice of particular ( mainly entropic ) quantifiers of discord @xcite .",
    "it is natural to question whether freezing just happens as a mathematical accident , or whether it bears a deeper physical meaning which should manifest independently of the adopted measure .",
    "answering this question is the purpose of our work .",
    "we consider a selection of essentially all the known _ bona fide _ measures of general quantum correlations defined in recent literature , and we find that they _ all _ freeze under the same dynamical conditions .",
    "a geometric analysis , inspired by @xcite , is carried out in order to provide a satisfactory interpretation to the universality of this dynamical phenomenon .",
    "our conclusions demonstrate that for all quantum information protocols ( e.g.  remote state preparation , entanglement distribution , or quantum correlations - assisted parameter estimation @xcite ) whose performance relies on some form of discord between two qubits , however quantified , there exist unique noisy evolutions in the state space for which coherence and thus quantumness in the correlations are exactly preserved .",
    "the corresponding protocols will then run with efficiency unaffected by such noisy conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ secbell ]",
    "we briefly recall the description of bell diagonal states of two qubits . in section  [ secdm ]",
    "we present a comprehensive compendium of the measures of nonclassical correlations studied in this work .",
    "section  [ secu ] demonstrates that all the considered measures froze under specifical nondissipative dynamical trajectories . in section  [ secg ]",
    "we present a geometric interpretation of the phenomenon .",
    "discussions and conclusion are provided in section  [ secc ] , while some technical proofs are deferred to appendices .",
    "we focus our attention to bell diagonal ( bd ) states of two qubits , i.e. , states with maximally mixed marginals @xcite . their density matrix can be written in bloch form as @xmath16 where @xmath17 denote the pauli matrices and the vector @xmath18 completely specifies the state .    explicitly , @xmath19 as the name suggests , bd states @xmath20 have the four maximally entangled bell states as eigenvectors , with eigenvalues @xmath21\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 . the conditions @xmath23 impose constraints on the entries of @xmath24 , so that physically allowed bd states can be represented as points within a tetrahedron of vertices @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the three - dimensional space spanned by @xmath29 @xcite",

    "bd states with zero discord correspond then to @xmath34 .",
    "we study one - way measures @xmath35 of discord , that is , those which reveal quantumness of correlations as perceived by an observer probing only qubit @xmath1 . incidentally ,",
    "whenever symmetrized versions of these measures are available @xcite , they coincide with their one - way counterparts for bd states , thus enlarging the scope of our study .",
    "the adopted measures , which include those reviewed in @xcite , others taken from recent literature , and some defined or calculated here for the first time , are listed in the following @xcite . most of these measures do not enjoy a closed analytical form in general , but are computable for bd states . notice that pairs of distinct quantifiers selected from our list will generically induce inequivalent orderings on the set of non - cq states , even within the bd class @xcite .",
    "the original measure of quantum discord @xcite can be defined as the minimum difference in total correlations between the state @xmath37 and the cq state obtained after an optimized projective measurement @xmath38 on @xmath1 , @xmath39 $ ] . here",

    "this measure @xcite quantifies , in a thermodynamical framework , the minimum entropy production after a projective measurement on @xmath1 , @xmath47 $ ] .",

    "the geometric discord @xmath54 was defined in @xcite as the minimum squared hilbert - schmidt distance from the set @xmath55 .",
    "however , it is now acknowledged that such a definition is flawed @xcite , as @xmath54 can be modified arbitrarily by reversible operations on @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , @xmath54 does not respect _",
    "it is customary , when dealing with the hilbert - schmidt distance , to normalize it by the purity of the state , in order to correct the metric for the effective dimension of the hilbert space @xcite .",

    "properties and applications of this measure are discussed in @xcite . for bd states , using @xcite we have @xmath58 .",
    "as the name suggests , this measure @xcite is given by the minimum trace distance from the set of cq states , @xmath60 , with @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "for bd states , such a measure is computable @xcite and one has simply @xmath62 .",
    "this measure @xcite corresponds to the minimum negativity ( an entanglement measure @xcite ) created between the system @xmath64 and an apparatus @xmath65 during a local projective measurement on @xmath1 , according to the formalism of @xcite . referring the reader to @xcite for details",
    ", we recall that if subsystem @xmath1 is a qubit ( as in our case ) , then @xmath66 .",
    "we can consider the bures distance from the set of cq states as another measure of discord , in analogy with the bures measure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "we then have @xmath68^{\\frac12}$ ] , where @xmath69 and @xmath70\\big\\}^2 $ ] is the uhlmann fidelity @xcite . for bd states , in appendix a we obtain an analytical expression for @xmath71 ( see @xcite for an independent yet related derivation ) .",
    "we notice that , for a given @xmath20 , the cq state which maximizes the fidelity is in general different from the one which minimizes trace distance , hilbert - schmidt distance , and relative entropy .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath72 $ ] , where @xmath73 denotes cyclic permutations of @xmath32 .      as a simple rescaling of the previous quantity",
    ", we also pick the geometric measure of quantumness discussed in @xcite , which in our notation reads @xmath75 $ ] , and is computable for bd states using the expression for @xmath71 given above .",
    "the last measure we adopt , which is also the most recently introduced @xcite , quantifies the minimum quantum uncertainty on a single local observable , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a hermitian operator with nondegenerate spectrum acting on subsystem @xmath1 , and @xmath79 $ ] is the wigner - yanase skew information @xcite . the quantity @xmath76 is computable for all two - qubit states @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find that for bd states @xmath80 , although the two measures do not coincide in general .",
    "we consider local markovian nondissipative decoherence channels acting independently on each of two qubits @xmath81 in the state @xmath2 .",
    "the single - qubit lindblad operator has the form @xmath82=\\frac{\\gamma}{2 } \\big(\\sigma_k^m \\rho_m \\sigma_k^m - \\rho_m\\big),\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the decoherence rate and @xmath84 denote bit flip , bit - phase flip , and phase flip ( alias phase damping ) channels , respectively @xcite .",
    "we consider bd states @xmath85 as inputs .",
    "the time - evolved states under the considered local channels remain in bd form , with @xmath86 where @xmath87 selects the channel as explained above .",
    "different initial conditions @xmath88 lead to varied dynamics of nonclassical correlations , without any general agreement between the measures we consider .",
    "however , for each selected channel , indexed by @xmath87 , we can choose a specific subset of initial conditions @xmath89 @xcite , given by @xmath90 ( notice that taking into account the sign freedom and the permutation of @xmath91 there are four possible choices per channel ) .",
    "these conditions , which are equivalent to imposing that the density matrix be of rank @xmath92 , give rise to very peculiar dynamics of the quantum correlations in the time - evolved states @xmath93 under the corresponding @xmath87-type channels .",
    "namely , defining the threshold time @xmath94 , we find analytically that every measure @xmath0 considered in this paper takes the form @xmath95 this entails that _ all _ studied measures of discord remain _ frozen _ to their initial value until , at @xmath96 , they suddenly start decaying exponentially , as depicted in fig .",

    "[ tablef ] [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the presented results , although tied to the particular choices of channels and initial states , apply to such a variety of measures of discord that the level of mere coincidence can be safely considered overcome .",
    "we now seek for a physical explanation of our findings .",
    "most of our employed measures , in the chosen settings , can be interpreted as minimal distances from the set of cq states .",
    "it turns out that , for nondissipative evolutions with initial condition as in eq .",
    "( [ rihanna ] ) , all our distance functions are optimized by the same time - dependent cq state ( explicitly given in @xcite ) .",
    "this certainly explains why all such measures have a sudden change at the same time @xmath96 , but does not explain why all of them are in fact _ constant _ for earlier times .",
    "for instance , without the purity adjustment , the geometric discord @xmath54 @xcite decreases rather than being frozen when @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "the adjusted @xmath99 instead freezes like the other measures . as remarked earlier , the purity adjustment is necessary to correct for some flaws of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the occurrence of freezing is , at a somewhat empirical level , a stronger feature which necessitates to be present in truly _ bona fide _",

    ", one can draw the surfaces along which each given measure @xmath0 is constant , and then superimpose the trajectories corresponding , say , to the evolution of @xmath108 under local @xmath87-channels , in order to visualize the freezing .",
    "let us focus , without loss of generality , on phase flip channels @xmath109 .",
    "for ease of graphical display , instead of drawing three - dimensional surfaces , we find it more informative to slice the tetrahedron of bd states at , say , a constant value of @xmath110 , and draw the contours of constant @xmath0 in the resulting projected plane spanned by @xmath100 . this analysis is reported in fig .",
    "[ sconcia ] for several types of discord measures .",
    "it is evident that the various quantifiers exhibit their quite different nature even within the restricted set of bd states .",
    "in particular , around the classical states at the centre @xmath111 , contours of constant quantum correlations are ellipses for entropic ( @xmath112 ) and fidelity - based ( @xmath113 ) measures , while they are circles for the hilbert - schmidt based @xmath99 , and squares for the trace - distance based @xmath59 . similarly , closer to the peripheral boundaries of the physically allowed region , the contour lines have different topologies across the various measures . some measures like",
    "@xmath59 are constant for wider regions than the others , for instance . here",
    "we are interested in the overlap between the contour lines of all @xmath0 s .",
    "we find ( see appendix b ) that the only possible straight lines , in the bd state space , which keep _ all _ the considered measures simultaneously constant , are those along the diagonals of the projected rectangles in the space @xmath100 , stopping sufficiently far away from the central core ( see fig .  [ sconcia ] ) .",
    "these segments describe only and precisely the evolutions of bd states with initial conditions @xmath104 [ eq .  ( [ rihanna ] ) ] for local phase flip channels  and similarly for the other @xmath87-channels by selecting the corresponding planes @xmath114 and conditions @xmath89up to the time @xmath115 .",
    "this yields a general _ geometric interpretation _ to the phenomenon of frozen discord universally observed in all valid measures at once .",
    "we wish to remark that , in the presence of suitable non - markovian channels which can be described by a master equation with a memory kernel ( as in the case of pure dephasing or decoherence under classical random external fields ) @xcite , all the phenomena previously observed for the entropic discord @xmath36 extend automatically to all the measures considered in this paper .",
    "indeed , in the models of @xcite , the evolution of bd states can be formally written as in eq .",
    "( [ evolvc ] ) , but with @xmath116 replaced by a more general @xmath117 , which could be decreasing over some time intervals .",
    "this can give rise to dynamics with multiple intervals of constant discord @xcite , or discord frozen forever @xcite depending on the initial conditions . by our analysis",
    ", we conclude that those features , which might be observable e.g.  in the dynamics of impurity atoms in bose - einstein condensates @xcite , are universal too and detectable by any suitable discord measure @xmath0 .",

    "originally revealed for entropic quantifiers @xcite , we showed that this feature is common to all _ bona fide _ measures of discord , and we provided a geometric interpretation thereof .",
    "it will be interesting to investigate , when the theory of discord @xcite is completed , whether the occurrence of freezing in nondissipative evolutions will perhaps be provable as an implication of the set of necessary conditions for assessing the mathematical validity of measures of discord . at present , the occurrence of freezing in specific nondissipative evolutions can be proposed as a ` sanity check ' to validate novel discord quantifiers . from an operative perspective",
    ", we showed that quantumness of correlations , in all its manifold manifestations , can be sustained with no loss in suitable noisy settings .",
