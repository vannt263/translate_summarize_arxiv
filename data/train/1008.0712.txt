    "the presence of an important extra line broadening mechanism ( in addition to the rotational broadening and usually called @xmath0 ) affecting the spectra of o and b supergiants ( sgs ) was initially suggested by the deficit of narrow lined objects among these types of stars ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the advent of high - quality spectra permitted confirmation that rotational broadening alone is insufficient to fit the line profiles in many objects , and to investigate the possible disentangling of both broadening contributions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies definitely showed that the effect of macroturbulence is dominant in the profiles of metal lines in early bsgs .",
    "although it was named macroturbulence at some point , the interpretation of this extra broadening as the effect of turbulent motion is quite improbable .",
    "the effect is present in photospheric lines and affects the whole profile , even wavelengths close to the continuum .",
    "therefore , whatever is producing the extra broadening has to be deeply rooted in the stellar photosphere ( and possibly deeper ) , in layers where we do not expect any significant velocity field in these stars .",
    "if interpreted as turbulent motion , macroturbulence would represent _ highly supersonic _ velocities in many cases ( see figure [ f0 ] ) .",
    "this interpretation is incompatible with the previous statement .",
    "one physical mechanism suggested as the origin of this extra broadening relates to oscillations .",
    "many obsgs are known to show photometric and spectroscopic variability .",
    "based on this , @xcite postulated that this variability might be a pulsation phenomenon , and macroturbulence may be identified with the surface motions generated by the superposition of numerous non - radial oscillations .",
    "more recently , @xcite computed time series of line profiles for evolved massive stars broadened by rotation and thousands of low amplitude non - radial gravity mode oscillations and showed that the resulting profiles could mimic the observed ones . in their paper , aerts et al .",
    "( 2009 ) considered the amplitudes of the pulsation modes to be sufficiently low to allow a linear superposition of mode velocities to derive the overall pulsational velocity eigenvector , i.e. , nonlinear mode coupling or other nonlinear effects were ignored .",
    "we refer the reader to sect . 2.1 in @xcite for a detailed description of the simulations , and a discussion about how the collective effect of low amplitude non - radial gravity modes can produce the inferred supersonic level of macroturbulent broadening when the oscillations are ignored in the interpretation of spectral lines .",
    "stellar oscillations are a plausible explanation for the extra broadening in o and b sgs , but so far there is no direct observational evidence confirming this hypothesis .",
    "two years ago we began an observational project aimed at investigating the macroturbulent broadening in o and b sgs , and its possible connection with spectroscopic variability phenomena and stellar oscillations . in this letter , we present the first encouraging results , showing observational evidence for a strong correlation between this extra broadening and photospheric line profile variations in a sample of 13 sgs with spectral types ranging from o9 to b8 .",
    "the letter is structured as follows : the sample of stars and the spectroscopic observations used for this study are presented in sect .",
    "[ observations ] ; we characterize the line - broadening and the line - profile variations of photospheric lines in sects . [ broadening ] and",
    "[ signatures ] , respectively ; a connection between the extra broadening and line profile variations is presented in sect .",
    "[ connection ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the possible relation to stellar pulsations in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we obtained time series spectra of a selected sample of 11 bright late - o and early - b sgs during two observing runs ( 2008/11/05 - 08 , 2009/11/09 - 12 ) with the fies cross - dispersed high resolution echelle spectrograph on the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope at roque de los muchachos observatory on la palma ( canary islands , spain ) .",
    "we used fies in the medium resolution mode ( r=46000 , @xmath1=0.03  / pix ) .",
    "the sample was complemented with two ob dwarfs and two late b sgs .",
    "the exposure times were chosen so as to reach at least snr=200 ( measured in the range 45004600  ) .",
    "the list of observed stars , along with their spectral classification , number of spectra obtained for each target , timespan of the corresponding time - series , and observing run in which they were observed are indicated in the first columns of table [ t1 ] .",
    "note that four of these stars were observed in both campaigns .",
    "the spectra were reduced with the fiestool package in advanced mode .",
    "a proper set of bias , flat and arc frames obtained each night was used to this aim .",
    "the fiestool pipeline provided wavelength - calibrated , blaze - corrected , order - merged spectra of high quality .",
    "next , the barycentric correction was performed .",
    "we used the interstellar ddoublet at 5890   to check the accuracy in this correction , and found an agreement in the line doublet position for all the time series spectra of each star better than 0.5 kms@xmath2 .",
    "once the lines of interest for this study were identified , a local normalization of selected regions of the spectra was performed . for each line , the local continuum used for the normalization was calculated from a linear fit between points inside two continuum regions adjacent to the line .",
    "the same continuum windows ( selected manually in the average spectrum ) were used for all the spectra of a given star .",
    "several types of broadening mechanisms are traditionally considered to produce the final observed line profiles of photospheric metal lines in massive stars : instrumental , natural , thermal , microturbulent , macroturbulent and rotational broadening . in the case of high resolution6.5 kms@xmath2 . ]",
    "spectra of late - o and early bsgs , rotational and macroturbulent constributions dominate .",
    "we used the fourier transform technique ( @xcite @xcite ; see also @xcite , @xcite for a recent application to the spectra of o and b stars ) to disentangle the contributions from rotational and macroturbulent broadening .",
    "the results of the analysis are presented in table [ t1 ] .",
    "we performed the analysis for each of the time series spectra , obtaining @xmath3sin@xmath4  as indicated by the first zero of the fourier transform .",
    "the range and median of derived @xmath3sin@xmath4  values are indicated in columns 6 and 7 of table [ t1 ] .",
    "note that the dispersion in the obtained @xmath3sin@xmath4  values is between 10% and 30% , depending on the star .",
    "whether this dispersion is real or an effect of noise is not clear from this dataset . as outlined by @xcite , the correct identification of the first zero is complicated in cases of low snr and for a large extra broadening contribution .",
    "this will be explored in more detail in a future investigation .",
    "next , we applied a goodness - of - fit method ( viz .",
    "* ) to quantify the contribution of the extra broadening in each spectrum from the time series .",
    "we considered as free parameters the equivalent width , the radial velocity , @xmath3sin@xmath4 , and the parameter defining the extra broadening .",
    "we allowed @xmath3sin@xmath4  to vary in the fitting process in order to compare with results from the ft analysis .",
    "two possibilities for the characterization of the extra broadening were considered : an isotropic gaussian profile , and a gaussian radial ",
    "tangential one ( @xmath5 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the latter",
    ", we assumed that the radial and tangential components provide equal contributions to the final profile .",
    "the analysis using an isotropic gaussian profile for the macroturbulent broadening resulted in ( a ) a large dispersion in the @xmath3sin@xmath4  values obtained from the various spectra in each time series ; ( b ) systematically lower @xmath3sin@xmath4  values than those determined through the ft method ( a factor of 0.5 in many cases , sometimes even `` zero '' rotation ) for all stars with dominant extra broadening . on the other hand , when assuming a gaussian radial  tangential profile , we found that ( a ) the dispersion in the @xmath3sin@xmath4  and @xmath5 values was rather low ; ( b ) differences between the @xmath3sin@xmath4  values obtained from the goodness - of - fit method and using the ft technique are @xmath6@xmath720% .",
    "we thus conclude that a gaussian radial ",
    "tangential profile is better suited to characterizing the extra line broadening than an isotropic gaussian profile .",
    "the corresponding mean and standard deviation for @xmath3sin@xmath4  and @xmath5 as obtained from the @xmath8 fit are indicated in columns 8 and 9 in table [ t1 ] .",
    "note the good agreement in the derived values for the four stars observed in both 2008 and 2009 .",
    "similarly to previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we found that the size of the extra broadening is generally larger than the rotational contribution in all the sgs .",
    "this is not the case for the b0.5v star hd37042 , where the total broadening is mainly produced by the effect of the stellar rotation ( note , however , that a certain extra broadening is also needed in this case ) .",
    "the other dwarf star , hd214680 , is a special case , since it has very low @xmath3sin@xmath4 .",
    "for such a low @xmath3sin@xmath4  values , microturbulence produces a significant contribution to the total broadening , which then is included in the measured extra broadening .",
    "note that this argument may also explain the extra broadening needed for hd37042 ( and the other two late - b sgs with low @xmath3sin@xmath4 ) .",
    "in agreement with earlier studies of spectroscopic variability in o and b sgs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) , we found clear signatures of line profile variations ( lpvs ) for all the sgs considered in our sample . to investigate these lpvs",
    "quantitatively we computed the first , @xmath9 , and third , @xmath10 , normalized velocity moments ( for definitions , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the 4567 or 5592 lines with famias @xcite .",
    "these moments are related to the centroid velocity and the skewness of the line profile , respectively , and are well suited for deciding whether an observed line profile is subject to time - dependent line asymmetry ( note that their values are zero for purely symmetric profiles ) .",
    "four representative examples of the temporal behavior of the first and third velocity moments are presented in fig.[f1 ] .",
    "the associated uncertainties ( not included in the plot ) are @xmath110.1 - 0.4 kms@xmath2 , and @xmath1110004000 km@xmath12s@xmath13 , respectively . in the case of the dwarf star hd37042 ,",
    "the @xmath9 values are fairly constant and close to zero .",
    "the maximum dispersion in velocity for this star is @xmath111 kms@xmath2 , of the order of the accuracy associated with the instrumental setting used for the fies@not observations ( indicated as dashed horizontal lines ) .",
    "all the other stars in figure [ f1 ] show @xmath9 variations above this significance level , with maximum peak - to - peak amplitudes reaching @xmath111012 kms@xmath2  in some of the cases .",
    "the minimum variations are found for hd214680 ( the other luminosity class v object considered in this study ) , hd191243 ( b5ib ) and hd190603 ( b1.5ia@xmath14 ) , with maximum amplitudes slightly larger than the significance level .",
    "curiously , the star hd190603 , expected to be an extreme object from its spectral classification , is one of the cases with smaller variations .",
    "we indicate in table [ t1 ] ( columns 10 and 11 ) the peak - to - peak amplitude of the first and third moment variations measured for each of the considered targets .",
    "we investigate the possible connection between macroturbulent broadening and lpvs in our sample of stars .",
    "such a connection should appear in case macroturbulent broadening is produced by any time - dependent physical phenomena ( e.g. non - radial oscillations , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in fig.[f2",
    "] ( upper pannels ) , we plot the average size of the macroturbulent broadening , @xmath15 , versus the peak - to - peak amplitude of @xmath9 and @xmath10 variations for each of the stars studied . results from the four stars observed in both campaigns are conected with solid lines .",
    "a clear positive correlation is present in both cases . to our knowledge , this is the _ first clear observational evidence for a connection between extra broadening and lpvs in b and late o sgs . _",
    "particularly remarkable is the @xmath5-@xmath10 correlation : the larger the extra broadening , the more asymmetric line profiles can be found in the time series .",
    "note that this does not mean that lines with a significant macroturbulence contribution are always asymmetric since @xmath10 oscillates between positive and negative values over time .",
    "we also present in fig.[f2 ] ( bottom pannels ) similar plots with data from table 1 in @xcite , based on simulations of line profiles broadened by rotation and by hundreds of low amplitude non - radial gravity mode pulsations .",
    "these simulations consider various combinations of the inclination angle ( @xmath4 ) , the projected rotational velocity ( @xmath3sin@xmath4 ) , and the intrinsic amplitude of the modes denoted by @xmath16 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a definition ) .",
    "we present the maximum values of v@xmath17 obtained for each set of simulated profiles .",
    "similar trends for @xmath18 as in fig.[f2 ] are found using average or minimum values for the macroturbulence parameter , but with a different ( smaller ) scale in the y - axis .",
    "the simulations lead to clear trends which are compatible with spectroscopic observations .    ) and the peak - to - peak amplitude of the first and third moments of the line - profile.(bottom ) similar relations are found from the simulations by @xcite.,width=302 ]",
    "non - radial oscillations have been often suggested as the origin of lpvs and photosperic lines in ob sgs , as well as the driver of large scale wind structures ( see references in sect.[signatures ] ) ; however , a firm confirmation ( by means of a rigorous seismic analysis ) has not been achieved yet . from a theoretical point of view , g - mode oscillations were not initially expected in bsgs because the radiative damping in the core was suspected as being too strong .",
    "@xcite detected simultaneous p- and g - modes in hd163899 ( b2ib / ii ) using data from the most satellite .",
    "these authors also computed new models showing that g - modes can be excited in massive post - main sequence stars , as the g - modes are reflected at the convective zone associated with the h - burning shell .",
    "@xcite presented observational evidence of g - mode instabilities in a sample of photometrically variable bsgs from the location of the stars in the ( log@xmath19 , logt@xmath20)-diagram .",
    "these results , along with our observational confirmation of a tight connection between macroturbulence and parameters describing observed lpvs render stellar oscillations the most probable physical origin of macroturbulent broadening in bsgs ; however , it is too premature to consider them as the only physical phenomenon to explain the unknown broadening .",
    "recent studies of high resolution spectra of ob stars indicate that the appearance of a significant macroturbulent broadening contribution is not only limited to b sgs but occurs also in o stars of all luminosity classes @xcite as well as in main - sequence b - type pulsators ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , with the recent discovery of a strange - mode oscillation in the b6ia supergiant hd46005 @xcite and of stochastic oscillations in the o8v star hd46149 @xcite and the @xmath21cephei star v1449aql @xcite from high - precision space photometry , observational evidence of atmosphere phenomena due to oscillations , which _ must _ cause some level of pulsational broadening , is growing .",
    "future investigations of the correlation between lpvs and macroturbulence , and its connection to stellar oscillations in the whole realm of massive stars , will be key to establishing the role played by the different physical processes contributing to the spectral line formation in these types of stars",
    ". different models including various combinations of pulsational , rotational and wind effects should be considered , keeping in mind that an appropriate physical mechanism must be able to explain the observed correlation presented in this study .",
