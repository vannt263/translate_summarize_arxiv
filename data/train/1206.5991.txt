    "m dwarfs have become targets of choice for many exoplanet surveys .",
    "this is because low - mass planets ( i.e. earth- to neptune - size ) are easier to detect by the doppler or transit techniques around stars of lower mass .",
    "the transits of smaller planets are also easier to detect when they occur in the also smaller m dwarfs .",
    "in addition , m dwarfs have much lower luminosities than the sun , and their `` habitable zones '' ( hz ) are closer in , which makes transits more likely to occur and radial velocity variations easier to detect for planets in their hz .",
    "earth - like planets within the hz of m dwarfs are thus eminently more detectable with current observational techniques than earth - like planets in the hz of g dwarfs @xcite .",
    "m dwarfs are also the most plentiful class of stars , constituting the largest fraction ( @xmath9 ) of main sequence objects in the galaxy and in the vicinity of the sun @xcite .",
    "however , even nearby m dwarfs are generaly faint at the visible wavelengths where most planet searches are conducted , and most exoplanet detection techniques  with the notable exception of micro - lensing @xcite ",
    "are currently restricted to relatively bright stars .",
    "this significantly limits the number of m dwarfs that can be targeted in exoplanet surveys .",
    "doppler searches in particular are usually restricted to stars with visual magnitudes @xmath10 , and less than @xmath1110% of late - k and early - m stars within 30  pc are currently being monitored by the large - scale doppler surveys @xcite .",
    "however , new surveys are pushing this limit to fainter magnitudes @xcite , and high - resolution spectrographs suitable for doppler observations at near - infrared wavelengths , where m dwarfs are relatively brighter , are being developed @xcite . in any case , only a fraction of all catalogued , nearby m dwarfs are bright enough to be included in radial - velocity monitoring programs",
    ".    transit surveys , on the other hand , can include much fainter stars @xcite .",
    "however , because they have a much lower detection efficiency due to orbital inclination constraints , they require extensive lists ( thousands ) of targets in order to detect any significant number of transit events . for transit surveys ,",
    "the solar neighborhood census and its estimated @xmath125,000 m dwarfs is therefore too small , and transit programs would greatly benefit from extending their target lists to much larger distance limits .    a fundamental obstacle to progress has been the lack of a large , complete , and uniform catalog of bright m dwarfs suitable as targets for exoplanet programs . in particular ,",
    "most catalogs and surveys of m dwarfs have focused on identifying the nearest objects , which are not necessarily the brightest . whereas the hipparcos catalog @xcite provides a near - complete census of solar - mass stars within 100 parsecs of the sun , the bright magnitude limit of the catalog excludes all but the very nearest m dwarfs ",
    "although it lists stars as faint as @xmath13 , the hipparcos catalog is complete only to @xmath14 .",
    "the widely utilized _ third catalog of nearby stars _ , or cns3 @xcite , which lists @xmath123,800 stars , though predating the hipparcos survey , has historically provided a more complete list of m dwarf candidates in the solar neighborhood .",
    "many of the fainter stars in the cns3 have ( ground - based ) parallax measurements from a variety of sources @xcite . however , the cns3 was largely compiled based on a photometric analysis the high proper motion stars catalogued by @xcite , and in large part using photometric data collected by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the cns3 has been largely used in recent years to select m dwarf targets for exoplanet surveys @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the catalog suffers from various sources of incompleteness .",
    "these mainly consist of : ( 1 ) limited availability of quality data for stars in the luyten catalogs , at the time the cns3 was compiled , ( 2 ) kinematic bias in the luyten catalog due a relatively high ( @xmath15 yr@xmath2 ) proper motion limit at the low end , and ( 3 ) incompleteness of the luyten catalogs even for stars with proper motions above the fiducial limit .    motivated mainly by the need to complete the census of the solar neighborhood ,",
    "several surveys have since been conducted to identify the low - mass stars ( mostly m dwarfs ) suspected to be missing from the cns3 .",
    "these have included a re - analysis of the proper motion catalogs of @xcite in light of high quality photometric data provided by the 2mass survey @xcite .",
    "this has led to the identification of hundreds of additional nearby star candidates that had previously been overlooked @xcite .",
    "in addition , cross - matching against 2mass and examination of digitized sky survey images has uncovered significant ( @xmath16 ) errors in many of the coordinates quoted in the luyten catalogs , which was hitherto preventing efficient follow - up studies @xcite .",
    "parallelling these efforts , new proper motion surveys have been conducted , mainly to find the high proper motion stars missing from the luyten catalogs with a focus on completing the stellar census of the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "in addition , some surveys have also been reaching to lower proper motion limits @xcite , potentially extending the census of m dwarfs to larger distances .",
    "recently , we have analyzed data from thesuperblink proper motion survey , which has a proper motion limit @xmath17 yr@xmath2 , with an emphasis on the identification of _ bright _ m dwarfs , rather than just _ nearby _ ones ; our search has turned up 8,889 candidate m dwarfs with infrared magnitude @xmath18 @xcite . of these",
    ", we found that only 982 were previously listed in the hipparcos catalog , and another 898 in the cns3 .",
    "most of the other 7009 stars were not commonly known objects , and were identified as probable nearby m dwarfs for the first time . with its high estimated completeness , especially in the northern sky , the @xcite census provides a solid basis for assembling an extensive and highly complete catalog of bright m dwarfs , suitable for exoplanet search programs .",
    "not all m dwarfs , however , are equally suitable targets for planet searches .",
    "some m dwarfs have significant photometric variability ( flares , spots ) which are affecting transit searches @xcite ; some display chromospheric emission affecting doppler searches @xcite .",
    "because m dwarfs are relatively faint stars , they often require considerable investement of observing time on large telescopes to achieve exoplanet detection , and there is value in identifying subsets of m dwarfs that are intrinsically more likely to host detectable planets @xcite .",
    "in particular , one might be interested in selecting stars of higher metallicity which may harbor more massive planets @xcite , or young stars with relatively luminous massive planets which would be easier to detect through direct imaging @xcite .",
    "in addition , one would like to avoid possible contaminants ( e.g. background giants ) or problematic systems ( e.g. very active stars ) in order to optimize exoplanet survey efficiencies .",
    "determining physical properties of the m dwarfs is also important in order to better characterize the local populations of low - mass stars .",
    "this is especially true since proximity makes them brighter and thus more efficient targets for follow - up observations and detailed study .",
    "some of the bright m dwarfs may be close enough ( d@xmath1920pc ) to warrant inclusion in the parallax programs devoted to completing the census of low - mass stars in the solar neighborhood @xcite , in which case it is also important that the candidates first be vetted through spectral typing .",

    "the survey has notably provided formal spectral classification for 1,971 of the fainter cns3 stars , confirming 1,648 of them to be nearby m dwarfs .",
    "more recent spectroscopic follow - up surveys have mainly focused on candidate nearby stars missing from the cns3 .",
    "very high proper motion stars from the luyten catalogs @xcite , or stars discovered in the more recent proper motion surveys @xcite have thus been targeted .",
    "most notably , the `` meet the cool neighbours '' program ( hereafter mcn ) has determined spectral subtypes for several hundred m dwarfs identified from the luyten catalogs but not listed in the cns3 @xcite . as with the other more recent surveys , the mcn program placed an emphasis on the identification and classification of nearby , very - cool m dwarfs , most of which are however relatively faint and unsuitable for exoplanet surveys .",
    "it should be noted that while large numbers of m dwarfs have also been identified and classified as part of the spectroscopic follow - up program of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , most of them are relatively distant sources , and generally too faint for exoplanet surveys .",

    "stars are identified as probable m dwarfs based on various color and reduced proper motions cuts ; all selected candidates have , e.g. , optical - to - infrared colors @xmath22 .",
    "the low proper motion limit of the superblink catalog excludes nearly all background red giants .",
    "the low proper motion limit however also results in a kinematic bias , whose effects are discussed in  2.3 below .",
    "while some astrometric and photometric data have already been compiled for all the stars , most lack formal spectral classification .",
    "spectral subtypes have been estimated in @xcite only based on a calibrated relationship between m subtype and @xmath23 color . however , the @xmath24 magnitudes of many superblink catalog stars are based on photographic measurements ( from poss - ii plates ) ; the resulting @xmath23 colors have relatively low accuracy and are sometimes unreliable . besides from affecting spectral type estimates , unreliable colors can cause contamination of our sample of m dwarf candidates by bluer g and k dwarfs , which would have otherwise failed the color cut .",
    "these are strong arguments for performing systematic spectroscopic follow - up observations , to provide reliable spectral typing and filter out g / k dwarfs ( or any remaining m giant contaminants ) .",
    "a subsample of the brightest of the m dwarfs candidates , with apparent infrared magnitude j@xmath25 was assembled for the first phase of this survey .",

    "spectral indices were measured and the spectra were classified using the classification method outlined below (  3.1 ) .",
    "the spectra were then compared to classification templates assembled from m dwarf spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectroscopic database .",
    "each spectrum was divided by the classification template of the same alleged spectral subtype . in many cases ,",
    "the quotients yielded a flat function , indicating that the spectrophotometric calibration was acceptable .",
    "other quotients yielded residuals consistent with first or second order polynomials spanning the entire wavelength range , and indicating problems in the spectrophotometric calibration .",
    "a second - order polynomial was fit through the quotient spectra , and the original spectrum was normalized by this fit , correcting for calibration errors .",
    "spectral indices were then measured again , and the spectra reclassified ; this yielded changes by 0.5 to 1.0 subtypes for @xmath36 of the stars ( no changes for the rest ) .",
    "the re - normalization was then performed again using the revised spectral subtypes , and the procedure repeated until convergence for all stars .",
    "finally , all the spectra were wavelength - shifted to the rest frames of their emitting stars .",
    "this was done by cross - correlating each spectrum with the sdss template of the corresponding spectral subtype .",
    "spectral indices were again re - measured , and the stars re - classified .",
    "any change in the spectral subtype prompted a repeat of the flux - recalibration procedure outlined above , and the cross - correlation procedure was repeated using the revised spectral template until converegence .",

    "after standard ccd preprocessing ( dark , bias , and flat - field corrections ) , data were assembled into red and blue 3d data cubes .",
    "the data cubes were cleaned for cosmic rays and bad pixels , wavelength - calibrated using arc lamp exposures acquired immediately after the science exposures , and spectrospatially flat - fielded , using continuum lamp exposures obtained during the same night .",
    "the data cubes were then sky - subtracted , and the 1d spectra were extracted using a semi - analytic psf model .",

    "as with the mdm data , snifs spectra were shifted to the rest frames of their emitting stars by cross - correlation to sdss templates @xcite of the corresponding spectral subtype .",
    "spectral indices were re - measured and the stars re - classified .",

    "signal - to - noise ratio is generally s / n@xmath12100 near 7500 .",
    "we first examined all the spectra by eye to confirm the presence of morphological features consistent with red dwarfs of spectral subtype k5 and later .",
    "the main diagnostic was the detection of broad cah and tio moleculars band near 7000 .",
    "of the 1564 stars observed , 1408 were found to have clear evidence of cah and tio .",
    "the remaining 156 stars did not show those molecular features clearly , within the noise limit , and were therefore identified as probable contaminants in the target selection algorithm .",
    "most of these contaminants appeared to be early to mid - type k dwarfs , with a few looking like g dwarfs affected by interstellar reddening .",
    "a number of stars also displayed carbon features consistent with low gravity objects , most probably k giants .",
    "we suspect that many of the g and k dwarfs have inaccurate v - band magnitudes , making them appear redder than they really are , which would explain their inclusion in our color - selected sample .",
    "interstellar reddening would also explain the inclusion of more distant g dwarfs in our sample , due to their redder colors . an alternate explanation , however , might be that the targets were mis - acquired in the course of the survey , and that the spectra represent random field stars .",
    "indeed the very large proper motion of the sources sometimes makes them difficult to identify at the telescope , as they often have moved significantly from their positions on finder charts .",
    "stars in crowded field are particularly susceptible to this effect . to verify this hypothesis",
    ", we compared the @xmath23 color distribution of the contaminants to the distribution of the full survey sample ( figure  [ contaminant ] , top panel ) ; the fraction of contaminant stars in each color bin is also shown ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the two distributions are significantly different , with the contaminants being dominated by relatively blue stars , and their fraction quickly drops as @xmath23 increases .",
    "we can only conclude that the contaminants are not mis - acquired stars , otherwise one would expect the two distributions to be statistically equivalent . rather , the majority of the contaminants must have been properly acquired and are simply moderately red fgk stars that slipped into the sample in the photometric / proper motion selection , as suggested first .",
    "we find an overall contamination rate of @xmath3410% in our survey , although most of the contamination occurs among stars with relatively blue colors .",
    "the contamination rate is @xmath3426% for red dwarf candidates in the @xmath37 color range , but this rate drops to @xmath348% for candidates with @xmath38 , and becomes negligible ( @xmath39 ) in the redder @xmath40 candidates .",
    "the 156 stars identified as contaminants are included in table  [ table_photo ] and table  [ table_spectro ] for completeness and future verification .",
    "spectroscopic measurements for these stars , such as band indices , subtypes , and effective temperatures , are however left blank .",
    "the spectra of m dwarfs are dominated by molecular bands from metal oxides ( mainly tio , vo ) , metal hydrides ( cah , crh , feh ) , and metal hydroxides ( caoh ) .",
    "the most prominent of these in the optical - red wavelength range ( 5000-9,000 ) are the bands from titanium oxide ( tio ) and calcium hydride ( cah ) .",
    "the resulting opacities from those broad moleciular bands significantly affect the broadband colors and spectral energy distribution of m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "early atmospheric models of m dwarfs showed that the strength of the tio and cah bands depends on effective temperature , but also on surface gravity and metal abundances @xcite .",
    "molecular bands have historically been the defining diagnostic and classification features of m dwarfs . for stars that have settled on the main sequence",
    ", one can assume that the surface gravity is entirely constrained by the mass and chemical composition .",
    "leaving only the effective temperature and chemical abundances as general parameters in the classification and/or spectroscopic modeling . for local disk stars of solar metallicity , a classification system representing an effective temperature sequence",
    "can thus be established based on molecular bandstrentghs .",
    "the detection and measurement of tio and cah molecular bands thus forms the basis for the m dwarf classification system @xcite .",
    "molecular bands become detectable starting at spectral subtype k5 and k7 , the latest subtypes for k dwarfs ( there are no k6 , k8 , or k9 subtypes ) .",
    "the increasing strength of the molecular bands then defines a sequence running from m0 to m9 .",
    "the strength of both tio and cah molecular bands reach a maximum around @xmath412700k .",
    "there is a turnaround in the correlation below this point , and molecular bands become progressively weaker at lower temperatures until they vanish @xcite . the reversal and weakening is thought to be due to the condensation of molecules into dust , and their settling below the photosphere @xcite .",

    "to better quantify the classification system , a number of `` band indices '' were defined by @xcite , which measure the ratio between on - band and off - band flux , for various molecular bandheads .",
    "calibration of these band indices against classification standards provide a means to objectively assign subtypes based on spectroscopic measurements . originally , these band indices measured the strengths of various features near @xmath42 , where the most prominent cah and tio features are found in early - type m dwarfs .",
    "these bands , however , become saturated in late - type m dwarfs , which makes their use problematic in later dwarfs .",
    "there is a vo band near @xmath43 , located just between the main cah and tio features , which becomes prominent only at later subtypes ; and band index measuring this feature was introduced as a primary diagnosis for the so - called `` ultra - cool '' m dwarfs , and provided a classification scale for subtypes m7-m9 @xcite .",
    "additional band indices associated with tio and vo bands in the 7500-9000  range , where molecular absorption develops at later subtypes , were introduced as secondary classification features @xcite .",
    "these form the basis of current classification methods based on optical - red spectroscopy .",
    "nearby low - mass stars associated with the local halo population have long been known to show peculiar banstrength ratios , and in particular to have weak tio compared to cah @xcite .",
    "a system to identify and classify the metal - poor m subdwarfs based on the strength and ratio of cah and tio was introduced by @xcite , and expanded by @xcite and @xcite , as the spectroscopic census of m subdwarfs grew larger . in this system ,",
    "the cah bandstrengths are used as a proxy of @xmath44 and determine spectral subtypes , while the tio / cah band ratio is used to evaluate metallicity .",
    "for that purpose , the @xmath45 parameter , which is a function of the tio / cah band ratio , was introduced by @xcite as a possible proxy for metallicity , and a tentative calibration with [ fe / h ] was presented by @xcite .",
    "one of the main issues in the current m dwarf classification scheme , is that both tio and cah bandstrengths are used to determine the spectral subtype , whereas tio is now believed to be quite sensitive to metallicity .",
    "this means , e.g. , that moderately metal - rich m dwarfs may be assigned later subtypes than solar - metallicity ones . in addition , the classification of young field m dwarfs may be affected by their lower surface gravities , which also tend to increase tio bandstrengths and would thus yield to marginally later subtype assignments compared with older stars of the same @xmath7 .",
    "these caveats must be considered when one uses m dwarf spectral subtypes as a proxy for surface temperature .",
    "the strength of the tio , cah , and vo molecular bands are measured using spectral band indices .",
    "these spectral indices measure the ratio between the flux in a section of the spectrum affected by molecular opacity to the flux in a neighboring section of the spectrum minimally affected by molecular opacity .",
    "the latter section defines a pseudo - continuum of sorts , although m dwarf spectra do not have a continuum in the classical sense , because their spectral energy distribution strongly deviates from that of a blackbody , and is essentially shaped by atomic and molecular line opacities .",
    "we settle on a set of six spectral band indices : cah2 , cah3 , tio5 , tio6 , tio7 , vo1 , and vo2 .",
    "these band indixes , which we previously used in @xcite to classify spectra collected at mdm , measure the strength of the most prominent bands of cah , tio , and vo in the @xmath46 regime .",
    "the spectral indices and are listed in table  [ tab : si ] along with their definition .",
    "the cah2 , cah3 , and tio5 indices are the same as those used in the palomar - msu survey , and were first defined in @xcite .",
    "the tio6 , vo1 , and vo2 indices were introduced by @xcite to better classify late - type m dwarfs , whose cah2 and tio5 indices become saturated at cooler tempratuers and are not as effective for accurate spectral classification of late - type m dwarfs .",
    "each spectral band index is calculated as the ratio of the flux in the spectral region of interest ( numerator ) to the flux in the reference region ( denominator ) , i.e. : @xmath47 because the wavelength range for some indices is relatively narrow ( especially the denominator for cah2 , cah3 , and tio5 ) it is important that the spectra in which they are measured have their wavelengths calibrated in the rest frame of the star , which is why special care was made to correct all spectra for any significant redshift / blueshift ( see above ) . because the measured molecular bandheads are relatively sharp , and because the spectral indices measuring them are defined over relatively narrow spectral ranges , the index values are potentially dependent on the spectroscopic resolution , and may thus depend on the specific instrumental setup used for the observations .",
    "in addition , the index values may be affected by systematic errors in the spectrophotometric flux calibration , which can also be dependent on the instrument and/or observatory where the measurements were made .",
    "one way to verify these effects is to compare spectral index measurements of the same stars obtained at different observatories . because of the significant overlap with the palomar - msu survey",
    ", we can use those stars as reference sample , and recalibrate the spectral indices so that they are consistent to those reported in @xcite .",
    "our census have 557 stars in common with the pmsu spectroscopic survey ; these stars are all identified with a flag ( `` p '' ) in the last column of table  [ table_spectro ] .",
    "we identify 206 stars from the list observed at mdm and 281 stars from the list observed at uh which have spectral index measurements reported in the pmsu survey .",
    "the differences between our measured cah2 , cah3 , and tio5 and those reported in the psmu catalog are plotted in figure  [ pmscomp ] .",
    "trends and offsets confirm the existence of systematic errors , possibly due to differences in resolution and flux calibration . to verify the spectroscopic resolution hypothesis ,",
    "we convolved the mdm spectra with a box kernel 5-pixel wide ; we found that indeed the mdm indices for the smoothed spectra had their offsets reduced by 0.01 - 0.02 units , bringing them more in line with the pmsu indices .",
    "we also observe that the mdm measurements tend to have a larger scatter than the uh ones ; we suggest that this may be due to spectrophometric calibration issues with some of the mdm spectra , as discussed in  2.3.1 .",
    "to achieve consistency in the measurements obtained at different observatories , we adopt the values from the pmsu survey as a standard of reference , and calculate corrections to the measurements from mdm and uh by fitting linear relationships to the residuals .",
    "a corrections to a spectral band index is thus applied following the general function : @xmath48 where @xmath49 represents the measured value of an index at the observatory @xmath50 , and ( @xmath51,@xmath52 ) are the coefficients of the transformation from the observed value to the corrected one ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "hence the corrected values of the indices cah2 , cah3 and tio5 for measurements done at mdm are defined as : @xmath54 the measurements from the psmu survey are used as standards for these three indices , and we thus have by definition : @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "for obs = mdm and obs = uh , the adopted correction coefficients are listed in table  [ tab : sic ] .",
    "the corresponding linear relationships are shown as red segments in figure  [ pmscomp ] .    to verify the consistency of the corrected spectral band index values ,",
    "we compare the corrected values for the stars observed at both mdm and uh ( the inter - observatory subset ) .",
    "the differences are shown in figure  [ idx_comp ] .",
    "we find the corrected values cah2@xmath57 , cah3@xmath57 , and tio5@xmath57 to be in good agreement , with no significant offsets beyond what is expected from measurement errors .",
    "the corrected values of all three spectral indices are listed in table  [ table_spectro ] .",
    "the tio6 , vo1 , and vo2 spectral index mesurements from mdm and uh are also compared in figure  [ idx_comp ] .",
    "those were not measured in the pmsu survey , since the indices were introduced later @xcite , and thus are displayed here without any correction .",
    "small but significant offsets between the mdm and uh values again suggest systematic errors due to differences in spectral resolution and flux calibration .",
    "this time we adopt the uh measurements as fiducials , and determine corrections to be applied to the mdm data .",
    "the corrections are listed in table  [ tab : sic ] and the corresponding linear relationships are displayed in figure  [ idx_comp ] as red segments .",
    "the corrected values of the three spectral indices are also listed in table  [ table_spectro ] .",
    "the scatter between the mdm and uh values , after correction , as well as the scatter between the uh / mdm and pmsu values , provide an estimate of the measurment accuracy for these spectral indices . excluding a few outliers , the mean scatter is @xmath120.02 units ( 1@xmath58 ) for the cah2 , cah3 , tio5 , tio6 , and vo1 indices , and @xmath120.04 units for vo2 .",
    "this assumes that m stars do not show any significant changes in their spectral morphology over time , and that the spectral indices should thus not be variable .",
    "because of the correlation between spectral subtype and the depth of the molecular bands , it is possible to use the values of the spectral band indices to estimate spectral subtypes .",
    "this only requires a calibration of the relationship between spectral index values and the spectral subtypes , in a set of stars which were classified by other means , e.g. , classification standards .",
    "the system adopted in this paper uses the spectral indices listed in table  [ tab : si ] , and follows the methodology outlined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "relationships are calibrated for each spectral index , and spectral subtypes are calculated from the mean values obtained from all relevant / available spectral indices .",
    "the mean values are then be rounded to the nearest half integer , to provide formal subtyping with half - integer resolution .",
    "the system is extended to late - k dwarfs as well : an `` m subtype '' with a value @xmath59 signifies that star is a late - k dwarf : the star is classified as k7 for an index value @xmath60 and as k5 for an index value @xmath61 ( note : there is no k6 subtype for dwarf stars , and k7 is the subtype immediately preceding m0 ) .",
    "the original spectral - index classification method for m dwarfs / subdwarfs is based on a relationship between subtype and with the cah2 index , which measures one of the most prominent band at all spectral subtypes , and notably displays the deepest bandhead in metal - poor m subdwarfs @xcite .",

    "we found small but significant differences in our estimated spectral subtypes and the values formally assigned by @xcite ; subtypes estimated from the @xcite relationship tend to systematically underestimate the standard subtypes by @xmath63 units for stars later than m3 . to improve on the index classification method , we performed a @xmath64 polynomial fit to recalibrate the relationship , obtaining : @xmath65_{\\rm cah2 } = 11.50 - 21.71 \\",

    "the relationships are slightly different from those quoted in @xcite and @xcite but are internally consistent to each other , whereas an application of the older relationships to our corrected band index measurements would yield internal inconsistencies , with subtype difference up to 1 spectral subtype between the relationships .    the ratio of oxides ( tio , vo ) to hydrides ( cah , crh , feh ) in m dwarfs is known to vary significantly with metallicity @xcite . in the metal - poor m subdwarfs , it is the oxides bands that appear to be weaker , while hydride bands remain relatively strong ( in the most metal - poor ultrasubdwarfs , or usdm , the tio bands are almost undetectable )",
    ". therefore it makes sense to rely more on the cah band as the primary subtype / temperature calibrator .",
    "the same @xmath66_{\\rm cah2}$ ] and @xmath66_{\\rm    cah3}$ ] relationships should be used to determine spectral subtypes at all metallicity classes ( i.e. in m subdwarfs as well as in m dwarfs ) .",
    "because the tio and vo bands are also strong in the metal - rich m dwarfs , it is still useful to include these bands as secondary indicators , to refine the spectral classification . in the late - type m dwarfs , in fact ,",
    "the cah bandheads are saturating , and one has to rely on the tio and vo bands .",
    "in fact , the vo bands were originally used to diagnose and calibrate ultracool m dwarfs of subtypes m7-m9 @xcite .",
    "the main caveat in using the oxide bands for spectral classification is that this can potentially introduce a metallicity dependence on the estimated spectral subtype , with more metal - rich stars being assigned later subtypes than what they would have based on the strength of their cah bands alone . in any case , because our sample appears to be dominated by near - solar metallicity stars , we calibrate additional relationships between subtype and the tio5 and tio6 bands indices .",
    "we first recalculate the subtypes by averaging the values of @xmath67_{cah2}$ ] and @xmath62_{cah2}$ ] , and perform a @xmath64 fit of the tio5 and tio6 indices to the mean subtypews calculated from cah2 and cah3 , finding : @xmath65_{\\rm tio5 } = 7.83 - 9.55 \\ { \\rm tio5}_{c}\\ ] ] @xmath65_{\\rm tio6 } = 9.92 - 15.68 \\ { \\rm tio6}_{c } + 21.23 \\ \\left ( { \\rm tio6}_{c } \\right)^2\\ ] ] @xmath68 where again the corrected band indices are used . the relatively sharp non - linear deviation in the tio6 distribution around m3 forces the use of a third order polynomial in the fit .",

    "the vo2 index also shows unexpectedly large scatter in the mdm spectra , including in the classification standard stars , which we suspect is due the fact that the index is defined very close to the red edge of the mdm spectral range and is thus more subject to statistical noise and flux calibration errors .",

    "while this would make it possible to classify the stars to within a tenth of a subtype , we prefer to follow the general convention and assign spectral subtypes to the nearest half integer .    to verify the consistency of the spectral classification , we compare the spectral types evaluated independently for the list of 141 stars observed at both mdm and uh . we find that 82% of the stars end up with the same spectral type assigments from both observatories , i.e. they have spectra assigned to the same half - subtype .",

    "most of the stars in our survey have subtypes in the m0.0-m3.0 range .",
    "the sharp drop for stars of subtypes k7.5 and k7.0 is explained by the color selection used in the @xcite catalog ( @xmath22 ) which was originally intended to select only m dwarfs ; note that stars with subtypes earlier than k7.0 are also excluded from the graph , and are probably contaminants of the color selection in any case .",

    "this subset includes all of the 156 stars that were visually identified as non - m dwarfs on first inspection ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "the remaining 14 stars were initially found to be consistent with late - k stars , and classified as k7.0 and k7.5 objects using the spectral index method described in  3.2 above ; we investigated further to determine why the stars were classified as early k using the hammer . on closer inspection",
    ", we found that 3 of the stars are indeed more consistent with mid - k dwarfs that k7.0 or k7.5 , and we thus overran the spectral index classification and reclassified them as  g / k  in table  [ table_spectro ] .",

    "the one exception is the star pm i11055 + 4331 ( gl 412b ) which the band index measurements classify as m6.5 ; in this case the hammer determined subtype of m 5.0 appears to be more accurate .",
    "this exception likely occurs because of the saturation of the cah2 and cah3 subtypes in the late - type star , which make the band - index classification less reliable .",
    "after the pmsu survey , the largest spectroscopic survey of m dwarfs in the northern sky was the one presented in the `` meet the cool neighbors '' ( mcn ) paper series @xcite . in this section",
    "we compared the spectral clssification from the mcn survey with our own spectral type assignments .",
    "to identify the stars in common between the two surveys , we first performed a cross - correlation of the celestial coordinates of the stars listed in the mcn tables , to the coordinates listed in the superblink catalog .",

    "close examination of digitized sky survey scans failed to identify the stars at the locations quoted in mcn .",
    "a closer examination of the fields around those stars identified 49 cases where a high proper motion stars could be found within 3of the quoted mcn positions .",
    "these nearby high proper motion stars are all listed in superblink , and have colors consistent with m dwarfs ; we therefore assumed that the quoted mcn positions are in error , and matched those 49 mcn entries with the close by high proper motions stars from superblink .",
    "of the remaining 22 stars we found 6 that have proper motions below the superblink limit of @xmath21 mas yr@xmath2 and another 5 stars with proper motions within the superblink limit but that appear to have been missed by the superblink survey . finally , there were 11 mcn stars that we could not identify at all on the digitized sky survey images , and we can only assume that the positions quoted in mcn are too large for proper identification , and that the stars should be considered `` lost '' .",
    "of the 909 stars in the mcn program with superblink counterparts , we found only 219 which satisfy the magnitude limit ( @xmath0 ) of our present sample of very bright m dwarfs .",

    "the other 4 stars are classified as m dwarfs , although they have @xmath84 according to @xcite .",
    "we infer that our @xmath23 colors for those stars are probably underestimated , which suggests that our color selection may be overlooking a small fraction of nearby m dwarfs .",

    "all 6 stars are very bright in the infrared , and it appears that at least one of the @xmath31 or @xmath87 magnitudes listed in the 2mass catalog may be in error , making the stars appear to have @xmath85 and/or @xmath86 colors more consistent with giants .",
    "four of the stars are classified as m dwarfs in mcn , the other two are late - k dwarfs .",
    "overall , this makes a total of 8 m dwarfs from the mcn census that were overlooked in our selection out of the mcn subset of @xmath12150 nearby m dwarfs .",
    "this suggests that our color cuts , combined with magnitude measurement errors , might be missing @xmath88 of the very bright , nearby m dwarfs .    in the end , this leaves only 161 stars in common between the mcn program and our own spectroscopic survey .",
    "the stars are all classified as late - k and m dwarfs by mcn , with subtypes ranging from k5 to m5.5 .",

    "we compare the recorded values of the cah2 , cah3 , and tio5 indices between the mcn program and our own survey . after a search of the various tables published in the mcn series of papers",

    "the completeness depends on the local distribution of stellar motions , and increases with distance from the sun . to estimate the kinematics bias in our sample",
    ", we built a model reproducing the local distribution and kinematics of nearby m dwarfs .",
    "we first assumed the stars to have a uniform spatial distribution in the solar vicinity , and generated a random distribution of @xmath104 objects within a sphere of radius @xmath105pc centered on the sun .",
    "we assigned transverse motions to all the stars , assuming a velocity - space distribution similar to that of the nearby ( d@xmath20100pc ) g dwarfs in the hipparcos catalog @xcite .",
    "because the distribution of stellar velocities is not isotropic , we assigned transverse motions for each simulated star based on the statistical distribution of transverse motions for hipparcos stars with sky coordinates within @xmath106 of the simulated object .",
    "we also used the simplifying assumption that the local m dwarf population has a uniform distribution of absolute magnitudes over the range @xmath107 , which is the approximate range of absolute magnitudes reported in the literature for m dwarfs .",
    "we then counted the total number of stars in the simulation with apparent magnitudes @xmath0 , and calculated the fraction of those stars with proper motions @xmath21 mas yr@xmath2 .",
    "we found that 93% of nearby m dwarfs with @xmath0 , on average , have proper motions above the superblink limit .",
    "m dwarfs with @xmath0 extend to a maximum distance of 63 parsecs ; most of the stars which fail the proper motion cut are in the higher distance range ( d@xmath2050pc ) , and are stars near the bright end of the luminosity distribution @xmath108 . for this reason ,",
    "if we assume a luminosity function which increases at fainter absolute magnitudes , the fraction of @xmath0 stars which fall within the proper motion cut is increased , because more of the @xmath0 stars in the local population are now m dwarfs of lower luminosities and closer distances , which are more likely to have high proper motions .",
    "the observed field m dwarf luminosity function does indeed increase for early - type dwarfs , to reach a peak at @xmath109 @xcite , which means that the 93% completeness estimated above must be a lower limit . to verify this",
    ", we tested a luminosity function where the number of stars increases linearly with absolute magnitude and doubles from @xmath110 to @xmath111 ; with this model , our simulations showed that 96% of all @xmath0 m dwarfs , would have @xmath21 mas yr@xmath2 , and thus be within the detection limit of superblink .",
    "overall , this suggests that only about @xmath112 of all @xmath0 m dwarfs on the sky will be overlooked in our census because of the proper motion bias .",
    "the superblink surveys does however suffer from various other sources of incompleteness , such as the inability to detect moving stars in saturated regions of photographic plates ( i.e. in the immediate vicinity of very bright stars ) , or a difficulty in detecting stars in very crowded field .",
    "also , the superblink code has trouble detecting the motions of relatively bright @xmath10 stars because of the saturated cores of their point spread functions . in practice",
    ", this is mitigated by incorporating data from the tycho-2 catalog , which provides very accurate proper motion measurements for bright stars .",
    "however the tycho-2 catalog itself has some level of incompleteness in the @xmath113 manitude range .",
    "one way to test incompleteness due to crowding or saturation is to examine the distribution of superblink stars as a function of galactic latitude . crowding and",
    "saturation effects should be more pronounced in low galactic - latitude fields , where the stellar density is high . in comparison",
    ", stars in high galactic latitude fields will be easier to detect with the superblink code .",
    "the same is true for the tycho-2 catalog , which should be more complete at high galactic latitudes .",
    "we calculated the number of spectroscopically confirmed m dwarfs in our sample as a function of @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the galactic latitude .",
    "the distribution is shown in figure  [ compl ] ; the number of stars in each bin is plotted as a filled circle , with errobars showing the @xmath80 poisson error .",
    "the distribution increases with @xmath114 because our stars are all located north of the celestial equator . for comparison , we plot the trend expected of a uniform distribution of stars in the local volume ( blue histogram ) , assuming the same total number of stars as in our census .",
    "we find our data to be largely consistent with the uniform distribution model , and see no evidence of a significant dip at low galactic latitude , which one would expect if the superblink survey is incomplete at low @xmath115 .",
    "this suggests that our sample does not suffer from significant sources of incompleteness due to saturation / crowding .",
    "one might however argue that the uniform density assumption is invalid for a census extending to @xmath3470pc of the sun , and that a slight overdensity of stars should be detected at low galactic latitudes .",
    "the fact that we see no evidence of such an overdensity in our data would then be indirect evidence of incompleteness at low galactic latitude . to examine this possibility , we estimated the expected distributions from simulations in which the stellar density perpendicular to the plane ( i.e. along @xmath116 ) decreases with scale heights of 400pc or 200pc . kinematics and absolute magnitude distributions were also simulated as described above , and stars were selected based on @xmath0 and @xmath21 mas yr@xmath2 .",
    "the mean distributions from the 400pc and 200pc scale - height models are shown in figure  [ compl ] , and do indeed predict a slight overdensity of objects at low galactic latitudes .",
    "assuming that all the stars at high galactic latitude are detected in all the models , we find a @xmath115% excess of stars in the 400pc scale - height model over the observed number , and a @xmath1110% excess of stars in the 200pc scale - height model .",
    "one might then argue that the supeblink census potentially has an additional 5%-10% incompleteness level , due to incompleteness in the plane of the milky way .",
    "this is most probably an overestimate , however , because there is no evidence that the local stellar distribution shows any significant decrease with @xmath116 .",
    "overall , the superblink census appears to be essentially complete at low galactic latitudes .",
    "proper - motion selection may introduce an additional bias against metal - rich and/or young stars , which tend to have lower components of motion in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "however this effect is expected to be small , e.g. a few percent against [ fe / h ] = 0 relative to [ fe / h ] = -0.5 at 45  pc @xcite .",
    "nearly all likely members of the hyades @xcite , ursa majoris @xcite , and tw hydrae @xcite young nearby moving groups have proper motions that exceed 40  mas yr@xmath2 and thus would not be selected against using the current selection method .",
    "finally , some bright m dwarfs may be overlooked because of the imposed color cuts , due to magnitude errors and uncertainties .",
    "as described in  3.4 above , a handful of previously known m dwarfs from the mcn census were overlooked in our target selection for precisely those reasons . as suggested in  3.4 ,",
    "it is possible that we may be overlooking 5% of bright m dwarfs because of magnitude errors .",
    "this , combined with the estimated 96% completeness in the proper motion selection estimated above , suggests that our list of 1405 m dwarfs likely includes @xmath117 of all existing m dwarfs with infrared magnitude @xmath0 as seen from earth .",
    "there may still be @xmath12140 bright m dwarfs to be identified , although the precise number can only be determined after these `` missing '' stars are found .",
    "we compared our spectra to a grid of 298 models of k- and m - dwarf spectra generated by the bt - settl version of phoenix @xcite .",
    "bt - settl includes updated opacities ( i.e. of h@xmath118o ) , revised solar abundances @xcite , a refractory cloud model , and rotational hydrodynamic mixing .",
    "the models include effective temperatures @xmath7 of 3000 - 5000  k in steps of 100  k , @xmath119 values of 4 , 4.5 , and 5 , and metallicities of [ m / h ] = -1.5 , -1 , -0.5 , 0 , + 0.3 , and + 0.5 .",
    "for each temperature , @xmath119 and metallicity value , we selected the model with @xmath8/fe that was closest to solar .",
    "the spectral density of model calculations varies with wavelength but is everywhere vastly greater than the resolution of our spectra .",
    "model spectra were thus convolved with a gaussian with fhwm of the same resolution as the spectra , and a corrective shift ( typically less than a resolution element ) was found by cross - correlating the observed and model spectra .",
    "normalized spectra were ratioed and @xmath64 calculated using the variance spectrum of the observations .",
    "we restricted the spectral range over which @xmath64 is calculated to 5600 - 9000  and excluded the problematic region 6400 - 6600  which contains poorly - modeled tio absorption @xcite .",
    "we also excluded regions where the telluric correction is rapidly changing with wavelength , i.e. the slope , smoothed over 4 resolution elements or 11.7 , exceeds 1.37 @xmath2 .",
    "the model with the smallest @xmath64 value was identified . for a more refined estimate of effective temperature ,",
    "we selected the 7 best - fit models and constructed 10,000 linear combinations of them ; the `` effective temperature '' of each is the weighted sum of the temperatures of the components .",

    "we calculated the standard deviation of @xmath7 among the combination models as a function of the maximum allowed @xmath64 .",
    "we reported the maximum standard deviation as a conservative estimate of uncertainty .",
    "we also calculated formal 95% confidence intervals for @xmath7 based solely on the expected distribution of @xmath64 for @xmath120 degrees of freedom , where @xmath121 is the number of resolution elements used in the fit .",

    "our model - fit algorithm prefers values that match the @xmath7 model grid , which have a 100k grid step ( i.e. , 3500k is preferred over 3510k ) .",
    "our results suggest the existence of a @xmath7 plateau spanning m1-m3 . to investigate this further",
    ", we compare our values to the effective temperatures reported in @xcite for 18 of the stars in our sample , and in @xcite for another 49 stars ; our own spectral type determinations are combined to the t@xmath122 measured by the other authors .",
    "the values are compared in figure  [ spt_color ] .",
    "we find that our mid - type plateau is corroborated with the @xcite values , but not with those from @xcite , whose values decrease more linearly with spectral subtype .",

    "it is interesting that the fits to the optical and infrared spectra yield t@xmath122 values which are in agreement .",
    "the disagreement with the photometric determinations however suggest that atmospheric models for m dwarfs are still not well understood , in particular in the m1-m4 spectral regimes .",
    "the @xmath45 parameter ( denoted @xmath4 for short ) is a combination of the tio5 , cah2 , and cah3 spectral indices which was shown to be correlated with metallicity in metal - poor m subdwarfs @xcite .",
    "the index was first described in @xcite , and a revised calibration has recently been proposed by @xcite .",

    "this is because the strengths of both the tio and cah bands are generally greater , and their ratio can thus be measured with higher accuracy . the index is much leass reliable at earlier m subtypes however , and is notably inefficient for late - k stars .",

    "all the stars in the two distributions from the present survey have @xmath4 values between @xmath110.9 and @xmath111.2 , and thus represent the metal - rich end of the distribution .",
    "the weaker slopes we find in our correlations ( 0.75 and 1.07 ) may indicate that the relationship levels off at high metallicity end , which would make @xmath4 much less useful as a metallicity diagnostic tool in solar - metallicity and metal - rich m dwarfs .",

    "m subdwarfs are stars with @xmath1550.82 @xcite .",
    "though we have a few stars with values of @xmath4 just marginally under 0.82 , only one star clearly stands out as a definite m subdwarf : the star pm i20050 + 5426 (= gl 781 ) which boasts a @xmath156 well within the m subdwarf regime .",
    "the star also clearly stands out in figure  [ cah_tio ] where it lies noticeably below the main locus at tio5@xmath1570.75 .",

    "our own spectrum indeed shows a relatively strong line of h@xmath8 in emission , which is extremely unusual for an m subdwarf .",
    "it is an interesting coincidence that the brightest m subdwarf in the northern sky should turn out to be a peculiar object .    in any case , because the tio molecular bands are weaker in m subdwarfs than they are in m dwarfs , the use of tio spectral indices for spectral classification leads to underestimates of their spectral subtype .",
    "the convention for m subdwarfs is rather to base the classification on the strengths of the cah bandheads @xcite .",
    "we adopt the same convention here , and recalculate the subtype from the mean of equations 6 and 7 only ( cah2 and cah3 indices ) .",
    "we thus classify pm i20050 + 5426 as an sdm2.0 , which is one half - subtype later than the sdm1.5 classification suggested by @xcite .",
    "a prediction of current atmospheric models is that metallicity variations in m dwarfs yield significant variations in optical broadband colors @xcite .",
    "the metal - poor m subdwarfs have in fact long been known to have bluer v - i colors than the more metal - rich field m dwarfs of the same luminosity @xcite .",
    "the bluer colors are due to reduced tio opacities in the optical , which make the spectral energy distribution of m subdwarfs closer to that of a blackbody , while it makes the metal - rich m dwarfs display extreme red colors .",
    "interestingly , the sdss @xmath158 color index shows the opposite trend , and is bluer in the more metal - poor stars .",
    "this is because the tio bands very strongly depress the flux in the 6000-7000  ( r - band ) range , an effect which in fact makes the metal - rich m dwarfs degenerate in @xmath158 , as the increased tio opacities in cooler stars balance out the reduced flux in @xmath159 from lower t@xmath122 .",
    "this effect is much weaker in metal - poor stars due to the reduced tio opacity , which makes metal - poor stars go redder as they are cooler , as one would normally expect .",
    "this has been observed in late - type m subdwarfs , which have significantly redder color that field m dwarfs @xcite .",

    "the models corroborate observations and predict redder @xmath158 colors in metal - poor stars .    although @xmath161 photometry is not available for our stars ( all of them are too bright and saturated in the sloan digital sky survey ) , it is possible to use the well - calibrated snifs spectrophotometry to calculate synthetic broadband @xmath162 magnitudes for the subset of stars observed at uh .",
    "we first examine any possible correlation between the optical to infrared @xmath163 color ( taken as a proxy for v - i ) and the @xmath4 index .",

    "however , there are some stars identified as active based on uv flux that are not identified as such from their x - ray and/or @xmath169 emission .",
    "again this suggests that a complete identification of active m dwarfs in the solar vicinity may require a combination of diagnostic features .    in any case our survey , which combines x - ray , uv , and @xmath169 diagnostics , provides a valuable subset for identifying low - mass young stars in the solar neighborhood , and may potentially yield new members of young moving groups , or even the identification of new moving groups .",

    "the flag indicates activity by a `` y '' .",

    "the 1@xmath58 dispersion about these relationships are @xmath189 mag for ( m@xmath190,v - j ) , and @xmath191 mag for ( m@xmath190,spt ) .",
    "the smaller scatter in the spectroscopic relationship suggests that spectroscopic distances may be marginally more accurate than the photometric ones .",
    "we suspect that the larger uncertainty on the photographic @xmath24 magnitudes may be the cause .",
    "the most notable feature in the diagrams is that active stars appear to be systematically more luminous than non - active stars .",

    ", we find that among stars of spectral subtype m2 and earlier , active stars are on average 0.46mag more luminous at a given subtype than non - active stars ; in the color - magnitude diagram , bluer stars of colors @xmath193 which are active are on average 0.47mag more luminous than non - active stars of the same color .",
    "both values agree well with the values quoted by @xcite .",
    "the systematic overluminosity of active stars is also responsible for some of the scatter in the color - magnitude and spectral - type magnitude relationships .",
    "if we exclude active stars , the scatter about the color - magnitude relationship fals marginally to @xmath194 , and the scatter in the spectral - type magnitude relationship falls to @xmath195 .",
    "the offset in absolute magnitude between active and non - active stars suggests that spectroscopic and photometric distances would be more accurate for active stars in our census if their estimated absolute magnitudes were made 0.46mag brighter that suggested by equation  [ eqn : mj_vs_spt ] .",
    "we therefore adopt the following relationships to be applied only on active stars of subtype m2.5 and earlier : @xmath196}_{early - active } = 0.734 + 1.823 ( v - j ) - 0.079 ( v - j)^2\\\\ { [ m_j]}_{early - active } = 5.220 + 0.393 ( spt ) + 0.040 ( spt)^2   \\label{eqn : mj_vs_spt2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again we define as `` active '' any star which qualifies as such base on any one of our criteria ( h@xmath8 , uv , x - ray ) .",
    "there are several reasons that would explain why active , early - type stars are more luminous at a given subtype .",
    "activity in an early - type m dwarf could mean that the star is younger @xcite ; early - type m dwarfs with ages @xmath197myr are known to be overluminous at a given color , due to lower surface gravity @xcite .",
    "older stars could remain active due to interaction with a close companion @xcite , in which case the active stars would also appear overluminous due to this unresolved companion .",
    "late - type m dwarfs , however , can remain active for long periods of time , and would thus not require the star to be young or have a close companion .    splitting the active and inactive stars results in lowering the scatter of non - active stars in the subtype - magnitude relationship ( to @xmath330.5mag ) .",
    "overall , our spectroscopic distances for non - active m dwarfs provide a @xmath80 uncertainty of @xmath198 on the distance . for active stars ,",
    "we find a scatter of @xmath330.6mag , which suggests distance uncertainties of @xmath199 .",
    "our photometric distances estimated from ( v , v - j ) have similar though perhaps slightly larger uncertainties . photometric and spectroscopic parallaxes , estimated from the above relationships for active and non - active stars , are listed in table  [ table_distance ] .",
    "we estimated the effect of two relevant sampling biases on the calibration between @xmath185 and @xmath23 color .",
    "in eddington bias , photometric errors scatter more numerous , bluer , and intrinsically brighter stars to redder apparent colors than redder stars are scattered to bluer apparent colors @xcite .",
    "the net effect is to make stars at a given apparent color appear more luminous than they are . in lutz - kelker ( lk ) bias ,",
    "a form of malmquist bias , errors in trigonometric prallax will scatter more numerous and more distant stars with lower parallax to higher apparent parallax values , making them appear less luminous than they are @xcite . by taking the derivative of @xmath185 with respect @xmath23 color , multiplying by the derivative of the number of stars in our @xmath30-magnitude - limited catalog with respect to @xmath185 , assuming that the errors in @xmath23 are gaussian - distributed with standard deviation @xmath200 , and integrating over the distribution",

    "performing a similar derivation for the effect of l - k bias on @xmath185 , we find : @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the fractional error in parallax .",
    "using published parallax errors for our _ hipparcos _ stars and adopting a conservative @xmath205 , we find that l - k bias usually dominates over eddington bias and that 74% of our stars have a total bias of less than + 0.2 magnitudes .",

    "figure [ disthist ] shows the distribution of photometric distances for our complete sample using equation [ eqn : mj_vs_spt ] and the m@xmath190=m@xmath190(v - j ) color - magnitude relationship .",
    "the spectral subtypes are plotted in separate colors and demonstrates that the earlier - type stars , which are intrinsically brighter , are sampled to significantly larger distances compared with the later - type stars . in the 20pc volume",
    ", the m3-m4 stars still appear to dominate .",
    "we also plot the galactic height of the stars in our sample , adopting a galactic height of 15 pc for the sun @xcite .",
    "it is clear that our survey is largely contained within the galactic thin disk , and barely extends south of the midplane .",
    "this is consistent with the relative absence of metal - poor stars associated with the thick disk and halo .",
    "accurate radial velocities are not available for most of the stars in our sample , which prevents us from calculating the full ( u , v , w ) components of motion for each individual star . however , it is possible to use the distance measurements ( for stars with parallaxes ) or estimates ( for stars with no parallax ) , and combine them to the proper motions to evaluate with some accuracy at least two of these components for each star .",
    "more specifically , we calculate the ( u , v , w ) components by assuming that the radial velocities @xmath211 . we then consider the ( x , y , z ) positions of the stars in the galactic reference frame , from the distances and sky coordinates",
    ". for stars with the largest component of position in + x or -x , the radial velocity mostly contibute to u , and has minimal influence on the values of v and w. likewise stars with the largest component of position in + y or -y ( + z or -z ) make good tracers of the velocity distribution in u and w ( u and v ) .",
    "we use this to assign any one of ( u , v ) or ( u , w ) or ( v , w ) velocity component doublet to every m dwarf in our catalog .",
    "estimated values of the components of velocity are listed in table  [ table_distance ] . for each star ,",
    "one of the components is missing , which is the component that would most depend on the radial velocity component based on the coordinates of the star .",
    "again , the other two components are estimated only from proper motion and distance . for the distance",
    ", we use the trigonometric parallaxes whenever available ; otherwise the spectroscopic distances as are used , based on the raltionships described in the previous section .",
    "the resulting velocity distributions are displayed in figure  [ uvw ] .",
    "we measure mean values of the velocity components using all allowable values and find : @xmath212 @xmath213 @xmath214 the values are also largely consistent with those found from the pmsu survey and desribed in @xcite .",
    "they are also remarkably similar to the moments of the velocity components calculated by @xcite for sdss stars of the galactic thin disk , and which are @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and @xmath217 .",
    "the agreement suggests that our distance estimates are reasonably accurate , and it corroborates earlier results about the kinematics of the local m dwarf population which indicate a larger scatter of velocities in @xmath218 .",
    "the mean values of @xmath219 and @xmath220 are consistent with the offsets from the local standard of rest as described in @xcite    active stars are found to have significantly smaller dispersions in velocity space .",
    "all 252 stars with at least one activity flags ( i.e. stars found to be active either from h@xmath8 , x - ray flux , or uv excess ) are plotted in red in figure  [ uvw ] .",
    "those active stars have first and second moments : @xmath221 @xmath222 @xmath223 the values are consistent with @xcite , who also reported that active m dwarfs tend to have a smaller scatter compared with inactive m dwarfs .",
    "the smaller dispersion values suggest that these active stars may be significantly younger than the average star in the solar neighborhood .    in any case",
    ", we also note that the velocioty space distribution is non - uniform and shows evidence for substructure .",
    "our m dwarf data shows velocity - space substructure as that observed and described in @xcite for solar - type stars in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "this substructure is sometimes referred to as `` streams '' or `` moving groups '' , although an analysis by @xcite shows that these groups do not represent coeval populations arising from star - formation episodes .",
    "the velocity - space substructure is more likely transient and associated with gravitational perturbations which are the signature of the galactic spiral arms @xcite and the galactic bar @xcite .",
    "a simple description of the velocity - space distribution in terms of means values and dispersions , or as velocity ellipsoid , is therefore only a crude approximation of a more complex and structured distribution .",
    "finally , we note that the stars of our catalog that were previously part of the cns3 and stars with measured trigonometric parallaxes ( e.g. from the hipparcos catalog ) tend to have larger velocity dispersions , with @xmath224=(38.4,25.9,23.1 ) , while the newer stars have @xmath224=(26.2,19.4,15.3 )",
    ". the difference could be due to systematic underestimation of the photometric / spectroscopic distances , but a more likely explanation is that the cns3 and parallax subsample suffers from proper motion selection .",
    "this is because most of the cns3 stars and m dwarfs monitored with hipparcos were selected from historic catalogs of high proper motion stars , which have a higher limit than the superblink proper motion catalog used in the lg2011 selection .",
    "this kinematic bias means that the current subset of m dwarfs monitored for exoplanet programs suffers from the same kinematic bias , which could possibly introduce age and metallicity selection effects .",
    "we have now compiled spectroscopic data for a nearly complete list of m dwarfs in the northern sky with apparent magnitudes @xmath0 .",
    "our survey identifies a total of 1,403 very bright m dwarfs .",
    "our new catalog provides spectral subtypes and activity measurements ( @xmath169 emission ) for all stars , as well as a rough indicator of metallicity in the guise of the @xmath4 parameter , which measures the ratio of tio to cah bandstrengths .",
    "only one of the stars in the survey is unambiguously identified as a metal - poor m subdwarf ( pm i20050 + 5426 = v1513 cyg ) .",
    "our target stars were identified from the all - sky catalog of bright m dwarfs presented in @xcite . as such , our spectroscopic survey suffers from the same selection effects and completeness issues .",
    "the completeness and bias of the superblink proper motion survey , from which these stars were selected is discussed a length in @xcite . in the northern hemisphere ,",
    "the superblink catalog is complete for proper motions @xmath225  mas@xmath2 .",
    "we show in  4 that there is a kinematic bias in the catalog which excludes stars with very low transverse motions ( in the plane of the sky ) , but the low proper motion limit means that less than 5% of stars within 65 parsecs of the sun are in fact excluded in the selection .",
    "in addition , we estimate that @xmath125% of the nearby , bright m dwarfs may have escaped our target selection scheme due to faulty magnitudes .",
    "therefore , we estimate that our census most likely include @xmath3 of all existing m dwarfs in the northern sky with @xmath0 .",
    "early - type k7-m1 dwarfs have absolute magnitudes @xmath226 , and our @xmath0 sample thus identifies them well to a distance of about 50pc , as confirmed in figure  [ disthist ] . on the other hand ,",
    "later type m3-m4 dwarfs have @xmath227 and thus only those at very close distance range ( @xmath2015  pc ) will be included in the catalog .",
    "their completeness will however be very high because the proper motion bias excludes less than @xmath228 of the stars within that distance range . in any case",
    ", the different survey volumes for early - type and late - type stars means that our survey favors the former over the latter by a factor of about 35 to 1 .",
    "it is thus no surprise that our spectroscopic catalog is dominated by early - type m dwarfs",
    ".    an important result of our spectroscopic analysis is the identification of systematic errors in the spectral indices , which measure the strenghts of the cah , tio , and vo molecular bands .",
    "systematic offsets between data obtained at mdm observatory and at the university of hawaii 2.2-meter telescopes , as well as offsets between these and the values measured for the sames stars in the palomar - msu survey of @xcite , indicate that these spectral indices are susceptible to spectral resolution and spectrophotometric calibration , such that using the raw measurements may result in systematic errors in evaluating spectral subtypes and the metallicity @xmath4 parameter .",
    "in section 3.2 we outline a procedure for calculating corrected indices , based on a calibration of systematic offsets between two observatories .",
    "a proper calibration requires that large numbers of stars be re - observed every time a new observatory and/or instrumental setup is used , in order to calibrate the offsets and correct the spectral indices .",
    "only the corrected spectral indices can be used reliably in the spectral subtype and @xmath4 relationships , which are calibrated with respect to the corrected values .",
    "we adopt the palomar - msu measurement as our standard of reference for the spectral indices , and correct our mdm and uh values accordingly .    in the end",
    ", this catalog provides a useful list of targets for exoplanet searches , especially those based on the radial velocity variation method .",
    "current methods and instruments require relatively bright stars to be efficient , and the stars presented in our spectroscopic catalog all constitute targets of choice , having been vetted for background source contamination .",
    "our accurate spectral types will be useful to guide radial velocity surveys and selct stars of comparatively lower masses .",
    "we also provide diagnostics for chromospheric activity from h@xmath8 emission , x - ray flux excess , and uv excess .",
    "besides being useful to identify more challenging sources for radial velocity surveys , they also isolate the younger stars in the census .",
    "follow - up radial velocity observations could tie some of the stars to nearby moving groups , and these objects would be prime targets for exoplanet searches with direct imaging methods .",
