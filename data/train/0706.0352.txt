    "quantum state transfer ( qst ) , i.e. , the transfer of an arbitrary quantum state @xmath0 from one qubit to another , is an important element in quantum computation and quantum communication @xcite . the most direct method to implement qst",
    "is based on swap operations @xcite .",
    "this approach consist of a series of swap operations between neighboring qubits until the quantum state arrives at the target qubit . in a general - purpose quantum",
    "register , these quantum gates require the application of single- as well as two qubit operations . for longer distances , the number of such operations can become quite large ; it may then be advantageous to rely on quantum teleportation instead @xcite , which requires fewer gate operations , but shared entanglement between sender and receiver .    for specific systems , it is possible to transfer quantum information without applying gate operations , but instead relying on a static coupling network @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty with this approach is the required precision with which the couplings have to be realized in order to generate a transfer with high fidelity .",
    "this requirement can be relaxed significantly , without compromising the fidelity of the transfer , by applying gate operations to the receiving end of the spin chain that effects the transfer @xcite .",
    "the capability for applying such gate operations is not an additional requirement , since such operations are required anyway if the spin chain is to be used for communication between quantum registers .",
    "this gate accumulates any amplitude of the initial state that is transferred along the chain .",
    "the protocol allows one , in principle , to obtain unit fidelity for the transfer , even if the couplings along the chain have arbitrary fluctuations , as long as a finite amplitude reaches the end of the chain .",
    "obtaining a large transfer amplitude requires multiple iterations , each of which includes the evolution of the spin chain and the two - qubit gate operation .",
    "the fidelity for transfer increases with the number of the iterations and can approach @xmath1 asymptotically . hence we refer to this protocol as the iterative quantum state transfer ( iqst ) . in this paper",
    "we implement the protocol in an nmr quantum information processor and demonstrate its basic feasibility .",
    "we illustrate the iqst proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite using a system of three spins coupled by heisenberg xy- interactions , as shown in figure [ cha ] .",
    "the spin chain consists of spins @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which are coupled by a constant ( time - independent ) interaction .",
    "spin 3 is the target spin used to receive the transferred quantum state .",
    "the interaction between spins @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be switched on and off .",
    "our purpose is to transfer an arbitrary quantum state @xmath0 from spin @xmath1 to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are two complex numbers normalized to @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the the spin chain without the end qubit is @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the coupling strength .",
    "the hamiltonian of spins @xmath2 and @xmath3 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is @xmath11 when the interaction is switched on and @xmath12 otherwise .",
    "the purpose of the iqst algorithm is the transfer of an arbitrary state @xmath0 from the start of the chain ( qubit 1 ) to the end ( qubit 3 ) .",
    "we start the discussion by choosing as the initial state of the complete 3-qubit system the state @xmath13 , i.e. a product state with spin @xmath1 in state @xmath0 , and spins @xmath2 and @xmath3 in @xmath14 . transferring",
    "the @xmath15 part of the input state is trivial , since spins 1 and 3 are in the same state and this state is invariant under the @xmath16 interaction .",
    "we therefore only have to consider the @xmath17 part .",
    "the chosen initial state of the spin chain is not unique .",
    "we could , e.g. , choose to start with the total system in @xmath18 .",
    "in this case , the @xmath19 is invariant and only the transfer of the @xmath15 part needs to be considered . at the end of this section , we discuss additional possibilities .    the iterative transfer scheme of burgarth et al .",
    "consists of a continuous evolution under the spin - chain hamiltonian , interrupted by successive applications of the end - gate operation .",
    "we write the transfer operator as @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the evolution of the spin chain and @xmath22 the end gate operation . here",
    ", @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 represents the iteration step .",
    "the parameters @xmath26 are related by the unitarity condition @xmath27 . for each step of the iteration , they are equal to the coefficients of the relevant states @xmath28 and @xmath29 just before the gate is applied . under this condition , @xmath30 i.e. the transfer to the final state @xmath29 is maximized .    during the @xmath31 step , the two coefficients are @xmath32 @xmath33      after @xmath34 iterations , @xmath35 is transferred to @xmath36 apparently , the transfer increases monotonically with the number of iterations and can asymptotically approach unity provided @xmath37 . writing @xmath38 for the overlap of the system with the target state",
    ", we find @xmath39    eq .",
    "( [ e.tk ] ) implies that only the spin chain or the end gate are active at a given time .",
    "if the spin chain interactions are static ( not switchable ) , this can only be realized approximately if the coupling between the two end - gate qubits is much stronger than the couplings in the spin chain , @xmath40 . in the nmr system , we instead refocus the spin - chain interaction during the application of the end - gate operation to better approximate the ideal operation @xmath41 where @xmath42      the iqst algorithm works also when the spin chain is in a suitable mixed state . as an example , we choose @xmath43 .",
    "the second and third qubit can be chosen in any combination of @xmath14 and @xmath44 . here , we implement all four possibilities in parallel @xcite by putting qubits 2 and 3 into the maximally mixed state @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the unit operator and the upper index labels the qubit .",
    "the sample thus contains an equal number of molecules with qubits in the states @xmath47    if the system is initially in one of the states @xmath48 , it acquires an overall phase factor of @xmath49 during the transfer . combining this with the results of sec .",
