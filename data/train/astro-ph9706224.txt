    "quasar absorption lines provide a powerful tool for probing the evolution of the universe from @xmath8 = 0 to 5 , but to correctly interpret this information , one must understand the nature of the absorbers .",
    "studies with the ghrs have yielded important results on the nature of low redshift `` ly@xmath0 clouds , '' low column density gas clouds which produce h i ly@xmath0 absorption lines in the spectra of background qsos ( see morris 1996 for a brief review ) .",
    "ghrs observations of 3c273 shortly after the deployment of hst revealed that there are considerably more ly@xmath0 clouds at low redshift than expected based on the observed evolution of the number of clouds per unit redshift ( @xmath9 ) at high @xmath8 ( morris et al .",
    "1991 ; see also the fos study of bahcall et al .",
    "this abundance of low @xmath8 clouds provides an opportunity to learn about the nature of the absorbers by _ directly _ studying the environment ( i.e. , galaxies , galaxy clusters , voids , etc . ) where the ly@xmath0 clouds are found .",
    "studies of the relationship between low @xmath8 ly@xmath0 clouds and galaxies using the ghrs have been carried out by morris et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , stocke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and shull , stocke , & penton ( 1996 ) . these programs",
    "find that ( 1 ) ly@xmath0 clouds are not randomly distributed with respect to galaxies , but the absorber - galaxy correlation is not as strong as the galaxy - galaxy correlation , and ( 2 ) some ly@xmath0 clouds are found in galaxy voids , although overall the clouds tend to `` avoid the voids . '' in general , the ly@xmath0 clouds studied with ghrs do not have nearby associated galaxies ; morris et al .",
    "( 1993 ) report that there are no galaxies observed within 230 kpc of any of the 3c273 ly@xmath0 clouds , and stocke et al .",
    "find that there are no galaxies within 450 kpc of their ly@xmath0 absorbers .",
    "these ghrs results seem to be in conflict with hst fos studies of ly@xmath0 clouds .",
    "for example , based on a redshift survey of galaxies near qsos observed with the fos , lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find that 32 - 60% of the ly@xmath0 clouds in their sample are associated with luminous galaxies within @xmath7 160 kpc of the qso sight lines . to reconcile these discordant results ,",
    "it has been suggested that there are two populations of ly@xmath0 clouds at low redshift : ( 1 ) strong ly@xmath0 clouds with @xmath10(h i ) @xmath11 @xmath12 which dominate the ly@xmath0 cloud sample of lanzetta et al . and mostly occur in large halos of luminous galaxies , and ( 2 ) lower column density absorbers which are less closely tied to galaxies and are , in some cases , truly intergalactic gas clouds ( the morris et al . and stocke et al .",
    "ly@xmath0 clouds have @xmath10(h i ) @xmath13 @xmath12 . )",
    "currently this suggestion can not be rigorously tested , however , because the sample of weaker ly@xmath0 clouds is small .    to significantly improve the statistics of low redshift _ weak _",
    "ly@xmath0 clouds , we are conducting a program to study the relationship between low @xmath8 ly@xmath0 clouds and galaxies in the direction of three qsos using the ghrs and the wiyn multiobject spectrograph ( hydra ) . using the g140l grating",
    ", we will obtain ghrs spectra with s / n @xmath2 100:1 , adequate for detection of ly@xmath0 clouds with @xmath14 = 50 m  ( 4@xmath5 ) , and this will increase the _ weak _ ly@xmath0 cloud sample size by a factor of 4 - 5 .",
    "the wiyn hydra will be used to measure the redshifts of galaxies in the @xmath15 fields centered on the qsos .",
    "figure 1 shows a portion of the ghrs spectrum of h 1821 + 643 ( @xmath1 = 0.297 ) obtained for this program .",
    "the wiyn galaxy redshift survey for this field has been completed , and the full analysis of the ghrs and wiyn data for this sight line will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "some preliminary results are summarized below .",
    "the o vi 1031.9 , 1037.6   doublet is well - detected at @xmath6 = 0.2250 in the h 1821 + 643 spectrum ( see figure 1 ) along with h i ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath16 , and we have g160 m ( fwhm = 15 km s@xmath3 ) ghrs observations of the o vi 1031.9   and h i ly@xmath16 absorption profiles obtained in the galactic ism program of savage et al . ( 1995 ) .",
    "these g160 m profiles are well - described by voigt profiles with the parameters listed in table 1 .",
    "the width of the o vi profile indicates that @xmath17k , and the redshift difference between the h i and o vi profiles implies a 40 km s@xmath3 centroid shift between the neutral and highly ionized gas .",
    "the h i ly@xmath0 profile shows complex component structure ( see figure 2 ) , and some of this structure could be due to a broad hot h i component associated with the o vi .",
    "lccc species & redshift & log @xmath10 ( @xmath12 ) & @xmath18 ( km s@xmath3 ) + h i ly@xmath16 & 0.224892@xmath190.000008 & 15.32@xmath190.07 & 50.7@xmath193.2 + o vi & 0.225026@xmath190.000010 & 14.29@xmath190.03 & 42.8@xmath193.5 +    schneider et al .",
    "( 1992 ) have detected an emission line galaxy at @xmath8 = 0.2256 within 90 kpc of the sight line .",
    "our wiyn redshift survey has discovered another emission line galaxy close to the sight line at @xmath8 = 0.2263 .",
    "therefore it is possible that the o vi absorption at @xmath8 = 0.2250 originates in the intracluster medium of a group of galaxies .",
    "the absorption profiles of three out of the four strongest h i ly@xmath0 lines contain complex component structure with a main strong component and several weaker outlying components spanning @xmath71000 - 1500 km s@xmath3 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "even the ly@xmath0 line at @xmath6 = 0.1699 which does not show resolved weak components has an asymmetric profile which is evidence of unresolved profile components .",
    "this seems to suggest that there is some clustering of weak ly@xmath0 clouds at low redshift . however , we have calculated the two - point correlation function using all of the ly@xmath0 clouds detected in the h 1821 + 643 ghrs spectrum , and this does not show evidence of clustering on any scale , but the sample of ly@xmath0 lines may be too small for adequate statistics .",
