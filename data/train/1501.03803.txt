    "the spectral lines of doubly - ionised oxygen , o@xmath0 , are important diagnostic tools in a variety of astronomical and astrophysical situations , such as solar and nebular studies , due to the abundance of this ion in these environments and the brightness of a number of its lines @xcite .",
    "they are used for instance to determine the oxygen abundance and other physical conditions in the milky way and other galaxies out to substantial cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "there has been a recent advocation @xcite of the use of non maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) electron energy distributions in the analysis of the spectra of planetary nebulae ( pne ) and h  ii  regions .",
    "it has been proposed that the discrepancy between the results for elemental abundance and electron temperature obtained from the optical recombination lines ( orls ) and those obtained from the collisionally - excited lines ( cels ) could be resolved if the free electron energies are described by a @xmath1-distribution @xcite rather than a mb one .",
    "@xcite attempted to test this hypothesis using a subset of dielectronic recombination lines to directly sample the free electron energy distribution .",
    "no evidence was found for departures from a mb distribution in a small sample of pne but the uncertainties in the observational data made it impossible to rule out such departures .",
    "@xcite modelled the shape of the balmer continuum in the spectra of a sample of pne and concluded that both a model comprising two mb distributions of different temperatures or @xmath1-distributions matched the spectra within the observational errors .",
    "however , @xcite carried out the same modelling on the extreme pn , hf 2 - 2 , and concluded that the probability that the spectrum corresponds to a @xmath1-distribution is extremely low .",
    "the present paper is part of a series of papers by the authors intended to make possible a spectroscopic investigation of whether a @xmath1 electron energy distribution can provide a consistent explanation of the spectra of the thin and relatively cold plasma found in planetary nebulae and h  ii  regions .",
    "the [ o  iii ] lines are very strong in all pne and the corresponding recombination lines of o  ii  have also been recorded in many nebulae exhibiting varying degrees of disagreement between orl and cel abundances and temperatures .",
    "indeed , the abundances derived from the [ o  iii ] forbidden lines and from the o  ii  recombination lines are one of the primary sources for the orl / cel discrepancy .",
    "we therefore aim to provide in this series of papers @xmath1-dependent recombination coefficients for h  i  and o  ii  and @xmath1-dependent collision strengths for the electron excitation and de - excitation of the [ o  iii ] lines . with these theoretical data",
    "we aim to answer the question whether any single @xmath1-distribution can explain the relative intensities of the [ o  iii ] forbidden lines and corresponding o  ii  recombination lines in a range of pne and , if so , what is the resulting o@xmath0/h abundance ratio .    in @xcite",
    "the available theoretical parameters for electron collisional excitation of the [ o  iii ] forbidden lines were investigated and new collision strength data for the ten transitions between the five lowest levels of the ground configuration were generated using a breit - pauli relativistic model .",
    "in @xcite the @xmath1-distributed hydrogen recombination data were provided .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate @xmath1-distributed effective collision strengths of the [ o  iii ] forbidden transitions .",
    "what remains is the o  ii  recombination with a @xmath1 electron distribution which will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "there are a considerable number of studies dealing with the collision strengths of o@xmath0  and their thermally - averaged values ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , most of the past studies provided a limited amount of effective collision strength data ; moreover , except the last one , the provided data are based on a maxwell - boltzmann electron energy distribution .",
    "@xcite reviewed the existing theoretical work and concluded that there is good agreement between their new collision strength results and all the past high - quality calculations .",
    "however , they found significant differences with the work of @xcite which , they argued , were probably due to the small number of target states used by those authors , omitting key terms of the 2p@xmath2 electron configuration . the most recent work of @xcite also uses a limited number of target states which omits the 2p@xmath2 terms and the calculations were made with an implementation of the intermediate coupling frame transformation ( icft ) method of @xcite which is potentially problematic for the deeply closed channels that are encountered in low energy scattering from o@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have suggested that the be - sequence icft calculations of @xcite might be unreliable due to their use of the icft method , quoting @xcite as evidence of potential problems .",
    "it is important to emphasise that the problems encountered in the icft calculations for o@xmath3 scattering were due to a specific combination of circumstances and can not be assumed to have occurred for any previous icft work . in the icft approach , closed channel wavefunctions are integrated inwards to the boundary of the r - matrix inner region .",
    "the target orbitals in the o@xmath3 calculation of @xcite were very compact , comprising only @xmath4 spectroscopic orbitals and short range @xmath5 and @xmath6 correlation orbitals . for low charge ions ,",
    "deeply closed channels with small effective quantum number can arise and for o@xmath3 the inward integration of these deeply closed channels to small values of radius developed significant exponentially growing terms which distorted the results .    in figure  [ plotmebupsilon152 ]",
    "we compare the mb - averaged collision strengths for the @xmath7p@xmath8 ",
    "@xmath9s@xmath8 transition from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite with those of @xcite as a function of electron temperature . as in @xcite",
    "we show the percentage difference from the @xcite results in each case .",
    "the values plotted for @xcite were calculated by us from their collision strength data as privately supplied to us . as with the @xcite results ,",
    "the @xcite values differ significantly from those of @xcite and previous large scale calculations .",
    "a possible source of the difference between the results of @xcite and @xcite is that the latter s collision strengths extend to a higher energy than the former s .",
    "however , on truncating the energy range of the @xcite collision strengths to the same range used by @xcite we found that the effective collision strengths are only marginally different in the temperature range 10020000  k. we therefore continue to maintain the view expressed by @xcite that there is no reason to believe that the consensus of the results of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , which all agree within 10% , is in error . a similar pattern is seen in the other forbidden transitions among the lowest five levels .",
    "the electron impact collision strength , @xmath10 , is a dimensionless quantity used to quantify the intrinsic probability of collisional excitation and de - excitation in an atomic transition at a particular electron energy .",
    "the effective collision strength is defined as the collision strength averaged with respect to an electron energy distribution function , and hence it is obtained by convolving the collision strength with a distribution function .",
    "the effective collision strength of electron excitation , @xmath11 , from a lower state @xmath12 to an upper state @xmath13 is defined by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the effective temperature , @xmath16 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the free electron energy relative to the states @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the energy difference between the two atomic states , @xmath21 is the collision strength of the transition between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 states , and @xmath22 is the electron energy distribution function .",
    "similarly , the effective collision strength of electron de - excitation , @xmath23{180}{$\\upsilon$}}$ ] , from an upper state @xmath13 to a lower state @xmath12 of a species is given by    @xmath24{180}{$\\upsilon$}}_{j\\rightarrow i}=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\omega_{ij}(\\epsilon_{j } ) \\left(\\frac{k_{_b}t}{\\epsilon_{j}}\\right)^{1/2}f(\\epsilon_{j})\\,\\,d\\epsilon_{j}\\ ] ]    the electron distribution function is usually assumed a maxwell - boltzmann which is given by    @xmath25    based on a thermodynamic equilibrium state .",
    "similar thermal - averaging procedures with respect to other electron distribution functions can also apply to reflect non - equilibrium states .",
    "the most widely used non - equilibrium distribution function is the @xmath1 distribution which is given , in one of its common forms , by @xcite    @xmath26    where @xmath1 is a parameter characterising the distribution and takes values in the interval @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the gamma function of the given arguments .",
    "it should be remarked that @xmath11 and @xmath23{180}{$\\upsilon$}}$ ] are identical , by definition , for the maxwell - boltzmann distribution but are generally different for other types of electron distribution function such as the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "also , the @xmath1 distribution converges to the maxwell - boltzmann distribution for large values of @xmath1 although in many cases the convergence practically occurs at moderate values of @xmath1 .",
    "we use the previously published raw collision strength data of @xcite .",
    "these were generated using a 72-term atomic target with the breit - pauli hamiltonian terms in the intermediate coupling approximation as implemented in the ucl - belfast - strathclyde r - matrix code @xcite .",
    "the limits of the effective collision strength data are the same as the limits of the original raw collision strength data that is : the data are related only to the ten transitions between the five lowest levels of the ion and a free electron excitation energy up to about 1.3  rydberg .",
    "this provides effective collision strengths with a temperature up to 25000  k. these limits were adopted mainly for the relevance of the data to thin and relatively cold plasma found in planetary nebulae and h  ii  regions .",
    "@xcite have presented some graphical comparisons of collision strengths averaged over @xmath1-distributions for some [ o  iii ] transitions but very limited numerical results and only for mb distributions .",
    "our data are therefore the first comprehensive set of its kind in the public domain as far as we know .    the data set accompanying",
    "this paper consists of ten @xmath11 files and ten @xmath23{180}{$\\upsilon$}}$ ] files where each file is dedicated to one of the ten possible transitions between the five lowest levels of o@xmath0  as given in table  [ levelstable ] . in this regard we define a scaled upsilon quantity , @xmath29 , by @xmath30 to compensate for the large values of @xmath11 when @xmath15 is low and @xmath19 is large .",
    "we also impose a cut - off limit for the acceptance of the scaled upsilon values ; the essence of this condition is that any value that falls below @xmath31 of the corresponding value at @xmath32  k for the given @xmath1 should be dropped .",
    "we use the indicator `` 99999999 '' to mark these dropped entries for the purpose of keeping the rectangular structure of these tables .",
    "the physical basis for imposing the cut - off condition is that since the scaled upsilon is proportional to the excitation rate coefficient , apart from a @xmath33 factor , there is no practical use of the excitation rate if it is very small compared to the generally - accepted standard thermal condition in photoionised nebulae which is an mb distribution at @xmath32  k.    the collisional excitation rate coefficients , @xmath34 , can be obtained from the scaled upsilons , @xmath29 , using the following formula @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the statistical weight of state @xmath12 , @xmath37 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath38 is the fine structure constant , @xmath39 is the bohr radius , and @xmath40 is the rydberg energy constant and where the temperature is in kelvin .",
    "similarly , the collisional de - excitation rate coefficients , @xmath41 , can be obtained from the downsilons , @xmath23{180}{$\\upsilon$}}$ ] , using the following formula @xmath42{180}{$\\upsilon$}}\\simeq \\frac{8.629\\times10^{-6 } { \\rotatebox[origin = c]{180}{$\\upsilon$}}}{\\omega_j \\sqrt{t } } \\ \\ { \\rm ( cgs\\,\\,units)}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the statistical weight of state @xmath13 .    in each one of the aforementioned files ,",
    "the 10-based logarithm of the effective collision strengths , @xmath29 and @xmath23{180}{$\\upsilon$}}$ ] , are tabulated in a rectangular array where the columns represent 10-based logarithmic electron temperatures [ log@xmath44=2.0(0.025)4.3 ] while the rows represent @xmath1 which ranges between @xmath45 in unevenly - spaced periods [ 1.600(0.025)1.975 , 2.0(0.1)2.9 , 3.0(0.2)4.8 , 5.0(0.5)9.5 , 10(1)19 , 20(2.5)47.5 , 50(5)95 , 100(25)175 , 200(50)450 , 500(100)900 , 1000(1000)5000 , 10000 , 50000 , 100000 and 1000000 ] .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath1 grids are constructed to satisfy the condition that the maximum percentage error in @xmath29 or @xmath23{180}{$\\upsilon$}}$ ] from linear interpolation as a function of @xmath15 or @xmath1 , between any two consecutive log@xmath46 values in the data files , should not exceed 1% at the mid - point .",
    "more details about the interpolation errors for these tables are given in table [ errortable ] .",
    "the structure and contents of the data files are fully explained in the readme file that associates the data set .",
    "a sample of these data for the 1 - 5 transition are presented in table [ tableup15 ] for the logarithmic scaled upsilon and in table [ tabledo15 ] for the logarithmic downsilon .    in figure  [ contourplots ]",
    "we show contour plots of @xmath47 as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath48 for three representative transitions . in this and",
    "subsequent contour plots the values are base 10 logarithms of the relevant quantity , normalised to the value for an mb distribution at @xmath49  k , which we will refer to as the `` standard pn conditions '' .",
    "the plotted quantity is proportional to the excitation rate coefficient for each transition .",
    "the 1 - 4 transition is one of the means of exciting level 4 , the @xmath9d@xmath50 level , which gives rise to the important @xmath51 lines .",
    "the plot for this transition shows that the 1 - 4 excitation rate coefficient at @xmath49  k is largely insensitive to the value of @xmath1 for values of @xmath1 larger than about 3 .",
    "the picture is different for the 1 - 5 transition which excites the @xmath52 line which , by comparison with the @xmath51 lines is a temperature diagnostic .",
    "the contour plot for this transition shows that the excitation rate coefficient is sensitive to @xmath1 in such a way that the standard pn value can occur at lower temperatures as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "hence we can expect that the ratio of the intensities of the lines from level 4 and 5 , which are commonly used as a temperature diagnostic , will also be sensitive to the value of @xmath1 .    in figure  [ tempcontour ]",
    "we show a contour plot of the principal [ o  iii ] temperature diagnostic , the ratio of the sum of the emission coefficients , @xmath53 , of the two lines @xmath54 to the @xmath55 line at an electron number density of @xmath49  @xmath56 .",
    "the emission coefficients were computed using a model atom comprising the five energetically lowest levels , and only electron collisional excitation and de - excitation and spontaneous radiative transitions were included .",
    "the radiative transition probabilities were taken from @xcite , which we prefer to the more recent calculations of @xcite for o@xmath0 since the former calculation incorporates relativistic corrections to the magnetic dipole operator .",
    "adding these corrections yields a more accurate value for the well observed @xmath57 , @xmath58 branching ratio which was in disagreement with theory until the work of @xcite .",
    "the plot shows that the loci of the values of temperature and @xmath1 where the mb value is reproduced always lies at lower temperatures as @xmath1 decreases and the distribution moves away from mb .",
    "for example , the predicted `` standard '' value for the line ratio of 194 is also obtained at @xmath59  k when @xmath60 .",
    "the predicted line intensities are much lower at @xmath61  k than at the standard temperature of @xmath49  k , so the number density of o@xmath0 ions implied by a given measured line flux is larger .    in figure  [ abundancecontour ]",
    "we show a contour plot of the o@xmath0 number density , assuming a fixed intensity for the @xmath62 line , as a function of temperature and @xmath1 . for the example",
    "above , we find that at @xmath59  k and @xmath60 the number density is 3.2 times larger than that derived for standard conditions .",
    "the general conclusion therefore is that the observed optical [ o  iii ] line ratios can be modelled using a non - mb @xmath1-distribution but with lower temperature and higher derived o@xmath0 number density .",
    ".the five lowest energy levels of o@xmath0  with their experimental energies , @xmath63 , in wavenumbers ( @xmath64 ) . these values were obtained from the national institute of standards and technology database ( www.nist.gov ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]"
