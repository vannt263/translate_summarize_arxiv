    "symmetries and invariance properties are among the most characteristic features of any physical system . they usually give a deeper insight into the physical nature of the problem , but also help their mathematical formulation .",
    "symmetries typically lead to characteristic patterns in the energy spectrum of the system .",
    "these features are shared by the `` classic '' potential problems of non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "technically these are relatively simple systems , and accordingly they include a number of exactly solvable examples , nevertheless , they represent the showcase of a wide variety of symmetry and invariance concepts .",
    "the most widely known symmetries of quantum mechanical potentials are based on group theory ( in particular , lie algebras ) , supersymmetry and @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "group theoretical approaches to quantum mechanical problems and potentials in particular , are practically as old as quantum mechanics itself .",
    "the elements of the ( symmetry , spectrum generating , dynamical @xcite and potential @xcite ) algebras typically connect different eigenstates of the same hamiltonian or some interrelated hamiltonians , while the states themselves belong to the irreducible representations of the corresponding group .    a less immediate application of the concept of symmetry appears in supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susyqm ) @xcite , where the supersymmetry relates two hamiltonians which typically have identical spectra except , possibly , the ground state of one of the hamiltonians which is missing from the spectrum of the other one .",
    "for traditional reasons these two hamiltonians are called the `` bosonic '' and the `` fermionic '' hamiltonians and are denoted with the ``  '' and `` + '' indices . in susyqm",
    "they are constructed from two linear first - order differential equations as @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "susyqm is essentially a reformulation of the factorization technique which is an old method of generating isospectral potentials @xcite .",
    "the most recent symmetry concept is the so called @xmath1 symmetry of one - dimensional quantum mechanical potentials .",
    "it has several relevant and interesting implications regarding the energy spectrum . in @xmath2",
    "symmetric quantum mechanics of bender and boettcher @xcite the potentials are invariant under the simultaneous action of the space and time reflection operations @xmath8 and @xmath5 , and have the property @xmath9^*=v(x)$ ] .",
    "a peculiar feature of these models is that although they are not hermitian , they may possess real bound - state energy spectrum .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath1 symmetric potentials may support eigenvalues arranged into complex conjugate pairs @xcite , but then the energy eigenfunctions cease to be eigenfunctions of the @xmath2 operator , and the emergence of a complex energy can be interpreted as a manifestation of the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath1 symmetry .    in the above symmetry - based scenario occurring in numerous applications of quantum mechanics",
    "an interplay may be noticed between different symmetry concepts .",
    "for example , the practical identity of the supersymmetric shift operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the ladder operators of some potential algebras has been established @xcite in the case of potential families corresponding to type a and b factorizations @xcite .",
    "similarly , in spite of the comparative novelty of the @xmath2 symmetric quantum mechanics , some standard lie - algebraic methods found already their inspiring applications within its non - standard framework .",
    "some solvable @xmath1 symmetric potentials have been associated with the sl(2,@xmath12 ) @xcite , su(1,1)@xmath13so(2,1 ) @xcite and so(2,2 ) @xcite potential algebras .",
    "the relationship between the supersymmetric and @xmath1 symmetric considerations may still be felt as a certain  missing link \" .",
    "this motivated our forthcoming analysis .",
    "firstly , on the background of @xcite we imagined that there exist essential differences between any hermitian and non - hermitian versions of the supersymmetric formalism .",
    "we believe that it deserves a deeper study , first of all , via particular examples . secondly , we were always aware that more attention has to be paid to one of the most specific features of the @xmath1 symmetric hamiltonians , namely , to the existence of the so called quasi - parity quantum number @xmath14 which , roughly speaking , reflects the emergence of new normalizable states during the transition from the hermitian to non - hermitian @xmath15 .",
    "this extension of the basis states has already been investigated in an algebraic formalism @xcite .",
    "last but not least , we were encouraged by the increasing number of the available @xmath16 symmetric examples where the reality of spectra was explained using techniques of susyqm  @xcite .    in our paper we shall pay more attention to the recent observation @xcite that the quasi - parity may play a key role in the latter context .",
    "we are going to emphasize that in a way which extends the scope of the latter reference , the formal changes of the susyqm rules in the non - hermitian case are _ not _ an artifact of the presence of the singularities in the complex plane of @xmath17 .",
    "for the sake of clarity of our argument we shall pick up first one characteristic potential ( often called scarf ii ) and summarize its known properties in section 2 .",
    "section 3 is then devoted to its deeper analysis .",
    "we shall see that the supersymmetrization of this potential in its fully regular @xmath2 symmetric version exhibits some properties which make it very different from its stardard treatment within the hermitian susyqm .",
    "the respective discussion and summary of our findings are finally collected in sections 4 and  5 .",
    "in a way which reflects the innovative character of the @xmath16 symmetric models , many of their studies focused on a particular potential . the first examples of these potentials have even been found using perturbation techniques @xcite .",
    "further ones have been identified using semiclassical approximations @xcite and numerical algorithms @xcite .",
    "a number of the exactly solvable @xmath2 symmetric potentials have been revealed as the analogues of their hermitian , real special cases @xcite .",
    "in such a setting we shall pick up the scarf ii potential @xmath18 + \\frac{2{\\rm i}\\sinh x}{\\cosh^2 x } \\left(\\frac{\\beta+\\alpha}{2}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{\\beta-\\alpha}{2}\\right )   \\label{vscarf}\\ ] ] as a typical illustration of the generic relations between the concept of @xmath2 symmetry and certain susyqm constructions .",
    "the scarf ii potential seems to be an ideal example for such a purpose since    * it is one of the shape - invariant potentials @xcite which , in the susyqm context , belongs to type a factorization @xcite ; * its general functional form contains its hermitian version ( for @xmath19 @xcite ) as well as its @xmath1 symmetric one ( for @xmath20 and @xmath21 both real or imaginary @xcite ) ; * in contrast with many @xmath1 symmetric potentials generated from the singular hermitian potentials , its analysis @xcite does not require any artificial regularization ; * the spontaneous breakdown of its @xmath1 symmetry @xcite occurs simply due to a change of one of its real parameters to an imaginary value .    before addressing the details",
    "we note that our notation can easily be transformed to that used in the other works .",
    "thus , we might put @xmath22/4 $ ] and @xmath23 in @xcite , @xmath24 and @xmath25 in @xcite and @xmath26 and @xmath27 in @xcite .",
    "the conventional hermitian version of the scarf ii potential @xcite is obtained when the second term in ( [ vscarf ] ) is made real by the @xmath28 parametrization , for example .",
    "one then finds the bound - state ( normalizable ) solutions at the energies @xmath29 with the corresponding wavefunctions expressed in terms of jacobi polynomials as @xmath30 we note that although the scarf ii ( or gendenshtein ) potential has been known for some time , the normalization constant @xmath31 were determined only recently in @xcite .",

    "this mimics the spatial reflection operation @xmath8 and has no effect on the energy spectrum .",
    "a simple calculation based on the properties of jacobi polynomials reveals that the interchange @xmath33 acts as a spatial reflection on the wavefunctions ( [ ofscarf ] ) , up to an unimportant sign change @xmath34 in their norm  @xcite .",
    "we note that equations ( [ vscarf ] ) , ( [ oescarf ] ) , ( [ ofscarf ] ) and ( [ oncond ] ) apply to the general complex version of the scarf ii potential too , although in this case further refining of the formalism might become necessary , as we shall see in the next subsection .      in the light of the review",
    "@xcite the @xmath1 symmetric version of the scarf ii potential is obtained if @xmath35 and @xmath36 holds , i.e. if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are both either real or imaginary .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are all real , and the @xmath2 symmetry is unbroken , if both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are real .",
    "when one of the two parameters is real and the other one is imaginary , then the energy eigenvalues appear in complex conjugate pairs , and this case corresponds to the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath1 symmetry @xcite .",
    "if both parameters are imaginary , then there are no normalizable states due to the constraint  ( [ oncond ] ) .    based on the practical equivalence of @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ", we can assume without any loss of generality that @xmath21 is real and @xmath20 is either real or imaginary , depending on whether we study unbroken or spontaneously broken @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "a remarkable feature of @xmath1 symmetric potentials is that the range of their normalizable states is broader than that of their hermitian counterparts . in case of the scarf ii potential",
    "this is reflected by the fact that both @xmath20 and @xmath37 can appear in eqs .",
    "( [ ofscarf ] ) , ( [ oescarf ] ) and ( [ oncond ] ) , since the potential ( [ vscarf ] ) is invariant under the @xmath38 transformation .",
    "the dual admissible sign of @xmath20 may be called a quasi - parity quantum number @xcite @xmath0 .",
    "this makes the scarf ii potential similar to other @xmath1 symmetric potentials , which also have a second set of bound - state solutions compared to their hermitian versions .",
    "however , the mechanism of the appearance of the second set is different from the scenario typical for the singular potentials where the singularity is cancelled by the @xmath1 symmetric regularization procedure .",
    "now the new states  evolve \" from states that already existed as resonances in the hermitian limit @xcite , so that their emergence is not directly related to the less strict boundary conditions .    in what follows",
    "we shall modify our notation slightly and replace @xmath20 with @xmath39 , where @xmath0 is the quasi - parity .",
    "this implies a redefinition of the formulae used previously as    @xmath40    @xmath41    the number of bound states contained in the two sets depends on @xmath14 because the condition for normalizability is also modified accordingly , @xmath42/2\\ .",
    "\\label{ncond } \\label{qncond}\\ ] ] in particular , when both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are real , i.e. the @xmath1 symmetry is unbroken , the bounds ( [ qncond ] ) differ in general , however , in the case of spontaneously broken @xmath2 symmetry , when @xmath20 is imaginary , the two sets contain equal number of bound states , as expected from the fact that the two sets are formed by complex conjugate energy eigenvalues .    in @xcite the normalization constants in ( [ fscarf ] ) have been determined using the modified inner product @xmath43 of @xcite .",
    "the ( [ fscarf ] ) functions were found to be orthogonal to each other using this inner product , while ( as expected for a non - hermitian problem ) , this was not the case when the standard hermitian inner product was used .",
    "the duality of normalizable solutions in the @xmath1 symmetric setting implies a duality in the superpotentials too , and this is a remarkable new feature of the supersymmetrization of @xmath1 symmetric potentials .",
    "this means that in the realization of the standard @xmath44 susyqm algebra @xcite @xmath45=[{\\cal   h},q^{\\dag}]=0 \\label{ssalg}\\ ] ] the supersymmetric charge operators @xmath46 and the supersymmetric hamiltonian @xmath47 are constructed using the susyqm shift operators @xmath48 which now depend explicitly on the quasi - parity quantum number @xmath0 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , so @xmath51 is the ground - state wavefunction of the  bosonic \" hamiltonian @xmath52 .",

    "this is one of our main observations which extends the concept of shape - invariance @xcite to @xmath2 symmetric potentials .",
    "the actual effect of the susyqm shift operators on the  bosonic \" and  fermionic \" eigenfunctions can be proven by straightforward but tedious calculations : @xmath62 @xmath63 according to ( [ ncond ] ) the two partner potentials have one less bound ( normalizable ) state than the original scarf ii potential ( [ vscarf ] ) , and a comparison with ( [ eqscarf ] ) leads to the standard susyqm result for the energy eigenvalues of the  fermionic \" sector : @xmath64    making use of the richer combination of susy shift operators and wavefunctions , we can analyse the effect of the @xmath65 operator on the `` bosonic '' eigenfunctions with opposite quasi - parity @xmath66 : @xmath67 this result indicates that the `` fermionic '' potential @xmath68 has the same number of states with @xmath66 as the original bosonic potential , and this is confirmed by a comparison between their spectra : @xmath69 the inverse operation of ( [ xapm ] ) is @xmath70 the situation is schematically illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the results in ( [ xapm ] ) and ( [ xadpp ] ) are analogous to some relations found in a susyqm inspired study of the @xmath2 symmetric spiked harmonic oscillator @xcite , and they are practically equivalent with the relations describing the effect of the two sets of so(2,1 ) generators on the two sets of solutions of the @xmath2 symmetric scarf ii potential in the algebraic analysis @xcite .",
    "it has to be added though , that the new degeneracy patterns and partnerships of potentials are not specific to the scarf ii potential , rather they are valid for any system where supersymmetry and @xmath2 symmetry appear simultaneously . to show this , we assume that similarly to the situation for the scarf ii potential , the `` bosonic '' hamiltonian @xmath57 can be made independent of the quasi - parity quantum number by applying an appropriate relative energy shift of the @xmath71 and @xmath4 sectors , i.e. @xmath72 . with this assumption the isospectrality of the two `` fermionic '' hamiltonians follows from the eigenvalue equations @xmath73\\psi^{(q)}_{n,-",

    "there is a difference between ( [ oldeig ] ) and ( [ neweig ] ) that in the former case @xmath80 by construction , so the partner of the ground - state `` bosonic '' level is missing from the `` fermionic '' hamiltonian @xmath81 , while the situation is different for ( [ neweig ] ) , so there the number of levels is the same in the `` bosonic '' and `` fermionic '' hamiltonians , just as we have seen for the example of the scarf ii potential .",
    "these considerations prove that the combination of the two symmetries leads to a richer spectral pattern than either of them separately , not only for the scarf ii potential , but also for any @xmath14-independent potentials .",
    "after one moves from the analytic to algebraic context the doubling of solutions may be seen as directly reflecting the fact that the su(1,1)@xmath82so(2,1 ) algebra associated with the solutions @xcite becomes doubled and eventually leads to a larger so(2,2 ) potential algebra of the model  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the doubling of the states is one of the key motivations of our present analysis .",
    "it indicates that instead of one susy partner , @xmath2 symmetric potentials can have two , i.e. one with @xmath3 and another with @xmath4 .",
    "similar results have been obtained for the @xmath2 symmetrized spiked harmonic oscillator in @xcite , however the visualization and transparency of the example were significantly obscured there by the presence of the essential singularity of the solutions at @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the smooth scarf ii potential is much better suited for the similar purposes .",
    "we found that the two `` fermionic '' partner hamiltonians are isospectral with the `` bosonic '' one in the sense that the spectrum of @xmath61 ( @xmath84 ) misses the level corresponding to @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) level of the `` bosonic '' hamiltonian @xmath57 .",
    "this isospectrality has been demonstrated explicitly in the case of the scarf ii potential , but we also showed that it holds for any potential characterized simultaneously by @xmath2 symmetry and supersymmetry .",
    "the situation is illustrated schematically in figure 1 .",
    "for the scarf ii potential this network of interrelated levels is practically the same as the one obtained in terms of an so(2,2 ) potential algebra @xcite , and the two sets of susy shift opetarors correspond to the two sets of so(2,1 ) ladder operators .",
    "it has to be stressed that although the spectra of hamiltonians with opposite quasi - parity are interrelated here , there is no operator which would flip the @xmath14 of a given wavefunction , so the two quasi - parity sectors remain disjoint in this sense .",
    "the results obtained for the scarf ii potential have significantly different implications for unbroken and broken @xmath1 symmetry . in the former case the  fermionic \" partner potentials ( [ vpq ] ) are @xmath1 symmetric , and the @xmath87 energy eigenvalues remain real . in the latter case , however , the coupling parameters of both the even and odd component of the potential become complex due to the imaginary value of @xmath20 , therefore the  fermionic \" potentials cease to be @xmath1 symmetric .",
    "this manifest breakdown of @xmath2 symmetry is also demonstrated by the fact that the complex energy eigenvalues cease to appear in complex conjugated pairs in the spectrum of the `` fermionic '' hamiltonians , because the equivalent of the @xmath88 `` bosonic '' state will be missing from the spectrum of the @xmath89 `` fermionic '' hamiltonian .",
    "we note that a generalized form of the @xmath1 invariant scarf ii potential can be obtained by an _",
    "imaginary _ shift of the axis of coordinates , @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "such a transformation can not influence any of the conclusions of our work since the modified potential and eigenfunctions behave in the same way under the @xmath1 transformation as the original ones , only their functional form becomes more complicated when we decide to stay on the real line and change the variables accordingly .",
    "this clarifies why the energy eigenvalues are independent of @xmath91 as well as why the change may only influence the wavefunctions and/or the reflection and transmission coefficients @xcite .",
    "turning now to more general considerations , we note that in the @xmath1 symmetric setting the supersymmetrization can be realized in an alternative way , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "in such a framework the susy algebra is to be realized by the operators that contain the antilinear @xmath92 operation explicitly .",
    "one need not even use any particular potential to reveal the relation of this scheme to the conventional one @xcite .",
    "it suffices to recollect that the susy charge and shift operators may contain the time reflection ( i.e. , complex conjugation ) operator @xmath93 , say , in the form @xmath94 consequently , the susy hamiltonian is different in its  fermionic \" component @xmath95 this indicates that the  bosonic \" component of the modified hamiltonian is the same as in the original case ( [ sham ] ) , @xmath96 , while the `` fermionic '' component of the modified hamiltonian coincides with the complex conjugate of the original  fermionic \" hamiltonian @xmath97 .",

    "i.e. when the energy eigenvalues are real and consequently @xmath100 is also real , this means that the energy eigenvalues of @xmath101 are also real , while for spontaneously broken @xmath2 symmetry , when the energy eigenvalues and @xmath100 are complex , the energy eigenvalues of @xmath101 are the complex conjugates of the eigenvalues of @xmath61 . the eigenfunctions are equally trivially related to the original  fermionic \" eigenfunctions in both cases .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath1 invariance leads to a special relation between the @xmath8 and @xmath5 operations themselves .",
    "if @xmath61 is @xmath1 symmetric , then the complex conjugation operation has the same effect on it as the @xmath8 spatial reflexion operation , so @xmath101 contains the spatially reflected potential appearing in @xmath61 , so the modified susy construction does not differ essentially from the usual one .",
    "a similar relation holds between the eigenfunctions , if they are eigenfunctions of the @xmath1 operator , i.e. if the @xmath2 symmetry is unbroken .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of @xmath101 are real and the same as those of @xmath61 , as we have seen above . in the case of",
    "spontaneously broken @xmath1 symmetry the situation is different since the eigenfunctions are not invariant under the @xmath1 operation anymore .",
    "the energy eigenvalues remain the same since the complex conjugate pairs simply transform into themselves under complex conjugation .",
    "however , in the case of the spontaneously broken @xmath1 symmetry , the @xmath1 invariance of @xmath102 need not lead to the @xmath2 invariance of @xmath101 ( and thus to that of @xmath103 , as we have seen on the example of the scarf ii potential ) , so the whole susy construction can break down in this case .",
    "in general , solvable @xmath1 symmetric potentials may have a richer spectrum than their hermitian counterparts . _ a priori _ , this feature may have non - trivial implications in the susy constructions .",
    "we investigated the @xmath1 symmetric version of the scarf ii potential in the role of a `` bosonic '' potential and described in detail a construction of its  fermionic \" susy partners .",
    "our first finding was based on the familiar knowledge that our potential possesses two sets of normalizable eigenfunctions distinguished by their quasi - parity quantum number @xmath0 . on this basis",
    "we arrived at our first important observation that one can introduce _ two different _ superpotential functions which lead to _ two different _ susy partners of the original potential .",
    "the formal application of the standard rules of supersymmetric quantum mechanics requires the vanishing ground - state energy of the  bosonic \" potential , so a relative energy shift of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 sectors is needed to correlate the energy scales .",
    "( this corresponds to switching to the hamiltonians @xmath57 and @xmath61 instead of @xmath104 and @xmath105 . ) with this shift the  bosonic \" potential can be made independent of the quasi - parity quantum number @xmath14 .",
    "we found that the two partner potentials are scarf ii potentials with the parameters @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "their energy spectrum contains one less normalizable state than the  bosonic \" potential , and the missing level carries the same quasi - parity quantum number as the `` fermionic '' hamiltonian @xmath61 .",
    "this is similar to the structures found within the standard susyqm , although the related concept of the shape invariance must be modified slightly .",
    "still , the situation becomes perceivably different for the unbroken and for the spontaneously broken @xmath16 symmetry . in the former case , both @xmath20 and @xmath21 and",
    "the energy eigenvalues are real . in this case both",
    " fermionic \" partner potentials exhibit @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "in contrast , for spontaneously broken @xmath2 symmetry ( i.e. when @xmath20 is imaginary , @xmath21 is real and the energy eigenvalues form complex conjugate pairs ) the @xmath2 symmetry of the  fermionic \" partner potentials may become broken _ manifestly_. our second important observation is that the isospectrality of the potentials ( with the exception of the  bosonic \" @xmath108 states ) still holds in this latter case , too .    additionally , we considered an alternative susy construction for @xmath2 symmetric potentials in the spirit of @xcite where the susy algebra has been realized by susy charge operators containing the antilinear operator @xmath92 in an explicit form .",
    "our considerations were not restricted to a particular potential , rather their validity was universal .",
