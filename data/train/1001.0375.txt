    "according to mermin and wagner  @xcite there is no ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order in the one- and two - dimensional isotropic heisenberg models with interactions of finite range at nonzero temperature .",
    "this statement is proven due to bogoliubov s inequality in the general case . here",
    "we construct excitations that cause a destruction of a long - range nematic or mixed ferromagnetic - nematic order .",
    "this is an extension of the results of belavin and polyakov @xcite .",
    "we model a planar magnet by a square atomic lattice with the same spin  @xmath1 at each site .",
    "we describe this two - dimensional spin system by a generalized heisenberg hamiltonian , taking into account high powers of the exchange interaction @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a vector of spin operators at site @xmath4 . by a mean field approximation",
    "we obtain a classical long - range equation from the quantum heisenberg one .",
    "an equation for a mean field ( the field of magnetization and multipole moments ) is a hamiltonian equation on a coadjoint orbit of lie group . at the same time , this is a generalization of the well - known landau - lifshitz equation for a magnetization field . in this context",
    "we obtain effective hamiltonians for the magnetic system in question . using khlerian structure of coadjoint orbits",
    ", we construct effective hamiltonians such that their minimums are proportional to topological charges of excitations . in addition",
    ", we produce these mean field configurations that give minimums to the hamiltonians .",
    "as mentioned above , we represent the spin system by a planar atomic lattice with the same spin @xmath1 at all sites . we assign three spin operators @xmath5 to each atom @xmath4 ; the operators obey the standard commutation relations @xmath6",
    "= i\\varepsilon_{abc } \\hat{s}^c_n \\delta_{nm},\\ ] ] where @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 run over the values @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "we are interested in so called high spins @xmath12 . in this case",
    ", we can describe the system by the following _ bilinear - biquadratic hamiltonian _",
    "@xmath13 here @xmath14 runs over the nearest - neighbour sites , @xmath4 runs over all sites of the lattice , constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote exchange integrals . in the case of spin @xmath17 ,",
    "the above hamiltonian can include also the bicubic exchange , namely @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the corresponding exchange integral .",
    "one can easily write a generalized heisenberg hamiltonian for the system of an arbitrary spin @xmath1 or greater than @xmath1 .",
    "this hamiltonian contains all powers of the exchange interaction up to @xmath20 .",
    "it can be reduced to a bilinear form if one takes the @xmath0-dimensional space of irreducible representation of the group su(2 ) .",
    "the spin operators @xmath21 over this space generate a complete associative matrix algebra , which has a sufficient number of operators to reduce the corresponding hamiltonian to a bilinear form .",
    "for example , in the case of spin @xmath22 the appropriate space of representation is 3-dimensional , and we choose a canonical basis in the form : @xmath23 .",
    "the spin operators @xmath21 generate the algebra @xmath24 . in order to form a basis in the algebra we take the tensor operators of weight  2 @xmath25 in addition to the spin operators .",
    "the introduced operators are called _",
    "quadrupole operators_.    in the case of spin @xmath26 the appropriate space of representation is 4-dimensional , and @xmath27 of @xmath21 by the tensor operators of weights 2 and 3 , defining them by the following formulas : @xmath28 @xmath29 we call the tensor operators of weight 3 _ sextupole operators_. in what follows we denote all tensor operators over the chosen space of representation by @xmath30 .    in terms of representation operators a generalized heisenberg hamiltonian",
    "gets a bilinear form . for the hamiltonians considered above we have : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the overall number of sites in the lattice",
    ", the obtained bilinear hamiltonians are su(2)-invariant , because they are constructed from representation operators of the group su(2 ) .      here",
    "a mean field is a field of expectation values for the operators @xmath33 calculated after spontaneous breaking of symmetry .",
    "the breaking of symmetry is performed by switching on an external magnetic field , which specifies an order in the system ; then the external field vanishes . such kind of averages is also called _ quasiaverages _ @xcite .",
    "we denote a mean field averaging by @xmath34 , and components of the mean field by @xmath35 .",
    "a mean field approximation of the bilinear - biquadratic hamiltonian has the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a number of the nearest - neighbour sites .",
    "evidently , a mean field hamiltonian remains @xmath38-invariant .",
    "then by an action of the group @xmath38 it can be reduced to a diagonal form .",
    "of course , this reduction is possible only in the case of thermodynamical equilibrium and an infinite lattice , when the mean field becomes constant and the dependance on site @xmath4 can be omitted . moreover , almost all components of the mean field vanish , except the components corresponding to diagonal operators of @xmath30 . for the bilinear - biquadratic hamiltonian",
    "a diagonal form is the following : @xmath39 the remaining components are suitable to serve as _",
    "order parameters_. the component @xmath40 describes a normalized _ magnetization _ ( a ratio of the @xmath37-projection of magnetic moment to a saturation magnetization ) .",
    "the components @xmath41 and @xmath42 are normalized _ projections of quadrupole _ and _ sextupole moments _ , respectively .",
    "possible values of order parameters can be obtained from the _ self - consistent equations _",
    "@xmath43 for all diagonal operators @xmath44 . here",
    "we use the density matrix with the one - site hamiltonian @xmath45 .",
    "note , that for the standard heisenberg hamiltonian , when only the spin operators are considered , a self - consistent equation turns into the well - known weiss equation .    in the case of bilinear - biquadratic hamiltonian",
    ", an analysis of self - consistent equations gives the following .",
    "we adduce probable values of order parameters in the limit @xmath46 as @xmath47 : 1 )  @xmath48 ; 2 )  @xmath49 ; 3 )  @xmath50 ; 4 )  @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "two of the solutions correspond to states with the ferromagnetic order , because they have a nonzero magnetization  @xmath40 .",
    "the other two solutions correspond to states with the quadrupole order ( so called nematic states ) , which are states with zero magnetization . solutions 2 ) and 4 ) are unstable and called partly ordered .",
    "if @xmath16 becomes negative , only solution 1 ) remains .",
    "these results accord with the results of @xcite and with the phase diagram of ordered states in a one - dimensional spin system from @xcite .    in what follows we consider an su(3)-invariant system with the bilinear - biquadratic hamiltonian .",
    "the su(3)-invariance is reached by assigning @xmath53 ; this is the boundary line between the ferromagnetic and the nematic regions ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it means the system can appear in the both states . in the case of hamiltonian @xmath54 , the maximal su(4)-invariance is reached as @xmath55 , that is located within the ferromagnetic region .",
    "now we apply the mean field averaging to the quantum heisenberg equation @xmath56.\\ ] ] the averaging is performed with the assumption of zero correlations between fluctuations of @xmath30 at distinct sites : @xmath57 . then we take a large - scale limit and obtain the landau - lifshitz like equation @xmath58 where @xmath59 are structure constants of the lie algebra of @xmath30 with the commutation relations @xmath60=ic_{abc}\\hat{p}^c_n \\delta_{nm}$ ] .",
    "equation is an equation of motion for the mean field @xmath61 over the plain @xmath62 that replaces the lattice .    in the case of standard",
    "heisenberg hamiltonian coincides with the landau - lifshitz equation for an isotropic magnet .",
    "therefore , in the general case we call a _ generalized landau - lifshitz equation _ for the vector field @xmath63 . the vector field has 8 components if one exploits the bilinear - biquadratic hamiltonian , and 15 components for the hamiltonian with the bicubic exchange .",
    "the generalized landau - lifshitz equation can be interpreted as a _",
    "hamiltonian equation on a coadjoint orbit of lie group_. in the case of spin @xmath64 we deal with the group @xmath65 , in the case of an arbitrary spin @xmath1 the group is @xmath66 .",
    "note , that the matrices @xmath67 serve as a basis in the corresponding lie algebra @xmath68 , and components of the mean field @xmath63 serve as coordinates in the dual space to @xmath68 .",
    "we start with brief description of the groups su(3 ) and su(4 ) . for more material see , in particular , @xcite .",
    "the group su(3 ) has two types of orbits : the generic @xmath69 of dimension  6 , and the degenerate @xmath70 of dimension 4 .",
    "each orbit of su(3 ) is defined by two numbers @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which are values of the coordinates @xmath40 and @xmath41 at an initial point ( a point in the positive weyl chamber ) .",
    "simultaneously , these numbers are limiting values of the mean field components @xmath40 and @xmath41 at zero temperature .",
    "for a degenerate orbit one has to assign @xmath73 , or @xmath74 .",
    "evidently the degenerate orbits with @xmath73 are domains of mean field configurations that realize nematic states .",
    "ferromagnetic states are realized on all other orbits of su(3 ) .",
    "the group su(4 ) has four types of orbits : the generic @xmath75 of dimension @xmath76 , the degenerate @xmath77 of dimension 10 , the degenerate @xmath78 of dimension 8 , and the maximal degenerate @xmath79 of dimension 6 .",
    "each orbit is defined by numbers @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath80 , which are limiting values of the mean field components @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "almost all orbits are domains of ferromagnetic mean field configurations .",
    "nematic states are realized on the degenerate orbits of dimension 8 as @xmath81 and @xmath72 is arbitrary .",
    "so it is probable to reveal a nematic state even in the ferromagnetic region of the phase diagram  @xcite .    as shown above , _ limiting values of diagonal components of a mean field _ serve as order parameters .",
    "simultaneously , they _ define a coadjoint orbit _ where the corresponding mean filed configuration lives .",
    "each orbit possesses a hamiltonian system with an equation of motion and a group - invariant hamiltonian . for a degenerate orbit of su(3 )",
    "the equation is @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes a dimensional constant .",
    "the values @xmath71 , @xmath72 of order parameters ( a magnetization and a projection of quadrupole moment ) define an orbit via the following equations , which we call constraints : @xmath84 here @xmath85 is a symmetric tensor .",
    "the corresponding su(3)-invariant hamiltonian is the following @xmath86 where the dimensional constant @xmath87 has a meaning of exchange integral .",
    "obviously , equations and coincide .",
    "it is easy to show , that coincides with the equation of motion on a maximal degenerate orbit .",
    "recall , that is obtained when correlations between fluctuations of @xmath30 are neglected .",
    "presumably , equations of motion on other orbits are derived from via the mean field averaging with more complicate correlation rules .    a generic orbit of su(3 )",
    "is determined by the following equations : @xmath88 the su(3)-invariant hamiltonian on this orbit has the form @xmath89where @xmath90 is a quadratic form in @xmath63 : @xmath91 . for more details",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian systems on coadjoint orbits of su(3 ) serve as _ classical effective models _ for the spin system of @xmath92 with biquadratic exchange .",
    "evidently , these models describe large - scale ( or slow ) fluctuations of the mean field . in this paper",
    "we suppose that the order parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 are fixed numbers .",
    "but generally speaking , they depend on a temperature  @xmath93 and the interaction constant  @xmath15 .",
    "taking into account these dependencies , one can consider small - scale ( or quick ) fluctuations of the mean field .",
    "each coadjoint orbit of a semisimple lie group is a homogeneous space that admits a khlerian structure .",
    "thus one can introduce a complex parameterization of an orbit .",
    "for this purpose we use a _ generalized stereographic projection _ ( for more details see @xcite ) . in the case of group su(3 ) , the projection is represented by the following formulas : @xmath94    @xmath95 the coordinates @xmath96 ( bruhat coordinates according to @xcite ) parameterize a generic orbit of @xmath65 . in the case of a degenerate orbit , one has to assign @xmath73 and @xmath97 , or @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    in terms of @xmath100 the effective hamiltonians and have the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a complex coordinate on the plane obtained from the atomic lattice after a large - scale limiting process ( see section  [ s : mfa ] ) .",
    "the tensor @xmath103 is non - degenerate and positively defined , thus it can serve as a metrics on an orbit .",
    "its components @xmath104 come from for a degenerate orbit , and from for a generic one . in terms of the auxiliary vector fields @xmath105 and @xmath106 we have @xmath107 note , that in terms of @xmath100 the tensor @xmath103 does not depend on a particular orbit .",
    "being a khlerian manifold an orbit of su(3 ) possesses a khlerian potential . for this purpose",
    "we use a potential @xmath108 of the kirillov - kostant - suoriau form : @xmath109 a topological structure of the orbit is characterized by the second cohomology group @xmath110 of dimension 2 .",
    "that is why there exist two basis 2-forms , for example generated by the potentials @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "each of them defines a topological charge @xmath113    on a degenerate orbit only one potential is governing , and only one topological charge exists .",
    "then the expressions for @xmath114 and @xmath115 differ only in a sign .",
    "evidently , @xmath116 is realized if the equality holds , that takes place if @xmath117 are holomorphic or antiholomorphic functions_. here we use an idea of belavin and polyakov @xcite .    for a generic orbit",
    "we define a topological charge by @xmath118 . in order to extend inequality to generic orbits with the topological charge @xmath119",
    ", we construct an effective hamiltonian by the following formula : @xmath120 in terms of @xmath100 it is reduced to the form with the metrics @xmath121 then we get @xmath122 and _ a minimum of @xmath123 is realized if the equality holds , that takes place if @xmath117 are holomorphic or antiholomorphic functions_.",
    "now we construct a particular class of topological excitations that give minimums to the effective hamiltonians @xmath124 , and @xmath123 defined by .",
    "we describe these excitations by holomorphic functions @xmath125 .",
    "each set @xmath126 @xmath127 , @xmath128 represents a mean field configuration of the system in question .",
    "first , we consider a degenerate orbit of  @xmath65 with @xmath73 , @xmath129 , where a nematic state is realized . in order to satisfy the limiting conditions : @xmath130 , @xmath131 , the functions @xmath125 have to vanish as @xmath132 .",
    "let @xmath133 be a large - scale excitation in the magnet in question .",
    "the corresponding mean field configuration is obtained by substitution of into .",
    "a behavior of the components @xmath40 and @xmath41 is represented on the fig.1 . as @xmath132",
    "the values of @xmath40 , @xmath41 tend to @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "1 . profiles of the mean field components @xmath40 , @xmath41 in the case of configuration .",
    "suppose @xmath134 . by shifting of the coordinate @xmath37",
    "one can easily reduce to the configuration @xmath135 and calculate its topological charge : @xmath136 in the case of @xmath137 the topological charge equals 2 .",
    "it can be interpreted as follows .",
    "each pole of a mean field configuration represents a kind of belavin - plyakov soliton .",
    "each soliton gives a unit topological charge .",
    "thus , two distinct solitons have the topological charge 2 .",
    "no continuous deformation take a configuration of topological charge 2 to a configuration of topological charge 1 .",
    "if we allow noncontinuous deformation , then two solitons can meet at any point and join into one , at the same time an energy is released . from , it follows that the released energy equals @xmath138 per one pole .",
    "note , that the energy of configuration does not depend on parameters of solitons : @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "it means that the excitation can grow ( when @xmath143 and @xmath144 grow ) preserving an energy .",
    "such growth immediately leads to destruction of an order in the system .",
    "one can construct a configuration with more than two solitons : @xmath145 here @xmath139 , @xmath141 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 are fixed complex numbers . if all values @xmath146 and @xmath147 are distinct , a topological charge equals @xmath148 . when a pole of the function @xmath149 coincides with a pole of @xmath150 , the topological charge decreases by 1 . but a coincidence of two poles of the same function ( for example @xmath149 ) does not lead to a decrease of the topological charge .",
    "it is easy to see , that the minimal energy of configuration equals @xmath151 .",
    "now we consider a generic orbit , where a ferromagnetic state is realized .",
    "suppose @xmath152 and @xmath129 . in this case , we describe a mean field in the magnet by the effective hamiltonian @xmath123 , defined by .",
    "let @xmath153 be a large - scale excitation of the mean field .",
    "a calculation of topological charges gives : 1 ) @xmath154 , @xmath155 , if @xmath156 or @xmath157 , 2 ) @xmath158 , @xmath155 , if @xmath159 , 3 ) @xmath158 , @xmath160 , if @xmath161 or @xmath162 .",
    "each generalized heisenberg hamiltonian with high powers of the exchange interaction can be reduced to a bilinear form . by a mean field averaging we obtain a classical system from the original quantum one .",
    "an averaging of the heisenberg equation gives a landau - lifshitz like equation for a mean field . using lie group apparatus ,",
    "we construct effective hamiltonians for the classical system with su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "one of them @xmath163 is an su(3)-analogue of the hamiltonian commonly used in theory of magnetism .",
    "in addition , we propose another one @xmath123 , which is biquadratic in the mean field .",
    "further , we construct examples of topological excitations that give minimums to the hamiltonians . such excitations can change their shapes and grow preserving an energy . this is a probable scenario for the destruction of an ordered state in a 2d magnet at nonzero temperature , that agrees with the mermin - wagner theorem .",
