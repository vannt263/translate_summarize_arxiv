    "in the @xmath5 limit the behaviour of quantum systems can be expressed in terms of the classical phase space trajectories .",
    "for one dimensional scalar problems the wkb method @xcite yields semi - classical wavefunctions and energy levels , an approach that can be generalized to both integrable multi - dimensional systems ( ekb torus quantization @xcite ) , as well as to systems with multi - component wave functions@xcite . in the latter case , however , the multi - component wavefunction matching inherent in the wkb approach rapidly becomes prohibitively cumbersome as the number of components increases .",
    "the gutzwiller trace formula circumvents this matching problem by giving a direct expression for the semi - classical density of states .",
    "it is , furthermore , valid for systems with a non - integrable ( i.e. , chaotic ) classical limit .",
    "while generalizations of the trace formula for the multi - component case have been presented for specific matrix hamiltonians such as the relativistic dirac hamiltonian@xcite and the dirac - weyl hamiltonian of graphene@xcite , a general multi - component version of the trace formula has not been considered . in the solid state theory context , however , a semi - classical method applicable to _ arbitrary matrix hamiltonians _ would be extremely useful .",
    "this is so for two reasons .",
    "firstly , in many systems , for instance few layer graphenes , topological insulators , and semiconductors , one encounters multi - band effective hamiltonians and hence multicomponent wavefunctions .",
    "secondly , and perhaps most importantly , in the emerging class of low dimensional materials one very often encounters structural deformations occurring on length scales far in excess of the lattice constant .",
    "such deformations are very difficult to treat fully quantum mechanically ( due to the huge unit cell sizes involved ) while at the same time presenting a natural case for a semi - classical treatment ( due to the slowly varying spatial deformation ) .",
    "examples include flexural ripples in graphene@xcite , rotational stacking faults in few layer graphene systems@xcite , the recently discovered partial dislocation networks in few layer graphenes@xcite , and graphene nanostructures for which interesting semi - classical work already exists@xcite .",
    "a general semi - classical approach for treating such systems thus has the potential of providing a very useful investigative tool .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is therefore twofold : ( i ) to generalize the gutzwiller trace formula to the case of arbitrary matrix - valued hamiltonians and ( ii ) to demonstrate that the semi - classical approach yields an _ accurate and tractable _ scheme for the treatment of deformations in graphene based systems . to that end",
    ", we will first focus on fundamental theory and some simple applications , and in the final part of the paper consider application of the theory to a realistically complex example of a deformation in bilayer graphene , a one dimensional strain moir .",
    "let us briefly outline the differences between the matrix - valued case and the scalar case within a semi - classical treatment",
    ". at @xmath6 a scalar schrdinger equation reduces to the hamilton - jacobi equation of classical mechanics . for a @xmath0 hamiltonian ,",
    "however , there are two important differences in the @xmath6 classical structures .",
    "firstly , we obtain @xmath2 hamilton - jacobi equations , some of which may be identical .",
    "this situation arises , for instance , in the @xmath7 limit of the dirac equation@xcite , where each of the two hamilton - jacobi equations ( for particles and antiparticles ) is twice degenerate - in the limit @xmath7 there is no spin and hence one obtains two pairs of degenerate equations . as for the case of ordinary perturbation theory , such degenerate cases require a special treatment .",
    "secondly , the hamiltonian phase space is found to be endowed with a classical berry curvature arising from anholonomy in the transport of the eigenvectors @xmath8 of @xmath3 around the classical orbits .",
    "in contrast to the scalar case , for multi - band quantum hamiltonians the semi - classical particle types have `` internal structure '' ( pseudospin structure in the case of graphene , for example ) and it is this that is encoded in the classical eigenvectors of @xmath9 ; the classical berry curvature is thus a direct consequence of the internal degrees of freedom of the underlying quantum system .    at @xmath10",
    "we obtain an equation for the amplitude that is transported along the classical orbits described by the hamilton - jacobi equations of motion .",
    "in contrast to the scalar case , for a matrix hamiltonian this amplitude acquires an addition phase resulting from the @xmath6 berry curvature which , for non - degenerate systems , consists of ( i ) a geometric phase and ( ii ) a dynamical phase acquired by transport of the classical particle through this berry curvature .",
    "the geometric part of this phase depends only on individual hamilton - jacobi orbits , while the dynamical phase couples all the @xmath2 hamilton - jacobi systems . for degenerate systems one finds the non - abelian analogue of the berry curvature and phase .",
    "the existence of a dynamical phase related to the berry curvature ( in addition to the usual geometric phase ) is somewhat unusual , and reflects the fact that we have a transport equation for the amplitude function and not the semi - classical vectors @xmath8 .",
    "our approach differs from that taken by carmier and ullmo@xcite in their semi - classical study of graphene and 2-band bilayer graphene in that their description begins with the energy dependent greens function , which then enforces a complex matching procedure for the boundary condition of this function ; as in the case of the wkb method , this becomes prohibitively cumbersome for a general matrix valued hamiltonian .",
    "following bolte and keppeler@xcite we implement the boundary conditions for the greens functions at the level of the time dependent greens functions , which allows an elegant solution that circumvents the boundary matching problem .",
    "the procedure leading from an arbitrary matrix valued hamiltonian to the density of states is presented as an explicit set of steps , and we apply it to a number of cases where the exact solution is known : the landau spectra of graphene , a 4-band model of bilayer graphene , and silicene .",
    "as one would expect , the agreement between the exact and the semi - classical results becomes considerably degraded at low energies , and in particular for bilayer graphene the zero mode found in the exact solution is not captured within the semi - classical approximation ( and is , of course , also not captured in the 2-band approximation to this problem@xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore by no means obvious that a semi - classical approach is suitable for graphene based systems with slowly spatial deformations , as one is always interested in the low energy behaviour .",
    "to explore this situation more closely we consider a realistic example of such a deformation : a one dimensional strain moir in bilayer graphene , which serves as an instructive analogue of the graphene twist bilayer@xcite , two mutually rotated layers of graphene .",
    "the twist bilayer displays extraordinarily rich electronic structure in small angle limit @xcite ( i.e. , as the moir length becomes large ) , and in particular a strong electron localization on the aa stacked regions of the lattice .",
    "we present an analytical semi - classical analysis of the strain moir , finding that : ( i ) at the dirac point the action is orders of magnitude larger than @xmath11 when the moir length becomes large compared to the lattice constant - thus validating the semi - classical approach - and ( ii ) that the electron localization is driven by the existence of a _ semi - classical potential well _ centered at the aa spots , that arises from the stacking potential in the quantum hamiltonian . we should stress that this `` potential well '' picture , which provides a very natural description of charge localization , is fundamentally semi - classical : no such `` potential well '' could localize quantum mechanically due to the klien paradox which prevents localization of electrons in graphene by a scalar potential .",
    "we furthermore find an analytical form for the semi - classical density of states arising from electrons trapped in this potential well , which we show to be in almost perfect agreement with exact quantum mechanical calculations .",
    "this demonstrates both that the semi - classical approach provides a valid tool for investigating slow deformations in few layer systems , as well as the insight it can bring into the physics of these rather complex systems .",
    "it should be stressed that treating such a system on the basis of either the standard wkb approach ( in principle possible as we have an effective one - dimensional system ) , or that of ref .",
    ", could not be contemplated due to the extraordinarily complexity of the matching procedure that would be involved .",
    "we consider schrdinger s equation for the greens function @xmath12 with a _ matrix - valued _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath13    @xmath14    and the boundary condition    @xmath15    we assume that @xmath13 is analytic in @xmath16 , or more precisely that for all smooth test functions @xmath17 the matrix @xmath18 is analytical in @xmath19 .",
    "we further assume that the hamiltonian may be decomposed as @xmath20 , in which @xmath21 is a matrix containing only derivatives ( such as momentum operators ) and @xmath22 contains only coordinate functions such as potentials .",
    "this restriction is easily lifted without qualitatively changing what follows , however it covers most physical situations and simplifies the analysis so we retain it .",
    "finally , we introduce the following convention : the _ primed _ coordinates are _ initial _ coordinates with the _ non - primed _ ones the _ final _ coordinates on a classical trajectory .",

    "this procedure leads to the _ zero eigenvalue condition _    @xmath27    ( we may drop the sum and integral in eq .   as the equation is linear . )",
    "there are evidently @xmath2 solutions to this equation which occur when the @xmath28 are equal to the @xmath2 orthonormal eigenvectors of @xmath29 . denoting the corresponding eigenvalue by @xmath30",
    ", we find that the zero eigenvalue equation implies the existence of @xmath2 hamilton - jacobi equations    @xmath31    from which we then immediately identify for system @xmath32 the following objects : @xmath30 is a classical scalar hamiltonian , the real scalar function @xmath33 a classical action , and @xmath34 the corresponding canonical momentum .",
    "thus a general @xmath0 quantum hamiltonian leads to @xmath2 separate classical systems at order @xmath6 .",
    "the full classical information is contained in the @xmath2 hamilton - jacobi equations ( [ hjeq ] ) and the @xmath2 vectors @xmath28 .    the situation becomes more complicated if the matrix @xmath35 has degenerate eigenvalues . in this circumstance recourse to degenerate perturbation theory may be circumvented following the scheme of bolte and keppeler , in which the @xmath36 orthogonalized eigenvectors corresponding to the degenerate eigenfunction @xmath30 are combined into an @xmath37 `` full degenerate eigenvector '' that evidently satisfies @xmath38 . with the initial conditions",
    "@xmath39    the boundary condition of the green s function equation is satisfied and the calculations thereafter proceed in a formally identical way for both the degenerate and non - degenerate cases , with the difference of course that the rank of the various objects in the theory differs between the two cases .",
