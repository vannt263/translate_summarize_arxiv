    "@xcite provides an introduction into the competing theories for the nature of the @xmath0 boo stars , briefly summarized here .",
    "the first hypothesis is that @xmath0  boo stars are young main sequence stars which are still surrounded by a shell or disk of gas and dust @xcite .",
    "the heavy , refractory elements are locked within the surrounding dust grains .",
    "the volatile elements remain in the gas and accrete onto the star , while the dust grains are blown away by the stellar radiation pressure taking the heavy elements with them , requiring the presence of circumstellar dust .",
    "all four of the known @xmath0 boo stars within 40 pc have detected infrared excesses @xcite indicative of circumstellar dust .",
    "a continual accretion of the light gases at a rate of @xmath15 @xcite is needed .",
    "once the accretion stops , the observed metal deficiencies fade within a million years .",
    "it is unclear if the surrounding disks contain enough light element gases to sustain the needed accretion rate over the main sequence lifetime of the star .    in this model",
    ", @xmath0 boo stars would be relatively young ( tens to hundreds of myr ) with solar - metallicity but with metal - deficient photospheres .",
    "@xcite obtained spectra of 60 herbig ae and pre - main sequence a - stars , which , in this scenario , would be expected to contain a higher fraction of @xmath0  boo stars than the general field , but found only one @xmath0 boo star and one marginal @xmath0 boo star , a rate comparable to the field star rate .",
    "a variation of this hypothesis places the @xmath0  boo stars at the end of their main sequence lifetimes , and the shell is the result of mass loss .",
    "after @xmath16 years of mass loss , diffusion in the atmosphere produces underabundances of the heavier elements @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear if this mechanism can produce the strong underabundances of heavy elements that is observed in the @xmath0 boo stars . in this hypothesis , @xmath0 boo stars would be relatively old ( a few gyr ) . at these ages",
    ", the @xmath0 boo stars may be intrinsically more metal - poor than comparable a - stars which are younger .",
    "interestingly , @xcite concluded that the field @xmath0 boo stars are located relatively homogeneously throughout their main sequence evolution . based upon comparison to solar - metallicity isochrones",
    ", they find a uniform distribution of ages for @xmath0 boo stars between 10 myr to 500 myr .",
    "this is followed by a rise in the number of @xmath0 boo stars at an age of 0.6 - 1 gyr , at which point the fraction of @xmath0 boo stars relative to normal a - stars is higher than at younger ages .",
    "an alternative hypothesis is that @xmath0  boo stars are binary stars with both stars being of similar spectral type .",
    "the composite spectrum produces an apparent under - abundance of heavy elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a complementary proposal is that @xmath0  boo stars are actually contact binary stars @xcite",
    ". the composite colors of the star would look normal , but the spectral abundances would appear `` metal - poor '' @xcite .",
    "nearly all of the work on @xmath0  boo stars has involved detailed color and/or spectral analysis of the stars to determine effective temperatures , surface gravities , and elemental abundances .",
    "determinations of basic stellar parameters , such as the stellar radii and masses , have been made indirectly from photometric fitting and comparison to evolutionary models .",
    "optical interferometry , which is capable of resolving the stellar disk can add crucial and independent information to the debate on @xmath0  boo stars .",
    "we have made the first direct measurements of the angular diameter of the prototype for the class , @xmath0  botis ( hd 125162 , a3 v kb9.5mb9.5 ; * ? ? ?",

    "the primary result of this paper is the measurement of the apparent angular diameter for @xmath0  boo . in the following sections , we discuss the angular diameter determination and the associated linear radius of @xmath0  boo .",
    "we then relate these measurements to the effective temperature and mass , comparing @xmath0  boo to other a - stars .",
    "we have modelled the observed mean visibilities as listed in table [ meanv2-tab ] with a uniform disk of angular size @xmath26 of the form : @xmath27 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the first order bessel function , @xmath29 is the projected baseline length , @xmath0 is the wavelength of the observations , and @xmath30 is the apparent uniform disk angular diameter .",
