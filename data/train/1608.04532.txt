    "a polycrystalline sample of rbfe@xmath3as@xmath3 was synthesized in two steps.@xcite first , rbas and fe@xmath3as precursors were prepared from stoichiometric amounts of rubidium , arsenic and iron .",
    "the components were mixed and heated in evacuated and sealed silica tubes at 350 c and at 800 c , respectively .",
    "then , the obtained rbas and fe@xmath3as were mixed together in a molar ratio 1:1 , pressed into pellets and placed in an alumina crucible and sealed in an evacuated silica ampoule .",
    "the sample was annealed at 650 c for three days , ground and annealed for another three days at the same temperature .",
    "it should be emphasized that the annealing temperature and time are crucial parameters .",
    "the annealing at higher temperature or extended annealing time causes decomposition of the compound .",
    "the phase purity was checked by x - ray powder diffraction .",
    "the diffraction lines ( shown in fig.[xrd ] ) can be indexed with a tetragonal thcr@xmath3si@xmath3 type unit cell with lattice parameters @xmath58  and @xmath59  , in good agreement with those reported in ref .. the ac - susceptibility measurements were performed on heating with an ac field of 10 oe at 1111 hz . the real component ( fig.[chiac ] ) reveals the onset of diamagnetism and of bulk superconductivity below @xmath60 k.@xcite",
    "first - principles dft calculations of the electronic structure were performed using the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave method as implemented in the elk package  @xcite . for the exchange - correlation functional we used the generalized gradient approximation of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof  @xcite .",
    "the atomic positions used in the calculation are those obtained from room temperature x - ray diffraction . in order to calculate the electric field gradient ( efg ) tensor components @xmath61 we solved the poisson equation for the charge distribution to determine the electrostatic potential @xmath62 and derived @xmath61 from @xmath63 where @xmath64 runs over the nuclei at @xmath65 .",
    "since the efg tensor is extremely sensitive to the charge distribution a well converged basis set is needed to grant the convergence with respect to the efg tensor components .",
    "we used muffin tin radii of 2.6 @xmath66 for rb and 2.4 @xmath66 for fe and as , with @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the smallest muffin tin ( mt ) radius inside the mt spheres and @xmath69 the magnitude of the reciprocal space vectors .",
    "we choose 9 for the cut off of the angular momentum quantum number in the lattice harmonics expansion inside the mts .",
    "reciprocal space was sampled with the monkhorst - pack  @xcite scheme on a @xmath70 grid .",
    "a smearing of 270 mev was used within the methfessel - paxton scheme  @xcite and convergence of the efg components with respect to all these parameters has been carefully checked .",
    "once the efg tensor components are known the nqr frequency at @xmath0as and @xmath1rb can be calculated from eq . 1 in the main article . the obtained values , ( @xmath71)@xmath72 14.12 mhz and ( @xmath73)@xmath72 6.7 mhz are in good agreement with the experimental values ( @xmath71)@xmath7414.6 mhz and ( @xmath73)@xmath74 6.2 mhz and the discrepancy represents an estimate of the accuracy of the dft calculation which",
    "is known to not properly account for the electronic correlations .",
    "@xmath0as nqr and @xmath1rb nmr spectra were derived by recording the integral of the echo signal after a @xmath75 pulse sequence as a function of the irradiation frequency . at a few temperatures",
    "the @xmath0as nqr spectra was also obtained by merging the fourier transforms of half of the echo recorded at different frequencies but no relevant additional features appeared in the spectra .",
    "we point out that any tiny amount of spurious phases as feas and fe@xmath3as ( not detected in x - ray diffraction ) will not affect the @xmath0as nqr spectra since these materials are magnetically ordered and the internal field shifts the resonance frequency to much higher values .",
    "also in feas@xmath3 the @xmath0as nqr line is in a completely different frequency range.@xcite    the narrow @xmath13rb nqr spectra were obtained from the fourier transform of half of the echo signal obtained after the same echo pulse sequence . @xmath1rb",
    "nmr powder spectrum for the central @xmath76 transition is displayed in fig.[rbnmr ] .",
    "the spectrum is fully compatible with the @xmath1rb quadrupole frequency determined from the nqr spectra .",
    "@xmath0as spin - spin relaxation rate @xmath40 was derived in nqr by recording the decay of the echo amplitude @xmath77 after a @xmath75 pulse sequence .",
    "the decay could be fit in general with @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "a value of @xmath80 lower than 2 and the slight temperature dependence of @xmath81 ( fig.[figt2 ] ) should be associated with redfield contribution to the relaxation @xmath82 .",
    "then one can write @xmath83 , with @xmath40 the spin - spin relaxation rate . in case of an anysotropic spin - lattice relaxation rate ,",
    "et al_. @xcite calculated a general expression for @xmath84 . in case of a nuclear spin @xmath16 , with the @xmath85 axes of the efg along the @xmath86 axes one should have : @xmath87 where the symbols @xmath88 and @xmath89 refers to the external field orientation with respect to the crystallographic @xmath86 axis .",
    "in particular , @xmath90 corresponds to @xmath0as nqr @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath91 was determined by assuming an anisotropy in @xmath14 equal to the one found in electron - doped bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "once the data have been corrected by redfield contribution one finds that @xmath0as @xmath40 is temperature independent ( fig.[figt2 ] ) , with @xmath92 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath93 from 2 , as it is expected in the case of nuclear dipolar interaction in a dense system @xcite is likely a consequence of the partial irradiation of the nqr spectrum .",
    "taking into account of @xmath94 corrections we have measured the @xmath95-dependence of @xmath0as nqr spectrum amplitude below 50 k and did not observe any significant change .",
    "@xmath1rb nmr @xmath14 was measured in a @xmath96 tesla magnetic field by irradiating just the high frequency shoulder of the powder spectrum of the central line shown in fig.[rbnmr ] , corresponding to grains with the @xmath86-axes perpendicular to @xmath97 .",
    "the recovery of @xmath1rb nmr central line magnetization after a saturation recovery pulse sequence was fit according to @xmath98 the recovery is shown in fig.[t1rbnmr ] and one observes , similarly to what one finds in @xmath0as nqr , two components appearing at low temperature .",
    "the long component were measured just in nmr since in nqr the very long @xmath1rb relaxations and the much lower signal intensity make the measurements quite demanding .",
    "the fast component , the only one present at @xmath99 k , was measured in nqr irradiating either @xmath1rb @xmath100 transition or @xmath2rb @xmath101 .",
    "the recovery of nuclear magnetization was fit according to the recovery laws expected for a magnetic relaxation mechanism @xcite @xmath102 for @xmath1rb and      for @xmath2rb .",
    "the ratio between the @xmath14 of the two nuclei for the fast relaxing component was measured at a few selected temperatures between 4 and 25 k and @xmath104 ( fig.[t1rbnqr ] ) , in good agreement with the ratio between the square of the gyromagnetic ratios of the two nuclei @xmath43 , confirming the adequacy of the recovery laws we have used to estimate @xmath14 and the fact that the relaxation is driven by electron spin fluctuations .",
    "notice that if the relaxation was driven by efg fluctuations @xmath14 should scale with the square of the nuclear electric quadrupole moment and one should have @xmath105 a value about 50 times smaller than the experimental one .",
    "we have measured the frequency dependence of @xmath0as @xmath14 across the nqr spectrum by decreasing the intensity of the radiofrequency field so that we irradiated a width of about 30 khz in the spectrum .",
    "we found that the recovery laws did not change significantly across the spectrum ( fig.[t1vsfreq ] ) .",
    "namely , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 show a negligible frequency dependence .",
    "it should be mentioned that @xmath32 and @xmath31 appear to slightly depend on the thermal history ( i.e. on the cooling rate ) , an aspect that will be the subject of future studies .",
    "finally , we have checked that @xmath32 , the amplitude of the slow relaxing component , is zero above 20 k by recording the recovery up to more than @xmath106 @xmath39 ( fig.[t1vsfreq ] ) ."

    "<S> @xmath0as , @xmath1rb and @xmath2rb nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) and @xmath1rb nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements in rbfe@xmath3as@xmath3 iron - based superconductor are presented . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a marked broadening of @xmath0as nqr spectrum below @xmath4 k which is associated with the onset of a charge order in the feas planes . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath5 we observe a power - law decrease in @xmath0as nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate down to @xmath6 k. below @xmath7 the nuclei start to probe different dynamics owing to the different local electronic configurations induced by the charge order . a fraction of the nuclei probes spin dynamics associated with electrons approaching a localization while another fraction probes activated dynamics possibly associated with a pseudogap . </S>",
    "<S> these different trends are discussed in the light of an orbital selective behaviour expected for the electronic correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> the parent compounds of high temperature superconducting cuprates are emblematic examples of mott - hubbard insulators at half band filling,@xcite where the large electron coulomb repulsion @xmath8 overcomes the hopping integral @xmath9 and induces both charge localization and an antiferromagnetic ( af ) coupling among the spins . </S>",
    "<S> electronic correlations remain sizeable even when the cuprates become superconducting and give rise to a rich phase diagram at low hole doping levels characterized by the onset of a charge density wave ( cdw ) which progressively fades away as the doping increases @xcite and eventually , in the overdoped regime , a fermi liquid scenario is restored . the comprehension of the role of electronic correlations in iron - based superconductors ( ibs)@xcite is more subtle . at variance with the cuprates </S>",
    "<S> ibs are characterized by similar nearest neighbour and next - nearest neighbour hopping integrals , the parent compounds of the most studied families of ibs ( e.g. bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 and lafeaso)@xcite are not characterized by half - filled bands and , moreover , in ibs the fermi level typically crosses five bands associated with the different fe 3@xmath10 orbitals , leading to a rich phenomenology in the normal as well as in the superconducting state.@xcite moreover , even if signs have been reported @xcite , the evidence for a charge order in the phase diagram of ibs still remains elusive .    </S>",
    "<S> nominally , half band filling can be approached in bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 ibs by replacing ba with an alkali atom a = k , rb or cs , resulting in 5.5 electrons per fe atom.@xcite transport measurements show that afe@xmath3as@xmath3 compounds are metals@xcite with sizeable electronic correlations and it has been recently pointed out that their behaviour shares many similarities with that of heavy fermion compounds.@xcite indeed , the effective mass progressively increases as one moves from bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 to afe@xmath3as@xmath3,@xcite even if clear discrepancies in the values derived by the different techniques are found depending on their sensitivity to the electrons from a single band or from all the five bands.@xcite de medici et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite pointed out that if electronic correlations are sizeable , namely @xmath11 is of the order of the unity , the local atomic physics starts to be relevant and hund coupling may promote the single electron occupancy of fe @xmath10 orbitals ( i.e. half band - filling ) and decouple the interband charge correlations . accordingly the mott transition becomes orbital selective@xcite so that while the electrons of a given band localize the electrons of other bands remain delocalized , leading to a metallic behaviour and eventually to superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> this orbital selective behaviour should give rise to markedly @xmath12-dependent response functions @xcite and to a sort of @xmath12-space phase separation of metallic and insulating - like domains . </S>",
    "<S> the point is , what happens in the real space ? </S>",
    "<S> will one probe the sum of the insulating and metallic response functions or should one detect a real space phase separation@xcite also in afe@xmath3as@xmath3 ibs @xcite , with different local susceptibilities ? more interestingly , if electronic correlations become significant in afe@xmath3as@xmath3 one could envisage the onset of a charge order@xcite as in the cuprates.@xcite    nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) are quite powerful tools which allow to probe the local response function and charge distribution . moreover , in nqr experiments @xcite the magnetic field , which often acts as a relevant perturbation , is zero . here </S>",
    "<S> we show , by combining @xmath0as and @xmath13rb nqr and @xmath1rb nmr measurements , that in rbfe@xmath3as@xmath3 a charge order develops in the normal state below @xmath4 k , possibly leading to a differentiation in real space of fe atoms with different orbital configurations . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath5 , @xmath0as and @xmath1rb nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rates ( @xmath14 ) show a power law behaviour , as it is expected for a strongly correlated electron system and in good agreement with @xmath0as nmr results reported by wu et al.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , at @xmath6 k we observe that a fraction of @xmath0as ( or @xmath1rb ) nuclei probes spin dynamics characteristic of a system approaching localization while others probe dynamics possibly associated with a metallic phase with a pseudogap.@xcite upon further decreasing the temperature the volume fraction of the heavy electron phase vanishes while the one of the metallic phase , which eventually becomes superconducting below @xmath15 k , grows . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we present a neat evidence for a charge order in rbfe@xmath3as@xmath3 akin to underdoped cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> the charge order favours a phase separation into metallic and nearly insulating regions , which could result from the theoretically predicted orbital selective behaviour.@xcite    nqr and nmr measurements were performed on a rbfe@xmath3as@xmath3 polycrystalline sample with a mass of about 400 mg , sealed in a quartz tube under a 0.2 bar ar atmosphere in order to prevent deterioration . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting transition temperature derived from ac susceptibility measurements turned out @xmath15 k , in good agreement with previous findings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further details on the sample preparation and characterization are given in the supplemental material.@xcite    first of all we shall discuss the appearance of a charge order in the feas planes of rbfe@xmath3as@xmath3 , as detected by @xmath0as nqr spectra . for a nuclear spin @xmath16 , as it is the case of @xmath0as and @xmath1rb , the nqr spectrum is characterized by a single line at a frequency@xcite @xmath17 with @xmath18 the nuclear quadrupole moment , @xmath19 the main component of the electric field gradient ( efg ) tensor and @xmath20 its asymmetry @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the nqr spectrum probes the efg at the nuclei generated by the surrounding charge distribution . above 140 k , @xmath0as nqr spectrum ( fig.[figspec ] ) is centered around 14.6 mhz , with a linewidth of about 170 khz , while @xmath1rb nqr spectrum is centered around 6.2 mhz with a width of about 20 khz . </S>",

    "<S> we performed density functional theory ( dft ) calculations using elk code in the generalized gradient approximation@xcite in order to derive _ ab initio _ the electric field gradient and nqr frequency . for @xmath0as and @xmath1rb </S>",
    "<S> we obtained @xmath22 mhz and @xmath23 mhz , respectively , in reasonable agreement with the experimental values in spite of the significant electronic correlations.@xcite this shows that dft is still able to provide a fair description of the system as far as it remains a normal metal .    upon cooling the sample below @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> k significant changes are detected in @xmath0as nqr spectra ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> the spectrum is observed to progressively broaden with decreasing temperature and below 50 k one clearly observes that the spectrum is actually formed by two humps nearly symmetrically shifted with respect to the center ( fig.[figspec]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of two peaks in the @xmath0as nqr spectra has already been detected in different families of ibs and associated with a nanoscopic phase separation in regions characterized by different electron doping levels.@xcite however , at variance with what we observe here , the two peaks observed in other ibs do not show the same intensity @xcite and the spectra show little temperature dependence , namely the nanoscopic phase separation is likely pinned . under both high magnetic field and high pressure </S>",
    "<S> an asymmetric splitting of @xmath0as nmr spectrum was detected also in kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 which , however , is absent in zero field ( nqr).@xcite here we observe the emergence of an nqr spectrum which recalls the one expected for an incommensurate cdw,@xcite which causes a periodic modulation of the efg at the nuclei and gives rise to two symmetrically shifted peaks in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the efg modulation could involve also the onset of an orbital order@xcite or a structural distortion , possibly coupled to the charge order . </S>",
    "<S> although it is not straightforward from our data to discriminate among these scenarios , it is clear that we detect a symmetry breaking below @xmath5 to a low temperature phase characterized by a spatial modulation of the efg , namely by a charge order .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1rb nqr spectrum does not show a significant broadening upon decreasing the temperature but is characterized by a @xmath24 which , at @xmath25 k , shows a temperature dependence similar to that of the @xmath0as nqr spectra full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , proportional to the charge order parameter ( fig.[figspec]c ) . below </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 @xmath1rb @xmath24 flattens and deviates from @xmath0as nqr fwhm . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the nqr spectrum of the out of plane @xmath1rb nuclei is less sensitive than @xmath0as one to the charge order is an indication that the order develops in the feas planes and that the modulation of the efg at @xmath0as nuclei should occur over a few lattice steps , otherwise one should expect a splitting also of the narrow @xmath1rb nqr spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to notice that at a temperature of the order of @xmath7 an abrupt change in the uniaxial thermal expansion occurs,@xcite evidencing also a change in the lattice properties .    </S>",
    "<S> now we discuss the temperature dependence of the low - energy dynamics probed by @xmath0as and @xmath1rb @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate was determined from the recovery of the nuclear magnetization after exciting the nuclear spins with a saturation recovery pulse sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the recovery of @xmath0as magnetization in nqr is shown in fig.[figrec]a . </S>",
    "<S> one notices that a single exponential recovery describes very well the recovery of the nuclear magnetization at @xmath26 k , as it can be expected for a homogeneous system where all nuclei probe the same dynamics </S>",
    "<S> . however , below @xmath6 k one observes the appearance of a second component characterized by much longer relaxation times . </S>",
    "<S> namely , a part of the nuclei probes dynamics causing a fast relaxation ( @xmath27 ) and a part of the nuclei a slow relaxation ( @xmath28 ) . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the recovery was fit to @xmath29 \\,\\,\\ </S>",
    "<S> , , \\ ] ] with @xmath30 the nuclear magnetization at thermal equilibrium , @xmath31 and @xmath32 the fraction of fast relaxing and slow relaxing nuclei , respectively , @xmath33 a factor accounting for a non perfect saturation by the radiofrequency pulses and @xmath34 a stretching exponent characterizing the slowly relaxing component . as the temperature is lowered </S>",
    "<S> one observes a progressive increase of @xmath32 with respect to @xmath31 and at the lowest temperature ( @xmath35 k ) , about 80% of the nuclei are characterized by the slow relaxation ( fig.[figrec]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to notice that in rbfe@xmath3as@xmath3 wu et al.@xcite ( in nmr , not in nqr ) did not observe a clear separation of the recovery in two components as we do here but they did observe deviations from a single exponential recovery below 20 k which , however , were fitted with a stretched exponential , likely yielding an average @xmath14 value between @xmath28 and @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably also @xmath1rb nmr @xmath14 clearly shows two components below 25 k and just one above.@xcite    @xmath0as @xmath14 was measured both on the high frequency and on the low - frequency shoulder of the nqr spectrum and it was found to be the same ( fig.[figt1]a ) over a broad temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , at @xmath36 k we carefully checked the frequency dependence of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 and found that neither the two relaxation rates nor their amplitude vary across the spectrum ( fig.[figrec]b , see also ref . ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that nuclei resonating at different frequencies probe the same dynamics which implies that the charge modulation induced by the charge order has a nanoscopic periodicity.@xcite one could argue that the two components are actually present at all temperatures but that they arise only at low temperature once nuclear spin diffusion@xcite is no longer able to establish a common spin temperature ( i.e. a common @xmath39 ) among the nuclei resonating at different frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> however , we remark that since the nuclear spin - spin relaxation rate ( @xmath40 ) is constant @xcite and the width of the nqr spectrum is nearly constant below 40 k ( fig.[figspec]c ) the poor efficiency of nuclear spin diffusion should not vary , at least for @xmath41 k. hence , the appearance of different relaxation rates below @xmath7 should arise from a phase separation causing a slight change in the average electronic charge distribution causing little effect on the nqr spectra ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figspec ] ) but a marked differentiation in the low - energy excitations @xcite , which starts to be significant at low temperature </S>",
    "<S> once the effect of electronic correlations is relevant .    </S>",
    "<S> one has to clarify if the relaxation mechanism is magnetic , driven by electron spin fluctuations , or quadrupolar , driven by efg fluctuations , typically induced by cdw amplitude and phase modes.@xcite in order to clarify this point we measured the ratio between @xmath1rb and @xmath2rb @xmath14 ( fast component ) at a few selected temperatures below 25 k. the ratio @xmath42 , in good agreement with the ratio between the square of the gyromagnetic ratios of the two nuclei @xmath43 , showing that the relaxation is driven by the correlated spin fluctuations and not by charge fluctuations associated with cdw excitations . since @xmath0as shows a temperature dependence of the relaxation analogous to the one of @xmath1rb ( fig.[figt1]a ) we argue that also @xmath0as @xmath14 is driven by spin fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can write that @xmath44 the form factor giving the hyperfine coupling with the collective spin excitations at wave - vector @xmath45 , and @xmath46 the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility at the resonance frequency @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we turn to the temperature dependence of @xmath14 above @xmath6 k and of @xmath28 and @xmath27 below that temperature . above </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 @xmath14 increases with a power law @xmath48 , with @xmath49 for @xmath0as , and flattens around @xmath4 k ( fig.[figt1]a ) , in very good agreement with the results reported by wu et al.@xcite from @xmath0as nmr . </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath5 corresponds to the temperature below which we start to observe a significant broadening of @xmath0as nqr spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the power law behaviour of @xmath14 seems to arise from the onset of the charge order .    </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath6 k @xmath27 deviates from the power law behaviour and progressively flattens on decreasing temperature ( fig.[figt1]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the same behaviour is detected for @xmath1rb nmr @xmath14 , although the flattening starts at a higher temperature , suggesting that @xmath7 might be field dependent . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , @xmath28 gets progressively longer as the temperature is lowered and follows an activated trend with an energy barrier @xmath50 k.    the behaviour of @xmath27 is characteristic of a system approaching a qcp where localization occurs . in fact , from moriya self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) approach for a quasi-2d system with af correlations , one should have @xmath51,@xcite with @xmath52 the static susceptibility at the af wave - vector . in the proximity of the qcp @xmath53 , </S>",
    "<S> leading to a weak logarithmic divergence of @xmath54 for @xmath55 , while at higher temperature @xmath52 should show a curie - weiss behaviour , yielding a nearly flat @xmath14 , as we do observe in rbfe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( fig.[figt1]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding behaviour of @xmath56 is reported in fig.[figt1]b .    on the other hand , @xmath57 , corresponding to the relaxation rate of the majority phase at low temperature , shows the opposite trend ( fig.[figt1]b ) , decreasing upon cooling . </S>",
    "<S> being the system metallic at low temperature , the deviation of @xmath57 from the constant korringa - like behaviour @xcite expected for a metal should possibly be associated with the opening of a pseudogap , similarly to what one observes in the underdoped regime of the cuprates,@xcite and in agreement with theoretical predictions for hole - doped ibs.@xcite    in conclusion , our results show that , akin to cuprates , a charge order develops also in the normal state of ibs when the electronic correlations are sizeable . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the presence of a charge order appears to be a common feature in the phase diagram of cuprate and iron - based superconductors and could play a key role in determining the superconducting state properties.@xcite moreover , we observe a local electronic separation in two phases characterized by different excitations which could possibly be explained in terms of the orbital selective behaviour@xcite predicted for ibs . </S>",
    "<S> finally we remark that the occurrence of an electronic phase separation is theoretically supported by a recent study of the electron fluid compressibility . </S>"
