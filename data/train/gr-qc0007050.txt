    "interferometric detectors such as ligo and virgo rely on exquisite sensitivity to the positions of hanging test masses in order to detect the perturbations of passing gravitational radiation .",
    "the sensitivity is so great that the measurements can also be affected by fluctuations in the local newtonian gravitational field , which create tiny accelerations of the mass .",
    "this noise source , known as gravity gradient noise or newtonian gravitational noise , is caused by the near - field gravity of masses moving near the interferometer , and is not to be confused with the far - field propagating gravitational waves that the instruments are intended to measure .",
    "gravity gradient noise has the potential to be quite insidious , since it can not be shielded by improvements to the test - mass vibrational isolation .",
    "the only effective way to eliminate gravity gradient noise is to eliminate the moving masses that create the perturbing fields .",
    "fortunately , though , the strongest perturbations to the local gravitational field are at frequencies well below the detectors pass - bands .",
    "since the proposed terrestrial interferometric detectors all have sensitivity cutoffs around 3  hz or higher , we need only worry about noise sources that can perturb the local gravity field on timescales less than about 0.3  seconds . most of the noise sources that i consider are motivated by the expected sensitivity of advanced ligo interferometers , which were originally projected to have a low - frequency cutoff around 10  hz , and instrumental noise of @xmath0 in the gravitational - wave signal output at that frequency  @xcite .",
    "although changes in instrumentation technology will modify the ultimate sensitivity goals of ligo , this `` standard '' advanced ligo noise level is a good reference point when considering new noise sources . also ,",
    "as pointed out below , gravity gradient noise will make it difficult to push the detector noise much below this level at 10  hz , regardless of improvements to the interferometers .",
    "saulson  @xcite was the first to estimate the effect of gravity gradient noise on terrestrial interferometric detectors , considering the effects of seismic waves passing through the earth and of sound waves in the air . in both cases",
    "he found the spectral density of noise in the interferometer path - length difference to be less than @xmath1 around 10  hz , corresponding to noise in the gravitational - wave signal at levels less than @xmath2 for a 4  km interferometer . by comparison , this is significantly less than the noise floor of @xmath3 that advanced ligo interferometers expect to achieve at 10  hz .",
    "more recently , a detailed analysis  @xcite has been made of seismic gravity gradient noise ; this study indicated that seismic gravity gradient noise would be within a factor of 2 of the advanced ligo noise floor at 10  hz for most times , and could actually _ exceed _ this noise floor during seismically noisy times , making seismic gravity gradients a significant barrier to improvements in low - frequency sensitivity .",
    "it therefore seems prudent to revisit the issue of _ atmospheric _ gravity gradients as well .    in sec .",
    "[ s : atmospheric - pressure - waves ] i consider gravity gradients caused by atmospheric pressure perturbations  the same noise source considered by saulson .",
    "attention is paid , however , to the effects of the ground , and of buildings that reduce the pressure noise in the immediate vicinity of the interferometer test masses .",
    "nonetheless , i find that these tend only to weaken the gravity gradient noise in the pass - bands of interferometric detectors , reinforcing the conclusion that this noise source is not of any great concern",
    ".    a much stronger source of high - frequency density perturbations in the atmosphere is the presence of temperature fluctuations , which are advected past a detector by the wind . in sec .",
    "[ s : atmospheric - temperature - perturbations ] i analyze this as a potential source of gravity gradient noise .",
    "however , i find that while small - scale temperature perturbations can produce high - frequency temperature fluctuations at any given point , they do not produce the same high - frequency fluctuations in the test mass position , since a given pocket of warm or cool air will affect the test mass gravitationally over the entire time that it is in the vicinity of the test mass , which is on the order of seconds .",
    "this produces a cutoff in the noise spectrum above a few tenths of a hz .",
    "the presence of turbulent vortices around the interferometer buildings can increase the high - frequency component , but still probably not enough to show up in the gravitational - wave noise spectrum .    in secs .",
    "[ s : shockwaves ] and  [ s : high - speed - objects ] i turn away from sources of background noise to consider possible sources of transient gravity gradient signals that might be detected as spurious events in the gravitational - wave instruments .",
    "[ s : shockwaves ] extends the analysis in sec .",
    "[ s : atmospheric - pressure - waves ] to look at the effects of atmospheric shockwaves , such as might be generated by an explosion or supersonic aircraft .",
    "i find that sources such as these can indeed produce detectable signals that might be interpreted spuriously as gravitational - wave events .",
    "however , such signals would easily be vetoed using acoustic monitors outside the interferometer buildings .",
    "[ s : high - speed - objects ] analyzes the gravity gradients produced by individual objects , such as wind - borne debris , moving around outside the interferometer buildings .",
    "saulson considered this effect for the case of objects moving with fairly uniform velocity , but typically , in order to produce significant signal above 3  hz , an object s motion must be changing on timescales of less than 0.3  seconds . in particular , i find that objects _ colliding _ with the interferometer buildings produce much stronger signals than objects simply passing by the buildings .",
    "as an example , tumbleweeds at the hanford ligo facility will be a steady source of spurious signals in advanced detectors if they are allowed to collide with the end stations .",
    "preventing such signals requires shielding a region of a few tens of meters around the end station , screening any wind - borne debris that masses more than a few hundred grammes .",
    "[ s : gradient - conclusions ] presents some concluding remarks , including recommendations to the gravitational - wave experimental groups and possible directions for further research .",
    "pressure perturbations are the only type of atmospheric gravity gradient noise considered by saulson  @xcite .",
    "the derivation in this section gives largely the same result as his .",
    "consider a plane pressure wave with frequency @xmath4 propagating through a homogeneous airspace at some sound speed @xmath5 .",
    "if the fractional pressure change @xmath6 is small , it will induce an adiabatic density change @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the ratio of heat capacities at constant pressure and constant temperature for air at normal temperatures .",
    "the gravitational acceleration produced by this wave in the direction of propagation @xmath9 is : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the ambient air density and pressure , and @xmath13 is the pressure perturbation measured at the same point as the acceleration is being measured . by symmetry , there is no acceleration transverse to the wave .",
    "now consider sound waves in the vicinity of the interferometer .",
    "first , since the interferometer is only sensitive to motions of the test mass parallel to the arms , the gravitational acceleration is reduced by a factor @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the angle between the propagation direction and the interferometer arm .",
    "second , the interferometer test mass is inside a building , which can in principle be used to suppress noise within a distance @xmath16 of the test mass . roughly speaking , this results in a high - frequency cutoff factor @xmath17 , where the function @xmath18 depends on the precise shape of the building ,",
    "the manner in which it reflects sound waves , and many other factors , but is normally close to 1 for @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , if one simply removes from the volume integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pressure - gradient - homogeneous ] ) a cylinder with length and diameter both @xmath20 aligned with the @xmath21-axis , then @xmath22 for @xmath19 , but oscillates with an amplitude of @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "this function is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoff ] .",
    "the constant - amplitude oscillations of @xmath18 for large @xmath25 reflect the assumption that the sound wave has a coherence length much longer than the building size , so the field between the two ends of the excluded cylinder is generated almost entirely by the first half - wavelength beyond each cap .",
    "realistically , the actual high - frequency behaviour of @xmath18 will depend on how the sound waves bend and scatter around the building ; however , this should not change the order of magnitude of @xmath18 .",
    "the behaviour shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoff ] is therefore probably a good estimate of the true cutoff function for @xmath19 , and a reasonable order of magnitude estimate for @xmath24 .",
    "for the ligo end stations , @xmath16 is of order 5  metres , giving @xmath26 ; the factor will not be too far off for the frequencies of greatest interest .",
    "more precise estimates would depend on the specific architectural details of a particular facility .",
    "third , the interferometer is on the ground , not in homogeneous empty space .",
    "for simplicity i assume that the waves are almost entirely reflected off the ground ; i will justify this assumption in sec .",
    "[ ss : ground - absorption ] . in this case",
    "the gravity gradient in directions parallel to the ground contributed by the reflected wavefront is the same as if the wavefront were extended below ground , while the pressure perturbations measured by detectors near the ground ( much less than a wavelength ) will be doubled .",
    "the acceleration experienced by an interferometer test mass is therefore : @xmath27    the gravitational wave signal @xmath28 in the interferometer is related to the acceleration of one of the test masses by @xmath29 , or in frequency space @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the length of the interferometer arm .",
    "thus : @xmath32 assuming stationary noise , the one - sided spectral density @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes an expectation over all random phases of all plane wave modes contributing to the noise , and @xmath36 denotes complex conjugation . taking mode amplitudes and directions to be uncorrelated ,",
    "this gives : @xmath37 ^ 2      \\langle\\cos^2\\theta\\rangle \\frac{s_p(|f|)}{p^2 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the acoustic noise spectral density measured outside the building in the vicinity of a particular test mass .",
    "since the two test masses in an arm are many wavelengths apart , their noise will be uncorrelated , and will thus add in noise power .",
    "similarly , the noise from the two arms will add in power .",
    "( actually this is a bit of an overestimate , since the noise in the motion of the test masses at the corner station will be somewhat correlated . ) noting that @xmath39 , one finds that the total noise in the gravitational wave signal is : @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes a particular test mass in the interferometer , @xmath42 is the dead air radius about the @xmath41th test mass , and @xmath43 is the acoustic noise spectrum measured outside the building enclosing that test mass .",
    "infrasound noise spectra should be taken at the actual interferometer sites , but one can make estimates based on typical terrestrial atmospheric noise .",
    "an empirical study  @xcite collected 256 power spectra of 116  hz infrasound data from a rural forest 50 km from new york city over a period of months , and found that the average noise spectrum @xmath44 was relatively flat at 616  hz , though with widely varying amplitude : 25% of the spectra had noise under @xmath45 , 50% under @xmath46 , and 75% under @xmath47 .",
    "i use eq .",
    "( [ eq : pressure - noise - total ] ) to compute the corresponding noise in the ligo detector .",
    "assuming that the end masses ( with @xmath48 ) dominate the contribution to the gravity gradient noise and contribute equally , the noise in the gravitational - wave signal around 10  hz is : @xmath49 the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure - noise ] , using infrasound power spectra read off of fig .  3 of  @xcite .",
    "even the third - quartile power spectrum is between two and three orders of magnitude below the expected noise floor of @xmath50 at 10  hz projected for advanced ligo interferometers .",
    "thus ambient infrasound is probably a negligible effect for determining the noise floor for most interferometric gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "nonetheless the issue can not be completely resolved without infrasonic noise data from the actual interferometer sites .      in the derivation above",
    "i treated the sound waves as being reflected off the ground .",
    "now consider what happens if a sound wave is absorbed by the ground .",
    "the energy flux in a traveling compression wave is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the compression modulus of the medium ( @xmath53 ) , and @xmath54 is the average squared dimensionless compression factor over a wave cycle .",
    "the gravity gradient noise induced by such a wave goes as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the wave speed in that medium .",
    "therefore , if a sound wave is completely absorbed by the ground , the resulting ground motions will produce gravity gradient noise contributions in the ratio : @xmath58    now for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , the ratio turns out to be of order @xmath63 ; that is , if sound waves were completely absorbed by the ground , the resulting ground vibrations would produce gravity gradient noise levels about 1000 times greater than the atmospheric gravity gradients .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that seismic gravity gradients are only just large enough to worry about .",
    "so the only way that atmospheric gravity gradients can be larger or of the same order as seismic gravity gradients is if the waves are mostly reflected off of the ground .",
    "this was one of the assumptions used in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : pressure - gradient - interferometer ] ) .",
    "the largest small - scale atmospheric density perturbations are caused not by pressure waves but by temperature perturbations .",
    "as heat is transported up through a convective atmospheric layer , convective turbulence mixes pockets of warm and cool air to form temperature perturbations on all lengthscales down to a few millimetres . on the timescales of interest ( less than a second )",
    "these perturbations are effectively `` frozen '' into the airmass , while pressure differences disperse rapidly in the form of sound waves .",
    "perturbations in the air density @xmath64 are therefore caused predominantly by the temperature perturbations , which are typically several orders of magnitude larger than the pressure perturbations .",
    "although they are frozen into the airmass , these temperature perturbations can cause rapid time - varying density fluctuations @xmath65 as the wind carries them past a point in space .",
    "this is the primary source of `` seeing '' noise that affects optical astronomy .",
    "the appendix to this chapter gives a rigorous mathematical derivation of the gravity gradient noise spectrum due to these temperature perturbations .",
    "this section gives a qualitative derivation that reproduces the final result to order of magnitude .",
    "the gravity gradient signal at some frequency @xmath4 is caused by pockets of warm or cool air with some lengthscale @xmath66 being advected past the interferometer test mass at a speed @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "consider a single such pocket of air with a temperature perturbation @xmath69 away from the ambient temperature @xmath70 .",
    "the gravitational acceleration produced in the instrument as a function of time @xmath71 is @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the ambient air density , @xmath74 is the distance of the air pocket from the test mass as it is blown past , and @xmath75 is this distance projected onto the axis of the interferometer arm .",
    "this geometry is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : streamlines - approx ] .",
    "now in general , the noise power spectral density in any quantity @xmath76 due to a background of independent , uncorrelated events is @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the fourier spectrum from a single event and @xmath79 is the spacing between events .",
    "assuming uncorrelated pockets of air , then independent pockets of air arrive along any given streamline at intervals @xmath80 , and streamlines separated by more than @xmath66 add noise incoherently ( i.e. , add linearly in power ) .",
    "this gives the following noise spectrum : @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes an integral over a plane crossing all streamlines @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the fourier transform of the function @xmath85 taken along a given streamline .",
    "the quantity @xmath86 is the average squared temperature difference between points a distance @xmath66 apart .",
    "turbulent mixing theory , as well as actual micrometeorological measurements , predict a power - law behaviour for small separations : @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is typically @xmath89 .",
    "this applies for horizontal separations @xmath66 up to of order 50  times the height of a given air pocket above the ground  @xcite . for streamlines more than a metre or so above ground level , then , this behaviour for @xmath90 should be good out to distances @xmath91 m , corresponding to frequencies @xmath92 .",

    "( [ eq : g - noise - approx ] ) and the relation @xmath68 yields : @xmath96    the more rigorous analysis in the appendix ( sec .  [ a : temperature - noise - spectrum ] ) gives an expression with roughly the same form , but covers the factors of order unity , and also accounts for the fact that wind speed can vary along a streamline and between streamlines .",
    "the more accurate formula is : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the wind speed of the streamline as it crosses the plane of integration , and @xmath99 and @xmath100 are fourier transforms of functions @xmath101 and @xmath102 describing the motion of a point along a streamline @xmath83 past a test mass @xmath103 , of the form : @xmath104    it is worth noting that the frequency structure of @xmath33 depends on the time behaviour of the functions @xmath75 and @xmath74 describing the position of a point on a streamline relative to a test mass , which can be some distance away .",
    "the minimum distance @xmath16 from the test mass to the passing air is thus an additional important scale in the problem : if @xmath75 and @xmath74 change significantly only on timescales @xmath105 , then the noise spectrum will be cut off at frequencies @xmath106 .    by comparison , the _ temperature _ noise spectrum @xmath107 measured at a point depends only on the local properties of the atmosphere at that point . applying similar order - of - magnitude arguments , one can write @xmath108 , where @xmath109 for @xmath110 and 0 otherwise . at high frequencies",

    "clearly the exponential cutoff makes this a negligible source of noise for ligo or similar detectors .",
    "physically this cutoff arises from the fact that the gravity from a particular temperature perturbation passing near the end station will affect the test mass coherently over the second or so that it takes to travel the width of the end station .",

    "gravity gradients from atmospheric shockwaves are potentially serious sources of spurious signals in interferometric gravitational - wave detectors . for instance , the sonic boom from a supersonic aircraft overflying an advanced ligo detector could produce signal - to - noise ratios of several hundred .",
    "although such overflights are expected to be rare or nonexistent , they point out the potential seriousness of shocks from weaker or more distant sources , even if the signals are several orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "it is therefore _",
    "strongly _ recommended that advanced interferometric detectors include infrasonic detectors as environmental monitors .",
    "such sensors could easily be employed to veto spurious atmospheric gravity - gradient events .",
