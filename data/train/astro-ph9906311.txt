    "it is plausible that the submillimetre - selected galaxies and the lyman - break galaxies are associated with temporally distinct phases of a common population of merging dark matter haloes .",
    "a scenario in which a short - lived , highly obscured far - infrared starburst / agn phase dominates the integrated luminosity of the merger and is surrounded in time by a less luminous , more lightly obscured phase that lasts about 10 times longer is consistent with the data . in this scenario ,",
    "the merger would be classified as a scuba galaxy if it was observed during the short - lived phase , and as a lyman - break galaxy during the long - lived phase .",
    "the results presented here provide excellent opportunities for further study .",
    "two key scientific questions remain unanswered .",
    "first , what are the physical processes that are responsible for the evolution of both the star - formation / agn - fuelling efficiency and the activity parameter in galaxy mergers as a function of redshift ?",
    "secondly , what is the relationship between samples of faint galaxies selected in the optical waveband and submillimetre - selected galaxies",
    "? larger samples of submillimetre - selected galaxies and more comprehensive multiwaveband follow - up observations will allow these questions to be answered .",

    "<S> a large fraction of the luminous distant submillimetre - wave galaxies recently detected using the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) camera on the james clerk maxwell telescope appear to be associated with interacting optical counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the nature of these systems using a simple hierarchical clustering model of galaxy evolution , in which the large luminosity of the scuba galaxies is assumed to be generated at the epoch of galaxy mergers in a burst of either star formation activity or the fuelling of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> the models are well constrained by the observed spectrum of the far - infrared / submillimetre - wave background radiation and the 60-@xmath0 m counts of low - redshift _ iras _ galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio between the total amount of energy released during mergers and the mass of dark matter involved must increase sharply with redshift @xmath1 at @xmath2 , and then decrease at greater redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> this result is independent of the fraction of the luminosity of mergers that is produced by starbursts and agn . </S>",
    "<S> one additional parameter  the reciprocal of the product of the duration of the enhanced luminosity produced by the merger and the fraction of mergers that induce an enhanced luminosity , which we call the activity parameter  is introduced , to allow the relationship between merging dark matter haloes and the observed counts of distant dusty galaxies to be investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the observed counts can only be reproduced if the activity parameter is greater by a factor of about 5 and 100 at redshifts of 1 and 3 respectively , as compared with the present epoch . </S>",
    "<S> hence , if merging galaxies account for the population of scuba galaxies , then the merger process must have been much more violent at high redshifts . we discuss the counts of galaxies and the intensity of background radiation in the optical / near - infrared wavebands in the context of these hierarchical models , and thus investigate the relationship between the populations of submillimetre - selected and lyman - break galaxies .    </S>",
