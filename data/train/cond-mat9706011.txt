    "the liquid - gas phase transition in electrolytes is of current interest because of puzzling experiments and theoretical efforts to understand them . for recent reviews ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the primary model used is the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) consisting of two oppositely charged , but otherwise identical , sets of @xmath2 hard spheres of diameter @xmath3 and charge per particle @xmath4 , immersed in a medium of dielectric constant @xmath5 ( to represent the solvent ) and volume @xmath6 .",
    "we will restrict our attention to the rpm in @xmath7 dimensions and use the reduced temperature and density @xmath8 where @xmath9 ; the debye inverse screening length , @xmath10 the reduced helmholtz free energy density @xmath11 and the reduced configurational energy per particle , @xmath12 , defined via @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the total free energy and ( internal ) energy .",
    "recent theory@xcite has focussed on two approaches to approximating the free energy of the rpm , based on either debye - hckel ( dh ) theory@xcite or the mean spherical approximation ( msa)@xcite .",
    "many years ago bjerrum@xcite proposed to improve dh theory by including ion pairing via `` chemical association . ''",
    "later , ebeling and grigo@xcite combined ion - pairing with an msa expression for the ionic free energy ; more recently , levin and fisher @xcite and stell and coworkers@xcite explored further extensions of the msa . on the other hand ,",
    "fisher and levin@xcite supplemented dh theory not only with ion pairing and excluded - volume terms but also included the solvation free energy of the electrically active @xmath16 dipolar ion pairs .",
    "currently , this class of dh - based theories seems to give the best , albeit semiquantitative , account of the rpm in the critical region as judged by comparison with simulations performed by various authors@xcite .",
    "it may be remarked that the simulation estimates for @xmath17 and @xmath18 have been changing at an alarming rate [ 2(b ) ] .",
    "nevertheless , the msa - based theories yield approximations for @xmath19 that are significantly _ higher _ than those based on the dh approach ( @xmath20 ) , which in fact agrees much better with the simulations ( @xmath21)@xcite .    at a purely theoretical level , however , one can not be content since , _ a priori _ , there seem no clear grounds for preferring the dh - based theories  apart from their more direct and intuitive physical interpretation  rather than the more modern ( and fashionable ) msa - based theories which  since they entail the pair correlation functions and the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) relation  give the impression of being more firmly rooted in statistical mechanics .",
    "on the other hand , it has recently been shown that the dh theories yield pair correlations satisfying the oz relation in a very natural way@xcite . furthermore , both theories have an essentially mean - field character despite which , in contrast to typical mean field theories for lattice systems , _ neither _ has any known gibbs - bogoliubov variational formulation or similar basis .",
    "how , then , might the two approaches be distinguished ?",
    "now blum and his coworkers have , in various places@xcite , enthusiastically sung the praises of the msa for the rpm , asserting that the theory `` @xmath22is asymptotically correct in the limit of high density and infinite charge '' or `` high screening parameter ( debye length going to zero ) . '' furthermore , `` unlike the dh theory , it [ the msa ] satisfies the exact onsager bounds for the helmholtz free energy and the internal energy''@xcite ( in the same asymptotic limit ) and the `` internal energy of the msa is an exact lower bound''@xcite .",
    "as reported below , these claims can not be sustained : however , they do suggest that one might usefully assess and compare the msa and dh theories , and their various extensions , by checking their predictions against previously developed bounds for the internal energy and helmholtz free energy .",
    "that task is undertaken here .    indeed , as discussed more fully in sec .",
    "@xmath23ii , several bounds have been established . the well - known onsager _ lower _ bound for the _ configurational energy _ of the rpm was derived in 1939 @xcite ; less heralded is an improvement due to totsuji some forty years later @xcite .",
    "for the _ free energy _ , rasaiah and stell @xcite proved that the hard - core free energy provides an _ upper _ bound , while gillan @xcite developed a much stronger upper bound embodying the idea of @xmath16 pairing into dipoles@xcite .",
    "finally , we note that thermodynamic stability with respect to temperature requires the positivity of the specific heat at constant volume @xcite .",
    "we will focus particularly on the totsuji and gillan bounds applied in the region of the predicted gas - liquid phase transition and critical point .",
    "we find that dh theory and all its augmentations always _ satisfy _",
    "totsuji s ( and onsager s ) bound provided @xmath24 . on the other hand ,",
    "the msa actually _ violates _ the totsuji bound in a significant region of the @xmath25 plane where coexistence is predicted , unless the theory is suitably augmented .    in the light cast by gillan s bound",
    ", the two approaches rest on a more equal footing .",
    "as already shown by gillan @xcite , the msa ( in its usual form ) fails badly for @xmath26 ; but the same is true for the original dh theory ( even when supplemented by excluded - volume terms @xcite ) .",
    "only when both basic theories are augmented by ion - pairing contributions and by allowing for the associated depletion of the free - ion screening do they satisfy the gillan bound . as against the hard - core electrostatic effects ,",
    "included in _ both _ dh and msa treatments , the presence or absence of specific excluded - volume terms has small effect numerically and does not affect the satisfaction of the bound .",
    "however , the recent pmsa ( or pairing - msa ) theories of stell and coworkers @xcite violate gillan s bound apparently because they do not account appropriately for the free - ion depletion .",
    "the main lesson is the crucial importance of the clustering of ions into dipolar pairs at low temperatures .",
    "of course , this has been appreciated heuristically for a long time @xcite and was quantitatively demonstrated in 1983 by gillan @xcite in calculations for the rpm which showed that the vapor for @xmath27 consisted mainly of @xmath16 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 neutral clusters and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 singly charged clusters , with relatively far fewer free monopoles , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the present work , however , seems to be the first purely analytic demonstration of the thermodynamic necessity for including clustering , implicitly or , perhaps , explicitly , in approximate theories .",
    "the recognition of @xmath16 ion - pairing requires the specification of the corresponding _ association constant _",
    ", @xmath37 .",
    "ever since bjerrum s original proposal @xcite , this has been a matter of confusion and contention ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the low temperature region of principal interest here , say @xmath38 , bjerrum s cutoff form and ebeling s more sophisticated expression agree to within 1.8% or better @xcite and , along with other cutoff forms , have identical asymptotic expansions in powers of @xmath39 @xcite . for practical purposes , therefore",
    ", @xmath37 might be regarded as known `` exactly . '' at higher temperatures , where pairing should be ( and is predicted to be ) much weaker , it is natural to surmise that different treatments of association would prove inconsequential .",
    "however , this proves false ! indeed , for all the previous pairing theories @xcite we find that the constant - volume configurational specific heat becomes _ negative _ ( violating thermodynamics @xcite and statistical mechanics ) in the region @xmath40 : see sec .",
    "the source of this serious problem is found in the proposed behavior of the association constant .",
    "initial steps towards amelioration are indicated , but the issue will be pursued in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that we also examine the generalized msa ( gmsa ) @xcite and variants of the msa thermodynamics derived from the ( approximate ) pair correlation functions by routes other than the standard energy equation @xcite : these are discussed in sec .",
    "other even less realistic models for electrolytes exist , including the one - component plasma with hard cores @xcite and the corresponding `` dense - point limit '' [ 11(c ) ] ; however , we address here only the rpm .",
    "the explicit comparisons of the dh and msa theories _ without _ allowance for ion pairing are presented in sec .",
    "iii , below . in sec .",
    "iv the theories that include descriptions of ion pairing are assessed , including the pmsa theories @xcite .",
    "the first rigorous lower bound for the configurational energy of the rpm seems to be due to onsager @xcite .",
    "it is essentially a consequence of the positivity of the total electrostatic potential energy density and , with the notation of ( [ equdef ] ) , yields @xmath41 a more transparent derivation for a system with a neutralizing background has been presented by rosenfeld and gelbart @xcite .",
    "totsuji , in 1981 @xcite , improved on onsager s result by writing the energy as an integral over the ionic pair correlation functions and showing that the presence of the hard - core repulsions implies an upper bound on the correlation functions .",
    "he thence established @xmath42 although the improvement is by only @xmath43 , it has significant consequences .    as remarked by totsuji",
    ", one may usefully compare these bounds with the electrostatic or madelung energies of an ionic crystal ; for the nacl ( sc ) and cscl ( bcc ) structures one has @xcite",
    "@xmath44 one may reasonably suppose that the latter represents the best possible lower bound and so we will also invoke it in testing approximate theories for the rpm .",
    "gillan @xcite has developed a convincing , but not fully rigorous , upper bound on the helmholtz free energy of the rpm , which incorporates the idea of ion pairing .",
    "the pure hard - core free energy actually provides a rigorous upper bound @xcite , but gillan s bound is lower except for extremely low densities @xmath45 where the limiting behavior is well understood .",
    "here we utilize only gillan s bound , which is derived with the aid of the gibbs - bogoliubov inequality by employing a sequence of truncated reference systems .",
    "the calculation finally incorporates paired @xmath16 ions or dipoles by using a reference system of over - sized , spherically - capped cylinders with modified coulomb interactions .",
    "the last step of gillan s argument relies on a comparison of an approximate analytical expression for the pressure of a system of such spherocylinders with computer simulation estimates@xcite : the approximate formula appears to provide a bound on the true results . a search of the more recent literature concerning this system ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) indicates that the original simulations have withstood the test of time .",
    "( however , frenkel @xcite has observed that at high densities and for length / diameter ratios larger than needed here , the simulations  and , certainly , the analytic approximation  miss an isotropic - nematic fluid transition that is to be expected . ) we thus believe that gillan s bound is valid .",
    "to display the bound explicitly , we write the diameter and the chosen @xcite center - to - center distance of the spherocylinders as @xmath46 and put @xmath47 if @xmath48 is the ideal - gas free energy density , we then have @xcite @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 } \\right \\ } .\\ ] ] we will adopt @xmath52 , which gillan found optimized the bound for most values of @xmath53 .",
    "debye - hckel theory@xcite ( here referred to as `` pure '' dh theory , since explicit dipolar pairing is not included ) is the oldest theory for electrolytes still in current use .",
    "the theory entails two approximations : first , the pair correlation functions , @xmath54 , are represented by naive boltzmann factors  with the charge , @xmath55 , multiplied by the average electrostatic potential at @xmath56 when an ion of charge @xmath57 is fixed at @xmath58  ignoring higher order correlation effects ; and , second , these boltzmann factors are linearized , which is valid only in the limit of low density , small charge , or high temperature .",
    "( for a modern discussion , see mcquarrie @xcite . )",
    "the thermodynamics predicted by dh theory depends only on the single parameter , @xmath59 .",
    "the appearance of the hard core diameter , @xmath3 , demonstrates that dh theory takes account of the electrostatic effects of the hard cores ; however , the original or pure dh theory did not treat the excluded - volume effects of the hard cores ( and so reduced to a theory for an ideal gas mixture in the limit of vanishing charge , @xmath60 ) .",
    "nonetheless , excluded volume contributions may be included naturally by adding to the free energy a suitably chosen pure hard - core term @xcite ; see below . in the dh critical region ,",
    "such terms have a relatively small effect .",
    "the other `` basic '' theory we consider , the mean spherical approximation@xcite , is defined by a closure of the ornstein - zernike relation in which the @xmath61 vanish _ inside _ the hard core , while the direct correlation functions _ outside _ the hard - core exclusion zone are approximated by the coulombic potentials . waisman and lebowitz@xcite solved the msa exactly for the rpm : that is , they determined the correlation functions which , in principle , yield the thermodynamics .",
    "the electrostatic free energy again depends only on @xmath62 , but it and the overall free energy depend strongly on the theoretical route taken  via , in particular , the energy , pressure , or compressibility relations . since very different results are obtained , we review them briefly .",
    "the standard msa thermodynamics almost invariably discussed in the literature employs the energy route ; but as a result , _ no excluded - volume hard - core terms are generated .",
    "_ typically this problem is overcome by adding in appropriate terms `` by hand , '' just as for dh theory @xcite . in light of this fact , the conceptual advantage sometimes claimed for the standard msa in comparison to dh theory ( see , e.g. [ 8(b ) ] ) ,",
    "namely , that the former treats the hard cores in better fashion , seems strictly inconsequential .",
    "note also that the density - density correlation functions , @xmath63 , and also charge - charge correlation functions , @xmath64 , that satisfy the stillinger - lovett second - moment - condition follow from dh theory ( again contrary to [ 8(b ) ] ) when properly generalized @xcite .",
    "the pressure route to msa thermodynamics ( which we will denote mspa ) generates a different approximation for the electrostatic excess free energy , along with the percus - yevick - pressure - equation hard - core free energy .",
    "it is interesting that , like the ordinary energy - route msa thermodynamics , the mspa yields both a critical point and the exact dh limiting laws ; early on , however , waisman and lebowitz [ 11(c ) ] dismissed it as inferior .",
    "by contrast , the compressibility route yields _ no _ electrostatic contribution , but generates _ only _ the percus - yevick - compressibility - equation free energy for uncharged hard spheres ! finally , note that the thermodynamics of the generalized msa or gmsa ( which is designed so that all three routes to the thermodynamics agree ) @xcite is identical to the ordinary , energy - route msa combined with the carnahan - starling ( cs ) approximation for the pure hard - core free energy @xcite .",
    "since the rpm consists of hard spheres , it is certainly desirable to include an account of the excluded volume effects in any approximate theory .",
    "as we have seen , the two principal approximations , dh and msa , require the insertion of hard cores terms `` by hand , '' and two other theories , mspa and gmsa , entail two different hard - core approximations .",
    "for the sake of convenience and uniformity , then , we will employ the cs hard core approximation @xcite in the calculations reported here for _ all _ theories that recognize excluded volume effects .",
    "the corresponding theories will be denoted dhcs , msacs , and mspacs , while the notation dh , msa , and mspa will be reserved for the `` pure '' ( electrostatics only ) theories .",
    "we have , however , checked that other approximations for the pure hard - core contributions yield qualitatively similar results .",
    "it is worth mentioning that although hard - core terms do not contribute directly to the internal energy ( since their contribution to the energy of allowed configurations vanishes  as correctly reflected by the cs approximation ) , they _ do _ influence the overall internal energy picture .",
    "specifically , for the basic theories , as we shall see , they affect internal energy isotherms by altering the coexistence curve ; for the augmented , pairing theories , they enter by changing the degree of pairing .        for pure dh theory ( with neither pairing nor hard - core effects )",
    "the configurational energy assumes a particularly simple form , namely , @xmath65 evidently the energy of dh theory _ violates none of the bounds _ for any values of @xmath66 and @xmath53 : see ( [ eqkapx ] ) , ( [ eqonsag ] ) , and ( [ eqtot ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath67 remains above the crystal values ( [ eqxtal ] ) as is apparent in fig .",
    "1 . the contrary statements by blum and coworkers@xcite that @xmath67 violates onsager s bound perhaps mistake the debye - hckel limiting law ( dhll )  i.e. , truncation of dh theory to lowest order in @xmath68 , which no one should take seriously for @xmath69 : see fig . 1  for the full dh theory propounded in @xcite .    strictly , the dependence of @xmath67 on the single parameter @xmath68 given in ( [ equdh ] ) can be correct only in single - phase regions of the ( @xmath70 ) plane . below the critical temperature ( as defined by the theory at hand )",
    "the energy in the coexistence region is always a weighted sum of the values in the two phases , say @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , if the energies per particle are @xmath73 and @xmath74 and the densities @xmath75 and @xmath76 , one finds @xmath77 so that @xmath12 varies linearly with @xmath78 .",
    "thus the main dh plot in fig . 1",
    "is restricted to @xmath79 , and similarly for the other theories . however , including phase coexistence according to ( [ equcoex ] ) can not induce bound violation , since a weighted sum of two acceptable values also satisfies the bound : see the inset in fig . 1 where the solid curves depict dh isotherms for @xmath80 .",
    "=    regarding the effects of hard cores , one finds that the only changes in dhcs theory occur in the two - phase regions below @xmath81 : the energy isotherms are shifted from those of pure dh theory since the coexistence curve differs .",
    "the dashed curves in the inset to fig .",
    "1 show the rather small effects : the shifts mainly reflect the expected lowered densities on the liquid branch of the coexistence curve",
    ". naturally , these changes can not induce any violation of totsuji s bound or of the crystal limits .",
    "now blum and bernard @xcite have claimed the energy of the ( pure ) msa , is `` asymptotically correct . ''",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , the msa reduced excess energy , namely @xcite , @xmath82/x,\\ ] ] asymptotically approaches the onsager bound of @xmath83 but _ violates the totsuji bound _ for @xmath84 ( as totsuji noted originally @xcite ) . furthermore , @xmath85 lies below the crystal values for @xmath86 .",
    "in fact , even in the absence of totsuji s result , it is hard to make sense of the claim @xcite that the msa energy is asymptotically correct for the rpm in the limit of large @xmath68 by virtue of its approach to onsager s bound .",
    "agreement with a bound is hardly proof of correctness @xcite !",
    "furthermore , the limit @xmath87 at fixed density implies @xmath88 ; but at low temperatures , one expects crystalline phases to appear for @xmath89 ( for fcc sphere packing ) @xcite and these are not described by any of theories under consideration .",
    "it is worthwhile to interpret more explicitly the values @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where violation by the pure msa ( no hard cores ) occurs . on the liquid side of the coexistence curve",
    ", @xmath90 corresponds to violation when @xmath92 and @xmath91 corresponds to @xmath93 .",
    "( the first violation temperature here is estimated with the aid of a low - temperature asymptotic analysis of the pure msa coexistence curve @xcite while the second follows directly from a numerical evaluation . ) the solid curves in fig . 2",
    "demonstrate the effects .",
    "=    the inclusion of hard - core terms ( `` by hand '' ) in the pure msa changes the liquid - side coexistence curves more strongly than in dh theory .",
    "thus for the msa with cs terms or , equivalently , for the gmsa , the violations shift to much lower ratios of @xmath94 : this is clearly evidenced by the dashed coexistence isotherm shown in fig . 2 for @xmath95 ( with @xmath96 @xcite ) .",
    "the energy according to the mspa is @xcite @xmath97 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , in the single - phase region , also depends only on the parameter @xmath68 . as evident from fig .",
    "1 , however , this violates the totsuji and onsager bounds at @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "these results provide ample justification for a disparaging evaluation of the pressure - route thermodynamics for the msa . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", we thus omit the mspa .      in the pure theories ( in which bjerrum ion pairing is not explicitly included )",
    "we find that _ both _",
    "dh theory and the msa _ violate _ gillan s free energy upper bound .",
    "the entire vapor branches of both coexistence curves , as well as both sides of the dh critical region , are in violation . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the violations remain when hard - core excluded volume corrections are included .",
    "the dhcs and gmsa treatments exhibit very similar features , for the low densities of interest .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "3 we follow the coexistence prescription for the free energy corresponding to ( [ equcoex ] ) .",
    "note also that non - violation on one branch of the coexistence curve ( as on the gmsa liquid side ) is at best a qualified virtue since the construction of the coexistence curve depends on the free energies on _ both _ sides . in light of these results",
    "it is clearly imperative to examine theories which allow for ion pairing .",
    "to compensate for the effects of the dh linearization of the electrostatic boltzmann factor , bjerrum @xcite postulated association of `` free '' ions of ( residual ) density @xmath100 into `` bound '' neutral dipolar pairs of density @xmath101 so that the overall density is @xmath102 in terms of the ideal - gas free energy density @xmath103 $ ] with mean thermal de broglie wavelengths @xmath104 and internal partition functions @xmath105 @xcite , we may then write the total free energy density as @xcite @xmath106 with the excess free energy density @xmath107 where ( i ) @xmath108 denotes the pure hard - core / excluded - volume terms , ( ii ) @xmath109 represents the electrostatic contribution of the free ions , while ( iii ) @xmath110 denotes the dipole - ion interaction / solvation terms @xcite . as mentioned , we take here @xmath108 to be of carnahan - starling form @xcite with the dipoles treated as effective spheres of diameter @xmath111 @xcite .",

    "_ a concomitant depletion of free ions and their screening effects is a crucial element in the critical - region behavior of the rpm .",
    "gillan s bound also serves to highlight interesting contrasts between dh- and msa - based theories : the msa coexistence curve shifts only slightly when pairing is added ( msabj ) yet , surprisingly , violation of gillan s bound is still completely avoided ; the unphysical dhbj `` banana '' coexistence curve ( in fig .",
    "4 ) , on the other hand , immediately points to the significance of pairing , while satisfaction of gillan s bound is surprising here because the coexistence curve is so unconvincing .      testing the pairing theories against the bounds of totsuji and onsager yields mixed results . for a window of temperatures that includes the critical region , namely , @xmath165 , all the theories embodying ion association satisfy the energy bounds .",
    "we also find a surprising level of agreement among the various theories as to the value of the critical energy per particle : see table i. at low temperatures , however , some of the msa - based theories violate totsuji s bound .",
    "moreover , at moderate temperatures ( @xmath166 ) _ all _ of the pairing theories violate fundamental thermal stability requirements ( as discussed in the next section ) ; for some of the approximations , this is also accompanied by violation of the totsuji and onsager bounds , as explained below .",
    "now the energy for a general pairing theory follows from ( [ eqfbasic ] ) via the thermodynamic relation ( [ equdef ] ) and the mass action law ( [ eqmassaction ] ) , etc . , which leads to @xmath167 where @xmath168 is given by @xmath169 but this can be recognized simply as the mean energy of a _ single _ @xmath16 bound pair since the corresponding internal configurational partition function for a pair is embodied in the association constant , @xmath37  see the text above ( [ eqchempot ] ) and levin and fisher @xcite .",
    "of course , the factor @xmath170 in ( [ equwithpair ] ) is also to be determined via the law of mass action ( [ eqmassaction ] ) . for theories of the form ( [ eqfex ] ) ,",
    "one can further write @xmath171 where the `` basic '' expressions for the electrostatic contribution , @xmath172 , are now given by the natural generalizations of ( [ equdh ] ) and ( [ equmsa ] ) , namely , @xmath173 @xmath174/x_1 .\\ ] ] for reference , we also quote the explicit result for @xmath175 following from the treatment of fisher and levin in leading order @xcite . defining @xmath176 and @xmath177 as in ( [ eqfdi ] ) and ( [ eqdiomega ] ) @xcite",
    ", one finds @xmath178 } .\\ ] ] the corresponding expressions for the pmsa theories are omitted for the sake of brevity .",
    ".some critical - point parameters for various theories : @xmath17 ; @xmath179 , the reduced energy per particle ; @xmath180 , the ( overall ) debye parameter ; and , @xmath181 , the screening parameter .",
    "( note that the values quoted for @xmath182 in @xcite correspond here to @xmath183 and that the ebeling association constant @xcite was used throughout . ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]        for @xmath184 , evaluation of @xmath185 reveals violations of the totsuji bound for most of the msa theories .",
    "the reason turns out to be literally the same as for the pure msa : in the corresponding bj , bjcs , bjdi , and bjdics theories , as well as in the pmsa1 ( although _ not _ pmsa2 and 3 ) theory , the mass - action pairing predicted by ( [ eqmassaction ] ) becomes exponentially small as @xmath186 @xcite . as a result",
    ", all these theories revert to their ion - only form ( i.e. , msa or msacs ) and violations occur : see fig .",
    "1 . a similar depletion of pairs occurs when @xmath186 in the dhbjdi / cs ( but _ not _ dhbj / cs ) theories , and so these theories revert to the corresponding _ non - violating _",
    "dh / cs theories .",
    "these results are independent of whether one uses the ebeling or bjerrum association constant , or any other reasonable partition - function - like form , as discussed below .      in the temperature range @xmath187 , which includes @xmath17 , all the pairing theories described in the present study",
    "satisfy the totsuji bound , and hence onsager s as well .",
    "7 depicts energy isotherms for the pairing theories at @xmath188 .",
    "the plotted isotherms have been cut off for large @xmath62 at the hard - core packing limit , @xmath189 .",
    "fig . 7 also shows the location of the critical point of the dhbjdics theory , which may be regarded as a reference point in reading table i. the table lists the various critical energies and debye parameters . as mentioned , there is a fair measure of agreement among the different pairing theories regarding the energy at criticality even though other parameters vary quite strongly .",
    "violation of the energy bounds are found again , as mentioned above , at _ higher _ temperatures in the range @xmath166 , some 6 to 10 times greater than the estimates for @xmath17 .",
    "the reason for this surprising fact , however , is quite different from the cause at low temperatures : it transpires , indeed , that the form of the association constant is now crucially important .",
    "in fact , any theory with pairing governed by bjerrum s association constant violates both the totsuji and onsager bounds when @xmath190 and @xmath66 is large enough ! once noticed numerically , this behavior can be understood analytically by evaluating the factor @xmath168 in ( [ equwithpair ] ) using ( [ equ2 ] ) with @xmath191 . to that end recall , first , the well known fact @xcite that @xmath192 vanishes linearly , say as @xmath193 , when @xmath190 ( and remains identically zero for @xmath194 ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath168 diverges to @xmath195 like @xmath196 in this limit .",
    "however , the factor @xmath170 in ( [ equwithpair ] ) must be evaluated via the mass action law ( [ eqmassaction ] ) and is proportional to @xmath192 ; this gives @xmath197 as @xmath190 , so that @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "note that the @xmath200 , defined via ( [ eqchempot ] ) , depend on the theory under consideration .",
    "one finds that @xmath201 : this is large enough so that the pairing term ( [ equpairterm ] ) by itself yields a violation of onsager s bound when ( in dhbj theory ) @xmath202 or ( for msabj ) @xmath203 .",
    "however , as the other terms in ( [ equwithpair ] ) are also negative , violations must arise at even lower densities .",
    "one finds numerically , in fact , that the violations occur at or below @xmath204 in _ all _ the theories with pairing governed by bjerrum s association constant .",
    "one expects ebeling s choice , @xmath205 , which provides a match to the exact rpm second virial coefficient and never vanishes @xcite  in contrast to the singular vanishing of @xmath192 at @xmath206  to fare better . nevertheless , ebeling s association",
    "constant leads to onsager and totsuji bound violations in the region @xmath207  although only in those theories which explicitly allow for the excluded volume effects . the pmsa3 treatment , furthermore , falls into this same category of violation ; however , pmsa1 and 2 do _ not _ because the excluded - volume terms there do not affect the degree of pairing .        to pursue further the origins of the totsuji and onsager energy bound violations at @xmath166 , consider the energy isochores shown in fig .",
    "the two densities @xmath208 and @xmath163 have been chosen for display because they bracket the critical density ; similar behavior is seen at higher and lower densities . for the pure dh and msa theories , included in fig . 8 for reference purposes , @xmath185 rises monotonically with @xmath53 : this implies a positive constant - volume configurational specific heat , @xmath209 .",
    "( note that outside the two - phase region these two energy isochores are identical to those for dhcs and gmsa , respectively . )    now the positivity of the _ total _ constant - volume specific heat is a thermodynamic necessity dictated by the second law @xcite . for a classical particle system",
    ", however , the configurational contribution must be separately nonnegative : this follows _ either _ , thermodynamically , by regarding the kinetic and configurational degrees of freedom as thermally distinct systems _ or _ , from statistical mechanics , by expressing @xmath210 as a mean - square energy fluctuation which is necessarily positive at finite positive temperatures in any nontrivial system @xcite .      however , a quick perusal of fig .",
    "8 shows that _ all _ the pairing theory isochores  the solid and dashed curves representing dh- and msa - based theories , respectively , and the dot - dash plots for pmsa1 and 3  display regions where @xmath185 _ decreases _ as @xmath53 increases .",
    "in other words , all the paring theories predict negative constant - volume specific heats and violate the second law !",
    "the reason is not far to seek . in the limit of complete pairing",
    "( i.e. , @xmath211 ) all the approximate theories under consideration predict , via ( [ equwithpair ] ) , that the energy should be simply that of independent dipolar pairs : this corresponds to the plots labeled @xmath212 and @xmath213 in fig .",
    "8 which derive from ( [ equ2 ] ) and the bjerrum and ebeling forms for @xmath37 .",
    "but , as evident from the figure , both @xmath214 and @xmath215 exhibit pronounced maxima in the interval @xmath216 and then fall sharply as @xmath53 increases , dropping below @xmath217 at @xmath218 and @xmath219 , respectively .",
    "it is this behavior that leads to the decreasing regions in the overall excess energy isochores with incomplete pairing .",
    "but such a variation of @xmath168 is physically nonsensical since , clearly , the configurational energy @xmath220 of a bound pair can not fall below the contact value @xmath221 ( which , in turn , can be achieved in equilibrium only at @xmath222 ) .",
    "the problem with @xmath168 arises because the defining relation ( [ equ2 ] ) does not actually yield the physically anticipated thermodynamic mean value @xcite , say @xmath223 , which in the bjerrum picture of association would be @xmath224 with association constant @xmath225 the reason for the failure is simple : the bjerrum cutoff @xmath226 is taken to be temperature dependent @xcite , explicitly , @xmath227 for @xmath228 @xcite . in general , such temperature dependence leads to the difference @xmath229 which is negative whenever @xmath230 decreases as @xmath53 rises and which diverges when @xmath231 .",
    "the ebeling association constant can also be written in the form ( [ eqkoft ] ) but with the large-@xmath53 asymptotic form @xmath232 @xcite , which is quite accurate once @xmath233 .",
    "we must conclude that neither the ebeling nor the bjerrum association constants can be regarded as representing even an `` effective '' partition function for an isolated ion pair as is required by or implicitly assumed in the standard theories of association @xcite .    as suggested by fig .",
    "8 , the unphysically large values of @xmath168 lead to negative specific heats over large regions of the @xmath25 plane when either @xmath205 or @xmath192 is employed .",
    "fortunately for our primary focus on the critical region , the violations of thermal stability are confined in all cases to @xmath234 ( and for the pmsa theories to @xmath235 ) . at densities below @xmath236",
    "the pairing is sufficiently weak that the predicted @xmath237 always remains positive  although it does display an unphysical oscillation .",
    "once violations arise at a given @xmath53 , moreover , they persist to the highest densities .    of course , certain features are specific to the choice of association constant .",
    "as remarked earlier , @xmath192 `` switches off '' abruptly at @xmath238 where a nonphysical latent heat is implied for all @xmath239 ; above @xmath238 pairing is lost and no violations remain .",
    "when @xmath205 is used in dh- and msa - based theories with excluded - volume terms , violations remain at the highest temperatures .    what might be a cure for these pathologies ?",
    "it is clear from ( [ eqetwoav])-([equ2diff ] ) that the unphysical behavior of @xmath168 can be avoided if one fixes the cutoff in ( [ eqkoft ] ) at , say @xmath240 , so defining @xmath241 .",
    "furthermore , for any fixed @xmath242 , the @xmath243 behavior of @xmath241 still matches @xmath205 to all orders in @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the choice of @xmath244 may be optimized by requiring that the deviation @xmath245 remain less than a specified level up to as high a temperature as possible .",
    "thus one finds that @xmath246 provides 1% precision ( @xmath247 ) up to @xmath248 .",
    "one can then check that _",
    "none _ of the pairing theories employing @xmath249 with @xmath246 violates the energy bounds or thermal stability for any realizable thermodynamic state , @xmath25 . in addition , the qualitative conclusions regarding the violation and nonviolation of the gillan free energy bound remain unchanged .",
    "indeed , using @xmath250 causes only insignificant shifts of the free energy excess contours from those displayed in figs . 4 and 5 when @xmath251 .",
    "nevertheless , merely replacing @xmath205 by @xmath249 leads to significant inaccuracies in the thermodynamics at _ higher _ temperatures .",
    "thus a more thoughtful approach is essential to providing a reasonable approximate theory of the rpm that is valid over the full range of temperatures [ and up to moderate densities excluding , of course , the solid phase(s ) ] .",
    "such a treatment will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the second author is grateful for the stimulus provided for this work by professor joel l. lebowitz and by his attendance at the meeting organized by professor lesser blum at the university of puerto rico in march 1996 in honor of bernard jancovici .",
    "the interest of professors george stell and harold friedman is appreciated .",
    "the support of the national science foundation ( through grants che 93 - 11729 and che 96 - 14495 ) has been essential .",
