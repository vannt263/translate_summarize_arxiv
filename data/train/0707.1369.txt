    "the discovery that sunspots support oscillations ( e.g. , see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was important for it introduced the possibility of using measurements of phase - shifts in the propagating waves to probe the underlying structure and dynamics of these enigmatic objects .",
    "some of our current observational understanding of the sunspot interior comes from inverse theory applied in conjunction with time - distance helioseismology @xcite on waves in these regions .",
    "subsequent to the studies of flows in and around sunspots by @xcite , inversions utilizing the ray @xcite , rytov @xcite , and born @xcite approximations were performed to recover the interior structure of sunspots @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "many of these results have come into question because the analyses do not explicitly account for the influence of magnetic fields on wave travel times .",
    "apart from direct mechanical effects on the waves , magnetic fields are also responsible for impeding the action of near - surface convection , commonly believed to be the source of waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "despite the work of @xcite and @xcite , causal factors of travel - time shifts such as wave damping and source distribution inhomogeneity in the context of sunspots have not been studied in detail .",
    "@xcite first derived the linear sensitivity of @xmath4-mode travel times to local changes in source strength , later corroborated through time - distance analyses of artificial data by @xcite .",
    "the concept of variations in source - strength engendering travel - time shifts can be somewhat mystifying . surely waves do not speed up or slow down when a source emits a wave of half the amplitude , as the naive interpretation seems to indicate ?",
    "the answer lies in the manner in which travel times are computed ; stripped of physical interpretation , travel times are obtained by fitting cross correlations of velocity ( or intensity ) signals between pairs of points or a point and an annulus .",
    "the measurement points do not constitute a source - receiver pair as in the typical geophysical situation ; rather , all waves that contain coherent phase information at these points contribute to the cross correlations .",
    "the wave travel times measured in a system with a spatially uniform distribution of sources and a specific set of damping rates have certain expectation values .",
    "however , it is conceivable that over a region where the directionality or spatial distribution of waves is biased , the contributions by wave packets ( to the cross correlations ) from disparate directions and points are not in the same proportion as in the spatially uniform case . consequently , there is a shift in the expectation value of the travel time in this region . in fact , the term ` travel time ' is better interpreted as a quantity that describes the statistics of the wave field than the physical wave travel time between the measurement points .",
    "damping also plays an important role , for it determines the extent of coherence of the waves and the degree of contribution to the cross correlations",
    ". these can be serious issues in sunspots , because of the possible lack of sources and the putative excesses in damping and absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "mean travel times are defined as the average of the in- and outgoing wave travel times , while difference travel times are obtained by subtracting the two .",
    "we posit that the classical interpretation of mean travel - time shifts as mostly arising from changes in the sound speed and difference travel - time shifts predominantly from flows in sunspots is incomplete because the lack of wave sources can also cause significant mean and difference travel - time shifts ; this effect is demonstrated here via numerical simulations and semi - analytical methods . in @xmath5[forward.model ] , we describe the numerical machinery employed to perform the simulations and discuss the impact of horizontal boundary conditions on the resultant time shifts . in order to characterize the influence of damping rates , we apply the semi - analytical techniques of @xcite .",
    "we analyze the simulated data with methods of time - distance helioseismology in @xmath5[travel.times ] ; comparisons are drawn between the results of simulations and the semi - analytical models .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude in @xmath5[discussion ] .",
    "using techniques developed in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , wave propagation in the near - surface layers of the sun is simulated in a box of dimension @xmath6 , where the third dimension is depth .",
    "the background stratification is a convectively stabilized form of model s @xcite , described in appendix  [ alt.model ] .",
    "waves are stochastically excited by introducing a forcing term in the vertical momentum equation ; the forcing function is prescribed such that a solar - like power spectral distribution is obtained .",
    "the solution is temporally evolved using a second - order optimized runge - kutta integrator @xcite .",
    "the vertical derivative is resolved using sixth - order compact finite differences with fifth - order accurate boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "depending on the choice of boundary conditions , the derivatives in the horizontal directions are computed either using these compact finite differences ( absorbing conditions ) or the fast fourier transform ( periodic boundaries ) .",
    "the validation and verification of the code is discussed in appendix  [ verify ] .",
    "the power spectrum and snapshots of the oscillation velocities derived from a 12 hour long ` quiet ' simulation are displayed in figures  [ power.spec ] and  [ vels.profile ] respectively .",
    "to simulate source suppression , the forcing term is multiplied by a spatial function that mutes source activity in a circular region of 10 mm radius ( i.e. , the forcing function assumes a reduced value in this region ) .",
    "based on estimates of emitted energy flux in sunspot umbrae , which range from 10 - 20% of the average value in the quiet sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we perform two simulations , one with source strength in the disc region set to zero and another with 20% of the ` quiet ' value .",
    "the two simulations possess very similar travel - time maps ; therefore , we only show results from the simulation where the sources were completely suppressed .",
    "the power spectral distribution of oscillation modes and the steady - state wave flux emerge from an interplay between source activity , wave damping , and mode mass .",
    "the non - scattering nature of source - strength perturbations complicates matters because the phase measurements are sensitive to the degree of inhomogeneity , which in turn is dependent on the intensity of the ambient wave flux .",
    "one can imagine that in the limit of an arbitrarily large wave flux , the time - shift effects of the suppressed source may altogether vanish ( or reach some asymptotically small value ) .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate this matter in some detail .",
    "the wave flux in the computations is set by the choice of boundary conditions and damping rates .",
    "all other parameters being identical , absorbing horizontal sides evidently engender a weaker ambient flux than their periodic counterparts ; thus we may study the impact of boundary conditions on the time shifts through numerical experiments with these choices of horizontal boundaries . in an indirect manner , these boundary conditions mimic higher and lower damping rates . in the case of the former",
    ", the lack of incoming waves from regions external to the boundaries sets the damping length ( or maximum propagation distance ) to approximately half the size of the computational region , since the perturbation is always at the center .",
    "this results in a dearth of @xmath0 modes that travel large distances or those that possess long lifetimes .",
    "contrarily , in the case of periodic boundaries , waves exit from one boundary only to re - enter the domain from another ; if the modal damping rates are unrealistically small , these perpetually propagating acoustic waves will rapidly fill up the domain , thereby significantly diluting the effects arising from the suppressed sources .",
    "roughly we may conclude that the low wave damping limit is given by the periodic case and high damping limit by the absorbing case .",
    "unfortunately , due to poor observational constraints on damping rates , it is unclear as to which of these situations is preferable .",
    "the linewidths recovered from michelson doppler imager ( mdi * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observations by @xcite and @xcite differ by almost a factor of 2 .",
    "moreover , the complicated functional dependence of damping on frequency ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) makes it all but impossible to implement it in the computation .",
    "thus we can only hope to place bounds on the extent of the effect of suppressed sources since precise estimates are closely tied to the non - trivial feat of accurately matching the simulated wave power spectral distribution with the observational one .",
    "the outcomes of these tests are discussed in @xmath5[travel.times ] .      in order to gain an appreciation for the effects of damping on the conclusions of this paper , we create semi - analytical forward models in the manner of gizon & birch ( 2002 ) .",
    "these forward models predict the time shift associated with a specific perturbation .",
    "the starting point is the temporal fourier transform of equation  ( 22 ) from gizon & birch ( 2002 ) , which gives the expected value of the cross - covariance , @xmath7 , in terms of green s functions @xmath8 and the source covariance @xmath9 , @xmath10 the integration variable @xmath11 runs over the horizontal position of all the wave sources , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the positions of the two observation positions , and @xmath14 is the temporal frequency .",
    "notice that in writing this equation we have assumed that the wave sources are uncorrelated in space . in order to compute equation  ( [ eq.xcorr ] ) we use the normal - mode summation of green s functions from @xcite , which include two models of wave damping , one based on the line - widths measured by @xcite and the other with twice these rates ( approximately those measured by * ? ? ?",
    "we use the source covariance from @xcite , though modified to include the reduction of source strength inside the disc of radius 10  mm .",
    "it is important to note that the type of source used in this particular forward model is quadrupolar in nature , whereas we employ dipoles in the simulation . with these ingredients , the expected value of the point - to - point cross correlation ( eq .  [ [ eq.xcorr ] ] ) can then be computed numerically and averaged to obtain center - to - annulus cross correlations . in @xmath5[travel.times ] , we shall further discuss the connection between the horizontal boundary conditions implemented in the simulations and the damping rates incorporated in this theory .",
    "the @xmath0-mode travel times are measured using the procedure described in @xcite . in order to estimate the travel times accurately ,",
    "broad phase - speed filters were implemented to avoid contaminating the first bounce ridge with the filter artifact ( see table 1 of @xcite ; the fwhm was multiplied by 4 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-mode cross - correlation branches corresponding to positive and negative times ( outgoing / ingoing waves ) averaged over the source - perturbation area in comparison to the average cross correlation for the quiet simulation with absorbing horizontal sides are shown in figure  [ cross_corr ] for @xmath15 mm , where @xmath16 is the distance between measurement points .",
    "there is a noticeable asymmetry between the outgoing and ingoing waves , especially at larger distances where the outgoing waves contain almost all of the travel - time shift .",
    "choosing the center of the source suppression to be the zero point , ingoing and outgoing travel - time shifts are azimuthally averaged and plotted in figure  [ pmode_distances ] .",
    "the reduction in the @xmath0-mode mean travel times seen in panel a of figure  [ pmode_distances ] is comparable , magnitude - wise , to the 15 s increase ( azimuthal average ) seen for @xmath17 mm in some sunspots ( noaa 8243 , from high - resolution mdi observations , * ? ? ?",
    "the asymmetry between in and outgoing waves for the travel distance of @xmath15 mm results in significant shifts in the difference times , of the order of 12 s ( panel b , figure  [ pmode_distances ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the simulations with periodic boundary conditions show reduced shifts ( also see * ? ? ? * ) , of the order of 10 s in the mean times for @xmath18 mm and 6 s in the difference times for @xmath19 mm .",
    "evidently , the reappearance of waves from the opposite boundary upon their exit from one has led to the prevalence of a larger wave flux in the computational domain . as pointed out in @xmath5[forward.model ] , the wave flux plays a crucial role in bounding the effect of non - scattering source perturbations .",
    "the situation is rendered interesting by the close correspondence between the theory of @xmath5[theoretical.model ] and the simulations , as seen between the upper and lower pairs of rows in figure  [ pmode_distances ] .",
    "higher damping rates lead to larger time shifts and vice versa , analogous to simulations with the absorbing and periodic boundaries respectively .",
    "the conflicting linewidth estimates of @xcite and @xcite make it difficult to conclusively pick one simulation over the other .",
    "in fact , it is probably fair to say that realistic magnitudes of the time shifts lie somewhere between the estimates derived from the absorbing and periodic cases .",
    "if the simulations are believed to be representative of reality , and the travel times of in- and outgoing waves are appropriately ` corrected ' to account for the possibility of missing wave sources in sunspots , we might expect a significant change in the mean travel times for @xmath18 mm .",
    "moreover , the asymmetry between the in / outgoing waves seen for @xmath20 mm ( ingoing @xmath2 -10 s , outgoing @xmath2 -40 s , azimuthal averages for sunspot noaa 8243 ) could be reduced somewhat by applying these corrections .",
    "we show in figure  [ linearity ] that travel - time shifts associated with source suppression and sound - speed perturbations are linearly additive . thus these source suppression effects can be addressed in a linear manner , making it possible to remove their signature from helioseismic analyses .",
    "the decrease of acoustic power in a sunspot has been widely observed and explanations offered ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; recently , @xcite have suggested that the suppression of convection ( and hence wave sources ) is sufficient to explain more than half of the decrease in acoustic power in sunspots .",
    "however , in our calculations , even when the source strengths in the region of suppression are reduced to zero , we see only about 20% reduction in acoustic power . in any case",
    ", it is difficult to compare these two results because of the differences in damping rates , the time length of the calculations , the sizes of the computational domains , etc . to compensate for travel - time measurement ` errors ' related to the local reduction in acoustic power , @xcite proposed a power correction method which we incorporated before computing travel times .",
    "since we use broad phase - speed filters and because the acoustic power is reduced by only 20% , the power correction does little in the way of altering time shifts ( @xmath2 10 % change at the most ) in our simulations .",
    "inversions of the mean time shifts ( absorbing boundary case ) using sound - speed kernels in the ray approximation and the multi - channel deconvolution algorithm @xcite are shown in figure  [ inversion ] .",
    "the perturbation appears as a shallow ( @xmath21 1.5 mm , abutting the photosphere ) , 7.5 % increase in @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the sound speed .",
    "the horizontal size of the anomaly is comparable to that of the region of suppressed sources , i.e. about 20 mm .",
    "we demonstrate that obtaining meaningful travel times is strongly incumbent upon the homogeneity of sources in the medium .",
    "numerical and analytical experiments where sources sources were suppressed over a region typically the horizontal size of a sunspot predict significant wave phase shifts",
    ". therefore , our analysis seems to indicate that helioseismic investigations into the internal constitution of a sunspot are incomplete without taking into account the effects of inhomogeneously distributed sources and damping @xcite .",
    "we see that in- and outgoing waves are differentially affected , with the asymmetry exacerbated at increasing travel distance , @xmath24 , especially when damping rates are high .",
    "the large negative mean travel - time shifts seen at the shortest travel distances ( @xmath2 -10 @xmath25 -15 s , @xmath18 mm ) are worrisome for it is not clear how accurate estimates are of the amplitude of the near - surface sound - speed perturbation below a sunspot .",
    "similarly , the systematic difference travel times observed for waves ( also @xmath2 -6 @xmath25 -15 s , @xmath15 mm ) that travel larger distances indicates that the flow inversions may be inaccurate .",
    "the power correction of @xcite in this case decreases the magnitude of the travel - time shifts at most by about @xmath26 .",
    "the sensitivities of other methods of helioseismology like ring diagram analysis @xcite and acoustic holography @xcite to the homogeneity of the wave field remain to be investigated .",
    "the upshot of these calculations is that the methods of @xcite and @xcite can be applied to infer and model out to a large extent the measurement biases introduced by the suppressed sources .",
    "moreover , numerical forward models of the solar wave field have become increasingly sophisticated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , presenting ways to test inversion results .",
    "here , we describe the artificially convectively stabilized model ( appendix a of * ? ? ?",

    "the agreement is good .",
    "the accuracy of the numerical scheme described in @xmath5[forward.model ] is confirmed using a number of tests @xcite . before delving into the verification details , it is important to understand the parameter regimes of the waves and the limiting factors controlling the simulation timestep",
    ". the highest frequency of waves of interest to us is of the order of 6 mhz , corresponding to a timescale of about 167 seconds .",
    "the simulation timestep of 2 seconds is significantly smaller than the period of the oscillations .",
    "the calculations are evidently temporally highly over resolved ; compared to the 4 - 10 points per wavelength ( ppw ) quoted by @xcite and @xcite , the simulations operate at between 80 - 250 ppw . in the radial direction ,",
    "the eigenfunctions of the modes contain a rather small number of nodes ( 10 - 30 depending on the mode ) in comparison to the actual number of grid points ( 300 points ) .",
    "the reason for the excessive spatial resolution is the need to capture the rapid density ( pressure ) variation with radius .",
    "therefore , the limiting factor controlling the timestep is the large number of density ( pressure ) scale heights in the computational domain , which is why the radial and temporal resolutions are so high .",
    "we show in figure  [ crude.conv ] that the boundary conditions cause the error convergence rate of the compact finite differences to drop to fifth order .",
    "although not presented here , the convergence rate is entirely unchanged when the radial de - aliasing filter , described in @xcite , is applied in conjunction with the finite differences .",
    "next , to demonstrate the accuracy of the spatial scheme in its entirety ( i.e. , when used with radial de - aliasing and the temporal scheme ) , we simulate the 1-d propagation of a gaussian wavelet in a box with reflecting boundary conditions .",
    "the grid - spacing in the calculation follows the constant travel - time criterion developed in @xcite .",
    "the background model is chosen to be an adiabatically stratified , truncated polytrope with index @xmath43 , gravity @xmath44 , reference pressure @xmath45 and reference density @xmath46 , such that the pressure and density variations are given by ,      and @xmath48 the photospheric level of the background model is at @xmath49 , with the upper boundary of the truncated polytrope placed at a depth of @xmath50 .",
    "this model is similar to the stratification in the outer layers of the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . because error convergence rates are very sensitive and easily masked by slight differences such as the locations of the comparison points of solutions , we start with a highly resolved 721 point grid and downsample by successively higher rates ( every second point , every third point , and so on ) . the solutions obtained on this sequence of grids are compared with the highly resolved case to obtain the error convergence rate .",
    "the lower boundary of the simulation is placed at @xmath51 mm , with wall - like boundary conditions on both ends ( @xmath52 , at the boundaries ) .",
    "the timestep of the simulation was chosen to be @xmath53 seconds .",
    "the experiment is graphically displayed in figure  [ experiment ] and the error convergence rate is shown in figure  [ space.conv ] .",
    "min is displayed .",
    "simulations are performed with varying numbers of grid points , @xmath54 and 121 , so that each grid is a downsampled version ( i.e. , every other point , every third point etc . ) of the @xmath55 case .",
    "errors are computed at @xmath56 min using a downsampled version of the @xmath57 min solution as a template ( panel b ) . in panels ( c ) and",
    "( d ) , the differences between the @xmath58 solution and the downsampled @xmath55 template at @xmath59 min are displayed .",
    "the wavelet has propagated all the way out to the upper boundary at this point ; it is seen that the difference , interpreted as the error , is greater in the unfiltered case in panel ( d ) than in the filtered version in panel ( c ) , where the filter is applied to dealias variables in the radial direction @xcite .",

    "the solid line is the error of the compact finite differences and the dashed line is a theoretical sixth - order accuracy curve .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that the scheme obeys a sixth - order accuracy law despite the use of fifth - order boundary conditions .",
    "partly , the reason could be that the problem is a consistent initial - boundary value problem , i.e. @xmath60 and @xmath61 at the boundaries . ]      for the polytrope described above , it is possible to determine the eigenfunctions analytically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this will assist us in verifying that the spatial scheme is able to recover the eigenfunctions accurately .",
    "the first step is to set down the equations to be solved : @xmath62 where @xmath63 refers to density , @xmath23 refers to sound speed , the 0 subscript refers to background properties of the model , and @xmath64 time .",

    "<S> wave travel - time shifts in the vicinity of sunspots are typically interpreted as arising predominantly from magnetic fields , flows , and local changes in sound speed . </S>",
    "<S> we show here that the suppression of granulation related wave sources in a sunspot can also contribute significantly to these travel - time shifts , and in some cases , an asymmetry between in and outgoing wave travel times . the tight connection between the physical interpretation of travel times and source - distribution homogeneity is confirmed . </S>",
    "<S> statistically significant travel - time shifts are recovered upon numerically simulating wave propagation in the presence of a localized decrease in source strength . </S>",
