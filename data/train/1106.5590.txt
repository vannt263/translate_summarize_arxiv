    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite has been intensively studied and fruitfully extended to various directions over a decade . however , a complete proof of this conjecture is still missing even for the most typical example , the correspondence between @xmath0 super yang - mills theory ( sym ) and type iib superstring theory on @xmath10 . this is partially because the correspondence is a strong / weak one .",
    "namely , the region on the string theory side in which the supergravity approximation or the classical string approximation is valid is mapped to the strongly coupled region in the planar limit on the gauge theory side . in order to study @xmath0 sym in the strongly coupled region , one needs to have a non - perturbative formulation such as the lattice gauge theory .",
    "in fact , there are considerable developments in the lattice theories of @xmath0 sym @xcite .",
    "however , any lattice formulations of @xmath0 sym proposed so far seem to require the fine - tuning of at least three parameters .    in @xcite , a non - perturbative formulation of @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 in the planar ( t hooft ) limit was proposed by using the plane wave matrix model ( pwmm ) @xcite ( for earlier discussions , see @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xmath0 sym on @xmath11 at a conformal point has the @xmath12 symmetry with thirty - two supercharges and is equivalent to @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 through the conformal mapping .",
    "the pwmm can be obtained by dimensionally reducing @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 over @xmath3 @xcite . in the formulation , @xmath0 sym on @xmath1",
    "is retrieved by taking an appropriate large-@xmath2 limit for the theory around a particular vacuum of the pwmm .",
    "thus the formulation is viewed as an extension of the large-@xmath2 reduction @xcite , which asserts that the planar limit of a gauge theory is described by its dimensionally reduced model .",
    "the formulation provides a matrix regularization of the planar @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 , where the matrix size plays a role of the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "remarkably , the formulation preserves sixteen supercharges and the gauge symmetry .",
    "note that this number of the preserved supercharges is optimal , because any regularization must break the conformal symmetry so that the number is inevitably reduced to less than or equal to sixteen from thirty - two .",
    "since the formulation preserves so many supercharges and provides a massive theory , no fine - tuning should be needed in taking the continuum limit .",
    "this is advantageous to the lattice formulations of @xmath0 sym , while the latter may also be used to study the finite @xmath2 @xmath0 sym .",
    "thus the formulation gives a feasible way to simulate the planar @xmath0 sym by computer using the methods in @xcite and study its strong coupling dynamics sym and comparison of the results with the prediction from the gravity side will be reported in @xcite .",
    "preliminary results including the one for the wilson loop are seen in @xcite . for related work , see @xcite . ] .    to check the validity of the formulation ,",
    "some one - loop perturbative calculations were performed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the tadpole vanishes and that the fermion one - loop self - energy agrees with the one in the continuum theory . in @xcite ,",
    "the known result of the confinement - deconfinement transition in the planar @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 in the weak coupling limit at finite temperature was reproduced in the formulation . in @xcite , a two - loop calculation in the high temperature limit",
    "was done , and the result was consistent with the continuum theory . in @xcite , based on the earlier work @xcite , the same large-@xmath2 reduction for @xmath3 was applied to chern - simons theory on @xmath3 to obtain a matrix regularization of the theory in the planar limit , and the exact results on chern - simons theory on @xmath3 were reproduced .",
    "extension of the formulation to other supersymmetric gauge theories was discussed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "large-@xmath2 reduction on general group manifolds and coset spaces was found . applying the case of @xmath13",
    "to planar @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 yields another non - perturbative formulation of the theory in terms of the pwmm .",
    "recently , a matrix model regularization of @xmath0 sym on @xmath14 was proposed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we make a further check by calculating two quantities : the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a half - bps wilson loop and the beta function .",
    "erickson , semenoff and zarembo gave a successful example of calculation in the strongly coupled regime of @xmath0 sym @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they considered ( locally ) supersymmetric wilson loops in @xmath0 sym on @xmath11 .",
    "it is conjectured that the logarithms of the vev of such a wilson loop in @xmath0 sym corresponds to minus the area of the minimal surface of a string world sheet in the @xmath10 such that the boundary of the world sheet coincides with the loop @xcite . in the planar limit",
    ", they evaluated the vev of the circular wilson loop , which is half - bps , by summing up all ladder diagrams of all orders in the perturbative expansion .",
    "they indeed showed that in the strong coupling region the result agrees with the prediction on the gravity side @xcite .",
    "thus , they gave a nontrivial check of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "their result was reproduced through the localization method in @xcite to show that it is indeed the exact result . in this paper",
    ", we reproduce their result in the above formulation of @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 .",
    "we first construct an operator in terms of the matrices in such a way that it coincides with the wilson loop in @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 in the continuum limit .",
    "then , we concentrate on the circular loop , and calculate its vev by summing up all the planar ladder diagrams .",
    "we find that the vev exactly agrees with the result in @xcite .",
    "we also evaluate the 1-loop beta function and find that it indeed vanishes , which is consistent with restoration of the superconformal invariance .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the non - perturbative formulation of the planar @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 proposed in @xcite . in section 3 , after reviewing wilson loops in the ads / cft correspondence , we construct operators in the non - perturbative formulation which correspond to the wilson loops in @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 in the continuum limit . in section 4",
    ", we calculate the vev of the operator in the half - bps case and show that it agrees with the known exact result . in section 5 , we calculate the 1-loop beta function and verify that it indeed vanishes . section 6 is devoted to summary and discussion . in appendices ,",
    "some details are gathered .",
    "in this section , we review the novel large-@xmath2 reduction for @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 proposed in @xcite . in section 2.1 , as a warm - up , we review the large-@xmath2 reduction on @xmath15 developed in @xcite , by taking the @xmath16 theory on @xmath15 as an example . in section 2.2 , to explain the mechanism of the large-@xmath2 reduction on @xmath3 , we consider the large @xmath2 reduction for the @xmath16 theory on @xmath3 . in section 2.3 , we apply the mechanism to @xmath0 sym on @xmath1 .",
