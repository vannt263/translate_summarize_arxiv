    "later experiments were performed with @xmath13 or 180@xmath14 .",
    "this allowed further separation of the cross section and determination of @xmath12 , @xmath9 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "spectroscopic factors are then determined from these measurements by assuming a model in which the @xmath17n states are pure @xmath18 or @xmath19 coupled to an outgoing proton and observing by what fraction the calculated response functions must be reduced to match the experimental values .",
    "one would assume that the same reduction factor should apply to each response function .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , which reported on an experiment centered at @xmath4 = ( 460 mev / c , 100 mev ) , calculations were performed with a model that gave a proper account of previous data taken in parallel kinematics .",
    "they found an enhancement factor for @xmath9 for the residual @xmath18 state differed by a factor of one and one - half and that for the @xmath19 state differed by more that a factor of two from factors required for the other response functions .",

    "these terms were calculated within a continuum rpa model . with reduction factors of 0.60 @xmath18 and 0.51 @xmath19 applied to the calculated response functions with exchange currents , the discrepancy among responses",
    "was mostly removed , although the resulting shapes as a function of missing momentum were not that good .",

    "they find considerable sensitivity to the models , but in all cases the total contribution of mec to @xmath9 is far too small to eliminate the discrepancy between @xmath9 and the other structure functions .",
    "the resulting agreement with the data is unsatisfactory .",
    "it should be noted that the results of ref .",

    "orthogonality between bound and scattering states is guaranteed .",
    "the input to the rccsm consists of only an oscillator size parameter , @xmath21 , the desired states of the @xmath22 core nuclei ( labeled by @xmath23 ) , and a realistic , translationally invariant interaction . an oscillator constant of @xmath24 = 0.3068 @xmath25 is employed in this work .",
    "the results show little variation with respect to reasonable @xmath26-shell values of the constant .",

    "one could ignore the continuity equation and just calculate the longitudinal current with the above equation and use that result in the cross section calculation . or one could choose not to calculate the longitudinal current and replace it with @xmath124 in the spirit of siegert s theorem @xcite , assuming one has a better knowledge of the nuclear density than the current .",
    "alternatively , one could replace @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the two choices correspond to two different choices of gauge for the virtual photon propagator .",
    "in fact ref .",
    "@xcite investigates three different gauges and demonstrates that for non - conserved currents , different gauges produce different cross sections .",
    "one can build current conservation into the longitudinal current operator ; or is it more honest to calculate it directly and say this is what the model produces ? some incite into this question is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where calculations for bound state excitations are performed with different choices for the current and in limited and extended model spaces .",
    "the authors found that different choices for the current produced different cross sections , but the differences were much smaller when the model space was extended .",
    "in addition , one transverse electric operator with current conservation built into it @xcite , gave similar results to both the limited and extended model spaces .",
    "this result provides some evidence that invoking current conservation in some form is preferable to calculating the longitudinal current operator matrix elements .",

    ".    one can test the degree of current conservation violation by comparing matrix elements of @xmath124 with those of @xmath127 .",

    "that is , does the attempt to include relativistic effects render current more or less conserved ?",

    "the open circles correspond to calculations without the direct pauli reduction terms ; the crosses correspond to those with the terms .",
    "the arrows indicate the approximate position of the quasi - elastic peak .",
    "a slightly smaller ratio at the quasi - elastic peak , indicating slightly more current conservation violation is found with the inclusion .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the artificially constructed wave function is further from the exact solution to the model hamiltonian .",
    "however , since the differences are small near the quasi - elastic peak , the use of the direct pauli reduction does not have a serious effect on current conservation .",
    "calculations were performed for @xmath0o@xmath132n@xmath133 with the rccsm to determine the effect of mec and relativistic corrections on cross sections and response functions . of special concern was the inability of optical model calculations to reproduce the interference response , @xmath33 .",
    "two previous calculations came to opposite conclusions as to whether mec could substantially increase @xmath33 and hence , provide some consistency among spectroscopic factors extracted from individual cross sections and response functions .",
    "inclusion of mec of ref .",
    "@xcite in the rccsm produced results very much like those of ref .",
    "@xcite , and led to the same conclusion - that mec do not make a substantial contribution to producing consistency .",
    "therefore , the effect of relativistic corrections was tested by including direct pauli reduction terms in the rccsm .",
    "these terms contributed substantially to the response functions and provided reasonable consistency for spectroscopic factors .",
    "a reduction factor of 0.81 , applied to all @xmath95 calculations , at @xmath4 = ( 460 mev / c , 100 mev ) , and @xmath4 = ( 570 mev / c , 172 mev ) provided a good fit to all cross sections and response functions .",
    "calculations for the p3/2 showed similar consistency for the data at @xmath4 = ( 460 mev / c , 100 mev ) data with a reduction factor of 0.71 , but required a reduction factor of 0.60 to provided consistency between @xmath33 and the cross section for the @xmath4 = ( 570 mev / c , 172 mev ) data .",
    "a test of currents conservation showed that inclusion of direct pauli reduction terms increased the violation only slightly and is , therefore , an appropriate procedure .",
    "the importance of a coupled channels model was demonstrated by performing calculations that eliminate contributions from channels other than the exit channel .",
