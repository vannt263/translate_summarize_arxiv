    "the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath6 of the muon is one of the most precisely determined quantities in particle physics .",
    "experimental efforts at brookhaven and theoretical efforts of the past ten years have pinned @xmath7 down to the @xmath8 level , leading to significant deviations between theory @xcite and experiment @xcite of @xmath9 : @xmath10 this discrepancy makes @xmath7 very interesting since it might be taken as a hint towards physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in order to confirm this hypothesis the uncertainties of both theory and experiment have to be reduced even further .",
    "the theoretical error is dominated by hadronic contributions , _",
    "e.g _ diagrams that involve qcd beyond perturbation theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the leading qcd contribution is given by the hadronic vacuum polarisation ( hvp ) insertion shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hadroniclo ] ( left ) .",
    "this diagram also dominates the present error of the sm prediction .",
    "however , since the hvp can be related to experimental data from measurements of @xmath11 hadrons , a systematic reduction of the uncertainty will come with improved experimental input .    when this is realised , another contribution will dominate the theoretical error .",
    "this is the hadronic light - by - light ( lbl ) scattering shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hadroniclo ] ( right ) . for",
    "this contribution one must rely entirely on theory since no direct experimental constraints are available .",
    "this contribution involves the hadronic photon four - point function which is the central object in the following considerations .",
    "this green s function has been the subject of intensive investigation in the past , mainly from the perspective of large-@xmath12 and chiral effective theory .",
    "these suggest an ordering of diagrams that serve as an approximation towards the full function @xcite .",
    "the diagrams have been calculated in the extended nambu  jona - lasinio model ( enjl ) @xcite and the hidden local symmetry model ( hls ) @xcite .",
    "later a refined analysis of the potentially leading @xmath13 exchange contribution based on ideas of vector meson dominance ( vmd ) has been started @xcite .",
    "therein , the off - shell behaviour of the @xmath14 transition form factor was considered .",
    "recently , an analysis of lbl within the non local chiral quark model ( nl@xmath15qm ) has been presented @xcite .",
    "+ the hadronic lbl contribution to @xmath7 involves a two - fold integration of the four point function ( fig . [",
    "fig : hadroniclo ] ( right ) ) which makes it a two - scale problem .",
    "thus a separation of hard and soft scales is in general not straightforward .",
    "we circumvent the process of matching an ultraviolet ( uv ) description in terms of perturbative quarks and gluons and effective mesonic degrees of freedom in the infrared ( ir ) by choosing a description that is entirely based on the fundamental degrees of freedom of qcd , quarks and gluons . in this non - perturbative approach ,",
    "bound - states arise dynamically .",
    "we rely on the dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) which provide a non - perturbative means to obtain full one particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) green s functions  @xcite .",
    "in particular we work in a truncation scheme defined in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see the next section ) .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite and extensions beyond this truncation can be found in  @xcite .    in the present model the photon four point function",
    "may be defined as a resummation of an infinite subset of the leading order @xmath16 diagrams .",
    "in particular only planar diagrams without internal quark lines are considered .",
    "additionally , the yang - mills sector of qcd is truncated to two - point functions so that only rainbow - ladder gluon insertions are taken into account .",

    "it is well known that the second diagram of this expansion includes various resonances and in particular pseudo - scalar mesons .",

    "this leads us to a picture that includes meson exchange terms in analogy to the @xmath16 picture . while an evaluation of eq .",

    "( [ fig : photon4pt ] ) as a starting point of our investigations .",
    "in the following we summarize our calculational scheme for lbl ; details will be given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the three objects that we must calculate are the fully dressed quark propagator ( fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkdse ] ) , the bethe - salpeter - amplitude ( bsa , fig .  [ fig : bse ] ) for pseudo - scalar ( ps ) mesons and the quark - photon - vertex ( fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkphotondse ] ) .",
    "these are defined via self - consistent integral equations that require numerical solution .",
    "the gluon ( @xmath18 ) and quark - gluon vertex are needed to solve the quark dse of fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkdse ] . in our truncation",
    "the vertex is considered to be projected onto one component @xmath19 giving the interaction @xmath20{rlkernel.eps } }    & =   \\gamma_\\mu d_{\\mu\\nu}(k^2 ) \\gamma^{ym}(k^2)\\gamma_\\nu .",
    "\\label{eqn : rlkernel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dressing @xmath21 of the landau gauge gluon @xmath22 is combined with the vertex dressing @xmath23 and modeled by a single dressing function that approaches one loop perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) in the uv and contains a strongly enhanced ir part that induces dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath15sb ) @xcite .",
    "the resultant quark contains pqcd above a few gev and develops an enhanced mass function of typically a few hundred mev in the ir . in this way",
    "perturbation theory is unified with the constituent quark picture with the quark defined at all momentum scales .",
    "once the quark - dse is solved , the quark , together with ( [ eqn : rlkernel ] ) , forms an integral part of the remaining two equations for the three - point functions ( figs .",
    "[ fig : bse ] and [ fig : quarkphotondse ] ) .",
    "this truncation respects the chiral properties of qcd such that low energy theorems like the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation @xcite are fulfilled . in this way",
    "observables such as bound - state masses , leptonic decay constant and form factors in the pseudo - goldstone octet are reproduced on the percent level while the accuracy is five to ten percent for vector mesons @xcite .",
    "these channels are the most important ones in the present calculation .",
    "these building blocks now allow for a description of qcd bound - states as solutions of the bse ( fig.[fig : bse ] ) , together with electromagnetic properties which are dependent on the quark - photon - vertex ( fig.[fig : quarkphotondse ] ) that couples qcd to qed .",
    "we emphasize that the self - consistent quark - photon - vertex contains a dynamically generated vector - meson bound state pole in the time - like region thus encapsulating the ideas of vector meson dominance ( vmd ) .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "consider as an example the @xmath24 transition form factor , shown in impulse approximation in fig .",
    "[ fig : quarktriangle ] .",
    "this description fulfills the most important constraints for the case of the pion , such the charge conservation in the correct asymptotic limits for high photon virtualities .",
    "more information about the properties of this form factor can be found in @xcite . in the present case , however , the pion is far away from its mass - shell and thus an off - shell prescription is necessary ( see @xcite for details ) .    with the quark , quark - photon vertex and @xmath25 specified we now have all of the ingredients necessary to calculate the photon four - point function and its expansion depicted in eq .",
    "( [ fig : photon4pt ] ) .",
    "the @xmath26 exchange contributions amount to @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 leading to @xmath30 the errors include numerical uncertainties as well as estimates of the model dependence .",
    "the latter is determined by consideration of meson observables in the respective channels . the result given in eq .",
    "( [ res : ps ] ) compares well to previously obtained values  @xcite .    due to numerical complexity",
    ", our results for the quark loop contribution do not yet include the full quark - photon vertex ( fig .",
    "[ fig : photon4pt_2 ] ) . instead we quote here results which include ( a ) bare vertices and ( b ) the leading part of the ball - chiu construction ( 1bc )  @xcite : @xmath31 the result for bare vertices in eq .",
    "( [ res : ql ] ) is comparable to that found in constituent quark models .",
    "the 1bc vertex strongly enhances the contribution to the muon anomaly .",
    "this is in stark contrast to what has been found in other models @xcite .",
    "the difference of the two results in eq .",
    "( [ res : ql ] ) determines the leading error quoted above .",
    "the inclusion of all non - perturbative covariant of the quark - photon vertex is desirable , but is an extremely elaborate calculation and deferred to future work . at face value",
    ", this then leads to a revised estimate of the total @xmath4 , which reduces the difference between theory and experiment to @xmath32 .",
