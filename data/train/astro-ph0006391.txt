    "ll    &    we assume a 1d geometry and we suppose the shock to be located in @xmath0 .",
    "this will be insured by imposing that the flow velocity possesses an inflection point in @xmath0 that is ( noting @xmath1 the flow velocity ) : @xmath2 . we suppose the spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath3 to be independent of @xmath4 and of the energy of the particles and we assume the plasma pressure @xmath5 to be dominated by the pressure @xmath6 of the relativistic leptons population .",
    "the shock still exists as long as eq . ( 1 ) ( which depends on the pair pressure creation rate @xmath7 and on the size of the pair creation region @xmath8 cf .",
    "1 ) is verified .",
    "it appears that , for a given value of @xmath8 , there exists a limit value @xmath9 of @xmath7 above which eq .",
    "( 1 ) has no consistent solutions anymore and the shock disappears .",
    "as seen before , for pair pressure creation rate larger than @xmath9 the shock disappears . however , with the corresponding fall down of the acceleration processes , the rate of pair creation , and consequently the pair pressure creation rate , decreases and the shock may appear again , initiating pair processes until a new destruction of the shock .",
    "these cycles shock appearance / disappearance could thus be the origin of the high energy variability observed in agns ( and perhaps in prompt @xmath10-ray bursts where the compactness may be large enough ) .",
    "if the pair pressure modifies the flow velocity profile , reversely a change of the flow velocity profile can modify the distribution function of the accelerated particles in such a way that the number of particles enable to trigger the pair creation process ( i.e. particles with @xmath11 ) may change , modifying consequently the pair creation rate .",
    "stationary states are then obtained by solving self - consistently for the particle distribution function @xmath12 and the flow velocity profile @xmath1 , linked through the pair pressure creation rate .",
    "we have reported on fig .",
    "2 the contour plots of the spectral index and high energy cut - off of the high energy spectra produced by ic for stationary states characterized by different values of the soft compactness and the upstream flow velocity ."
