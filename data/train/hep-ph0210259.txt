    "the search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) can be pursued in two distinct ways : by observing the direct production of particles associated with this new physics , or by detecting the indirect influence of these new states on precision measurements . since the discovery of the top quark in the early 1990s , no new elementary particle has been found .",
    "however , many indirect constraints on the sm and its possible extensions have been obtained by experiment .",
    "for example , high precision measurements on the @xmath4-pole at lep , combined with the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 measured at the tevatron , have constrained the mass of the sm higgs boson to satisfy the bound @xmath7 gev at 95% cl by studying its influence on the radiative corrections to @xmath8 decays  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the parameter space available to supersymmetric theories is becoming restricted by the absence of cp - violating electric dipole moments which are required in supersymmetric models to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe via electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "there are currently several quantities whose measured values do not match their sm predictions .",
    "the value of the muon @xmath9  @xcite , @xmath10 as derived from the low energy neutrino - nucleon scattering experiment nutev  @xcite , and the magnitude of atomic parity violation ( apv ) in the cesium atom  @xcite have all been recently reported to deviate from their sm prediction by @xmath11 .",
    "the interpretation of these discrepancies , however , is rendered difficult by our current inability to reliably calculate the required hadronic or atomic physics that affects these quantities .",
    "the deviations discussed above have been argued to either be less significant or to vanish altogether when the relevant contributions are more carefully analyzed  @xcite .",
    "these results increase the importance of e-158 , a fixed target @xmath2 experiment currently being performed at slac  @xcite .",
    "this experiment will determine @xmath12 at a momentum transfer @xmath13 , comparable to the value relevant for neutrino - nucleon scattering , by measuring the polarization asymmetry @xmath14 in the scattering process @xmath15 ; this reaction is less sensitive to the hadronic physics that complicates the previous measurement of @xmath12 by nutev , and its interpretation should therefore not be plagued by uncontrollable theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the error on the e-158 measurement is expected to reach @xmath16 , corresponding to @xmath17 , making it the most accurate determination of @xmath12 at low momentum transfer  @xcite .",
    "the study of the electroweak ( ew ) radiative corrections to scattering was initiated by czarnecki and marciano  @xcite .",
    "they found that the one - loop corrections reduce the tree - level prediction for @xmath18 by @xmath19 at low @xmath20 in a @xmath21 renormalization scheme ; the large size of this effect can be traced to the fact that while the tree level prediction is proportional to the numerically small electron vector coupling , @xmath22 , the one - loop result contains quark contributions to @xmath23 mixing not similarly suppressed .",
    "although the light quark components can not be computed in perturbation theory , they can be related to @xmath24 scattering data ; the analysis of  @xcite concludes that these effects can be determined with adequate precision .",
    "the virtual electroweak corrections to scattering for arbitrary energies were calculated in  @xcite , while the pure qed component of @xmath1 was computed in  @xcite without experimental cuts .",
    "neither of these results is sufficient for comparison with the e-158 measurement .    in this paper",
    "we compute the complete @xmath0 ew corrections to scattering , including hard bremsstrahlung effects , and impose the experimental cuts relevant for the e-158 measurement at slac .",
    "our recalculation of the virtual ew corrections is valid for arbitrary center - of - mass energies and serves as a check of the results in  @xcite , with which we agree .",
    "we find that the majority of the qed corrections to @xmath18 cancel when both virtual and hard photon corrections are added , as anticipated in  @xcite ; they contribute only a small @xmath25 shift to @xmath18 .",
    "this is due to the experimental setup of e-158 , which treats photons inclusively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present our notation and briefly discuss the tree - level scattering process .",
    "we describe the calculation of the one - loop electroweak corrections in section 3 , and explain the treatment of the hard bremsstrahlung effects in section 4 . we present the appropriate experimental cuts and numerical results in section 5 , and conclude in section 6 .",
    "in this section we present the born - level predictions for the unpolarized cross section and polarization asymmetry for the process @xmath26 .",
    "the notation introduced here will be used throughout the paper .",
    "we first introduce the following mandelstam invariants : @xmath27 in the @xmath28 scattering process described by the born - level prediction and the virtual corrections , the primed invariants are equivalent to their unprimed counterparts : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "these relations will not hold when we consider the corrections arising from photon emission .",
    "we next introduce the electron vector and axial couplings to the @xmath4 boson , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is defined in the on - shell renormalization scheme : @xmath35 .",
    "it is convenient to define the following energy - dependent effective couplings : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the charge of the electron . using these expressions , we can write the squared tree - level matrix elements as @xmath38 the subscripts encode the polarizations of the initial electrons , with @xmath39 denoting left - handed states and @xmath40 representing right - handed states .",
    "all terms of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the electron mass and @xmath43 denotes one of the invariants introduced in eq .",
    "[ mandelstam ] , have been neglected .",
    "this is an excellent approximation in the relativistic limit , and is appropriate for the e-158 experimental setup .",
    "we next define polarized differential cross sections , @xmath44 and let @xmath45 denote the integration of these expressions over the region under consideration .",
    "we remind the reader that the cross section is invariant under boosts along the beam axis if the boundaries of integration are chosen consistently in each frame .",
    "the unpolarized cross section and polarization asymmetry can now be written as @xmath46    before discussing the electroweak corrections to these quantities , we comment briefly on our on - shell choice of @xmath47 .",
    "numerically , @xmath48 in the on - shell scheme , while the @xmath21 value is @xmath49 . recalling that the tree - level @xmath18 is proportional to @xmath50 , we see that the choice of the on - shell renormalization scheme tends to increase the tree - level asymmetry ; the value of @xmath18 is also affected by our choice of @xmath51 as an input , rather than @xmath52 as in  @xcite ( this choice is made to facilitate comparison with the complete ew virtual corrections computed in  @xcite ; the additional uncertainty induced by the larger experimental error in @xmath5 is small compared to the uncertainty arising from the hadronic contributions to @xmath53 mixing ) .",
    "we will find that the electroweak corrections to the born - level prediction are larger in the on - shell scheme than in the @xmath21 scheme chosen in  @xcite ( this enhancement of on - shell radiative corrections over those of the @xmath21 scheme is familiar from other studies of ew physics  @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that the prescription of  @xcite is probably a more appropriate parameterization of the tree - level prediction ; however , since we will primarily study the effects of hard bremsstrahlung on @xmath18 , this fact will not concern us here .",
    "in this section we study the one - loop electroweak corrections to the scattering process .",
    "we reduce all one - loop integrals to the scalar passarino - veltman basis  @xcite using form  @xcite ; the numerical evaluation of the resulting integrals is then performed using _ looptools _  @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements obtained are valid for @xmath54 .",
    "since the resulting expressions are rather lengthy , and have been previously discussed in the literature  @xcite , we will not present them explicitly in this manuscript ; they are available upon request from the author .",
    "we use dimensional regularization to regulate ultraviolet divergences , and an anticommuting @xmath55 ; this is appropriate since no abj anomalies are present  @xcite .",

    "the one - loop @xmath21 result of  @xcite is @xmath216 , where the quoted errors arise primarily from the hadronic uncertainties in @xmath117 ; this value does not include either bremsstrahlung effects or experimental cuts , and is evaluated at the specific phase space point @xmath217 where the tree - level prediction for @xmath18 is maximized .",
    "the very close agreement between these results is surprising and to an extent accidental ; however , we can identify the following two physics effects which contribute to the agreement : 1 ) the significant difference between the tree - level prediction for @xmath18 in the on - shell and @xmath21 renormalization schemes caused by differing choices of @xmath12 is ameliorated once virtual corrections are included , and 2 ) the experimental cuts relevant for the e-158 measurement render hard bremsstrahlung corrections a small effect .",
    "also , the @xmath218 shift induced by hard photon emission accidentally brings the weak - corrected value of @xmath18 in eq .",
    "[ noqed ] into closer agreement with the result of  @xcite .",
    "qed corrections to the photon exchange component of scattering of @xmath219 are reported in  @xcite .",
    "we believe that the large size of these results arises from the lack of experimental cuts in this calculation ; without such restrictions , large contributions from the peaking regions discussed in the previous section greatly enhance the cross section .",
    "the effects observed in a realistic experimental setup are significantly smaller , as our calculation demonstrates .",
    "we now briefly review the error on the theoretical prediction for @xmath18 .",
    "the uncertainty in the one - loop result arising from hadronic contributions to the @xmath98 vacuum polarization function has been mentioned above and discussed in the previous section ; although large , there is hope that it will be reduced in the future  @xcite .",
    "the remaining errors can be divided into those arising from either higher - order qed or weak corrections .",
    "the small magnitude of the qed corrections found in this paper , @xmath214 , indicate that the inclusion of @xmath220 effects are unnecessary ; the experimental cuts protect the e-158 measurement from large qed effects .",
    "the one - loop weak corrections are large : @xmath221 in the @xmath21 scheme and @xmath222 in the on - shell scheme .",
    "however , the size of these effects arises from quark contributions to @xmath18 not suppressed by @xmath223 , a qualitatively new feature which first appears at @xmath0 .",
    "no similar effect appears at the next order in perturbation theory , and we expect that the higher order corrections are suppressed by a factor of @xmath224 relative to the one - loop result , will induce effects that are suppressed relative to the one - loop result by @xmath225 ; however , this is still a small shift , and a large class of these contributions can be resummed if better precision is required . ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that the most significant source of theoretical uncertainty on the measurement of @xmath18 arises from the hadronic contributions to the @xmath98 vacuum polarization .    as mentioned above , the e-158 measurement double - counts events where a hard photon knocks both electrons into the detector acceptance ; this modifies the prediction for both @xmath226 and @xmath18 .",
    "we find that this leads to the following effective values of the cross section and asymmetry , as well as the following shifts from the weak - corrected results of eq .",
    "[ noqed ] : @xmath227 we have chosen @xmath228 to obtain these values , and have checked that the variation with this parameter is consistent with the statistical error of the integration .",
    "the overcounting of events leads to an effective increase of the cross section , and increases the shift of @xmath18 to @xmath229 ; subtracting from this the @xmath214 shift of table  [ nowgt ] , we find that the effect of overcounting is an @xmath230 shift in the measured value of @xmath18 .",
    "this effect is small , however , and well within the theoretical error discussed above .",
    "we have presented a calculation of the complete @xmath0 radiative corrections to scattering , and have discussed their effect on the total cross section and polarization asymmetry measured in e-158 , a low energy fixed target experiment being performed at slac .",
    "the virtual ew corrections have been previously computed in  @xcite ; our recalculation serves as a check of this result , with which we find complete agreement .",
    "our computation of the hard bremsstrahlung contributions with realistic experimental cuts is the first such result , and provides a complete theoretical prediction for comparison with the e-158 measurement .",
    "we find that hard bremsstrahlung effects induce a small @xmath3 shift in the measured value of @xmath18 ; the experimental cuts reduce the sensitivity of both the polarization asymmetry and total cross section to qed corrections .",
    "we have also reviewed the theoretical uncertainty in the prediction for @xmath18 .",
    "the largest error arises from hadronic contributions to the @xmath98 vacuum polarization function @xmath117 , as discussed in  @xcite ; an improved dispersion relation analysis of low energy @xmath120 data could reduce this value  @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that higher order qed corrections are likely to be small in comparison to the error on @xmath117 , and can be safely neglected in the e-158 analysis .",
    "the one - loop weak corrections are @xmath222 ; although this effect seems dangerously large , it arises from the appearance of effects unsuppressed by the small electron vector coupling , a qualitatively new contribution which first enters at one loop . as no similar effect appears at higher orders ,",
    "we conclude that the perturbative corrections to @xmath18 are under control .",
    "the results obtained here are applicable to both low energy experiments such as e-158 and future high energy colliders , and provide detailed standard model predictions to which measured values can be compared .",
