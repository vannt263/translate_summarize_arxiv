    "the transition between quantum hall plateaux in a two - dimensional electron gas is characterized by a divergent localization length @xmath1 with a critical exponent @xmath0 and a non - zero longitudinal conductivity @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath1 is finite and @xmath4 is zero inside the hall plateaux whereas @xmath5 is a constant .    a direct measurement of the localization length exponent in a algaas / gaas sample by koch et al .",
    "@xcite gave a value for @xmath0 very close to @xmath6 .",
    "recent high precision measurements on si mosfet @xcite and algaas / gaas samples @xcite , however , indicate that @xmath1 diverges with the electron density @xmath7 like @xmath8 or with the magnetic field @xmath9 like @xmath10 , where the quantum hall transition ( qht ) is at @xmath11 or @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the exponent @xmath13 appears to be almost independent of the material or the hall plateaux .",
    "on the other hand , the coefficients @xmath14 , @xmath15 are sensitive to disorder : they _ increase _ with increasing disorder @xcite .",
    "this is a remarkable observation because in the scaling theory of anderson localization @xcite the coefficient is related to the mean free path .",
    "that means it would _ decrease _ with increasing disorder .",
    "the observation of @xmath13 is in sharp contrast to the experiment by koch et al .",
    "the disagreement was explained in @xcite by insufficient sample size in the earlier experiment .",
    "the localization length scale near the qht was also studied intensively in a number of numerical simulations using the network model @xcite and the lowest landau level approximation @xcite .",
    "these calculations agree on the result that the critical exponent is @xmath16 .",
    "concerning the exponent @xmath0 there is a calculation by affleck @xcite based on the @xmath17 nonlinear sigma model with topological term in the replica limit @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "he obtains @xmath2 .",
    "the same value was found for dirac fermions with random vector potential if the average density is finite @xcite .",
    "a reason for the impressive agreement of the numerical calculations , on the one hand , and the disagreement between experiments , numerical and analytic calculations on the other hand could be the sensitivity of the qht to the size of the system and to the type of disorder . in particular , it may be related to the existence of a large characteristic length scale depending on disorder .",
    "the existence of such a typical scale is also indicated by the numerical results due to the fact that there is a cross - over from the pure network model ( @xmath3 ) to the random network model ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the purpose of this article is to investigate the role of disorder induced length scales in a tight  binding model with strong magnetic field .",
    "the work is based on an effective supersymmetric field theory for dirac fermions with a random mass which enables us to study large scale properties .",
    "the main results are : + 1 .",
    "spontaneous breaking of the supersymmetry .",
    "i.e. , the effective field theory for the qht is _ not _ a nonlinear sigma model .",
    "the scaling behavior of the localization length depends on the characteristic scale @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the strength of disorder : if @xmath22 the effective exponent is @xmath3 whereas for @xmath23 the exponent is @xmath2 .",
    "there is a universal value for the conductivity @xmath24 .",
    "+ the article is organized as follows : after the definition of the model in sect . ii an effective field theory is constructed for the averaged green s functions ( sect .",
    "this field theory includes the description of the conductivity according to kubo s formula .",
    "then a collective field representation is introduced in order to cover symmetry breaking effects ( sect .",
    "the latter are discussed using a saddle point approximation for the collective field ( sect .",
    "gaussian fluctuations around the saddle points and corrections to gaussian fluctuations are studied in sects .",
    "iii.c and iii.d , respectively . finally , the localization length ( sect .",
    "iv ) and the conductivity ( sect .",
    "v ) are evaluated .",
    "a lattice model is considered in this article , stressing the universality in terms of the electron density and the magnetic field observed in the experiment , to study the asymptotic behavior of the localization length near the qht .",
    "starting point is a microscopic model for non - interacting electrons on a regular lattice in a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "disorder enters only through a random potential on the lattice .",
    "this choice guarantees that the disorder does not affect the homogeneity of the magnetic field .",
    "the model is defined by the tight - binding hamiltonian on a square lattice with magnetic flux @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the lattice constant and @xmath27 the homogeneous external magnetic field .",
    "there is nearest neighbor hopping with rate @xmath28 and next nearest neighbor hopping with rate @xmath29 .",
    "the hamiltonian reads in landau gauge @xmath30+\\sum_rv(r)c(r ) c^\\dagger(r ) .",

    "@xmath34 is a random potential representing disorder on the lattice . without disorder , i.e. , for @xmath35",
    ", this model was discussed extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "a central result is the occurence of electron bands with a quantized hall conductivity in each band .",
    "gaps can be created in the model , for instance , by choosing a staggered potential @xmath36 in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) @xcite . by varying the staggered chemical potential",
    "one varies the concentration of electrons in the system .",
    "there are other methods to create gaps in a tigh - binding model .",
    "e.g. , one could vary the magnetic field .",
    "this , however , would lead to a more complicated situation because the corresponding vector potential depends on space .",
    "in general , the relevant parameter for the quantum hall transition is the filling factor @xmath37 .",
    "this is essentially determined by the ratio of the concentration of electrons @xmath7 and the magnetic field @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the variation of the concentration of electrons ( i.e. , the chemical potential ) is equivalent with variation of the magnetic field in the quantum hall system .    in general ,",
    "the creation of new bands ( `` gap opening '' ) can be described by dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "starting from the tight - binding hamiltonian the dirac fermions can be derived in a large scale approximation .",
    "the simplest case is that with half a flux quantum per lattice plaquette ( @xmath38 ) @xcite .",
    "( such a strong magnetic flux is unrealistic in real crystals but typical for arrays of quantum dots in moderate magnetic fields @xcite . ) for half a flux quantum per plaquette it is easy to derive the dirac theory from a sublattice representation which takes into account the phase factor @xmath39 of the tight - binding hamiltonian and the staggered potential .",
    "the fourier components of the non  random part @xmath40 read @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "all elements of the matrix are measured in units of the nearest neighbor hopping rate @xmath28 .",
    "after expansion of @xmath43 for small @xmath44 vectors around the four nodes and a global orthogonal transformation @xmath45 with @xmath46 the hamiltonian becomes @xmath47 the corresponding green s function @xmath48 decays asymptotically into two diagonal blocks @xmath49 the lattice constant @xmath26 is implicitly scaled out in @xmath29 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 means asymptotics with respect to @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "thus the approximation breaks up the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) into two independent dirac hamiltonians @xmath55 with pauli matrices @xmath56 .",
    "the two dirac theories describe particles with different masses @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the next nearest neighbor hopping term lifts the degeneracy of the two dirac particles .",
    "therefore , it plays an important role in this model and must be taken into account .",
    "variation of the chemical potential implies a variation of the dirac mass .",
    "in particular , dirac fermions undergo a hall transition if the mass vanishes @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the mass breaks the time - reversal symmetry : depending on the sign of @xmath58 there is a clockwise or counterclockwise hall current . if the light dirac particle undergoes a hall transition at @xmath59 its contribution to the hall conductivity changes from @xmath60 for @xmath61 to @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "( the conductivity is in units of @xmath64 . )",
    "the heavy dirac particle contributes @xmath62 because its mass is positive .",
    "thus the combined effect is a hall step from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "this picture is particularly simple for @xmath67 but should also hold for other values of the flux as long as the low energy excitations are linear and can be described by dirac fermions .    for large scale properties like for the critical behavior near the hall transition it is sufficient to consider only the light particle with @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the lattice gradient operator .",
    "disorder , originally introduced in @xmath9 by the random potential @xmath71 , appears in @xmath72 as a diagonal matrix @xmath73 with independent random elements @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "the appearence of two random variables per site is a consequence of the sublattice representation required by the phase factor @xmath39 of the tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "the random matrix @xmath73 is equivalent to a random mass @xmath76 and a random energy @xmath77 . for technical reasons",
    "the random energy term will be neglected in the following .",
    "it should be noticed that the random mass is marginally irrelevant on a perturbative level @xcite .",
    "however , going beyond perturbation theory , it turns out that the random mass leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking which changes the properties significantly @xcite .",
    "this effect has not been included in previous studies of the localization properties near the hall transition .",
    "it will be important for the considerations in this article .",
    "dirac fermions can also be derived as the large scale approximation of the network model @xcite .",
    "it was recently pointed out by ho and chalker @xcite that the network implies a random dirac mass ( due to fluctuations in the tunneling rates ) , a random energy ( due to fluctuations in the flux per plaquette ) and a random vector potential ( due to fluctuations in the phase of the hopping elements ) .",
    "i.e. , in terms of the network model the random dirac mass requires a fixed flux per plaquette and a fixed phase for the current between the vertices of the network .",
    "this is probably the simplest situation for the realization of a qht .    after averaging with respect to the random mass",
    "the localization length @xmath1 , measured in lattice units @xmath78 for electrons in a magnetic field @xmath27 , is defined as the decay length of the function @xmath79 .",
    "the relation @xmath80 means that @xmath1 is given by the product of two green s function at frequencies with _ opposite sign _ ( retarded and advanced green s functions ) . due to the @xmath81 block structure of @xmath82 there exists a relation between green s functions at @xmath83 and green s functions at @xmath84 : @xmath85 this identity reflects the lorentz - covariance of the dirac theory .",
    "it implies @xmath86 and @xmath87 this means that only the green s functions with one frequency is required for the evaluation of localization properties in the relativistic model .",
    "the averaged quantity @xmath88 is translational invariant .",
    "therefore , it can be expressed by its fourier components @xmath89 .",
    "this can be used to calculate the localization length @xmath1 .",

    ", these labels are not written explicitly . )",
    "the correlation function @xmath92 for large @xmath93 is proportional to @xmath94 with some exponent @xmath95 for which we assume that it is fixed for the model and does not depend on the parameters .",
    "this implies that @xmath96 dropping the constant term from the ratio of sums on the right hand side of ( [ ll ] ) , the localization length can be defined in terms of the fourier components as @xmath97 the localization length is finite for @xmath98 but diverges in the regime of delocalized states with @xmath99 .",
    "the localization length for massless dirac fermions without disorder diverges like @xmath100 if @xmath101 is approached .",
    "this behavior is probably unstable against arbitrarily weak randomness , as it will be shown in this article .",
    "however , it has been shown in a previous paper @xcite that the localization length of the averaged correlation function has a lower bound which is the energy  energy correlation length of the 2d random bond ising model .",
    "since the latter diverges at the critical points , this implies a divergent localization length at the qht .",
    "the calculation for the network model of chalker and coddington @xcite , indicates that the critical exponent @xmath3 of the pure model may change to @xmath102 due to disorder .",
    "this was discussed as a possible appearence of a new random fixed point of the random model @xcite . however , a new fixed point with such a behavior has not been found so far in terms of renormalization group calculations .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a functional integral representation for @xmath92 , because this provides a basis to apply an approximation using a saddle point integration . the product of green s functions on the right hand side of ( [ id1 ] ) and ( [ id2 ] )",
    "can formally be written as @xmath103 with the quadratic form of the superfield @xmath104",
    "@xmath105 @xmath106 is a complex field and @xmath107 a grassmann field , respectively .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath9 appears in the quadratic form for the complex field whereas @xmath108 appears for the grassmann field .",
    "this difference will turn out to be crucial for the localization properties of the dirac fermions .",
    "in particular , it will give all the delocalized states expected near the hall transition .",
    "in contrast , the quadratic form where @xmath9 is used in the grassmann sector instead of @xmath108 does not give these critical properties @xcite .",
    "averaging with respect to disorder leads to @xmath109 a gaussian distribution of the random dirac mass is assumed in the following with mean @xmath58 and variance @xmath21 . then the average can be performed exactly giving an additional quartic interaction term in @xmath110 with coupling constant @xmath21 . for weak disorder ,",
    "i.e. , small @xmath21 , one could apply perturbation theory .",
    "unfortunately , this does not lead to interesting results because it can not catch spontaneous symmetry breaking . in order to deal with the latter one must construct a representation which describes the field which is the conjugate to the symmetry breaking terms of the dirac theory , the mass @xmath58 and the frequency @xmath111 .",

    "it was found @xmath248.\\ ] ] for @xmath245 the hall conductivity is always @xmath249 whereas for @xmath250 it depends on disorder via @xmath251 .",
    "the resistivity , calculated from the averaged conductivities ( which is an additional approximation because one should actually evaluate the averaged resistivity ) yields @xmath252 this value agrees with an error of about @xmath253 with various experimental results @xcite .",
    "for a given strength of randomness @xmath21 there are three different regimes of the behavior of the localization length , depending on the value of @xmath156 .",
    "@xmath156 is directly related to the frequency @xmath111 according to the equations ( [ spe1 ] ) , ( [ spe2 ] ) and ( [ spe3 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the corresponding power laws @xmath254 appear with effective exponents @xmath255 and @xmath256 and with the asymptotic exponent @xmath257 .",
    "the exponents and the corresponding coefficients @xmath258 are shown in table i , and the @xmath21 dependence of the coefficients is plotted in fig .",
    "2 . ludwig et al . evaluated the exponent @xmath0 for two - dimensional dirac fermions with random vector potential with variance @xmath259 . in that case",
    "the exponent of the asymptotic localization length depends smoothly on randomness as @xmath260 @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that the inequality @xmath261 of chayes et al .",
    "@xcite for two  dimensional random systems does not apply to the problem under consideration ( cf also the discussion in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is remarkable though that there is agreement of the asymptotic result @xmath2 between the present calculation for the random dirac mass , the random vector potential with finite average density of states ( where @xmath262 ) @xcite and the nonlinear sigma model with topological term @xcite .",
    "the result @xmath230 is not reliable because it appears close to the critical points @xmath211 , where the bosonic degrees of freedom become critical .",
    "moreover , the asymptotic regime with @xmath2 is not realistic : the typical width of the fluctuations @xmath263 in a sample is about @xmath264 of the hopping rate .",
    "i.e. , @xmath265 is immeasurably small .",
    "therefore , only the regime @xmath266 would be accessible , and only the effective exponent @xmath3 , together with the coefficient @xmath267 , is of practical relevance .",
    "consequently , only the coefficient of the localization length is affected by randomness .",
    "this is in agreement with the observations in refs.@xcite .",
    "however , the divergency of the localization length is controversal among the various experiments . in this context",
    "it would be interesting if the cross - over length , evaluated in the article as @xmath268 , can be observed experimentally .",
    "the density of states is non ",
    "zero near the qht .",
    "this result is non  perturbative because @xmath269 , and it reflects spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "it agrees with a monte carlo simulation for the network model by lee and wang @xcite , with an exact diagonalization of a finite system @xcite , with a rigorous estimation @xcite and with an exact calculation for lorentzian disorder @xcite .    the longitudinal conductivity @xmath270 is non  zero between @xmath271 and @xmath272 , the transition region between two hall plateaux . in an experiment it may not be possible to resolve the width of this band of delocalized states since @xmath251 is too small .",
    "therefore , the width of the transition between the hall plateaux will always be dominated by thermal broadening .",
    "thus a power law for the width @xmath273 at temperature @xmath274 like @xmath275 @xcite is a realistic ansatz .",
    "the conductivity at the qht should agree with the value of @xmath4 at @xmath245 , i.e. , @xmath276 .",
    "converting this value into the corresponding value of @xmath277 gives @xmath278 which is in good agreement with experiments .",
    "the universal value @xmath276 agrees with the value found for random vector potential @xcite but not with the result found from the numerical simulation of the network model , where @xmath279 was found @xcite .",
    "this value was also obtained for the lowest landau level projection @xcite .",
    "it seems that our results for the 2d dirac fermions with random mass are in good agreement with the corresponding results for 2d dirac fermions with random vector potential and with recent experiments .",
    "but there is disagreement with the results of the numerical simulation of the network model .",
    "this may be related to different types of randomness ( e.g. , strong randomness in the magnetic field ) or to different geometries .",
    "it is also possible that there is a strong renormalization of the localization length near @xmath196 due to extended boson fields leading to an exponent @xmath19 .",
    "this , however , would raise the question about the origin of the experimental value @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the disagreement of the values of @xmath280 for the network model on the one side and for dirac fermions with @xmath245 on the other side can not be explained by renormalization effects ."
