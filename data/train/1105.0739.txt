    "hzrgs are in an active stage of their evolution , with powerful radio jets emanating from a massive central black - hole . these radio jets vigorously interact with their surrounding environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and serve as beacons for tracing the faint host galaxy and surrounding proto - cluster .",
    "this makes hzrgs among the best studied high-@xmath0 objects and ideal laboratories for investigating both the formation and evolution of galaxies / clusters as well as the relationship between early star formation and agn activity .",
    "a crucial component in the evolutionary studies of hzrgs and their associated star formation processes is a detailed knowledge about the content and properties of the molecular gas .",

    "the co has been resolved on scales of several tens of kpc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "despite these results , two major limitations to systematic searches for co in hzrgs have been the very limited velocity coverage of existing mm - spectrometers ( often not much wider than the velocity range of the co gas and/or the accuracy of the redshift ) and the fact that most observatories can only target the higher rotational transitions of co at high-@xmath0 .",
    "while these higher co transitions trace the dense and thermally excited gas ( such as that in the nuclear starburst / agn region ) , @xcite suggest that more widely distributed reservoirs of less dense and sub - thermally excited gas could be largely missed by these observations and could thus more easily be detected in the lower transitions than often assumed ( see also e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "if this correlation is also valid for hzrgs , the co(1 - 0 ) luminosity of mrc  0152 - 209 implies a fir luminosity of order @xmath64 @xmath65 @xcite , well in the regime of ulirgs .",

    "assuming that the molecular gas in mrc  0152 - 209 offers a reservoir to sustain this maximum star formation rate , the lower limit on the gas depletion time - scale is t@xmath73 myr ( with @xmath74 the star formation efficiency ) . according to models by @xcite ,",
    "this minimum gas depletion time - scale is comparable to the typical lifetime of a massive burst of star formation during a major merger , which could give the merging system the appearance of a ulirg for about @xmath75 myr ( although @xcite show that for high-@xmath0 smgs a starburst age of several 100 myr is more realistic ) .",

    "the co(1 - 0 ) luminosity of mrc  0152 - 209 is an order of magnitude larger than that found in nearby radio galaxies @xcite , indicating that mrc  0152 - 209 contains significantly more molecular gas than its low-@xmath0 counterparts .",
    "assuming @xmath52 , the h@xmath13 mass of mrc  0152 - 209 is of the same order as that derived from co detections in other hzrgs @xcite as well as from a survey of high-@xmath0 smgs @xcite .",
