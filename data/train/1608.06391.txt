    "the signal selection criteria and the signal and background probability density functions ( pdfs ) used in this measurement rely on the use of monte carlo ( mc ) simulation samples .",

    "we measure the cosine of the angle @xmath146 between the momenta of the @xmath0 lepton and its daughter meson in the rest frame of the virtual @xmath42 boson , @xmath147 as shown in fig .",

    "the rest frame of the virtual @xmath42 is obtained from its three - momentum @xmath149 in this frame of reference , the magnitude of the @xmath0 momentum is determined only by @xmath141 since the @xmath0 lepton is emitted in the two - body decay of the static virtual @xmath42 boson .",
    "therefore @xmath150 is calculated as @xmath151 we only accept events , for which @xmath152 . here , more than 97% of the reconstructed signal events are retained .    due to limited kinematic constraints , one degree of freedom of the @xmath0 momentum direction",
    "is not determined",
    ". however , the cone around @xmath153 with an angle of @xmath146 , on which @xmath154 lies , is rotationally symmetric and therefore all directions on this cone are equivalent . with this in mind , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig - coshel ] , there are many @xmath159 background events that peak around @xmath160 , which corresponds to @xmath161 , in the @xmath4 sample .",
    "this peak arises from low - momentum muons that do not reach the klm and are therefore misreconstructed as pions .",
    "to mitigate this background , we only use the region @xmath162 in the fit , in which 94% ( 81% ) of signal events are contained with the sm @xmath28 of @xmath163 ( maximum @xmath28 of @xmath164 ) .",
    "in order to separate signal and normalization events from background , we use the variable @xmath165 , the summed energy of ecl clusters not used in the reconstruction of the @xmath80 and @xmath70 candidates .",
    "this is a useful variable for the signal extraction since the @xmath165 shape is less affected by changes in kinematics due to np .",
    "the variable @xmath166 is additionally used for normalization events , and is defined as @xmath167 where @xmath168 and @xmath169 are the energy and the three - momentum , respectively , of the charged lepton ; the other variables in this formula are defined in eq .",
    "[ eq - q2 ] . due to its narrow concentration near @xmath170 , this",

    "the most significant background contribution is from events with incorrectly - reconstructed @xmath27 ( denoted `` fake @xmath27 events '' ) .",
    "since the combinatorial fake @xmath27 background processes are difficult to be modeled precisely in the mc , we compare the pdf shapes of these events in @xmath132 sideband regions .",

    "these sideband regions contain 550 times more events than the signal region .",
    "while we find good agreement of the @xmath165 shapes between the data and the mc for the signal sample , we observe a slight discrepancy in the @xmath166 distributions of the @xmath115 and @xmath131 modes for the normalization sample .",
    "the @xmath166 discrepancy is therefore corrected based on this comparison . in both samples , since up to 20% of the yield discrepancies are observed , the fake @xmath27 yields are scaled by the yield ratios of the data to the mc in the @xmath132 sideband regions .",
    "semileptonic decays to excited charm modes , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , comprise an important background category as they have a similar decay topology to the signal events .",
    "in addition , background events from various types of hadronic @xmath11 decays wherein some particles are not reconstructed are significant in this analysis since there are only hadrons and two neutrinos in the final state of the signal mode .",

    "the exception is the decay to two @xmath93 mesons , such as @xmath171 and @xmath172 , since these are experimentally well measured : we fix their yields based on the world - average branching fractions  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the yield determination , the pdf shape of these background must be taken into account , as a change in the @xmath11 decay composition may modify the @xmath165 shape and thereby introduce biases in the measurement of @xmath45 and @xmath28 . if a background @xmath11 decay contains a @xmath50 in the final state , it may peak in the @xmath165 signal region .",
