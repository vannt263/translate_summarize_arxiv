    "the interplay between black hole accretion , radiation , and the surrounding gas , produce the characteristic emission from the well - studied broad and narrow emission line regions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "but the degree to which a quasar can influence its host galaxy on scales @xmath20 is much less clear .",
    "indeed , just a few percent of the energy @xmath21 emitted by a quasar is comparable to the binding energy of a massive galaxy @xmath22erg , and thus capable of ejecting its interstellar medium ( ism ) or shock - heating it to temperatures @xmath23k .",
    "the bulges of all local galaxies harbor supermassive black holes @xcite , the masses of which are tightly correlated with the properties of their host spheroids , measured on scales @xmath24 kpc @xcite .",
    "this has led many to speculate that some `` feedback '' mechanism couples the quasar phase of rapid supermassive black hole growth with the evolution of its host galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "besides explaining the correlation between black holes and bulges , feedback from an agn has also been invoked on even larger scales , as the energy source which `` quenches '' star - formation in massive galaxies , leaving them `` red and dead '' .",
    "the observed bimodality in the galaxy color - magnitude diagram @xcite and the sharp cutoff at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function @xcite both point to some physical mechanism which shuts off star - formation in massive galaxies .",
    "otherwise , large quantities of gas should have accreted onto the progenitors of ellipticals resulting in an unseen population of very massive blue galaxies .",
    "it is generally believed that the coupling between the quasar and the galaxy is `` kinetic '' in nature , involving galactic - scale outflows which suppress gas accretion and inject heat , ultimately shutting off star - formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", can extend to several tens of kpc from the optical host galaxies , providing the most compelling evidence that an agn can impact its galactic scale surroundings .",
    "it is unclear , however , whether this jet energy @xmath25erg ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) couples strongly to the ambient ism @xcite .",
    "in addition to the tremendous radio power , @xmath26 hzrgs are often associated with giant ly@xmath19 recombination nebulae , with sizes of up to @xmath27kpc , sometimes extending well beyond the radio emission ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "ionizing radiation from the central agn , thought to be obscured from our vantage point , is likely to play a significant role in exciting this emission .",
    "but the extreme kinematics of these nebulae ( @xmath28 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their complex irregular morphology , the tendency for the line emission to be aligned with the axis of the radio jets , and their near solar metallicities @xcite , strongly suggest that jet - gas interactions or feedback from the agn are giving rise to a large - scale outflow , and shocks from these motions could also be triggering the emission .",
    "but the comoving number density of hzrgs and giant ly@xmath19  nebulae , @xmath29 @xcite , is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the number density of luminous quasars .",
    "thus only about one in a thousand of the supermassive black holes in the universe exhibit such dramatic evidence for feedback during their active phase years , they can not represent a short lived phase of evolution in every quasar .",
    "] , which would do little to quench star - formation in the entire population of local massive galaxies .",
    "is feedback occurring in the typical quasar in the universe ?",
    "while it has been argued that heating from a quasar is responsible for quenching massive galaxies @xcite , an alternative scenario is related to the physics of structure formation in a hierarchical universe .",
    "this idea goes back to a classic argument first made by @xcite that the ability to cool on a dynamical timescale is what sets the upper bound for the mass of luminous galaxies . at low halo masses",
    "the cooling time of gas is shorter than the dynamical time resulting in a `` cold accretion '' mode , limited only by the supply of infalling material . for halos with @xmath30 , the cooling time exceeds the dynamical time , which is the criterion for the formation of a stable accretion shock @xcite . in these more massive halos , subsequent infalling gas is shock heated and pressure supported by a hot halo in quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "however , cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have shown that although the majority of gas is shock - heated to the virial temperature , some level of `` cold mode '' accretion still takes place in even the most massive halos @xcite .",
    "it is unknown whether the formation of a hot - halo alone can quench future star - formation and explain the red and dead galaxy population .",
    "@xcite recently proposed a quenching scenario whereby the gravitational energy of cosmological accretion can serve as a heat source to quenching star formation , provided that a cold ( @xmath31k ) phase of pressure - confined ( and thus long lived ) gas clumps ( @xmath32 ) form , which can penetrate the halo and deliver the necessary heat .",
    "understanding the role that quasar feedback , hot halos , cold accretion , and pressure confined clumps play in quenching star - formation , requires studying the physical state of the gas on scales 10kpc-1mpc in the high redshift progenitors of local massive red galaxies .",

    "these low masses allowed them to convincingly argue that @xmath33 star - forming galaxies _ do not _ evolve into the quenched red and dead galaxies that we see today , but rather evolve into blue @xmath35 galaxies similar to the milky way .",
    "but the strong clustering of luminous quasars at @xmath0 implies larger dark halo masses @xmath36 @xcite , indicating that they _ are indeed the progenitors of local red and dead galaxies_. of course , we are only observing a small fraction @xmath37 of these progenitors as quasars at any given time because the quasar lifetime is much shorter than the age of the universe .",
    "however quasar spectra have thus far provided little insight into the state of gas in their galactic environments for two reasons .",
    "first , the large ionizing flux from the quasar typically photoionizes the hydrogen in and around the galactic host @xcite , which would otherwise be detected as strong absorption at the quasar redshift .",
    "second , the interpretation of material that is detected in absorption along the line - of - sight to a quasar is limited by the unknown distance between the material and the quasar .",
    "a systematic search for the signatures of photoionized gas near quasars ( e.g.  via , absorption ) is only now being carried out on statistical datasets @xcite .",
    "observers do frequently identify narrow associated absorption lines ( naals ) or so - called `` associated absorbers '' which are believed to arise in the quasar environment .",
    "some of these are attributed to gas on sub - pc scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but other examples exhibit ionization states that suggest the gas lies at several tens of kpc @xcite . note that these associated absorbers are distinct from the broad absorption line ( bal ) features which arise from dense clumps of material that have been ionized and accelerated by the quasar , and are generally believed to be confined to sub - kpc scales ( but see * ? ? ?",

    ", we have introduced a novel technique to study the physical state of gas in the ism and halo of luminous quasars , which has the potential to provide powerful constraints on feedback , quenching and the physics of massive galaxy formation .",
    "namely , we use a background quasar ( b / g quasar ) sightline to probe the state of gas in absorption in the vicinity of a foreground quasar ( f / g quasar ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "although such projected quasar pair sightlines are extremely rare , ( * ? ?",

    "i @xcite , we searched 149 b / g quasar spectra for optically thick absorption in the vicinity of @xmath44 luminous f / g quasars , and uncovered a sample of 27 new quasar - absorber pairs with impact parameters ranging from @xmath45 . in paper",

    "the voigt - profile fitting is most reliably performed on unsaturated transitions of ions which show similar velocity structure . in this case , one can ` tie ' the redshifts of the components which comprise the velocity profile for all of the ions analyzed and only allow the column densities and doppler parameters to vary .",

    "therefore , we calculate the high - ion column densities using the aodm method integrated across the entire velocity interval of each subsystem .",
    "we conclude that the high - ion gas arises in a distinct phase with a unique velocity field . in the ionization modeling that follows ( @xmath54  [ sec : ion ] )",

    "the velocity profiles of subsystem b are more complicated than subsystems a and c. this complex absorption precludes a well constrained line - profile solution based on individual voigt profiles .",

    "one goal is to test the hypothesis that the nearby quasar sdssj1204 + 0221fgis shining on the gas .",
    "a test of this hypothesis is to compare the intensity of the ionizing radiation field that reproduces the observed ionic ratios with the predicted flux of the quasar at the impact parameter of the sightline .",

    "these measurements reflect the integrated star formation history of the galaxy that hosts ( or hosted ) the absorber and , in turn , star - formation in this quasar environment .",
    "standard practice is to gauge the contributions of typeii nucleosynthesis relative to typei abundances from estimates of the @xmath19/fe ratio where @xmath19-elements include o , mg , si , and s. the data also constrain the n abundance which is expected to trace nucleosynthesis by intermediate mass stars and therefore offers unique constraints on the timescales of star formation @xcite .",
    "this requires an assessment of the ionization state to estimate corrections to the observed ionic ratios .",
    "the analysis focuses on multiple ionization states of individual elements ( e.g.  n@xmath225/n@xmath226 , si@xmath226/si@xmath227 ) to avoid uncertainties related to intrinsic abundances .",
    "for an optically thick absorber , one expects absorption from ions with ionization potentials ( ips ) of one to a few ryd .",
    "ions with lower ionization potentials should be absent because gas is essentially transparent to photons with energies less than 1ryd .",
    "photons with energies above a few ryd will be significantly attenuated by the gas and for @xmath228ryd by helium .",

    "this is characteristic of lyman limit systems where the large opacity self - shields gas from local or background uv sources .",
    "elements therefore occupy the first ionization state ( termed the low - ion ) with an ionization potential greater than 1ryd .",
    "one also identifies strong absorption that traces the observed profile in subsystem  a. the measured ratio of these ionization states is large , @xmath235 = + 1.8$]dex , revealing the gas is partially ionized . on the other hand",
    ", there is only weak and absorption at these velocities indicating the ionization state of the gas is not extreme .",
    "furthermore , the absence of strong and absorption at these velocities limits the flux of photons with energies @xmath236ryd and also rules out a collisionally ionized gas with @xmath237k ( see figure  [ fig : cie ] ) .",
    "qualitatively , the data suggest a partially ionized gas with @xmath238k .",
    "there are two main mechanisms that produce a partially ionized gas : collisional ionization and photoionization . under the assumption of collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ;",

    "we achieve a similar limit by fitting the n gas and si gas independently at the same redshift and use the difference in doppler parameters to estimate @xmath243 .",

    "therefore , one can not rule out a model where collisional ionization is the primary mechanism producing the observed ionic ratios , although to invoke this scenario one must introduce a heat source to maintain the gas at this temperature because the cooling time is short ( @xmath246yr ) for any reasonable density . in the following photoionization modelling , we will however assume that photoionization is dominant and thereby set an upper limit to the intensity of the ionizing radiation field .",

    "the results are largely insensitive to this choice of volume density ( they are nearly homologous with @xmath255 ) , but they do vary with metallicity because this affects the cooling rate of the gas and the electron density . we will demonstrate that the assumed metallicity is consistent with the [ o / h ] value inferred from the observed o@xmath225/h@xmath225 ratio . for the calculations , we assume a power - law spectrum @xmath256 which is representative of @xmath257 quasars @xcite .",
    "the results are nearly identical if we instead use the extragalactic uv background ( euvb ) field computed by @xcite because the radiation fields have very similar slopes at the energies that span the ionization potentials of the observed ions ( @xmath258ryd ) . when the input @xmath255 parameter is varied , the algorithm varies the number of gas slabs to maintain a constant @xmath99  value .",

    "second , the large relative velocities among the subsystems of slls / sdssj1204 + 0221bg  contradicts the notion of a collimated flow  in order for an outflow to remain collimated out to @xmath648 kpc is must have a very small velocity shear .    for the case of a large - scale outflow driven by intense star - formation or accretion onto the agn ,",
    "there are three issues to consider : ( i ) is there a viable physical mechanism present to drive a wind to the observed speed ? ; ( ii ) will the outflow propagate to a distance exceeding the observed impact parameter , that is @xmath649kpc ? ; and ( iii ) will the outflow yield an asymmetric velocity field relative to @xmath7 ?",
    "the last point requires an asymmetric outflow which might be achieved by an irregular gas distribution in the halo of sdssj1204 + 0221fg  ( e.g.  variable inertia in different directions ) or if the gas has been asymmetrically photoionized by the quasar .",
    "the required outflow speed , meanwhile , is a very challenging constraint . allowing for viewing angle , portions of the outflow would need speeds of greater than 1000 km  s@xmath72 .",

    "finally , theoretical treatments of galactic outflows suggest these will not extend to this large distance in halos with masses characteristics of @xmath401 quasar host galaxies @xcite , but of course this depends on the assumed energetics of the flow .",
    "in what follows we will use the observed properties of slls / sdssj1204 + 0221bg  to estimate , in an order of magnitude sense , the energetics of the presumed outflow , under the assumption that we have detected cold swept up material .",

    "the strong clustering of optically thick absorbers around @xmath257 quasars @xcite implies the slls is likely to lie at a distance near the observed transverse distance ( see figure  [ fig : cluster ] ) .",
    "we summarize in the next subsection several interpretations drawn from associating slls / sdssj1204 + 0221bg  with the galactic halo of sdssj1204 + 0221fg .",
    "we tested the hypothesis that the slls / sdssj1204 + 0221bg  is illuminated by ionizing radiation from f / g quasar by comparing the radiation field intensity inferred from analysis of the slls against the value expected from sdssj1204 + 0221fg . adopting the most conservative parameters for the slls ( @xmath718 and @xmath719 ) , illumination of the slls",
    "can not be ruled out if it is located at @xmath507kpc from sdssj1204 + 0221fg . adopting more realistic values ( @xmath435 and @xmath720 )",
    ", we conclude that slls / sdssj1204 + 0221bg  is not illuminated by sdssj1204 + 0221fg , unless the slls is located at an unlikely distance of greater than 500kpc .",
    "we further demonstrated that if a system like slls / sdssj1204 + 0221bg  were located along the sightline to a bright quasar at @xmath721kpc , and hence illuminated , then it would exhibit properties characteristic of the narrow associated absorption line ( naal ) systems .",
    "this would include strong absorption by high - ion transitions of , , and , optically thin absorption , and solar chemical abundances .",
    "the absence of strong high - ion absorption in this slls further suggests it is not illuminated by sdssj1204 + 0221fg  and it also indicates that there is not a large reservoir of warm ( @xmath722 to 10@xmath493k ) gas in the halo surrounding the quasar .",
    "we suggest that there may still be a diffuse shock heated medium but that it has a high temperature ( @xmath723k ) , characteristic of the virial temperature of the massive dark matter halo @xmath724 expected to be hosting the f / g quasar .",
    "if it exists , this material undetectable in absorption with the transitions accessible with our b / g quasar spectrum .",
    "the covering factor of cold @xmath725 , neutral , optically thick gas is nearly unity for transverse sightlines to @xmath257 quasars with @xmath726 @xcite , although this high column density absorbing gas is rarely observed along the line - of - sight to individual quasars @xcite .",
    "the explanation for this anisotropic absorption is that the transverse direction is much less likely to be illuminated by the f / g quasar ionizing flux , either because of obscuration or intermittent emission @xcite . besides this anisotropic absorption pattern ,",
    "several independent lines of evidence corroborate this picture for the case of sdssj1204 + 0221 . first , we modeled the ionization state of slls / sdssj1204 + 0221bg which indicates that the gas is unlikely illuminated by sdssj1204 + 0221fg  ( see   [ sec : shining ] ) .",
    "second , we failed to detect high - ion transitions like or that should have been seen if the gas were highly ionized by a hard radiation field ( see   [ sec : high ] ) .",
    "third , we showed that if gas clouds similar to those in slls / sdssj1204 + 0221bg  were at a similar distance along the line - of - sight ( and hence illuminated ) , they would explain the population of much more highly ionized associated naals , commonly detected in quasar spectra ( see   [ sec : nal ] ) .",
    "fourth , fluorescent ly@xmath19  emission is not observed near @xmath409 in sdssj1204 + 0221  @xcite ; whereas the clouds responsible for the high covering factor of optically thick gas @xcite near quasars ( three such clouds were detected in slls / sdssj1204 + 0221bg ) , would be emitting detectable ly@xmath19  photons if illuminated @xcite . the upshot of this anisotropic illumination picture",
    "is that the b / g quasar sightline probes the physical state of gas near sdssj1204 + 0221fg  which is _ shadowed and hence unaltered by the intense ionizing radiation emitted by the f / g quasar_.    by combining the statistical covering factor measured by @xcite with the total @xmath421 column determined for slls / sdssj1204 + 0221bg , we argued in   [ sec : cold ] that the amount of cold gas at @xmath727kpc is significant , amounting to @xmath728 of the total expected gas density of the f / g quasar s dark matter halo , if the gas fraction @xmath573 is equal to the cosmic baryon fraction @xmath729 . similarly , if one assumes the material is distributed in a thin shell of radius @xmath409 which subtends @xmath730 , the implied gas mass is @xmath731 .",
    "although we have deduced much about the physical state of this cold gas ( see table  [ tab : summ ] ) , its origin is still unclear .",
    "the biggest clue could lie in its extreme enrichment patterns .",
    "the nearly solar metallicity of slls / sdssj1204 + 0221bg  and its roughly solar n / o relative abundance make it anomalous relative to the population of intervening slls and dlas ( see figure  [ fig : relabnd ] ) .",
    "indeed at @xmath552 such high metallicities have only been observed on kpc scales in starburst galaxies @xcite and solar n / o has only been observed in the broad - line regions of quasars @xcite or in the naals @xcite .",
    "how do we explain the presence of such a large cold gas mass of highly enriched material with a broad - line - region - like enrichment pattern at such a large distance from the quasar @xmath13 ?",
    "it is tempting ( and fashionable ) to associate the absorbing material with a large scale outflow or galactic wind .",
    "if we are observing dense material swept up by an outflow then the energetics are extreme @xmath732 .",
    "a starburst can not drive this wind unless we are willing to consider unprecedented star - formation rates @xmath733 .",
    "radiation pressure feedback from the quasar can not drive an outflow with this power even if its bolometric luminosity were completely absorbed by dust grains ( along a different direction than our line - of - sight ) . however , the power of the flow is only a few percent of sdssj1204 + 0221fg s estimated bolometric luminosity , or similarly , its energy is of order a percent of the radiated rest - mass energy required to grow a @xmath734 black hole .",
    "so the feedback hypothesis suggests a coupling between black hole accretion and outflow which is comparable to the value used by simulators to reproduce the supermassive black hole @xmath735 correlation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , radiative losses from such an energetic flow could be significant , so our estimate of the coupling factor must be considered a lower limit . if we are in fact observing feedback in slls / sdssj1204 + 0221bg , then the kinematics , radial extent , and high metallicity of the emergent outflow bear intriguing similarities to the giant ly@xmath19  nebulae observed in high - z radio galaxies .",
    "however , it is difficult to explain why such an energetic outflow would result in so little material at intermediate temperature @xmath736 , which we would have easily detected ( but did not , see ",
    "[ sec : high ] ) .",
    "but we may not be observing an outflow at all .",
    "the observed kinematics in slls / sdssj1204 + 0221bg , although extreme relative to the intervening slls population , are consistent with the expected gravitational motions if the f / g quasar is indeed hosted by a massive dark matter halo @xmath737 , as indicated by the strong clustering of @xmath49 quasars @xcite . in this alternative scenario ,",
    "the absorption is being caused by cold clouds , with sizes @xmath738 , unit covering factor and implied volume filling factor @xmath739 , which are either infalling or virialized in the deep potential well of the massive dark matter halo .",
    "we estimated the pressure of these clouds to be @xmath740 , which intriguingly matches the pressure of the @xmath741 shock - heated gas expected to permeate the massive dark matter halo hosting the f / g quasar .",
    "this pressure equilibrium is reminiscent of a large class of galaxy formation models that postulate cold @xmath742 clouds pressure confined by a hot shock heated virialized medium @xcite , and these scenarios might explain the lack of significant intermediate temperature @xmath743 gas near the f / g quasar .",
    "however , if we are indeed detecting pressure confined cold clouds undergoing gravitational motions , why should these clouds have such a high metallicity ?",
    "this question is all the more puzzling considering that the expected cooling time of the tenuous virialized hot gas would be comparable to the hubble time at @xmath744 . while it may be more plausible to associate the cold gas and metals with star - forming galaxies clustered around the quasar",
    ", they would need to be extremely abundant @xmath745 to produce the near unit covering factor of cold gas and metals .",
    "these faint @xmath644 dwarf galaxies would need to enrich spheres of @xmath746kpc to solar metallicity , which seems implausible in light of the low metallicities observed in most dlas ( see figure  [ fig : relabnd ] ) and the similarly low values seen locally in dwarf galaxies .",

    "the lower panel plots the column density versus impact parameter for absorbers , detected in a b / g quasar spectrum , coincident with the f / g quasar ( or galaxy ) redshift .",
    "the ( red ) circles are thirteen projected quasar pairs uncovered in @xcite with @xmath747 , and ( blue ) squares are seven f / g @xmath49 star - forming galaxies studied in absorption against a bright b / g quasar by @xcite .",
    "downward pointing arrows are upper limits on @xmath99 for the f / g quasars , which reflects our inability to measure reliable column densities below @xmath748 from the moderate resolution ( fwhm @xmath749 ) b / g spectra used in @xcite .",

    "the gray shaded region indicates the range of abundances observed in the low density igm .",

    "this is nicely illustrated by the preliminary comparison of the absorption line properties of @xmath750 quasars to @xmath495 star - forming galaxies presented in fig  [ fig : simcoe ] .",
    "the primary motivation for this comparison is that , across the two populations , we are afforded a mass baseline of more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the clustering of star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 indicates that they inhabit dark matter halos with @xmath34 , making them the likely progenitors of @xmath35 galaxies that inhabit the `` blue - cloud '' of the color magnitude diagram today @xcite ; whereas , the stronger clustering of quasars at @xmath0 implies larger halo masses @xmath751 @xcite , making them progenitors of massive red - and - dead galaxies on the red sequence .",
    "hence in comparing quasars to star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 , _ we are effectively comparing the progenitors of quenched galaxies to those of un - quenched galaxies .",
    "_    the lower panel of figure  [ fig : simcoe ] plots the column density of absorbers at the f / g quasar ( or galaxy ) redshift versus the impact parameter to the b / g quasar sightline .",
    "the ( red ) circles are the thirteen f / g quasars ( @xmath752 ) with a background quasar within @xmath753 uncovered by @xcite , and ( blue ) squares are seven f / g star - forming galaxies ( @xmath754 ) studied in absorption against a bright b / g quasar by @xcite .",
    "the vertical rectangles in the upper panel illustrate the range of metallicities encountered in the individual components of each system at each impact parameter .",
    "the only f / g quasar metallicity measured thus far is for sdssj1204 + 0221  ( this work ) , whereas @xcite measured metallicities near six f / g galaxies .",
    "two notable features of fig  [ fig : simcoe ] warrant further discussion .",
    "first , at @xmath755 , one galaxy and one quasar metallicity have been measured , and both indicate abundances near solar .",
    "@xcite attributed the high metallicity of their smallest impact parameter system ( md103 ) to galaxy formation feedback , and we similarly cited the high metallicity of sdssj1204 + 0221  as the most compelling argument for an outflow powered by the quasar . by mapping out the run of abundance with impact parameter in this plot , one could characterize the size of the enriched regions around protogalaxies with a significant mass lever - arm .",
    "if feedback is responsible for the metals at large impact parameters , measuring the abundance - impact parameter relation would constrain the energetics and transport processes characterizing the relevant feedback mechanism . furthermore , this measurement would be fundamental to any discussion of the enrichment history of the igm and the icm .",
    "the second noteworthy feature of figure  [ fig : simcoe ] is that on small scales the f / g quasars appear to have @xmath99  column densities significantly larger than the f / g galaxies .",
    "this comparison is complicated by the fact that the dark matter halos that host the quasars are expected to be larger and more massive than those hosting the galaxies . for reference",
    ", @xcite estimated that the average halo mass of @xmath0 star - forming galaxies to be @xmath756 , which implies a virial radius @xmath757 ; whereas , at @xmath82 we are using @xmath758 implying @xmath759 @xcite . at an impact parameter of @xmath760 ,",
    "the ratio of the total hydrogen column densities of these dark matter halos is @xmath761 , whereas the quasars in fig  [ fig : simcoe ] have column densities a factor @xmath762 times larger than the galaxies for @xmath763 .",
    "although we caution that the statistics in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : simcoe ] are still very poor , it is nevertheless interesting to speculate about the implications of this tentative result",
    ". why would the quasars have a much larger reservoir of cold gas at @xmath764 , of order a few percent of the total expected gas density ( see   [ sec : cold ] ) , than star - forming galaxies ? can this difference be attributed to a distinct feedback mechanism operating in quasars that does not occur in star - forming galaxies ?",
    "if instead the absorbers at @xmath764 arise from cold gas accretion rather than outflows , then the larger relative density of cold gas around quasars is particularly puzzling .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamical simulations predict the opposite trend with dark halo mass : cold accretion accounts for a smaller fraction of the total accreted gas in higher mass halos where shocks become stable throughout the halo and the cold filamentary mode of accretion disappears @xcite . whether the cold gas around quasars is ejected by feedback or accreted in gravitational collapse , what is the ultimate fate of this material ?",
    "does it eventually fall back onto the quasar host galaxy or do the gas and metals blend into the igm .",
    "do we expect to observe a similar cold halo of gas around nearby massive elliptical galaxies , since their progenitors are @xmath0 quasars like sdssj1204 + 0221fg ?",
    "although preliminary , the putative trends in figure  [ fig : simcoe ] provoke fundamental questions about feedback , quenching and the physics of massive galaxy formation . yet",
    "this discussion represents just two measurements ( metallicity and @xmath99 ) gleaned from our analysis of the spectrum of sdssj1204 + 0221bg .",
    "other properties of the gas such as its kinematics , temperature , ionization structure , relative abundance patterns , the presence or absence of a hot collisionally ionized phase , and the volume density and size of the clouds , have a similar potential to constrain the physics of massive galaxy formation if they can be mapped out for statistical samples .",
    "such a statistical analysis is well within reach . to date",
    ", our pair confirmation program @xcite has confirmed about 90 pairs of quasars with impact parameter @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and about a comparable number still remain to be discovered in the existing sdss photometric data . of the known pairs ,",
    "only about five are bright enough @xmath765 for high resolution ( fhwm@xmath766 ) echelle spectroscopy like the hires spectrum used to study slls / sdssj1204 + 0221bg . however ,",
    "higher throughput but lower resolution echellette spectrographs , such as the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on keck ii , the magellan echellette ( mage ) on the magellan clay telescope , or the planned x - shooter spectrograph @xcite for the vlt , can deliver spectra with fhwm@xmath767 and the required signal to noise ratio ( @xmath404 per resolution element ) , in 1 - 2 hours for @xmath768 , which would make _ all _ of the quasar pairs known observable .",
    "although these instruments have lower spectral resolution , they roughly resolve the lyman series affording precise estimates of @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , such data would yield metallicity and relative abundance estimates to a precision of 0.3dex , and would allow for the construction of photoionization models with an accuracy comparable to that achieved in this work .    the most important aspect of the approach taken to understanding galaxy formation in this study and @xcite ( see also adelberger et al .",
    "2003 ) , is that they provide the first observational constraints on the physical state of the _ gas _ on scales @xmath769 kpc in high-@xmath1 protogalaxies .",
    "although the ideas behind quenching and feedback were introduced to explain the observed properties of local galaxy stellar populations , such as the bimodality in the color magnitude diagram @xcite and the sharp cutoff in the luminosity function @xcite , these are fundamentally gas dynamics problems .",
    "many of the relevant hydrodynamical and physical processes can be ( or are nearly ) resolved by simulation grids with current technology .",
    "conversely , predicting how this gas physics manifests itself in the stellar populations of local or high-@xmath1 galaxies requires that the uncertain `` sub - grid '' physics of star formation be inserted by hand , or with the aid of semi - analytical recipes .",

    "<S> galaxies hosting @xmath0 quasars are the high-@xmath1 progenitors of today s massive ` red - and - dead ' galaxies . with close pairs of quasars at different redshifts </S>",
    "<S> , a background quasar can be used to study a foreground quasar s halo gas in _ absorption _ , providing a wealth of information about feedback , quenching , and the physics of massive galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> we present a keck / hires spectrum of the bright background quasar in a projected pair with angular separation @xmath2 corresponding to @xmath3kpc at the redshift of the foreground quasar @xmath4 , precisely determined from gemini / gnirs near - ir spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> our echelle spectrum reveals optically thick gas ( @xmath5 ) coincident with the foreground quasar redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the ionic transitions of associated metal - lines reveal the following properties of the foreground quasar s halo : ( 1 ) the kinematics are extreme with absorption extending to @xmath6 relative to @xmath7 ; ( 2 ) the metallicity is nearly solar ; ( 3 ) the temperature of the predominantly ionized gas is @xmath8k ; ( 4 ) the electron density is @xmath9 indicating a characteristic size @xmath10pc for the absorbing ` clouds ' ; ( 7 ) there is little ( if any ) warm gas @xmath11 ; ( 8) the gas is unlikely illuminated by the foreground quasar , implying anisotropic or intermittent emission . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of cold @xmath12 gas implied by our observations is significant , amounting to a few percent of the total expected baryonic mass density of the foreground quasar s dark halo at @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this material is still unclear , and we discuss several possibilities in the context of current models of feedback and massive galaxy formation . </S>"
