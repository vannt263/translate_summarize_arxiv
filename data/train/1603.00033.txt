    "this incorporates many refinements to the code and its outputs compared to the earlier versions , mainly in the spectral synthesis results .",

    "convective overshooting is modelled by modifying the classical schwarzschild criterion for instability with an overshooting parameter of @xmath26 , a value derived from observations of binary systems by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we retain @xmath30 for consistency with the empirical mass - loss rates which were originally scaled from this value . in this study",
    "we also use models with a metallicity of @xmath8 for low metallicity environments like the small magellanic cloud .    our models do not include any rotational mixing , although at low metallicities we do include an approximate implementation of quasi - chemically homogeneous evolution due to rapid rotation @xcite .",
    "this does not occur in the initial mass range of the ecsn progenitors as we only include this for stars with an effective initial mass greater than 20m@xmath20 .",
    "we do not include wind - accretion in our binary models .",
    "roche - lobe overflow is assumed to occur when the primary star filled its roche - lobe radius and the mass - loss rate is dependent on how far it overfills the roche - lobe as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "if the mass loss does not prevent the star from expanding and the star grows to engulf its companion , common - envelope evolution is assumed to occur . in our code , it is numerically difficult to remove the stellar envelope instantaneously .",
    "we therefore set a high mass - loss rate and relate the decrease in the binary orbital energy to the amount of binding energy required to lose material from the surface of the primary star as described in @xcite .",
    "one difference to our model now is that if the secondary star also fills its roche - lobe during common - envelope evolution the stars are assumed to merge and the mass of the secondary is added to the remaining mass of the primary star .    from our grid of stellar models",
    "we select out ecsn progenitors using the mass ranges of @xcite for the co core mass .",
    "if a star has experienced core carbon burning and has a co core mass between 1.38 and 1.4  @xmath15 ,",
    "it does not experience further burning and collapses due to being above the chandrasekhar mass . however , whether the star experiences an electron - capture sn or an iron - core collapse is uncertain and depends on how details such as the urca process are modelled @xcite .",
    "we assume co cores with masses above 1.4m@xmath20 do continue growing eventually to iron - core collapse @xcite .",
    "stars below 1.38  @xmath15typically require the core to grow either by helium shell burning or thermal pulses before they could collapse .",
    "we assume if this is the case that during the time for the core to grow stellar wind mass loss removes the envelope and the star forms a white - dwarf rather than an ecsn .",
    "we note that we also require a total stellar mass greater than 1.5  @xmath15  for an ecsn to occur .",
    "only one of our models has a massive enough co core but is below this mass limit .",
    "such a star below our assumed mass limit would have very small ejecta masses and correspondingly shorter timescales of their lc evolution .",
    "the lc also becomes dependent on exactly where we chose to put in a mass cut for the amount of material ejected as shown by @xcite .",
    "we show sample evolution of some of our progenitors in kippenhahn and hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagrams in figures [ fig : kipp ] and [ fig : hrdiag ] .",
    "all three example cases are at @xmath7 .",
    "the first two cases are for stellar mergers that occur after a short common - envelope phase during the main - sequence . in the second case the merger happens towards the end of the main - sequence and",
    "so the helium core of the star is larger than what would be expected for a similar star of the same initial mass . in the third case",
    "the common - envelope evolution occurs after core helium burning ( case c ) and so their hydrogen - rich envelope is lost leaving a helium star .",
    "this star eventually becomes a helium giant which experiences another interaction reducing the helium envelope further .",
    "in all three cases we see that carbon - burning ignites centrally and burns outwards in a series of flashes . also towards the end of the evolution",
    "we see that a convection zone opens up at the edge of the co core .",
    "this reduces the co core mass to below 1.4m@xmath20 and prevents the one core from growing further .",
    "the formation of this convection zone reduces the core mass into our assumed range for ecsne . at this point",
    "our code can not calculate models further .",
    "the few models that we have been able to take further find that the central density increases and conditions for an ecsn can be obtained .",
    "we stress here that while we use a detailed evolution code the ethos behind out models is to have greater accuracy in our models than using rapid stellar evolution such as that from , e.g. @xcite , but we can not calculate large numbers of detailed models over a broad initial parameter space and include all physical effects such as the models of @xcite which is why we need to make assumptions about which of our models will experience ecsne .",
    "we note that our helium star models are similar to those recently discussed by @xcite .",
    "therefore while our evolutionary models are not evolved until the point of core collapse their similarity to these models suggests that they will do so .",
    "an advantage of our models is that we include ecsne from both primary and secondary star as well as via mergers , by following all possible channels , allowing us to estimate the rates of these events .",
    "the channels for the ecsne are similar at both metallicities as shown in figure [ fig : kipp ] .",
    "the initial mass range of the progenitors at @xmath7 ranges from 4 to 12  @xmath15 .",
    "the two channels are either case a mass - transfer that normally leads to a stellar merger .",
    "when mergers occur earlier in the main - sequence the final mass of the progenitor is similar to that expected from single - star ecsn evolution .",
    "later case a mergers tend to have less massive hydrogen - rich envelopes at the time of core - collapse .",
    "the other main channels are later case b or case c interactions which avoid a merger and remove the hydrogen - rich envelopes leaving helium stars as described by @xcite . due to the low mass of the helium stars these tend to become helium giants and some experience a second binary interaction that reduces the helium envelope mass .",
    "the nature of the progenitors when they explode in both cases are relatively cool and luminous progenitors as those with hydrogen - rich envelopes are cooler than the helium progenitors .",
    "table  [ table : ecsnprop ] summarizes predicted rates of ecsne from bpass .",
    "the total ecsn fractions in core - collapse sne are 1.5 per cent for @xmath7 and 8.6 per cent for @xmath8 .",
    "this increase is due to less mass loss because of weaker stellar wind at the lower metallicity .    we further show expected sn - type fractions of ecsne in table  [ table : ecsnprop ] .",
    "we classify ecsne from progenitors with a remaining hydrogen mass less than 0.5  @xmath15  as stripped - envelope ecsne ( type  iib and type  i ) and the others as type  ii .",

    "a typical ejecta mass of stripped - envelope ecsne is expected to be of the order of 0.1  @xmath15 .",
    "the average ejecta mass increases as the metallicity decreases because of the the scaling of stellar winds by initial metallicity as described above .",
    "we calculate bolometric lcs of stripped - envelope ecsne by using a simplified analytic method introduced by @xcite . this simplified method has been used to obtain bolometric lcs of stripped - envelope sne where the effect of hydrogen recombination in opacity is negligible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "figure  [ fig : fractions ] shows the expected distributions of their peak luminosity and rise time in which the probability distribution from the bpass model is taken into account .",
    "the typical rise time of stripped - envelope ecsn lcs is about 7  days ( @xmath7 ) and 13  days ( @xmath8 ) which are much shorter than typical stripped - envelope sne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the luminosity does reach the possible maximum from nuclear energy deposition because the small ecsn ejecta masses cause inefficient gamma - ray trapping and gamma - rays from the nuclear decay can not heat the ejecta to a great amount .",
    "there are several caveats in our simplified lc model .",
    "first , we have fixed @xmath44  in our models which can mainly affect the rise time . however , as the rise time is roughly proportional to @xmath64 @xcite , a small variation in @xmath44  has little effect on the rise time compared to @xmath46 .",
    "we also fixed @xmath45  which mainly changes the peak luminosity .",
    "if the @xmath45can vary by the face of a few , then the lc will also vary by the same factor ( about 1  mag ) . even then stripped - envelope ecsne will still be very faint transients .",
    "we have also fixed the electron - scattering opacity to @xmath58 , although this is likely a good approximation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the electron - scattering opacity may vary especially in those progenitors with a relatively large hydrogen mass ( blue lcs in figure  [ fig : lightcurves ] ) .",
    "overall , although there are several uncertainties in our lc model due to its simplicity , we expect that general lc properties we estimate in this section remain unchanged even if we were to increase the complexity of our models .",
