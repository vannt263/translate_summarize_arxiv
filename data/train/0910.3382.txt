    "the production of @xmath0 or @xmath1 bosons in conjunction with jets is an interesting process in its own right as well as background to many standard model and beyond standard model physics processes .",
    "processes with @xmath2 + jets in the final state are good candidates for testing quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . the results of measurement can be compared directly with fixed - order predictions at leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading ( nlo ) order in qcd and the gauge boson mass ensures that the interaction scale is sufficiently large for applying perturabtive calculations .    in this paper",
    "we present a feasibility study for the @xmath2+jets cross section measurement at atlas  @xcite with @xmath3 of fully - simulated monte carlo data , an integrated luminosity which can be accumulated within the first two years of running .",
    "the goal of the analysis is to test the performance of the lepton and jet triggering and reconstruction algorithms in high jet multiplicity events , to develop the necessary analysis techniques and to evaluate the statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the primary end - results of the analysis are hadron level cross - sections . after a discussion of available tools in the next section ,",
    "techniques used for data analysis are described and a comparison between measurement and theoretical predictions is made .",
    "finally some conclusions are drawn at the end .",
    "the monte carlo data sets used in these studies are generated with alpgen  @xcite interfaced with herwig  @xcite and using the leading order pdf set cteq6ll  @xcite .",
    "the generation is done with a renormalization and factorization scale of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) and the datasets are obtained by merging samples of @xmath2 + n partons ( where n=0 - 5 ) , weighted according to the expected cross - sections and using the mlm  @xcite matching scheme .    for the comparison with the fixed order theoretical predictions , the merged data sets are normalized to the nlo cross - sections .",
    "currently the nlo calculations can only be performed up to @xmath2 + 2 jets , although there is ongoing work for the calculation of 3 jet final states .",
    "nlo is the first order at which the @xmath2 + jets production cross sections have a reliable normalization  @xcite .",
    "cross - sections for @xmath2 + 0 , 1 and 2 ( 3 ) jet final states can be conveniently calculated at lo and nlo ( for @xmath2 + 3 jets lo only ) using the mcfm  @xcite program , and it is from this program that we determine our reference cross - sections .",
    "the mcfm program cross - sections were generated using the cteq6.1 pdfs and a renormalization / factorization scale of @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "pythia  @xcite signal and background samples are generated with version 6.323 using the corresponding atlas underlying - event tune @xcite .",
    "w and z boson final states are selected through their leptonic decays .",
    "events are required to have one or two isolated leptons with transverse momentum @xmath6 above a threshold ( typically 15 - 25 gev ) and lie in the range @xmath7 , excluding the barrel - to - endcap calorimeter crack region ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 boson selection requires two lepton candidates with an invariant mass close to that of the @xmath1 boson mass peak , whereas the @xmath0 boson selection requires a single electron / muon and transverse missing energy above 25 gev .    in this analysis jets",
    "are reconstructed using the standard atlas seeded - cone algorithm with a radius of @xmath9 , built from calorimeter towers and calibrated to the hadron level .",
    "the lepton and jet candidates must be separated by @xmath10 0.4 . it is required that the jet transverse momentum be larger than 40 gev and that the jet be in the range @xmath11 .     and background for jets with transverse momentum @xmath12 gev.,width=302 ]      in the @xmath2 + jets",
    "analysis events are required to pass either double or single isolated lepton trigger .",
    "the trigger efficiencies are evaluated using the data driven tag - and - probe method on @xmath13 events and compared to the monte carlo based method .",
    "good agreement between the two methods is found .",
    "the trigger efficiencies are also studied as a function of the jet multiplicity and overall hadronic activity . in the presence of additional jets in the event ,",
    "leptons are more boosted and the distance between leptons and jets become smaller . as a result , the trigger efficiency is found to decrease due to isolation requirement but the drop in efficiency is almost balanced by the larger acceptance resulting from the boost of leptons in multi - jet environment .",
    "the total reconstruction efficiency ( offline+trigger ) is therefore stable with respect to both the jet multiplicity and the transverse momentum of the leading jet .      for the evaluation of backgrounds to the @xmath2",
    "+ jets different processes with real leptons ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) and qcd multi - jet production are considered .",
    "statistics of the multi - jet background sample are increased by applying a very loose electron selection and then re - weighting the events with the rejection from the final electron identification cuts .",
    "the dominant source of background is the production of qcd multi - jet final states where one or two jet fake a lepton candidate and in the case of @xmath0 boson , a significant mismeasurement of the jet energy results in large missing transverse energy .",
    "the background contamination is at the level of 5 - 15% depending on the jet multiplicity as shown in fig .",
    "[ bkgd : zeejets ] for @xmath17 and in fig .",
    "[ bkgd : wenujets ] for @xmath18 . in both cases",
    "it varies with jet multiplicity . at low multiplicity qcd",
    "multi - jets are the dominant background where @xmath14 dominates at high multiplicity .     and background for jets with transverse momentum @xmath19 20 gev.,width=302 ]",
    "the dominant source of experimental and theoretical uncertainties on all @xmath2 + jets measurements are jet energy scale ( jes ) uncertainties and parton distribution functions ( pdf ) uncertainties , both of which affect signal efficiencies directly .",
    "after careful detector calibration has been applied using sophisticated techniques , some residual jet energy scale uncertainty still arises from the absolute energy correction , underlying event correction and energy outside the reconstructed jet cone .",
    "the jes uncertainty can shift the jet multiplicity spectrum and hence affect the @xmath2 + jets cross - section measurements .",
    "the effect of jes uncertainty on the cross - section measurement is shown in fig .",
    "[ jes : uncertainty ] .",
    "it is clear that the effect due to jes uncertainty is significant .",
    "when the jet energy is miscalibrated by 1% ( which is the design goal of atlas ) the experimental systematic uncertainity on the cross - section remains within 5% , but they increase siginificantly with higher miscalibration .",
    "the pdfs affect any cross - section calculation at the lhc , therefore their knowledge is vital for precise predictions of both standard model and beyond - standard - model processes .",
    "the pdf uncertainties are calculated by applying re - weighting technique .",
    "the alpgen datasets generated with the pdf set cteq6ll are re - weighted to the central value of cteq6 m and the 40 error sets corresponding to the upper and lower uncertainty on each of the 20 eignvectors .",
    "since jets are defined only within certain @xmath20 and @xmath6 ranges , a change in the pdfs modifies the jet distribution as shown in fig .",
    "[ pdf : uncertainty ] .",
    "differential cross - section for different levels of jet energy scale uncertainty.,width=302 ]",
    "the reconstructed data have to be unfolded from the detector level to the particle ( hadron ) level , correcting for efficiency , resolution and non - linearities in electron and jet reconstruction .",
    "the unfolding is very important in order to compare data with theoretical calculation .",
    "the effects of applying correction for the electron reconstruction and trigger efficiency , followed by correction for the jet reconstruction efficiency and jet energy resolution are shown in fig .",
    "[ zee : correction ] . the unfolded data is directly compared to jets formed from generator - level hadrons , after showering but before any detector interaction .",
    "predictions for the inclusive jet cross - sections from the monte carlo generators pythia and alpgen are compared to fixed - order lo and nlo calculations from mcfm partonic level generator .",
    "the nlo mcfm predictions for the @xmath1 + 1 parton and @xmath1 + 2 partons are of the order of 20 to 30% greater than the lo predictions .",
    "the difference between pythia and alpgen , and between both generators and mcfm amounts to 10 - 60% depending on jet multiplicity .",
    "both monte carlo generators predict a lower cross - section than the nlo mcfm caluclation for final states with more than one jet .",
    "pythia predicts a larger @xmath1 + 1 jets cross - section than alpgen but also predicts a lower average jet multiplicity .",
    "the difference between pythia and alpgen depends very much on the minimum jet @xmath6 required by the selection .",
    "pythia predicts larger cross - section than even nlo mcfm for low jet @xmath6 . while the jet @xmath6 distribution predicted by alpgen agrees well with the nlo mcfm predictions , pythia generates a clearly softer @xmath6 spectrum .",
    "distribution from @xmath21 events due to pdf uncertainties.,width=302 ]     channel for electron reconstruction and trigger efficiency as well as corrections for the jet reconstruction efficiency and energy resolution.,width=302 ]",
    "final states containing @xmath2 + jets will serve as one of the standard model benchmarks for physics analysis at the lhc while probing new qcd regimes .",
    "we have considered cross - section measurements for theoretically well - defined quantities such as the inclusive @xmath1 + jets cross section , and the jet transverse momentum for leading and next - to - leading jets .",
    "preliminary studies have identified major sources of background and sources of systematic uncertainty in the cross - section measurements .",
    "comparisons to theoretical predictions at the next - to - leading order level are facilitated by the experimental unfolding technique , which allows comparison at particle ( hadron ) level .",
    "the dominant systematic error is expected to be the uncertainty on the jet energy scale .",
    "it has been shown that for jet energy scale uncertainty of 5 - 10% , the uncertainities on cross - section could be as large as 20 - 30% which is at the same order as the typical differences expected between lo and nlo predictions or between predictions from pythia , alpgen and mcfm .",
    "the atlas goal is to keep jet energy scale uncertainty within 1 - 2% , hence uncertainties on cross - section would remain with 5% .",
