    "to explore the formation and the evolution of the present - day `` normal '' galaxies like our galaxy , it is important to characterize where and how star formation occurs in a galaxy . in the local universe , it is well known that star formation rate ( sfr ) correlates with dust opacity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , where intensely star - forming regions and galaxies are obscured by a huge amount of dust , and become optically thick ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the uv continuum emission and hydrogen recombination lines in the optical ranges such as h@xmath3 at 0.6563 @xmath2 m and h@xmath8 at 0.4861 @xmath2 m emitted from those dusty star - forming regions are easily attenuated , and then it would be complicated to correctly understand the distribution of star - forming regions in the whole galaxy , especially when the galaxy has a patchy distribution of dust ( @xcite ) .    on the other hand , paschen-@xmath3 ( pa@xmath3 ) at 1.8571 @xmath2 m ( in air ; 1.8756 @xmath2 m in vacuum ) , the strongest emission line in the near - infrared ( nir , @xmath9 @xmath6 0.82.5 @xmath2 m ) wavelength range , is less affected by dust thanks to its longer wavelength than the optical lines ( @xcite ) , and becomes a powerful and direct indicator of sfr , especially in dusty regions .",
    "in particular , the observed pa@xmath3 emission becomes stronger than h@xmath3 at @xmath10 1.2 ( @xmath11 3.7 ) and than br@xmath12 at @xmath13 28.0 ( @xmath14 86.2 ) with an assumption of a milky - way - like extinction curve and @xmath15 3.08 ( @xcite ) , while the intrinsic pa@xmath3 luminosity is 0.12 of h@xmath3 , 2.14 of pa@xmath8 ( 1.2818 @xmath2 m in air ) , and 12.4 of br@xmath12 ( 2.1655 @xmath2 m in air ) for case b recombination with an electron temperature of @xmath16 k and density of @xmath16 @xmath17 ( @xcite ) .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure01.eps    however , pa@xmath3 observations from the ground have been quite difficult so far due to deep atmospheric absorption features around their wavelength , mostly caused by water vapor , and hence most pa@xmath3 observational studies have been limited to those by near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos , @xcite ) on board the _ hubble _ space telescope ( _ hst _ ) . for example , @xcite use the nicmos pa@xmath3 narrow - band ( f187n and f190n ) imaging data to study star formation properties of dusty star - forming galaxies in the local universe with a high spatial resolution , and find the compact distributions of pa@xmath3 emission along various galaxy structures such as nucleus and spiral arm .",
    "they also establish a linear empirical relation between pa@xmath3 and 24 @xmath2 m luminosity as well as the total infrared luminosity as an indicator of sfr for those galaxies .",
    "in addition , a wide - field pa@xmath3 imaging survey of the galactic center ( @xcite ; @xcite ) produces a high spatial - resolution map of stars and an ionized diffuse gas with a possible new class of massive stars not associated with any known star clusters .",

    "as described above , pa@xmath3 observations are quite useful for a variety of targets obscured by dust and can provide a new insight into those studies , yet the amount of observing time and facilities available for that purpose are still very limited .",

    "it should be noted that , although there is several night - sky oh emission lines within the bandpasses of the nb filters ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we consider their influence on our result to be small because we perform aperture photometry with _",

    "star - forming regions associated with the spiral arm and the nucleus are clearly seen . for a comparison of its sensitivity , the same galaxy taken by the _",
    "f190n filter is also shown in the right - hand panel of figure [ fig : lirg_paa ] , from which the f187n image is subtracted as a continuum emission .",
    "a quantitative comparison confirms the consistency of pa@xmath3 fluxes obtained with anir and nicmos within an accuracy of 10% ( @xcite ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for the data reduction processes , verification , quantitative analyses , and comparison of the performance with nicmos , of pa@xmath3 emission line data taken by the @xmath51875 and @xmath5191 filters .",
    "finally , we evaluate how the site is suitable for the infrared astronomy in terms of pwv by using the @xmath51875 and @xmath5191 data taken between 2009 and 2011 .",
    "we note that our approach using the nb filters around 1.9 @xmath2 m which are sensitive to pwv is independent of any previous studies carried out at ( the vicinity of ) the chajnantor plateau ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the throughputs derived in section [ sect : throughput ] ( hereafter @xmath57 ) consist of the following factors : ( i ) the reflectivity of the telescope mirrors ( @xmath58 ) , ( ii ) the system efficiency of anir excluding the filter transmittance ( @xmath59 ) , ( iii ) the filter transmittance ( @xmath60 ) , ( iv ) atmospheric transmittance ( @xmath61 ) at the zenith which is dependent on pwv .",
    "then , the throughput is described as : @xmath62 where the superscript `` band '' denotes that the factor depends on the wavelength measured and @xmath63 is the airmass which is necessary for considering the optical path length of the atmosphere during the observation .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume a homogeneous atmosphere in terms of airmass to obtain the atmospheric transmittance at a given airmass by scaling that at the airmass of 1.0 .",
    "in fact , such a simple scaling tends to overestimate the atmospheric extinction at @xmath63 @xmath64 1 due to the non - linear dependence of the amount of extinction on airmass ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the resultant quantities , @xmath65 and pwv , are considered to be lower and upper limits , respectively .",
    "@xmath60 is measured at 77 k in the laboratory ( table [ tab : spec_nir_nb ] ) .",
    "we calculate @xmath61 using the atran model . as the atmospheric transmittances at the @xmath20 and @xmath21-bands",
    "are largely independent regardless of pwv ( see figure [ fig : atran_nir ] ) , the factor @xmath66 can be calculated , for example , for the @xmath21-band as the following : @xmath67 in the same way , we calculate the factor for the @xmath20-band ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "since the factor for the @xmath20-band is much the same as that for the @xmath21-band with a dispersion of a few percent , indicating that the factor has small dependence on wavelength , we then interpolate @xmath68 and @xmath69 to estimate the same factor for a nb filter ( @xmath51875 or @xmath5191 ) , @xmath70 . finally , we obtain pwv by iteratively calculating the left - hand integral in equation ( [ eq : integral ] ) within the bandpass [ @xmath71 , @xmath72 of the nb filter with changing pwv to make it equal to the right - hand value .",
    "@xmath73    ( 85mm,85mm)figure12a.eps ( 85mm,85mm)figure12b.eps    the evaluated pwv values and the corresponding atmospheric transmittances at the @xmath51875 ( @xmath5191 ) filter are shown in the left- and right - hand ordinates of figure [ fig : pwv_comp]a ( [ fig : pwv_comp]b ) , respectively .",
    "each data point is calculated by using a reduced and combined nb image of several dithering frames which has a total integration time of @xmath6 1200 s. the vertical error bars include in quadrature ( i ) the 1@xmath74 uncertainty of the throughput of the nb data and ( ii ) frame - by - frame fluctuations of the throughput in the same dithering sequence .",
    "we evaluate the latter factor by processing individual frames in the same manner as described above for two objects : one with a higher ( @xmath6 0.8 mm ) and another with a lower ( @xmath6 0.2 mm ) pwv evaluated from their stacked image .",
    "we find a frame - by - frame fluctuation of about 0.14 mm for both objects , and we thus introduce a constant factor of 0.14 mm as the frame - by - frame fluctuation for all the data in figure [ fig : pwv_comp ] .",
    "our result tends to show lower pwv values ( the median and its 1@xmath74 dispersion are 0.40 @xmath7 0.30 for @xmath51875 and 0.37 @xmath7 0.21 mm for @xmath5191 ) than those reported previously ( i.e. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this may be partly because our observations have been carried out mostly in may and october , when the climate is expected to be drier than the yearly mean .",
    "note that the effect of the airmass has been corrected in figure [ fig : pwv_comp ] , so that the dispersion of each measurement of pwv is likely to be caused by the temporal fluctuation in the atmospheric absorption .    for a quantitative comparison of the result ,",
    "we use archival pwv data measured by a radiometer of atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex , @xcite ) located near the base of cerro chajnantor at an altitude of 5,100 m. we extract the apex pwv data during our @xmath51875 ( @xmath5191 ) observations , which are plotted along the abscissa in figure [ fig : pwv_comp]a ( [ fig : pwv_comp]b ) .",
    "the error bars represent 1@xmath74 dispersion of the extracted apex pwv during our observations ( @xmath6 1200 s per object ) .",
    "we clearly see that the pwv evaluated at the tao site is remarkably lower ( the median ratio and its 1@xmath74 dispersion are 49% @xmath7 38% for @xmath51875 and 59% @xmath7 26% for @xmath5191 ) than those measured at the apex site . a simple linear fit through the origin to the distribution yields a slope of 0.47 for @xmath51875 and 0.60 for @xmath5191 ( the _ dotted _ line in figure [ fig : pwv_comp ] ) .",
    "let us now consider the vertical distribution of the water vapor to discuss possible causes of the difference in the pwv between the apex ( pwv@xmath75 ) and the tao ( pwv@xmath76 ) sites .",
    "when the water vapor is assumed to be distributed exponentially , pwv is derived by integrating an exponential profile , @xmath77@xmath78@xmath79 $ ] , over altitude @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the water vapor density ( in kg m@xmath82 ) at a given altitude @xmath80 above sea level ( in km ) , @xmath83 the density at a reference altitude @xmath84 , @xmath85 the scale height at which the water vapor density decreases by a factor of @xmath86 .",
    "@xcite have measured the vertical distribution of the water vapor above the chajnantor plateau by a combination of radiometric ( at both 183 and 225 ghz ) and radiosonde measurements , and derived the median scale height @xmath85 @xmath6 1.13 km by fitting the individual distributions to the exponential profile with @xmath84 of 5.0 km ( i.e. , chajnantor plateau ) . by using a scale height of 1.13 km ,",
    "the pwv at the tao site is calculated for a given pwv at the apex site , as follows ( see also , ) .",
    "the density @xmath83 is found by integrating the above equation above 5,100 m since the integral equals to the pwv at the apex site .",
    "for example , the pwv at the apex site of 1.0 mm leads to @xmath87 1.44 g @xmath17 .",
    "then , the pwv at the tao site is derived , to be @xmath6 0.62 mm in the case of the example , by integrating the equation above 5,640 m with @xmath83 substituted . using the measurements of the exponential scale height at night time ( the peak - to - peak values in @xmath85 of @xmath6 0.31.9 km ) by @xcite",
    ", we derive the corresponding pwv values at the tao site as a function of the pwv at the apex site , which are shown in figure [ fig : pwv_comp ] with a _ shaded _ region .",
    "we find that almost all of the data points are in excellent agreement , within the uncertainties , with the expectation of such exponential distributions of the water vapor having the measured scale heights .",
    "note that there are a few outliers above the region , which might be caused by liquid phase of water ( fog or clouds ) in the atmosphere which is not detected by the apex radiometer operating at 183 ghz , as suggested by previous studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we should also note the possible influence of the presence of temperature inversion layers on the water vapor distribution .",
    "@xcite find that their radiosonde data often show temperature inversions which make the distribution far from the exponential shape , so that much of the water vapor would be trapped below the inversion layers . to explore",
    "the influence requires a large sample of radiosonde data ( or any equivalent data on the vertical distributions of the water vapor ) and it is far beyond the scope of this paper , but we consider that our conclusion of the advantage of the site remains unrevised , because temperature inversions often take place below the altitude of 5,500 m at night time ( @xcite ) , indicating systematically lower pwv content at the tao site than at the apex site , which is qualitatively the same trend as derived from figure [ fig : pwv_comp ] .    while there is relatively large uncertainties in our analysis , it is encouraging to see that the low pwv content at the tao site is confirmed by independent methods ( i.e. , nb imaging and radiosonde ) , which suggests that the tao site at the summit of cerro chajnantor is suitable for infrared astronomy , and in particular that minitao / anir has an excellent capability for pa@xmath3 observations at around @xmath4 1.9 @xmath2 m .",
    "we have developed a near - infrared camera , anir ( atacama nir camera ) , for the 1.0-m minitao telescope installed at the summit of cerro chajnantor ( an altitude of 5,640 m ) in northern chile .",
    "the camera covers a field of view of @xmath0 with a spatial resolution of pixel@xmath1 in the wavelength range of 0.95 to 2.4 @xmath2 m .",
    "the unique feature of the camera coupled with advantages of the site is a capability of narrow - band imaging observations of a strong hydrogen emission line , paschen-@xmath3 ( pa@xmath3 ) , at @xmath4 1.8751 @xmath2 m from the ground , at which wavelength it has been quite difficult to conduct ground - based observations so far due to deep atmospheric absorption mostly from water vapor .",
    "we have been successfully obtaining pa@xmath3 images of galactic objects and nearby galaxies since the first light observation with anir in 2009 .",
    "the throughputs at the narrow - band filters ( @xmath51875 and @xmath5191 ) show larger dispersion ( @xmath6 10% ) than those of the broad - band filters ( a few percent ) , indicating that they are affected by temporal fluctuations in precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) above the site . combining the atmospheric transmission model with the throughputs",
    ", we evaluated the atmospheric transmittance at the narrow - band filters and the pwv content at the site .",
    "we find that the median and the dispersion of the pwv are 0.40 @xmath7 0.30 for @xmath51875 and 0.37 @xmath7 0.21 mm for @xmath5191 data .",
    "comparing those data with the radiometer data taken by apex , we find that the site has remarkably lower ( 49% @xmath7 38% for @xmath51875 and 59% @xmath7 26% for @xmath5191 ) pwv values than the apex site ( 5,100 m ) .",
    "the differences in pwv between those sites are found to be in excellent agreement with those expected from the exponential distribution of the water vapor with scale height within 0.31.9 km which has been measured using the radiosonde at night time ( @xcite ) .",
    "although temperature inversions ( which mostly take place below the summit at night - time ) make the water vapor distribution far from exponential , it leads to lower pwv content above the inversion layers , which is qualitatively consistent with our findings described above . taken all together",
    ", we conclude that minitao / anir and the site , the summit of cerro chajnantor , provides us with an excellent capability for _ ground - based _ pa@xmath3 observations .",
