    "bosonic atoms confined in optical lattices have proved to be a unique laboratory for investigating quantum phase transitions from superfluids to mott insulators @xcite .",
    "the momentum distribution of a lattice system can be mapped out directly by the interference pattern of the atomic cloud after a ballistic expansion over a time of flight ( tof ) . the emergence of macroscopic bosonic superfluid is usually identified by the appearance of interference peaks .",
    "however , recent theoretical works @xcite for homogeneous gases in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) lattice showed that this criterion of macroscopic superfluidity is not reliable since even a normal gas can have sharp interference peaks .",
    "the underlying physical picture is that a lattice system at finite temperatures possesses a ",
    "v - shaped \" phase diagram @xcite which includes a normal gas region between the mott insulator and the superfluid .",
    "the true signature of macroscopic superfluidity is the @xmath2-function momentum peaks with nearly unit visibility @xcite .",
    "below critical temperature , the coexistence of superfluid and normal gas in the homogeneous lattice system should give rise to an interference pattern having a feature of  peak on a peak \" @xcite .",
    "the new criterion of macroscopic superfluidity makes it necessary to further investigate the phase transition of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice , particularly for the characteristics associated with the critical temperature and interference patterns .",
    "experimental investigations are also required for comparison with relevant theoretical models .",
    "there have been a few theoretical works @xcite considering the translationally invariant ( uniform ) lattices .",
    "however , in a realistic experiment , an optical lattice is always accompanied by harmonic confinement in all dimensions , arising from the focused gaussian laser beams and/or an external magnetic trap .",
    "a bosonic gas is , therefore , never spatially uniform over the lattice range .",
    "et al_. @xcite have examined the critical temperature of the interacting bosons in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice with additional harmonic confinement .",
    "et al_. @xcite have investigated the condensate fraction and specific heat of non - interacting bosons in 1d , two - dimensional ( 2d ) , and 3d lattices in the presence of harmonic potentials .",
    "based on a piecewise analytic density of states extended to excited bands , blakie _",
    "et al_. @xcite developed an analytical expression of the critical temperature for an ideal bosonic gas in the combined harmonic lattice potential , and compared the analytic result with their numerical computations .",
    "however , these studies on combined traps did not mention interference patterns of the released bosonic gases .",
    "a more recent theoretical paper @xcite has investigated the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in a 3d inhomogeneous optical lattice system , and predicted that a bimodal structure in the momentum - space density profile is a universal indicator of bec transition .    the experiment of spielman _",
    "et al_. @xcite has examined the superfluid to normal transition for a finite - sized 2d optical lattice system .",
    "their measurements confirm that bimodal momentum distributions are associated with the superfluid phase .",
    "for such a system with a typical density of @xmath3 atom per lattice site , the phase transition behavior can be interpreted in terms of the commonly used bose - hubbard model .    unlike the 2d and 3d cases , an inhomogeneous 1d optical lattice system is usually much more heavily populated , with an atomic number up to several hundreds in a single lattice site . in the superfluid phase ,",
    "the on - site interaction energy @xmath4 varies from site to site because of its dependence on the local population in single lattice sites .",
    "this increases the complexity in searching for an analytical description of the phase transition . in this paper",
    "we present a study of the critical temperature and interference patterns of an ultracold bosonic gas confined by a 1d optical lattice and an additional magnetic potential .",
    "the interference patterns of the normal gas and the condensed atoms are treated separately .",
    "the superposition of the two parts gives rise to a feature of  peak on a peak . \"",
    "different from a homogeneous lattice system , however , the normal gas can - not produce sharp interference peaks .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical results are compared with our preliminary experiment for a 1d lattice system of @xmath1rb bose - einstein condensates .",
    "our theoretical model relevant to the phase transition is for ideal bosonic gases .",
    "in fact , interatomic interaction may affect the shape of the interference pattern , especially for the condensed part which has a higher atomic density . in order to obtain a better match with the experiment result",
    ", we take the interaction energy into consideration for the condensed atoms during the time of flight .",
    "the computed result shows that interference peaks arising from the condensed atoms can be significantly broadened due to the interaction effect .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ critical temperature ] , we begin with a semiclassical energy spectrum for a combined harmonic lattice trap . under the tight - binding approximation and in the low energy limit , we derive an analytical expression of the critical temperature for the atoms condensed to a superfluid state .",
    "the accuracy of the analytical results are checked with respect to the numerical calculations .",
    "section [ peaks ] gives a description on how the interference patterns are calculated for the normal gas , as well as the bose - condensed gas . in sec .",
    "[ experiment ] , we briefly introduce the experiment , and present the observed interference patterns for a comparison with our theoretical results . finally in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] , we summarize the obtained results .",
    "we now consider an ideal bose gas confined in a 3d harmonic potential with axial symmetry around the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the axial and transverse trapping frequencies are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "moreover , we assume that the axial confinement is much weaker than the radial confinement ( @xmath8 ) , so that the bose gas is made cigar - shaped .",
    "a 1d optical lattice potential , @xmath9 , is applied along the @xmath5 axis , where @xmath10 is the wave vector of the lattice light , @xmath11 denotes the lattice period , and @xmath12 denotes the potential depth of the lattice .",
    "@xmath12 can be written in terms of the recoil energy @xmath13 , say , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the atomic mass .",
    "the harmonic potential , together with the optical lattice , forms a combined trap written as @xmath17 in practice , an optical lattice is usually produced by a retro - reflected gaussian laser beam which also produces a transverse confining potential , that can be simply absorbed into @xmath18 if it is non - negligible .    to obtain the eigenenergies of the combined trap system",
    ", one needs to derive the single - particle hamiltonian of the system and then numerically diagonalize it @xcite . despite its accuracy for ideal bose gases , this numerical method can not provide an analytic expression of the energy levels .",
    "the energy spectrum corresponding to the transverse confinement is described by equally spaced harmonic - oscillator states , whereas the oscillator treatment is not applicable to the axial dimension due to the presence of the optical lattice .",
    "our discussion hereafter is based on the tight - binding approximation that only the ground band is accessible to the system .",
    "this approximation is valid when the thermal energy of the atoms is much less than the first band gap of a deep lattice . for a 1d uniform lattice ,",
    "the eigen energy can be written as a function of quasimomentum @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 . here",
    ", @xmath21 is the frequency of the local oscillation at each lattice well , while @xmath22 is the tunneling energy due to the hopping to a nearest neighboring well , and it depends upon the lattice depth @xmath23 in the following form @xcite @xmath24 it should be noted that eq . is valid only for deep lattices . at @xmath25 ,",
    "for example , it overestimates @xmath22 by approximately @xmath26 . for the combined trap",
    ", it is a reasonable assumption that eq . remains valid as long as the trapping frequency @xmath6 of the weak axial confinement is much smaller than the tunneling rate @xmath27 .",
    "we are thus able to use a constant @xmath22 over the entire lattice system at a given lattice depth . for simplicity",
    "the energy spectrum corresponding to the combined confinement in the axial direction is approximated by the semiclassical energy , @xmath28 , in the @xmath5-@xmath29 phase space , where @xmath29 is the quasimomentum in the ground band .",
    "now we are able to write the total energy spectrum in an explicit form @xmath30 where @xmath31 are non - negative integers .    for a semiclassical description of this system",
    ", we treat the harmonic trap semiclassically while treating the optical lattice quantum mechanically .",
    "such a picture corresponds to a density distribution of the thermal cloud : @xmath32 where @xmath33 - 1 } , \\ ] ] and @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the normalized wave function of a uniform optical lattice system with an extension of @xmath36 lattice sites , and @xmath37 is the wannier wave function .",
    "the total number of thermal atoms is then written as @xmath38 in the tight - binding limit , @xmath39 is well localized within a single lattice site . in contrast , @xmath40 is a slowly varying function of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 in eq .",
    "can be integrated out .",
    "this results in a new integrand expressed as a summation of discrete @xmath42 , which in turn can be approximated as an integral over @xmath5 . by doing so",
    ", one gets @xmath43    below a critical temperature @xmath0 the chemical potential @xmath44 of the bose gas reaches the bottom of the ground band @xmath45 while the lowest state with @xmath46 becomes macroscopically populated which corresponds to the onset of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the condensed atoms exhibit macroscopic superfluidity , whereas all other atoms beyond the lowest state form a so - called normal gas .",
    "since the condensate is actually a quantum fluid , we use  superfluid \" just as a synonym of bec .",

    "the integrand can be expanded in powers of the exponential term using the formula @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , the sum over @xmath53 , @xmath54 can be replaced by an integral if the atomic number @xmath48 is large . performing the integration over @xmath53 , @xmath54 as well as that over the coordinate @xmath5 , one gets @xmath55 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] and the right side is a function of temperature @xmath56 . apparently , eq . is suitable for numerical calculation of the atomic number in the normal gas since the integration can be simply replaced by a summation over the @xmath29 region .    by imposing that @xmath57 at the transition , eq . determines a critical temperature @xmath0 for a given @xmath48 .",
    "apparently , to obtain the value of @xmath0 , one needs to carry out numerical computations based on eq . .",
    "nevertheless , we can derive an analytic expression of @xmath0 in a limiting case .",
    "when the temperature of the bose gas is so low that most atoms occupy the states in the vicinity of the bottom of the ground band , the relation @xmath58 holds , and the cosine function in eq . can be expanded to the order of @xmath59 . with the @xmath29-dependent function integrated out , one has @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the geometric average of the trapping frequencies , @xmath62 the effective mass of the atom , and @xmath63 the riemann zeta function .",
    "finally , one gets @xmath64 which can be used as an analytic estimation of the critical temperature .     versus the total number of @xmath65 atoms .",

    "we recall that an ideal bose gas trapped in a 3d harmonic potential undergoes the phase transition to bose - einstein condensation at a temperature @xcite @xmath70 . comparing this expression with eq .",
    ", one can see that @xmath0 is changed by a factor of @xmath71 due to the presence of the 1d lattice .",
    "since @xmath72 is always larger than @xmath16 @xcite under tight - binding approximation , the combined trap @xmath0 is actually reduced compared to the case without lattice .",
    "note also that a homogeneous 3d lattice system has a reduced @xmath0 as well @xcite , but with a reducing factor @xmath73 instead .",
    "we have calculated the critical temperature @xmath0 for a @xmath1rb gas in the combined trap ( see fig .",

    "we have also calculated the condensate fraction for our combined trap system with @xmath80 atoms , as shown by the solid line in fig .",

    "clearly , our semiclassical treatment agrees with the full numerical method , and proves to be reliable .",

    "the  peak on a peak \" features of interference patterns were confirmed by the measured linear densities of expanded atomic clouds in many runs of experiments .",
    "the black curves in figs . [ measuredpattern](a)-[measuredpattern](c ) display three typical density distributions which were obtained by integrating the pixels in each column of the corresponding absorption image .",
    "the calculated critical temperature @xmath0 is usually in the order of several tens of @xmath220 .",
    "in contrast , during the evaporative cooling stage , the critical temperature for condensation in the quic trap is much higher ( @xmath221 ) .",
    "actually , the experiment reported in @xcite showed clearly a significantly decreased critical temperature for a combined trap when compared with a purely magnetic trap .",
    "the black curve is the integration along the axial direction of the central peak .",
    "the gray curve is a bimodal fitting of the black curve , which represents a superposition of a gaussian profile and a thomas - fermi profile ( inverted parabola ) .",
    "the rms size of the gaussian part gives a temperature of @xmath222 .",
    "( inset ) the absorption image of this atomic cloud . ]    to test our theory , the temperature of the atomic sample before expansion must be known .",
    "it can be deduced from the transverse distribution of the normal gas after the tof , which should take a gaussian profile due to the initially thermal occupation of the transverse modes . since the condensate part should take a thomas - fermi profile in the transverse direction , a bimodal transverse distribution is expected for a released gas , just as shown in fig .",
    "[ transverse ] .",
    "however , a measured temperature based on this method usually has a large uncertainty due to the following reasons .",
    "first , in the transverse direction , the spatial extent of the condensate is not very distinct from that of the normal gas , especially when the condensate fraction is large .",
    "second , the normal gas density profile deviates from an ideal gaussian shape , and exhibits a slight asymmetry that may arise from the misalignment between the lattice light and the magnetic trap .",
    "third , the optical noise in the absorption images also lowers the fitting accuracy .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , an atomic sample can be significantly heated or cooled when adiabatically loaded to an optical lattice . yet , to date",
    ", we have no alternative methods for accurate measurement of the temperature of an atomic sample confined in a lattice system .",
    "we have to treat temperature as a fitting parameter in the calculation , so that the calculated density distribution most closely reproduces the experimental curve .",
    "the gray curves in fig .",
    "[ measuredpattern ] are the calculated density distributions of cold rubidium gases .",
    "figure [ measuredpattern](a ) is a case with a smaller atom number , and the fitting curve agrees fairly well with the experimental data .",
    "figure [ measuredpattern](b ) displays the interference pattern of another atomic sample initially confined in a deeper lattice , and the side peaks are more prominent . as a comparison , the atomic sample in fig .",
    "[ measuredpattern](c ) contains more atoms and the lattice depth was further increased .",
    "accordingly , the calculated @xmath0 shifts up to @xmath223 . since the normal gas density is increased , the feature of  peak on a peak \" is more pronounced . in ( b ) and",
    "( c ) , we also plot the density distributions calculated using the measured temperature values .",
    "the larger deviation from the measured density profiles should be attributed to the inaccuracy of temperature .    despite the overall agreement between the theoretical and experimental curves in fig .",
    "[ measuredpattern ] , there are still noticeable discrepancies . as the lattice depth increases ,",
    "theoretical normal gas peaks become broader than the measured density profiles . as shown in fig .",
    "[ measuredpattern](d ) , the gray line does not match the black curve , particularly at the wings of the normal gas .",
    "for this atomic sample , the temperature is close to @xmath0 , and the condensate peaks are hence very small .",
    "the mismatch between the theory and experiment indicates that our model is not valid for very deep optical lattices .",
    "this can be easily understood by comparing the tunneling energy @xmath22 to the energy offset between adjacent lattice sites induced by harmonic - potential . for a cloud with an extension of @xmath224 ,",
    "this energy offset is @xmath225 at the site of @xmath226 .",
    "a typical value of @xmath227 corresponds to an energy offset of @xmath228 , whereas @xmath22 decreases with increased lattice depth . for @xmath229 as in fig .",
    "[ measuredpattern](d ) , @xmath230 .",
    "when @xmath22 gets smaller than the energy offset between adjacent lattice sites , normal gas atoms are essentially localized and the semiclassical analysis breaks down .",
    "we have also calculated the @xmath0 s for situations of @xmath231 , using the diagonalization method and semiclassical approximation , respectively .",
    "we do find significant discrepancy between the predictions of these two methods .",
    "in such situations , an atomic cloud should be treated as a chain of separate condensates , where the loss of condensate is interpreted as the loss of well - to - well phase coherence @xcite . at a depth level of @xmath232",
    ", we observed a completely disappearance of interference peaks .",
    "on the other hand , in our model , the interatomic interactions during tof are taken into account for the subcondensates individually .",
    "this amounts to neglecting the variation of the wavefunction modulus induced by the interactions between subcondensates .",
    "the fluctuations of the wavefunction modulus are related to the relative phase of the subcondensates , and hence affect their phase coherence , leading to variations of the interference peak of the condensates .",
    "evidently , the calculated condensate peaks are slightly wider than the measured ones ( see fig . [ measuredpattern ] ) .",
    "perhaps , the neglected interactions are favorable for establishing a uniform phase which partially cancels the phase nonuniformity discussed in sec . [ condensed gas ] .",
    "since we have not found a simple model to account for it , this effect will not be discussed in detail in this paper .",
    "we have performed a study , both theoretically and experimentally , on the phase transition to macroscopic superfluidity for a bose gas confined in a combined trap formed by a harmonic potential and an optical lattice .",
    "we have mainly investigated the interference patterns of the bose gases below the critical temperature . by using a semiclassical energy spectrum and tight - binding approximation ,",
    "we have derived an analytical approximation of the critical temperature which is applicable to an atomic gas residing in the vicinity of the bottom of the ground bloch band .",
    "furthermore , the interference patterns of the normal gas and the condensed gas were analyzed separately .",
    "we have derived the analytical expressions of the atomic density distribution for the released normal gas and condensed gas which has experienced a free expansion over a time of flight .",
    "our calculation results show that a condensed gas is characterized by fully - resolved narrow interference peaks while a normal gas forms broad interference peaks with lower visibility . for comparison",
    ", we have performed a preliminary experiment using bose - einstein condensates of @xmath1rb atoms .",
    "the combined trap system was implemented by applying a 1d optical lattice to a magnetically trapped condensate .",
    "the measured interference pattern agrees essentially with our theoretical prediction , exhibiting ",
