    "the guided - mode resonance  @xcite in grating waveguide structures can lead to a rapid spectral variation ( which has found application in devices such as optical filters  @xcite ) and a local enhanced electromagnetic field ( which can be useful for enhancing light - matter interactions  @xcite and fluorescence emission  @xcite ) .",
    "the resonance occurs at wavelengths where an evanescent diffraction order is resonantly coupled to a guided mode ( or a leaky mode ) of the photonic gratings , and so the intensity of the corresponding diffracted wave decreases exponentially as it propagates away from the grating .",
    "the spatial localization of the evanescent wave means that devices which rely on a high - field intensity must be operated inside or in the vicinity of the resonant grating . in some cases",
    "( an example will be discussed below ) , it may be desirable to have a resonant grating where the enhanced field remains strong beyond the near - field",
    ". this can be possible if the diffraction order , which is resonantly coupled to a grating mode , is a propagating order or a weakly evanescent order .",
    "a weakly evanescent diffraction order can exist near a rayleigh anomaly ( also called wood anomaly ) , where the transition from a propagating order to an evanescent order takes place .",
    "a propagating diffracted field of order @xmath0 can also have a much larger amplitude ( i.e. , a large diffraction coefficient @xmath1 ) than the incident wave when it is close to a rayleigh anomaly .",
    "indeed , if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are respectively the angle of incidence and the angle of diffraction , the diffraction efficiency @xmath4 is less than or equal to one , so that we have @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that @xmath6 can potentially takes large values when @xmath3 is near @xmath7 ( grazing angle of diffraction ) , which means that the diffraction order is close to a rayleigh anomaly .",
    "the high - intensity diffracted field , which can occur at a grazing angle of diffraction , can be interpreted as a spatial compression of the incident wave .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spatial : compression ] where , for an incidence over a grating of length @xmath8 , the ratio of the width of a diffracted plane wave emerging from the grating to the width of the incident plane wave is equal to @xmath9 .",
    "the observations in the previous paragraph suggest that a propagating diffracted wave ( or a weakly evanescent diffracted wave ) with enhanced field can be obtained when a grating waveguide resonance and a rayleigh anomaly coexist . in this work , by conceptualizing a photonic crystal slab as a perturbation to a uniform dielectric film , we show that the properties of the fabry - perot resonance can be used to design photonic crystal slabs that can diffract a substantially enhanced field into non - specular orders which are either propagating or weakly evanescent . the fabry - perot model for uniform dielectric films",
    "can also be used to accurately predict ( especially for photonic crystal slabs with a low index contrast ) the location of the resonance wavelength of a photonic crystal slab .",
    "this work is partly motivated by the fact that photonic crystal slabs can be found on the cell wall ( frustule ) of some unicellular photosynthetic organisms known as diatoms  @xcite .",
    "the biological function of these periodic photonic structures is not well understood yet  @xcite , although it has been reported  @xcite that high intensity light can induce a movement of the photosynthetic units ( chloroplasts ) away from the cell wall toward the cell center while a weak light can induce a movement toward the cell wall .",
    "this may suggest that the photonic crystal slabs in the diatom frustule can enhance the intensity of an incident light . in this work",
    "we will carry out some numerical simulations of a photonic crystal slab described in  @xcite , in order to verify if it can provide an efficient field enhancement .",
    "in such a case , an enhanced field which is propagating or weakly evanescent can be beneficial since the chloroplasts is not in a direct contact with the frustule , which is located outside the cell membrane .",
    "the combination of a rayleigh anomaly with another optical resonance effect has been previously studied , especially for the purpose of improving the transmission efficiency .",
    "the coupling of a rayleigh anomaly with a surface plasmon polariton  @xcite or a fabry - perot resonance  @xcite has been applied to improve the transmission efficiency through metallo - dielectric gratings .",
    "optical transmission filters with a sharp peak and an improved efficiency have also been demonstrated for dielectric gratings where a guided - mode resonance and a rayleigh anomaly coexist  @xcite . in what follows , the principles behind the design of resonant photonic crystal slabs will be explained . in section  [ section : r : t : pcs ] , we will give some details on the numerical method used for the calculation of reflection and transmission through a photonic crystal slab ; an effective medium technique will also be presented .",
    "the numerical simulation results of some examples of photonic crystal slabs will be given in the following section .",
    "finally , in section  [ section : applications ] , we will discuss some potential applications of the resonant photonic crystal slabs .",
    ", the width of the incident plane wave and a diffracted plane wave are respectively @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "there is a spatial compression of the incident plane wave if @xmath12 , i.e. , if @xmath13.,width=226 ]    , @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent respectively the incident , reflected and transmitted fields.,width=188 ]",
    "the design is based on the following principles .",
    "first , we consider the problem of plane wave incidence from a semi - infinite medium ( 0 ) of refractive index @xmath16 into a semi - infinite medium ( 1 ) of refractive index @xmath17 .",
    "an illustration of this fresnel scattering problem is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interface ] .",
    "the media ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) are assumed to be lossless , i.e. , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are real numbers ; we also suppose that @xmath18 . the wavelength of the incident field is denoted @xmath19 . for an incidence by a te - polarized ( or @xmath20-polarized ) plane wave ,",
    "the reflection coefficient @xmath14 and transmission coefficient @xmath15 are  @xcite : @xmath21 while for an incidence by a tm - polarized ( or @xmath22-polarized ) plane wave , we have @xmath23 the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 in eqs .",
    "( [ te : rho01:tau01 ] ) and ( [ tm : rho01:tau01 ] ) are defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the free space wavenumber . for both te and tm polarizations , the transmission coefficient @xmath15 tends to zero as the angle of incidence @xmath2 approaches the right angle .",
    "this poor transmission can be explained by the fact that , at a grazing angle of incidence , the wavevector in the incident medium is almost tangential to the interface while it can still have a significant normal component in the transmission medium ( from snell s law , the angle of refraction @xmath29 converges to @xmath30 when the angle of incidence @xmath2 approaches the right angle ) . by definition ,",
    "the electric field of a te - polarized plane wave and the magnetic field of a tm - polarized plane wave are tangential to the interface .",
    "so when the wavevector in the incident medium is almost tangential to the interface , the magnetic field of a te - polarized plane wave and the electric field of a tm - polarized plane wave are almost perpendicular to the interface , i.e. , these fields have a relatively small tangential component .",
    "but both the electric field and the magnetic of field , of the corresponding plane wave in the transmission medium , can still have a significant tangential component .",
    "this field mismatch results in the poor transmittance at a grazing angle of incidence .",
    "we recall that the plane wave basis functions for the electric field and magnetic field of a te - polarized wave have respectively the form @xmath31 \\ , e^ { i \\ , n \\ , k_0 \\ , ( \\alpha \\ , x \\pm \\gamma \\ , z ) } , \\\\[6pt ] % \\label{te : pw : h : field } \\bm{h}^{\\rm te}(x , z ) & = & b \\ , \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\pm \\gamma \\\\ 0 \\\\ - \\alpha \\end{array } \\right ] \\ , e^ { i \\ , n \\ , k_0 \\ ,",
    "( \\alpha \\ , x \\pm \\gamma \\ , z ) } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for tm - polarized wave , the plane wave basis functions for the electric field and magnetic field have respectively the form eq .",
    "( [ te : pw : h : field ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ te : pw : e : field ] ) .    .",
    "the symbols @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent respectively the incident , reflected and transmitted fields .",
    "the field inside the slab is a superposition of two counter - propagating plane waves @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with a propagation constant @xmath25.,width=188 ]    now , let us assume that the semi - infinite medium ( 1 ) is replaced by a uniform dielectric slab of a finite thickness @xmath37 and refractive index @xmath17 , which is surrounded by the medium ( 0 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : slab : interfaces ] presents an illustration of this problem .",
    "the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 through the slab are  @xcite : @xmath38 the field inside the slab is a superposition of two counter - propagating plane waves .",
    "the interference between the counter - propagating waves can lead to some resonance effect .      with a propagating incident plane wave , we have @xmath39 .",
    "we can verify that the maximum value of @xmath40 is one and it is reached when @xmath41 ( fabry - perot resonance ) while the minimum value occurs when @xmath42 .",
    "so , at a fabry - perot resonance , we have a 100% transmission for a grazing incidence for both polarizations , despite the large mismatch between a tangential component of the plane wave basis function in the incident medium ( or the transmission medium ) and the plane wave basis function in the slab . by using the field continuity equations at the upper and lower interfaces",
    ", we can show that this high transmission is due to the fact a pair of counter - propagating plane waves of the homogeneous slab interact to cancel most of the problematic tangential component ( i.e. , the tangential component of the @xmath43-field and @xmath44-field for respectively the te and tm polarizations ) at the two interfaces of the slab , thus allowing a perfect field - matching with the small tangential components of the incident and transmitted fields .",
    "this perfect cancellation effect at a grazing incidence , of two relatively large field components inside the slab , can make the reflected and transmitted fields very sensitive to a perturbation of the field inside the slab .",
    "for an example , if the uniform dielectric slab is transformed into a photonic crystal slab ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pc : slab ] ) , a perfect cancellation ( at a fabry - perot resonance ) can not be expected as the modes in the slab are not plane waves . as a consequence , when the angle of incidence @xmath2 approaches @xmath45 , the perturbation to the slab field can dominate the small tangential component in the incident and transmission media . in such a situation , a strong contribution from many non - specular diffraction orders can be needed in order to match the tangential fields at either side of the slab interfaces , and it can be possible that some non - specular propagating orders get an exceptionally high diffraction efficiency for a grazing incidence . by reciprocity",
    "( see for instance  @xcite ) , i.e. , reversed incidence , the same photonic crystal slab can also efficiently couple light from an incident plane wave into a non - specular plane wave with a grazing angle of diffraction , and the intensity of the resulting diffracted field can be much higher than the intensity of the incident field ( due to a spatial compression of the incident plane wave ) .",
    "it follows that the properties , of the fabry - perot resonance at a grazing incidence , can be used to design photonic crystal slabs which can generate a diffracted wave with a strongly enhanced field .     and period @xmath46 .",
    "the photonic crystal consists of one - dimensional array of holes .",
    "the width of the holes is denoted @xmath47.,width=264 ]      with an incidence by an evanescent plane wave , the formulas eqs .",
    "( [ te : rho01:tau01])-([tm : rho01:tau01 ] ) for the reflection coefficient @xmath14 and transmission coefficient @xmath15 are still valid . but here the coefficient @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ gamma : zeta : fresnel ] ) is a purely imaginary complex number while @xmath25 remains a real number ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) .",
    "in particular we have @xmath49 .",
    "the formulas eq .",
    "( [ eq1:rt : uniform ] ) for the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 through a slab also remain valid , but here the denominator term becomes zero when we have the resonance condition @xmath50 , with @xmath51 .",
    "thus the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 tend to infinity as an incident wavelength approaches a resonance .",
    "we note that the resonance condition means that the phase shift suffered by a wave after a round trip ( consisting of downward and upward propagations , together with the reflection at the top and bottom interfaces ) inside the slab should be a multiple of @xmath52 and this resonance condition is often called guided - mode resonance because the guided modes of a planar waveguide also satisfy the same condition  @xcite .",
    "when the purely imaginary complex number @xmath24 approach zero , the interface transmission coefficient @xmath15 in eqs .",
    "( [ te : rho01:tau01])-([tm : rho01:tau01 ] ) tends to zero , however the transmission @xmath34 through a slab can still take large values near a guided - mode resonance .",
    "again , this is possible because a pair of counter - propagating plane waves in the slab interact to cancel a field component which was preventing the efficient transmission through a single interface . as a consequence of this cancellation , the solution of the scattering problem becomes very sensitive to a perturbation to the slab geometry .",
    "this effect can be used to design a photonic crystal slab which can enhance the magnitude of a diffracted evanescent field .",
    "we now give some details on the modeling of light transmission through a photonic crystal slab .",
    "we consider the one - dimensional photonic crystal slab shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc : slab ] .",
    "it has a period @xmath46 in the @xmath53-direction , is invariant with respect to @xmath54 and has a finite thickness @xmath37 in the @xmath55-direction .",
    "the photonic crystal slab consists of an array of holes ( of width @xmath47 and refractive index @xmath16 ) in a medium of refractive index @xmath17 and the refractive index of the upper and lower semi - infinite media are @xmath16 . when a plane wave , with a wavevector @xmath56 , is incident on a photonic crystal slab , the reflected and transmitted fields can be written as a superposition of plane waves with wavevector @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the diffraction order and the coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 are defined as @xmath61 by using the fact that the photonic crystal slab in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc : slab ] can be modeled as a periodic array of @xmath55-invariant waveguides , we can write the field inside the slab as a superposition of counter - propagating waveguide modes  @xcite .",
    "this modal expansion is a generalization of the treatment for a uniform dielectric film , but here the modal expansion involves a multitude of counter - propagating pairs of modes . a bloch mode @xmath62 of the array of cylinders is quasi - periodic with respect to the @xmath53 coordinate , i.e. , @xmath63 , and has an exponential dependence @xmath64 with respect to the @xmath55 coordinate . the modes @xmath62 of the array and their propagation constant @xmath65 can be computed using a one - dimensional version of the finite element method in  @xcite .",
    "the field continuity conditions at the upper and lower interface of the slab can be transformed into a system of linear equations  @xcite by projecting the modal expansion on either side of an interface onto a set of test functions ( adjoint modes ) .",
    "the coefficients of the modal expansions can be obtained by solving this linear system .",
    "the projection involves some overlap integrals between the modes of media ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) . for an example , let @xmath66 denotes the upper interface of a unit cell of the array . if @xmath66 is at the position @xmath67 , an overlap integral @xmath68 between a plane wave @xmath69 $ ] of the medium ( 0 ) and a mode @xmath70 $ ] of the medium ( 1 ) can be defined as ( see eq .",
    "( 64 ) of  @xcite ) : @xmath71 with @xmath72 for the examples considered in this work , the index contrast of the photonic crystal slab is relatively small and the wave propagation inside the slab is typically dominated by a single pair of counter - propagating modes .",
    "if @xmath73 is the propagation constant of the dominant mode , by analogy with a plane wave with a wavevector @xmath74 , we can define an average refractive index @xmath75 of the photonic crystal slab as @xmath76 the value of the average refractive index depends on the wavelength and on the polarization state .",
    "if for an incident wavelength @xmath19 , the phase @xmath77 is an integer multiple of @xmath78 , a fabry - perot resonance will occur for an incidence over a uniform dielectric slab of refractive index @xmath75 and the photonic crystal slab will typically display a resonant behavior at a wavelength near @xmath19 .",
    "thus the homogenized slab can be used to predict the approximate location of the resonant wavelengths of the photonic crystal slab .    for an incidence by a propagating plane wave , by using eq .",
    "( [ average : n ] ) , we can express the resonance condition @xmath79 , with @xmath51 , as : @xmath80 thus for given values of @xmath19 , @xmath81 and @xmath75 , we can easily find a thickness @xmath37 corresponding to a resonance .",

    "for the numerical calculations , we first consider the example of a one - dimensional photonic crystal slab which has same lattice constant and filling ratio as a two - dimensional square array of holes described in  @xcite , where the photonic crystal structures found in the cell wall ( frustule ) of the marine diatom _ coscinodiscus granii _ have been analyzed",

    "the scattering problems are solved with the modal method  @xcite , which uses a finite element method  @xcite to compute the bloch modes . for an illustration of the derivations presented in section  [ section : r : t : pcs ] , we want to find a thickness @xmath37 of the photonic crystal slab such that a fabry - perot resonance occurs at a grazing angle of incidence ( e.g. , @xmath94 ) near the wavelength @xmath95 ( blue color spectrum ) .",
    "this value of the wavelength is chosen because diatoms can display high photosynthetic activity in the blue and red regions of the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "it is also said in  @xcite that the diatom frustule slab , with a square lattice array , has a thickness between 200 and 600  nm , and , as we shall see , this range includes the slab thickness where a fabry - perot resonance occurs at the wavelength @xmath95 .",

    "this deviation from the operating wavelength @xmath95 can be explained by the fact the slab thickness @xmath141 is not close enough to the calculated resonance thickness @xmath140 for the tm - polarization .",

    "the results in section  [ section : simulations ] show that , when a non - specular order is resonantly coupled to a photonic crystal slab mode near a rayleigh anomaly , the corresponding diffraction coefficient can take very large values as the incident wavelength @xmath19 approaches the rayleigh anomaly wavelength .",
    "this property can be applied to design photonic crystal slabs which can increase the intensity of an incident plane wave by a large factor .",

    ", the diffraction coefficient of a non - specular order @xmath58 typically takes very small values as its angle of diffraction approaches @xmath45 . when little energy is available , it is not possible to fully take advantage of the fact that diffraction gratings can exhibit an arbitrarily large angular dispersion near a rayleigh anomaly .",
    "but , with the resonant cases illustrated in figs .  [ fig4:fabry - perot : l450 ] and [ fig3:fabry - perot : l450:2d ] , it can make sense to consider the proprieties of a diffracted wave in the limit where an incident wavelength is arbitrarily close to the rayleigh anomaly wavelength .    as an example , for a given incident ray and when a grating is rotating , the angle of incidence @xmath81 of the ray at a time @xmath151 will change with an angular velocity denoted @xmath152 . for a propagating diffraction order @xmath58",
    ", the diffracted wave will rotate at an angular speed @xmath153 .",
    "the frequency shift can be analyzed by using a doppler shift formula since the diffracted light behaves like ( or simulates ) the light emitted from a surface which is rotating at the angular velocity @xmath154  @xcite . by taking the time - derivative of the grating equation @xmath155 , at a fixed wavelength",
    ", the angular velocity @xmath154 can be expressed in term of @xmath152 as @xmath156 .",
    "this shows that the angular velocity of a non - specular diffracted ray increases toward infinity as the angle of diffraction @xmath157 approaches @xmath45 . such a fast moving ray can potentially shift the frequency of the incident light substantially .",
    "interestingly , diatoms can exhibit some oscillatory ( or rotational ) motion when subjected to water flows  @xcite , which has some similarity with the tendency of plant leaves to oscillate under the wind .",
    "such an oscillation has the potential to strongly shift an incident frequency near a rayleigh anomaly ( when it is coupled with a fabry - perot resonance ) .",
    "however , at this time , it is not possible to know if such a frequency shift is relevant to the photosynthetic processes in diatoms .",
    "photonic crystal slabs can be designed to enhance the intensity of an incident plane wave by an extremely large factor . although we have only studied the case of a light transmission ,",
    "the generalization of the main results to a light reflection is straightforward .",
    "we have given a clear physical explanation , based on the properties of the fabry - perot resonance and the rayleigh anomaly , for the origin of this enhancement effect . by applying the physical interpretations ,",
    "we have developed an effective medium technique which can be used to efficiently design a photonic crystal slab , with a resonance wavelength near a given value .",
    "for the case of a scattering into propagating diffracted order , the field magnification is due to a spatial compression of the incident wave and so the diffracted field propagates at a grazing angle of diffraction .",
    "the numerical results also suggest that the photonic crystal slabs found in diatom frustules can produce a substantially enhanced field and it will be interesting to investigate the significance of this enhancement to the photosynthetic processes in diatoms .",
    "the combination of the fabry - perot resonance with the rayleigh anomaly implies that a non - specular diffraction order can still transmit or reflect an intense light , for incident wavelengths which are extremely close to the rayleigh anomaly wavelength .",
    "this opens up the possibility of an efficient operation of a diffraction grating in the limit where an incident wavelength is arbitrarily close to a rayleigh anomaly wavelength , a regime where diffraction gratings have an extremely large angular dispersion , e.g. , with respect to the incident wavelength or the incidence angle .",
    "for an example , a rotation of the grating at a moderate angular speed can induce a diffracted field which rotates with an extremely large angular velocity , and this in turn can produce a relatively large frequency shift .",
