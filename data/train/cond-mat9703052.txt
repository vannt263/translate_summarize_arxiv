    "one of the unusual ground states encountered in quasi - one - dimensional spin - systems is the spin - peierls ( sp ) groundstate , where a magneto - elastic coupling leads below the transition temperature @xmath1 to a dimerisation of the spin - chain and thus to the formation of a non- magnetic singlet @xcite . up to 1993 , this transition has only been observed in a few organic compounds @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a sp - state in the inorganic compound @xmath2 @xcite has renewed strong interest in this phenomenon : for the first time , detailed studies of a sp - system on large single crystals @xcite as well as investigations of the effect of impurities @xcite on a sp - groundstate are possible . yet , despite intensive research for other compounds , @xmath2 has remained the only known inorganic sp - system . in 1996 , isobe et al .",
    "@xcite found a pronounced decrease of the susceptibility @xmath3 ( t ) in @xmath0 below t @xmath4 34 k and concluded the opening of a spin - gap .",
    "the remaining susceptibility below the transition temperature was attributed to van - vleck contributions as observed in @xmath5 , where a singulett is formed already above room temperature @xcite .",
    "the orthorombic crystal structure @xcite of @xmath0 contains @xmath6 ( s = 1/2)-chains along the b - axis , in which the spins are antiferromagnetically coupled with an exchange coupling j = 560 k @xcite .",
    "these chains are separated from each other by nonmagnetic @xmath7-chains , which results in a quasi - one- dimensional behaviour of the magnetic properties @xcite . since isobe et al . only performed measurements on polycrystalline samples , they were not able to study the orientation dependence of the magnetic transition itself and of the susceptiblity above the transition to proof a negligible influence of spin anisotropy and a primary isotropic heisenberg - character of the spin - chains . additionally , they were not able to confirm the existence of any crystallographic distortions at the transition temperature , a feature which is , however , essential for a sp - transition . also , an analysis of the susceptibility on polycrystalline samples by mila et al .",
    "@xcite revealed no transition at all despite a similar exchange coupling of j = 529 k.",
    "the single crystals used for the investigations were grown by a self - flux method .",
    "details of the preparation procedure will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we observe a strong dependence of the transition on the na - content : both excess and defficiency decrease the transition temperature .",
    "susceptibility measurements were performed with a commercial squid- magnetometer ( mpms , quantum design ) .",
    "raman - measurements were performed with an ar - laser ( @xmath8= 514.5 nm ) and a dilor xy - spectrometer including a nitrogen - cooled ccd - detector .",
    "the results of the measurements of the susceptibility @xmath3 ( t ) with magnetic field parallel to the three crystallographic axes are shown in fig .",
    "as the crystals are thin platelets , several crystals were oriented parallel and fixed using a small amount of wax . this wax lead to a temperature - independent diamagnetic background , which size could not be determined precisely . owing to the fact that at low temperatures @xmath3 ( t ) corresponds to a temperature - independent van - vleck - contribution , we shifted the experimental values to fit the value at t = 2 k obtained in a measurement without any wax .",
    "these shifts correspond to the addition of a temperature - independent value and will therefore neither affect the absolute size of the anomaly in @xmath3 ( t ) nor the temperature dependence .",
    "in contrast to the results of isobe et al . , our measurements show no curie - contribution at low temperatures , indicating the high quality of the single crystals .",
    "the decrease of @xmath3 ( t ) below the transition temperature presents the same shape and nearly the same magnitude along the three axes .",
    "such an isotropic behaviour is the characteristic sign of the opening of a spin gap and can not be due to another magnetic instability , e.g. a n el - transition .",
    "the slight differences in the magnitude of @xmath3 ( t ) above the transition temperature can be accounted for by an anisotropy in the g - factor .",
    "assuming g = 2 for b @xmath9 c , this would lead to g = 2.06 for b @xmath9 b and g = 2.14 for b @xmath9 a. apart for this difference , the temperature dependence of @xmath3 ( t ) is the same along the three axes indicating the isotropic heisenberg - character of the spin - chains . below the transition temperature , the temperature dependence of the susceptibility was fitted using the theory of bulaevskii @xcite , where @xmath3 ( t ) of a dimerized chain is calculated using two parameters j and @xmath10 , j being the mean coupling constant , @xmath10 describing the dimerization . the gap energy @xmath11 can be deduced from j and @xmath10 using the theories of pytte @xcite and bray et al . @xcite .",
    "the result of the fit is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "1 . we obtain @xmath12 85 1 15 k , j = 441 k ; the values differ only slightly between the different directions and for similar analyses on polycrystals .",
    "j is in good agreement with j = 560 k @xcite or j = 529 k @xcite obtained from the high temperature susceptibility .",
    "investigations of the field dependence of the transition temperature of a polycrystalline sample revealed a small shift to lower temperatures @xmath13 0.15 k at b = 5.5 t. the observed field dependence can be well described using the theory of bulaevskii @xciteand cross @xcite for the field dependence of a sp - system : @xmath14 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "we found @xmath15 0.118 , in good agreement with theoretical predictions of @xmath16 = 0.091 - 0.11 for a sp - system @xcite .",
    "this field dependence clearly indicates that the transition is not a simple structural one .",
    "raman scattering experiments were performed in quasi - backscattering geometry .",
    "the polarization was parallel to the @xmath6-chains ( bb ) , perpendicular ( aa ) or crossed polarized ( ab ) .",
    "several phonons could be detected for temperatures above the transition temperature .",
    "six modes were observed both in ( aa ) as well as in ( bb ) geometry : at 88 , 178 , 304 , 420 , 530 and 971 @xmath17 .",
    "additionaly there is one mode at 230 @xmath17 only observable in ( aa ) and one mode at 449 @xmath17 only observable in ( bb)-polarization . in ( ab ) geometry , four modes were identified at 173 , 262 , 292 and 685 @xmath17 . besides , small residual contributions could be observed at 449 and 530 @xmath17 . along the chains ( b - axis ) , the modes at 449 and 530 @xmath17 are strongly asymmetric and show a tail towards the high energy side . taking into account that the energy of these modes are very close to the energy scale of spin excitations along the heisenberg chains , we would suggest that these tails form due to magnetic raman scattering .",
    "further experiments are required to clarify the nature of this effect . below the transition temperature",
    "several new modes could be detected . in fig .",
    "2 , spectra at t = 100 k and at t = 5 k in ( bb ) geometry are compared .",
    "strong additional peaks are seen at 65 , 104 , 130 , 650 and 945 @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , smaller contributions appear at 230 , 246 and 296 @xmath17 .",
    "also , a formerly symmetry forbidden mode from ( ab)-polarization at 685 @xmath17 is now observable .",
    "as e.g. the mode at 945 @xmath17 can be asssigned to a phonon mode due to its lineshape , clear evidence is given that the transition leads to a symmetry breaking of the lattice .",
    "we have grown for the first time single crystals of @xmath0 and present the first investigations of the orientation - dependence of the susceptibility and the first raman - results .",
    "we found at the transition temperature an isotropic decrease of the susceptibility pointing to the opening of a spin - gap and the formation of a spin - singlet .",
    "also , the isotropy of the susceptibility proves the chains to be of isotropic heisenberg - type .",
    "the raman experiments indicate that this magnetic transition is accompanied by a crystallographic distortion .",
    "the field dependence of the transition temperature rules out a simple structural transition .",
    "the isotropic exponential disappearance of the spin - susceptibility , a simultaneous crystallographic distortion and the field dependence of the transition temperature are the hallmarks of a spin - peierls transition .",
    "therefore , our results clearly prove @xmath0 to be the second inorganic sp - system , having the highest transition temperature t@xmath18 = 34 k of all known sp - systems .",
