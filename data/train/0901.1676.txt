    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been extremely successful at explaining experimental data to date .",
    "it has , however , failed to provide answers to fundamental problems , such as the unification of the gauge couplings at high energies , as well as the difference between such a unification scale and that of electro - weak ( ew ) interactions ( known as the hierarchy problem ) .",
    "introducing a new fundamental symmetry of nature between bosons and fermions , known as supersymmetry ( susy ) , solves both these problems .",
    "if susy exists at the ew scale , it should be discovered at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , all known particles will have supersymmetric partners , known as sparticles .",
    "additionally , in the mssm , two complex higgs doublets are required to avoid anomalies , which in turn have supersymmetric partner states .",
    "ew symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) results in five higgs bosons in the mssm .",
    "the lightest neutral higgs state of the mssm , @xmath10 , is likely to have a mass of less than 135 gev , so it is well within the kinematic reach of the lhc .",
    "current experimental limits on the mass of the sparticles that could enter @xmath0 decay channels are such that ( with the possible exception of invisible @xmath0 decays , e.g. , into two neutralinos , the susy partners of the sm neutral gauge / higgs bosons , which are however small @xcite ) the @xmath0 decay modes that are interesting phenomenologically are those involving sm particles ( henceforth we will refer to these as sm - like channels , likewise for the production modes involving couplings to sm particles only ) .",
    "however , it does not follow that @xmath0 decay modes and possible discovery channels should be the same as for a low mass sm higgs state ( hereafter denoted by @xmath11 ) .",
    "in fact , supersymmetric effects can affect both the higgs production and decay rates .",
    "the @xmath2 production channel is interesting for two main reasons : 1 .",
    "it provides a production mechanism for the lightest supersymmetric higgs boson , in addition or as an alternative to the sm - like channels ; 2 .",
    "its production rates are strongly dependent on the mssm parameters . for @xmath12 135",
    "gev , the dominant decay mode is @xmath13 , however , at the lhc the inclusive @xmath13 decay is not visible due to the large qcd background .",
    "the @xmath14 decay mode is the most probable lhc discovery channel for a higgs boson at these masses @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 decay , however , can be affected by supersymmetric effects @xcite , in such a way that cancellations between the sm particle loops and those involving their susy partners can occur over large regions of the mssm parameter space .",
    "this may deplete the @xmath15 decay rates below experimental observability channel but even more so to the inclusive mode , as a similar mechanism onsets in the suppression of the @xmath16 production channel . ] .",
    "this typically occurs for light stop quarks , with a mass of order of that of the top quark or below . in turn",
    ", this means that one could re - establish the lost sm - like di - photon signal by exploiting higgs production in association with ( light ) stop quarks .",
    "even when associated higgs production and decay has a lower cross section than the inclusive di - photon channel , the extra final state particles can render this susy channel visible over the background by providing useful triggers , thereby possibly also enabling @xmath17 detection .    under the above circumstances",
    ", one can elaborate on point 1 as follows .",
    "take for example the sm counterpart of @xmath2 , i.e. , higgs boson production in association with top quarks , @xmath18 .",
    "this channel has been studied by both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite . here , the associated top quarks decay to @xmath19-quarks and one of the @xmath20-quarks decays leptonically and the other hadronically .",
    "since the dominant decay of the @xmath11 state is @xmath21 , a four @xmath19-quark final state is produced .",
    "this is much more visible over the qcd background than the inclusive two @xmath19-quark final state .",
    "the scope of this channel in the sm is now questionable though , as its feasibility is not certain @xcite .",
    "however , in the mssm , when there is a large stop mixing , the coupling of the lightest stop to the lightest higgs boson can be larger than the top yukawa coupling .",
    "this means that in the mssm the @xmath2 cross section can be larger than the @xmath22 one .",
    "in addition , for stop masses suitably larger than @xmath23 , the @xmath24 decay could occur with a branching ratio ( br ) nearing one .",
    "the final outcome would then be a signature similar to that emerging in the sm from @xmath25 , possibly with larger rates and an additional handle for background rejection , the larger missing transverse energy ( due to the two neutralinos escaping detection ) with respect to the sm case ( when it is only due to one neutrino produced in the leptonic top decay ) .",
    "the @xmath2 channel therefore has the potential to be an interesting channel for higgs discovery in the mssm and this is the reason why it has received considerable attention in the literature @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 channel can also provide information on the underlying supersymmetric scenario , point 2 above .",
    "if susy exists at the ew scale , particularly in the form of light squarks , it should be discovered at the lhc in direct @xmath26 production ( i.e. , without subsequent @xmath0 emission ) .",
    "however , information on the particular supersymmetric model and its parameters will be hard to determine from this process ( primarily because it proceeds via qcd interactions , which are not modified with respect to the sm by susy , so that the only susy parameter measurable is here @xmath27 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 cross section , however , is dependent on several low energy mssm parameters .",
    "these enter the @xmath2 cross section through both the lightest stop mass and its couplings to the lightest higgs boson . measuring the @xmath2 cross section",
    "could therefore provide us with decisive information on the susy - breaking scenario and its parameters .",
    "importantly , such low energy susy parameters can directly be related to those defining the supergravity inspired mssm ( msugra ) , which is one of the simplest possible scenarios in the choice of the soft susy - breaking parameters at the grand unification ( gut ) scale . in msugra ,",
    "the scalar masses , scalar couplings and gaugino masses are all equal ( separately ) at the gut scale .",
    "the remaining two parameters needed to describe soft susy breaking in msugra are the soft higgs mixing parameter , @xmath19 , and the higgs mixing parameter of the two doublets , @xmath28 .",
    "however , using constraints from the known value of the @xmath29 mass , these two parameters can be calculated from two ew scale parameters : @xmath30 ( the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two higgs doublet fields ) and the sign of @xmath28 .",
    "this means that the over one hundred mssm parameters can be reduced to the following five msugra ones .",
    "@xmath31 , the universal scalar mass , defined at the gut scale .",
    "@xmath32 , the universal gaugino mass , defined at the gut scale .",
    "@xmath33 , the universal trilinear coupling , defined at the gut scale .",
    "@xmath30 , defined at the ew scale .    \\5 .",
    "@xmath34 , the sign of the higgs mass parameter , defined at the ew scale .",
    "the @xmath2 cross section depends at lowest order on @xmath30 and @xmath34 defined at the ew scale and  through the renormalisation group evolution ( rge ) equations of the model  also on the @xmath35 , @xmath32 and @xmath36 gut parameters .    in this paper",
    "we examine possible decay channels and test their suitability for detection at the lhc . in the next section , we review existing literature and update old results by using more recent simulation software .",
    "we also perform new scans over the mssm and msugra parameter spaces , where both production and decay rates are determined .",
    "finally , we conclude in the last section .",
    "since the publication of @xcite , the experimental constraints have been revised , and the theoretical models have been improved . in this , and the following , section we describe the updates to these results , using the latest simulation packages , primarily those that determine the mssm and msugra spectra of masses , couplings and brs . here",
    "we use isasusy and isasugra @xcite and both were interfaced to the supersymmetric version @xcite of the herwig monte carlo ( mc ) program @xcite , where the production process ( tested against feynhiggs @xcite ) is implemented alongside the ( matrix element modelled ) decays of the final state objects .",
    "there are previous papers that describe studies of higgs production in association with light squark pairs .",
    "the first is ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", scans over the five msugra parameters were carried out ( for all processes of the type squark - squark - higgs , though in this paper we only concentrate on the @xmath2 case ) .",
    "the parameter space explored was defined as follows :    @xmath37 @xmath38 gev .",
    "( these low stop and gaugino masses were chosen to give low stop and higgs masses in order to enhance the cross section . )",
    "@xmath37 @xmath33 was set to @xmath39 gev , in order to investigate its behaviour as it changes sign .",
    "@xmath37 both values of @xmath40 were investigated .",
    "@xmath37 @xmath30 was scanned over values between @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "cross section values resulting from the variation of msugra parameters.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    figure [ figure : crosssectionmor ] shows the @xmath2 cross section results from the scans over this msugra space .",
    "these cross sections are sizably different from those presented in the original paper .",
    "different codes were used , however , we have traced back this difference to an error in the convention used by @xcite in the definition of the stop mixing angle , @xmath43 .",
    "while this error is of no consequence for the calculation of the higgs ( the angle enters here through the _ square _ of its @xmath44 function ) and stop ( which is independent by definition ) masses , it can have a sizable impact in the @xmath2 coupling , as the latter can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the mass of the @xmath47 gauge boson and @xmath48 is the weak mixing angle .",
    "the cross sections given in figure [ figure : crosssectionmor ] are generally lower than those presented in ref .",
    "figure [ figure : crosssectionmor ] shows that , in general , the cross section decreases with increasing @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , it is highest for @xmath49 gev and @xmath50 .",
    "this is to be expected , as it will give the highest value for @xmath51 , as the negative gauge corrections increase the magnitude of a negative @xmath33 .",
    "there are also minima in the cross section for two of the scans , which were not seen in the scans presented in @xcite , and are a result of the new calculation of the stop mixing angle .    in @xcite ,",
    "two scans over @xmath32 were also investigated .",
    "the two scans are defined in table [ table : spectrums ] , as the `` general low mass spectrum '' and the `` general high mass spectrum '' .",
    ".the msugra parameters corresponding to the high mass and low mass spectra . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     all these limits are taken from lep2 and tevatron searches .",
    "a summary of the experimental limits on ( s)particle masses can be found in @xcite .    in order for the experimental limits to be imposed in a comprehensive way ,",
    "all sparticle mass limits should be considered , as each parameter point in the mssm or msugra space can yield susy states not relevant to the @xmath2 cross section yet being inconsistent with experiment . clearly , it is possible to alter the masses of ( most ) other particles without changing the @xmath2 cross section .",
    "this can be done by altering the values of any of the mssm parameters , bar the six that affect the @xmath2 channel .    performing a scan respecting the experimental limits given in table [ table : exlimits ] results in the @xmath2 cross sections shown in figure [ figure : susyexcrosssection ] .",
    "cross section values resulting from the variation of mssm parameters after the experimental constraints in table [ table : exlimits ] have been taken into account.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    this shows that the cross sections for @xmath2 with @xmath52 or @xmath53 can reach a few pb . for the @xmath54 decay channel",
    "the cross sections reach a maximum of around 50 fb .",
    "in summary , multi - dimensional scans were carried out over the msugra and mssm parameter spaces .",
    "it was found that the highest @xmath2 cross sections correspond to low stop masses . in these areas",
    "the stop is most likely to decay to a charm quark and the lightest neutralino .",
    "considering that the @xmath0 almost always yields @xmath55 pairs , the complete final state in presence of these decays will be two charm quarks , two bottom quarks and missing energy .",
    "the final state for the areas where the stop decays to a bottom quark will be four bottom quarks , missing energy , plus two pairs of jets and/or leptons from the chargino decays .",
    "the same final state will occur for the stop to top quark decay , with the additional jets or leptons originating from the @xmath56 boson produced in the top decay .",
    "there is also the possibility of mixed stop decays , leading to even more variation in the final states .",
    "the diversity in the final states means that different triggers , backgrounds and selection algorithms will need to be considered for each decay channel .",
    "further detailed studies will therefore be required in order to ascertain the visibility of the @xmath2 channel at the lhc .",
