    "we study the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) multiway relay channel ( mwrc ) , in which @xmath0 users exchange full information at the same / equal rate via a relay .",
    "this channel models centralized networks where users communicate among themselves via a base station , e.g. , multiuser mobile video conference calls .",
    "we consider the awgn mwrc with @xmath0 users and one relay where is no direct link between any pair of users , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mwrc ] .",
    "each user has a transmitted power constraint @xmath1 , the relay has a transmitted power constraint @xmath2 , and the receiver noise at all users and the relay is normalized to one . each user is to transmit its data to all other users at the same rate . we obtain the capacity when @xmath3 more specifically , we have    1 .   the capacity if @xmath4 and @xmath5 , i.e. , when there are three or more users , and when all users and the relay transmit at the same power ; 2 .   achievable rates within a constant @xmath6 bits of the capacity for all @xmath1 if @xmath7 , i.e. , when relay power scales with the number of users .      the mwrc is an extension of the two - way relay channel ( twrc ) , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "since there is an embedded relay channel from user 1 to user 2 via the relay , and vice versa , coding strategies proposed for relay networks  @xcite , i.e. , complete - decode - forward , compress - forward , and amplify - forward , have been modified for the twrc  @xcite . besides the aforementioned classical relaying strategies for relay networks , yu et al .",
    "@xcite and larsson et al .",
    "@xcite used the idea of network coding  @xcite for the twrc and proposed that the relay performs a modulo - two summation of the users messages , and broadcasts the summation . after getting the sum of the messages , each user",
    "can then obtain the other user s message by subtracting its own message from the sum .",
    "the network - coding - like operation can also be achieved at the modulation level , if amplify - forward is carried out using binary phase - shift keying ( bpsk )  @xcite or minimum - shift keying ( msk ) modulation  @xcite .",
    "since the relay needs to broadcast only the modulo - sum of the messages ( or in general a function defined such that , having the function and its message , each user is able to decode the message of the other user ) , the relay may directly decode the function that it will broadcast without needing to decode the individual messages .",
    "this strategy is known as functional - decode - forward and also compute - and - forward .",
    "this strategy was studied on the binary twrc using binary linear codes  @xcite , and on the awgn twrc using lattice codes  @xcite .",
    "the scenario of having a relay decoding a linear function of messages from multiple senders was studied by nazer and gastpar  @xcite .",
    "complete - decode - forward , compress - forward , and amplify - forward for the twrc were subsequently extended to the mwrc by gndz et al .",
    "we extended functional - decode - forward to the binary mwrc  @xcite .",
    "the idea was to split the uplink into @xmath9 blocks , and when the user pairs @xmath10 transmit in the blocks respectively . in each block , the relay decodes a function ( in this case , the modulo - two sum ) of the two corresponding messages , and broadcasts the function back to the users .",
    "if each user can decode the @xmath9 functions from the relay , it can then decode the messages of all the other users . in this paper",

    "we propose a _ rotated _ scheme such that for each message to be sent , the uplink is again split into @xmath9 blocks , but different pairs of users are chosen from @xmath11 for each message in a round - robin fashion .",
    "this modification enables each user to transmit at a higher power when active while keeping the average transmitted power to @xmath1 . for each block ,",
    "the two active users transmit using lattice codes as they do in the awgn twrc  @xcite .    while the aforementioned functional - decode - forward for the binary mwrc  @xcite and for the awgn mwrc ( this paper ) deals with users transmitting at the same rate , we have recently extended this coding strategy to the finite field mwrc where the users transmit at possibly different rates@xcite .",

    "@xcite that for the restricted awgn mwrc , complete - decode - forward performs poorly at high snr , compress - forward achieves rates within a constant fraction of a bit of the capacity at all snrs , and amplify - forward is always worse than compress - forward at all snrs . for the case where all nodes transmit at the same power",
    ", the same authors noted that complete - decode - forward achieves the capacity with `` a smaller number of users '' .",

    "when all nodes transmit at the same power , we obtain the capacity by showing that complete - decode - forward achieves the capacity for snr @xmath12 db , and functional - decode - forward achieves the capacity for snr @xmath13 db .",
    "as we shall see , neither coding strategy utilizes feedback at the users , and hence we incidentally obtain the capacity for the corresponding restricted awgn mwrc ( for three or more users and equal transmitted power ) .    for the case where the relay s transmitted power scales with the number of users ,",

    "theorem : scaling ] consider the awgn mwrc with @xmath225 .",

    ", we further show that this coding strategy can also achieve within a constant fraction of a bit of the equal - rate capacity of the unrestricted awgn mwrc when @xmath7 .",

    "theorem : ifdf - grater - than - cf ] , functional - decode - forward achieves higher rates than compress - forward at high snr .",
    "hence , in the high snr regime , functional - decode - forward outperforms the other two schemes .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ fig : pfdf-3 ] compares the maximum achievable rates of different coding strategies and the capacity upper bound .",
    "we fix the number of users at @xmath243 , and vary the snr ( defined as the snr at the relay ) . at low snr , complete - decode - forward achieves rates higher than the other two coding strategies . as snr increases , the performance of complete - decode - forward degrades , as predicted in theorem  [ theorem : scaling ] .",
    "as expected , functional - decode - forward and compress - forward achieve rates within constant gaps from the capacity upper bound , and the former achieves a higher rate at high snr . in this example , we see that at any snr , either complete - decode - forward or functional - decode - forward outperforms compress - forward .",
    "this phenomenon is also observed for different @xmath0 , and leads to the following conjecture :    consider the awgn mwrc with @xmath225 . for any @xmath0 and any @xmath1 , @xmath244 .",
    "we extended functional - decode - forward to the awgn multiway relay channel ( mwrc ) , and derived a new achievable equal - rate region for the channel . combining this strategy with an existing strategy , complete - decode - forward",
    ", we obtained the capacity for the awgn mwrc with three or more users when all nodes transmit at the same power .",
    "thus the awgn mwrc is one that , at the time of writing , requires more than one coding strategy to achieve the capacity .",
    "the capacity - achieving strategies do not utilize feedback from the channel to the users , which implies that feedback does not increase the equal - rate capacity of the awgn mwrc when all nodes transmit at the same power .    for the case when the relay power scales with the number of users , the bottleneck of the network is no longer on the downlink , and we demonstrated that none of functional - decode - forward , complete - decode - forward , or compress - forward is able to achieve the capacity upper bound . however , functional - decode - forward and compress - forward achieve rates within a fixed number of bits of the capacity .",
    "numerical results suggest that for any @xmath0 and at any snr , either complete - decode - forward or functional - decode - forward is able to outperform compress - forward .",
    "so , for awgn mwrcs with equal transmitted power and where the relay s transmitted power scales with the number of users , among the four coding strategies , namely , functional - decode - forward , complete - decode - forward , compress - forward , and amplify - forward , as far as the transmission rate is concerned , complete - decode - forward and functional - decode - forward will suffice .",
    "the transmission scheme for @xmath103 for the first five message tuples is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme ] .",
    "the symbol @xmath245 means that the node ( say node @xmath18 ) transmits using lattice codes @xmath246 with power @xmath247/n = \\frac{5}{2}p$ ] ; while @xmath248 means that it does not transmit , i.e. , @xmath249 .",
    "since , each node only transmits in a fraction of @xmath250 of the time , the average transmitted power is @xmath1 .",
