    "duality relations @xcite are symmetries which relate partition functions of classical spin models .",
    "the prototype for these symmetries , and its most famous example , is the well - known kramers and wannier duality in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model @xcite .",
    "this symmetry relates the partition function of a 2d ising model at temperature @xmath1 to the partition function of another 2d ising model at temperature @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is a decreasing function of @xmath1 , and allowed for the first exact determination of the critical point of the model , before its exact solution by onsager @xcite .",
    "if it is known that the critical point is unique , then it must be at @xmath3 , and can be determined by the duality relation . besides its interest in the determination of critical points @xcite , dualities are also used to map properties of well - studied models to less developed ones @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is known that in three dimensions z(2 ) lattice gauge theory is dual to the ising model .",
    "thus all work developed in understanding the latter can be translated via duality relations to bring information about the former @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore duality relations in z(2 ) lattice gauge theories and ising models in two and three dimensions making use of an algebraic reformulation of spin models we developed for the case of the z(2 ) pure gauge theory in an earlier paper @xcite .",
    "the kramers - wannier dualities can be briefly stated as follows @xcite . for each dimension @xmath4 and integer @xmath5 , @xmath6 , there is one @xmath4-dimensional generalised ising model denoted @xmath7 , whose local variables are ising spins @xmath8 .",
    "the index @xmath5 indicates where the spins are situated . for spins lying on vertices ,",
    "links and faces we have @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the terms in the hamiltonian are products of spins lying on the boundary of links for @xmath9 , of faces for @xmath12 , etc .",
    "therefore , @xmath13 describes the usual @xmath4-dimensional ising model , with two - spin interactions and ising spins at vertices .",
    "@xmath14 is the z(2 ) pure gauge theory in @xmath4 dimensions , with spins lying on links and plaquette terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "an external magnetic field @xmath15 can be added to any @xmath7 .",
    "if that is the case , then @xmath13 becomes the ising model with an external magnetic field , and @xmath14 describes the z(2 ) gauge theory coupled to a higgs matter field .",
    "there are two kinds of duality relations . in the absence of magnetic field , the models @xmath7 and @xmath16 are dual . in the presence of a magnetic field , the models @xmath7 and @xmath17 are dual . for the simplest cases ,",
    "one finds the following . in two dimensions ,",
    "the ising model is self - dual in the absence of magnetic field , and dual to the z(2 ) higgs - gauge theory in the presence of magnetic field . in three dimensions ,",
    "the ising model is dual to z(2 ) pure gauge theory , and the z(2 ) higgs - gauge theory is self - dual .",
    "we extend these dualities in two directions .",
    "first , we consider more general lattices than the square and cubic lattices traditionally used .",
    "second , we describe them as special cases of a larger class of gl(2,@xmath18 ) symmetries acting on generalised z(2 ) lattice gauge theories herein defined . a mathematical formalism borrowed from topological field theories",
    "is used to develop an algebraic description of z(2 ) gauge - ising models , following the procedure introduced in @xcite for the case of the z(2 ) pure gauge theory on three - dimensional triangulations .",
    "this leads us to associate a bidimensional vector space @xmath0 with algebra and coalgebra structures to each model under study .",
    "if the vector basis of @xmath0 is changed , a lattice model equivalent to the original one is obtained .",
    "we study two specific changes of basis of @xmath0 .",
    "one transformation leads to explicit expressions for the kramers - wannier dualities on arbitrary lattices .",
    "the cases of triangulations and regular lattices in two and three dimensions are worked out in detail .",
    "usually , one needs to study these dualities case - by - case , applying sequences of combinatorial moves as the decoration transformation or the star square transformation @xcite in a manner suited for each lattice under consideration . in the algebraic formalism",
    ", all these operations are shown to be contained in a single change of basis of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we study an one - parameter class of symmetry transformations for which the gauge coupling constant changes continuously in the two - dimensional generalised z(2 ) gauge theories as another application of the general formalism .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief description of z(2 ) gauge theories and ising models in @xmath4-dimensions , mainly to fix notation . in section 3",
    "we introduce our algebraic reformulation of the z(2 ) lattice gauge theory .",
    "the cases of the pure and higgs - gauge theories are considered , for triangulations and hypercubic lattices . in section 4",
    "we define the generalised gauge theories studied in this paper and prove that for any change of basis in @xmath0 there is a related duality transformation between these models .",
    "we work out many examples in two and three dimensions . in particular , we describe the classical kramers - wannier dualities as special instances of our formalism . in section 5",
    "we study in two dimensions the one - parameter class of symmetry transformations for which the gauge coupling changes continuously .",

    "the partition function is the product of all local weights in the lattice , summed over all spin configurations .",
    "we denote it by @xmath305 .",
    "as it is obtained with the application of a change of basis in the 2d higgs - gauge theory , it follows that @xmath306 where the parameters @xmath307 must satisfy the relations of eq . [ eq : cont - duality ] , and @xmath308 , @xmath309 .",
    "the expression in eq .",
    "[ eq : mod - mag ] gives a family of continuous symmetries among the spin - gauge models @xmath305 . in these symmetries",
    ", there is no need to invoke the dual lattice .",
    "instead , we work with a less rigid discrete space , in which the combinatorial structures of both @xmath19 and @xmath161 show up naturally . for such discretisation , the models related by the symmetry transformations live on the same lattice .",
    "a doubling of variables occurs , as we do not assign a single spin to each link , but one for each face meeting at the link .",
    "the models obtained are equivalent to the z(2 ) higgs - gauge theory , which in turn is dual to the bidimensional ising model in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "whether these modified theories may help in understanding the unsolved 2d transverse ising model , we leave here as an open question .",
    "in this paper we studied a general class of symmetries relating partition functions of a family of classical spin models which generalises the ising model and z(2 ) lattice gauge theory .",
    "we interpreted these theories algebraically in terms of the structure constants of a vector space @xmath0 equipped with algebra and coalgebra structures , using a formalism reminiscent from topological quantum field theories , and proved that to any change of basis of @xmath0 there is an associated symmetry between these models .",
    "the well known kramers and wannier dualities of @xcite were shown to be special cases of this formalism .",
    "we studied these dualities on two- and three - dimensional triangulations , extending results known for the case of square and cubic lattices .",
    "in addition , a new class of continuous symmetry transformations involving generalised z(2 ) gauge theories in two dimensions was developed .    in two dimensions",
    ", we found the following results .",
    "it is well known that pure gauge theories in two dimensions are exactly soluble . as a simple application of our formalism ,",
    "we have described a change of basis of @xmath0 which trivialises the theory and yields a solution for the partition function which is valid for any triangulation .",
    "the duality of the 2d higgs - gauge to the ising model coupled to a magnetic field was studied on general triangulations .",
    "explicit expressions for the relation between the partition functions on general lattices were given , in terms of simple combinatorial factors such as the number of links and faces in the lattice .",
    "we also proved the existence of new symmetries relating the z(2 ) higgs - gauge theory to a generalised model described by three coupling constants , which describe a plaquette interaction , a magnetic field term , and an additional ising interaction .",
    "the new symmetry transformations describe continuous transformations of these coupling constants .    in three dimensions",
    ", we studied the duality from the z(2 ) pure gauge theory to the 3d ising model on finite triangulations .",
    "we derived explicit expressions for the coefficients which relate the partition functions , in a manner which is valid for general triangulations .",
    "the expression depends on the topology of the lattice only through simple combinatorial properties , namely , the number of faces and links of the lattice .",
    "we also considered a modified z(2 ) higgs - gauge theory on finite triangulations , for which the higgs coupling @xmath129 is variable along the lattice , being proportional to the number @xmath21 of faces meeting at the link @xmath27 , @xmath310 .",
    "this theory was found to be dual to an ising model with a variable inverse temperature , coupled to a magnetic field , and to an additional field which describes an area - dependent energy term in the action .",
    "the method we have used to develop these symmetries can be applied to any theory which admits an algebraic interpretation similar to the one given in @xcite for the case of z(2 ) pure gauge theory on triangulations . whether this is the case of more realistic gauge theories is an interesting question . in particular , it is natural to conjecture that dualities in z(n ) gauge theories can be formulated in a similar fashion .",
    "the extension to continuous gauge groups also deserves investigation .",
    "the mathematical prescriptions we have used do not pose any obstruction for the application to the case of non - commutative gauge groups .",
    "duality relations are difficult to be formulated in this case , and our prescriptions might be of help in the study of this subject .",
