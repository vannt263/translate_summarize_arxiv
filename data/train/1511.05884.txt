    "* ) , it is likely that some hvcs are dark matter  confined and represent a portion of the missing dark matter minihalo population @xcite .",
    "the extragalactic ultracompact hvcs in the alfalfa survey , with dynamical masses far exceeding their hi masses , are excellent examples @xcite .",
    "these clouds have @xmath5 to @xmath6  m@xmath7 of hi mass and @xmath8 to @xmath9  m@xmath7 of total mass , making them as massive as dwarf galaxies . even more massive ( in hi )",

    "complex  h , an even more massive hvc presently colliding with the outer disk of the milky way @xcite , has also been suspected of harboring dark matter @xcite .",

    "the dynamical evolution of the cloud ",
    "galaxy collision depends on gravitational , magnetic , and hydrodynamic processes , often working against each other .",
    "the collision of a pure baryonic cloud with a non - magnetic galactic disk shocks and disrupts the cloud while punching a hole in the disk @xcite .",
    "however , a magnetized disk can act as a barrier to penetration of the disk by a dark matter  free cloud @xcite .",
    "conversely , simulations in which the cloud has a dark matter cloud component and the disk has no magnetic field result in a coherent gas cloud appearing on the far side of the disk long after the collision @xcite .",
    "the behavior of a dark matter  confined cloud when impacting a magnetized galactic disk has not been reported previously but is the topic of this work .    using the three dimensional flash eulerian multiphysics simulation package @xcite",
    ", we investigate the behavior of a dark matter  confined hvc",
    "as it collides with a weakly magnetized galactic disk similar in field geometry and gas density to that of the milky way and compare with simulations that exclude one or both the minihalo and the magnetic field .",
    "we describe our simulation techniques and initial parameters in section  [ sec : methods ] , discuss the results of individual simulations in section  [ sec : results ] , and summarize and discuss the ramifications for the smith cloud , infalling dark matter  dominated clouds , and dark matter searches in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "our cloud is patterned after the smith cloud , whose tip is currently located at @xmath10 and whose heliocentric distance is @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "its hydrogen mass exceeds @xmath12 , evenly split between atomic @xcite and ionized @xcite hydrogen .",
    "the observations by @xcite of a significant line of sight enhancement to the magnetic field around the cloud indicate that it is interacting with the local galactic magnetic field .",
    "following @xcite , we model the progenitor cloud as a sphere of 0.5  kpc radius with an initial hydrogen number density of 0.4  @xmath13 , which results in a total baryonic mass of @xmath14  m@xmath1 . in our model ,",

    ", we start the cloud 10  kpc above the midplane of the galactic disk , at a galactocentric radius of 13  kpc ( the galactocentric radius of its prior impact with the disk , as estimated by @xcite ) , with a downward velocity of 200  km  s@xmath16 .    for numerical tractability",
    ", we model the dark matter minihalo using the einasto density profile @xcite : @xmath17\\}$ ] , where @xmath18 defines the nominal density , @xmath19 defines the half - mass radius for an infinite dark matter distribution , @xmath20 defines the ` shape ' of the distribution , and @xmath21 , for @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the models of @xcite suggest that , in order for the smith cloud to survive its passage through the galactic disk , it must have a dark matter mass of @xmath23 to @xmath24  m@xmath1 . in the interest of exploring the sensitivity to the minihalo mass",
    ", we sample three minihalo masses : 0 , @xmath25 , and @xmath24  m@xmath1 . for consistency with the shape parameters used in @xcite",
    ", we use common values of @xmath26 , and @xmath27 in all simulations that include a dark matter minihalo . for the smaller mass minihalos ,",
    "we use @xmath28 ; for the more massive minihalos , we use @xmath29 .",
    "we model the dark matter in flash by approximately ten thousand massive , collisionless particles .",
    "the particles initial positions are generated randomly from the appropriate einasto density profile , centered upon the baryonic cloud . in order to promote minihalo shape stability",
    ", we generate a peculiar velocity for each particle according to a maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "the total velocity of each particle is set as the sum of the random peculiar velocity and the minihalo group velocity of @xmath30 toward the disk .",
    "we model the galaxy s ism as a cool disk @xcite and hot halo @xcite , composed entirely of atomic hydrogen .",
    "we set the gas density distribution , common to all our simulations , as the sum of the disk and halo gas densities .",
    "the density at the midplane within our simulation domain varies smoothly between 9.8 and 6.2 @xmath13 with increasing galactocentric radius .",
    "the density falls smoothly with height , as set by the component models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the temperature is 1100 k at the galactic midplane and it smoothly rises with height above the plane until it reaches @xmath31k at about 1.5kpc above the midplane .",
    "we model the distribution of mass within the galaxy as the superposition of the above  described gaseous components , a stellar component that includes contributions from the bulge , thin and thick disks @xcite , and halo @xcite , and a dark matter component whose distribution was adopted from @xcite with parameters from @xcite .",
    "the masses of these components sum to @xmath32 .",
    "we used this distribution of mass to calculate the galaxy s gravitational acceleration , @xmath33 , as a function of position in cylindrical polar coordinates .",
    "the galactic gravitational acceleration in our simulations is thus self - consistent with the observation  based mass distribution in our model . in order to obtain the gravitational acceleration at any spatial point",
    ", we first calculate the 3d gravitational acceleration due to our mass model on an @xmath34-@xmath35 grid with azimuthal symmetry and dimensions of @xmath36 , resulting in @xmath37 , with the @xmath38 representing the cartesian unit vectors .",
    "we then fit the grid of @xmath39 with a separate bivariate b - spline for each vector component , @xmath40 .",
    "our model s mass distribution extends out to a galactocentric radius of @xmath41 and height of @xmath42 .    for the runs that include a galactic magnetic field , we implement the coherent magnetic field component of @xcite within the simulation domain .",
    "this model includes spiral geometry in the disk , transitioning to a toroidal geometry for the halo ; it also includes an ` ' -shaped poloidal component .",
    "it is important to note that the coherent field is roughly 15 to 20% of the total field ; the remaining components of the @xcite model are the isotropic random and striated random fields .",
    "the latter two components of the magnetic field are not included in the simulations presented here due to numerical instabilities associated with turbulent flow of the random field components under an ideal mhd evolution framework .",
    "thus , we characterize the magnetic field used in our simulations as weak .",
    "we use flash version 4.2 in three dimensions with a cartesian coordinate system .",
    "the procedural evolution of the runs within flash varied slightly , employing either the unsplit hydrodynamic or the unsplit staggered mesh ideal mhd solver , as appropriate .",
    "we use the adiabatic ideal gas equation of state ( eos ) with an adiabatic index @xmath43 of @xmath44 .",
    "we neglect cooling . in order to account for both the dynamic internal mass and the static external galactic mass",
    ", we implemented a new gravity solver in flash that combines the built  in barnes - hut tree poisson solver for self - gravity with the interpolated gravitational acceleration due to our galactic mass model , yielding the total gravitational acceleration . in our simulations , we ignored the radial component of the galaxy s gravitational acceleration , setting @xmath45 , in order to minimize radial motion and thus keep the simulation domain smaller and the spatial resolution acceptable with the available computational resources .",
    "the self - gravity component of the acceleration vector is unrestricted in direction . while the baryonic mass in the simulation domain contributes to both the self - gravity and the external gravity source ( via the galactic mass model ) , the effect of this double counting on the simulation dynamics is expected to be small .",
    "the cloud s dark matter minihalo and the galactic dark matter halo are the dominant components of the self- and external gravity fields , respectively , and are not affected by this double counting .",
    "we performed a suite of simulations whose identification numbers , dark matter mass , and presence of magnetic field are listed in table  [ table : runs ] .",
    "table  [ table : runs ] also notes the baryonic mass of the cloud , @xmath46 , at various stages of evolution .",
    "our method for calculating the baryonic cloud mass from the simulational data was to integrate the gas density in three dimensions over a sphere of @xmath47 radius .",
    "the sphere was centered on the dark matter minihalo barycenter for runs 36 . for completeness",
    ", we performed our cloud mass calculation upon the runs without minihalos and listed the results along with those of the other runs in table  [ table : runs ] .",
    "for these runs ( runs 1 & 2 ) , the sphere was centered either on the baryonic cloud , or , if no cloud was obvious , on the lowest @xmath35 point of the bubble s shell ( thus the point most similar to that in runs 36 ) for pre - collision and post - collision epochs , respectively .",
    "we did not subtract any ambient baryonic mass that the sphere contained . the dark matter ",
    "free runs develop at a slower rate after the collision than do the runs with minihalos , requiring an additional 7  myr to reach the same level of maturity .",
    "therefore , the epoch labeled @xmath48 in table  [ table : runs ] corresponds to a simulation time of 52  myr for runs 1 & 2 and 45  myr for runs 36 .",
    "epochs labeled @xmath49 and @xmath50 correspond to 35 and 75  myr , respectively , for all runs .",

    "the galactic magnetic field model of @xcite has azimuthal variations in strength and direction of the field .",
    "we chose the galactocentric azimuthal angle to roughly agree with that of the point of impact 70 myr ago shown in @xcite , figure 3 .",
    "the minihalos are necessarily constrained by the size of the domain and fill spheres of @xmath71 radius ( the domain half - width ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : t0myr ] , the minihalo barycenters are indicated by the ` ' markers , and their simulation domain half - mass radii ( distinct from @xmath19 ) are shown as black circles .",
    "all six clouds behave similarly as they fall through the halo .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : t35myr ] which shows the clouds at epoch @xmath49 ( 35  myr ) , just before impact .",
    "as they pass through the halo , the clouds lose material due to ram pressure stripping . by epoch",
    "@xmath49 the clouds with minihalos have lost 1618% of their original baryonic mass , while those without have lost @xmath7236% ( see table  [ table : runs ] ) . during this stage ,",
    "the effect of the weak magnetic field is merely to become swept up and wrapped around the cloud .",
    "this is similar to the behavior in the 2d mhd simulations of @xcite .",
    "each of the clouds approaches the disk with a similar velocity ( @xmath72300  km  s@xmath16 ) .",
    "however , the dark matter confined clouds are more compact and contain more baryonic mass and so carry larger kinetic energy densities than the dark matter  free clouds .",
    "the collision of the cloud with the galactic disk occurs at 36myr for those runs with a minihalo , and 37myr for the dark matter ",
    "free runs . at the moment of collision",
    ", the minihalo separates from the cloud gas and continues , unhindered , through the galactic disk . during the collision ,",
    "the gas cloud ceases to exist as it mixes with and transfers momentum to the disk gas .",
    "this results in a hole in the disk and a long  lived , bubble  shaped structure filled with moderately dense ( @xmath720.1 to @xmath723  h  @xmath13 ) , cool gas ( @xmath721000  k ) below the disk , as shown in figure  [ fig : t45myr ] at 52  myr for runs 1 & 2 and 45  myr for runs 36 ( epoch @xmath48 ) .",
    "these structures are composed of a mixture of gas from both the cloud and the disk , with the majority of their mass originating from the disk .",
    "@xcite found similar structures in 2d hydrodynamic simulations of dark matter ",
    "free clouds colliding with the galactic thin disk .    over time , each minihalo gravitationally accretes gas from its surroundings . by epoch",
    "@xmath48 , the minihalos have trapped an amount of baryonic mass equivalent to 2.8 to 12% of the original baryonic cloud mass . see table  [ table : runs ] .    for runs 36 ,",
    "the magnetohydrodynamic and dark matter gravitational forces continue to influence the evolution of the gas density distribution long after the collision ( figure  [ fig : t45myr ] to figure  [ fig : t75myr ] ) .",
    "the minihalo s gravity continues to tug on the gas at the bottom of this bubble  shaped structure while magnetohydrodynamic forces slow its horizontal expansion .",
    "although the gravitational tug elongates this structure in simulations 36 relative to those in runs 1 & 2 , it can not do so indefinitely .",
    "eventually it pulls off a small , comet - shaped fragment . in run 4",
    ", the fragment completely separates from the bubble  shaped structure , but in runs 3 , 5 , and 6 , a drip - line of gas connects the fragment to the bubble  shaped structure . in runs 3 & 4 , where the minihalo mass is @xmath73 , the newly accreted baryonic mass is very small , only 1.9 and 0.50% of the original baryonic mass , respectively . in contrast , the @xmath74 more massive dark matter minihalos in runs 5 and 6 allow them to accrete gas from the surrounding galactic halo , bringing the mass of their freshly formed clouds to 16 and 12% , respectively , of their original baryonic masses by epoch @xmath50 ( 75  myr ) .",
    "it has been suggested that a dark matter minihalo `` shepherded '' the smith cloud through the outer disk , that the minihalo then ballistically traveled through the halo , dragging the gas cloud along with it , and that they are now poised to fall into the disk again . in order to examine the passage of a dark matter enshrouded smith cloud - sized gas cloud through the outer portion of a magnetized galactic disk , we performed a series of simulations , some with a weak galactic magnetic field and some with a dark matter minihalo . in all cases , the cloud s collision with",
    "the disk punches a hole in the disk , obliterates the cloud , and produces a large bubble  shaped distribution of cool gas below the disk .",
    "when a dark matter minihalo is present , it gathers material from the bubble into a comet  shaped density enhancement that travels with the minihalo .",
    "in addition , if the minihalo is extremely massive , it later accretes some gas from the galactic halo , and the head of the cloud likely remains co  located with the minihalo .",
    "it is thus a prime target for dark matter signal searches .",
    "it should be noted that the simulation with a low mass minihalo and a galactic magnetic field ( run 4 ) shows indications that the gas currently confined by the minihalo may be stripped out by the galactic magnetic field on time scales longer than we simulated , resulting in the minihalo leading the cloud .",
    "however , in none of our cases is the final mass of baryonic material accompanying the minihalo more than 16% of the primordial cloud mass or 40% of the observed smith cloud mass .",
    "the presence of even a weak galactic magnetic field reduces the amount of gas that accompanies the minihalo , irrespective of minihalo mass .",
    "it should be noted , however , that only the coherent component of the galactic magnetic field is modeled in this work . if the random components of the @xcite model were to be included as well ( for fixed minihalo mass ) , then the net strength of the magnetic field in the disk and halo would have been @xmath726 times greater and would have resulted in a smaller final cloud mass .    under the premise that the smith cloud previously passed through the galactic disk accompanied by a dark matter minihalo ,",
    "our simulations indicate that the observed gas comprising the smith cloud must have been accreted onto the minihalo since its disk passage .",
    "this implies that the metallicity of the smith cloud should be similar to that of the galactic ism along its trajectory , rather than primordial in nature .",
    "our simulations favor the larger mass minihalo under this premise , as it is likely that the galactic magnetic field would prevent the lower mass minihalo from accumulating the amount of gas observed .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the premise is not correct and the smith cloud was not accompanied by a dark matter minihalo , then it would not have survived passage through the galactic disk , irrespective of the presence of a magnetic field . in that case",
    ", the smith cloud must currently be on its first descent into the disk .    from the galactic point of view , the remnant bubbles of hvc  disk collisions grow to heights of 3 to 7  kpc . based in",
    "extended simulation times on runs 1 , 3 , and 5 , these structures should survive for @xmath7250  myr ( for hvcs without dark matter ) to @xmath7260  myr ( for hvcs with dark matter ) .",
    "if hvc material were to collide with a weakly magnetized galactic disk at the rate of 1  m@xmath1yr@xmath16 @xcite in @xmath75m@xmath1 clouds as in our simulations , we would expect @xmath7210 to 12 extant bubbles at any given time , for purely dark matter ",
    "free and purely dark matter  rich hvc ",
    "disk collisions , respectively . the number of hvc collision  driven bubbles would be affected by the actual galactic magnetic field strength ( a stronger field would result in fewer bubbles at any given time ) , the number of hvcs reaching the disk , the baryonic mass and size of impacting hvcs , and the proportion of gas  bearing minihalos on collisional orbits .",
    "our simulated hvc collision  driven bubble structures are reminiscent of the supergiant shells ( sgss ) observed in the milky way @xcite and elsewhere ( e.g. , lmc : @xcite ; m31 : @xcite ; ic 2574 : @xcite ) .",
    "young sgss are likely to contain hot gas @xcite and have enhanced metallicities due to supernova activity . evolved sgss are likely to have cool interiors due to metal line emission @xcite or blowouts @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we predict that hvc collision  driven structures would have cool interiors and galactic or sub  galactic metallicities . in principle , one could perform a search for hvc collision  driven shell structures within the population of galactic or extragalactic sgss .",
    "using the discriminants outlined above , such a search may allow one to identify candidate structures and constrain the rate of infalling gas  bearing minihalos .",
    "our simulations show that the majority of the infalling hvc gas will merge into the galactic disk .",
    "although the collision blows an enormous bubble , most of the bubble material will eventually fall back into the disk .",
    "only a small amount of hvc plus galactic material will be carried away with the dark matter minihalo .",
    "hvc - disk collisions are thus efficient mechanisms for contributing gas to the galactic disk , supporting future star formation .",
