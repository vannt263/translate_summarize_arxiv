    "@xcite a wigner molecule can be inferred from the modifications induced on the transport properties .",

    "<S> the transport properties of an interacting one - dimensional quantum dot capacitively coupled to an atomic force microscope probe are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the dot is described within a luttinger liquid framework which captures both friedel and wigner oscillations . in the linear regime , we demonstrate that both the conductance peak position and height oscillate as the tip is scanned along the dot . </S>",
    "<S> a pronounced beating pattern in the conductance maximum is observed , connected to the oscillations of the electron density . </S>",
    "<S> signatures of the effects induced by a wigner molecule are clearly identified and their stability against the strength of coulomb interactions are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> while the oscillations of the peak position due to wigner get enhanced at strong interactions , the peak height modulations are suppressed as interactions grow . </S>",
    "<S> oscillations due to friedel , on the other hand , are robust against interaction . </S>"
