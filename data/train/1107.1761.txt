    "the study of entangled quantum states of systems consisting of two or more parts is a central problem in quantum information theory .",
    "the schmidt decomposition provides a fairly complete characterization of the pure states of a bipartite system .",
    "however , mixed states on bipartite systems and pure states on systems of three or more parts present a much more difficult problem  see @xcite for a comprehensive review  and",
    "a relatively complete understanding of the situation exists only for some very special cases .",
    "the present paper considers the special case of ( pure ) stabilizer states on @xmath0 qudits , each of dimension @xmath1 , and addresses the problem of characterizing the corresponding tripartite state when the @xmath0 qudits are partitioned into three disjoint sets @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , and arbitrary unitary transformations are allowed on each of the three parts .",
    "the case of qubits , @xmath2 , was studied by bravyi et al .",
    "@xcite , who showed that such a stabilizer state is equivalent , up to local unitaries on the three parts , to a tensor product of pure unentangled single qubit states ; maximally entangled two - qubit states or epr pairs , with one qubit in one part and the other qubit in a different part ; and ghz states on three qubits , one lying in each part . in this paper",
    "we generalize these results to the case @xmath6 , where @xmath1 is either a prime or a squarefree integer ( i.e. , not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1 ) .    the stabilizer formalism @xcite was first introduced to simplify the construction and analysis of quantum error correction codes .",
    "soon thereafter it was generalized from qubits to higher dimensional qudits @xcite .",
    "most of the codes known when the formalism was introduced , and the majority of those discovered since , are stabilizer codes .",
    "the formalism has also been used for measurement - based quantum computation @xcite and fault - tolerant topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "there has been a lot of research on single - qubit local unitary ( lu ) and single - qubit local clifford ( lc ) equivalence of qubit stabilizer states / graph states @xcite but here we consider partitionings where each part can have several qudits and arbitrary gates acting on qudits belonging to the same part are permitted .",
    "in @xcite we studied a class of channels obtained from qudit stabilizer ( equivalently , additive graph ) codes where a subset of the carrier qudits is lost .",
    "we fully characterized their information carrying capacities in terms of _ subset information groups _",
    ", a concept related to the notion of correctable algebras introduced in @xcite .",
    "we also provided an efficient algorithm to find the subset information group . in this paper",
    "we adopt the name _ stabilizer code channels _ for such channels .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ section2 ] introduces various concepts that will be used later : pauli and clifford operators , one- and two - qudit gates , stabilizer and graph states .",
    "it also contains some mathematical results , one of which , corollary [ corollary5 ] , is of some interest by itself : it allows the decomposition of stabilizer states into a tensor product of such states when @xmath7 is a product of mutually coprime factors . in the following section [ section3 ] we prove that any bipartite stabilizer state in the case of squarefree @xmath1 is equivalent , up to unitaries on the two parts , to a collection of unentangled single - qubit states and maximally entangled epr pairs",
    "this could have been studied using the schmidt decomposition , but the techniques used here are also needed in the following section .    the central result of this paper is the tripartition theorem  [ theorem7 ] stated and proved in section [ section4 ] .",
    "it shows that when @xmath1 is squarefree a stabilizer state on three parts can be decomposed into a tensor product of single - qudit states , two - qudit epr pairs and three - qudit ghz states . with the help of choi - jamiokowski isomorphism or map - state duality , this result",
    "is applied in section [ section5 ] to the stabilizer code channels where we show they can always be decomposed into a product of a perfect quantum channel , a perfectly decohering channel , and a depolarizing channel ( not all of which need be present ) .",
    "we also prove that the subset information groups corresponding to a stabilizer code channel and its complementary channel obey a duality relation , in that one completely specifies the other .",
    "while the results are specific to stabilizer code channels , we show that they can also be used to provide bounds on channel capacities for some other cases .",
    "section [ conclusion ] summarizes our findings and suggests some directions for future research .",
    "most of the following preliminary concepts have been introduced in @xcite , @xcite and we present them here again for completeness .",

    "this determines the quantum and classical capacities since , e.g. , the quantum capacity of @xmath404 is just the number of epr pairs that can be extracted from the @xmath3-@xmath4 bipartition of @xmath352 multiplied by @xmath413 , while the classical capacity is the quantum capacity plus the number of ghz states linking @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",

    "similarly , by considering the subcode @xmath460 one can identify a ghz state in the corresponding tripartition , and thus deduce that the classical channel capacity of @xmath404 and of @xmath417 is at least @xmath459 .",
    "working from the other direction , one can also consider stabilizer codes that _ contain _ @xmath450 as a subcode . provided these stabilizer codes",
    "are not the whole hilbert space , useful upper bounds on channel capacities of @xmath404 and @xmath417 can be calculated .",
    "the most important results of our paper are those in corollary  [ corollary5 ] , theorem  [ theorem7 ] , and theorem  [ theorem9 ] .",
    "the first of these allows stabilizer states for composite @xmath1 to be expressed as tensor products of stabilizer states associated with the different prime factors of @xmath1 .",
    "this is a valuable technical tool used later in the paper , but also a helpful conceptual tool as it allows more complicated cases to be `` pulled apart '' into simpler situations . for example",
    ", a graph state for @xmath151 can be regarded as the tensor product of @xmath2 and @xmath461 graph states .",
    "our main result , theorem  [ theorem7 ] , that a tripartite stabilizer state can be considered the tensor product of single - qudit states , two - qudit epr pairs and three - qudit ghz states , generalizes the @xmath2 ( qubit ) result in @xcite to any squarefree @xmath462 .",
    "this allows us to provide a very simple and essentially complete characterization , theorem  [ theorem9 ] , up to unitaries on the input and output , of channels constructed from stabilizer quantum codes .",
    "knowledge of the information carrying properties of such a channel leads immediately tells one the properties of the complementary channel , and there is a simple relationship between the corresponding subset information groups introduced in @xcite .",

    "there are various directions in which one might hope to extend these results .",
    "we have encountered technical difficulties in attempting to generalize our tripartition theorem from squarefree to arbitrary composite @xmath1 , where it may no longer be true .",
    "it follows from corollary [ corollary5 ] that it is sufficient to resolve the situation in which @xmath1 is a prime power , so if that could be solved one could have results that apply for general @xmath1 .",
    "can any of our results be extended beyond the narrow confines of stabilizer states ?",
    "the fact that the proofs depend heavily on group - theoretical properties makes this seem unlikely , but it would certainly be of interest to understand what it is that makes stabilizer states so special , and stabilizer quantum codes so useful .",
    "another possible direction is to move on from tripartitions to those involving four or more parts . here",
    "the results in @xcite for qubits suggest a situation that is distinctly more complicated than found for bipartitions and tripartitions , and @xmath462 is unlikely to be simpler .",

    "it is crucial to first note that there are _ two _ different notions of tensor product used in the statement of the theorem and in this proof .",
    "the first and more obvious notion is the tensor product of @xmath0 qudits , each of dimension @xmath1 .",
