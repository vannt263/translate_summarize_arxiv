    "hydrodynamic flows with relativistic velocities are essential feature of modern astrophysics and physics of ultra - relativistic mucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "description of such objects as active galactic nuclei , quasars and microquasars , supernova collapse and explosion , gamma ray bursts , pulsar winds , extragalactic jets is impossible without using of relativistic hydrodynamics ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . also relativistic hydrodynamics is widely used for description of multiparticle production in high energy nucleus - nucleon collisions in the way firstly proposed by landau @xcite . since",
    "then 3d hydrodynamics is applied to study the hadronic spectra and momentum correlations , radial and elliptic flows in relativistic processes of nuclear collisions ( see , e.g. review by kolb & heinz @xcite ) .",
    "diversity of complex micro- and astro- physical relativistic processes requires development of reliable and universal ( applicable to all range of initial thermodynamic conditions and velocity distributions ) numerical methods for equations of relativistic hydrodynamics    relativistic hydrodynamics numerical calculations have already a rich history .",
    "the first methods of numerical treatment of equations of relativistic hydrodynamics were based on introduction into equations an artificial viscosity @xcite .",
    "this allows to make initially hyperbolic equations of hydrodynamics parabolic and as a result discontinuous features like shock waves become continuous .",
    "but in such methods viscosity should be chosen separately for every particular task introducing thus an element of art in science and making corresponding code difficult for application .",
    "another difficulties are loosing energy due to viscosity and problems with ultrarelativistic regime ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . and finally there is a danger of losing causality when one passes to the relativistic equations of parabolic type @xcite .",
    "eventually artificial viscosity methods were replaced by more advanced ones .",
    "one of well - known and successful methods is sph ( smooth particle hydrodynamics ) , see refs .",
    "the obvious disadvantages of sph are the use of lagrangian coordinates , problems with resolution at low densities and and still need for an artificial viscosity at high mach numbers .",
    "another class is hrsc ( high resolution shock capturing ) schemes based on godunov method .",
    "our method is an hrsc one .",
    "the main idea of godunov method is introduction of riemann problems - ones of the simplest possible initial value problems for hyperbolic systems - at cell boundaries in order to compute fluxes .",
    "but complete solution of the riemann problem is a non trivial task .",
    "thus many methods have been developed in order to avoid solution of the riemann problem .",
    "a comprehensive review can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the most obvious way of simplifying the task is a proper linearization of initially non - linear system .",
    "roe - type solvers ( following the original work by roe @xcite ) reduce the nonlinear system of hydrodynamics equations to a locally linear system where the linear jacobian matrix is chosen in such a way that a non - linear shock is a single discontinuity for the linear system too",
    ". generalization of the method to equations of relativistic hydrodynamics was made in ref .",
    "another method of local linearization based on using primitive variables instead of conservative ones and applying either hlle - type or roe - type solver was proposed in refs .",
    "though linearized methods are numerically efficient and robust , they can generate unphysical states with negative energy density .",
    "it means that additional efforts should be made to handle strong enough rarefactions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "hlle method @xcite is based on approximate handling of the riemann problem by introduction of an intermediate state and two waves propagating with some signal velocities .",
    "extension of the method to relativistic hydrodynamics was made in refs . @xcite .",
    "quality of the scheme depends on choice of signal velocities thus making it a bit of art .",
    "the scheme also does not take into account presence of a contact discontinuity in real solution of the riemann problem .",
    "it leads to a bad resolution of contact discontinuities in particular and to high numerical diffusion in general .",
    "this problem is partially lifted in recently developed hllc numerical scheme @xcite where contact discontinuity is present in solution of the riemann problem .",
    "hlle method was applied for relativistic heavy ion collisions by rischke @xcite",
    ". a higher order extension of hlle metod , ppm ( piecewise parabolic method ) was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and used for description of ultra - relativistic a+a collisionsby @xcite .",
    "another approach to approximate solution of the riemann problem is two - shock approximation @xcite .",
    "this method ignores presence of rarefactions and take solution of the riemann problem consisting only of shock waves .",
    "such approach works quite well for shock configurations but starts having problems for configurations with strong enough rarefactions due to violation of entropy condition",
    ". additional work like making entropy fixes should be done to repair this .",
    "finally , an approach that does not consider the riemann problem at all , is also possible .",
    "this is flux splitting method ( see ref .",
    "the method splits the flux into right going and left going parts in a way that satisfies conservation laws and conforms with the wave structure of the flow .",
    "one of the best realizations of this method is marquina flux @xcite .",
    "marquina - type flux is the base of the code genesis @xcite .",
    "another problem in constructing a numerical code is the choice of accuracy .",
    "accuracy is achieved by proper reconstruction of quantities inside a numerical cell or a proper reconstruction of fluxes if a flux splitting method is used .",
    "there are high order accuracy eno ( essentially non - oscillatory ) @xcite and weno ( weighted eno ) schemes @xcite .",
    "the recent achievements here are the ram code @xcite and the wham code @xcite both of 5-th order accuracy .",
    "it is thought that high accuracy helps in simulating flows with different energy scales .",
    "we use a second order accuracy scheme by falle & komissarov @xcite with a non - linear riemann solver .",
    "this solver is constructed in such a way that it is an approximate solver in case of non - zero tangential velocities and an exact solver in case of zero ones ( including one - dimensional flows ) .",
    "this gives us an advantage of equally good treating of difficult situations such as ultrarelativistic flows , strong shocks and rarefactions . in our general scheme",
    "we incorporate the source term in right hand side of hydrodynamics equations aiming utilization of the code for description of the physical processes where such a source is required .",
    "it concerns , in particular , the matter evolution in ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions.our paper is organized as follows .    in section 2 the basic equations of relativistic hydrodynamics and their numerical treatment are presented . in section 3 an exact riemann solver for one dimensional flows",
    "is constructed .",
    "section 4 contains description of treatment the special case of equation of state @xmath0 . in section 5",
    "we present how our scheme interacts with vacuum . in section 6",
    "we give the approximate method of including tangential velocities .",
    "section 7 describes how to convert conservative variables into primitive ones . in section 8",
    "the method of including a source term is given .",
    "section 9 is devoted to testing our code on several examples of one - dimensional flows .",
    "in section 10 we test our code on three - dimensional flows .",
    "section 11 summarizes the results of the paper .",
    "our task is to numerically simulate the system of equations of relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "it can be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is energy - momentum tensor of ideal fluid , @xmath3 is energy density taken in the rest frame of a fluid element , @xmath4 is pressure , @xmath5 is baryonic number density taken in the rest frame of a fluid element , @xmath6 is 4-vector of fluid velocity and @xmath7 is the metric tensor that in case of flat space - time has the form @xmath8 .",
    "we use such notations that greek indices take values from 0 to 3 and latin ones from 1 to 3 ( are the space coordinates ) .    equations ( [ cov_num ] ) must be supplemented by conservation equation for baryonic number @xmath9 the system ( [ cov_num])-([bar ] ) is full and represents five equations for the set of five independent variables @xmath10 .",
    "this set is called primitive variables .",
    "the system ( [ cov_num])-([bar ] ) is a system of conservation laws and can be rewritten as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the vector of different five independent variables that are called conservative variables and @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 are the vectors of fluxes in @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions respectively .",
    "there are numerous numerical methods for simulation of conservation systems . as a basis",
    "we implement a godunov - type method , described by falle & komissarov @xcite in one- and two - dimensional cases .    in order to construct a numerical scheme for system ( [ cons ] ) we divide numerical domain into cells with size @xmath19 along the x - axis , @xmath20 along the y - axis and @xmath21 along the z - axis . knowing solution at time @xmath22 we want to find solution at time @xmath23 .    integrating ( [ cons ] ) in time from @xmath24 to @xmath25 and in space over domain @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 we obtain the following exact relation @xmath29 here @xmath30 @xmath31",
    "@xmath32 @xmath33 note that in the right side of ( [ f_num])-([h_num ] ) there is integrating in time and conservative numerical methods differ from each other just in ways of estimating these integrals .    as a first order scheme we use the following method .",
    "we put that inside of a cell there is a uniform distribution of conservative quantities equal to @xmath34 . in this case on every cell boundary we have a discontinuity that sets up a riemann problem .",
    "we have to solve it in order to estimate fluxes ( [ f_num])-([h_num ] ) . for this",
    "we solve a one - dimensional riemann problem in every space direction .",
    "indeed , to obtain , for instance , @xmath35 we suppose that in a neighborhood of discontinuity the flow depends only on @xmath16 and not on @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath36 which is true as the distribution of quantities inside a cell is uniform .",
    "after we have solved the riemann problem , on the place of a discontinuity we obtain a state @xmath37 and the corresponding flux is @xmath38 similarly we find @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    in order to construct a second - order scheme we have to introduce a structure inside a cell and to let quantities change during a time interval @xmath41 .    the second order in time",
    "is achieved by using a first order scheme to get an intermediate solution @xmath42 at time @xmath43 and by applying it to finding fluxes .    in order",
    "to achieve the second order in space we approximate the quantities inside a cell by linear functions . in doing",
    "so we must be cautious not to break scheme s monotonicity .",
    "this is important because non - monotonic schemes lead to artificial oscillations in neighborhood of shock waves and contact discontinuities . in order not to allow such effects an averaging function",
    "is used to calculate cell gradients that compares gradients in neighboring cells and chooses the smallest one .",
    "doing so we have @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 where the averaging function @xmath47 must have the following properties @xmath48 there exist an infinite number of such functions .",
    "we use one of the simplest variants that has the following form @xmath49 after we have calculated gradients ( [ grad_x])-([grad_z ] ) we can find second order left and right states for a cell boundary riemann problem . for example , when estimating @xmath35 we assume @xmath50 @xmath51 correspondingly @xmath52 similar relations are applied to find @xmath39 and @xmath40 . as we said above , application of quantities with time index @xmath53 in order to find fluxes warrants the second order of the scheme in time .    note",
    "that in relativistic hydrodynamics the condition @xmath54 must be held in order to obey causality principle .",
    "in general , however , applying relations ( [ ql])-([qr ] ) may violate it .",
    "in such cases we have to additionally adjust slopes in order to hold ( [ q1 ] ) .",
    "thus we have a complete numerical second order scheme .",
    "the only missing constituent is the procedure of calculating solution of a riemann problem a riemann solver . having it at hand we can find @xmath55 and then find fluxes and then move one step further in time .",
    "in this section we formulate a procedure of finding solution of a riemann problem .",
    "we call our solver exact in a sense that numerical methods are applied to exact relations that describe a riemann problem solution .",
    "this differs our method from numerous approximate riemann solvers that use approximate relations for estimating intermediate state @xmath56 .",
    "as was said above , we need to construct an algorithm for a one - dimensional riemann problem . for this",
    "we consider the following system @xmath57 where @xmath58 @xmath59 as we see , all the quantities here depend only on @xmath24 and @xmath16 and velocity has only the @xmath16-th component denoted as @xmath60 .",
    "the influence on solution of non - zero tangential velocities @xmath61 and @xmath62 will be considered later .    for the system ( [ one - dim ] ) we state the following initial conditions at initial time @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are some constant states",
    ".    quite often numerical solution of ( [ one - dim])-([rim ] ) is based on a linear approximation .",
    "we too base our idea on solution of a similar problem for a linear system .",
    "it is well known that for linear systems , systems with @xmath67 , @xmath68 being a constant matrix , solution of problem ( [ one - dim])-([rim ] ) consists of 3 discontinuities ( or @xmath5 discontinuities for systems of @xmath5 equations ) divided by domains of constant flows ( see figure  [ f : waves ] ) .",
    "but in case of a nonlinear problem there arise continuous self - similar solutions called simple waves .    at this point in order to be able to move further we need to say that only so - called thermodynamically normal media are the subject of present study .",
    "medium is called thermodynamically normal when the following condition holds @xmath69 where @xmath70 is so - called generalized specific volume and @xmath71 is entropy .",
    "condition ( [ bethe ] ) means that only compression shock waves and rarefaction simple waves are physical .",
    "rarefaction shocks are nonphysical in the sense that entropy of a fluid element decreases when crossing a shock front .",
    "compression simple waves are nonphysical in the sense that wave profile becomes singular at a definite moment of time .",
    "media with violated condition ( [ bethe ] ) are called thermodynamically anomalous .",
    "the consideration here is similar to the thermodynamically normal case with only change that physical are rarefaction shocks and compression simple waves .",
    "cases when for some parameters relation ( [ bethe ] ) holds and for some parameters is violated are more complicated and are the subject of further investigation .",
    "this is of importance because equations of state where exists a phase transition represent both normal and anomalous behavior at different values of thermodynamical parameters .    nevertheless from the point of view of pure mathematics",
    "both compression and rarefaction shocks exist as generalized solutions of equations ( [ one - dim ] ) .",
    "it means that we can search for pure shock wave solution of problem ( [ one - dim])-([rim ] ) , and at this point not take into account how physical are its constituents .    indeed , a discontinuity @xmath72 is a generalized solution of system ( [ one - dim ] ) if @xmath73 where @xmath74 is propagation speed of discontinuity and in linear case @xmath75 is just an eigenvalue of matrix @xmath68 .",
    "arbitrary states @xmath65 and @xmath66 in general does not satisfy ( [ shock ] ) .",
    "but they can be sewn together through two intermediate states @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( see figure  [ f : waves ] ) .",
    "then we have the following system of algebraical equations @xmath78 @xmath79",
    "@xmath80 this is system of 9 equations for 9 unknown variables - @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "once have solved it , we have a pure shock wave solution of a riemann problem ( [ one - dim])-([rim ] ) .",
    "taking into account that wave 2 must be a contact discontinuity for which @xmath84 , @xmath85 , the number of equations in ( [ 1])-([3 ] ) can be reduced to 7 .",
    "the system ( [ 1])-([3 ] ) is written in terms of conservative variables @xmath86 but in our code is solved in terms of primitive variables @xmath87 . in ultra - relativistic case we use instead of @xmath60 @xmath88-factor @xmath89 .",
    "so , after we have solved ( [ 1])-([3 ] ) , we have @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath81 , @xmath83 , @xmath94 .",
    "the numerical method we use to solve ( [ 1])-([3 ] ) is the newton method .",
    "an obvious difficulty here is how to choose an initial approximation .",
    "as we have a set of 7 equations its quite a non - trivial problem . in some cases , when our initial approximation appears to be bad , the method fails . in such cases",
    "we use a switch to the alternative method of finding @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath81 , @xmath83 , @xmath94 .",
    "it is based on relations that connect variables on both sides of a shock wave and on a well known fact that across a contact discontinuity pressure and velocity are continuous .",
    "first , note , that shock speeds @xmath81 , @xmath83 and velocity @xmath94 can be explicitly expressed in terms of thermodynamical variables .",
    "so , as a matter of fact we need 4 equations to find @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "the first two equations we take from hugoniot relations and obtain @xmath95 @xmath96 here we used the fact that on contact discontinuity @xmath84 .",
    "this gives us the third equation @xmath97 the fourth equation we obtain from relation @xmath98 .",
    "the velocity of fluid behind the shock front ( marked by index 2 ) in the rest frame of fluid ahead of the shock front ( marked by index 1 ) is @xmath99 where the sign is defined by two factors- whether the shock is compression or rarefaction one and what direction does it go , right or left .",
    "then the fourth equation is written as @xmath100 depending on situation there can be 4 combinations of signs .",
    "shocks speeds @xmath81 and @xmath83 can be written as @xmath101 and @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the speed of the shock front in the rest frame of fluid ahead of a shock ( marked by 1 ) and the sign is `` - '' when a shock moves in the rest frame to the left ( applies to shock wave 1 ) and is `` + '' when a shock moves to the right ( applies to shock wave 3 ) .",
    "thus , we have constructed a purely shock wave solution for a riemann problem .",
    "but the real solution of a riemann problem ( [ one - dim])-([rim ] ) consists not only from shocks . in general , for a normal medium , waves 1 and 3 can be either compression shocks or rarefaction simple waves .",
    "thus , the next step is to find real pattern of waves .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "we presented a numerical code with a new riemann solver .",
    "this solver is exact for one - dimensional flows .",
    "exactness means that we use real wave patterns in order to obtain fluxes .",
    "such an approach allows us to treat correctly vast range of velocities and configurations .",
    "testing shows that the scheme works correctly in ultrarelativistic regimes and is capable of correct catching strong shock waves as well as strong rarefactions . in this sense",
    "our scheme is universal and can be applied to simulations of processes with large gradients of quantities and with large difference in velocities . also",
    ", it account for possible source terms in right hand side of hydrodynamics equations . and the fact that the method uses physical considerations makes it especially reliable . on the other hand due to necessity of solving non - linear algebraical equations",
    "our code is more numerically expensive than the methods like hlle or flux splitting even though no matrix decomposition is needed .",
    "but drastically increased efficiency of computers makes it possible to apply methods like ours .",
