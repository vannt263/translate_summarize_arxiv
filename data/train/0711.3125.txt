    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are large - scale structures carrying plasma and magnetic field from the sun . cmes are associated with flares , filament eruptions , shocks , radio bursts , solar energetic particle ( sep ) events , and have been found to be the primary cause of major geomagnetic disturbances and changes in the solar wind flow ( see , _ e.g. _ , schwenn _ et al .",

    "radio type iii bursts are fast frequency - drifting features that can be used as tracers of energetic electrons as they are caused by subrelativistic ( @xmath02.5 to @xmath080 kev ) electron streams travelling outward from the sun at speeds of about 0.1c to 0.5c ( see , _ e.g. _ , wild , @xcite ; dulk , @xcite ) . near - relativistic electrons ( 30315 kev ) can be observed _ in situ _ during sep events , in association with type iii bursts that continue into the ip space ( simnett @xcite ) .",
    "radio type ii bursts , on the other hand , are thought to be caused by mhd shock waves propagating through the corona and interplanetary medium ( _ e.g. _ , nelson and melrose , @xcite ) .",
    "some studies suggest that coronal metric type ii bursts and interplanetary ( ip ) decameter ",
    "hectometer ( dh ) type ii bursts do not have the same driver ( _ e.g. _ , cane and erickson , @xcite ) , and that the latter are exclusively created by the cme bow shocks ( _ e.g. _ , cliver , webb , and howard , @xcite ) .    seps are believed to be accelerated in the lift - off phase of cmes , which could include either acceleration in flaring processes ( _ e.g. _ , de jager , @xcite ) , acceleration in coronal / interplanetary shocks ( _ e.g. _ , reames , @xcite and references therein ) , or in both ( _ e.g. _ , klein and trottet , @xcite ; klein _ et al .",

    "recently , the role of cme interaction in sep production has also been discussed ( _ e.g. _ , gopalswamy _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ; kahler , @xcite ; wang _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite , and references therein ) . one of the difficulties in determining the relevant processes lies in the uncertainties of timing .",
    "seps are typically released no earlier than the maxima of the flare impulsive phases ( kahler , @xcite ) , yet at the time of sep release the height of the associated cme can vary from one to over ten solar radii ( kahler , @xcite ; krucker and lin , @xcite ; huttunen - heikinmaa , valtonen , and laitinen , @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been observed that different particle species can be released non - simultaneously ( huttunen - heikinmaa , valtonen , and laitinen , @xcite ; krucker and lin , @xcite ; mewaldt _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ) .",
    "the _ in - situ _ observations of seps are strongly influenced by the magnetic connection between the spacecraft and the flare site ( _ e.g. _ , cane , reames , and von rosenvinge , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the nominally well - connected area for the spacecraft in the l1-point is around 60@xmath1 west on the solar hemisphere",
    ". found that at larger angular distances between the observer s magnetic footpoint and the flare location , the onsets of energetic particles in relation to the microwave maximum are more delayed , and the proton onsets are relatively more delayed than the electron onsets . assuming that seps originated from the flaring processes , concluded that the propagation of @xmath020 mev protons from the flare site to the connecting magnetic field line is systematically slower than of @xmath00.5 mev electrons , and the electron - to - proton ratio tends to increase with angular distance from the flare site",
    "of course , the modern view of particle acceleration in the solar corona does not rely on flares as the only source of energetic particles during sep events .",
    "thus , instead of reflecting the azimuthal particle propagation conditions in the corona , the findings of kallenrode can be re - interpreted as reflecting the azimuthal and/or temporal evolution of the source , usually a coronal shock wave driven / launched by a cme ; a delay between the plasma eruption and the observed onset of the sep event reflects the establishment of the magnetic connection between the source and the observer and/or the efficiency of the acceleration and escape of particles in different parts ( bow / flanks ) of the global coronal shock wave .",
    "consistent with the current views and the conclusions of are the results of , who found that in some events the injection time of the electrons is consistent with the timing of the type iii radio emission , while in other cases the electrons were apparently released up to half an hour later than the start of the type iii burst .",
    "the non - delayed electron events were concentrated in the well - connected area , while the delayed events were more spread out .",
    "similar delays were also observed between protons and helium nuclei by .",
    "the near - simultaneous proton and helium events originated from the well - connected area , and the events with delayed helium nuclei were more spread out .    in this paper",

    "the electron release times would have been earlier , at 13:31 ut @xmath10 8 minutes , but most likely the high value of the path length is caused by an inaccurate determination of the onset times in the low - energy electron channels due to the long rise time and high background level of the fluxes .",

    "the observed start frequency of the second type iii burst group , around 60 mhz near 13:48 ut , suggests that electrons were accelerated near heliocentric distances 1.31.8 r@xmath12 ( with all the above - mentioned density models considered ) .",
    "the third type iii group started at a much higher frequency , near 250 mhz at 14:05 ut , with bursts that showed both positive and negative frequency drifts .",
    "this high frequency indicates a low heliocentric height for acceleration , @xmath291.2 r@xmath12 , with all the density models considered .",
    "the sequence of the observed features is listed in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the narrow - band fluctuations inside the drifting envelope started at 13:09 ut , which is during the flare impulsive phase and also near the time of the estimated halo cme launch time .",
    "radio pulsations can be due to magnetic reconnection , and recently have associated this with plasmoid formation .",
    "the projected radio sources of this emission were above the active region , which is where the halo cme most probably originated .",
    "the source heights for the fluctuations are uncertain , since the observed plasma emission could also reflect the density of the dense active region loops , along which beams of particles were travelling . as the bursts within the envelope had both positive and negative frequency drifts , it is possible that magnetic trapping was present .",
    "the drifting radio feature started next , at 13:14 ut near 500 mhz , which suggests a lower height in the atmosphere compared to the earlier narrow band fluctuations .",
    "the estimated speed for the burst driver is difficult to calculate because of the high starting frequency ( high frequencies and high densities require that the standard atmospheric models have to be multiplied by arbitrary adjustment factors ) . from the frequency drift and the density scale height",
    "we can make a rough estimate that the speed was around 1420 km s@xmath13 . in the radio images the projected source speed was similar",
    ", 12001400 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the source trajectory suggests that this feature could have been associated with the eit wave .",
    "the eit wave features appeared near the locations of the drifting burst sources at 13:17 ut , near the bright euv `` rim '' shown in figures [ fig:7 ] and [ fig:9 ] .",
    "unfortunately we could not calculate the speed of the eit wave , as it was observed very near the solar limb .",
    "the halo cme speed was much higher than the estimated speed of this radio source , and the main halo - cme loop was also moving more to the west compared to the motion of the radio source .",
    "the radio source could also be showing a filament trajectory , as the observed euv ribbons indicated a filament eruption .",
    ".summary of observations related to the 9 november 2002 event [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the dh type ii burst that we were able to follow from 14 mhz down to 2 mhz , after which it was still observed as patchy emission down to kilometer waves , looks to have a clear association with the cme front .",
    "the estimated burst heights fit well with a cme bow shock scenario .",
    "the deduced type ii burst driver speed at 13:2313:47 ut ( @xmath02070 km s@xmath13 ) is not too far off from the plane - of - the - sky cme leading front speed measured at 13:3113:42 ut ( 1895 km s@xmath13 ; acceleration to 2000 km s@xmath13 near 30 r@xmath12 ) or the measured cme lateral expansion speed , @xmath02300 km s@xmath13 before 14:00 ut .",
    "the height  time profiles of the type ii burst and the cme suggest that both were formed during the flare impulsive phase .",
    "a timing match between the flare impulsive phase and the cme acceleration phase have been noted by , _",
    "e.g. _ , .    the onset time analysis for protons gives the most probable acceleration time around 13:5714:27 ut .",
    "the best candidate for the accelerator is the propagating cme bow shock , visible as the ip type ii burst . near 14:00 ut",
    "when the protons could have been released , the ( projected ) white - light cme front was located at height @xmath09 r@xmath30 , and the type ii burst height was approximately 79 r@xmath30 ( actual number depending on the density model used ) .",
    "we emphasize that between 14:06 and 14:40 ut no other radio signatures were observed in the dynamic spectra .",
    "the two type iii burst groups that were observed to start at metric wavelengths ( at 60 and 250 mhz ) and continued to ip space suggest that electrons were accelerated at low heliocentric heights where they had access to open field lines .",
    "low acceleration heights have been reported earlier by , and their results of acceleration heights were between 0.1 and 0.5 r@xmath12 above the photosphere agree with our estimates .",
    "they claim that acceleration usually happens well after the flare maximum .",
    "the velocity dispersion analysis for the electron data , using the low path length obtained from the proton analysis , gives an estimate for the time of electron release at 13:4014:03 ut .",
    "this time range agrees with our observations of the type iii burst group observed to start at 13:48 ut .",
    "the start of the next type iii burst group ( 14:02 ut ) is somewhat late compared with the estimated electron injection time , but it is still possible .",
    "acceleration happens well after the flare maximum ( 13:23 ut ) in this case .",
    "but , if we accept the high path length obtained from the analysis of electron data only , the release time ( 13:2313:39 ut ) will match with the flare maximum .",
    "have suggested that accelerated electrons can be injected into the earth - connected flux tube when a coronal transient ( eit wave ) hits the field lines . in our case",
    "we see the eit wave passing the southwest `` rim '' approximately around 13:2513:48 ut , but there is uncertainty due to the poor eit image cadence .",
    "this time frame agrees with the estimated electron injection times with both the low and high path lengths and is close to the start time of the first type iii burst group .",
    "however , since the origin of euv emission is relatively low in the solar atmosphere compared to the observed radio emission of the first two type iii burst groups , the association remains questionable .",
    "one lasco image shows that the halo cme had a brightening on the side where the earlier , slower cme was propagating .",
    "this brightening appears between the available lasco c2 images at 13:31 and 13:54 ut .",
    "since the latitudinal and longitudinal distance between the two cme source regions was only 2040@xmath1 , it is possible that the halo cme interacted with the earlier cme or with a streamer located in the northwest .",
    "a shock front could have formed in the interaction region , due to compression .",
    "the radio enhancement was observed during 13:3013:40 ut at 3565 mhz , where the corresponding heliocentric height is around 1.52.0 r@xmath12 . at 13:54 ut the white - light brightening on the cme side had a height of @xmath04 r@xmath12 .",
    "the deduced speed of the disturbance , if the radio feature and the white - light brigtening were connected , is approximately 11001500 km s@xmath13 .",
    "we also observed tilted type iii burst lanes at times when the type iiis passed the ip type ii burst .",
    "after the tilt , some of the type iii burst lanes brightened .",
    "we present in figure [ fig:13 ] one possible geometry leading to the observed dynamics .",
    "our sketch also explains the observed bidirectional motion of the metric type iii bursts : +  electrons are accelerated in the possible reconnection site a2 in the low corona , where they have access to open magnetic field lines ( some open field lines were present in the potential magnetic field maps prior to the event ) .",
    "the electron beams stream both upwards and downwards , as observed in the dynamic spectra and verified in nrh radio images .",
    "site a1 is also a possible reconnection site , because of the open field lines near the active region that produced the earlier cme1/earlier observed streamer region .",
    "since a1 site is located higher in the solar atmosphere than site a2 , a1 could be the acceleration region for the second type iii burst group ( start frequency near 60 mhz ) and site a2 could be the the acceleration region for the later birectional type iii burst group ( start frequency near 250 mhz ) .",
    "+  accelerated energetic electrons then enter the compression region b which is behind the shock front driven by cme2 .",
    "the result is a bending of the type iii burst lanes as the density gradient along the line of force is diminished .",
    "particles propagate ahead of the shock wave , to region c , and experience a sudden decrease of the local density and magnetic field .",
    "this in turn results in a drop of plasma frequency and focusing of the electron beam .",
    "the latter , in turn , leads to a more efficient generation of langmuir waves and , hence , a re - brightening of the radio burst upstream of the shock front .",
    "the release times for solar energetic particles , electrons and protons , can be obtained from , _",
    "e.g. _ , velocity dispersion analysis .",
    "the feasibility of this method can be argued , as the path lengths can vary and there can be unknown propagation effects in the ip space . in our analysis protons in the 1480 mev energy range yield path lengths of 1.01.4 au , while the analysed electrons suggest much higher path lengths of 2.42.7 au .",
    "the path lengths of course have a strong effect on the estimated release times : with the low path lengths , electrons would be released just before the protons , and with adopting the high path lengths just for the electrons , electron release would have preceded proton release by more than half an hour .    very high path lengths are usually taken as an indication of not - so - accurate timing results ( lintunen and vainio , @xcite ; saiz _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ) .",
    "high path lengths can be the result of delayed onset observation on low - energy channels due to high pre - event backgrounds , high contrast between the spectral indices of pre - event background and the sep event , prolonged injection of the particles , or interplanetary scattering of the particles . therefore the release times yielded by the lower path lengths are more plausible .",
    "we do not speculate on the idea of a `` seed population '' for the released particles , although there is the possibility of injecting ( flare ) particles into the corona where the particles get accelerated later .",
    "the timing and the high start frequencies of the metric type iii bursts that continue to the ip space suggest , however , that at least the energetic electrons are accelerated low in the corona and after the flare maximum .    in summary , from the estimated release times for the electrons and protons compared with the multi - wavelength signatures of flare and coronal mass ejection processes ,",
    "we conclude that electrons were most probably accelerated at low coronal heights in the wake of a fast halo - type cme  the source region could be reconnecting structures either on the side of the cme or near its legs  and that the best candidate for proton accelerator is the cme bow shock , at a time when the cme was propagating high in the corona , above 9 r@xmath30 .    the tilts and brightenings in the type iii bursts at the times when they pass the ip type ii burst is a new observation .",
    "we have presented a possible geometry leading to the observed dynamics , and point out that the tilted type iii bursts can reveal propagating shock fronts in cases when the type ii burst lanes are not visible in the spectrum .",
    "we thank the radio group at lesia , observatoire de paris , france , for the use of nanay radioheliograph and decameter array data , and the soho / ephin instrument team and the _ wind_/3dp instrument team and the coordinated data analysis web ( cdaweb ) for providing the particle data .",
    "klein and r. gmez - herrero are thanked for fruitful discussions .",
