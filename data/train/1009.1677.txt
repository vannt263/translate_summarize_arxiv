    "understanding the effect of randomness and disorder remains one of the main challenges in condensed matter physics and materials science .",
    "one issue that has attracted much attention recently concerns ordering processes , relaxation phenomena , and the formation of domains in disordered systems .",
    "examples include vortex lines in disordered type - ii superconductors,@xcite polymers in random media,@xcite coarsening of disordered magnets,@xcite and slow dynamics in spin glasses.@xcite    our understanding of relaxation phenomena and aging processes in non - frustrated systems with slow dynamics has greatly progressed during the last decade , mainly through the systematic study of critical and coarsening ferromagnets ( see [ ] for a review of the field ) .",
    "whereas aging in perfect , i.e. non - disordered , systems is now very well understood , this is different for disordered systems where almost every aspect of non - equilibrium relaxation remains under debate .",
    "already the growth law governing the coarsening process of disordered ferromagnets below their critical temperatures is at the center of some controversy .",
    "monte carlo simulations of various disordered ferromagnetic ising models @xcite found for the dynamical correlation length @xmath2 a power - law increase , @xmath1 , with a non - universal dynamical exponent @xmath3 that depends on temperature and on the nature of the disorder .",
    "this behavior can be explained by assuming that the energy barriers grow logarithmically with @xmath0.@xcite as a consequence , it follows that the dynamical exponent @xmath3 should be inversely proportional to the temperature : @xmath4 .",
    "whereas this temperature dependence has been observed in the cardy - ostlund model,@xcite a careful study @xcite has revealed that in the random - bond ising model the temperature dependence of the dynamical exponent is more complicated .",
    "this fact points to the existence of conceptual problems in the approach of paul _",
    "et al_.@xcite in addition , an algebraic growth - law is in strong contrast to the classical theory of activated dynamics that , under the assumption of energy barriers growing as a power of @xmath0 , predicts a slow logarithmic increase @xcite of this length : @xmath5 , with the barrier exponent @xmath6 .",
    "new insights into this matter have come very recently through a series of papers on the dynamics of elastic lines in a random potential.@xcite these papers provide convincing evidence for a dynamic crossover between a transient regime , characterized by a power - law growth with an effective dynamical exponent that depends on the disorder , and the asymptotic regime where the growth is logarithmic in time .",
    "this result strongly suggests the possibility that a similar crossover could take place in disordered ferromagnets and that the observed power - law regime with non - universal dynamical exponents is not the asymptotic regime .",
    "however , as the transient regime is already extremely long - lived for the elastic line,@xcite it is expected that the asymptotic regime is not easily accessible in simulations of coarsening ferromagnets . nevertheless , it can well be that on the time scales accessible in relaxation measurements a crossover takes place .",
    "another question concerns the scaling behavior of two - times quantities encountered in disordered ferromagnets relaxing towards equilibrium . in many systems",
    "it is empirically observed that in the aging regime the autocorrelation function @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the waiting time and @xmath9 is the observation time , behaves like @xcite @xmath10 \\label{eq : gen_scal}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a scaling function , @xmath12 is a free parameter and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are constants.@xcite depending on the value of @xmath12 , different situations are summarized by eq .",

    "one recovers a standard simple aging behavior where the autocorrelation is only a function of the ratio @xmath18 .",
    "this is the behavior encountered in many systems , and in particular in the perfect ferromagnets undergoing phase ordering .",
    "finally , for @xmath19 one has a superaging behavior .",
    "this is a rather hypothetical scenario as kurchan has proven an exact lemma @xcite that states that under very general conditions a superaging behavior of the autocorrelation can not exist ( this prove can also be extended to response functions @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore intriguing that a study of the autocorrelation in the two - dimensional random - site ising model @xcite yielded data to which one can fit the superaging scaling form @xmath20\\bigr)\\ ] ] with @xmath12 slightly larger than 1 .",
    "however , in the random - bond ising model the autocorrelation displays a simple aging behavior @xcite in full analogy to what is observed in the pure model.@xcite these differences in the observed scaling behavior of different disordered ferromagnets remains to be explained .",
    "finally , some coarsening ferromagnets with weak randomness @xcite ( as for example the random - bond or the random - field ising models ) have been shown to display a _",
    "behavior : scaling functions of space- and time - dependent quantities are independent of disorder and temperature provided that distances are measured in units of the dynamical correlation length @xmath2.@xcite this has been verified in various coarsening systems both for one - time @xcite and two - times quantities,@xcite but it is an open question how general this result really is .    in this paper",
    "we are revisiting the random - site ising model in two dimensions .",
    "our simulations reveal that for this system the apparent power - law growth of the dynamical correlation length @xmath2 only holds in the early stages of the coarsening process and that notable deviations are already encountered for moderate values of the correlation length . as a consequence",
    "one can not naively assume that @xmath1 , as done in previous studies,@xcite but instead the correct time dependence @xmath2 has to be used in the investigation of the scaling behavior of two - times quantities .",
    "when doing this , a simple aging behavior emerges for the autocorrelation function in the scaling limit , thereby showing that the previously proposed superaging scenario is not appropriate for the description of aging in diluted ferromagnets relaxing towards equilibrium .",
    "we extend our study to the time integrated linear response and to the space - time correlation function and find that both quantities also show a simple aging scaling .",
    "finally , we also investigate a possible superuniversal behavior in diluted ferromagnets and show that the space - time correlation functions for a fixed degree of dilution but different temperatures fall approximately on a common master curve .",
    "this is in contrast to data obtained for different dilutions for which a data collapse is not observed .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . in the next section",
    "we introduce the model and the quantities ( autocorrelation , space - time correlation , autoresponse ) that we study in order to elucidate the aging and dynamical scaling properties of diluted ferromagnets . in section",
    "iii we present the results from our extensive numerical simulations . as a function of dilution and temperature",
    "we determine the dynamical growth law as well as non - equilibrium exponents and establish the scaling behavior of the various quantities .",
    "finally , section iv gives our conclusions .",
    "we consider in the following the two - dimensional random - site ising model @xcite on a square lattice ( we set the lattice constant to one ) with the hamiltonian @xmath21 where the sum is over nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "@xmath22 are the usual ising spins and @xmath23 are quenched random variables taken from the distribution @xmath24 .",
    "for @xmath25 we of course recover the standard ising model on a square lattice . if the system is diluted , i.e. if @xmath26 , one still observes a phase transition between a disordered high temperature phase and an ordered low temperature phase for all @xmath27 .    in our simulations",
    "we prepare the system in a fully disordered state , corresponding to infinite temperature , and then bring it in contact with a heat bath at a temperature @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the critical temperature for the dilution @xmath30 . after the quench , the system is evolved with the standard single spin flip metropolis algorithm ( in order to check that our conclusions are independent of the update scheme we also did a large number of runs with the heat - bath algorithm ) , and the relaxation of the system towards equilibrium is monitored through the study of the autocorrelation , the space - time correlation and the thermoremanent susceptibility .",
    "the two - time autocorrelation function is given by the expression @xmath31 where the sum is over the @xmath32 lattice sites and @xmath33 is the value of the spin at site @xmath34 at time @xmath35 .",
    "for all studied quantities we have to average over both the thermal noise ( indicated by @xmath36 ) and the site disorder ( indicated by @xmath37 ) . in order to get a more complete picture of the relaxation processes ,",
    "we extend our study to the two - time space - time correlation function @xmath38 finally , we also investigate how the system reacts to a perturbation by adding a small spatially random magnetic field @xmath39 , @xmath40 , at the moment of the quench.@xcite this field is turned off after the waiting time @xmath8 after which we measure the decay of the time - dependent thermoremanent susceptibility @xmath41 where an additional average over the random field , indicated by @xmath42 , has to be performed .",
    "the results reported in the next section have been obtained for systems composed of @xmath43 spins .",
    "we carefully checked that no finite - size effects show up in our simulations for this system size .",
    "we considered three different degrees of dilution : @xmath44 , 0.8 , 0.75 , and three different temperatures for every @xmath30 value : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "for the autocorrelation and the space - time correlation we averaged typically over at least 1000 independent runs , thereby considering waiting times @xmath8 up to 20000 mcs , with a total running time of @xmath51 mcs ( as usual , time is measured in monte carlo steps , one mcs corresponding to @xmath32 proposed updates of the system ) .",
    "we also studied the corresponding quantities with @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as well as the one - time quantity @xmath55 . for the autoresponse we used @xmath56 ( we checked that we are in the linear response regime for that strength of the random field ) and averaged at least over 10000 independent runs .",
    "we thereby considered waiting times up to @xmath57 and observation times again up to @xmath58 .    before closing this section , we briefly summarize for later the scaling forms expected for our quantities in case of a simple aging scenario . in the aging regime we have that @xmath35 , @xmath8 , and the difference @xmath59 are large compared to any microscopic time scale .",
    "if simple aging prevails , one expects that the autocorrelation scales as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a non - equilibrium exponent and @xmath62 is a scaling function which displays a power - law in the long - time limit : @xmath63 for @xmath64 . here",

    "it is important to note that the scaling form ( [ eq : cscal ] ) _ assumes _ a power - law growth law of the dynamical correlation length : @xmath1 .",
    "however , as we shall see , deviations from a simple power - law growth of the dynamical correlation length already show up for moderate values of @xmath0 .",
    "a more general scaling form in terms of the correlation length , valid in the scaling regime @xmath68 , is given by @xmath69 with @xmath70 for @xmath64 .",

    "@xmath73 can be replaced by @xmath74 resp .",

    "finally , for the thermoremanent susceptibility , which as a time integrated response is related to the autoresponse @xmath77 by @xmath78 , one should have that @xmath79 in the dynamical scaling regime .",
    "the scaling function @xmath80 is asymptotically given by a power - law decay , @xmath81 for @xmath64 , with the autoresponse exponent @xmath82.@xcite again , in case @xmath1 , one can write this in the widely used form @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath64 . in the perfect two - dimensional ising model",

    "in the following we first discuss the time dependence of the correlation length before studying in a systematic way the scaling behavior of the various two - times quantities introduced in the previous section .",
    "we obtain the dynamical correlation length @xmath2 in the usual way @xcite by monitoring the one - time space - dependent correlation function @xmath88 we define the correlation length @xmath2 as the distance at which @xmath89 drops to half of the value it has at @xmath90 , see the inset in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows in a log - log plot @xmath0 as a function of @xmath35 for some of the cases studied in this work . in all cases",
    "the initial behavior can be described by a power - law , but deviations from this algebraic growth already show up when the correlation length is of the order of a few lattice constants .",
    "these deviations indicate a slowing down of the domain growth after an initial transient behavior .",
    "for example , when plotting for @xmath91 ( the case where the deviations are the most notable ) @xmath92 as a function of @xmath93 , one observes that the data for large times approach a straight line with an effective slope of approximately 2.5 at the end of the run .",
    "even though this slope is smaller than the value @xmath94 expected from the work of huse and henley @xcite , it is worth stressing that the observed behavior is indeed compatible with a slow crossover to a logarithmic growth @xmath95 .",
    "still , much longer times are needed in order to unambiguously characterize this asymptotic regime .",
    "as the power - law increase is only a transient one , it is not really meaningful to determine an effective dynamical exponent @xmath3 from this time - dependent length , as this would only be valid in a certain time window.@xcite in fact , as we shall see in the following , it is the naive use of an effective algebraic growth law that is responsible for much of the confusion surrounding the scaling behavior of disordered systems .",
    "indeed , the correct scaling forms are only revealed when the correct growth law @xmath2 is properly taken into account .",

    "interestingly , the values of @xmath65 and @xmath82 for a fixed dilution are within error bars independent of the temperature , with @xmath140 .",
    "this is in agreement with the intuitive picture that the dynamical correlations in the diluted ferromagnets are mainly governed by the average size and shape of clusters that are occupied by spins .",
    "the values of @xmath65 are always found to be larger than the lower bound @xmath113 derived in [ ] , similar to what is observed in the random - bond model @xcite .",
    "this corrects an earlier claim @xcite that in diluted magnets this bound is violated . for the exponent @xmath119 , on the other hand , we find that its value depends on the dilution as well as on the temperature .",
    "this is similar to the reported behavior of that exponent in the random - bond ising model,@xcite even though one has to view these results for the random - bond system with some caution as in that analysis a simple algebraic growth of the correlation length has been assumed . in any case , due to our high quality data and our careful analysis , we can exclude for the random - site model that the values of @xmath119 are independent of dilution and temperature and that they are equal to 1/2 .",
    "the attentive reader will have noticed that we did not try to compare the numerically determined scaling functions with theoretical predictions , as for example those coming from the theory of local scale invariance.@xcite the reason for that is the non - algebraic growth that prevails in our system .",
    "indeed , the theory of local scale invariance , which gives explicit predictions for scaling functions in aging systems , predictions that have been found to be valid in many theoretical and numerical studies,@xcite assumes in its present formulation the presence of a unique length scale that grows as a power - law of time .",
    "it is an open and important question whether that theoretical approach can be generalized to include cases where the growth is non - algebraic .    besides the disordered magnets , many other disordered systems , as for example vortex glasses in high - temperature superconductors,@xcite coulomb glasses,@xcite or spin",
    "glasses,@xcite are undergoing ordering processes which have been characterized by an ( effective ) growth law with a temperature and disorder dependent exponent .",
    "our results indicate that one has to be very careful in this type of situation as the effective dynamical exponent presumably only masks the presence of a transient initial time regime , followed by a crossover to a slower asymptotic growth regime . when studying the dynamical scaling behavior one should not naively assume an effective growth law , but instead the correct growth law , determined numerically if the exact expression is unknown , should be used .",
    "a revisitation of these models and a careful analysis along the lines done here for the random - site ising model seems needed in order to fully clarify the scaling properties of the various disordered systems .",
