    "ever since the experimental verification of @xmath2 symmetry in optical structures @xcite , complex optical potentials have been the subject of much attention for the past 5 - 6 years or so @xcite .",
    "this is primarily because of the mathematical isomorphism between the quantum mechanical schrdinger equation and the paraxial equation of propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a medium , viz . , @xmath24 \\psi = e \\psi\\ ] ] where @xmath25 represents the envelope function of the amplitude of the electric field , @xmath26 is a scaled propagation distance which plays the role of time @xmath27 in quantum mechanics , @xmath28 denotes the spatial coordinate , and @xmath29 is the optical potential of period @xmath30 , proportional to the refractive index @xmath31 of the material through which the wave is passing .",
    "a complex @xmath32 corresponds to a complex refractive index @xmath33 , where @xmath34 represents the constant substrate background index , with @xmath35 being associated with gain or loss .",
    "additionally , @xmath36 . to be more precise , @xmath37 $ ] , with @xmath38 . for @xmath2 symmetry ,",
    "the gain and loss regions need to be carefully configured so that @xmath39 , _ i.e. _ the real part @xmath40 should be even and the imaginary part @xmath41 odd .",
    "( [ opt ] ) describes bragg scattering of matter waves from a complex potential in the non - interacting regime , e.g. , dilute cold atomic beam .",
    "it may be mentioned that the complex potential arises from the interaction of near resonant light with an open 2-level system .",
    "thus bragg scattering of optical waves in 1-d bragg grating structure is similar to scattering of matter waves in the framework of eq .",
    "( [ opt ] ) .",
    "two of the most prominent features explored in non hermitian quantum systems are : +   ( i ) _ exceptional points _ ( ep ) in the discrete spectrum , also referred to as hermitian degeneracies , where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce with the variation of a system parameter . + ( ii ) _ spectral singularities _ ( ss ) in the continuous part of the spectrum , which correspond to resonance states with vanishing spectral width .    _",
    "exceptional points _ and _ spectral singularities _ are mathematical concepts with intriguing physical realizations .",
    "while energy values switch from real to complex conjugate pairs at an ep , reflection and transmission coefficients blow up at ss . in various studies on complex crystals with periodic potentials , the physical implications of spectral singularities have been investigated @xcite .",
    "ss , which are actually lasing thresholds , are known to spoil the completeness of bloch - floquet states in non - hermitian hamiltonians with complex periodic potentials .",
    "the onset of spectral singularities in complex crystals ( occurring at the @xmath2 symmetry breaking point ) is found to be associated with secularities that arise in bragg diffraction patterns .",
    "experimentally , spectral singularities can be revealed in diffraction experiments on non hermitian systems with complex potentials , by the appearance of a secular growth of the amplitudes of waves scattered off the lattice when it is excited by a plane wave at special incident angles .",
    "recently mostafazadeh has shown that nonlinear spectral singularities are intensity dependent , corresponding to emission of waves with a particular wavelength - amplitude profile @xcite .",
    "in particular , for a kerr nonlinearity , the author showed that the first order perturbative equation that determines the nonlinear ss provides an explicit expression for the intensity of emitted waves from an infinite planar slab of gain medium .    in most of the studies done on optical potentials so far @xcite , the general interest lies in obtaining the band structure for complex periodic potential of the type @xmath42 with period @xmath43 , where @xmath5 represents the lattice amplitude and @xmath13 is a measure of the strength of the non hermitian part of the potential , i.e. , the gain - loss periodic distribution .",
    "for the hermitian case , there is no gain - loss modulation , and @xmath44 .",
    "the reason for the widespread interest in the particular potential given in eq .",
    "( [ schro - opt ] ) above , lies in the fact that it gives many physically interesting results , especially highlighting unusual diffraction and transport properties of complex optical lattices . in various studies for this potential , using spectral techniques and detailed numerical calculations ,",
    "the @xmath2 threshold @xmath45 has been identified , below which all eigenvalues for every band and every bloch wave number are real ( unbroken @xmath2 phase ) and all the forbidden gaps are open , whereas at the threshold @xmath45 , the band gaps vanish @xcite . on the other hand , beyond this value ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) @xmath2 symmetry is spontaneously broken , energies turn complex and the bands start merging together forming oval - like structures . subsequently , in an analytic study on this particular potential @xcite , the authors found the existence of a second critical point at @xmath47 , beyond which no part of the band structure remains real .",
    "our aim in this work is to look for the effect of the @xmath2 phase transition on the continuous part of the spectrum .",
    "motivated by the physical importance of ss mentioned above , we shall focus our attention on the scattering amplitudes  reflection @xmath0 and transmission @xmath1  in our effort to search for spectral singularity . for this purpose",
    ", we shall consider an optical structure having a @xmath2 symmetric potential given in eq .",
    "( [ schro - opt ] ) above , confined between two bounding walls at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , embedded in a homogeneous medium having uniform potential @xmath5 ; i.e. , @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "it may be mentioned that in @xcite the author carried out an asymptotic analysis of the above potential in the entire crystal for the particular value @xmath16 , and showed the existence of an infinite number of spectral singularities in terms of the secular growth of the wave amplitude . in @xcite analytical expressions",
    "were obtained for the reflection and transmission coefficients for @xmath16 , in terms of modified bessel functions . while examining unidirectional invisibility",
    " identically unit transmission , zero reflection from one side and enhanced reflection from the other  they investigated how the enhanced reflection from one side comes about from a wave packet as opposed to a plane wave . in yet another study @xcite , the authors considered bounding walls at @xmath53 , and showed the phenomenon of unidirectional reflectivity .",
    "however , our present work significantly differs from these earlier studies : while ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite consider the potential to be valid in the entire region , we consider bounding walls at @xmath48 and @xmath54 . additionally , these studies are for the critical value @xmath55 only .",
    "we consider all possible values of @xmath13 , both above , below and at the critical point .",
    "regarding ref .",
    "@xcite , though the potential considered there is similar to that studied in this work , nevertheless , ours is a direct method as against their numerical simulation ; we determine analytical expressions for the reflection and transmission coefficients , in terms of mathieu functions and their derivatives .",
    ".2 cm    the article is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly discuss the different parameter regimes of @xmath13 , to obtain the solutions in the different cases .",
    "applying the boundary conditions , we determine the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath56 respectively , for @xmath57 , where @xmath58 may be even or odd integer , including the case of a single period @xmath59 , for waves incident from the left as well as right .",
    "our observations are plotted in figures 1 to 7  the real and imaginary parts of @xmath32 are plotted in fig . 1 , whereas @xmath60 and @xmath56 for different @xmath6 are plotted in fig . 2 ( @xmath61 ) , fig .",

    "have shown that all eigenvalues for every band and every bloch wave number are real and all the forbidden gaps are open , for @xmath61 , while the band gaps disappear at the threshold @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "for even number of periodic cells @xmath217 , we observe an interesting phenomenon  viz .",
    ", unidirectional invisibility , similar to the numerical simulations reported in earlier works @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that at @xmath217 , @xmath218 , so that eq . ( [ t - b ] ) and ( [ rr - b ] )",
    "reduce to @xmath219 and @xmath220 , respectively , whereas the expression for @xmath221 in eq .",
    "( [ rl - b ] ) reduces to @xmath222\\ ] ] where @xmath223 .",
    "thus , for right incident waves the potential appears reflectionless : @xmath224 , whereas for left incident waves there is finite reflection @xmath225 as shown in fig .",

    "we checked this numerically also and arrived at a similar result .",
    "this typical phenomenon of unidirectional invisibility  zero reflectance from one side and unit transmittance  is also referred to as an anisotropic transmission resonance ( atr ) @xcite .",
    "this may be seen as a generalization of the flux - conserving transmission resonances of unitary systems ( when @xmath226 ) .",
    "the generalized unitarity relation for 1-dimensional @xmath2 symmetric photonic heterostructures mentioned in eq.([conserve ] ) above , follows naturally .",
    "we must emphasize that the results presented here are based on exact analytical expressions for @xmath227 , written in terms of bessel functions and their derivatives .    finally , fig .",
    "7 shows the reflectance and transmittance in the absence of gain - loss modulation  i.e. , the corresponding hermitian optical potential ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "as expected , there is no left - right asymmetry , and the sum of the scattering coefficients always add up to unity . increasing the size of the periodic structure only increases the number of oscillations in the scattering amplitudes .     and @xmath56 at @xmath228 , for @xmath70   ( a ) @xmath229   ( b ) @xmath230   ( c ) @xmath131,title=\"fig:\",width=4,height=3 ]    and @xmath56 at @xmath228 , for @xmath70   ( a ) @xmath229   ( b ) @xmath230   ( c ) @xmath131,title=\"fig:\",width=4,height=3 ]    and",

    "motivated by the studies on complex crystals , in this work we investigated a @xmath2 symmetric optical potential of period @xmath231 , confined in the region @xmath4 , embedded in a homogeneous medium having uniform potential @xmath5 ; @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "our main emphasis was to look for spectral singularities in the continuous spectrum , and",
    "unidirectional invisibility , if any .",
    "our probe revealed a number of interesting features .",
    "for values of @xmath13 below the critical point @xmath232 the scattering is normal ( @xmath233 ) , whereas it turns anomalous beyond this point ( @xmath234 not necessarily @xmath235 ) .",
    "left - right asymmetry , typical of non hermitian quantum systems is evident in each parameter regime . whereas @xmath236 ( say ) in each case , @xmath237 , as observed in other non hermitian quantum systems .",
    "figures 2 to 7 illustrate our findings .",
    "additionally , this particular model satisfies the modified unitarity relation ( [ conserve ] ) developed in @xcite , in each parameter region .",
    "the critical point @xmath45 shows interesting behaviour in the scattering spectrum . for odd number of cells in the periodic structure @xmath238 , for low values of energy , the reflection and transmission coefficients",
    "oscillate . for large energies",
    ", transmittance reaches unity and reflectance goes to zero : @xmath239 , for waves incident from either right or left .",
    "however , for even number of cells @xmath240 , the potential appears reflectionless when observed from the absorptive ( right ) side : @xmath241 . at the same time",
    ", one observes enhanced reflection when viewed from the emissive ( left ) side , transmission being identically unity ( @xmath242 ) in either case .",
    "our exact analytical results are supported by numerical plots as well .",
    "this phenomenon , generally referred to as unidirectional invisibility , or anisotropic transmission resonance ( atr ) , is a generalization of the flux - conserving transmission resonances of unitary systems ( when @xmath226 ) .",
    "this was reported in earlier studies as well @xcite . however , the results presented here are based on exact analytical expressions .    another interesting observation in this work",
    "is related to spectral singularities , also known as zero - width resonances where @xmath60 and @xmath56 diverge .",
    "these are observed for the parameter regime @xmath46 , at particular values of energy @xmath14 , and are displayed in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "similar to the observation in ref .",
    "@xcite , we found infinite number of spectral singularities .",
    "however , our present study is quite different from that of ref .",
    "@xcite in the sense they studied the unconfined potential , for @xmath243 only , whereas we considered all the parameter regimes @xmath244 , when the periodic potential is embedded in a homogeneous potential of strength @xmath5 , bounded by rigid walls at @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "furthermore , they described ss as the secular growth of the wave amplitude while in the present study ss are associated with the blowing up of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "finally , we observe that for this particular structure no accidental flux - conserving points were found : @xmath247 anywhere .",
