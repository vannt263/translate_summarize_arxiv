    "<S> we review the phenomenology of mini black holes at colliders in light of the latest data from the lhc . by improving the conventional production cross - section , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the current non - observation of black hole signals can be explained in terms of quantum gravity effects . in the most optimistic case </S>",
    "<S> , black hole production could take place at a scale slightly above the lhc design energy . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyse possible new signatures of quantum - corrected planck - scale black holes : in contrast to the semiclassical scenario the emission would take place in terms of soft particles mostly on the brane .    </S>",
    "<S> the main argument in support of mini black hole ( bh ) production@xcite is based on a viable solution of the hierarchy problem of particle physics : by allowing gravity to probe additional spatial dimensions , one can avoid the discrepancy between the electroweak scale and the planck scale , placing quantum gravity phenomenology in reach of current particle accelerators@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such logic , however , is being questioned by the current non - observation of quantum gravity signals at the lhc@xcite , giving the topic of mini bhs a more speculative character with respect to early expectations ( see ref . for recent reviews of the status of quantum gravity and innovative proposals to test it ) .    against this background , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the mechanism of bh production and their associated signatures might be drastically different from what is known to date . </S>",
    "<S> our general argument is based on the fact that semiclassical formulations can not efficiently describe the conjectured quantum gravity at the terascale . </S>",
    "<S> even if we acknowledge the difficulties in predicting quantum gravity phenomenology from first principles ( _ e.g. _ from string theory , loop quantum gravity , _ etc ... _ ) , we recall that irrespective of the specific formulation , quantum gravity exhibits a unique character : the emergence of a minimal resolution length @xmath0 . as a result , one can follow the strategy of improving the existing scenarios by any of the minimal length mechanisms proposed in the literature ( for recent reviews see ref . ) .    </S>",
    "<S> customarily , mini - bh formation is modelled via thorne s `` hoop conjecture '' : a bh forms whenever the impact parameter @xmath1 becomes smaller than the effective schwarzschild radius , @xmath2 , of the two - body colliding system . </S>",
    "<S> while for classical bhs such a conjecture consistently implies a black disk cross section , @xmath3 , in the case of particle collisions quantum effects are expected to be relevant . indeed , the black disk profile leads to the phenomenologically inconsistent result that about @xmath4 would have formed at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) in 1985 , provided additional spatial dimensions are assumed . to overcome this oddity , we recall that even the impact parameter can not be smaller than the minimal length , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> one can thus analytically improve the bh cross section as@xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mandelstam `` invariant mass '' of the colliding two - body system . </S>",
    "<S> the above formula smoothly interpolates the black disk result in the trans - planckian regime and the expected suppression of sub - planckian bhs , without introducing `` by hand '' any threshold function . by setting @xmath8 and considering the current limits on the lhc luminosity@xcite @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> , we can estimate the bh production rate @xmath10 . in doing so , one has also to take into account further quantum corrections to @xmath11 , which departs from the classical linear function of the beam energy @xmath7 due to bh remnant formation@xcite . in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> one has a variety of parameter combinations but @xmath10 turns out to be negligible except for a high number @xmath12 of extra dimensions . for m - theory </S>",
    "<S> inspired @xmath13-dimensional spacetimes , the `` new physics '' might be just behind the corner , _ i.e. _ , @xmath14 for @xmath15 tev . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the resulting suppression _ is _ a genuine effect of quantum gravity while the semiclassical regime occurs at energies well above the terascale .    </S>",
    "<S> another key point that needs revision is the profile of bh emission spectra . </S>",
    "<S> conventionally these are obtained by considering greybody factors resulting from scattering equations on classical higher dimensional bh geometries . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis can not work for planck scale black holes ( qbhs ) : strong quantum effects at scales @xmath16 not only smear out the curvature singularity but modify the global structure of the geometry with consequent horizon extremisation and halted evaporation @xcite . at the level of primary emission , qbhs exhibit a decreased temperature with respect to classical bhs with the same mass </S>",
    "<S> : this implies reduced fluxes of particles and energy both in the brane and in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> such a reduction , however , is not `` homogeneous '' : in marked contrast to the results for schwarzschild bhs@xcite , the ratio of total bulk / brane emission can be seen to decrease rapidly as @xmath12 increases@xcite ( see tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ aba : tbl1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ aba : tbl1 ]    even if our conclusions are based on the primary emission of scalar particles only and a study of the dynamics of the associated chromosphere and photosphere is still missing , we argue that qbhs can be characterized by a distinctive signature , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , a peculiar emission of detectable soft particles mostly on the brane . </S>"
