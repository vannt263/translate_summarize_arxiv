    "single molecule spectroscopy ( sms ) has become a versatile and powerful tool for the study of condensed phase systems in chemistry , physics and biology @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the very qualities that make sms such a powerful technique , have also led to significant theoretical challenges in describing experimental data .",
    "the ultra - microscopic nature of the physical systems under study leads to randomness in the behavior of experimental signals due both to thermal agitation of the photoactive portion of the system and the inherent randomness of the spontaneous emission process itself .",
    "while sms has been hailed for its ability to probe these fluctuations directly , it remains difficult to extract physical pictures for molecular dynamics based solely on sms data streams .",
    "some of this difficulty is likely fundamental ( current sms experiments may not collect sufficient data to allow for direct inversion to molecular dynamics ) , but even if sms data were sufficient to differentiate between all viable physical hypotheses , it remains an open question as to the best means to simulate such models to allow for comparison with experiment . indeed , much effort has been expended on the theory of interpreting / modeling sms trajectories , particularly in the context of stochastic models for chromophore dynamics @xcite .",
    "stochastic models , though certainly illustrative and powerful , ultimately face certain limitations in the modeling of phenomena that are inherently quantum mechanical , such as spectroscopy .",
    "quantum coherence can not be captured , quantization of nuclear eigenstates is not naturally formulated within a stochastic scheme , and the parameters of stochastic models are often difficult to equate with their microscopic origins .",
    "as the following work will show , even stochastic models systematically derived from underlying quantum considerations can lead to quantitative and qualitative differences from fully quantum calculations .",
    "until recently , monte carlo wave function simulations ( mcwf ) @xcite and related techniques provided the only fully satisfactory route to theoretical calculation of single molecule photon counting observables @xcite including quantum mechanical effects .",
    "a few other studies have touched on specific aspects of quantum dynamics applicable to sms @xcite , but without complete generality .",
    "recent work by us @xcite and others @xcite , has established generating function techniques as a general means for calculating statistical quantities of single molecule photon counting experiments .",
    "the only fundamental limitations to this approach are that you must consider the spontaneous emission of photons to be governed by rate processes and the directly calculated quantities are statistical moments of the number of photons emitted @xcite .",
    "the bulk of previous work with the generating function approach has focused on two level chromophores with stochastic modulation by the environment , however the method is equally applicable to multi - state quantum systems .",
    "the extension to multi - state quantum systems was suggested by us @xcite and formally carried out by mukamel @xcite .",
    "sanda and mukamel @xcite have recently used the generating function approach to derive formal perturbative expressions ( in the applied field strength ) for low order photon counting moments .",
    "though interesting from a theoretical standpoint , the derived expressions are complex enough that implementation will be impossible for all but the simplest model systems ( second order moments require solution of a six point quantum correlation function , higher moments need larger correlations ) . as a numerical technique , the generating function approach has promise to study varied systems without limitation to low field strengths .",
    "the present paper considers several model systems to demonstrate the use of the generating function approach as a numerical tool for predicting sms photon counting observables .",
    "in addition to calculation of photon counting moments for broadband detection schemes , as has been considered previously , we also calculate emission statistics for photons specific to particular molecular transitions and degenerate sets of transitions . for systems",
    "where vibrational structure is well resolved compared to natural line widths , this is equivalent to the calculation of spectrally resolved emission statistics . from a conceptual and numerical standpoint",
    "these calculations are no more difficult than broadband detection calculations .",
    "the simulations we have carried out suggest that significantly more information stands to be learned from photon counting experiments when photon statistics are broken down by color .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] presents the underlying theory and notation necessary to introduce our calculations .",
    "although there are many details to be considered here , the conceptual framework for calculating photon statistics in the many - level case is no more complex than for two level chromophores . given the reduced liouvillian operator for density matrix dynamics of the chromophore system , calculation of the generating function for photon number and/or low order statistical moments is immediate .",
    "most of sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] is dedicated to describing the liouvillian operator itself , not the extension of this matrix to calculation of experimental observables .",
    "sections [ sec : tls ] and [ sec : harmonic ] present numerical calculations for chromophores coupled to a two level system and an harmonic vibrational coordinate .",
    "many different regimes are considered , both to display the flexibility of the present formulation in numerical calculations and to highlight differences between fully quantum calculations and commonly employed stochastic approximations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we conclude .",
    "the picture we present is the natural extension of the optical bloch equations to multi - level quantum systems in a condensed phase .",
    "our methodology has been adopted both to make connection with our previous work on two level chromophores @xcite and because the necessary theoretical / computational tools for chromophore dynamics are well established in the literature .",
    "we imagine a single chromophore in a condensed phase environment driven by an external laser field .",
    "it is assumed that the field is strong enough to warrant a classical treatment of this perturbation so that dynamics , in the absence of any other system - field interactions , would be dictated by @xmath0 + \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\boldsymbol{e}(t)\\cdot [ \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}},\\rho].\\ ] ] in the above @xmath1 is the hamiltonian for the unperturbed chromophore - environment system , @xmath2 is the electric dipole moment for this system and @xmath3 is the classical applied laser field .",
    "@xmath4 specifies the density matrix for the molecule only .",
    "this evolution assumes the radiation is of sufficiently long wavelength ( and the chromophore sufficiently localized ) to allow the dipole approximation .    what the above dynamics neglects is the relaxation of the driven molecular system .",
    "the coupling between system and the quantum radiation field provides a route for this relaxation to occur : the spontaneous emission of photons .",
    "it is these photons that are registered in sms experiments and hence inclusion of the spontaneous emission process is absolutely essential . within the standard approximations ,",
    "the quantum radiation field is integrated over to provide rate constants for emission of photons between various molecular transitions @xcite .",
    "this leads to a master equation approach for incorporating emission events as pure rate processes .",
    "the rate for spontaneous emission of a photon , causing a jump from system eigenstate @xmath5 to eigenstate @xmath6 , is calculated by application of fermi s golden rule ( using the coupling between system and quantum radiation field as the perturbation ) @xmath7 the collection of constants appearing in this expression have their usual meaning , but we will not be concerned with them in this work .",
    "what is important to us is the dependence on the transition dipole moment @xmath8 , which serves to mediate relative rates of emission for different chromophore transitions . in principle ,",
    "energy splittings ( @xmath9 ) impact the rates as well , but we shall be concerned with electronic transitions where differences in this quantity between various allowed transitions are much smaller than the splitting itself . in this limit",
    "we expect inconsequential variations on the basis of energy differences .",
    "perturbation theory applied to the entire system density matrix evolution ( as opposed to just a single rate calculation ) additionally tells us that the population lost from state @xmath5 , via @xmath10 decay , ends up in state @xmath6 .",
    "also , it specifies that the @xmath11 transition causes all associated coherences ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) to decay at the rate of @xmath14 .",
    "the net effect of all spontaneous emission processes in the system is the additive contribution of these three effects ( loss of population from state @xmath5 , gain in population of state @xmath6 and loss of coherence for all allowed @xmath15 transitions . )",
    "we neglect radiative level shifts in the system states and ignore all other couplings ( virtual photon transitions ) caused by the presence of the quantum radiation field .",
    "these other couplings are unimportant when system energy levels are non - degenerate as the implied perturbations are non - secular @xcite .",
    "the non - degeneracy condition is met by the systems studied in this work .    keeping those contributions specified in the last two paragraphs , implies that we supplement our chromophore equations of motion with non - hamiltonian evolution terms corresponding to spontaneous emission .",
    "the form of this augmentation is most transparent in the basis of @xmath16 eigenstates . rewriting eq .",
    "[ eq : no_relax ] in this form yields ( the summation convention over repeated density matrix labels is assumed throughout this work . )",
    "@xmath17 here , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are liouville super - operators ( matrices ) corresponding to the commutator expressions in eq .",
    "[ eq : no_relax ] @xcite .",
    "note that our definition incorporates the factor @xmath20 within @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath21 is the matrix effecting spontaneous emission processes .",
    "the elements of this matrix are provided by the arguments of the preceding paragraphs ( @xmath22 assumed in the following ) @xmath23 with all other elements zero .    in what follows , it will be convenient to partition the matrix @xmath21 into its positive and negative pieces , so that @xmath24 with @xmath25 consisting of the terms specified by the second line of eq . [ eq : def_l ] and @xmath26 comprised of the remaining terms from the first and third lines .",
    "one final important point is that while eq .",
    "[ eq : with_q_field_rem ] provides effective dynamics for the system with implications of field fluctuations handled implicitly , this dynamics will still be far too complicated for exact practical treatment when the system of interest is composed of a chromophore embedded in a condensed phase .",
    "the problem is simply one of a complex dynamics associated with a quantum mechanical many body system .",
    "when it is possible to make some effective separation between the relevant part of the system and a weakly coupled ( and fast ) bath this problem can be overcome in exactly the same method employed to remove the radiative field from explicit consideration .",
    "writing @xmath27 for a `` system '' hamiltonian composed of two parts : @xmath28 ( the chromophore which is directly coupled to the applied field ) and @xmath29 ( the bath ) weakly coupled by @xmath30 , we arrive at an equation of motion for the reduced chromophore density matrix @xmath31 through application of standard redfield theory @xcite @xmath32 here , the matrix @xmath33 is the usual redfield matrix to account for bath perturbations on the chromophore and the matrix @xmath34 reflects the entire dynamics for @xmath31 .",
    "we note that additivity of contributions stemming from quantum field , bath and classical ( laser ) field perturbations to the dynamics of the chromophore should be viewed as an approximation of  independent rates of variation \" @xcite .",
    "we neglect frequency shifts of the chromophore due to @xmath30 , so that the labels @xmath35 now correspond to eigenstates of @xmath36 .",
    "we consider this set of approximations as the natural extension of the optical bloch equations to multi - level systems in a condensed phase .",
    "specification of the matrices @xmath37 , @xmath21 and @xmath33 will allow us to apply this formalism to various physical problems and several model systems will be considered in the following sections .      extending the picture of the preceding section to calculation of photon counting statistics for single molecule measurements proceeds in a manner analogous to the case for two level chromophores @xcite .",
    "the formal solution has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and we present here a brief derivation following ref .",

    "imagine a detector capable of differentiating between photons that are emitted for particular chromophore transitions .",
    "in certain cases this would be possible by only selecting photons within a certain frequency window , in other cases this might not be experimentally feasible but should be regarded as a gedanken experiment .",
    "that portion of @xmath34 responsible for placing the chromophore in a lower energy state immediately following the transition of interest is of special importance for calculating statistics associated with this transition . from eq .",

    "when we are interested in broadband detection with all photons counted equivalently , the structure of eq .",

    "we acknowledge that there is an unfortunate amount of machinery behind the calculations that we have presented here , however it is important to stress that 90% of this machinery is associated with the implementation of the redfield formalism ( calculation of the matrix @xmath96 in our notation ) . eqs .",
    "[ eq : newmethod ] are very simply applied once @xmath96 is given ; simply diagonalize the matrix and perform a few simple matrix multiplications as implied by the formulae .",
    "the generating function approach , while necessarily encumbered by the usual difficulties in simulating dissipative quantum systems , adds no new significant conceptual or numerical problems .",
    "photon counting statistics are therefore readily available at no more expense than normally expected for calculation of density matrix dynamics .",
    "this remarkable fact seems to be the strongest point in support of the generating function methodology .",
    "several of our calculations have presented results for emission spectra and the corresponding @xmath106 parameter quantities .",
    "although such measurements are not yet within the capabilities of experiment , we believe that a strong case can be made for the development of single molecule detectors with spectral resolution .",
    "it is clear from our model calculations that emission spectroscopy provides a different and ( when combined with absorption spectroscopy ) more revealing signature of chromophore dynamics than obtainable from absorption alone .",
    "this is not surprising , but the present study is ( to our knowledge ) the first to demonstrate this fact explicitly . as we have repeatedly stated , the present scheme for emission spectroscopy is sensitive only to molecular transitions and not directly to emission frequency .",
    "emission frequency is assumed to be on resonance with specific transitions .",
    "while this approach works well in the limit of weak coupling to the environment , stronger coupling invariably leads to level shifts , motional narrowing as associated complications .",
    "a general and practical formulation of true emission photon counting statistics has yet to be developed .",
