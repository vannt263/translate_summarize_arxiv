    "as is suggested by a wide variety of observational evidences , many astrophysical objects can be modeled as axially symmetric bodies with prolate or oblate deformation .",
    "for example , it is known that the earth has non vanishing quadrupolar and octupolar moments , as a consequence of its oblate shape@xcite .",
    "also , many galaxies with a large disc component can be assumed as axisymmetric oblate bodies with a large quadrupolar moment and , in some cases , with a comparable octupolar deformation due to the remaining components ( for example , the halo ) . likewise , there are galaxy clusters with a cigarlike shape@xcite and many dwarf galaxies that can be considered as nearly axisymmetric prolate deformed objects@xcite .",
    "although in the above cases the quadrupolar moment it is considered to be the major deviation from the spherical symmetry , there are situations ( for example , some metallic clusters ) where the octupolar deformation play a significant role@xcite .    the motion of test particles around such stellar objects is a problem of wide physical interest .",
    "the case of attraction centers described by monopolar plus quadrupolar terms has been extensively studied by guern and letelier , from a classical and relativistic standpoint , showing that the inclusion of external multipolar moments can induce chaos@xcite . in newtonian gravity , as well as in general relativity",
    ", chaos can be found when the source has prolate deformation and the chaoticity grows by increasing the quadrupolar moment . on the other hand",
    ", it seems to be that the case corresponding to oblate deformation does not lead to chaotic motion , indeed for a very large quadrupolar deformation .",
    "however , inclusion of octupolar deformation can also induce chaos , as it was shown by heiss , nasmitdinov and radu@xcite and li@xcite in the case of an harmonic oscillator .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the motion of test particles in axially symmetric gravitational potentials that are the sum of a monopole , a quadrupole and an octupolar term ( only external multipole moments will be considered ) . at the first instance , in sec .",
    "[ newton ] , we shall perform the analysis in the context of newtonian gravity by examining how the structure of the poincar surfaces of section is determined by the octupolar moment .",
    "we find that , even in the case of oblate deformation , modest values of the octupolar moment induce chaotic motion .",
    "then , in order to compare how these results are modified by considering the first general relativistic corrections , we shall introduce in sec .",
    "[ 1pn ] the post newtonian ( 1pn ) approach , where the gravity is described by the classical newtonian potential and another additional field , which is written in terms of the 1pn multipolar moments .",
    "contrary to the usual statement that integrable problems in newtonian theory become non integrable in general relativity , we find that , for certain values of the 1pn multipolar moments , the test particle motion is regular in situations where the newtonian theory predicts chaos .",
    "consider a test particle moving in the axially symmetric gravitational field generated by a stellar body with quadrupolar and octupolar deformation .",
    "in cylindrical coordinates @xmath0 , its potential has the form @xmath1 since we are interested on to describe the exterior test particle motion , we consider only external multipolar moments . in the above equation @xmath2",
    "is the monopole term that equals to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the total mass of the source and @xmath5 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the quadrupolar term , denoted by @xmath6 , usually represents the major deviation from spherical symmetry .",
    "in particular , if @xmath7 the source has prolate deformation and if @xmath8 we have the case corresponding to oblate deformation .",
    "the octupolar moment @xmath9 describes the asymmetry of the source with respect to the equatorial plane , i.e. its `` shape - of - pear '' deformation .",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath9 are related to the source s density @xmath10 through the equations @xcite @xmath11 where we have used spherical coordinates @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes the legendre polinomial of order @xmath15 .",
    "the motion of a test particle in a gravitational field described by ( [ multipolarnewton ] ) , obeys the relations @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the effective potential , given by @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is the axial specific angular momentum that is conserved as a consequence of the axial symmetry .",
    "the second integral of motion is the total specific energy , given by @xmath20 according to eqs .",
    "( [ em1])-([enrgynewton ] ) , the motion is restricted to a three dimensional phase space @xmath21 .",
    "this fact enable us to introduce the poincar surfaces of section method , in order to investigate the trajectories of test particles .    in fig .",
    "[ quadrupolar1 ] we plot a typical @xmath22 surface of section corresponding to test particle motion in the presence of a gravitational field due to a prolate deformed source whom octupolar moment vanishes ( from here on , we choose @xmath23 , without loss of generality ) .",
    "we note a central and lateral regular regions composed by ring torus ( ring kam curves ) .",
    "they are enclosed by a chaotic region containing two small resonant islands near its top and bottom edges . in fig .",
    "[ octopolar1a ] we switch on the octupolar moment @xmath24 , maintaining the same prolate deformation .",
    "the resulting surface of section presents a more prominent chaotic region , since in this case the outer zones of resonant islands have overlapped .",
    "the regular regions now contains `` spindle '' torus .",
    "they can be viewed clearly in the central region and scarcely insinuated in the lateral zone . in fig .",
    "[ octopolar1b ] , as a consequence of increase the octupolar moment to @xmath25 , the chaotic region is more prominent ( the lateral regular zone has disappeared ) , as well as the central spindle kam curves . finally , figs .",
    "[ octupolar2 ] and [ meridionaloctupolar2 ] show the effect caused by the progressive rise in the octupolar deformation , starting from a regular prolate situation .",
    "the fact that by switching on the octupolar moment increases the chaoticity and leads to apparition of spindle torus , can be viewed even in the case corresponding to oblate deformation , which commonly presents regular motion ( in fact , there is a wide numerical evidence that particles moving around a monopole plus an oblate quadrupole are not chaotic ) . fig .",
    "[ octupolar3 ] shows the transition from regularity to chaos by increasing @xmath9 . with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we start from @xmath29 ( fig .",

    "we are interested in the situation when a test particle moves around a static axially symmetric source . as it was shown by rezania and sobouti @xcite , in the stationary case we have an integral of motion @xmath36 that can be considered as a generalization of the classical specific energy . here",

    "( [ em3 ] ) , ( [ em4 ] ) and ( [ uef ] ) , along with ( [ multipolarnewton ] ) and ( [ multipolar1pn ] ) , we can study the trajectories of test particles in a similar way than in the newtonian case , as was performed in section [ newton ] .",

    "it has similar features as in fig .",
    "[ octopolar1b ] , but in this case there is not lateral resonant islands . if one increase adequately the post newtonian quadrupole and octupole , an interesting fact occurs : the chaotic zones disappear and the resulting surface of section reveals completely regular motion . indeed , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ octopolar1pnb ] , the regular regions are made by rings instead of spindle torus , for these particular values of multipole parameters . in figure [ contornos1pnocto ]",
    "we show the contours of the effective potential corresponding to these two cases .",
    "the former exhibits @xmath22 asymmetry while the second is practically symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane .",
    "octupolar deformation in astrophysical objects can introduce significant modifications to the phase - space structure corresponding to test particles moving around prolate or oblate centers of attraction . apart from an increasing in the chaoticity ,",
    "the apparition of spindle torus in regular regions is a remarkable effect caused by the asymmetry of the source with respect to its equatorial plane .",
    "a larger equatorial asymmetry involves more distorted spindle kam curves and more prominent stochastic regions in the phase - space .",
    "this fact carries dramatic consequences in the case of oblate deformed sources , which usually are associated with regular motion .",
    "here , chaos emerges once we switch on the octupole moment .",
    "when the first general relativistic corrections are taken into account , through the post newtonian approach , the structure in the phase space remains practically the same as in newtonian gravity , for typical values of 1pn multipolar moments .",
    "however , there are certain large values for which the test particle motion becomes regular .",
