    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are binary stars consisting of a white dwarf ( wd ) and a late spectral type secondary which fills , or almost fills , its roche lobe and transfers mass to the wd .",
    "cvs divide into a number of subclasses @xcite and the object of our study , mv lyrae , is a novalike cv of the vy scl subclass .",
    "a defining characteristic of this subclass is a non - periodic alternation between high and low luminosity states , differentiated by a change in mean brightness of more than one magnitude between states .",
    "this alternation usually takes place on intervals of hundreds of days .",
    "the orbital period of mv lyr , @xmath2 , places it close to the long - period end of the period gap @xcite .",
    "its high - low range is 12.2 - 18 , inferred from fig.4 of @xcite .",
    "while it is widely argued that evolution of cvs with periods longer than the period gap is controlled by magnetic braking @xcite , and evolution shortward of the gap is driven by gravitational radiation @xcite , this scenario has been recently challenged by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "patterson ( 1984 ) developed an empirical mass transfer relationship for cvs which predicts a mass transfer rate of @xmath3 at the orbital period of mv lyr .",
    "a theory of magnetic braking @xcite shows that the mass transfer rate from the secondary is a decreasing function with decreasing orbital period , reaching a value of @xmath4 at the top of the period gap , where mv lyr is found , for the parameters used in their study .",
    "some authors , as discussed below , adopt even larger mass transfer rates at the top of the period gap .    if the magnetic braking mechanism that drives evolution of the secondary star is suddenly turned off at an orbital period of @xmath5 , then the secondary approaches thermal equilibrium on a kelvin - helmholtz timescale .",
    "consequently , mass transfer continues at a decreasing rate for @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "but the alternation between high and low states in vy scl stars is on a much shorter timescale and requires a separate mechanism to switch the mass transfer on and off .",
    "@xcite discuss the problem and propose starspots on the secondary star , which pass across the l1 point and cause reduced mass transfer .",
    "this proposal has been further developed @xcite with application of a time - dependent code to model the variable accretion disk .",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "but the @xcite model produced the unwanted result of dwarf - nova type outbursts in the low state , after mass transfer had been switched off .",
    "a suggested escape was maintenance of the inner accretion disk in a permanent high state through irradiation by the wd ( leach et al .",
    "1999 , hereafter l1999 ) .",
    "l1999 concluded that the presence of a 40,000k wd does suppress dwarf nova outbursts .",
    "the l1999 study adopted a high state mass transfer rate of @xmath7 that was chosen to guarantee that hydrogen is fully ionized at the outer accretion disk boundary . according to l1999",
    ", cessation of mass transfer produces a rapid transition to a state of low but non - zero viscosity .",
    "the accretion disk remains nearly intact during the low state , transferring only a few percent of the accretion disk mass to the wd . because of non - zero viscosity",
    ", the accretion disk still radiates at a low level during the low state .",
    "hameury & lasota ( 2002 , hereafter hl02 ) show that the adopted wd mass in l1999 ( 0.4@xmath8 ) is important to the suppression of outbursts , and that a wd mass of 0.7@xmath8 would have produced outbursts .",
    "hl02 alternatively propose that vy scl stars have magnetic wds and that the magnetic field truncates the accretion disk .",
    "hl02 show that , for a wd mass of 0.7@xmath8 and a magnetic moment of @xmath9 , no outbursts occur and the change in the @xmath10 magnitude , from high state to low state , is 5 magnitudes .",

    "( 2004 , hereafter h2004 ) used the binsyn suite @xcite to calculate a system model and corresponding synthetic spectrum for mv lyr in a recent low state .",
    "the synthetic spectrum accurately fits _ fuse _ spectra and contemporaneous optical spectra , as well as _ iue _",
    "spectra from a prior low state .",
    "the h2004 discussion considers the connection of the low state study to earlier investigations of mv lyr and shows that the low state can be understood in terms of a naked hot wd with a temperature of 47,000k , a photosphere log @xmath11 of 8.25 , and a metallicity of 0.3 solar .",
    "the log @xmath11 , together with the mass - radius relation for zero - temperature carbon wd models @xcite selects a model with @xmath12 , estimated error of @xmath13 , and radius of @xmath14 .",
    "the secondary star fills its roche lobe and is cooler than 3500k ; it contributes nothing to the fuv flux and a varying amount to the optical flux , from 10% at 5200  to 60% at 7800 .",
    "if an accretion disk is present it contributes negligibly to the observed spectra . assuming no disk is present , the model optical light curve , for a system orbital inclination of @xmath15 taken from the literature , has an amplitude approximately 50% larger that of the observed optical light curve .",

    "program modules assign @xmath1 values to individual stellar points based on adopted polar @xmath1 values , bolometric albedos , and gravity darkening exponents .",
    "model stars may rotate synchronously or non - synchronously up to critical rotation .",
    "program modules calculate log @xmath11 values at stellar photosphere points based on adopted roche potentials and stellar masses , while other modules determine whether a given point is visible to the observer , for a point on a star , the accretion disk face or the accretion disk rim , and for the current values of orbital inclination and orbital longitude .",
    "calculation of a synthetic spectrum uses a set of precalculated source synthetic spectra for each system object ( stars , accretion disk face , accretion disk rim ) .",
    "the source spectra for a given object typically form a two - dimensional set in @xmath1 and log @xmath11 that encompasses the extreme @xmath1 and log @xmath11 values on the photosphere of the given object .",

    "assigns @xmath1 values to annuli based on the standard model , appropriate to an assumed mass transfer rate .",
    "an option permits modification of the assigned annulus @xmath1 values to include calculated irradiation by the wd , based on a bolometric albedo formalism .",
    "calculation of a synthetic spectrum for the accretion disk , as part of the calculation of the system synthetic spectrum , involves interpolation among previously calculated source spectra ( with their individual @xmath1 values ) to produce a synthetic spectrum for each annulus , for its @xmath1 as assigned by binsyn .",
    "the accretion disk source spectra may consist largely of synthetic spectra for annulus models produced by tlusty @xcite .",
    "this calculation is followed by integration over all annuli , with detailed allowance for doppler shifts and sources of line broadening , and with proper allowance for visibility to the observer .",
    "the number of source spectra typically will differ from the specified number of annuli .",

    "in fitting the optical spectra , h2004 found two difficulties : ( 1 ) the polar @xmath1 of the secondary was cooler than 3500k , which is the temperature of the coolest ( kurucz ) model atmosphere available to us .",

    "these residuals apply to the scaled spectra .",
    "an important conclusion from the fig .",
    "1 fit is that there is no evidence for the presence of an accretion disk . in a test of the sensitivity of the fit to added flux from a putative accretion disk , we find empirically that addition of 0.005 flux units ( fig .  1 ordinates ) produces a visually detectable displacement of the summed spectrum from the fig .  1 fit . at 3000",
    ", the secondary star makes a calculated contribution of 0.1% to the system flux .",
    "h2004 fit an optical ( unfiltered ) light curve of mv lyr ( their fig .",

    "it assumes an orbital inclination for the cv of @xmath30 from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter spt95 ) .",
    "however , the corresponding amplitude of the model light curve is 50% too large . the orbital period light variation results from the variable presentation of the irradiated secondary component to the observer .",
    "as the assumed inclination decreases from @xmath30 , the light amplitude decreases monotonically .",
    "an improved fit @xcite implies a system inclination of @xmath31 , which we adopt for this analysis .",
    "a remark is in order on the absolute accuracy of the results obtained in this paper .",
    "a key step is in the determination of the wd mass and radius in units of the solar values by comparison between the mv lyr wd log @xmath11 from our analysis of the fuse spectrum and the log @xmath11 values for the @xcite carbon wd models .",
    "the mass ratio , @xmath32 , comes from relatively uncertain radial velocity measurements ( spt95 ) , and this value determines the mass of the secondary star and , since the secondary fills its roche lobe , the size of the secondary star .",
    "the fit of our synthetic spectra to fuv data , in all cases , applies a scaling divisor , @xmath28 , to observed spectra which were divided by @xmath29 ( see the ordinate labels )",
    ". the scaling divisor may be inaccurate by 10% to 15% .",

    "binsyn interpolated among seven nextgen synthetic spectra with @xmath1 values between 2600k and 5400k to determine flux values for individual secondary star photospheric segments .",
    "the fit of the system synthetic spectrum to the optical spectra is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the optical spectra were multiplied by an empirically determined factor of 2 to correct for obscuration by clouds .",
    "recapitulating , we have developed a model for the low state of mv lyr consisting of a 47,000k wd and a secondary star with a polar @xmath1 of 2600k .",
    "the secondary star fills its roche lobe and is irradiated by the wd .",
    "the model has no accretion disk , and differs from the model in h2004 only in the improved representation of the secondary star in the calculated synthetic spectra .",
    "this model produces an excellent fit to the fuse data , the low state _ iue _",
    "data , and the optical data .",
    "we proceed to compare our model to the low state predictions of l1999 and hl02 .",
    "l1999 ( their fig .  3 ) predict an accretion disk luminosity in the low state of @xmath35 .",
    "3 plots the residual of the l1999 accretion disk ( asterisk ) , for the 505pc ( h2004 ) distance of mv lyr .",
    "the residual is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 = 505pc .",
    "the l1999 accretion disk flux at 5500  would have to be approximately 60 times fainter to accord with the residual plot .",
    "we calculated a synthetic spectrum for the example in hl02 , with @xmath38 , with @xmath39 and mass ratio @xmath40 .",
    "the calculated inner radius for the hl02 example ( equation 4 ) is @xmath41 cm and the mv lyr wd radius is @xmath42 cm .",
    "consequently we set the inner accretion disk radius equal to the wd radius , the outer radius equal to the tidal truncation radius , and the mass transfer rate equal to @xmath43 ( hl02 value ) .",
    "we used the synthetic spectrum of the calculated accretion disk alone in the following comparison .",
    "we divided the output flux in the synthetic spectrum by 100.0 , the factor by which the hl02 model luminosity drops between the high and low states , to provide the hl02 model flux to compare with our low state data .",
    "as with l1999 , this calculated low state luminosity is a residual , [ ( system model)-(binsyn low state model ) ] , shown in fig .  3 by a diamond .",
    "it could be argued that division by 100.0 for all wavelengths is too simplistic in transforming the hl02 model to an equivalent low state , particularly since we have no observational data in the 5000  to 6000  interval .",
    "our fig .",
    "2 shows that the low state synthetic spectrum varies smoothly over this wavelength interval , as does our intermediate state model and high state model , discussed in the following sections ( not shown in separate figures ) .",
    "thus , we believe the division by 100.0 is appropriate .",
    "the hl02 flux needs to be smaller by approximately a factor 5 - 10 to agree with the spectral residuals .",
    "thus , we find a discrepancy between the predictions of both l1999 and hl02 for the mv lyr low state and our fit to available low state data",
    ".    how cool would an mv lyr accretion disk have to be , in the low state , to avoid detection in optical spectra ?",
    "tests with an isothermal accretion disk , represented by a black body and truncated at @xmath44 ( see the following text for a discussion of the truncation radius ) , demonstrate that an accretion disk must have a @xmath1 less than 2500k to avoid a conflict with our optical spectra ( a 2500k accretion disk would provide a detectable 3% of the system flux at 7800 ) . a study of tt ari @xcite obtained comparable results .",
    "a possible accretion disk would need to be truncated at @xmath45 and have a @xmath1 less than 3000k to satisfy the low state optical spectra .",
    "the _ iue _ archives include 10 spectra of mv lyr .",
    "none of these were obtained during a high state , and two , swp07296 and lwr06288 , were obtained on dec . 2 , 1979 during an intermediate state .",

    "spectra is their much lower ( i.e. , less blue ) spectral gradient than the low state _",
    "this is surely due to the presence of an optically thick accretion disk .",
    "we calculated a series of annulus models , using tlusty version 200 @xcite for individual mass transfer rates of @xmath4 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "these latter models were spaced in values of @xmath48 between 2.5 and an outer value of @xmath49 , @xmath1=10,620k .",
    "tlusty includes a large number of optional control flags that control the program performance .",
    "we preserved the default control flags , and thereby produced lte thin disk models with thin photospheres .",
    "convergence problems intervened for larger values of @xmath48 .",
    "we used a viscosity parameter @xmath50 @xcite for all models .",
    "the models included opacity contributions from the 30 most abundant periodic table elements .",
    "we used these models to calculate source ( see above ) synthetic spectra , via synspec version 48 @xcite , for all models , with the same opacities used for the model calculations .",
    "we included synthetic spectra for kurucz stellar model atmospheres , calculated with synspec , to handle assigned temperatures cooler than the 10,897k limit described above .",
    "comparison among the annulus source synthetic spectra for the different tabular mass transfer rates showed that spectra for different mass transfer rates but similar @xmath1 values are essentially identical .",
    "consequently , it is permissible to fix the source synthetic spectra of the annuli at some specific tabular mass transfer rate , but change the binsyn mass transfer rate for a new simulation , and still produce a valid system synthetic spectrum .",
    "the accuracy of the accretion disk synthetic spectrum is sensitive to the @xmath1 spacing of the source synthetic spectra .",
    "linear interpolation between source spectra differing in @xmath1 values by several thousand kelvins can produce an inaccurate interpolated spectrum .",
    "after extensive experiment , we adopted a `` universal '' set of 69 source spectra , of which 62 were tlusty models .",
    "these latter models had @xmath1 values spaced at roughly 500k intervals between 10,620k and 31,564k and a slightly larger step between 31,564k and 63,735k .",

    "contributions from @xmath51 or cooler @xmath1 values are very small or negligible .",
    "our initial study of the intermediate state adopted a variety of assumed mass transfer rates , together with a standard model accretion disk .",

    "all the lines are in absorption ( fig .  7 , discussed below ) ,",
    "consistent with an optically thick disk .",
    "we investigated whether a standard model synthetic spectrum , including the option of a truncated accretion disk , can fit the hst spectrum .",
    "we began with the l1999 mass transfer rate of @xmath7 and no truncation and found that the predicted flux for this model is appreciably too large at all hst wavelengths .",
    "the same mass transfer rate and an accretion disk truncated at @xmath91 leads to a synthetic spectrum that is too blue and a slightly too small flux level , and an accretion disk truncated at @xmath92 produces a synthetic spectrum that is too blue and a slightly too large flux level . successively smaller mass transfer rates and no disk truncation produced models with flux levels still too large but with a smaller mean residual . at each mass transfer rate it was possible to find a pair of truncation radii for which the corresponding synthetic spectra bracketed the hst spectrum , one with slightly too large flux values , the other too small ; in each case , both bracketing spectra were too blue .",
    "in addition to the initial test , we tested mass transfer rates of @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath46 , and finally @xmath96 . in this latter case",
    "an accretion disk extending to the wd surface fits the hst spectrum well between 1150  and 1200 , but is much too blue ( too little flux ) longward of 1200 .",
    "smaller mass transfer rates produce synthetic spectra with too small flux at all hst wavelengths .",
    "we conclude that standard model synthetic spectra , with or without truncated accretion disks , do not fit the hst spectrum ; they are too blue .    with the objective to flatten the theoretical spectral gradient , we selected the standard model with small errors at the short wavelength extreme , mass transfer rate of @xmath96 , and modified the @xmath0 relation to an isothermal outer region with elevated temperature .",
    "we proceeded by initially selecting an accretion disk annulus at a large radius and setting the @xmath1 values of all annuli of larger radius to the @xmath1 of the selected annulus .",
    "the resulting synthetic spectrum provided an improved fit to the hst spectrum .",
    "we continued , gradually moving to a smaller crossover annulus and consequently higher @xmath1 value , until we reached a crossover annulus of @xmath97 and annuli @xmath98k at larger radii . at smaller radii",
    "the annulus @xmath1 values continued to follow a standard model for a mass transfer rate of @xmath96 .",
    "the spectral gradient now was about correct but the overall flux level had become somewhat too large , and so we reduced the flux level by truncating the accretion disk . because of the high @xmath1 value at the truncation radius , the color of the synthetic spectrum is mildly sensitive to the truncation radius value .",
    "we found an optimum fit with a truncation radius of @xmath99 and @xmath1 there of 43,404k .",
    "it is likely that a slightly modified mass transfer rate , together with slightly changed truncation radius and crossover radius and outer annulus @xmath1 value would fit the hst spectrum equally well .",
    "for that reason , we do not attribute special significance to the fact that the truncation radius found here is the same as the truncation radius for the intermediate state .",
    "the large differences between the hst spectrum and the synthetic spectrum absorption lines lead to larger mean and mean absolute residuals than for the intermediate and low states .",
    "the mean residual of the fit to the 970 points between 1150  and 1715  was -0.44 and the mean absolute residual was 0.71 .",
    "these residuals apply to the scaled spectra .",
    "figures 710 show the fit to the hst spectrum of a synthetic spectrum with our optimum high state parameters .",
    "although the continuum is a reasonable fit , individual line fits show appreciable discrepancies , especially for the high excitation lines of nv , si iv , c iv , and he ii . since all of our synthetic spectra assume solar composition , the discrepancies could arise from : ( 1 ) abundance differences from solar composition , or ( 2 ) excitation differences between the formation regions for the absorption lines and the continuum .",
    "the observed absorption lines show a slight blue shift corresponding to a velocity of about @xmath100 .",

    "the velocity difference ( of @xmath102 ) is a clear indication that the absorption lines are formed in a wind .",
    "since mv lyr is viewed nearly pole - on , this means the wind has a low velocity .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the observed line broadenings as listed in table  2 , e.g. , the si iv doublet near 1400 .    fig .  8 shows the vicinity of ly @xmath103 .",
    "note the much better fit of the overplotted annulus synthetic spectrum ( @xmath104k ) to the observed ly @xmath103 line than is true for the system synthetic spectrum , whose mean @xmath1 is appreciably lower .",
    "this indicates that the absorption lines are formed in a higher temperature environment ( i.e. , corona or wind ) than is true for the continuum .",
    "9 shows the si iv doublet near 1400  ; it is too weak in the system synthetic spectrum , and equivalent widths for the overplotted annulus synthetic spectrum ( @xmath104k ) are again a better fit .",
    "the c iv doublet ( fig .",
    "10 ) in the system synthetic spectrum is also much too weak . the doublet is stronger in both the overplotted annulus synthetic spectra ( @xmath1=31,564k , and 38,076k ) , but not by enough when scaled to fit the observed profile .",
    "the c ii line complex ( fig .",
    "9 ) is slightly too weak in the overplotted annulus spectrum , while the equivalent width of the system synthetic spectrum appears comparable to the observed value .",
    "the c iii line complex , fig .  8 in the overplotted annulus synthetic spectrum , appears to have an equivalent width approximately matching the observed value , while the system synthetic spectrum is too weak .",
    "the varying strengths of c lines in different ionization stages and the observed ( large ) strength of n v ( fig .",
    "8) may be due to composition effects but we can not exclude the possibility that it is an excitation effect .",
    "large n v / c iv ratios have been seen in several cv systems @xcite and are likely related to evolutionary effects .",
    "note that h2004 determines an overall metal composition for the mv lyr wd of @xmath105 , but detailed elemental abundances , relative to solar values , of c=0.5 , n=0.5 , and si=0.2 .",
    "( since strong excitation effects are clearly present there is no conflict between our assumed solar abundance for the present analysis and the wd composition determination in h2004 . )",
    "it is of interest to compare the emission line spectrum of the intermediate state and the absorption line spectrum of the high state ( fig .",
    "note that emission lines in the intermediate state match corresponding absorption lines in the high state . as well as can be judged , the relative strengths of the various resonance emission lines are similar to the relative strengths of the same absorption lines . the hst spectrum in fig .",
    "11 has been displaced downward to superpose the c iv complex .",

    "comparable fits result when other spectral regions are superposed , although the low signal level of the _ iue _ spectrum produces some ambiguity .",

    "the isothermal accretion disk extending only half way to the tidal cutoff radius in the intermediate state has the attractive feature that it provides a ready explanation for emission lines ( the line emission region is seen extending beyond the edge of the accretion disk ) , while the same lines are seen in absorption in the high state ( the accretion disk now extends to the tidal cutoff radius ) .",

    "<S> archival _ iue _ spectra of the vy scl system mv lyr , taken during an intermediate state , can be best fit by an isothermal accretion disk extending half way to the tidal cutoff radius . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , a recent hst spectrum , while mv lyr was in a high state , can be best fit with a standard @xmath0 profile for an accretion disk extending from an inner truncation radius to an intermediate radius with an isothermal accretion disk beyond . </S>",
    "<S> these fits use component star parameters determined from a study of mv lyr in a low state . </S>",
    "<S> model systems containing accretion disks with standard @xmath0 profiles have continua that are too blue . </S>",
    "<S> the observed high state absorption line spectrum exhibits excitation higher than provided by the @xmath0 profile , indicating likely line formation in a high temperature region extending vertically above the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption lines show a blue shift and line broadening corresponding to formation in a low velocity wind apparently coextensive with the high temperature region . </S>",
    "<S> lines of n v , si iv , c iv , and he ii are anomalously strong relative to our synthetic spectra , indicating possible composition effects , but unmodeled excitation effects could also produce the anomalies .    </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of a low state of mv lyrae , considered in an earlier study and extended in this paper , sets a limit of 2500k for the @xmath1 of an accretion disk that may be present in the low state . </S>",
    "<S> this limit is in conflict with two recent models of the vy scl phenomenon . </S>"
