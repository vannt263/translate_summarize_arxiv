    "<S> self - assembled quantum dots ( qds ) can generate indistinguishable photons @xcite , entangled photon pairs @xcite , and entangled spins and photons @xcite due to the large oscillator strengths , clean selection rules , and relatively coherent spin states @xcite of trapped carriers in qds . </S>",
    "<S> to exploit these characteristics for linear - optical quantum computing @xcite or quantum repeaters and distributed quantum networks @xcite , three crucial requirements of scalable qd devices are ( i ) efficient collection of the spontaneous emission into a single optical mode , ( ii ) minimal inhomogeneous broadening to enable transform - limited linewidths , and ( iii ) spectral tunability so that each dot can be made indistinguishable  @xcite .    multiple approaches to enhance the extraction efficiency ( @xmath0 ) , defined here as the ratio of power collected by an objective lens to the total power emitted from a dipole , have been pursued . </S>",
    "<S> a common strategy is to create a highly directional far - field radiation pattern , which has been achieved for qds embedded in both high - q cavities @xcite and low - q planar cavity structures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , sub - wavelength dielectric nanowires have been shown @xcite to act as highly efficient waveguides with tailorable far - field radiation patterns @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unlike high - q cavities , these waveguides are compatible with large spectral tunability as the spontaneous emission is funnelled into the waveguide over a wide spectral range with high fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> hence , highly tunable and efficient quantum photonic devices can be envisioned with this platform .    </S>",
    "<S> reversible , _ in - situ _ manipulation of single particles in qds can best be achieved with electric @xcite and strain @xcite fields . </S>",
    "<S> successful electrical contacting of qds embedded in vertical nanowires @xcite has yet to be demonstrated due to the difficulty of fabricating reliable nanoscale metal - semiconductor contacts . </S>",
    "<S> _ in - situ _ strain tuning of nanowires also presents challenges not present for bulk structures , as significant strain - field relaxation along the length of the nanowire occurs in high - aspect - ratio structures . </S>",
    "<S> thus far , strain fields have been used to dynamically and quasi - permanently control  @xcite the electronic properties of qds in nanowire waveguides . however , to date , reversible _ in - situ _ tuning of two - level emitters in nanowire waveguides has not been realized .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to high @xmath0 and pure single - photon emission , a requirement of single - photon emitters for some applications is transform - limited linewidths ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , localized charges in the environment of the qd can shift a dot s emission energy via the quantum confined stark effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations in the microscopic charge distribution in the dot s environment can then lead to spectral fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of spectral fluctuations is determined by the ratio @xmath2 and the timescale of the charge fluctuation ; the spectroscopic manifestation of the fluctuations is also determined by the experimental acquisition time  @xcite . in semiconductors , </S>",
    "<S> fluctuating charges are omnipresent , particularly at defects formed at interfaces@xcite and free - surfaces@xcite . therefore , qds in small - diameter nanowires are particularly susceptible to significant spectral fluctuations  @xcite .        here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate an elastically - tunable qd embedded in a nanowire waveguide which emits single photons with linewidths limited by our experimental resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a deterministic top - down fabrication procedure to create nanowires with desired geometries . </S>",
    "<S> non - resonant photoluminescence ( pl ) spectroscopy of qds in these nanowires shows that the qd emission can be outcoupled with high fidelity , although with less - than - ideal success rates . </S>",

    "<S> the large variation in @xmath0 is ascribed to variations in the radial position of the qd as well as surface roughness and asymmetry in the nanowire structures . at low excitation powers , </S>",
    "<S> resolution - limited spectral linewidths are found for some qds . at higher excitation powers , </S>",
    "<S> dc stark shifts and inhomogeneous linewidth broadening are observed due to static and fluctuating electric fields ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively ) at the qd position , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we quantitatively estimate @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the qd position by assuming they are generated by filling of nearby nanowire surface states via above - band - gap excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution - limited linewidths at low excitation powers lead to optimism that resonant driving of the qds could be successfully achieved in future experiments for full quantum - optical control of the qd . </S>",
    "<S> such experiments are greatly assisted by _ in - situ _ tuning of the qd excitonic transition energy  @xcite , which we demonstrate here for the first time with nanowire qds via bonding to a piezoelectric crystal . </S>",

    "<S> the non - resonant laser excites carriers above the gaas band - gap that can relax into the qd as well as fill defect surface states ; increasing the excitation power ( @xmath50 ) increases the number of carriers at the nanowire surface . </S>",

    "<S> the fits agree well with the data and @xmath5 is linearly proportional to @xmath62 for each qd . </S>",
    "<S> further , we can estimate the fluctuating electric field , @xmath6 , by assuming the fluctuation ( @xmath63 ) in the number of electrons ( @xmath64 ) located at the surface is proportional to the electronic shot noise : @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate @xmath64 by assuming electrons a distance @xmath14/2 create @xmath5 , and then use @xmath6 to find the corresponding @xmath66 from the stark equation . for dot a , the estimated power broadening of @xmath53 ( shown as the labeled _ surface - charge fit _ in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) ) fits the experimental data very well above the system s resolution limit . </S>",
    "<S> the surface - charge fit also enables us to estimate the power broadening below the resolution limit . </S>",
    "<S> both the data and the extrapolated fit suggest the inhomogeneous broadening is dominated by the charges generated by the excitation laser at the nanowire surface . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig4:figure4 ] ( a ) shows several examples of exciton detuning for qds in different nanowire antennas as a function of applied bias to the piezoelectric crystal ( @xmath67 ) . we observe varied strain - tuning slopes for each qd in each nanowire , as summarised for 30 qds in the histogram in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> in general , the strain tuning is achieved with small amounts of hysteresis , as shown for . </S>",
    "<S> a maximum tuning amplitude of @xmath68mev was achieved in the experiment . the large standard deviation in tuning </S>",
    "<S> is expected for two reasons : ( i ) the amplitude and even sign of the strain field is highly dependent on the radial position of the qd in the nanowire ( as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3dsketch ] ) ; and ( ii ) strain tuning of the quantum states is highly dependent on the exact morphology of the dot , which is unique for every qd  @xcite . in spite of the significant strain - field relaxation in the au contact and the nanowire </S>",
    "<S> , we achieve substantial _ in - situ _ strain tuning of the qd excitonic transition energies . </S>",
    "<S> further improvement in the tuning range can be obtained by reducing the au layer thickness @xmath15 and moving the qd closer to the mirror , which may however lead to more spectral fluctuations .    in conclusion </S>",
