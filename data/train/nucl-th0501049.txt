    "in qcd , charge symmetry ( cs ) is a symmetry of the lagrangian under the exchange of the up and down quarks  @xcite .",
    "this symmetry has many consequences at the hadronic level , where it translates into , , the invariance of the strong nuclear force under the exchange of protons and neutrons .",
    "however , cs is broken by the different masses of the up and down quarks and thus the strong interaction manifests charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) .",
    "the different electromagnetic properties of the up and down quarks also contribute to csb . an important consequence of the first csb effect ( strong csb ) is that the neutron is heavier than the proton , since if csb was only an electromagnetic effect the proton would be heavier and prone to decay .",
    "this would make our world very different , since big - bang nucleosynthesis is dependent on the relative proton and neutron abundances .    while there are a number of pieces of experimental evidences for csb  @xcite  including recent results in @xmath9 at iucf  @xcite and @xmath10 at triumf  @xcite  one of the most fundamental to nuclear physics is the difference between the neutron - neutron ( @xmath1 ) and proton - proton ( @xmath11 ) scattering lengths .",
    "the scattering lengths parameterize the nucleon - nucleon interaction at low relative energies through the effective range expansion . in this low - energy region",
    "the ( @xmath12 ) phase shift @xmath13 can be expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the center - of - momentum ( c.m . )",
    "relative nucleon momentum and @xmath16 the effective range .",
    "this expansion is reliable for @xmath17  mev/@xmath18 .    since there are no free neutron targets it is very difficult to make a direct measurement of the @xmath12 neutron - neutron scattering length , though proposals to do so have been made .",
    "the latest of these suggests using the pulsed nuclear reactor yaguar in snezhinsk , russia  @xcite .",
    "however , the more common  and so far more successful ",
    "approach is to rely on suitable reactions involving two free neutrons and corresponding theoretical calculations to extract @xmath1 from indirect data . by choosing the kinematics",
    "carefully one can detect the neutrons in a low - energy relative @xmath19-wave which can be accurately described by the effective range expansion ( [ eq : er ] ) .",
    "the currently accepted value @xmath20 is deduced from the break - up reaction @xmath21 and the pion radiative capture process @xmath0 .",
    "the first reaction is , however , complicated by the possible presence of three - body forces , but even after they are taken into account there are significant disagreements between values extracted by the two techniques .",

    "@xcite is also in disagreement with another @xmath22 experiment that claims @xmath24  fm  @xcite .",
    "earlier data had an even larger spread , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review . since the proton - proton scattering length is @xmath25  fm ( after corrections of electromagnetic effects  fm ) to @xmath1  @xcite , which for the rest of this paper will be ignored . ] ) , there is even uncertainty about the sign of the difference @xmath26 .",
    "the more negative @xmath1 is favored by nuclear structure calculations , where the small ( but important ) csb piece of the av18 potential is fitted to reproduce @xmath27 with @xmath28  fm  @xcite .",
    "the binding - energy difference between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which has a small contribution from csb effects , is then very accurately reproduced .",
    "this would not occur were @xmath27 to take the opposite sign  @xcite .    because of these issues the accepted value is weighted toward the @xmath31  fm reported by the most recent @xmath0 experiment  @xcite .",
    "the extraction in this is case done by fitting the shape of the neutron time - of - flight spectrum using the model of gibbs , gibson , and stephenson ( ggs )  @xcite .",
    "this model was developed in the mid-70s and explored many of the relevant mechanisms and the dependence on various choices of wave functions .",
    "gibbs , gibson , and stephenson calculated the single - nucleon radiative pion capture tree - level amplitude to order @xmath32 , and consequently ignored the pion loops that would enter at the next chiral order .",
    "two - body diagrams were not fully implemented in this model .",
    "the theoretical error was dominated by uncertainties in the scattering wave function .",
    "similar results were obtained in earlier @xmath0 experiments carried out at the paul scherrer institut ( psi ) ( then swiss institute of nuclear research )  @xcite . in the psi experiments ,",
    "only the fsi peak was fitted , while at lampf the entire spectrum was fitted . the theoretical work for the psi results compared the ggs model with work done by de  tramond and collaborators",
    "the latter used a dispersion relation approach for the final state interaction , with a theoretical error of the order 0.3  fm , , similar to ggs .    in this paper",
    "we recalculate the @xmath0 reaction using chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath33pt ) .",
    "the one - body and two - body mechanisms are thus consistent and the constraints of chiral symmetry are respected , which is of crucial importance in this threshold regime . at third order , @xmath2 , all the amplitudes of the previous calculation are included , as well as pion loops and three pion - rescattering diagrams .",
    "additional advantages of the chiral power counting are that it gives a clearly defined procedure to estimate the theoretical error and provides a systematic and consistent way to improve the calculation if needed . in this first paper",
    "we establish the machinery necessary for a precise extraction of the @xmath7 scattering length .",
    "we isolate the sources of the largest remaining errors and suggest means for their reduction , which should make it possible to reach the desired high precision in future work .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "@xcite then the @xmath250 of approximately 0.43 fm we have found here should be included in the theoretical uncertainty quoted in that work .",
    "however , correspondence with one of the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that fsi in @xmath165 @xmath153-waves was included in the version of the ggs model used for the @xmath1 extraction there  @xcite .",
    "this source of uncertainty would then not be present in ref .",
    "@xcite s value for @xmath1 .",
    "an estimate of a change in @xmath16 due to csb can be obtained by assuming that the relative change in @xmath16 is similar to the relative change in @xmath265 .",
    "thus @xmath266 so that @xmath267  fm .",
    "the sensitivity to the effective - range parameter @xmath16 was tested by varying it away from its nominal value @xmath268  fm , using a conservative spread of @xmath269  fm .",
    "this changes the fsi peak by @xmath270 ( after rescaling to the qf peak ) and thus indicates a change in the extracted @xmath1 of 1.2% or 0.21  fm . on the other hand ,",
    "the error suggested by analysis of different experimental determinations of @xmath16 is @xmath271  fm  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath16 is instead varied over this narrower range the resultant @xmath272 is only 0.5% or 0.09  fm .",
    "we will use the latter , smaller , error in our error budget .",
    "the errors are summarized in table  [ tab : errors ] .",
    "rdd source & & + off - shell & 0.07 & 0.01 + boost & < 0.11 & < 0.02 + subthreshold & 0.95 & 0.17 + @xmath219 2b & 0.7 & 0.12 + @xmath16 & 0.5 & 0.09 + dep .  on @xmath184 & 0.55 & 0.10 + @xmath15-wave in fsi & < 2.4 & < 0.43 + dep .  on @xmath187 & < 3.3 & < 0.60 + total & < 4.3 & < 0.78    [ table : errors ]    the first four errors are due to uncertainties in the amplitudes , while the last four are due to the wave functions  .",
    "we consider the total error of @xmath273 to be a very conservative estimate .",
    "note that if @xmath1 is extracted only from data in the fsi region then the last two errors drop to 0.2% and 0.5% respectively , while a number of the other errors listed in table  [ table : errors ] are also reduced .",
    "we find that an extraction performed using only data from this section of the neutron time - of - flight spectrum would have a theoretical uncertainty of @xmath6 fm .",
    "this confirms the conclusion of ggs from thirty years ago .",
    "the significantly reduced theoretical uncertainty comes at a price though : one must sacrifice the large number of counts acquired under the qf peak .",
    "we have argued above that the last two errors quoted in table  [ table : errors ] can be decreased by additional theoretical work on radiative pion - capture on deuterium , and therefore we hold out hope that in future a @xmath33eft extraction of @xmath1 which has an accuracy of @xmath274  fm ( or better ) and uses the full neutron spectrum obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite can be performed .",
    "one reason for this optimism is the convergence of the chiral expansion for this reaction , which can be made more explicit by computing the qf to fsi peak ratio for the different orders . from fig .",
    "[ fig : kr ] we obtain @xmath275 where the first parenthesis contains ( in order ) the contribution of the lo , nlo , nnlo , and the error in the chiral expansion .",
    "the second parenthesis shows the error due to effects in the wave functions .",
    "note that modifying the wave functions by including two - pion exchanges , @xmath153-waves , or different short - distance dynamics would already change the lo calculation , which is why we choose to write this error as an overall factor .",
    "the smallness of the nlo and nnlo one - body terms can perhaps be an effect of the particular kinematics of the present problem , especially that the pion momentum is vanishing .",
    "on the other hand , the comparatively large nnlo two - body contribution is most likely a result of a combination of two effects : firstly , the two - body currents allow for momentum sharing between the nucleons , which would be of importance in the qf region . secondly , in the leading two - body diagram [ fig .",
    "[ fig : two](a ) ] , the coulombic propagator was power - counted as @xmath276 . however , because of the small deuteron binding energy , the typical momentum is instead of the order @xmath277  mev  @xcite . since @xmath278 this further enhances this diagram .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the @xmath0 reaction , using @xmath33pt pion - photon amplitudes and eft - inspired wave functions .",
    "the errors in the extracted scattering length from the operators are of the order 1% .",
    "these errors include effects that were not considered by gibbs , gibson , and stephenson ( ggs )  @xcite , , errors from extrapolating the single - nucleon amplitudes sub - threshold , the boost of the @xmath49 amplitude from the @xmath142 rest frame to c.m . , the effects of off - shell nucleons , and more complicated two - body mechanisms .",
    "a key improvement is that we have included the full two - body amplitude at third chiral order and have found that on the scale of the other errors it has a substantial influence on the extraction of the scattering length .",
    "nevertheless , if @xmath1 is extracted from the fsi region alone our analysis within @xmath33eft confirms ggs s result for the theoretical uncertainties , putting them at @xmath6 fm . on the other hand ,",
    "if  as was done in the most recent @xmath1 extraction  @xcite  the entire shape of the neutron spectrum , including both the qf and fsi peaks , is used for the extraction , then the uncertainty in the scattering wave function at small distances and the neglect of higher partial waves is a potentially large source of errors , maybe as large as 4.3% .",
    "this might seem like a large uncertainty , since it is almost three times larger than the 1.5% estimated by ggs .",
    "but , as was argued in sec .",
    "[ sec : errorwf ] , some of the assumptions behind their error estimate do not seem to apply for the entire kinematic range spanned by the data from the lampf experiment . this tempts us to suggest that the error estimate given in ref .",
    "@xcite is optimistic and should be increased .",
    "we plan to improve our model in the near future by constraining the short - distance part of the @xmath7 wave function using other observables and by incorporating higher partial waves .",
    "we will report these results in a future publication .",
    "we also plan to fold our model with the neutron detector acceptance and the experimental geometry in order to extract the @xmath7 scattering length from the data of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "overall we conclude that the @xmath0 reaction has some very desirable features that makes it extremely suitable for the extraction of the neutron - neutron scattering length .",
    "the vanishing pion momentum obviously favors a @xmath33pt calculation and also reduces the number of contributing terms dramatically , leading to the dominance of the kroll - ruderman term .",
    "the fact that the extraction is done by fitting the shape of time - of - flight spectra rather than an absolute decay rate reduces many errors further still .",
    "the reaction @xmath279 could be used as an alternative and complementary way to extract the neutron - neutron scattering length .",
    "this reaction has been considered before , see the review @xcite and later papers , , @xcite .",
    "a chiral calculation should be feasible for this reaction , and could benefit from the work of the present paper . with a threshold photon laboratory energy of @xmath280  mev it should be accessible at existing experimental facilities , , hi@xmath281s@tunl after the planned upgrade and max - lab in lund , sweden . after the submission of the manuscript ,",
    "a calculation of @xmath279 using chiral perturbation theory along lines similar to ours has become available  @xcite .",
