    "accretion disks are formed when matter from a companion star accretes on to a compact object which is usually a black hole or a neutron star .",
    "the structure of such disks can be described in the  @xmath0-disk \" prescription @xcite which is often referred to as the standard accretion disk model .",
    "most of the energy is released in the inner regions of the disk and is radiated at x - ray energies and hence these systems are observed as x - ray binaries .",
    "the flux generated and the temperature of the disk decreases with radius and hence the outer regions of the disk emit in uv or in the optical . however , there are couple of ways by which the outer region of the disk effects the x - ray emission from the inner parts .",
    "if the outer region is non - ionised the disk becomes unstable .",
    "this hydrogen ionised thermal instability leads to a long term limit cycle like variability in the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "this is believed to be the origin of x - ray novae where an x - ray binary rises from quiescence on a time - scale of days and subsequently its luminosity decays in months time - scale .",
    "x - ray novae typically recur in time - scales of decades . for persistent x - ray binaries ,",
    "the outer disk is perhaps always ionised and hence such systematic long term variation is not seen .",
    "however , even for such persistent sources the x - ray emission displays stochastic variability in a wide range of time - scales ranging from milli - seconds to months . while the short term variability should arise from the inner regions , it is the outer regions which is thought to be responsible for the long term variation .",
    "a popular model for the long term variability is the stochastic fluctuation model @xcite where fluctuations in different radii of the disk , induce accretion rate variations in the viscous time - scale of that radius .",
    "these accretion rate variations then propagate inwards and cause the observed long term x - ray variability .",
    "thus , the outer region of an x - ray disk effects the x - ray emission from the inner parts by regulating the accretion rate inflow into the inner region .    on the other hand ,",
    "as noted and described by @xcite , the x - ray irradiation by the inner regions can affect the structure of the outer one .",
    "there have been several works to understand the structure and the resultant spectra of the outer regions in the presence of x - ray irradiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the reprocessed emission will be emitted in uv / optical and the spectra of such disks has been calculated and compared to observations @xcite .",
    "the detailed vertical structure of such disks which depends on the radiative and heat transfer processes have been studied to better understand their spectral properties @xcite .",
    "the global structure of such irradiated disks is also expected to be complex with several studies showing that the disk may be warped or inflated @xcite .",
    "the effect on the stability of the disk , especially on the thermal hydrogen ionised instability during an x - ray novae outburst has been studied @xcite and found to be important .",
    "thus , this is an interesting situation where , while the accretion rate in the inner regions ( and hence the x - ray flux ) can be modulated by the outer disk , the outer disk itself can be strongly affected by the variations in the x - ray flux . in such systems involving feedback ,",
    "there are possibilities of characteristic behaviour such as limit cycle oscillations , resonance or enhanced variability .",
    "we study here these effects by computing the response of such an x - ray irradiated disk to perturbations , using a global time dependent hydrodynamic code . for simplicity and to understand the basic phenomenon , we restrict the analysis to fully ionised disks without warps .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the steady state x - ray irradiated disks and quantify the regions of such disk where irradiation changes the disk structure . using the known orbital properties of some x - ray binaries",

    "this essentially tells us how the inner accretion rate ( i.e. the x - ray emission ) responds to a perturbation at a given outer radius .",
    "the ratio is plotted for different perturbation radii in figure [ tp_mdot ] .",
    "the ratio is nearly unity when the time period is longer than the viscous time - scale and is significantly less than one , when the time period is smaller . to understand the effect of the x - ray irradiation",

    "however , when the perturbation is introduced at radii larger than the transition one , the induced variation in @xmath173 is larger for the case with feedback .",
    "this suggests that the effect of x - ray irradiation is to enhance the variability at time - scales larger than the viscous time - scale of the transition radius .",
    "our study of a time - dependent x - ray irradiated disk shows that the response of the inner accretion rate is different for a perturbation introduced in the x - ray irradiation dominated part of the disk compared to one at radii less than the transition one .",
    "since the viscous time - scale at the transition radius is @xmath162 secs , this effect will be observable only by decades long monitoring of these sources .",
    "using the all sky monitor ( asm ) data of the rxte satellite , @xcite have reported breaks in the power spectra of several x - ray binaries indicating that the power at frequencies below the break frequency is less than expected .",
    "this is in contrast to the results obtained in this work , which suggests that the variability at low frequency should be enhanced .",
    "more seriously , as noted by @xcite , the break frequencies occur in the range @xmath174 - @xmath175 hz which is much shorter than the viscous time - scale of the outermost radius and the viscous time - scale of the transition radius .",
    "this indicates that the breaks reported by @xcite maybe a different phenomenon unrrelated to the effects of x - ray irradiation studies here .",
    "however given that the asm data is not continuous and maybe affected by systematic effects , it is difficult to make a comparison .",
    "moreover , the results of this work are based on simplistic assumptions which may need to be lifted before a meaningful comparison with observations is possible .",
    "we have assumed that the disk is fully ionised but the temperature estimated at the transition radius ( @xmath176 k ) indicates that the disk would be partially ionised .",
    "the most dominant effect would be that a partially ionized disk will have additional opacity due to absorption .",
    "the structure of the disk when x - ray irradiation dominates does not depend on the opacity and hence will not be affected .",
    "however , the transition radius may change leading to a different viscous time - scale where the effect of x - ray irradiation maybe observed .",
    "thus while a time - dependent formalism that computes the ionisation state of the disk at each radii maybe challenging , it maybe required to predict the quantitative behaviour of the disk .",
    "perhaps a more important effect which may change the qualitative nature of the result obtained here , is if the irradiated part of the disk is warped , especially if the warping follows any temporal x - ray modulation .",
    "a more sophisticated comprehensive treatment is required to understand the effects of these aspects .",
    "an important future study would be to predict the time varying broadband spectrum from such x - ray irradiated disks .",
    "this would require estimating the effective temperature at each radius .",
    "while the structure of the disk is affected by the x - ray irradiation only beyond the transition radius , the effective temperature will depend on the time - dependent x - ray emission at much smaller radii .",
    "the uv / optical emission would have contribution from a span of radii where the effective temperature will have complex temporal behaviour .",
    "the study can predict the relative r.m.s variation as well as time - lags between the x - ray and different uv / optical bands . for some x - ray binaries",
    "there is evidence that the short time - scale correlation between the x - ray and optical band is complex i.e. although x - ray reprocessing could be a factor , the optical variability could also be due to other contibutions such as a jet emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this complex short as well as long term behaviour can be tested using data from the forthcoming x - ray satellite astrosat @xcite which can simultaneously and sensitively measure the optical / uv and x - ray emission from such sources .",
    "thus , the present work lays the foundation for future studies which will enhance our understanding of the outer accretion disks of x - ray binaries .",
