    "more than three decades of multi - wavelength observations of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have revealed that these objects are powerful emitters of variable radiation from the radio band to @xmath0-ray energies and that most of the radiation is emitted in the optical - uv band and in the x - rays . in the current leading scenario ,",
    "agn are powered by accretion onto a central supermassive black hole , the optical - uv emission is thermal radiation produced ( directly and/or via reprocessing ) from the accretion flow , and the x - rays are produced through comptonisation process in a putative corona . while this general picture is widely accepted ,",
    "the details concerning the interaction between disc and corona as well as the geometry and physical state of the latter ( for example , thermal static vs.  cool \" dynamic medium ) and the origin of the variability in different bands ( e.g. , intrinsic disc emission variation vs. reprocessing of the x - ray emission ) are still poorly understood .",
    "one of the best way to address these outstanding open questions is to investigate the long - term variability in several different energy bands that track the activity of the main components of the central engine , namely the disc and the corona . in recent years",
    ", several multi - wavelength variability studies have confirmed the validity of this approach and revealed in some cases the existence of coordinated variability patterns and in others the lack of coordinated changes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this apparent discrepancy of long - term behaviour in different agn can be partly ascribed to the lack of simultaneous coverage and to the difficulty of adequately capturing the disc activity using ground - based optical telescopes that are often hampered by weather conditions .",
    "however , it could also be due to intrinsic differences in some fundamental properties of the central engine , such as the bh mass , @xmath1 , and the accretion rate in eddington units , @xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to shed further light on the link between disc and corona , it is crucial to simultaneously study in different energy bands the activity of variable black hole systems whose @xmath1 and @xmath2 are well constrained .",
    "the advent of  with its flexibility coupled with the simultaneous coverage of several bands in the optical / uv and in the x - rays offers the ideal tool for this kind of studies .    over the last few years",
    ", we have carried out a multi - wavelength campaign of the x - ray bright radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 )  with , the atca , , and with .",
    "the long - term  monitoring indicates that  is highly variable on timescales ranging from minutes to years with frequent flares and continuous ",
    "achromatic \" large - amplitude variations that are similar to the behaviour shown by galactic black holes in highly - accreting intermediate spectral states @xcite .",
    "the radio observations reveal the presence of aligned extended structures suggesting the presence of bipolar jets with a relatively large viewing angle @xcite .",
    "a deep  observation ( 5 consecutive orbits ) indicates that lacks any significant intrinsic absorption and strong reflection features ; the source has x - ray spectral and temporal variability typical of radio - quiet seyfert galaxies , and has a highly variable soft excess well described by a low - temperature comptonisation model @xcite . a 10-day monitoring campaign in september 2008 with  combined with simultaneous  and archival radio data constrains the black hole mass to @xmath3 confirming that  is accreting at or above the eddington limit .",
    "the observations also reveal that the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is dominated by the optical - uv emission , and that the jet appears to be relevant only in the radio band @xcite .    based on these findings",
    ", we can conclude that  is a  clean \" system accreting at super - eddington rate , ideal to study the central engine and specifically the disc - corona interaction in the high - accretion regime . for this purpose",

    "important physical insights into the nature of the central engine of  may be obtained from the time delay between the changes occurring in the different energy bands probed by the xrt and uvot . to this end , we calculated the cross correlation function ( ccf ) between the uvw2 flux ( which is the most variable uvot band and likely tracks the behaviour of the inner disc ) and the other uvot filters as well as the count rate in the 0.310 kev energy band .",

    "our 1.5 year  campaign revealed that  is significantly variable in all the energy bands covered by the uvot with moderately large amplitude variations occurring on timescales of months with variability levels increasing from the reddest ( @xmath45% ) to the bluest filter ( @xmath44% ) .",
    "the uvot variability is substantially lower than the x - ray variability , in agreement with the findings of @xcite , who studied the variability of the largest sample of agn with simultaneous coverage of the uv and x - ray energy ranges and found that uv emission only varies marginally .",
    "+ the disc component is reasonably well fitted by a discpn model and the @xmath109 variability appears to be dominated by variations of the disc normalization , which depends on physical properties of the system that are constant ( such as the distance , the black hole mass , and the inclination angle ) and on the colour factor , whose temporal evolution is poorly understood .",
    "the limited number of data points in the optical - uv bands do not allow to use more sophisticated disc models that may provide more direct clues on the dominant variable physical parameters of the accretion flow . nevertheless , following @xcite",
    ", we can speculate that the disc variations observed in  can be explained by local @xmath74 fluctuations in a strongly inhomogeneous disc . +",
    "a model - independent analysis based on the light curve of @xmath41 confirms the presence of persistent broadband spectral variability with @xmath41 ranging between 1.10 and 1.35 .",
    "the existence of significant intrinsic variability , @xmath42% .",
    "is in agreement with recent findings from @xcite that were derived from a systematic study of the @xmath41 variability of the bright , soft x - ray selected sample of agn observed with  @xcite . combining the variability range of @xmath41 with the fact that throughout the monitoring campaign the hard x - ray photon index varies in the 1.82.4 range , makes it possible to locate in the region of the @xmath135 diagram consistent with gbhs in the intermediate state ( see figure 6 of @xcite ) . *",
    "_ correlation analysis : _ a combined study of the  uvot and xrt light curves of  indicates that the uvw2 data are highly correlated with all the other uvot bands and weakly correlated with the xrt .",
    "a ccf analysis confirms these results and suggests the presence of an evolution trend in the time lags , although not at a statistically significant level .",
    "more specifically , the changes in the optical bands appear to lead those in the uv bands , which in turn lead the x - ray variations .",
    "+ these results do not support the  reprocessing model \" , where the uv variable component is thought to be caused by x - ray irradiation from the corona .",
    "indeed , several past studies have favored this model for different agn ( e.g. , mrk  79 , @xcite ; ngc  3783 , @xcite ; ngc  4051 , @xcite ) , including a recent work based on the long - term  monitoring of the low mass agn , ngc  4395 @xcite . however , in the reprocessing scenario x - ray changes are predicted to lead the uv , which in turn should lead the optical band variation , which is at odds with the observational results of .",
    "+ on the other hand , this trend appears to be consistent with a scenario where perturbations rapidly propagate from the outer part of the accretion flow ( responsible for the optical emission ) to the inner hotter region ( that emits uv and is closely connected to the x - ray emitting corona ) .",
    "a possible problem with this interpretation is that the time lags inferred from the ccf analysis ( see table 1 ) appear to be significantly shorter than the predicted propagation timescales in a standard accretion disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the apparent discrepancy between measured time lags and predicted propagation timescales can be reconciled considering that  is likely accreting at or above the eddington rate and therefore its accretion flow can not be parametrized by a standard accretion disc but rather by a slim disc whose typical timescales are considerably shortened ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "+ another possible problem for the propagation model is the amplitude of the variations : the fractional variability measured in the uv bands is larger than the one measured in the optical bands both in percentage and using physical units ( i.e. , multiplying @xmath132 by the average luminosity in each specific energy band : @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) .",
    "however , the emission from the inner disc regions can be additionally affected by localized variations which do not influence the emission of the optical band produced at larger radii .",
    "if these putative variations are of larger amplitude ( which is plausible , since most of the energy is released in the inner part of the disc ) , then the different levels of variability of  measured by the uvot can be reconciled with the inward propagation scenario .",
    "furthermore , these extra variations may also explain the fact that the correlation between the uv and the optical bands is not as strong as the correlation among uv bands .",
    "this scenario can also explain the observed delay of x - ray light curves with respect to the uv .    in conclusion",
    ", our study confirms that  is a highly accreting system , whose optical , uv , and x - ray radiation is dominated by accretion - related emission . on long timescales ,  is highly variable at all wavelengths probed by the uvot and xrt with variability levels decreasing from the x - rays ( @xmath43% ) , to the uv ( @xmath44% ) , to the optical band ( @xmath142% ) .",
    "the large - amplitude variations measured by the bluest uv filter ( uvw2 ) are highly correlated with all the other uvot bands and weakly ( but significantly ) correlated with the x - ray variations , implying a physical link between disc and corona .",
    "the ccf results provide suggestive evidence for perturbations that rapidly propagate from the outer to the inner parts of the accretion flow and to the corona , favoring the inward propagation scenario over the reprocessing one .",
    "however , the latter can not be completely ruled out , since it may occur and dominate on timescales shorter than those probed in our long - term campaign with weekly cadence .",
    "finally , the positive correlation between the soft x - ray flux and the hard photon index suggests that in pks 0558-504 the seed photons are provided to the corona by the soft excess component , which may represent the  hot skin \" of the accretion disk .",
    "this work demonstrates that the simultaneous investigation of uv , optical , and x - ray variability in agn is one of the most effective tools to shed light on their central engine .",
    "further progress can be obtained by targeting highly variable , clean systems ( i.e. , without prominent intrinsic absorption , warm absorbers , and jets ) , whose @xmath1 and @xmath2 are well constrained .",
