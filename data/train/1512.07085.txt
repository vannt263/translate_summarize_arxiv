    "it can be seen from this figure that ferromagnetic alignment of the spins is preferred along the [ 100 ] direction , and antiferromagnetic alignment of the spins is preferred along the [ 110 ] direction .",
    "distances along the _ c _ axis , or [ 001 ] , are also shown .",
    "the correlations for these pairs of spins are positive and significantly smaller than the in - plane correlations .",
    "the signs of magnetic interactions along these three crystallographic directions are the same as those observed in the lro state below @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : npd]a ) .",
    "the reduced magnitude of @xmath60 along [ 001 ] relative to [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] shows that the magnetic interactions are relatively weak between the mn layers .",
    "the correlation length associated with the sro can be defined by how rapidly the @xmath60 decrease with _",
    "r_. for this purpose , the absolute value of the spin - pair correlation function is examined .",
    "figure [ fig : diffuse]d displays the data for pairs that lie within a mn layer ( intraplanar , solid symbols ) and pairs which lie within two neighboring mn layers , separated by one unit cell along the _ c _ axis ( interplanar , open symbols ) .",
    "these sets form two well - separated branches on the @xmath62 plot .",
    "each is fitted with an exponential decay toward zero @xmath63 .",
    "the resulting correlation lengths @xmath55 are shown on the figure . as expected , the correlation length within the layers is larger than that between the layers .",
    "the values are consistent with that approximated by the width of the strongest diffuse scattering feature in figure [ fig : npd]d . in the _ ab _",
    "plane , @xmath55 corresponds to approximately two unit cells . for pairs of spins in neighboring layers ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath55 is likely less reliable , since it is smaller than the smallest distance used to determine it .",
    "however , it does indicate weaker magnetic correlations along the _ c _ axis , as may be expected . in the related compound bamn@xmath9as@xmath9 , which is structurally less anisotropic than lamnaso",
    ", exchange interactions along the layer stacking direction have been estimated to be about 10 times weaker than in - plane interactions @xcite .",
    "this analysis of the diffuse magnetic scattering reveals that the magnetic order in lamnaso is short - range and nearly two dimensional between 650 and 360k .",
    "it is interesting to consider whether similar magnetic correlations exist above the long - range ordering temperature in related materials , including other mn based 1111 and 122 compounds .",
    "several examples can be found in the literature .",
    "_ noted some diffuse intensity attributed to sro at 350k in prmnaso@xmath7f@xmath8 ( @xmath0=340k ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , in cemnaso ( @xmath0=347k ) a broad magnetic peak was observed up to about 420k @xcite .",
    "in addition , neutron diffraction data collected at 600k from ba@xmath64k@xmath65mn@xmath9as@xmath9 ( @xmath0=575k ) @xcite and at 650k from bamn@xmath9as@xmath9 ( @xmath0=625k ) @xcite show the presence of diffuse scattering .",
    "thus , it appears that sro above @xmath0 is a common feature of the magnetism in mn - based 1111 and 122 type compounds , and may have been overlooked in previous studies of the other materials listed in table [ tab : compare ] that focused primarily on the long range magnetic order .",
    "polarized inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed to examine the magnetic excitation spectrum of lamnaso in both the lro and sro states .",
    "results of measurements using the spin - flip configuration are shown in figure [ fig : ins - maps ] .",
    "measurements at 300k , below @xmath0 , reveal the presence of well - defined spin - wave excitations located near a momentum transfer @xmath66=1.6@xmath67 .",
    "the feature was not observed in the non - spin - flip configuration , demonstrating that it is magnetic in nature .",
    "the momentum transfer at which the strong inelastic scattering is centered is close to that where the strongest magnetic bragg peaks and the maximum in the diffuse magnetic scattering are located ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diffuse]d ) . at 300k",
    ", a gap is observed in the magnetic excitation spectrum , which arises from magnetic anisotropy in the lro state .",
    "the gap is estimated to be 3.5mev from the present data . as noted above",
    ", the spectrum is very narrow in _ q _ , indicating the spin waves producing this feature are very sharply dispersing .",
    "this scattering is quite similar to the polycrstalline averaged spectrum produced from spin - wave calculations on bamn@xmath9as@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "non - polarized measurements using higher incident energy neutrons showed that the magnetic spectrum in lamnaso extends to beyond 30mev , and evidence for magnetic excitations extending up to @xmath68100mev is seen in bamn@xmath9as@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the stiff spin wave spectra in these materials indicate strong magnetic exchange interactions and are consistent with the observed high magnetic ordering temperatures .    as the temperature is raised above @xmath0=360k , the inelastic magnetic scattering ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diffuse]b , c ) remains narrow in _ q _ ; however , the spin - gap vanishes with the long - range order . just above @xmath0 , at 370k , very intense quasielastic scattering associated with the short range magnetic order is observed at 1.6@xmath67 .",
    "this quasielastic scattering is suppressed strongly as temperature is increased further , as seen by comparison of the data at 370k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diffuse]b ) and 385k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diffuse]c ) .",
    "_ cuts through the spectra are collected in figure [ fig : diffuse]d , which shows the spin - gap at 300k , strong , low - energy scattering at 370k , and weaker magnetic scattering at 385k that still extends up beyond 12mev .",
    "the scaling of the energy gap with the ordered moment is expected as the the thermal energy overcomes the magnetic anisotropy energy , leading to a gradual decay of the spin correlations and thus to a short range order .",
    "however , the strong exchange interaction makes the magnetic excitations persist at temperatures well above the lro regime .",
    "the long range antiferromagnetic order present at room temperature in lamnaso vanishes above @xmath0=360k .",
    "no corresponding anomaly is detected in the magnetic susceptibility , because short range magnetic order is present above @xmath0 .",
    "this short range order extends up to @xmath3=650k .",
    "a change is observed in the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility at @xmath3 .",
    "analysis of the diffuse magnetic scattering shows that the magnetic correlations associated with the short range order are anisotropic , with longer correlation length ( @xmath69 10 ) in the _ ab_-plane than along the _ c_-axis ( @xmath69 5 ) .",
    "the magnetic exchange is similar to that in the long range ordered state : antiferromagnetic along the edge of the mn square lattice and ferromagnetic between layers .",
    "comparison of the long range ordered magnetic structures of related compounds shows that the magnetic exchange along the stacking direction is determined by the mn _",
    "d_-orbital crystal field splitting , with a strong correlation between @xmath25mn@xmath26 bond angle and the layer stacking sequence .",
    "this suggests chemical substitutions or applied pressure may be used to switch the interlayer magnetic coupling . a gap of about 3.5ev in the magnetic excitation spectrum of lamnaso",
    "is observed at room temperature ( below @xmath0 ) , arising from magnetic anisotropy . steeply dispersing spin waves",
    "extend beyond 30mev and indicate strong magnetic exchange interactions consistent with high magnetic ordering temperatures .",
    "very strong quasielastic scattering associated with the short range magnetic order is seen just above @xmath0 .",
    "comparison with neutron powder diffraction data from other _",
    "_ ln__mnaso and bamn@xmath9as@xmath9 based materials shows that short ranged order above @xmath0 may be a common fundamental behavior of these quasi - two dimensional magnetic materials .",
