    "density - functional calculations provide reliable information about the ground state properties of electron systems but give , in principle , no access to the excitation spectrum of the system under study .",
    "excitations can be described by many - body perturbation theory which is , however , at present only computationally feasible for real materials in its simplest form , the @xmath0 approximation of hedin.@xcite the latter gives a comparatively simple expression for the self - energy operator , which allows the one - particle green s function of an interacting many - electron system to be described in terms of the green s function of a hypothetical non - interacting system with an effective potential .",
    "the green s function contains information not only about the ground - state density and energy but also about the quasiparticle ( qp ) spectrum .",
    "the @xmath0 approximation has been successfully applied to the calculation of qp bandstructures of semiconductors and other materials,@xcite for a recent review see ref .  .",
    "the real - space imaginary - time @xmath0 method , first proposed by rojas _",
    "et al._@xcite and  in a revised form  described in detail by rieger",
    "_ et al._@xcite ( we will refer to this paper as cpc i in the following ) offers a more favourable scaling of the computational effort with system size than conventional reciprocal - space @xmath0 schemes.@xcite it substantially reduces the computational effort and allows to study larger systems than previously possible without resorting to further approximations such as plasmon - pole models@xcite for the energy dependence of the screened interaction or model dielectric functions.@xcite    the new features outlined in the present paper , particularly the new treatment of the ( imaginary ) time / energy dependence , further reduce the computational effort of the space - time @xmath0 scheme by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "this is achieved by fitting the smoothly decaying large energy / time tails of all quantities involved in a @xmath0 calculation to simple model functions and treating the remaining time / energy region numerically on a gauss - legendre grid rather than using an equidistant grid and fast fourier transformations ( fft ) from time to energy and vice versa . in the new scheme",
    "these fourier transformations are performed by a combination of analytic integration of the tails and gauss - legendre quadrature of the remaining part .",
    "another improvement of the method concerns the convergence of the calculated green s function with the number of unoccupied eigenstates entering the eigenstate ( band ) sum in the green s function eq .",
    "( [ gldast ] ) below .",
    "higher unoccupied eigenstates are approximated by plane waves .",
    "this considerably reduces the number of eigenstates and energies which have to be computed in a density - functional calculation ( usually within the local density approximation ( lda ) ) preceding a calculation of the self - energy with a given accuracy .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : first we give a brief summary of the real - space imaginary - time @xmath0 scheme in order to clarify notation in reference to cpc i ( section [ sec : method ] ) .",
    "then we describe the new treatment of the time / energy dependence ( section [ sec : glg ] ) and the plane - wave substitution for accelerating the unoccupied - state sum convergence of the green s function ( section [ sec : pwt ] ) .",
    "in the real - space imaginary - time @xmath0 method@xcite for computing electron self - energies and related quantities such as dielectric response functions and quasiparticle energies the basic quantities green s function , dielectric response function , dynamically screened coulomb interaction and self - energy are represented on a real - space grid and on the imaginary time axis . in those intermediate steps of the calculation where it is computationally more efficient to work in reciprocal space and imaginary energy we change to the latter representation by means of fourier transforms .",
    "the choice of representing the time / energy dependence on the imaginary instead of on the real axis allows us to deal with smooth , decaying quantities which give faster convergence . to obtain the self - energy eventually on the real energy axis ,",
    "we fit a model function to the computed self - energy on the imaginary axis , and continue it analytically to the real axis .",
    "the energy dependence of the dynamically screened interaction is fully taken into account within the method .",
    "the computational effort scales quadratically with the number of atoms in the unit cell and linearly with the number of energy points @xmath1 used to represent the energy dependence.@xcite",
    "first , the zeroth - order green s function is constructed in real space and imaginary time : @xmath2   & & = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll }   \\phantom{- }   i \\sum\\limits_{n\\bk}^{occ}\\psi_{n\\bk}(\\br)\\psi^*_{n\\bk}(\\br ' )     \\exp(\\epsilon_{n\\bk}\\tau ) , & \\tau > 0 , \\\\[12pt ] -i \\sum\\limits_{n\\bk}^{unocc}\\psi_{n\\bk}(\\br)\\psi^*_{n\\bk}(\\br ' )     \\exp(\\epsilon_{n\\bk}\\tau ) , & \\tau < 0 , \\nonumber \\\\ \\\\ \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the lda wavefunctions @xmath3 and eigenvalues @xmath4 .",
    "then the rpa irreducible polarizability is formed in real space and imaginary time : @xmath5 and fourier transformed to reciprocal space and imaginary energy and the symmetrised dielectric matrix@xcite is constructed in reciprocal space , @xmath6 after that the symmetrised dielectric matrix is inverted for each @xmath7 point and each imaginary energy in reciprocal space and the screened coulomb interaction is calculated : @xmath8 and fourier transformed to real space and imaginary time . from that the self - energy operator @xmath9 and its expectation values @xmath10 are computed .",
    "the latter are fourier transformed to imaginary energy and fitted to a model function allowing analytic continuation onto the real energy axis and evaluation of the quasiparticle corrections to the lda eigenvalues by first - order perturbation theory in @xmath11 .",
    "since all quantities go to zero with increasing @xmath12 we use a finite cutoff region in real space which we call the interaction cell .",
    "further details of the method can be found in cpc i.",
    "the functions we are dealing with are relatively smooth on the imaginary time / energy axis .",
    "this allows to employ a regular time / energy grid which has the advantage that the fourier transformation from imaginary time to imaginary energy and vice versa can be done efficiently by fast fourier transformation ( fft ) .",
    "however , we still need of the order of 100 grid points@xcite for good convergence ( resulting quasiparticle energies converged within 30 mev with respect to the @xmath13/@xmath14 grid parameters ) .",
    "this point is illustrated by figure [ sigwmax ] showing the matrix element of the correlation self - energy@xcite for the uppermost valence band of si at @xmath15 , calculated ( with @xmath16 = 0.17 hartree ) with 30 , 60 , and 120 fft grid points ( a ) on the imaginary energy axis and ( b ) analytically continued to real energies .",
    "crucially , the convergence on the imaginary axis transforms into a convergence of similar quality on the real axis upon analytic continuation .",
    "looking at the time / energy behaviour of the key quantities , particularly those which have to be fourier transformed such as polarizability , screened interaction and the matrix elements of the self - energy ( see figure [ siform ] ) we observe that they possess nontrivial structure only in the region close to @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) whereas they decay smoothly to zero for large imaginary times or energies .",
    "the fft grid has to be large enough to take account of the tails ( reduce aliasing ) and at the same time it needs to be sufficiently dense to describe the structure in the region close to the origin properly .",
    "this suggests another approach : represent the functions on a suitably chosen grid in a fixed and comparatively small time / energy interval and fit the large @xmath19/@xmath20 tails to simple model functions which can be fourier transformed analytically , a method suggested by blase _",
    "et al._@xcite in the context of their earlier mixed - space method.@xcite for the part handled numerically we choose a gauss - legendre ( gl ) grid ( linearly transformed from ( -1,1 ) to ( 0,@xmath21 ) or ( 0,@xmath22 ) , respectively ) .",
    "this turns out to be very efficient since the functions have to be computed for a relatively small number of time or energy points only and this computation of the functions is much more time - consuming than the fourier transformations themselves which are done by gaussian quadrature over the numerical values and adding the fourier transform of the tail.@xcite the fit of the tail only needs to be performed whenever a quantity has to be fourier transformed from @xmath19 to @xmath20 or vice versa .",
    "the rest of the calculation is restricted to the gl grid .",
    "hence the following quantities have to be fitted : ( 1 ) the polarizability @xmath23 , ( 2 ) the screened coulomb interaction @xmath24 and ( 3 ) the matrix elements of the correlation part of the self - energy @xmath25 .",
    "= 3.25 in    the advantages of this treatment of the time / energy dependence are obvious : all quantities have to be computed for a much smaller number of imaginary times / energies thus saving computational time and reducing storage requirements while retaining the flexibility to accomodate general functional forms of the energy dependence and not being restricted to particular forms such as plasmon - pole models .",
    "the imaginary - time dependence of the green s function derives from the the decaying exponentials @xmath26 with @xmath27 for @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ gldast ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior at large imaginary times is determined by the slowest - decaying exponentials and can thus be approximated by a single exponential .",
    "this asymptotic imaginary - time dependence carries over to the polarizability eq .",
    "( [ chi0 ] ) .",
    "for that reason we fit the large-@xmath19 tails of each @xmath29 element of the polarizability @xmath23 @xcite to a decaying exponential @xmath30 ( with @xmath31 and for @xmath32 only since @xmath33 is symmetric in @xmath13 ) .",
    "the two fit parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 are exactly determined by fitting two time points : the outermost gl grid point and one additional point at @xmath36 .",
    "this fitting procedure turns out to be very reliable .",
    "the fourier transformation from @xmath19 to @xmath20 is done in the following way :",
    "@xmath37 exp(-\\omega_j \\tau_i )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}d\\tau\\ ; a\\ ; exp(-b|\\tau| )   exp(-\\omega_j \\tau ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{i_{max } } p_i\\ ;   [ { \\bar   \\chi}^0 ( i\\tau_i ) - a\\ ; exp(-b|\\tau_i| ) ] \\ ; cos ( \\omega_j \\tau_i ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{2 a}{b^2 + \\omega^2_j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with gl grid points @xmath38 and @xmath39 , gl weights @xmath40 , fit parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and @xmath41 .    for a small number of matrix elements @xmath42 ( typically less than 5% of all matrix elements as long as @xmath21 is large enough to accomodate all the nontrivial structure of @xmath43 ) the large @xmath19 tails can not be fitted to a decaying exponential because they increase or change sign .",
    "this is only the case for small matrix elements where the function is already close to zero at @xmath21 anyway .",
    "we set @xmath44 to @xmath45 there , i.  e.  choose a reasonable decaying constant which takes the ( already small ) function smoothly to zero . simply setting the matrix element to zero for @xmath46 would render the ensuing fit of @xmath24 unneccessarily difficult .",
    "anyhow , @xmath21 is a convergence parameter which can be varied to check the quality of the results .",
    "the large - imaginary - energy tail of the dynamically screened interaction @xmath47 is fitted to the fourier transform of a decaying exponential @xmath48 the energy region where @xmath49 is treated numerically has to be large enough to comprise the nontrivial structure of @xmath50 .",
    "we found that @xmath22 should be between 3 and 10 times the plasmon energy@xcite for good convergence .",
    "we could perform the tail fit along similar lines as that of @xmath51 , i.  e.  subtract the analytic tail function from the given imaginary - energy w in ( 0 , @xmath22 ) , fourier transform this difference numerically and add the analytically given fourier transform of the function fitted to the tail back in . however , for a large number of matrix elements @xmath47 the tail fit yields a negative @xmath52 because they decay more rapidly than @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the function @xmath54 has a pole inside the interval ( 0 , @xmath22 ) which does not allow the analytic fourier transformation to be performed and which makes the numerical fourier transformation of the difference between w and the fit function virtually impossible to compute .",
    "that is why we integrate the analytic tail function from @xmath22 to @xmath55 in this case , provided that @xmath56 .",
    "part of this integral can still be solved analytically whereas the remainder is treated numerically .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath57 is given by : @xmath58 with @xmath59\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the sine integral @xmath60 here @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the gl grid points , @xmath61 the gl weights , @xmath62 and @xmath52 the fit parameters and @xmath63 the outermost gl grid point .",
    "the integral on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ wfit2 ] ) is solved numerically using a transformed gl grid .",
    "it converges rapidly since the integrand is going to zero like @xmath64 .",
    "the second part of eq .",
    "( [ wfit2 ] ) is given analytically . in this way most @xmath47",
    "can be fitted except for a small number where @xmath65 ( this only occurs for matrix elements which are small anyway ) . in the latter case",
    "we take the correct value at @xmath22 smoothly to zero by setting @xmath52 to @xmath66 . again",
    ", the quality of the results can be checked by varying @xmath22 .",
    "the matrix elements of the correlation self - energy are fitted in a similar way as the polarizability . as the asymptotic time dependence of the self - energy",
    "is determined by that of the green s function which is ` shorter - ranged ' ( in imaginary time ) than @xmath49 we again fit to a decaying exponential @xmath67 .",
    "this time , however , we have to perform separate fits on the positive and negative half - axis since the self - energy is not symmetric in imaginary time .",
    "therefore we obtain two contributions to @xmath68 for positive imaginary energies ( with @xmath69 ) : @xmath70 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\;exp(-i\\omega_j\\tau_i ) + \\frac{a_+}{b_+ + i \\omega_j } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{i=-1}^{-i_{max } } p_i\\ ; [ { \\bar \\sigma}_c ( i\\tau_i ) - a_-   exp(-b_- |\\tau_i| ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\;exp(-i\\omega_j\\tau_i ) + \\frac{a_-}{b_- + i \\omega_j } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote gl grid points , @xmath40 gl weigths , and @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are the fit parameters .",
    "the self - energy matrix elements on the negative imaginary - energy half - axis are given by @xmath75 .",
    "all matrix elements of @xmath76 could be fitted in this way for all the systems investigated so far ( si , ge , gan ) .      in order to test the stability and accuracy of the tail fit and the convergence with the gl grid size we performed self - energy calculations for bulk si ( cutoff parameters are given in table [ glgpar ] and further details are as in cpc i ) .",
    ".cutoff and grid parameters used for the test calculations for si and zincblende gan , respectively , in section [ sec : glg ] of the present work . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     [ ganresult ]    it can be concluded from the fermi energy shifts @xmath77 shown in figure [ efshift ] that adding the pw contribution improves the convergence of absolute self - energies in qualitatively the same way as that of qp energy differences ( figures [ si.bconv ] and [ gan.bconv ] ) .    in summary , we find that the number of lda eigenstates ( bands ) needed to converge the qp energies within 30 mev can be considerably reduced by including the pw contribution described in section [ sec : pwtmethod ] in the calculation of the green s function .",
    "in the present work we described two new features which significantly enhance the power of the real - space imaginary - time @xmath0 scheme for the calculation of self - energies and related quantities of solids . fitting the smoothly decaying large - imaginary - energy / time tails and treating the remaining imaginary energy / time region numerically on a gauss - legendre grid allows to reduce the computational time and storage requirements of the method by a factor of seven to eight while retaining the flexibility to accomodate general functional forms of the energy dependence.@xcite the tail - fitting procedure suggested in the present work turned out to be accurate and reliable . substituting the contribution of higher unoccupied eigenstates to the green s function eq .",
    "( [ gldast ] ) with a sum of corresponding free - electron states ( plane waves ) accelerates the convergence of the eigenstate sum in eq .",
    "( [ gldast ] ) , thus substantially reducing the number of eigenstates and eigenvalues which have to be provided by a density - functional calculation preceding the calculation of the self - energy and simultaneously decreasing the computational effort for the calculation of the green s function itself .",

    "an alternative to a gl grid would be a grid which is more dense towards the origin by a suitable transformation of variables",
    ". however , such grids do not perform well in computing the ` fast - oscillating ' components , i.  e.  @xmath78 for large @xmath14 .    in our experience fitting in reciprocal space rather than in real space is both easier and more efficient .",
    "for very large systems where it is advantageous to use a real - space representation throughout@xcite the fit can of course also be done in real space .",
    "these quasiparticle energies are slightly different from those given in cpc i since head and wings of the dielectric matrix have not been computed separately using a different @xmath79 grid in the present paper .        for example , setting this energy shift to zero changes the calculated qp energies by less than 10 mev in the case of bulk si .",
