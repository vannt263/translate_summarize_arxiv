    "the search for particles beyond the standard model is one of the key issues of the atlas and cms experiments at lhc . in particular , these experiments could test the theories with extra dimensions , which aim to solve the hierarchy problem by bringing the gravity scale closer to the eletroweak scale ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in recent years",
    ", the scenario proposed by randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite , in which there are two ( 3 + 1)-dimensional branes separated in a 5th dimension , has attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "this model predicts a kaluza - klein tower of gravitons and a graviscalar , called radion , which stabilize the size of the extra dimension without fine tuning of parameters and is the lowest gravitational excitation in this scenario .",
    "the mass of radion is expected to be of order of @xmath0(tev ) , which implies that the detection of the radion will be the first signature of the rs model .",
    "several authors have discussed the search of the radion in _ inclusive _ processes at tevatron and lhc @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend these previous studies for _ exclusive _ processes , in which the hadrons colliding remain intact after the interaction , losing only a small fraction of their initial energy and escaping the central detectors @xcite .",
    "the signal would be a clear one with a radion tagged in the central region of the detector accompanied by regions of low hadronic activity , the so - called `` rapidity gaps '' .",
    "in contrast to the inclusive production , which is characterized by large qcd activity and backgrounds which complicate the identification of a new physics signal , the exclusive production will be characterized by a clean topology associated to hadron - hadron interactions mediated by colorless exchanges . in what follows",
    ", we will calculate the radion production considering photon - photon or pomeron - pomeron interactions for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions at lhc energies .",
    "in particular , we will extend for radion production the perturbative kmr model @xcite ( for a recent review see @xcite ) , which has been extensively used to calculate the exclusive diffractive production in hadron colliders considering pomeron - pomeron interactions , with predictions which are in agreement with the rates observed at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of the formalism necessary for",
    "calculate the radion production in electromagnetic and diffractive interactions in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "moreover , we discuss the extension of the survival probability gap for nuclear collisions . in section [ res ]",
    "we present our results for the radion production in @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 collisions for lhc energies .",
    "finally , in section [ sum ] we present a summary of our main conclusions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in figs . [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] we present our results for the dependence of the total cross section for radion production on the radion mass considering @xmath6 and @xmath7 interactions . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we calculate the cross section for @xmath1 collisions and tevatron ( @xmath8 tev ) and lhc ( @xmath9 tev ) energies . on the other hand , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we consider ( a ) @xmath10 and ( b ) @xmath2 collisions for lhc energies : @xmath11 tev and 8.8 tev , respectively . the @xmath12 mechanism provides a natural lower limit for the radion exclusive production rate .",
    "moreover , as the photon flux scales as the squared charged of the beam , @xmath13 , two photon cross sections are extremely enhanced for ion beams",
    ". however , they are ever smaller than the predictions for radion production by @xmath7 interactions in @xmath10 and @xmath14 collisions , independently of the model considered for the survival probability @xmath15 . in the case of @xmath1 collisions , they only are similar for large values of the radion mass . in comparison to the @xmath1 case , the @xmath7 predictions for @xmath5 ( @xmath2 )",
    "nuclear collisions are enhanced by a factor @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "however , they are strongly reduced by the survival probability . in the @xmath10 case",
    "the predictions obtained using the model proposed in @xcite and our naive model are very similar . in contrast , for @xmath2 collisions , they differ by a factor 5 . assuming the @xmath7 predictions obtained using our model for @xmath15 as being a lower bound and that @xmath18 gev , one obtain that the radion production by this mechanism is a factor 180 ( 36 ) larger than the @xmath6 predictions for @xmath3 ( @xmath2 ) collisions . in comparison to the exclusive higgs production in @xmath1 collisions",
    "@xcite we predict cross sections that are a factor @xmath19 larger .",
    "this enhancement is directly associated to the trace anomaly for gauge fields , which leads to additional effective radion coupling to gluons or photons .",
    "let us now to compute the production rates for lhc energies considering the distinct mechanisms .",
    "the results are presented in table [ tabradion ] . at lhc",
    "we assume the design luminosities @xmath20 mb@xmath21s@xmath21 for @xmath22 collisions at @xmath23 tev and a run time of @xmath24 s for collisions with protons ( ions ) .",
    "moreover , we also consider the upgraded @xmath2 scenario proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which analyse a potential path to improve the @xmath2 luminosity and the running time .",
    "these authors proposed the following scenario for @xmath2 collisions : @xmath25 mb@xmath21s@xmath21 and a run time of @xmath26 s. the corresponding event rates are presented in the third line of the table [ tabradion ] .",
    "our results indicate that for the default settings and running times , the statistics are marginal for @xmath3 collisions .",
    "consequently , the possibility to carry out a measurement of the radion in @xmath6 and @xmath7 interactions is virtually null in these collisions . on the other hand , in @xmath1 collisions",
    "the event rates are reasonable , in particular for @xmath7 interactions . in comparison to the inclusive radion production @xcite ,",
    "our predictions for exclusive production are a factor @xmath27 smaller . despite their much smaller cross sections ,",
    "the clean topology of exclusive radion production implies a larger signal to background ratio .",
    "therefore , the experimental detection is in principle feasible .",
    "however , the signal is expected to be reduced due to the event pileup which eliminates one of the main advantages of the exclusive processes .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath4 collisions it is expected to trigger on and carry out the measurement with almost no pileup @xcite . therefore , the upgraded @xmath4 scenario provides the best possibility to detect the radion in an exclusive process .",
    "@xmath1 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 + @xmath2 & @xmath30 & @xmath31 + & 3 & 60 + @xmath3 & @xmath32 & @xmath33 +    some comments are in order .",
    "the exclusive cross sections for radion production are inversely proportional to @xmath34 , which still is a free parameter . here",
    "we assume @xmath35 tev as in @xcite . moreover , our predictions are strongly dependent of the radion mass . in table [ tabradion ] we have considered @xmath18 gev .",
    "larger values imply that the radion measurement in exclusive processes would not be possible at lhc .",
    "finally , the value of the survival probability for processes involving nuclei still is an open question . in this paper",
    "we calculated the cross sections considering two phenomenological models for @xmath15 and estimated the event rates assuming a pessimistic scenario .",
    "however , these points deserve a more detailed study which we postpone for a future publication .",
    "exclusive processes have already been observed at the tevatron with rates in broad agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "it is expected that at lhc the addition of forward proton taggers @xcite to enhance the discovery and physics potential of the atlas , cms and alice detectors @xcite .",
    "one of the possible scenarios which could be analyzed is that proposed by randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite , which predicts the radion as the lowest gravitational excitation in order to stabilize the size of the extra dimension . as the mass of radion",
    "is expected to be @xmath36 tev , the detection of the radion will be the first signature of the rs model . in this paper",
    "we study the exclusive production of the radion in electromagnetic and diffractive hadron - hadron collisions at the lhc .",
    "we predict larger cross sections in comparison to the higgs production in exclusive processes .",
    "our results demonstrate that the diffractive production of radion is dominant and should be feasible of study at cern lhc .",
