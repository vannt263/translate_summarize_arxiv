    "among various theoretical attempts , the famous seesaw ideas provide us with a very natural way to understand why the masses of three known neutrinos are so tiny compared to the masses of other standard model ( sm ) fermions @xcite . in the canonical type - i seesaw mechanism , in which three right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos are introduced and lepton number violation is allowed , the effective mass matrix of three light majorana neutrinos @xmath0 is dramatically suppressed with respect to the electroweak scale if the rh neutrino mass matrix @xmath1 is located not far away from the typical scale of grand unified theories . as a rough estimate , if light neutrino masses are stabilized around the sub - ev scale and the dirac mass matrix @xmath2 between left- and right - handed neutrinos is comparable with the mass of the top quark , then @xmath3 is naturally expected .",
    "the testability of such conventional seesaw models is therefore questionable . on the other hand , it is difficult to embed rh neutrinos into a theoretical framework at low - energy scales [ e.g. , the tev scale to be explored by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) ] in a technically natural way while keeping the left - handed neutrinos to be light enough . for those realistically viable type - i or type - iii seesaw models with the tev - scale rh neutrinos , which could be experimentally accessible at the lhc , fine - tunings of cancellations among the contributions to @xmath0 from different heavy neutrinos have to be employed . these kinds of structural cancellations",
    "are usually attributed to some underlying flavor symmetries @xcite . in the type-(i+ii ) seesaw model , one may also assume the mass term coming from rh neutrinos to be comparable with the one coming from the triplet higgs , and thus , the light neutrino mass scale is brought down through a significant cancellation between these two mass terms @xcite .",
    "however , to generate appreciable collider signatures of the heavy seesaw particles at the lhc , such a scheme potentially suffers from dangerous radiative corrections and requires unnatural fine - tuning even at loop level @xcite .    in our recent work @xcite ,",
    "we have pointed out that the above - mentioned drawbacks of most tev - scale type - i , type - iii , and type-(i+ii ) seesaw models can be circumvented by considering the inverse seesaw model @xcite . in the latter framework",
    ", additional sm gauge singlets are adhibited together with a small majorana mass insertion which explicitly breaks the lepton number .",
    "the phenomenology of this inverse seesaw mechanism is very rich : on the one hand , non - unitary neutrino mixing and cp violation can naturally show up and are possible to be tested at the future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments ; on the other hand , the heavy seesaw particles may result in very attractive signatures of lepton - flavor - violating ( lfv ) processes at the lhc .",
    "since the heavy singlets possess opposite cp signs and compose the pseudo - dirac particles in pair , the lepton - number - violating ( lnv ) processes ( such as the like - sign di - lepton events at the lhc ) are significantly suppressed and practically invisible .",
    "however , the inverse seesaw scenario with three heavy singlet pairs contains too many free parameters and is not very predictive . to partly avoid this drawback",
    ", one may consider a simplified version of the generic inverse seesaw scenario by reducing its number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this sound motivation leads us to the minimal inverse seesaw scenario ( miss ) at the tev scale , in which only two pairs of the sm gauge - singlet neutrinos are introduced but the observed neutrino mass hierarchy and lepton flavor mixing can well be interpreted .",
    "the purpose of this work is to describe the miss , which contains only two rh neutrinos ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and two sm gauge singlets ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , and to explore some of its low - energy consequences on neutrino mixing and cp violation .",
    "the remainder of our work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : miss ] , we will introduce the miss and present some general formulas associated with the non - unitarity of the light neutrino mixing matrix . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phenomenon ] , we will constrain the parameter space of non - unitarity effects in the miss by using current experimental data , calculate the jarlskog invariants of leptonic cp violation , and discuss the discovery potential of such new cp - violating effects in the near detector of a neutrino factory .",
    "finally , a brief summary will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the miss is constructed by extending the sm particle content with two rh neutrinos @xmath8 and two left - handed ( lh ) sm gauge singlets @xmath9 .",
    "the mass part of the neutrino sector lagrangian is then arranged so that it reads in the flavor basis @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a complex symmetric @xmath12 matrix and @xmath2 and @xmath1 are arbitrary @xmath13 and @xmath14 matrices , respectively . without loss of generality",
    ", one can always redefine the extra singlet fields and work in a basis where @xmath11 is real and diagonal , namely , @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "in addition to that , @xmath1 can be made hermitian by a further unitary transformation in the rh neutrino sector .",
    "the @xmath17 neutrino mass matrix in the basis @xmath18 is then rewritten as @xmath19 which is clearly a symmetric matrix with rank at most 6 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath1 is a sm singlet mass term , and hence , it is not governed by the scale of the @xmath20 symmetry breaking . in what follows , we will consider a particularly attractive case @xmath21 , with @xmath1 not far above the electroweak scale . in the limit @xmath22 , the rank of @xmath23 reduces from 6 to 4 , which leaves three light neutrinos massless . in reality , a tiny but non - vanishing @xmath11 can be viewed as a slight breaking of a global @xmath24 symmetry , and thus , it respects the naturalness criterion @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the original inverse seesaw scenario , the miss predicts one light neutrino to be exactly massless and brings in several interesting phenomena in neutrino oscillations and lfv processes .    at the leading order in @xmath25 , the light neutrino mass matrix in the miss",
    "is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a @xmath28 matrix .",
    "for @xmath11 around the kev scale , @xmath29 gives rise to the desired sub - ev light neutrino masses . in the limit @xmath30",
    ", we have @xmath31 , which corresponds to the lepton number symmetry restoration .",
    "the heavy sector consists of a pair of pseudo - dirac neutrinos @xmath32 @xcite with a tiny mass splitting between the relevant cp - conjugated majorana components of the order of @xmath11 .",
    "one can diagonalize @xmath33 by means of a unitary transformation @xmath34 with @xmath35 ( for @xmath36 ) denoting the light neutrino masses .",
    "we are left with either @xmath37 ( normal mass hierarchy @xmath38 , nh ) or @xmath39 ( inverted mass hierarchy @xmath40 , ih ) .",
    "note that @xmath41 itself is not the matrix that governs neutrino oscillations even if we choose a basis where the charged - lepton mass matrix is diagonal .",
    "the lh neutrinos entering the charged - current interactions of the sm are superpositions of the seven mass eigenstates @xmath42 given at the leading order by @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "hence , one can write @xmath46 the mixing between the doublet and singlet components in the charged currents results in several interesting phenomenological consequences :    * the flavor and mass eigenstates of the left - handed neutrinos are connected by a non - unitary flavor mixing matrix @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes of non - unitarity effects in different neutrino oscillation channels are predominated by the mass ratios between @xmath48 and @xmath1 , and in principle , their underlying correlations have to be taken into account in analyses of the future experiments . * the heavy singlets entering the charged currents due to the non - unitarity effects also enter the rare lepton decays , such as @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "hence , unlike in the type - i seesaw model , their contributions to the lfv decays are not suppressed by the light neutrino masses @xcite , but mainly constrained by the ratio @xmath51 , which in principle admits observing these events in the upcoming lhc experiments .",
    "for example , the decays @xmath52 are mediated by @xmath53 s and their branching ratios are given by @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 - 3x^3\\ln x/[2(1-x)^4]$ ] , and @xmath57 is the total width of @xmath58 .",
    "in the conventional type - i seesaw model ( i.e. , without unnatural cancellations ) , one has approximately @xmath59 , and therefore , @xmath60 indicates a strong suppression of lfv decays .",
    "however , in the inverse seesaw model , one can have sizable @xmath61 without any reference to the tiny neutrino masses , since the two issues are essentially decoupled .",
    "thus , appreciable lfv rates could be obtained even for strictly massless light neutrinos @xcite . *",
    "if the masses of the heavy singlets @xmath62 do not fall far beyond the electroweak scale , in the miss , as in the type - i seesaw model , one can expect an on - shell production of @xmath53 at the lhc via the gauge boson exchange diagrams",
    ". the most distinctive signature would be the observation of lfv processes involving three charged - leptons in the final state @xcite .    in comparison to the generic inverse seesaw scenario ,",
    "the miss is certainly more restrictive and predictive because of its much fewer free parameters and underlying correlations among physical observables , which could be well tested at a future neutrino factory . in the remaining part of this work",
    ", we will discuss the phenomenological consequences mentioned above in more detail and , in particular , concentrate on the possible non - unitary cp - violating effects in neutrino oscillations .",
    "as we have already mentioned , light neutrino mass eigenstates are connected to their flavor eigenstates by a non - unitary mixing matrix @xmath47 . in terms of the parametrization advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the non - unitary leptonic mixing is written as @xmath63 where the relevant hermitian matrix @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 and the unitary matrix @xmath41 can be parametrized in the standard form @xmath66 provided @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) .",
    "since one light neutrino mass is vanishing in the miss , we have only one majorana phase .",
    "the current experimental bounds on @xmath64 are rather stringent , implying that one can approximate @xmath72 s by the values of the mixing angles obtained from the neutrino oscillations .",
    "present data on atmospheric , solar , and reactor neutrinos yield two neutrino mass - squared differences @xmath73 and @xmath74 , together with three neutrino mixings @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "there is no hint on the cp - violating phases , and thus , we take @xmath78 and leave @xmath79 as a free parameter in the following calculations . as for the non - unitarity parameters , @xmath80 are constrained mainly from universality tests of weak interactions , rare leptonic decays , invisible width of the @xmath81-boson and neutrino oscillation data .",
    "the present bounds on @xmath80 ( at the 90  % c.l . )",
    "are @xcite : @xmath82    in order to study the connections among physical parameters in the miss , we adopt the parametrization of @xmath83 from the work in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely @xmath84 where @xmath85 for the nh case , and @xmath86 for the ih case . here",
    "@xmath87 is an arbitrary complex number with both @xmath88 and @xmath89 being real .",
    "for sake of simplicity , in what follows we will use the parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91{\\delta m^2_{21}/|\\delta m^2_{31}| } \\simeq 0.42 $ ] . in the nh case ,",
    "we obtain @xmath92 which yields @xmath93 thus , the only non - negligible off - diagonal entry is @xmath94 , and we have the relation @xmath95 because , to a good approximation , @xmath96 . similarly ,",
    "in the ih case , we obtain @xmath97 which translates into @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",

    "[ fig : eta ] and [ fig : mu ] . in total",

    "the points that are within the 90  % c.l .",
    "upper bounds on the non - unitarity parameters @xmath110 are plotted in the figures , where we do not resort to the approximate eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fnh])-([eq : etaih ] ) but rather utilize the precise eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) . as a result ,",
    "@xmath111 points build up each plot .",
    "using eq .  , one can easily estimate that @xmath112 should be ensured if there is no strong structural cancellations in @xmath83 .",
    "hence , in our numerical calculations , we set @xmath113 as a prior in order to avoid unnatural fine - tuning among model parameters .",
    "it is important to make clear that the decrease of the point - density towards smaller values of @xmath80 is a mere numerical artifact , since these regions correspond to a physically not very interesting situation , and hence , it does not make sense to scan over such areas thoroughly . on the other hand",
    ", the density reduction observed in the opposite ( i.e. , growing @xmath80 ) directions , c.f . , the two upper plots in fig .  [ fig : eta ] , provides a true physical information and all the following statements are based on such kind of physically relevant features .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] , we present the allowed regions for the absolute values of the relevant non - unitarity parameters .",
    "the upper - left plot shows the correlation between @xmath114 and @xmath115 , which is stronger in the ih case than in the nh case .",
    "this is expected , since the analytical approximation in the ih case is better than that in the nh case .",
    "the upper - right plot shows the cp - violating phase @xmath116 of the parameter @xmath94 , which is centered around 0 in the nh case and around @xmath117 in the ih case , in agreement with eqs .   and .",
    "thus , in both cases , it is hard to achieve a sizable @xmath115 and maximal cp - violating effects simultaneously .",
    "the bounds on the other @xmath64 parameters are shown in the plots in the second row of fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] .",
    "one can observe that @xmath118 is mainly constrained in the nh case , while @xmath119 is restricted in the ih case .",
    "the allowed region for @xmath120 is limited in both nh and ih cases , and there is no upgraded bound on @xmath121 .",
    "note that , in the nh case , the leading order formulae and do not provide as good approximation of the precise results as do the eqs .   and in the ih case , because the relevant effective expansion parameters ( i.e. , @xmath122 in the latter whilst only @xmath123 in the former case ) are not the same .",
    "this also imprints into the different widths of the red and blue bands in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] .",
    "the allowed regions for @xmath124 and @xmath125 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu ] .",
    "there is no strong constraint on @xmath88 .",
    "however , @xmath89 is bounded , since a larger @xmath89 corresponds to a more sever fine - tuning of the model parameters .",
    "as for the @xmath124 parameters , there are no generic upper bounds one should impose ; however , smaller values of @xmath124 correspond to a stronger fine - tuning entangled in @xmath83 .",
    "finally , let us summarize the upgraded bounds on the non - unitarity parameters we have obtained in the miss under consideration : @xmath126 , @xmath127 in the nh case , and @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 in the ih case .",
    "they could be helpful when building a specific and realistic model based on the miss .      in general , there are nine independent rephasing - invariant quantities that one can build at the quartic level out of the entries of a generic @xmath131 lepton mixing matrix @xmath132 @xcite , @xmath133 where the indices @xmath134 run over @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , while @xmath138 can be @xmath139 , @xmath71 and @xmath140 .",
    "note that all nine @xmath141 s coincide if @xmath132 is a unitary matrix , since all six unitarity triangles , despite their different shapes , span the same area @xcite .",
    "however , if non - unitarity effects ( like those studied in this work , i.e. , @xmath142 ) are present , this is no longer the case and one can expect deviations from such a simple picture driven by the relevant non - unitarity parameters ( denoted by @xmath110 in the current study ) . in such a case ,",
    "it is instructive to know which configuration of @xmath134 and @xmath138 is most affected for a specific non - unitarity pattern . in particular , to leading order in @xmath110 , one can write @xmath143 where @xmath144 governs the cp - violating effects in the unitary limit . the second term in eq .",
    "depends on the off - diagonal ( generally complex ) @xmath64 s , and hence , it does not necessarily vanish in the limit @xmath145 and might even dominate the cp - violating effects .",

    "however , these relations are mere reflections of the smallness of the mixing angle @xmath153",
    ".     constraints on the jarlskog invariants . here , only the nh case is considered , since the cp - violating effects due to the non - unitarity parameters are small in the ih case .",

    "[ fig : j ] , we illustrate the correlations between jarlskog invariants in the nh case .",
    "as we expect , they are linearly dependent , and the spread ( i.e. , the finite width of the allowed strips ) is due to higher - order corrections .",
    "although the magnitude of @xmath155 does not seem to be comparable to that of @xmath156 , we will show later that the cp - violating effects induced by the phases of non - unitarity parameters can be quite significant , since they are not suppressed by the small neutrino mass - squared difference @xmath157 . for the ih case , according to eq .  , @xmath158 are small quantities , and the phase of @xmath94 is close to @xmath159 , c.f .",

    "an interesting feature , which appears if @xmath116 is sizeable , is that the sensitivity of the near detector will be improved around the baseline length @xmath184 .",
    "this sensitivity enhancement could mainly be regarded as a compromise between new physics effects and the standard neutrino oscillation behavior . at a very short distance , the transition probability @xmath169",

    "<S> the jarlskog invariants of non - unitary cp violation are calculated , and the discovery potential of such new cp - violating effects in the near detector of a neutrino factory is discussed . </S>"
