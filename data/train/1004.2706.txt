    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ; _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) are widely interpreted as confirming the standard model of cosmology in which inflation generates a homogeneous and isotropic background and seeds isotropic , nearly scale - free perturbations .",
    "yet a variety of tests suggest that , on large scales , something may be amiss @xcite .",
    "( for a wide - ranging assessment of such anomalies in the 7-yr wmap data see ref .",
    "the interpretation of these results is complicated by the _ a posteriori _ nature of anomaly hunting : any large dataset will contain statistical flukes which , in isolation , can be made to look unacceptable .",
    "this is a particularly pernicious problem in the context of large - scale cosmology : with only one sky to observe , frequentist statistics are almost impossible to interpret .",
    "frequentist results can be made into more concrete bayesian statements by considering specific alternative cmb theories or classes of theories ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) . but a single , fixed dataset can still contribute overwhelming evidence in favour of or against the very same theory , depending on the alternatives against which we are judging ( for an elucidation of this point , see ref .",
    "@xcite , sec .",
    "5.5 ) . in other words",
    "there is no unique way to ascribe significance to departures from the standard theory .",
    "this does not imply we should abandon critical evaluations of wmap and other data : if we simply accept we have an ` unlikely ' realization of our favoured theory , we might miss the opportunity to discover new physics ( or instrumental systematics ) .",
    "thus frequentist results can not be dismissed out - of - hand ; but we would advocate their interpretation as pointers to interesting areas of work , rather than quantifiable death - knells of existing models or theories .    in the present work , we will consider a long - standing debate about the nature of the angular correlation function @xmath3 of the cmb .",
    "the argument is usually phrased in terms of the statistic @xmath4 , which traces the extent to which temperature fluctuations ( outside a galactic mask ) are correlated between points separated by @xmath5 or more . for a quantitative definition ,",
    "see section [ sec : background - notation ] .",
    "a number of recent works have attempted to assess the significance of the purportedly anomalous value of @xmath4 , reaching essentially contradictory conclusions . in particular",
    ", the frequentist @xmath6-value @xcite suggests the observed sky is highly anomalous , while a bayesian analysis of the optimally reconstructed sky by efstathiou _",
    "_ suggests the opposite @xcite ; see also ref .",
    "however , any bayesian result pivots crucially on the alternative models considered ; the assumptions in ref .",
    "@xcite mean that only isotropic models are considered .",
    "this is a significant omission , since it leaves open the possibility that suboptimal estimates of @xmath7 formed from cut sky data can be reframed as useful measures of anisotropy .",
    "the present work rectifies that omission .",
    "the anomaly is analysed from within harmonic space , and then anisotropic theories which make our cmb realization more probable are considered .",
    "the @xmath4 anomaly is found to be uninformative in the following two senses :    1 .   the trivial maximum likelihood anisotropic gaussian theory for our observed sky where @xmath8 is the observed sky data vector .",
    "] does not lead to substantially better likelihoods for the single statistic @xmath4 ; 2 .",
    "theories constructed specifically to maximize the likelihood of @xmath4 ( ignoring the rest of the information on the sky ) also yield little gain .",
    "these failures arise from the large variance inherent in using a statistic , such as @xmath4 , which is quartic in the data .",
    "overall , then , the present work reinforces the view that the frequentist ` unlikeliness ' of the observed sky must be regarded as a statistical fluke .",
    "some broader results arise from our study .",
    "first , we consider the effect of an anisotropic theory on quadratic maximum likelihood ( qml ) estimates of the power spectrum .",
    "the qml estimators are derived under the ( in this context false ) assumption of isotropy ; despite this , they typically remain superior to pseudo-@xmath2 approaches to power spectrum estimation ( section [ sec : background - notation ] , with detail in appendix [ sec : relat - betw - qml ] ) .",
    "second , we present an extremely fast method for finding the maximum angular momentum direction of a cmb map ( appendix [ sec : rapid - calc - l2_m ] ) .",
    "third , we demonstrate that cut - sky correlation functions can be exactly reproduced from the pseudo-@xmath2 power spectrum ( appendix [ sec : estim - ctheta - s_12 ] ) .",
    "this final result , applicable also for weighted data , has been reported previously @xcite but ignored by recent work ; to our knowledge no proof appears in the existing literature .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec : background - notation ] introduces the necessary background and notation . in section [ sec :",
    "why - mathc - small ] we consider , from a harmonic - space perspective , the origin of the low observed @xmath9 .",
    "anisotropic , gaussian theories which reproduce this result are considered in section [ sec : theories ] , and show that even the best conceivable fit to the observed cmb makes no substantial improvement to the @xmath9 likelihood .",
    "finally , the work is summarized in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "further details and discussion are contained in appendices .",
    "in this section we set out the various definitions needed in our work .",
    "let us start by defining the observed temperature correlation function @xmath3 as @xmath10 where the overbar denotes averaging over all observed line - of - sight vector pairs @xmath11 , @xmath12 satisfying @xmath13 .",
    "we further define @xmath14 where the @xmath15 s are the spherical harmonic coefficients of the temperature field on the observed sky .",
    "a calligraphic @xmath16 thus denotes the observed power , distinguished from the theoretical variances @xmath17 which we regard as defined by the relation @xmath18 for isotropic and anisotropic theories alike .",
    "there is an exact relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath16 , namely @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the legendre polynomials . throughout this paper in our numerical calculations",
    ", we use a finite sum over @xmath21 ; the lower limit discards any contribution from the monopole and dipole , while we verified that the upper limit is high enough for our results to converge .",
    "result ( [ eq : c - full - leg ] ) holds regardless of any theoretical constraints ( such as isotropy ) .",
    "thus the information in the correlation function is identical to that in the @xmath16 s observed on the sky .",
    "if desired , one can define the theoretical correlation function to be the ensemble average of the sky - observed correlation function , @xmath22 .",
    "the purported anomalies relate to the apparent lack of correlations on large angular scales , quantified by @xmath23 this quantity is a measure of the extent to which the temperature from points separated by @xmath5 or more is correlated . rather than evaluate ( [ eq : shalf - definition ] ) directly , it is much faster and numerically more stable to calculate @xmath7 from the quadratic form @xmath24 where , as above , @xmath1 and @xmath25 range from @xmath26 to @xmath27 in our numerical calculations and @xmath28 which may be computed using well - known recursion relations ( _ e.g. _ appendix c.2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if one does not trust information inside a specified mask ( for instance due to suspected galactic contamination ) , one may calculate the correlation function using only the points outside the mask , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a masking function ( equal to @xmath31 or @xmath32 in each pixel ) , so that the angular average denoted by the overbar is over all point pairs ( with @xmath33 ) which lie outside the mask .",
    "this procedure is mathematically identical to calculating the legendre sum over the pseudo-@xmath2 ( pcl ) estimates for the power spectrum ( which we denote @xmath34 ; see appendix [ sec : quadr - estim - some ] for a precise definition ) : @xmath35 while this result has been reported before @xcite , an explicit proof does not appear to exist in the literature , so we provide one in appendix [ sec : estim - ctheta - s_12 ] .",
    "it is clear that , if @xmath36 are any unbiased estimates for @xmath17 , then forming their legendre sum ( [ eq : c - full - leg ] ) yields an unbiased estimator for @xmath37 .",
    "thus if one wishes to find maximum likelihood estimates for @xmath37 on the full sky from cut sky information , by linearity one simply substitutes the maximum likelihood @xmath38 estimates in place of the pcl estimates . for our purposes , the estimates provided by the quadratic maximum likelihood ( qml ) estimator technique @xcite are close enough to the exact maximum likelihood to remove the need for any non - linear techniques @xcite .",
    "there are two somewhat subtle points to be appreciated here .",
    "first , reservations have been expressed about the use of the qml estimator , since it uses prior information on the power spectrum and therefore appears to make strong assumptions about the form of the underlying theory .",
    "@xcite express concern about use of the qml estimator in circumstances where one is questioning the validity of the concordance model .",
    "in fact , this unease turns out to be unwarranted ; one may explicitly show that qml estimates remain superior to pcl estimates  even in cases where the estimates for the covariance matrix are not correct .",
    "let us outline why this should be so .",
    "a full derivation is given in appendix [ sec : relat - betw - qml ] , in which the qml estimator is written entirely within harmonic space .",
    "the estimation procedure can be seen to down - weight high variance modes and up - weight low variance modes before calculating the power spectrum of the weighted cut sky .",
    "the resulting power spectrum is then correctly de - weighted and de - convolved .",
    "the overall effect is to minimize the cross - talk from the mask - induced mode - coupling .",
    "accordingly the qml estimator will be close to optimal in reconstructing skies from any theory where the power in each @xmath1 is close to that predicted in concordance models . since the observed power spectrum is very close to the @xmath39cdm theoretical prediction , any serious candidate theory must satisfy this criterion .",
    "indeed , only if the true theory has a power spectrum closer to flat than to the concordance model will the pcl estimator typically perform better than the qml .",
    "a corollary is that the pcl and qml estimators become identical for a theory with flat power spectrum s are nearly optimal for moderate sky cuts .",
    "such cuts imply that the reconstruction is only sensitive to a finite window @xmath40 , over which the high-@xmath1 @xmath39cdm power spectrum is nearly flat . ] ( equal @xmath2 s ) .",
    "efstathiou et al @xcite make a different rebuttal of the sensitivity - to - assumptions concern by showing that full - sky maps ( albeit band - limited ) can be made from the cut sky data ( see also ref .",
    "the difficulty with full - sky reconstructions is that they rapidly become unstable as the sky cut increases ( unless the data are strictly band - limited , which is not true of the cmb ) .",
    "furthermore they introduce a dependence on the underlying theory so that their conceptual benefits over the qml estimator are not clear ( although , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the sensitivity to the assumed covariance may be rather weak ) .",
    "for this reason we will not consider explicit sky reconstructions further in the present work .",
    "however the second subtlety is that one may not , in fact , want to optimally reconstruct the full sky correlation function .",
    "if we are interested in using a cut sky correlation function _ not _ to remove localized contamination , but instead as a distinct quantity in its own right , the efficiency of the qml estimator at reconstructing the full sky becomes a hinderance .",
    "starting instead from definition ( [ eq : c - cut ] )  the correlation of pixel pairs in a finite region of the sky  gives us a transparent interpretation .",
    "therefore it remains of interest to examine carefully the pcl - derived @xmath41 , not because the qml estimator technique is in doubt as a way of extracting reliable full - sky information , but because the pcl technique explicitly extracts information which is different .",
    "in this section , we discuss the well - established result that @xmath4 is unexpectedly low ( and much smaller than the full sky value ) , and consider the origin of this observation from a harmonic space perspective . known aspects of the full sky realization are found to be behind the result , namely ( a ) the low amplitude , planarity and rough galactic alignment of the quadrupole ; and ( b ) the planarity and alignment of the octupole .",
    "combining equations ( [ eq : shalf - quadratic ] ) and ( [ eq : c - cut - pcl ] ) shows that the value of @xmath4 derived from pixel - pair averages on the cut sky is : @xmath42 it is not clear why various groups have seen differences ( albeit minor ) in @xmath4 measured numerically on the sky and @xmath4 defined by equation ( [ eq : shalf - cut - pcl ] ) , but it probably relates to difficulties in designing stable numerical schemes which estimate @xmath3 directly from pixel pairs .",
    "and the full - sky measured values @xmath16 on the ilc7 map , expressed for ease of viewing as a fraction of the fiducial theoretical best - fit @xmath17 s published by the wmap team @xcite .",
    "the results from a pcl and qml estimator for a @xmath43 azimuthal sky - cut are shown by dots and crosses respectively .",
    "the shaded bands show the expected deviation of the cut - sky from the full - sky values .",
    "the larger , outer band represents the pcl deviation while the smaller , inner band ( with dotted edges ) represents the qml deviation .",
    "the low value of @xmath4 arises because the pcl power spectrum reconstruction for @xmath44 typically falls below , never significantly above , the full sky value.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to understand the origin of the observed @xmath4 value , let us first note that , in a typical realization of the isotropic @xmath39cdm model , the primary driver of the ratio @xmath45 is the ratio @xmath46 .",
    "this reflects the fact that , substituting the theory @xmath2 s in equation ( [ eq : shalf - quadratic ] ) , the dominant contribution is from the term quadratic in @xmath47 .",
    "however , due to the low amplitude of the full sky quadrupole in our particular realization , the @xmath48 mode becomes subdominant in determining @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath49 then gives the dominant contribution on the full sky , so that @xmath50 determines the magnitude of @xmath45 .",
    "now the octupole of the observed realization happens to be somewhat planar ( although , as quantified below , not ` anomalously ' so ) .",
    "its preferred plane is , in turn , very roughly aligned with the galactic plane . when the octupole is masked using one of the standard wmap temperature analysis masks such as kq75y7 ( usable sky fraction @xmath51% ) or kq85y7 ( @xmath52% ) , a significant amount of power in the octupole is hidden due to this approximate alignment , leading the recovered @xmath53 to be an under - estimate of the full sky value .",
    "thus , according to the considerations above , @xmath4 drops sharply in response .",
    "figure [ fig : shalf - vary - cut ] illustrates this further by showing ( top plot , solid line ) the value of @xmath4 derived from the seventh - year wmap @xcite internal linear combination map ( ilc7 ) as the sky coverage of an equatorial , azimuthal mask is increased from @xmath31 to @xmath54 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath55 drops from @xmath56 to @xmath57 ) .",
    "when the sky is unmasked , the pcl and qml power spectrum reconstructions reduce to the full - sky estimate , so that all results agree for the nil cut . for the moment",
    "we will focus on the behaviour of the pcl reconstructions , returning to the qml cases ( dashed and dash - dotted lines ) momentarily .    as described above , the rapid decline in @xmath9 as a function of increasing mask width is largely due to the corresponding decline in @xmath53 ( illustrated in the lowermost right - hand panel of figure [ fig : shalf - vary - cut ] ) , which in turn can be linked to the progressive masking of the planar - concentrated power",
    "( see also the @xmath43 sky - cuts illustrated in the cmb projections on the left of the figure ) .",
    "the known planarity of the quadrupole is also important , in that the cut - sky estimates @xmath58 decline with increasing mask area ( central right - hand panel ) and so do not regain dominance over the octupole contribution .    the described properties of multipoles @xmath59 are not quite enough , on their own , to account for the low @xmath4 . working with an azimuthal mask of @xmath43 , if we use the cut sky values @xmath60 for @xmath59 and the full sky values @xmath61 for @xmath62 , we calculate a value of @xmath63 .",
    "the true cut - sky value for the same mask is @xmath64 .",
    "we can account for this discrepancy by noting that the pcl reconstructions of two other multipoles , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , are also rather low .",
    "the overall situation is illustrated in figure [ fig : c - ratios ] , where we have plotted ( as circles ) the difference between full - sky and cut - sky power spectra ( @xmath67 ) at @xmath68 ; these are calculated from the ilc7 map and scaled by the concordance theory @xmath2 s @xcite .",
    "the differences at @xmath69 are all somewhat outside the @xmath70 variance ( illustrated by the grey jagged band ) is defined as @xmath71 , _ i.e. _ it is the ` cut - induced ' variance introduced in appendix [ sec : expect - vari ] , equation ( [ eq : civ ] ) .",
    "we should note in passing that the variance is close to diagonal ",
    "_ i.e. _ correlations between the estimates for different @xmath1 are small in both pcl and qml cases . ] .",
    "the reason for the shortfall in reconstructed power in @xmath65 and @xmath72 is not immediately clear from inspecting their individual patterns on the sky ( small panels near top left of figure [ fig : shalf - vary - cut ] ) .",
    "only when all the odd multipoles at @xmath73 are summed does the power become visually planar ( see the larger mollweide projection at the bottom left of figure [ fig : shalf - vary - cut ] ) .",
    "thus cancellations between the @xmath74 modes in the polar regions effectively hide power from estimators once the sky is masked .",
    "( we note that even-@xmath1 modes have no effect on the odd-@xmath1 reconstruction and vice versa , since these are decoupled when adopting an equatorially symmetric mask . )",
    "having established the origin of the low @xmath4 , let us turn to the effect of using a qml , rather than pcl , estimator in reconstructing the full sky .",
    "it has been commented elsewhere @xcite that , for kq85y7 masks , the qml estimator reconstructs most of the power in the full sky octupole ; @xmath75 is close to @xmath76 even for the larger kq75y7 mask .",
    "we have reproduced these results ; qml outputs are plotted as crosses in the panels of figures [ fig : shalf - vary - cut ] and [ fig : c - ratios ] . as discussed above ( section [ sec : background - notation ] ) , the qml estimator re - weights its input maps to extract full - sky information as efficiently as possible ;",
    "hence the improvement is not surprising .",
    "recall that , even when considering anisotropic theories , the qml estimates for the full sky are expected to be superior ( this is further reinforced in section [ sec : theories ] below ) .    however , the qml estimator s ability to make an efficient recovery of our full sky results does depend on the shape of the mask . for an azimuthal mask covering a sky fraction",
    "@xmath77 , even the qml estimator starts to underestimate the power on the full sky ( illustrated by the dotted lines in the right panels of figure [ fig : shalf - vary - cut ] ; the lower panel shows that the falling @xmath75 tracks a drop in the power of the reconstructed octupole @xmath78 ) .",
    "these results show that , if the power is sufficiently localized within the mask , it can not be reconstructed by any technique .",
    "this interpretation of the results is confirmed by applying an azimuthal mask in the plane ( as defined below ) of the octupole ( dotted lines in all panels of figure [ fig : shalf - vary - cut ] ) .",
    "the octupole plane is defined by rotating the map until the `` angular momentum dispersion '' statistic @xcite for quantifying the planarity of multipole @xmath1 is maximized : @xmath79 ( this maximization is achieved using a fast method described in appendix [ sec : rapid - calc - l2_m ] . ) now the octupole is masked from the map very efficiently , and @xmath78 drops sharply as a consequence . in response , @xmath75 becomes a severe under - estimate , at large sky cuts becoming even worse than the galactic azimuthal - masked pcl estimator .      the preceding material has shown that the small measured value of @xmath4 is attributable to a series of somewhat unlikely aspects of the observed realization .",
    "we now recap and discuss briefly the frequentist statistical significance of @xmath4 .",
    "the primary contribution is the low ( @xmath80 ) quadrupole amplitude ( with a @xmath6-value of @xmath81 given the best - fit power spectrum ) .",
    "the planarity of the octupole can be assessed by considering the rotation - maximized value of eq .",
    "( [ eq : angmom - stat ] ) , which on the ilc7 map is 0.926 .",
    "the @xmath6-value computed from 10,000 isotropic realizations for observing @xmath82 is @xmath83 15% , _",
    "i.e. _ our realization is not particularly unusual .",
    "the approximate alignment of this somewhat planar octupole with the galactic cuts typically used in cmb data analyses can reasonably be regarded as purely coincidental ( @xmath6-value @xmath84 ) .",
    "a consistent picture is found from assessing figure [ fig : c - ratios ] , in which the @xmath85 pcl reconstruction deviates from the mean by about @xmath86 .",
    "similarly the shortfall of pcl - reconstructed power in the @xmath65 and @xmath72 modes is a fluctuation of around @xmath87 .",
    "none of these observations on their own look particularly unusual ; the statistical anomaly arises instead because _ all _ of the low-@xmath1 pcl estimates are low . despite its suboptimal nature the pcl estimator is unbiased , and the reconstructions at different @xmath1 s are only weakly correlated , so one would have expected as many over- as under - estimates .",
    "the frequentist significance of the @xmath4 result is connected , then , to a series of coincident minor anomalies in our realization .",
    "only when combined in a specific way do these observations raise frequentist alarm .",
    "of course , this simply shows that we have found a way to ` factor ' the low @xmath6-value of @xmath4 , which does not by itself determine whether the anomaly might point to theories beyond the concordance model .",
    "therefore in the next section , we consider the feasibility of finding theories which are statistically preferred to the concordance theory in a bayesian comparison of @xmath4 .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that the low observed @xmath88 can be attributed to the fortuitous alignment of power in the @xmath89 and @xmath72 modes of the cmb ( along with the planarity , and small full - sky amplitude , of the quadrupole ) .",
    "broadly , one can imagine three distinct ways in which the small observed cut - sky power in the @xmath89 and @xmath72 modes could look less anomalous in an alternative theory :    1 .",
    "the @xmath34 estimates could turn out to be biased in the ensemble mean of the true theory ; 2 .",
    "the @xmath34 estimates could have a larger variance in the ensemble of the true theory , making the departures from the mean less significant ; 3 .   the true theory could correlate @xmath34 estimates so that the likelihood of small cut - sky power in @xmath90 is greater once the small cut - sky power in @xmath85 is known",
    ".    our main focus in what follows will be on ( 1 ) ; possibilities ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) will be mentioned where relevant .",
    "given a true covariance matrix @xmath91 related to the concordance isotropic theory by @xmath92 , one may explicitly calculate the bias , @xmath93 and the variance @xmath94 where the false covariance matrix @xmath95 is used in constructing estimators , but the true covariance matrix @xmath91 is employed in taking the final ensemble average . for algebraic expressions the reader",
    "is referred to appendix [ sec : expect - vari ] .    to gain a feel for",
    "how alternative theories can influence the recovered power spectrum on the cut sky , let us consider the following specific cases .    1 .   _ galactic contamination _ , _",
    "i.e. _ residual errors in the galactic signal subtraction .",
    "this is modelled by creating a template map of possible errors , taking @xmath96 of the difference of the wmap7 ilc map with the v - band map ( after smoothing to a common resolution of @xmath97 ) .",
    "the map gives us a rough handle on the form of the residual contamination to be expected ( albeit with an unknown amplitude ) . in the ensemble ,",
    "the template map is simply added to the observed cmb sky , yielding equivalent results to a theory with anisotropic gaussian correction @xmath98 , where @xmath99 represents the spherical harmonic coefficients of the contamination map .",
    "it has already been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this kind of contamination can not improve the likelihood of @xmath4 , but the model remains helpful for our discussion below . 2 .   _",
    "bianchi vii@xmath100 template_. using the algorithms of refs .",
    "@xcite we calculate a temperature anisotropy template for the bianchi vii@xmath100 vector mode case with an amplitude of @xmath101k according to the best - fit parameters of ref . @xcite . in the ensemble",
    "this is added to the concordance cmb as with the templates considered above .",
    "physically , such a setup can be motivated by the existence of anisotropic bianchi modes which are well behaved at the initial singularity , although such models are fine - tuned .",
    "quadrupolar modulation_. a strong quadrupolar modulation to @xmath102 while the mask couples @xmath1 to @xmath103 . a different quadrupolar anisotropy , that of the inferred primordial power spectrum , has also been reported @xcite",
    "however , hanson et al . @xcite",
    "have identified wmap beam asymmetries as the origin of this unconnected effect .",
    "] of the temperature field is known to reproduce the co - planarity of quadrupole and octupole @xcite .",
    "the modulation is required to have a very large amplitude , yet be confined to low multipoles .",
    "@xcite discuss how any early universe model of such a modulation must be carefully tuned in harmonic space to avoid the leakage of modulated power to high multipoles through projection effects .",
    "we approximate these considerations by modulating only the quadrupole and octupole of isotropic realizations . since a quadrupolar modulation of a multipole @xmath1 couples power to @xmath104 , on the full sky our modulation only has an effect on multipoles @xmath105 .",
    "_ picture _ and _ designer _ theories .",
    "these are specific theories designed to investigate the best possible statistical gains to be made from anisotropic theories over the concordance case .",
    "we will describe them in detail in section [ sec : designer - theory - main ] , below .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : theories - biases - and - variances ] exhibits the biases induced by each of these theories [ defined by equation ( [ eq : aniso - bias ] ) ] ; the right hand panel shows the diagonal part of the variance [ defined by equation ( [ eq : aniso - variance ] ) ] . in both panels ,",
    "the results from the pcl estimators are plotted as solid lines , while the qml results are shown by dashed lines .",
    "the sky cut imposed for these calculations is a @xmath43 galactic azimuthal mask .    in the first case , that of galactic contamination , the ` bias ' reflects the added power from the galaxy , visible in the full sky @xmath61 s but naturally invisible to reconstructions made from the cut sky ( in which the galaxy is masked away )",
    "both the pcl and qml estimators therefore become equally ` biased ' , but this is , in fact , a desirable feature : they are rejecting the contamination .",
    "note that the zig - zag pattern in the bias arises from the rough equatorial symmetry of the galaxy , which results in a much stronger coupling to even , rather than odd , @xmath1 s . on the other hand",
    "the zig - zag in the biases actually observed ( figure [ fig : c - ratios ] ) is larger at odd , rather than even , @xmath1 s .",
    "finally , the apparent biases and extra variance of spatially localized contamination tends to grow towards high @xmath1 as a fraction of the full sky power , whereas the observed discrepancies are confined to low @xmath1 .",
    "the second case ( bianchi contamination ) is similar in that it adds a template to the concordance covariance ; but because the power is not localized within the mask , it is now visible even on the cut - sky . as expected from our earlier considerations , the qml estimator in this regime reconstructs the full sky @xmath61 power with a smaller bias and variance than the pcl case .",
    "the increased variance ( of order @xmath43 of the cosmic variance ) is more significant than the bias ( of order @xmath106 of the power spectrum ) .",
    "this can be understood by noting that , since the bianchi signal has a small rms power of @xmath107k@xmath108 , the individual elements of the template covariance contribution @xmath109 are much smaller than the elements of the concordance covariance matrix @xmath95 . expanding an expression for the variance ( [ eq : estimator - variance ] ) highlights the existence of cross - terms in @xmath95 and @xmath109 ; it is these leading order contributions which give the larger variance .",
    "let us now turn away from additive modifications to the concordance theory , and instead discuss the quadrupolar modulation .",
    "when analysed on the cut sky , the power at low multipoles is hidden from the pcl estimator ( but less so from the qml estimator ) , leading to a negative bias .",
    "the modulation also couples @xmath110 , creating power on the full sky in @xmath111 ; this accounts for the spike at these multipoles in the variance of the estimators .",
    "the extra power is further spread to higher @xmath1 by mode - coupling resulting from the masking operation .",
    "the result is that the pcl estimator over - estimates power in multipoles @xmath112 ; note that , because the power spectrum is rapidly decreasing , a small leakage of power to high @xmath1 from the low multipoles can result in a substantial bias .",
    "once again the qml estimator fares better , more efficiently confining the contamination to low @xmath1 .",
    "the quadrupolar modulation behaves qualitatively as expected , hiding power at low @xmath1 ; this is the right sort of effect to reproduce the low @xmath4 and therefore produces a small increase in the likelihood of the observed value .",
    "however , figure [ fig : theories - biases - and - variances ] shows that the biases from this theory are rather small .",
    "therefore , rather than focus on this model , we can go one stage further and consider tuning gaussian models to fit the value of @xmath4 as closely as possible .",
    "these theories are less transparent in their physical meaning , but are guaranteed to give a better fit to the observed properties of the sky .",
    "consider the theory which exactly matches the observed cmb ; it has covariance matrix @xmath113 where @xmath8 represents the observed ilc @xmath15 s .",
    "because @xmath91 has zero variance in any direction orthogonal to the observed data , it has an infinite likelihood ( or , more correctly , a likelihood bounded from above only by noise in the experiment ) .",
    "the ensemble for this theory is a series of pictures of our own cmb sky ( represented here by the ilc map ) , scaled by a gaussian random amplitude of unit variance .",
    "consequently the biases exactly match the values of @xmath114 for our observed sky ( see figure [ fig : theories - biases - and - variances ] ) .",
    "however , because there is only one mode ( the amplitude scaling of the entire sky ) , the variances become extremely large . to build intuition ,",
    "consider the cosmic variance of the concordance model , in which the variance on @xmath61 decreases as @xmath115 .",
    "this arises solely because of the additional modes available at increasing @xmath1 ; in the picture theory all modes are perfectly correlated , so the cosmic variance does not decline in this way .    in spite of the divergently large likelihood for the picture theory",
    ", the variance means that our observed value of @xmath4 has a finite likelihood which can be calculated by monte carlo simulation of the ensemble . in figure",
    "[ fig : shalf - likelihoods ] we plot the log likelihood for the concordance @xmath39cdm model ( solid line ) , the picture theory ( dash - dotted line ) and the designer theory ( dashed line ) , the last of which we will return to momentarily .",
    "the improvement in the log likelihood of @xmath4 for the picture model ( over the isotropic concordance case ) is @xmath116 .",
    "this disappointingly modest improvement can be seen to result from the large cosmic variance in a theory with only one degree of freedom : while it peaks near the observed value , the @xmath4 likelihood function for the picture theory is extremely broad .",
    "the broadness in turn impacts upon the peak value because the likelihood must be normalized to one .",
    "we have examined the picture theory in which the likelihood of our own observed cmb is , by design , divergently large .",
    "the @xmath4 likelihood was shown to barely favour the theory because the variance on this value is so large . in this section",
    "we search for a theory with similar properties to the observed sky , but allow power to be spread through many more modes , so that the variance in high - order statistics such as @xmath4 is better controlled .",
    "compared between three theories : the isotropic concordance theory ( solid line ) , the ` designer ' theory ( dashed line ) and ` picture ' ( dash - dotted line ) theory .",
    "the latter two are specifically designed to reproduce low @xmath4 .",
    "the improvement in the log likelihood over the concordance cases are respectively 4.2 and 3.7 , which are very small improvements given the fine - tuning involved .",
    "since these theories should produce the greatest possible gains in likelihood , the value of the observed @xmath4 statistic is not a strong objection to the concordance theory.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    a full explanation of the mathematical construction is given in appendix [ sec : designer - theories ] .",
    "our search is over all positive definite covariance matrices @xmath91 , corresponding to all gaussian theories with zero mean ( @xmath117 ) , subject to two sets of constraints .",
    "firstly , the covariance matrix is required to have full - sky theory @xmath2 s [ defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : theory - cl - definition ] ) ] equal to the observed ilc values ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "secondly , the pcl estimator applied to the theory on the @xmath43 azimuthally masked sky is required to find zero power in @xmath119 and @xmath72 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath120 at these @xmath1 s ) . in order to satisfy these results simultaneously , our technique naturally introduces anisotropic correlations between different multipoles .",
    "substantial freedom remains , which we use to minimize the cosmic variance of the final theory ( see appendix [ sec : designer - theories ] ) .",
    "the freedom is truncated at @xmath121 ; we adopted the concordance covariance for all @xmath122 , but verified that our conclusions are insensitive to this choice .",
    "the cmb projection labelled ` designer ' in figure [ fig : theories - biases - and - variances ] illustrates an actual realization from this model ( although only the @xmath89 and @xmath72 modes are plotted ) .",
    "one can see that the theory is very efficient at localizing power in modes confined within our specified @xmath43 mask ( while keeping the full sky power spectrum to the specified values ) .",
    "the bias panel for this theory shows that , accordingly , no power is detected by the cut - sky pcl estimator in @xmath89 and @xmath72 .",
    "( the plot shows that some of the biases are actually smaller than @xmath123 , which is as expected since @xmath124 at the corresponding multipoles . ) at low @xmath1 , the variance on the @xmath38 s is smaller than for the concordance model ( @xmath125 ) , because the reconstructed power in these modes remains close to zero in all realizations .",
    "for @xmath126 , there is a spike of larger variance arising from the mask - induced contamination similar to that described for the modulation model . at large @xmath1",
    ", the variance tends to the standard concordance variance for the estimators ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "once again , the qml estimator performs better in minimizing both bias and variance compared to the pcl case at nearly all @xmath1 .",
    "we can now return to figure [ fig : shalf - likelihoods ] which displays , as a dashed curve , the likelihoods for our designer theory .",
    "we described above how the power localization at low @xmath1 favours a low @xmath4 ; accordingly the peak likelihood ( at @xmath128 ) is considerably smaller than the equivalent value for the concordance theory ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "however , despite being minimized by spreading power through more degrees of freedom , the variance of the designer @xmath4 remains large and consequently the improvement in likelihood is modest ( @xmath130 ) despite the dramatic increase in the number of degrees of freedom needed to construct this theory .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : shalf - likelihoods ] that to obtain significant gains in likelihood for @xmath4 , one needs to achieve far smaller cosmic variance on @xmath4 .",
    "but the designer theory plausibly gives near the smallest possible variance on this quantity .",
    "in particular , appendix [ sec : designer - theories ] derives a minimum bound on the variance of @xmath4 . the lower bound",
    "can be understood as arising from a suitable isotropic limit ( which is unattainable in practice , but provides a provable lower limit for attainable theories ) ; isotropic theories minimize the cosmic variance for a given power spectrum , because they maximize the number of independent modes and spread power through these modes as evenly as possible .",
    "the lower bound calculated from the appropriate isotropic test - case is @xmath131 , compared with the variance on the designer theory of @xmath132 .",
    "thus the designer theory detailed in this section almost saturates the variance limit ; we may be confident that no gaussian theory can have a significantly more peaked likelihood .",
    "the two theories we have discussed in the preceding two sections ( the first giving an infinite likelihood for the observed sky ; the second tuned as far as we can to give a large likelihood for the single value @xmath4 ) strongly suggest that no anisotropic gaussian theory can improve the likelihood of the observed @xmath4 by more than@xmath133 . because of the careful fine - tuning of these models , they form a plausible upper bound for the statistical gain available",
    ".    how can we interpret this very modest likelihood gain ? from a bayesian perspective , correlations between the primary temperature ( from the high-@xmath134 last scattering surface ) and the integrated sachs - wolfe signal ( from local structure ) are implied in any model aligning low-@xmath1 power @xcite .",
    "therefore any realistic physical prior probability is very small relative to the isotropic @xmath39cdm cosmogony ; the posterior probability ratios will still vastly favour the latter theory .",
    "an alternative argument is as follows .",
    "up to @xmath135 ( and excluding monopole and dipole ) , the anisotropic theory has approximately @xmath136 degrees of freedom compared to the isotropic case with @xmath137 degrees of freedom .",
    "thus the improvement in log likelihood per degree of freedom is of order @xmath138 .",
    "while this is not a strictly bayesian interpretation , it does suggest that our statistical gain has been achieved only with enormous fine - tuning .",
    "both of these lines of reasoning suggest strongly that the observed value of @xmath4 can never constitute strong evidence in favour of any gaussian theory posited as an alternative to @xmath39cdm .",
    "one escape route from this result is to consider , rather than the absolute value of @xmath4 , the ratio @xmath139 . in the case of the picture theory , for instance ,",
    "one then has an infinite likelihood for the observed value of the ratio ( because the one available random degree of freedom  the amplitude  cancels between numerator and denominator ) .",
    "this immediately demonstrates that there is no upper bound to the likelihood gain for such a statistic .",
    "we would suggest , however , that the existence of an upper bound for the original statistic , @xmath4 , is an attractive property ",
    "precisely because it allows for an understanding of the bayesian theoretical improvements available without detailed physical modelling . the most convincing way to show that the observed sky is anomalous would therefore be to find a statistic encapsulating the planarity and correlation of power which has large , but not trivially infinite , likelihood gains available .",
    "starting from the results of section [ sec : why - mathc - small ] , such a statistic might be developed from physical considerations on the full sky .",
    "there is a classic difficulty in understanding large and complex datasets such as those produced by wmap and , in the future , _ planck _ : they contain so much information that statistical anomalies can be found without any difficulty .",
    "we have taken as an example the purported anomalous aspects of the angular correlation function .",
    "some previous work claims that , after considering these anomalies , the entire cosmological paradigm is to be doubted @xcite ; other authors claim that apparent anomalies can be dismissed as the product of _ a posteriori _",
    "analysis @xcite .",
    "yet _ a posteriori _ reasoning must be allowed in science , since otherwise we would rarely , if ever , recognize failings of our existing knowledge .",
    "the contrary statistical claims relating to @xmath9 are reconciled by appreciating that , without an alternative theory to test against , there is no unambiguous significance to any anomaly .",
    "we have therefore presented an alternative approach to this puzzle : we examined the origin of the low @xmath9 in harmonic space , and then attempted to find theories that reproduce the required patterns .    in the process",
    "we noted that the cut - sky correlation function contains identical information to the pcl power spectrum estimates .",
    "we therefore used the pcl estimates for the majority of our results , but also demonstrated that the standard qml techniques provide more reliable reconstructions of the full sky , even when anisotropy is suspected .",
    "we informed our intuition about the behaviour of the estimators by considering simple anisotropic modifications to the concordance models ( contamination , bianchi and quadrupolar modulation theories ) .",
    "this showed explicitly that the qml estimator biases introduced by anisotropic theories were smaller than or comparable to the pcl case .",
    "then , by attempting to construct anisotropic gaussian theories which improve the likelihood of the low @xmath4 , we demonstrated that no significant gains in likelihood for this single statistic are available .",
    "since there is no suggestion in the observed sky that the underlying ensemble is significantly non - gaussian @xcite , it is implausible that post - gaussian corrections would substantially change our results .",
    "we therefore conclude that the @xmath4 anomaly is not likely to point to new physics .",
    "if it does have any meaning , the @xmath4 anomaly ( and the underlying shortfall of power seen by pcl estimators ) does not indicate a vanishing large - scale correlation function , but rather is related to alignments of low-@xmath1 power on the full sky ( section [ sec : why - mathc - small ] ) .",
    "it is likely that full - sky statistics can be constructed which capture these unexpected correlations better than @xmath4  and these could evade our likelihood limits .",
    "however , we argued that more trivial modifications ( such as taking the ratio @xmath139 ) which sidestep our constraint by attaining an infinite likelihood under the ` picture ' theory ( @xmath140 ) are not helpful ; see section [ sec : summary - discussion ] .",
    "in other words it is highly desirable to choose statistics , such as @xmath4 , that do allow for a finite limit to be placed on the bayesian statistical gain available under a wide class of alternative straw - man models .",
    "considering the magnitude of that limit is then , in our view , a plausible way to probe the significance of _ a posteriori _ anomalies .",

    "it can only do this by having prior information about the shape of the spectrum in the region of the @xmath1 estimate under construction .",

    "the weights are flatter for the qml estimator ( dashed line ) than for the pcl estimator ( thick solid line ) .",
    "it is actually a fortuitous result of the shape of the concordance power spectrum that this is true ; otherwise the reliability of the qml estimator would depend more sensitively on the underlying anisotropic theory .",
    "we now demonstrate the crucial result that the pcl and qml estimators become identical for a flat power spectrum .",
    "the covariance matrix is then proportional to the identity , @xmath186 , so that the qml reconstruction matrices reduce to    @xmath187    where the final expression for @xmath188 is obtained by expanding the masked expressions ( @xmath189 ) and using the condition @xmath146 obtained in section [ sec : cut - sky ] .    by rewriting equation ( [ eq :",
    "c - ell - est ] ) as @xmath190 , it follows that the @xmath155 appearing in any statistical expression must arise in the combination @xmath191 .",
    "this means that one can , without loss of generality , dispense with the explicit masking @xmath145 matrices in expression ( [ eq : qml - becomes - pcl ] ) , again relying on the identity @xmath192 . finally , the @xmath193 factors in equations ( [ eq : qml - becomes - pcl ] ) and ( [ eq : quasi - pcl - m ] ) may be mutually cancelled , since @xmath150 appears only in the expression for @xmath194 .",
    "thus we may write @xmath195 where the @xmath83 symbol should be read as ` yields identical estimates to '  _ i.e. _ it denotes an equivalence relation , not an approximate equality of the matrix elements . to verify this ,",
    "compare the above with eqs ( [ eq : pcl - kernel ] ,  [ eq : pcl - debiaser ] ) , noting that the missing factors of @xmath170 are conventional normalizations which exactly cancel between the two lines .",
    "this demonstrates that , if @xmath196 , qml estimates are identical to pcl estimates .",
    "the result does not rely on any assumptions about the galactic cut being small .",
    "however , for a small galactic cut , the mask operation @xmath145 acquires a narrow banded structure at high-@xmath1 such that each @xmath1 is effectively coupled only to a finite range of @xmath25 from @xmath197 to @xmath198 .",
    "thus , even though the concordance covariance matrix is not proportional to the identity , at high @xmath1 its relevant , local structure can be adequately approximated as such .",
    "this demonstrates the equivalence of the qml and pcl estimators in this regime .    to understand the difference between qml and pcl estimators one can reverse the argument above [ _ i.e. _ one replaces @xmath199 by @xmath200 in equation ( [ eq : pcl - kernel ] ) then compares with equation ( [ eq : qml - kernel ] ) , finding the latter simply pre - weights the data ] .",
    "it follows from all this that the qml estimator can , roughly speaking , be expected to remain superior to the pcl estimator for any theory compatible with our sky . to demonstrate this explicitly ,",
    "we draw random covariance matrices with power spectrum equal to that of the observed ilc , but taking a random distribution of power between different @xmath182 modes . explicit calculations for each of these theories show that the qml biases ( [ eq : estimator - bias ] ) and variances ( [ eq : estimator - variance ] ) are significantly smaller than their pcl counterparts .",
    "a specific illustration is given in figure [ fig : sim - bias ] , where we plot a histogram of the biases on @xmath201 ( solid line ) and @xmath202 ( dashed line ) for @xmath203 random theories .",
    "the pcl estimator has a significantly broader distribution of biases than the qml estimator , showing that the qml technique typically produces more reliable estimates of the full sky power .    in conclusion , for any anisotropic theory",
    "which is compatible with our observed sky , estimates for the power spectrum formed using the qml technique ( despite being derived assuming isotropy ) are expected to be superior to pcl estimates for the same quantity .     random anisotropic theories , the bias on the cut - sky power spectrum estimates ( here illustrated for @xmath65 with a 20% azimuthal mask ) . the width of the curves show that , for a given theory , the qml estimator ( dashed curve ) is typically significantly less biased than the pcl estimator ( solid curve ) .",
    "similar results hold at other @xmath1 s and for the extra variance induced by the anisotropy .",

    "in this section we demonstrate that the pixel - based cut - sky correlation function , @xmath205 where @xmath206 , is identical to the pcl - based estimator @xmath207 this has been stated before @xcite and is implicit in other works @xcite , but an explicit demonstration has not , to our knowledge , appeared in the literature .",
    "the argument holds for any weighting function @xmath30 : if @xmath208 takes values other than @xmath31 and @xmath32 the harmonic - space matrix @xmath145 [ still defined by equation ( [ eq : mask - matrix - def ] ) ] is no longer idempotent , but no part of the proof below is affected by such a change .    equation ( [ eq : c - cut - appendix ] ) may be expressed @xmath209 where @xmath210 , equal to the denominator of ( [ eq : c - cut - appendix ] ) , is a normalizing function dependent only on @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath211 is the power spectrum of the masked ( or weighted ) sky , @xmath212 where @xmath213 is defined by equation ( [ eq : pcl - debiaser ] ) .",
    "a power spectrum can be calculated from @xmath214 : @xmath215 where the matrix @xmath216 depends only on @xmath210 ( and hence only on the sky cut , not any aspects of the theory or realization ) .",
    "if we temporarily consider a theory which is isotropic , we have @xmath217 and hence , by linearity , @xmath218 .",
    "but then , comparing with expression ( [ eq : cl - cut - cl - pcl - relation ] ) , the only possibility is that the matrix @xmath219 is the inverse of the matrix @xmath220  in other words that @xmath221 we reiterate that neither @xmath222 nor @xmath213 depend on either the underlying theory nor the particular realization in hand , and therefore this result is independent of isotropy .",
    "finally , one inverts the legendre transform to gain the desired result , @xmath223 valid for any theory .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath4 derived from expression ( [ eq : shalf - cut - pcl ] ) must be mathematically equivalent to pixel - based estimates .",
    "the above proof depends on the invertibility of @xmath224 .",
    "it is well known that this matrix is not invertible for all choices of sky - cut ( although for all masks considered in the present work we have found it to be well - behaved ) . however , in any limit where @xmath225 , one must have @xmath226 . according to definition ( [ eq : t - matrix ] ) , this will occur if and only if @xmath227 for some @xmath228  in other words if and only if the cut sky contains , in the limit , no two points separated by certain values of @xmath228 .",
    "it follows that , whenever the entire correlation function can be recovered from the cut sky , the pcl estimates can be made and the relationship proved above holds .",
    "we should note in passing that , because @xmath7 is quadratic in the @xmath16 s , its expectation value does not follow simply by replacing the @xmath16 s with the @xmath2 s in eq .",
    "( [ eq : shalf - quadratic ] ) ; rather , the full sky expectation value reads for the concordance theory @xmath229 the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : shalf - theory ] ) contributes very significantly to the expectation value , which breaks down term - by - term as @xmath230 for the wmap5 best fit @xmath2 s .",
    "this means that ( for instance ) the comparison of our full sky with the theory values in table  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite is not strictly appropriate ; with the cosmic variance term included , the observed @xmath7 statistic is made to look even more discrepant with the theory .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath4 calculated directly from the cut sky @xmath36 is also increased , for similar reasons , but by a larger amount corresponding to the larger variance on the cut sky power spectrum estimates : @xmath231 where @xmath166 is the variance of the @xmath38 s , given by expression ( [ eq : estimator - variance ] ) .",
    "this biases cut - sky @xmath7 values to be higher than their full - sky counterparts , for instance by @xmath232 for pcl and @xmath233 for qml reconstructions with a @xmath43 azimuthal sky cut .    at face value ,",
    "such biases make it more surprising that the measured @xmath7 should be so small and @xmath4 even smaller .",
    "however , the standard deviation of @xmath4 is very large ( @xmath234 ) so that the biases do not have a significant impact on the frequentist significances .",
    "furthermore , and regardless of the magnitude of the biasing , the monte carlo techniques used in refs @xcite and @xcite are anyway valid ( they automatically take the biasing into account ) .",
    "we have therefore included the discussion above only for pedagogical interest .",
    "in section [ sec : designer - theory - main ] we used a theory with covariance matrix @xmath91 determined by two considerations :    1 .",
    "the full sky power spectrum is given by @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the observed power spectrum on the full - sky ilc map ; 2 .",
    "the cut sky power spectrum ( pcl estimator using a @xmath43 azimuthal cut ) is biased , _",

    "both constraints are linear in the full sky covariance matrix [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cell - from - cov ] ) and ( [ eq : estimator - bias ] ) ] .",
    "while one can construct a matrix @xmath91 satisfying these constraints using straight - forward linear algebra , the result is not unique and furthermore it is hard to enforce that @xmath91 be positive definite ( as it must be to define a valid covariance matrix ) .",
    "therefore we adopted the package cvxopt to find a suitable theory @xmath91 within the set of positive definite matrices .",
    "cvxopt allows us to find a unique solution by minimizing any convex quadratic form , for which we chose the function @xmath240 .",
    "the choice at first appears arbitrary ; but schematically , by considering the eigenvalues of @xmath91 , one can imagine that minimizing @xmath240 tries to ` equalize power between as many modes as possible ' .",
    "this in turn is motivated by our attempt to minimize the cosmic variance on @xmath4 , leading to the most peaked likelihood function ( and hence best possible likelihood gains over the concordance theory ) .",
    "these statements can be made somewhat more mathematically concrete , but we did not find a full proof that minimizing @xmath240 minimizes the cosmic variance of @xmath4 . instead , section [ sec : designer - theory - main ] gave a strict lower bound on the variance of @xmath4 , and stated that our theory comes close to saturating this limit .",
    "the remainder of the present appendix explains the origin of such a variance floor .",

    "we consider the case where this is true for all @xmath250 , @xmath251 ( @xmath246 ) , but the ideas generalize straight - forwardly to the case with only limited numbers of non - zero off - diagonal terms .",
    "the most general solution is @xmath252 where the @xmath253 are symmetric matrices which satisfy @xmath254 ( off - diagonal ) and @xmath255 the @xmath253 may be found numerically using a singular value decomposition technique .",
    "let us consider whether a physical ( positive definite ) solution to equations ( [ eq : violating - variance ] ) and ( [ eq : violating - variance - constraint ] ) exists .",
    "a necessary condition is that @xmath256 this condition is violated by equation ( [ eq : violating - variance ] ) with @xmath257 , but can a suitable choice of @xmath258 remove the violation ?",
    "there are far fewer @xmath259 matrices than degrees of freedom in @xmath243 , so that one would need a numerical coincidence to be able to remove the violation simultaneously at all @xmath1 .",
    "we verified computationally that , for our choice of @xmath2 , this is indeed not possible .",
    "now when the gaussian simplification is abandoned , expression ( [ eq : shalfvar - gaussian ] ) picks up extra terms of the form @xmath260 one may verify that with these terms , equation ( [ eq : isotropic - min - var ] ) remains a local minimum of the @xmath7 variance .",
    "since there are no other valid local minima in the gaussian approximation , we should not expect to find new local minima appearing in the non - gaussian case ( the simplification modifies only the skewness , not the width , of the likelihood ) .",
    "a full analytic calculation is prohibitive , but the numerical results quoted in the main paper use the full , non - gaussian likelihood .",
    "now let us consider the cut sky case .",
    "the de - biased pcl estimates @xmath261 are related to the power spectrum of the cut sky @xmath262 by @xmath263 for the matrix @xmath150 defined by equation ( [ eq : pcl - debiaser ] ) .",
    "( the ` pcl ' superscript is dropped for concision . ) because of the exact relation @xmath264 ( see appendix [ sec : estim - ctheta - s_12 ] ) we may define @xmath265 so that equation ( [ eq : shalf - cut - lengthy ] ) simplifies to @xmath266 the cut - sky reasoning then follows through exactly as for the full - sky case , except with @xmath267 and @xmath91 replaced by @xmath268 and @xmath175 respectively . for the lower bound theory one obtains @xmath269 clearly this ignores the implicit restrictions on @xmath175 arising from its status as a cut - sky , rather than full - sky , covariance matrix .",
    "( specifically , a valid @xmath175 must live in the cut - sky subspace so that @xmath270 .",

    "therefore our test theory still gives a lower bound for the set of valid theories .    to actually calculate the lower bound we draw 20000 sets of @xmath272 s according to the covariance matrix ( [ eq : unobtainable - cutsky - cov ] ) and , for each , calculate the power spectrum @xmath211 and",
    "hence @xmath4 according to equation ( [ eq : shalf - cut - from - cutsky ] ) . calculating the variance on this random sample leads to the numerical lower limit quoted in section [ sec : designer - theory - main ] .",
    "finally note that , because @xmath150 is almost diagonal , our monte carlo results are almost equivalent to those obtained by calculating @xmath7 in an isotropic theory satisfying @xmath273 this is the justification for our intuitive explanation that the lower bound on the variance of @xmath4 is given by the variance of @xmath7 in an isotropic , full - sky theory with power spectrum equal to the cut - sky power spectrum of the designer theory .",
    "there is a hidden numerical pitfall in the harmonic - space masking operation as defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mask - matrix - def ] ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath145 is not band - limited , which means that truncating at finite @xmath1 produces cut - sky vectors @xmath274 which retain some information about the data inside the cut .",
    "this garbled information is visible in maps as low - amplitude ringing around the edges of the cut .",
    "the qml estimator , in particular , is very efficient at regenerating the full sky from this trace of unwanted information .",
    "we investigated two methods of mitigating this problem , both of which generated results in good agreement with pixel space techniques .",
    "the first is heuristic , simply smoothing the input ( full sky ) and output ( cut sky ) maps to angular scales larger than @xmath275 .",
    "the second , which we adopted for our final results , is to use an eigenvector decomposition . for a specified sky fraction @xmath276",
    ", we calculate @xmath145 to finite @xmath277 and find its eigenvalues and vectors .",
    "we then replace the smallest eigenvalues ( specifically , a fraction @xmath276 of the eigenvalues ) by zero and all other eigenvalues by one .",
    "the final operation is then guaranteed to be idempotent ( unlike the ad hoc smoothing approach ) and also discards exactly the right fraction of information from the input map .",
    "visually , we found the maps produced looked almost identical to those masked in pixel space .",
    "as commented above , we verified that the final estimator results produced from a harmonic - space analysis were closely compatible with those produced from a pixel space analysis .",
    "the latter are slow and cumbersome [ they can not take advantage of simplification ( [ eq : azimuthal - simplification ] ) ] , but do not suffer from the band - limitation problem and therefore serve as a useful point of comparison .",

    "frequentist anomalies are then reported if the sky - measured maximum values of @xmath280 have small @xmath6-values according to monte carlo simulations of statistically isotropic skies  or if the maximizing directions for two different @xmath1 s are coincident",
