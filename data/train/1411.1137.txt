    "hardness intensity diagram ( hid ) of a typical z source include three branches , the horizontal branch ( hb ) , the normal branch ( nb ) , and the flare branch ( fb ) . depending on further details about the shape and orientation of these branches , the z sources were further classified into the  cyg - like \" z sources and the  sco - like \" z sources .",
    "three distinct types of lfqpos were observed in the fourier power density spectra of z sources : horizontal branch oscillation ( hbo ) with centroid frequency @xmath6",
    "hz , normal branch oscillation ( nbo ) with centriod frequency @xmath7 hz , and flare branch oscillation ( fbo ) with centroid frequency @xmath8 hz .",
    "atoll sources also show @xmath9 hz lfqpos .",
    "in the case of transient bh - lmxbs , lfqpos have been sorted into type a , b and c qpos ( see @xcite ) .",
    "ns - lmxbs and bh - lmxbs have plenty of resemblances in their x - ray power spectra @xcite , in particular at high frequencies @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the properties of type a , b and c lfqpos in bh - lmxbs are similar to that of fbos , nbos , and hbos in z sources , respectively . a universal correlation ( known as wk correlation )",
    "was found between the centroid frequencies of lfqpos and break frequencies of band - limited components in bh - lmxbs , accreting millisecond pulsars , and atoll sources @xcite .",
    "z sources also showed a tight correlation between hbo and break frequencies , only slightly shifted from the bh / atoll track . @xcite found the pbk correlation which links the lower kilohertz frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpo ) to lfqpos in these systems .",
    "the lfqpos involved in wk / pbk correlations in bh - lmxbs and ns - lmxbs were type c qpos and hbos , respectively .",

    "lfqpos show a tight correlation with spectral states , which gives us an empirical way to study the accretion disc around compact objects .",
    "they could be a key ingredient in understanding the physical mechanism that modulates the different states .",
    "meanwhile , the wk and pbk correlations suggested that lfqpos probably have a same origin in these different systems , providing us with a new vision to study the physical mechanism of lfqpos .",

    "the origin of lfqpos in ns - lmxbs has been a controversial topic ever since they were discovered @xcite .",
    "the special shifted behavior of z sources in wk / pbk scheme made the physical mechanism of lfqpos in ns - lmxbs somewhat more confusing .",
    "xte j1701 - 462 is a special transient ns - lmxb source discovered by rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) @xcite , which has gone through both types of z behaviour and , at the end of its outburst , became an atoll source @xcite .",
    "this source gives us a great opportunity to study the lfqpo mechanism among different subclasses of individual source on the basis of wk / pbk correlation . as a persistent `` sco - like '' z source , gx 17 + 2 displayed a roughly constant level over a long time scale , unlike xte j1701 - 462 , which was a transient @xcite",
    "however , there is a strong similarity in spectral evolution between gx 17 + 2 and xte j1701 - 462 @xcite .",
    "comparing these two sources could give us a contrast view in studying the properties of hbos and break components and investigating the shifted behavior of z sources in wk / pbk correlations .",

    "we discuss physical implications of our results .",
    "a short summary is represented in section 5 .",
    "we analyzed all 866 observations of xte j1701 - 462 obtained by the proportional counter array ( pca ) instrument on board rxte during its 2006 - 2007 outburst .",
    "we chose 63 rxte observations of gx 17 + 2 obtained in the period 1999 oct 3 - 12 ( i.e. , mjd 51454 - 51463 ) for a comparison study .",

    "high time resolution single - bit and event mode data were used to create pds , without background - subtraction or dead - time correction .",
    "we studied the properties of lfqpos ( in this case , hbos ) and band - limited components by selecting box regions along the horizontal branch in the hid , accumulating what are known as sz - resolved spectra . the boxes for each interval are shown in fig . 1 : each box corresponds to @xmath13 s of data .",
    "a rank number sz was given for boxes to track their positions along z track @xcite .",
    "we set the sz of the hb / nb vertex as 1 and the leftmost point of the hb as 0 , also marked in fig .",
    "the sz of other boxes are obtained by spline interpolation @xcite .    for each box ,",
    "pds are accumulated from 16s segments and a time bin of @xmath14 s ( yielding a frequency range 0.0625 - 128 hz ) , then averaged to obtain a single pds per box .",
    "since few photons are detected in very high energy bands , the channel range considered is 0 - 149 , corresponding to energy range 2 - 67 kev .",
    "we fitted the pds with a multi - lorentzian function @xcite .",
    "pds were plotted in representation of @xmath15 times frequency ( @xmath16 ) .",

    "2 shows a representative pds of box 11 from interval a , with best fit lorentzians .",
    "each lorentzian , whether used to fit a qpo or band - limited noise , yields three parameters : a centroid frequency ( @xmath17 ) , a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , and an integrated fractional rms .",
    "then the characteristic frequency @xmath18 for a particular component can be calculated by using @xmath19 , as introduced by @xcite .",
    "we will indicate the characteristic frequency of the hbo as @xmath20 and that of the band - limited component as @xmath21 .    in order to study the energy dependence of hbo and band - limited component , we further divided the pca channel 0 - 149 interval into 6 sub - channels . the division of energy channels and their corresponding centroid energies are listed in tab .",

    "we also consider data from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the corresponding wk correlation is shown in fig .",
    "our points from xte j1701 - 462 lie on the main wk track , between the outer edge of atoll sources and lower edge of z sources , covering most of the points from the 11 hz accreting pulsar igr j17480 - 2446 .",
    "meanwhile , the points from sco - like stage , with frequency range @xmath12 30 - 60 hz , are blanketed with the points from cyg - like stage .",
    "it is worth noticing that data of xte j1701 - 462 , bhcs and part of atoll sources are on a straight line .",
    "however , our data points for gx 17 + 2 are distributed in the upper envelop of xte j1701 - 462 , overlapping the data of typical z sources , showing a slightly shifted correlation from the main cone .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that part of the z data taken from the literature also belonged to gx 17 + 2 , extracted from earlier observation .",
    "our result for the wk correlation is consistent with what @xcite had found in gx 17 + 2 .",
    "to study the shifted behavior of z sources , we further plotted the second harmonic frequencies of hbos ( @xmath29 ) for both sources in the wk correlation .",
    "we found that the points of @xmath29 from xte j1701 - 462 overlap with the points of @xmath20 from gx 17 + 2 and typical z sources .",
    "furthermore , the points of @xmath29 from gx 17 + 2 are distributed on the upper side of typical z sources .",

    "we did nt measure the khz qpo frequencies ourselves .",
    "since @xcite already found 14 observations with khz qpo in xte j1701 - 462 , we further searched the hbo signal in these observations to study the pbk relation .",
    "7 observations are found with both @xmath30 and @xmath20 in the sco - like stage , with their ids and frequencies listed in tab .",

    "@xcite had measured the khz qpos and hbos on sz - resolved spectra .",

    "however , as can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "4 , the data of xte j1701 - 462 show a larger spread around the correlation than those of gx 17 + 2 , overlapping with the data of gx 17 + 2 and atoll sources ( 4u 1608 - 52 and 4u 1728 - 34 ) .      in order to test the hypothesis that the band - limited and hbo components have the same origin , we analysed the data from the 6 sub - channels ( listed in tab .",
    "2 , see above ) . in xte j1701 - 462 ,",
    "7 boxes ( with 6 of them in cyg - like stage and 1 in sco - like stage ) were selected out from 4 intervals , judging by the appearance of hbo signals in all 6 sub - channels .",
    "we also investigated the energy dependence of the rms amplitude of the components ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "when calculating the rms amplitude , we took into account the background contribution to convert power to rms amplitude .",
    "we neglected the background contribution for the total energy band since its effect is negligible , but considered its contribution for all the sub - channel bands .",
    "the formula is like @xmath31 , where s and b stand for source and background count rates , and p is the power normalized according to leahy .",
    "we also considered the systematic uncertainty into background as introduced by @xcite .",
    "5 shows the rms - energy correlation for these two components .",
    "the values of @xmath32 are indicated in the upper left corner of each sub - figure .",
    "the trends of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with energy are similar in both cyg - like and sco - like stages .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 increase significantly with photon energy below @xmath25 kev , and stay more or less constant after @xmath25 kev .",
    "we used straight lines to fit the first 5 data points for both components , respectively .",

    "r - squared represents the coefficient of determination , indicating how well the model fits the data .",
    "we found that the slopes for the break component ( a1 ) are consistent with each other within the error ( @xmath34 ) in all 7 sub - figures , while those for hbo component ( a2 ) also have a same value ( @xmath35 ) within the error .",
    "however , for gx 17 + 2 , the detection significance of hbos in 6 energy bands are not good enough to do the similar work as in xte j1701 - 462",

    "our results show that both @xmath1 and @xmath0 show a similar trend in all 5 intervals , i.e. they all decrease with sz .",

    "the hbos in gx 17 + 2 should also be fundamental qpos , not harmonics .",
    "thus , the shifted z track in wk correlation should be caused by hbos in persistent z sources , not harmonics , even the harmonics of hbos in xte j1701 - 462 overlap with the shifted z track .",
    "xte j1701 - 462 has a more scattered distribution than gx 17 + 2 in the pbk correlation .",

    "the proportion of comptonization component in sco - like stage ( gx 17 + 2 ) is higher than at the hb / nb vertex , which causes a lowest rms to take place at the hb / nb vertex .",
    "thus , the three distinguishable tracks contributed by hb , gx 17 + 2 and hb / nb vertex could be caused by different proportions of comptonization in the total flux .",
    "the transient properties of some sources can be interpreted by the disc instability model @xcite , which assumes the accretion disc gains mass from the mass donor at a constant mass transfer rate .",
    "the accretion rate is normally lower than the mass supply rate in the disc , thus mass is accumulated in the disc .",
    "when the accumulated mass exceeds a certain critical value , a sudden increase of accretion rate results in an outburst .",
    "by contrast , the persistent systems have a relatively stable accretion disc .",
    "the accretion disc tends to be more unstable in transient sources when they have an outburst , which would affect the oscillation in corona .",
    "this could be a reason why transient sources have a wider variation in @xmath20 and @xmath21 in wk / pbk schema if they are assumed to arise from different areas of corona .",
    "the persistent sources shifted from main track could be caused by the size of corona in persistent sources is different from transient sources .",
    "all these suggestions still need further study .",
    "in this article , we studied the hbos and band - limited components observed in the unique transient z source xte j1701 - 462 and the persistent  sco - like \" z source gx 17 + 2 .",
    "our results show that the wk / pbk main track forms a boundary which separates persistent sources from transient sources .",
    "the shifted z track is probably not caused by by a misidentification of harmonics .",
    "the characteristic frequencies are independent of accretion rate in both gx 17 + 2 and xte j1701 - 462 , under the assumption of certain spectral models .",
    "we suggest that the hbo and break components from both sources probably come from a similar physical mechanism : comptonization emission in the corona .",
    "these two components could be caused by same type of oscillation in corona with uneven density , and they could be produced in different area of corona .",
    "we suggest it is the different proportions of the comptonization component in total flux that cause the difference distribution between gx 17 + 2 and xte j1701 - 462 in @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram .",
    "we are grateful to y. n. wang , h. q. gao , z. zhang for data reduction and theory suggestions .",
