    "the motion of test bodies in the kerr metric of a rotating black hole has been studied for almost half a century ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "much of the more recent work is motivated by the need to understand radiative inspirals into a kerr black hole as sources of gravitational waves for future detector experiments .",
    "examples of recent work include an action - angle formalism @xcite , a frequency - domain method for computing functionals of the orbit ( such as the gravitational perturbation from an orbiting test particle ) @xcite , a system for classifying kerr orbits @xcite , and an analytic method for solving the geodesic equations of motion @xcite .",
    "timelike geodesics of the kerr geometry are completely integrable .",
    "they admit three nontrivial constants of motion ( `` first integrals '' ) , each associated with a killing field of the kerr background : the time - translation and rotational killing vectors give rise to conserved ( specific ) orbital energy @xmath0 and azimuthal angular momentum @xmath1 , and the second - rank killing tensor discovered by carter @xcite gives rise to what is known as the carter constant , @xmath2 .",
    "up to initial conditions , these three constants of motion uniquely label all timelike geodesics of the kerr geometry .    this paper is concerned with the family of _ bound _ geodesic orbits .",
    "each bound orbit is confined to the interior of a compact spatial torus given by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where hereafter @xmath5 are boyer - lindquist ( bl ) coordinates , @xmath6 are two radial turning points ( `` periastron '' and `` apastron '' , respectively ) , and @xmath7 are two longitudinal turning points .",
    "generically , the motion is ergodic , in the sense that a generic orbit will pass arbitrarily close to any point on the torus within a finite time @xmath8 ( exceptional are `` resonant '' orbits , mentioned briefly below ) .",
    "the triplet @xmath9 provides an alternative parametrization of bound geodesics , which is in a one - to - one correspondence with that of @xmath10 .",
    "is one - to - one can be establishing in the following way .",
    "we first note that schmidt @xcite provides formula for @xmath10 in terms of @xmath11 , and that there is a bijection between @xmath12 ( straightforward to see from eqs .   and their inverse ) .",
    "furthermore eqs .   and",
    "imply that @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( and hence @xmath16 ) are given uniquely in terms of @xmath17 .",
    "the existence of these relations asserts that the original mapping is one - to - one . ]    generically , bound orbits are triperiodic , with three frequencies @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 associated with the motions in the radial , longitudinal and azimuthal directions , respectively .",
    "of these , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are `` libration''-type frequencies , defined from the ( average ) radial and longitudinal periods , while @xmath20 is a `` rotation''-type frequency , describing the average rate at which the bl azimuthal phase @xmath21 accumulates in time .",
    "we define the above frequencies with respect to bl time @xmath8 ; this is useful for many purposes , because @xmath8 is also the proper time of an asymptotically far static observer ( e.g. , a gravitational - wave detector ) .",
    "it is important to note that , in general , the orbital radius @xmath22 and polar angle @xmath23 of a given orbit are _ not _ ( separately ) periodic functions of @xmath8 : the @xmath8-interval between successive periastron passages is not constant , and the @xmath8-interval between successive @xmath24 passages is not constant either .",
    "there is a choice of a time variable ( the so - called `` mino time''see sec .",
    "[ sec : kerr_freqs ] below ) in terms of which the radial and longitudinal motions completely separate and become precisely periodic .",
    "however , in terms of bl time @xmath8 , the orbital periodicity can generally only be defined through an infinite time average ( or , equivalently , through an average over the orbital torus @xcite ) .",
    "we shall define the bl - time frequencies more precisely below , following schmidt @xcite and drasco and hughes @xcite    the above general description simplifies in several special cases . if the ratio @xmath25 is a rational number ( `` resonant orbits '' ) , then the trajectory traced by the orbit in the @xmath22@xmath23 plane is closed ( with a finite @xmath8-period ) , and the ergodicity property",
    "if the orbit is equatorial ( @xmath26 ) , then @xmath27 loses its meaning , and the orbit becomes biperiodic with frequencies @xmath18 and @xmath28 ; in this case the radial motion is strictly periodic , with a radial period @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , if the orbit is circular ( @xmath30 ) , then @xmath31 loses its meaning , the orbit becomes biperiodic with frequencies @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and the longitudinal motion is strictly periodic with period @xmath32 .",
    "( orbits that are both equatorial and circular are singly periodic with frequency @xmath28 . ) finally , in the special case of a schwarzschild black hole , one can always set up the bl system so that the orbit is equatorial and biperiodic with frequencies @xmath18 and @xmath28 .",
    "the purpose of this article is to challenge the commonly held notion ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that the trio of frequencies @xmath33 provides a good parametrization of generic bound geodesics in kerr , i.e. , one which is in a one - to - one correspondence with @xmath10 or @xmath9 .",
    "we show that this is not the case : there are infinitely many pairs of `` isofrequency '' orbits , which are physically distinct ( i.e. , have different @xmath10 values ) and yet they share the same values of @xmath33 .",
    "this point was already made briefly by two of us in appendix a of @xcite in reference to a schwarzschild black hole ( where orbits are biperiodic , and two isofrequency orbits share the same values of @xmath28 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "here we first revisit the schwarzschild problem to provide a further illumination of this phenomenon , and then extend the analysis to the kerr case , showing that isofrequency pairing occurs even among triperiodic orbits .",
    "we shall on occasion refer to a pair of isofrequency orbits as `` synchronous '' , because the phases of such orbits remain synchronized in an average sense .",
    "for example , two equatorial isofrequency orbits that pass through their periastra simultaneously at @xmath34 will reach their next periastra at the same time and with the same azimuthal phase ; they will have experienced an identical amount of periastron advance .",
    "although such orbits go `` in and out of phase '' between periastron passages , their phase remains synchronized `` on average '' .",
    "we will present some graphics to illustrate this behavior .    throughout this article",
    "we use geometric units such that the gravitational constant and the speed of light are both equal to unity .",
    "we denote the black hole s mass and spin by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "we use an over - tilde to denote adimensionalization using @xmath35 ; for example , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we adopt a convention whereby @xmath39 and @xmath40 correspond to prograde and retrograde orbits , respectively , with @xmath1 always positive .",
    "we use the term `` orbit '' synonymously with `` timelike geodesic orbit '' . in sec .",
    "[ sec : schwarzschild ] we consider ( biperiodic ) synchronous orbits in schwarzschild geometry ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "we delineate the region in the parameter space where such orbits occur , and also provide an intuitive explanation as to why isofrequency pairing must occur . in sec .",
    "[ sec : kerr ] we generalize our discussion to the kerr case , where we consider first equatorial orbits and then generic , triperiodic orbits .",
    "the radial motion of geodesic test particles in the equatorial plane of a schwarzschild black hole satisfies @xmath42 where a dot denotes differentiation with respect to proper - time , and @xmath43 is an effective potential for the radial motion .",
    "bound orbits exist for @xmath44 with @xmath45 . for each @xmath46 in this range , @xmath47 has three real roots , and motion is allowed between the second largest and largest of these , which we label @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "a convenient alternative parametrization of bound orbits is provided by the pair of values @xmath50 defined through @xmath51 which are relativistic generalizations of semi - latus rectum and eccentricity , respectively @xcite .",
    "this parametrization is in a one - to - one correspondence with that of @xmath46 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath52 which can be inverted ( for real @xmath53 ) to give unique expressions for @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in the @xmath56 space ,",
    "bound orbits span the range @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "the boundary @xmath59 ( `` separatrix '' ) separates between stable and unstable orbits in the @xmath56 space @xcite .",
    "the @xmath60 terminus of the separatrix curve is known as the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "the existence of a separatrix is one of the salient features of motion in black hole spacetimes , and it marks a major qualitative departure from newtonian dynamics .",
    "as we shall see , the occurrence of isofrequency pairing of orbits is intimately related to the existence of a separatrix .",
    "the function @xmath61 is periodic with ( @xmath8-)period @xmath62 .",
    "following darwin @xcite , it is convenient to introduce the `` relativistic anomaly '' parameter @xmath63 , which is related to @xmath8 via @xmath64^{1/2}(p-6 - 2e\\cos\\chi)^{-1/2}}{(p-2 - 2e\\cos\\chi)(1+e\\cos\\chi)^2}\\ , , \\hskip3 mm   \\label{eq : dt_dchi}\\ ] ] and in terms of which the radial motion is given simply by @xmath65 ( taking @xmath66 at a periastron passage ) .",
    "the radial period can then be computed via @xmath67 with associated radial frequency @xmath68    the _ azimuthal _ frequency of the orbit is defined as the average of @xmath69 ( with respect to @xmath8 ) over a complete radial period : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the azimuthal phase accumulated over time interval @xmath62 .",
    "the latter can be computed via @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . at the separatrix limit ,",
    "@xmath75 , both @xmath71 and @xmath62 diverge at a similar rate [ see eqs .",
    "( [ deltaphiasy ] ) and ( [ trasy ] ) below ] , so that @xmath76 while @xmath20 attains a finite value [ @xmath77 , corresponding to the frequency of the unstable circular orbit of radius @xmath78 .",
    "this gives rise to the well known `` zoom - whirl '' behavior @xcite : orbits with @xmath79 can `` whirl '' around the black hole many times near the periastron before `` zooming '' back out towards the apastron .",
    "as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the jacobian matrix of the transformation @xmath80 turns out to be singular along a certain curve in the parameter space , well _ outside _ the separatrix .",
    "this indicates that the transformation is not bijective . to see this most",
    "clearly it is instructive to move to a new orbital parametrization given by the pair @xmath81 .",
    "this reparametrization is admissible because ( i ) as argued above , the original parametrization @xmath56 is a good one , and ( ii ) as can be easily checked , @xmath28 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath82 for any fixed @xmath83 .",
    "our argument now follows from examining the structure of the @xmath84 contour lines in the @xmath81 plane , as shown in figure [ fig : schwarzschild_omega_phi_e ] .",
    "the key feature here is that some @xmath84 contours have vertical tangents ( the locus of which is shown by the dashed black line in the figure ) .",
    "each of these contour lines is intersected _ twice _ by vertical lines just right of the vertical tangent .",
    "but vertical lines are also @xmath85 contours , and so the two intersections mark a pair of isofrequency orbits .",
    "( any two such isofrequency orbits are clearly physically distinct : they have different eccentricities . )    in fig .",

    "the radial and azimuthal motions of these two orbits are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : schwarzschild_example_r_phi ] .",
    "since the rate of relativistic periastron advance depends only on the frequency ratio @xmath86 , two isofrequency orbits will exhibit the same rate of advance .",

    "we further validated our equations using a direct numerical integration of the @xmath193-time geodesic equations in a few test cases . we were able to reproduce the analytically calculated @xmath193-frequencies @xmath194 and @xmath195 to within 25 significant figures .",
    "( the quantities @xmath196 and @xmath197 involve infinite time averages and are therefore less easily tested in this manner . )",
    "in this article we have shown that the three fundamental frequencies of bound geodesics in kerr geometry do not constitute a good parametrization of the orbits in the strong - field regime .",
    "we identified a mapping between pairs of physically distinct orbits that possess the same set of orbital frequencies .",
    "a pair of isofrequency orbits are `` synchronous '' in that they exhibit the same periastron and lense - thirring precession rates .",
    "all orbits in isofrequency pairs are confined to the very strong - field regime near the innermost stable orbit  cf .",
    "table [ table ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : omegaminmax ] .",
    "( some orbits in isofrequency pairs have very large eccentricities and apastra at arbitrarily large radii , but their periastra are in the very strong field . )",
    "our numerical experiments suggest that all members of isofrequency pairs are of `` zoom - whirl '' type , but this is yet to be checked more thoroughly in the case of triperiodic orbits and across all spin values .",
    "the first practical lesson from our analysis is a cautionary note for colleagues studying the data - analysis problem for gravitational - wave detectors , in particular the problem of parameter extraction for systems of extreme - mass - ratio inspirals ( emris ) .",
    "the fundamental frequencies extracted from a `` snapshot '' of an emri waveform , on their own , as a matter of principle , do not necessarily provide enough information from which to extract the system s intrinsic physical parameters @xmath198 ( or @xmath199 ) .",
    "if the system is sufficiently close to the innermost stable orbit , a measurement of the instantaneous frequencies could at most narrow down on two possible sets of system parameters .",
    "this `` degeneracy '' , however , can be removed in any one of the following ways : ( i ) by examining the power spectrum of the waveform ( the power distribution among the various harmonics of the fundamental frequencies will be different for the two orbits ) ; ( ii ) by inspecting the waveform snippet in the time domain ( the shape of the waveform is strongly dependent upon the eccentricity , for instance ) ; or ( iii ) by accounting for radiation - reaction evolution effects ( two orbits which are instantaneously isofrequency will evolve radiatively in different ways ) .    at a more fundamental level",
    ", our analysis identifies a new feature in the strong - field dynamics of compact - object binaries in general relativity .",
    "the fundamental frequencies in a bound binary ( of any mass ratio ) are important invariant characteristics of the `` conservative '' sector of the dynamics . as such",
    "they have long been studied in the context of post - newtonian ( pn ) theory .",
    "the instantaneous frequencies in a binary of inspiralling black holes can even , nowadays , be extracted from high - precision fully nonlinear simulations in numerical relativity ( nr)see , for example , ref .   @xcite .",
    "our analysis here revealed the occurrence of isofrequency pairing in the test - particle limit ( i.e. , the limit of vanishing mass ratio ) , but it is not unreasonable to speculate that the phenomenon is a general feature of the dynamics in strongly gravitating binaries , and would reveal itself also when the mass ratio is finite .",
    "it is not clear if available pn theory can predict isofrequency pairing  this would be interesting to check .",
    "when new , higher - order pn terms are calculated in the future , it would again be interesting to check if they reveal the phenomenon , as a way of assessing the faithfulness of the pn expressions in the strong - field regime .",
    "it would also be interesting to examine whether the phenomenon manifests itself in nr simulations of inspiralling black holes of comparable masses near the innermost stable orbit .    because the fundamental frequencies are _ invariant _ characteristics of the conservative dynamics , they are useful as reference points for comparing the predictions of different approaches to the relativistic two - body problem . recent examples of such `` cross - cultural '' comparisons include ( i ) calculations of the isco frequency in the self - force ( sf )",
    ", pn and effective - one - body ( eob ) approaches @xcite ; and ( ii ) calculations of the periastron advance in slightly eccentric orbits in sf , pn , eob and nr @xcite . in both examples ( which involve two nonrotating black holes ) relations between the two invariant frequencies associated with infinitesimally perturbed circular orbits were utilized as benchmarks for comparison .",
    "the singular curve / surface identified in our current work is an _ invariant structure _ in the parameter space , . ] which provides yet another , independent , comparison point in the strong field , this time utilizing eccentric orbits .    as a first example",
    ", one could consider the function @xmath200 along the singular curve in the parameter space of nonrotating binaries ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schwarzschild_omega_phi_e ] shows this curve in the test - particle limit ) . in principle",
    ", one could compute this function in the sf approximation ( i.e. , order by order in the mass ratio ) , and perhaps also in fully nonlinear nr , making for an interesting comparison",
    ". there may be a way of using the results of such a calculation to calibrate the potentials of eob theory in the strong field , although how this could be done in practice is yet unclear @xcite .",
    "comparison with existing pn expressions could test the performance of the pn expansion in the strong field .",
    "a more constructive synergy could be achieved within the recent `` phenomenological '' approach to pn calculations , whereby high - order terms in the pn expansion are determined by fitting to numerical data from sf or nr calculations @xcite .",
    "a faithful phenomenological pn model would need to be able to recover the singular curve in the strong field , perhaps through the inclusion of suitable `` poles '' in pn expressions .    finally , let us mention the intriguing possibility that isofrequency pairing in astrophysical black holes ( e.g. , between clumps of accreting matter ) could have observational implications .",
    "the question is worth asking because we are at an era where astronomical observations in a range of electromagnetic wavelengths routinely peer into processes deep in the strong - field potentials of accreting black holes .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in x - rays from accreting black - hole systems probe the innermost regions of accretion disks @xcite , and ( to a lesser extent ) so do x - ray flares from the galactic center @xcite .",
    "could the peculiar strong - gravity phenomenon of isofrequency pairing have a dynamical effect on matter orbiting the black hole , perhaps through resonant interaction ?",
    "although admittedly far - fetched , this possibility deserves exploration .",
