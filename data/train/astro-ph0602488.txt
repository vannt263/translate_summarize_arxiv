    "the models and some modifications added to them are briefly described .    in this study ,",
    "a couple of hydrodynamic studies of `` exploding '' core - collapse supernovae are closely referred , in order to link the current parametrized models to more realistic ones .",
    "one is the one - dimensional core - collapse simulation of a @xmath24 progenitor star in @xcite .",
    "this is in fact only the case that followed the wind phase for long duration ( up to @xmath25 ) , which is relevant for the current study .",
    "it is cautioned , however , that the neutrino transport was treated rather approximately , which makes it difficult to obtain the reliable time evolution of @xmath1 in the neutrino - processed material .",
    "note also that the spatial @xmath1 distribution can not be obtained with one - dimensional simulations .",
    "the other is the two dimensional simulation of a collapsing @xmath26 progenitor by @xcite , which is also taken in @xcite .",
    "the simulation was limited to the first @xmath27 after core bounce ( and linked to a one - dimensional simulation up to @xmath28 ) , but the accurate neutrino transport was taken into account .",
    "therefore , the obtained time variation of @xmath1 and its spatial distribution may be reliable .",
    "the system is treated as time stationary and spherically symmetric , and the radius of the neutron star is assumed to be the same as that of the neutrino sphere .",
    "the physical variables in the wind are then expressed as functions of the distance @xmath29 from the center of the neutron star .",
    "the ejected mass by neutrino heating is assumed to be negligible compared to the mass of the neutron star .",
    "therefore , the gravitational field in which the neutrino - heated matter moves can be treated as a fixed - background schwarzschild metric .",

    "the source term in the equation of energy conservation is due to both heating and cooling by neutrino interactions .",
    "the gravitational redshift of the neutrino energies , and the bending of the neutrino trajectories expected from general relativistic effects , are explicitly taken into account @xcite .",
    "the neutrino luminosities @xmath33 of all neutrino flavors are assumed to be equal , and the rms average neutrino energies are taken to be 10 , 20 , and 30  mev , for electron , anti - electron , and the other flavors of neutrinos , respectively .",
    "as the boundary conditions at the neutrino sphere , the density is taken to be @xmath34 and the temperature is determined so that heating and cooling by neutrino interactions are in equilibrium . the mass ejection rate at the neutrino sphere @xmath35 that determines the initial velocity is set to be @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 is the critical value that gives the transonic solution .",
    "the wind with @xmath37 becomes supersonic through the sonic point , while those with @xmath38 are subsonic throughout .",
    "in fact , recent hydrodynamic simulations show that the fast wind collides with the dense shell of slower ejecta behind the shock and is decelerated again to be subsonic ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand , the subsonic wind , which can not escape by itself from the gravitational potential , must be enough fast ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) to reach the early _ bubble _ ejecta .",

    "the latter ( @xmath3 ) was regarded as the test case of higher entropy winds ( about a factor of two ) , which might be expected in more realistic hydrodynamic simulations of core - collapse supernovae .",

    "the nuclear flow proceeds to @xmath332 , resulting in the production of _",

    "the higher _",
    "p_-nuclei up to @xmath5 are synthesized with interesting amounts as @xmath1 rises to @xmath335 .",
    "the termination of the _ rp_-process is due to the increasing coulomb barrier for the heaviest nuclei in the nuclear flow , _ not _ due to the exhaustion of free protons .",
    "the decrease of the temperature below @xmath336 owing to the expansion of the ejecta is also a cause of the termination .",
    "the supply of neutrons by the neutrino capture on protons is sufficient throughout the _ rp_-process phase .",
    "hence the dilution of the neutrino flux by the expansion of matter is not the principal reason for the termination of the _ rp_-process in the current wind models .",
    "p_-nuclei beyond @xmath5 are produced by the neutrino - induced _",
    "rp_-process , owing to the increasing coulomb barrier for heavier nuclei .",
    "the high entropy ( @xmath337 ) or highly proton - rich ( @xmath338 ) wind results in driving the nuclear abundances to the @xmath87-stability or even the neutron - rich region , when the temperature drops below @xmath214 . in this case , a variety of neutron - rich isotopes , which are generally assign to _ s_-nuclei or _",
    "r_-nuclei , are synthesized even in the proton - rich compositions .",
    "@xmath6mo is produced with interesting amounts in the slightly neutron - rich winds ( @xmath339 ) , much more than in the proton - rich winds .",
    "this is due to the proton capture reactions at @xmath340 , which carry a portion of the nuclear abundances from the abundant @xmath8zr to @xmath6mo .",
    "the amount of the produced @xmath6mo is , however , highly dependent on the thermodynamic history of the wind .",
    "the neutrino - driven winds can be the origin of some light _",
    "p_-nuclei , at least of @xmath21se , @xmath22kr , @xmath23sr , and @xmath6mo , and likely of @xmath254mo , @xmath12ru , @xmath271pd , and @xmath272cd , supplemented by the production of @xmath6mo in the slightly neutron - rich compositions .",
    "in particular , this can be the unique astrophysical site responsible for the production of the proton - rich mo and ru isotopes .",
    "the heavier _",
    "p_-nuclei ( @xmath341 ) may have another origin , most likely the o / ne layers in core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "note that the _ p_-nuclei synthesized in neutrino - driven winds are regarded as _",
    "primary_. this is contrast to those produced in the o / ne layers , which need the _",
    "s_-process seed abundances and thus regarded as _",
    "note that the neutrino - induced _",
    "rp_-process in the current study may not contribute to the production of any _ elements _ , since the fraction of _",
    "p_-process isotopes for a given element is generally an order of one percent .",
    "therefore , it would be challenging to confirm the occurrence of the neutrino - induced _",
    "rp_-process by spectroscopic studies of extremely metal - poor stars , which are expected to preserve the nucleosynthetic signature from a single ( or a few ) supernova ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "analysis of the isotope anomalies in some elements found in primitive meteorites ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or measurements of galactic cosmic - rays might provide us some clues .    at the end of this investigation",
    ", it should be cautioned that the nucleosynthesis calculations in the current study are based on a schematic formulation of neutrino - driven winds , which must be in fact closely related to the unknown mechanism of core - collapse supernovae .",
    "in addition , the estimation of the _ p_-nuclei production in each event ( i.e. , the core - collapse supernova that leaves the proto - neutron star with @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) was based on the @xmath1 distribution during the _ bubble _ ( not wind ) phase , obtained from one specific hydrodynamic simulation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the current results should _ not _ be regarded as the quantitative predictions that is to be used for the galactic chemical evolution study .",
    "nevertheless , the current study provides us some notable implications .",
    "first , it is likely that the neutrino - induced _",
    "rp_-process takes place in _ all _ core - collapse supernovae to some extent , even with a moderate entropy . in this sense , other astrophysical sites than standard core - collapse events , e.g. , collapsar jets or disk winds formed around a black hole , which are associated to gamma - ray bursts",
    ", can be the astrophysical site for the neutrino - induced _",
    "second , details of the nucleosynthesis process are presented for selected winds , which will be useful for the future experimental studies of proton - rich nuclei far from the @xmath87-stability . in particular , core - collapse supernovae no doubt eject the nucleosynthetic products that contribute to the galactic chemical evolution of heavy nuclei .",
    "this is in contrast to x - ray bursts , which is unlikely to contribute the galactic chemical evolution",
    ". therefore the experimental estimations can be easily tested by comparing the nucleosynthesis calculations to , e.g. , the solar compositions .",
    "third , the systematic calculations for the wide ( but reasonable ) ranges of the neutrino luminosities and the electron fractions enable us to make a meaningful comparison with the solar abundances .",
    "in particular , a notable aspect is that @xmath6mo has another origin ( i.e. , neutron - rich winds ) while other light _",
    "p_-nuclei are mainly synthesized by the _ rp_-process ( i.e. , in proton - rich winds ) even in a _",
    "single _ event .",
    "this will serve unique constraints to the fluid dynamics of the early supernova ejecta .",
