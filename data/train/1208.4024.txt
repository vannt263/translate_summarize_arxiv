    "the work by @xcite has shown that sunspots can absorb up to half the power of incident @xmath6modes . at the same time",
    ", part of the wave flux is scattered .",
    "the @xmath6mode absorption and scattering phase shifts depend on the frequency , degree , radial order , and azimuthal order of the incident mode @xcite , and also on the magnetic structure , making the study of the scattering a promising way to infer the subsurface structure of sunspots and other magnetic features . in these studies",
    "the authors used hankel analysis , a method which decomposes the @xmath6modes into inward and outward propagating waves in annuli surrounding the sunspot .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed absorption , mode conversion @xcite being the principal candidate .",
    "when an acoustic wave encounters a magnetic field concentration , it is split into fast and slow modes .",
    "this mode transformation occurs at the height where the alfvn and sound velocities are comparable , since at that layer the distinction between the modes is small . below this height the sound speed is higher than the alfvn speed and the modes are effectively decoupled .",
    "the fast mode is an acoustic - like wave , while the slow mode is similar to an alfvn wave and propagates along field lines removing energy from the acoustic wave .",
    "the observed absorption of @xmath0modes can be accounted for by a vertical magnetic field @xcite , but the @xmath6mode absorption obtained from this model is insufficient .",
    "however , the presence of inclined magnetic field produces significant increases in absorption with a peak at around 30@xmath7 @xcite , which are consistent with observed values @xcite .",
    "other mechanisms may also play a role .",
    "one of them is resonant absorption @xcite .",
    "it may occur when the flux tube has a smooth variation of the magnetic field rather than discontinuous , and represents absorption of wave energy by the transition layer when the incident acoustic waves resonantly excite mhd waves in the magnetic structure .",
    "however , the amount of absorption achieved by this mechanism can not explain the observed loss of @xmath6mode power .",
    "@xcite points out that apart from this absorption produced by the dissipation of the @xmath6modes in resonant layers and mode conversion , mode mixing also takes places . in this process",
    "the power of an incident @xmath6mode mode with a certain frequency and degree @xmath8 can be dispersed into an outgoing @xmath6mode with the same frequency , but different degree .",
    "flux tubes are a key feature to understand solar magnetic activity .",
    "they are spread all over the solar surface and couple different layers of the solar atmosphere .",
    "it has been proposed that magnetic flux tubes can act as wave guides , being one of the possible sources which supply energy to the upper layers to account for the chromospheric and coronal heating @xcite .",
    "the interaction of @xmath6modes with thin flux tubes excites tube waves , including sausage waves , which are axisymmetric , longitudinal waves driven by variations in the total pressure , and kink waves , whose restoring force is magnetic tension and buoyancy , producing transversal oscillations .",
    "these waves propagate upward or downward and extract energy from the @xmath6modes of the acoustic cavity @xcite .",
    "the kink mode is driven by the distortion of the tube produced by the harmonic flow field of the @xmath6modes , while the sausage wave is excited by the pressure pertubations associated to the acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms are different from mode conversion , discussed in the previous paragraph , where fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves exchange energy due to their strong coupling in the region where the sound and alfvn speeds are comparable .",
    "recently , @xcite used numerical simulations to study the scattering of an @xmath0mode by vertical flux tubes of different sizes , finding that the scattering by tubes with small radius is dominated by the kink mode , while the sausage mode is dominant for large tubes .",
    "this result coincides with the earlier work by @xcite , who studied analytically the nature of wave interactions with thin flux tubes @xcite and found that the kink mode is the dominant tube wave .",
    "the thin flux tube approximation assumes that the diameter of the tube is smaller in comparison to the pressure scale height , and thus the horizontal variations inside it can be neglected .",
    "@xcite evaluated the scattering matrix associated with an @xmath0mode that interacts with a thin flux tube in a stratified atmosphere , focusing on the kink mode excited in the magnetic tube .",
    "they found that most of the scattered wave corresponds to an @xmath0mode with amplitude of 1.17% and with a phase shift of abound 50@xmath7 relative to the incident wave , overstimating the observed value by a factor of 8.8 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the recent work by @xcite analyzed the axisymmetric scattering of @xmath6modes , mediated through the excitation of sausage waves on the flux tube , instead of the kink mode .",
    "they obtained a small absorption due to the poor coupling between the @xmath0mode and the sausage mode for thin flux tubes , as pointed out by some of the works previously described in this paragraph .",
    "although these theoretical works have provided the first predictions about the modification of the solar wave field produced by flux tubes , as far as our concern no attempt has been made to observationally measure the detailed properties of the scattering produced by these small magnetic elements , with the exception of the estimates of amplitude and phase of monopole and dipole scattering by @xcite .",
    "one of the objectives of this work is to present the measurement of the phase shift and its variations with the azimuthal orders @xmath5 and degree @xmath9 .",
    "this data is a fundamental input to confront with the theory . on the other hand ,",
    "most theoretical studies of this topic have been based on an analytical development .",
    "all of them have been restricted by some limitations , including the use of the thin flux tube approximation , the lack of the gravitational stratification , the analysis of a polytrope instead of a realistic solar atmosphere , or some constrains in the process that mediates the scattering .",
    "numerical simulations are a more versatile approach and allow us to study more general situations .    in this work",
    "we study the scattering of an @xmath0mode by flux tubes of different radius and magnetic flux using numerical simulations . as discussed previously",
    ", it is well known that thin flux tubes support sausage and kink modes @xcite . on the other hand , in unstratified atmospheres permeated by homogeneous magnetic fields one would expect the propagation of pure fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves and alfvn mode .",
    "in atmosphere stratified by gravity ( for example ) the fast , slow , and alfvn waves are coupled in general and this distinction between modes no longer applies , but even in these cases it is useful to refer to this simple picture to discuss the properties of fast and slow magnetoacoustic - like waves ( in regions where the sound and alfvn speed differ greatly ) . in the case of thick flux tube models , representative of a sunspot , for example , acoustic waves can be converted into these modes by means of mode conversion .",
    "the flux tube models presented in this paper correspond to an intermediate case between these two extremes .",
    "we expect a smooth transition ( with increasing radius ) from mostly excitation of the kink and sausage modes at small radius , to excitation of waves that look like the fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves of a thick flux tube ( at large radius ) . however , in this study we made no attempt to distinguish between neither the different wave modes which are present nor the mechanisms that generates them .",
    "instead , we will refer to `` tube modes '' or `` tube waves excitation '' indistinctly .",
    "we aim to carry out a direct comparison between the numerical and observational results by performing a hankel analysis of the data obtained from the interaction of an @xmath0mode with flux tubes .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [",
    "sect : observations ] we introduce the observations used in this study .",
    "section [ sect : procedures ] briefly describes the numerical code and the set up of the simulations . in sections [ sect :",
    "scattering ] and [ sect : jacket ] , we present the tube mode excitation , the scattering , and the jacket modes produced in these simulations",
    ". the results of the hankel analysis are shown in section [ sect : hankel ] , including a comparison with observations , and finally we conclude with a summary of our calculations and a discussion of their applicability to understanding observations .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to understand how small magnetic elements affect @xmath10-mode wave propagation .",
    "the comparison of observations of magnetic elements on the sun with equivalent measurements obtained from numerical simulations can help infer the properties of the solar magnetic elements .",
    "these comparisons can also be used to assess the limitations of , and potentially improve , the observational techniques .",
    "observations of solar magnetic elements , using dopplergrams obtained from the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _",
    "( soho ) , were analyzed using the fourier - hankel spectral decomposition method , as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the goal of the analysis is the decomposition of the observed line - of - sight velocities into inward and outward propagating waves in an annular region centered on the flux tubes .",
    "this allows us to detect the effect of a magnetic feature on the wave field through the difference between the outward and inward radially propagating hankel components . in a spherical polar coordinate system",

    "the hankel analysis was centered on the locations of small magnetic elements as well as a larger set of control locations offset by fixed distances from each magnetic element .",
    "there were no active regions present in the mdi observations used .",
    "we hereafter refer to the control locations as `` quiet - sun '' regions , although no attempt was made to select ( or exclude ) these locations based on magnetic properties of the mdi pixels .",
    "thus the primary difference between the `` magnetic feature '' and `` quiet sun '' locations is that the former coincide with the peaks of small magnetic flux regions while the latter are pseudo - random locations .",
    "the data consist of the set of 102 `` high - resolution '' mdi doppler and magnetogram datacubes , each with a 4 hr interval , which has been previously used by @xcite to measure travel - time kernels for time - distance helioseismology .",
    "each of the 102 regions are confined to the mdi `` high resolution field '' which spans 11 @xmath20 11 arc minutes and is centered about 160 arc seconds north of disk center @xcite .",
    "the data are obtained from all of the mdi full - resolution observations of at least 4 hours in duration and spanning the years 1996 and 1997 .",
    "the cadence of both the dopplergrams used in the helioseismic analysis , and the magnetograms used for identifying small magnetic elements , is 60 seconds .",
    "the criteria and procedure for the selection of the magnetic elements are described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the average magnetic feature has a peak magnetic flux density of 76 g , and a full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 2.6 mm , as determined from a fit by a 2d gaussian function to the averaged magnetogram @xcite .",
    "we used locations of the features from tables provided to us by duvall . in total , nearly 3400 locations of features were used .",
    "this is a somewhat larger sample than the ( approximately ) 2500 features used by @xcite since we used features closer ( i.e.  as close as 40 pixels ) to the edge of the datacubes than used in that work . there were four quiet - sun locations",
    "offset from each magnetic feature used , thus yielding a quiet - sun control sample of 13,600 .",
    "figure [ fig : magnetogram ] shows the absolute value of the time - averaged magnetic flux density corresponding to one of the doppler datacubes , showing the sample of features for that datacube .",
    "the fourier - hankel decomposition was performed for all locations , and the coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 were determined for waves within an annular domain with colatitude relative to the center point of the analysis @xmath23 ranging from @xmath24 pixels to @xmath25 pixels , where a pixel corresponds to 0.034 heliocentric degrees ( or 0.413 mm ) .",
    "details of the decomposition method are described by @xcite .",
    "the method consists of discrete numerical transforms in the azimuthal , colatitude and temporal domains .",
    "the azimuthal transform is computed for integer values of azimuthal order -10 @xmath26 10 at the highest values of @xmath9 .",
    "not all of these orders @xmath5 are computed ( or useful ) for smaller values of wavenumbers ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the values of @xmath9 and @xmath27 for which the relative colatitude and temporal transforms are computed compose a grid with spacing @xmath28 and @xmath29 mhz , where @xmath30 is the duration of the observations ( 4 hr ) .",
    "we focus in this paper on comparisons between observations and models of phase - shifts between the outgoing and incoming wave components .",
    "our primary motivation for this is that the measurement and interpretation of observations of amplitude differences ( e.g.  due to absorption ) are affected by factors such as the presence of background convective ( or instrumental ) noise and by details of the solar excitation and damping mechanisms of the waves .",
    "we make no attempt to realistically include these in the numerical models described later .",
    "this challenges our ability to make meaningful comparisons of absorption coefficients , for example .",
    "some of these effects further restrict the measurement of phase - shifts to those modes ( typically with lower wavenumbers and temporal frequencies ) which have lifetimes significantly longer than the time the waves take to propagate across the entire annulus @xcite .    to determine feature - averaged phase shifts , we compute the summations , over the magnetic element and quiet sun ensembles , of the product @xmath31 where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "the effects of a  spurious phase - shift caused by the leakage of wave amplitudes across the wavenumber - frequency domain ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are removed by considering the relative _ difference _ in the phase - shift between the magnetic - element and quiet - sun ensembles .",

    "an additional averaging across the width of the @xmath10-mode ridge , at each wavenumber @xmath9 , is performed , such that the resulting phase shift is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the @xmath10-mode frequency at wavenumber @xmath9 .",
    "the window @xmath35 is determined by an inspection of the power spectra @xmath36 such that it contains most of the @xmath10-mode ridge power .",
    "the value of @xmath35 increases from 0.3 mhz at @xmath37 to 0.7 mhz at @xmath38 .",
    "figure [ fig : phase_obs_solo ] shows the observational phase shift , including its variation with @xmath9 for several values of @xmath5 , and its variation with @xmath5 at @xmath39 . in the next section , we describe the model we construct to reproduce these phase shifts .",

    "we have used flux tube models constructed using the method of @xcite , following the routines by @xcite .",
    "we consider three flux tube models : the small flux tube has a radius of 170 km and a photospheric magnetic field strength around 1600 g , with slight variations with height and radial distance inside the tube ; the medium flux tube has the same magnetic field strength , but a radius of 370 km ; and the larger flux tube has also 1600 g photospheric field strength and a radius of 560 km .",
    "the external atmosphere outside the flux tube is the quiet sun model s @xcite stabilized following the method described by @xcite to avoid convective instability .",
    "the radial transition between the magnetic and non - magnetic atmosphere is performed smoothly using a cosine which reduces the magnetic field from its maximum to zero over 100 km in order to avoid numerical problems due to the discontinuity in the magnetic field .",
    "for the small flux tube the magnetic field is strictly zero for radial distances higher than 250 km , in the case of the medium tube it vanishes at 450 km , while for the larger tube the magnetic field is zero beyond a radius of 630 km .",

    "we aim to study the scattering of an @xmath0mode by the flux tube .",
    "the vertical velocity of an @xmath0mode wave packet which propagates from left to right in the x direction in a horizontally homogeneous atmosphere is described by @xcite as :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 means real part , @xmath63 are complex amplitudes , @xmath64 indicates the initial position of the wave packet , @xmath15 is time , and @xmath65 is the eigenfrequency at wavenumber @xmath66 .",

    "in addition to the excitation of tube waves and the scattering into different wave modes presented in the previous sections , a scattering object can also generate jacket modes in its surroundings .",
    "jacket modes were first discussed in the context of solar acoustic oscillations by @xcite .",
    "they consist of a continuous spectrum of horizontally evanescent wave modes which propagate vertically in the non - magnetic region around the flux tube .",
    "the jacket modes are necessary because the vertically evanescent @xmath10- and @xmath98-modes alone can not ensure the continuity of pressure and horizontal velocity of the oscillations across the flux tube boundary , due to the presence of the tube waves that propagate downward at large depth .",
    "the jacket modes obtained in the medium tube simulation can be seen in figure [ fig : conversion ] as the downward propagating waves outside the boundaries of the tube with small vertical wavelength , especially in the horizontal velocity ( right panel ) .",
    "the energy extracted by the flux tube from the @xmath0mode goes to the tube waves and the jacket modes , which transport the energy upward and downward removing energy from the acoustic cavity .",
    "it is interesting to evaluate how the energy is distributed among these modes . in this analysis",
    "we will only consider the energy which goes to deeper layers , represented by a negative energy flux , since the proximity of the top boundary hinders obtaining a reliable positive flux into the atmosphere .",

    "the acoustic flux inside the tube can be obtained as the difference between the acoustic flux in the simulation with the flux tube being present and the quiet sun simulation . with regards to the magnetic wave flux",
    ", it is directly obtained from the application of equation ( [ eq : fmag ] ) to the region where the magnetic field is different from zero . adding both fluxes we retrieve the total energy flux carried downward by the tube waves . at each height , we have summed the energy flux correponding to all the points inside the tube for all the time steps between the time that the @xmath0mode wave packet reaches the tube and the time that the wave packet leaves it . the result is shown in figure [ fig : flux_tube ] , where the variation of the wave energy flux of the tube waves with the height is plotted . around @xmath54 km the total flux vanishes .",
    "above that height the flux is positive , which means that the energy propagates upward , and below @xmath54 mm it is negative , showing a minimum around @xmath105 mm in the case of the two smaller tubes and around @xmath94 mm for the larger tube .",
    "as these waves propagate downward they are damped by the diffusivity , and their energy flux tends to zero at about @xmath106 mm in the case of the 370 km and 560 km radius tube and at @xmath107 mm for the 170 km radius tube .",

    "thus , only the acoustic wave flux contributes to its wave energy .",
    "however , some care must be taken to obtain a correct evaluation of its energy flux .",

    "we have filtered out the low vertical wavenumbers of the scattered velocity in the surroundings of the flux tube , and we have calculated its acoustic flux using that velocity in equation [ eq : fac ] . the filter selects the waves with vertical wavenumber higher than @xmath108 mm@xmath109 and , thus , only waves with vertical wavelength below @xmath110 mm are considered for the jacket modes . at the photosphere",
    "the jacket modes have a vertical wavelength around 1 mm . as they propagate downward ,",

    "the scattered wave may be a different wave mode , with different degree @xmath9 and radial order @xmath166 or azimuthal order @xmath5 . for structures that are stationary in comparison to the typical wave period",

    "the change of the incident mode @xmath166 to a different scattered mode @xmath167 at a fixed frequency produced by a magnetic element is commonly called mode mixing .",
    "in addition , since these flux tube models are axisymmetric , no scattering can be produced from an azimuthal order @xmath5 to a different order @xmath168    we have tried to measure the mode mixing produced by the three magnetic flux tube models . since we are introducing as an initial condition the propagation of an @xmath0mode , we can only estimate the scattering produced from this incident @xmath0mode to higher order modes .",
    "however , from these simulations we have only retrieved a significant amount of power in the @xmath70 ridge , so we have evaluated the scattering from the @xmath0mode to the @xmath70 .",

    "we have introduced as initial condition the analytical expression of a propagating @xmath0mode . however , due to the limited size of our computational domain and the presence of pml layers the solution of an @xmath0mode in our domain is slightly different , and a very small amount of power goes to the @xmath70 ridge .",

    "the variation of the phase shift with @xmath5 greatly differs from the one measured for the simulation , where in the two smaller radius cases we found that the phase shift is concentrated in the azimuthal orders @xmath173 with symmetric distribution , peaking at @xmath181 and @xmath40 , while the larger tube shows some significant phase shift in @xmath41 ( figure [ fig : phase ] ) .",
    "we consider a scenario which could explain this mismatch . we have tried to mimic the error introduced in the observational hankel decomposition by a displacement in the position of the annulus with respect to the magnetic element .",

    "as an example , consider a point source of waves which generates a concentric pattern of wavefronts that propagates radially outwards , like the one created by a pebble dropped into a pond .",
    "when the origin of the coordinate axis is located at the position where the pebble hits the water , the fourier - hankel analysis of the wave will reveal a large @xmath182 ( outgoing axisymmetric wave ) and zero @xmath183 ( no incoming power ) .",
    "however , at different positions the power will appear in different azimuthal orders . as stated above , the observed phase shift is retrieved from 3400 locations of small magnetic elements . if the resolution limitations and the movement of the magnetic element during the 4 hours of observation produce a slight shift in the determination of the center of the magnetic element , the average of the phase shift obtained from the 3400 elements , all of them with different displacement , will produce a broadening of the distribution of the phase shift with the azimuthal order .",
    "we have imitated this limitation by averaging the phase shift retrieved from 3400 realizations of the hankel analysis in the simulation with the 560 km radius tube , with the center of the annulus shifted randomly around the axis of the tube in a gaussian distribution with fwhm equal to that obtained from an estimation of the point spread function for mdi high - resolution data , which corresponds to 1.14 mm @xcite . in this analysis",

    "the scattering three realizations were performed , using different flux tube models .",

    "the oscillations of the tube produced by these waves generate a scattered wave .",
    "it is composed of a mixture of axisymmetric ( @xmath2 ) and dipolar ( @xmath97 ) modes , whose distribution in frequency and azimuthal order depends on the radius of the flux tube . for thin flux tubes ,",
    "the @xmath97 dipolar oscillation dominates the tube wave , while axisymmetric oscillations ( @xmath2 ) become important for larger tubes .",
    "this result agrees with those previously obtained by @xcite .",
    "we have quantified the absorption coefficient and phase shift produced by the three magnetic flux tube models . based on the results discussed in the previous section , we draw the following conclusions .",
    "firstly , the absorption increases with wavenumber ( frequency ) for all azimuthal orders and tube models .",
    "secondly , the amount of absorption in general increases with the magnetic flux of the tube , although this increase depends significantly on the wavenumber and azimuthal order .",
    "thirdly , the distribution of the absorption in azimuthal order depends on the radius of the tube . in all models",
    "the peak absorption is obtained for @xmath40 . however , in the tube with 170 km radius it is followed by @xmath2 , with a weak absorption in @xmath41 , while in the 370 km radius tube the absorption in @xmath41 is stronger than the corresponding to @xmath2 , and in the case of the 560 km radius tube the absorption in @xmath2 is especially low .",
    "the absorption of the axisymmetric @xmath2 order decreases with the radius .",
    "it is noticeable that the different behavior that the phase shift shows regarding the second and third points of the previous paragraph . from the simulations with the tubes we find a similar distribution in the phase shift produced in different azimuthal orders , although it seems to approximately scale with the magnetic flux , with some dependence on the @xmath9 value and the azimuthal order . in this way , @xmath2 and @xmath143 show a very similar phase shift , the later slightly higher in the two smaller tubes and the opposite in the larger tube , while the phase shift produced in @xmath41 is very small , except for the 560 km radius tube .    in this work",
    "we are not only interested in modeling the scattering process , but also in applying this knowledge to interpret observations .",
    "a deeper understanding of the wave interaction with small magnetic scatterers can yield a basis to infer the properties of the scattering elements , even at scales smaller than the observational resolution .",
    "we have compared the numerical results for the phase shift with observations of an ensemble averaging of thousands of small magnetic elements . in order to perform an equivalent comparison , the phase shift obtained from 3400 realizations of the hankel analysis of the simulations with the 560 km radius tube with a small shift in the position of the annulus",
    "was also averaged .    the phase shift produced by our larger tube model after averaging shows a good qualitative agreement with the observed phase shift .",
    "since the phase shift scales with the magnetic flux of the scattering element , we may consider that the phase shift of the observed elements could be produced by fluxtubes with magnetic flux around the corresponding to tubes with 560 km radius and 1600 g. the current work suggests one possible solution for the properties of the tube model , although other combinations of radius and magnetic field strength might also work .",
    "this kind of measurement seems to be a promising method to infer the characteristics of small magnetic networks elements .",
    "however , some caution must be considered in their interpretation .",
    "some of the observed magnetic elements used in this study show strong asymmetries ( see figure [ fig : magnetogram ] ) .",
    "when the scattering element is not axisymmetric the scattering is not restricted to occur from an azimuthal order @xmath5 to the same order @xmath5 , but the scatterred wave can correspond to a different order @xmath168 .",
    "these nonsymmetric elements could contribute to the broadening of the distribution of phase shift with @xmath5 .",
    "on the other hand , in the observed magnetograms it is hard to find enough completely isolated magnetic elements . from the 3400 elements used in the analysis , many of them present other small magnetic features inside the 16.5 mm annulus in which the hankel decomposition was performed .",
    "the observational analysis might be contaminated by the scattering produced by these other elements .    in the comparison between the observations and the simulations",
    ", we have assumed that the observational shift in the center of the hankel analysis is restricted to a gaussian with the fwhm of the psf from high - resolution mdi .",
    "if the proper motions of the flux tube have larger extension , the results could be affected .",
    "however , the tubes are presumably moving at the time scale of the granulation , which is not so different from the time scale of the wave period .",
    "this could mean that the approximation of a stationary tube is not so good , and limits the capacity of this work to address this issue .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the analysis to moving flux tubes in the future .",
    "these results provide a warning to be cautious when interpreting ensemble averages of observational data . in observations like those presented in this paper , where the contribution of an individual magnetic feature is too low to get a reliable measurement ,",
    "the average of several cases is a compulsory procedure to obtain a strong enough signal .",
    "however , the individual and unique characteristics of each element , together with the limitations to perform the analysis using exactly the same configuration , can lead to a result which may point to conclusions that do not reflect the real observed structure . in the particular case studied in this work , from the observational broad distribution of the phase shift with @xmath5",
    ", one could assume that a big magnetic feature is necessary to produce that dependence with the azimuthal order .",
    "the analysis of the averaged simulated flux tube reveals that a similar measure of the phase shift dependence can be retrieved from a very different magnetic element , making difficult infering an irrefutable conclusion about the nature of the observed elements .",
    "we thank tom duvall for providing observational data and for his helpful comments to an early version of this paper , and the referee for his / her valuable suggestions .",
