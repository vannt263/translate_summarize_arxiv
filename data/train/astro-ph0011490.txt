    "the old idea to detect neutrinos through horizontal air showers ( has ) @xcite has been recently brought to attention with the calculation of the acceptance of the auger observatories for the detection of high energy neutrinos @xcite . at large zenith angles , cosmic rays ( whether they are protons , heavier nuclei , or even photons ) develop ordinary showers in the top layers of the atmosphere in a very similar fashion to the well understood vertical showers .",
    "their electromagnetic component is however almost completely absorbed by the greatly enhanced atmospheric slant depth and prevented from reaching ground level . by contrast",
    ", high energy neutrinos may also induce horizontal air showers ( has ) deeper into the atmosphere and hence resemble vertical air showers in their particle content at ground level , provided they interact sufficiently close to an air shower array .",
    "the main background to neutrino induced has of very high energy ( in the eev range and above ) is expected to be due to the remaining muon component of the cosmic ray showers , after practically all the electromagnetic component is absorbed .",
    "a preliminary study of the air shower data at zenith angles above @xmath0 from the haverah park array has shown that the observed rate is consistent to that expected from the ultra high energy ( @xmath1  eev ) cosmic rays arriving at large zenith angles @xcite .",
    "these _ muon showers _ that penetrate the whole atmospheric slant depth to reach ground level are the object of this study which is intended to be detector independent .",
    "as the neutrino induced has rate that could be expected is quite low , zenith angle misreconstructions of vertical showers can also constitute a serious potential background to neutrino detection .",
    "however the relative importance of this background is very dependent on technical details of the experimental setup and , in particular , on the angular resolution actually achieved .",
    "thus these matters can not be further addressed in this article .",
    "the interest in has induced by ordinary cosmic rays is not just limited to understanding the background of neutrino induced showers .",
    "the measurement of high zenith angle showers would enhance the aperture of existing air shower array data and it would increase the data on cosmic ray arrival directions to previously inaccessible directions in galactic coordinates @xcite .",
    "besides these obvious advantages , high zenith angle cosmic ray showers are unique because they select the muon component of the showers and they naturally probe a region of phase space which is quite inaccessible from vertical air shower measurements : the shower core .",
    "the cosmic ray induced has are different mainly because they consist of muons which are produced far away from ground level .",
    "the particle density profiles for has induced by protons or heavy nuclei display complex muon patterns at the ground which result from the long path lengths travelled by the muons in the presence of the earth s magnetic field @xcite .",
    "these complex patterns are difficult to analyse @xcite because the conventional approaches used for interpretation of low zenith angle showers ( @xmath2 ) are usually based on the approximate circular symmetry of the density profiles .",
    "the analysis of has produced by cosmic rays requires a radically different approach .",
    "here we present a qualitative explanation of the ground muon patterns as well as analytical expressions for the muon density profile based on simple ideas .",
    "our approach agrees remarkably well with simulation results for a wide range of distances to the core and zenith angles between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "besides its convenience for data analysis which would otherwise depend on lengthy and cumbersome simulation results , the model gives a lot of insight into has and their complementarity to vertical showers and can be used for calculating the expected has rates for future detectors such as the auger observatories @xcite .",
    "we also briefly discuss a simple method involving rotations for approximately generating muon ground density profiles for any azimuthal incidence using a single shower of the same zenith angle .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ toy ]",
    "we present a toy model which describes the qualitative behavior of the ground muon patterns . in section [ geomag ]",
    "we discuss quite generally the implications of geomagnetic fields and the geometry implied . in section [ geotoy ]",
    "we extend the toy model to account for the magnetic field . in section [ param ]",
    "we give a detailed prescription to calculate muon densities for any azimuthal and zenith angle . in section [ asymmetries ]",
    "we discussed the asymmetries that arise at ground level and introduce a number of ways to account for them . in section [ results ] we compare the analytical densities obtained to those obtained with monte carlo simulations and finally in section [ summary ] we summarize the achievements , briefly enumerating possible applications .",
    "the number of electrons , positrons and photons , the electromagnetic component , in an air shower induced by a 10@xmath5 ev proton rises as the shower penetrates higher depths to reach a maximum after which it rapidly becomes absorbed by low energy processes and the photoelectric effect .",
    "this component behaves much like shower size ( number of electrons and positrons ) reaching its maximum typically at @xmath6  g  @xmath7 . below this depth",
    "it starts to become exponentially suppressed .",
    "the atmosphere is @xmath8 1000 g  @xmath7 deep for vertical showers doubling to @xmath8 2000 g  @xmath7 for 60@xmath9 and becoming over 30 times deeper for completely has at sea level so that the electromagnetic component from @xmath10 decay can be safely neglected at large zenith angles .    for inclined showers the main sources of electrons and photons at ground level are in fact the long range muons themselves , mainly through decay , but also through bremsstrahlung and pair production .",
    "the electron number density follows closely that of muons at all distances from shower axis and , as they are produced in small electromagnetic subshowers initiated by the decay electrons , their energy spectrum is very much like that expected in a vertical shower .",
    "a very similar argument applies to photons so that we can state that the total electromagnetic energy of an inclined shower is much less than the energy of the muonic component , unlike in vertical showers .",
    "as the zenith angle rises , the average length traversed by the shower muons from their production point to the ground increases from @xmath11 km for vertical showers to @xmath12  km for nearly horizontal ones ( see table  [ alturas ] ) . as a result",
    "only the muons produced with sufficiently high energy survive to ground level and this is crucial for has .",
    "typically the energy loss ranges from a few gev for the lowest energy muons in vertical showers to well over 100  gev for a completely horizontal shower . as a result the average energy of the muons at ground level varies by close to two orders of magnitude between vertical and horizontal showers , as shown in table  [ alturas ] .",
    "we now introduce a very simple toy model that reproduces some of the qualitative features of the muon density patterns on the ground .",
    "later we will build on this simple model to obtain parameterizations of muon densities at ground level .",
    "let us consider a shower of zenith angle @xmath13 and assume that there is no magnetic field .",
    "at ground level we calculate muon number densities in a plane perpendicular to the shower axis : _ the transverse plane_. in this plane the description of the shower becomes considerably simpler because it accurately respects the approximately cylindrical symmetry expected , except for minor effects due to changes in air density with height .",
    "this plane avoids the distortion of the muon densities resulting from the projection onto the earth surface .",
    "moreover , when the magnetic field is fully taken into account and the cylindrical symmetry is broken , as the azimuthal angle of the shower is rotated the muon density contours just rotate in the transverse plane remaining otherwise practically unchanged as will be shown below .",
    "we consider a highly relativistic muon of energy @xmath14 , and transverse momentum @xmath15 that travels a distance @xmath16 to reach the ground .",
    "we assume this muon will only be deviated due to the @xmath15 inherited from its parent pion ( kaon ) to arrive at distance @xmath17 to shower axis in the transverse plane .",
    "this is equivalent to neglecting multiple scattering and deviations of the pions themselves from shower axis . in this case",
    "@xmath17 is simply given by : @xmath18 this relation means that the muons of a given shower have distributions in @xmath19 , @xmath16 and @xmath15 which are not independent .",
    "for a given zenith @xmath13 the toy model is obtained taking an input energy distribution for the shower muons and fixing the values of @xmath16 and @xmath15 .",
    "the production distances @xmath16 of the shower muons reaching ground level have a distribution fixed by shower development with an average @xmath20 that rises as the zenith angle @xmath13 increases .",
    "as the development of inclined showers takes place in the upper layers of the atmosphere and spans only a small fraction of the atmosphere , the width of the @xmath16 distribution is small compared to @xmath20 .",
    "this means that taking @xmath16 to be a function of @xmath13 and ignoring its distribution can be a fairly good approximation . on the other hand the muon @xmath15 results from multiple pion interactions in the shower development and has a relatively broad distribution .",
    "this is one of the reasons that prevents the toy model from being valid at quantitative level as will be shown below .",
    "the virtue of this toy model is that it implies an approximately correct correlation between the muon energy , @xmath19 , and its deviation from shower axis , @xmath17 , through eq .",
    "( [ re ] ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the correlation between the average muon energy and @xmath17 as obtained in the simulation of one hundred @xmath21ev proton showers without magnetic field effects .",
    "such a relation means that at ground level the muon differential energy spectrum , @xmath22=dn / de$ ] , and the number density , @xmath23 , are related through : @xmath24 =            \\frac { c p_{\\perp } d}{2 \\pi r^3 } \\ ; \\phi \\left[e(r)\\right].\\ ] ] if for instance the energy spectrum of the shower muons is assumed to be @xmath25 the above relation implies : @xmath26 in the absence of a geomagnetic field the toy model can be adjusted to roughly reproduce monte carlo results .",
    "one can use a muon energy spectrum @xmath22=dn / de$ ] and @xmath16 as obtained in simulations and only needs to adjust a single parameter namely @xmath15 .",
    "we have done this exercise to obtain muon densities which are compared to aires simulations at different zenith angles . as an example fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] compares the results of simulation for three different zenith angles to density profile functions obtained with the toy model using the muon energy distributions from the simulations which are shown in fig .",
    "it is remarkable that such a crude model reproduces the muon lateral distributions to better than @xmath27 in the interval 20  m @xmath28 2  km with a single @xmath15 value of @xmath29mev for all zenith angles considered .",
    "the results are nevertheless only academic since in practice the ground density profiles are severely modified by the earth s magnetic field .",
    "to study the effect of the earth s magnetic field we choose to decompose the field @xmath30 in two components @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively parallel and perpendicular to shower axis .",
    "it is worth studying with a little detail the resulting geometry in the transverse plane since much of the ground pattern can be qualitatively understood in this way .",
    "we define two coordinate axes ( @xmath33 ) in this plane , such that @xmath34 is parallel to @xmath32 as shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] . in the transverse plane",
    "we define @xmath35 as the angle between the @xmath34 axis ( or equivalently @xmath32 ) and the direction parallel to the earth s surface .",
    "a muon travelling a distance @xmath16 from the production site to the ground will bend its trajectory in a direction perpendicular to its velocity , @xmath36 and to @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath37 is the component of @xmath30 perpendicular to @xmath36 .",
    "if the muons are almost parallel to shower axis @xmath37 largely coincides with @xmath32 and the transverse plane is perpendicular to the muon trajectory in this approximation .",
    "the parallel component of the earth s magnetic field @xmath31 can be neglected and neglecting other muon interactions and energy loss , the helicoidal trajectory is well approximated by an arc of a circle of radius @xmath38 in the plane containing shower axis and @xmath32 .    for a complete description of the deviations we only need @xmath32 or , equivalently , its intensity @xmath39 and the angle @xmath35 .",
    "the circular symmetry of the shower in the absence of magnetic fields is distorted depending on the projected magnetic field @xmath39 , the distance traversed by the muons , and their energy distribution . at low zenith the path length travelled is small and the circular patterns are hardly modified because the deviations are small .",
    "as the zenith rises the pattern turns first into an ellipsoid which eventually becomes two lobes at each side of @xmath39 corresponding to the negative and positive charge muons deviating in opposite directions .    for a fixed zenith angle",
    "the density pattern in the transverse plane depends only on the intensity of the magnetic field .",
    "the pattern is oriented according to the direction of @xmath32 . both the magnitude and direction of @xmath32",
    "depend on the azimuthal angle of the shower @xmath40 . in this article azimuthal angles",
    "are measured counterclockwise with respect to the magnetic north .",
    "[ bmod ] and [ bpsi ] respectively show how both these quantities vary as the azimuthal angle takes all possible values at two different locations , corresponding to haverah park @xcite and pampa amarilla ( the southern hemisphere auger observatory ) @xcite for illustrative purposes . on the basis of these two graphs alone and the discussion that follows it is straightforward to conclude that the muon density patterns in these sites will be completely different .",
    "a detailed study of has in pampa amarilla will be published elsewhere .    as the shower azimuthal angle varies at the haverah park site , @xmath39 oscillates in magnitude about a central value .",
    "the oscillation amplitude decreases as the zenith angle rises being @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) of the central value for @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) zenith .",
    "it is remarkable that for this location once the zenith angle @xmath13 is fixed at a high value , @xmath39 is not too sensitive to the azimuthal direction of the shower @xmath40 . on the other hand",
    "as the zenith angle decreases the length transversed by the muons @xmath16 becomes much smaller and the magnetic field is less effective in modifying the ground density profiles . while for low zenith the magnetic effect is small and there is little need for considering it , for high zenith @xmath39 can be regarded as approximately independent of azimuth .",
    "this means that we can make use of the fact that @xmath39 is approximately azimuth independent to quickly generate has from a single simulation .",
    "if we fix the zenith angle to a high value , we make the approximation that @xmath39 is constant and let the azimuth angle vary , the variations of the shower densities at ground level are only due to the corresponding changes in the angle @xmath35 . in this approximation",
    "different azimuths are equivalent to a pattern rotation in the transverse plane .",
    "this approximation has important practical implications as it means that , given the zenith angle , a single shower can be used to generate muon density profiles on the ground for all azimuthal angles with the appropriate rotations of @xmath45 and projections onto the plane corresponding to the earth s surface .",
    "this alone represents an important tool that can help the analysis of high energy has and has already been successfully used in the analysis of haverah park data presented in @xcite .",
    "we have tested this economical means for generating has in a very simple fashion .",
    "we have generated approximate showers of predetermined azimuths from the results of a single shower .",
    "the ground level muon number density contours obtained in this way have been compared with the results of a direct simulations for the corresponding rotated azimuths . for the haverah park site as an example",
    "we have obtained approximate proton showers at @xmath46 and @xmath47 from the monte carlo results of a shower at @xmath48 for three different zenith angles : @xmath49 .",
    "the rotated showers agree rather well with simulation results .",
    "indeed fluctuations from shower to shower and the uncertainties introduced by thinning are much larger than the error made in the constant @xmath39 approximation . at extreme zeniths ( @xmath50 )",
    "however the separated lobes on the ground plane obtained with simulations are slightly asymmetric .",
    "clearly rotation in the transverse plane and simple projection onto the ground can not generate these asymmetries .",
    "these asymmetries arise because at high zeniths most of the muon deviation is due to the magnetic field and linear projection becomes inadequate . they can be taken into account as will be further discussed in section [ asymmetries ] .",
    "the distinction between the two parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 made in section [ toy ] is important for considering geomagnetic field effects separately .",
    "we quantify the magnetic deviation through @xmath51 , the distance between the intersections of the two muon trajectories with and without magnetic effects and the transverse plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ symmetry ] .",
    "note that the coordinates @xmath33 are conveniently chosen in the perpendicular and parallel directions to @xmath32 .",
    "the geomagnetic deviation of the muons is easily shown to be : @xmath52   \\simeq \\frac { d^2 } { 2 r } = \\frac{e b_{\\perp } d^2}{2p } , \\label{deltax}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the electron charge , @xmath38 is the radius of curvature , and @xmath54 is the muon momentum and we have expanded brackets to first order in @xmath55 . for @xmath51 less than 2",
    "km we expect it to be valid at the @xmath56 level at zenith @xmath57 because the typical production distance @xmath20 is 16  km . at higher",
    "zenith the approximation is excellent . when we combine the above relation with eq .",
    "[ re ] we obtain the following expression : @xmath58 where in the last equation @xmath59 is to be expressed in tesla , @xmath16 in m and @xmath15 in gev .",
    "physically @xmath60 ( given by eq .",
    "[ re ] ) corresponds to the muon deviation in the transverse plane _ in the absence of magnetic field_. when @xmath60 and @xmath51 are small compared to @xmath16 we can add them as two dimensional vectors in this plane .",
    "we can gain some insight in this relation considering that all muons ( that for @xmath61 would intersect the transverse plane at a distance @xmath60 to the shower axis ) are further deviated by @xmath62 a distance proportional to @xmath60 in the direction perpendicular to @xmath32 as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ symmetry ] .",
    "the @xmath63 and @xmath64 deviate in opposite senses so that the projection of the geomagnetic field in the transverse plane introduces a kind of mirror symmetry axis .",
    "we expect that the symmetry will not be exact being modulated by the expected excess of @xmath63 respect to @xmath64 in atmospheric showers @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath65 measures the ratio of the two described components of the displacement in the transverse plane , that due to the transverse momentum and that due to the magnetic field .",
    "technically we can obtain the muon number density in the transverse plane in this model making the transformation : @xmath66 here the barred ( unbarred ) coordinates represent the position of the muon in the transverse plane in the absence ( presence ) of the earth s magnetic field .",
    "the muon number density is then : @xmath67 , \\label{rhotoy}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the density at distance @xmath69 in the case @xmath61 and the last factor in brackets is the jacobian of the transformation .",
    "we have checked that the above equations reproduce the main features observed in the muon density profiles in the transverse plane with magnetic fields .",
    "the muon number densities at ground level can be obtained after an appropriate projection onto the plane of the earth s surface .",
    "the value of @xmath65 is a measure of the importance of the magnetic field .",
    "for instance for vertical showers we can plausibly set the distance to production to @xmath70  km , @xmath71 t , and @xmath72  gev , which gives @xmath73 ; _ i.e. _ @xmath65 is very small and the effect of the magnetic field is not very important for vertical showers . for horizontal showers , however , @xmath16 can be as large as @xmath74 km and @xmath75 t , making @xmath76 . for large values of @xmath65",
    "we expect that the density profiles obtained with @xmath61 are strongly modified .",
    "it can be shown that if @xmath77 all @xmath63 and @xmath64 are confined to a region in the transverse plane limited by two straight lines as illustrated in fig .",
    "the figure has been obtained with eq .",
    "[ rhotoy ] , @xmath78 and using a standard parameterization for the lateral muon distribution : @xmath79 with @xmath80 km .",
    "this result is qualitatively very important because it implies that for large zenith angles we expect _ void regions _ or _ shadows _ in which no muons are expected .",
    "the angle subtended by these voids is dependent on the parameter @xmath65 , physically on the zenith angle .",
    "the effect can be easily explained with a geometrical construction matching the textbook graph for explaining the cherenkov effect , see fig .",
    "[ cherenkov ] .",
    "the existence of these shadows is indeed the case as observed in simulations ( see next section ) and can be used for distinguishing between has produced by protons or nuclei high in the atmosphere and those produced by deeply penetrating neutrinos .",
    "these results are only valid at a qualitative level and hence the actual function used for @xmath81 is not relevant .",
    "further steps are needed to transform the toy model into a valid parameterization as shown below .",
    "one of the reasons that has difficulted the study of has in particle array experiments is their intricate density profiles and their azimuthal dependence .",
    "experiments with good sensitivity to particles incident at high zenith angles such as the haverah park array did not have data from many stations that allowed the study of these effects from the experimental data . from the discussion of the previous section it is clear that the expected asymmetries due to the geomagnetic field depend on the value of the projection of @xmath30 onto the transverse plane .",
    "this projection obviously differs depending on the location of the experiment . for the purpose of checking the validity of the parameterizations that we present here , we have selected as an example the field corresponding to the haverah park array site , which has a value of @xmath82 t , declination of @xmath83 and inclination of @xmath84 .",
    "unfortunately the toy model presented in the previous section is not good enough for quantitative purposes .",
    "the actual situation is more complicated even when @xmath61 because the transverse position of the muon , @xmath60 , is affected by both multiple scattering and the transverse position of the parent pions .",
    "nevertheless the simple relation provided by eq .  [ re ] manifests a true correlation between @xmath60 and @xmath19 which can be easily checked through simulation .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows how the _ average _ muon energy , @xmath85 , is clearly inversely related to distance from the shower axis @xmath60 as obtained in aires simulated proton showers at zenith angles @xmath3 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    ". we will now show how a relatively simple extension of the toy model converts it into a quantitatively valid parameterization of the muon component in has induced by cosmic rays .",
    "the quantitative model proposed still makes use of eq .",
    "[ re ] , keeping @xmath16 constant but assuming that at a given @xmath60 there is an energy distribution .",

    "the correlation can be approximated : @xmath89 for all zenith angles above @xmath3 @xmath90 ranges between 0.73 and 0.83 ( see table  [ edfparam ] and fig .  [ epsilonfit ] ) .",
    "simulations show that as the transverse distance to the shower axis ( @xmath60 ) increases the width of the @xmath91 distribution at fixed @xmath60 varies slowly as shown in fig .",

    "the distribution is normalized to 1 so that @xmath98 is recovered after integration in @xmath91 .    to obtain the muon number density in the presence of the magnetic field we now have to perform the same transformation : @xmath99 note that this only differs subtly from eq .",

    "a simple helix would only neglect muon energy loss and decay and some correction can be further implemented to account them . for a purely geometrical extrapolation we will use the following procedure which is shown to be sufficient for all purposes . in the direction parallel to @xmath39 one",
    "simple joins the muon position to the fixed production point while in the orthogonal direction one considers muon trajectories which are circles tangent to shower axis at the same production point . in figs .",
    "[ asymcontour ] and in fig .",
    "[ mupluminus ] the results of the rectangular projection are compared to the extrapolation of the simulated densities for a shower at extreme zenith @xmath107 and having azimuth @xmath108 ( maximum asymmetry ) . a large fraction of the unwanted asymmetries in the transverse plane is equivalently removed with either of the two methods .",
    "the residual asymmetries are mostly due to muon decay and the neglect of muon energy loss . for distances to shower core below @xmath109",
    "km the residual asymmetry is below @xmath110 ; it should be stressed that this range corresponds to distances up to 80  km away from shower core in the ground plane .    in the analytical results obtained for the muon densities in the transverse plane ( previous section ) the information on",
    "the individual muon energy and direction is lost .",
    "fortunately the geometrical algorithm to remove the asymmetries can be inverted to convert the symmetric results obtained in our model to the ground , approximately reproducing the asymmetries , what makes it appropriate for comparison with data to the precision level indicated by these graphs .",
    "the systematic error in the ground projection that would be generated at large @xmath17 could be largely removed accounting for asymmetries due to energy loss and muon decay .",
    "testing the muon number density results obtained with the prescription described in the previous section by comparison with dedicated simulations is by no means a straightforward task .",
    "the main difficulty arises from the uncertainties associated with the muon densities on the ground plane that are obtained with any simulation program which necessarily implies the statistical treatment of shower particles , _ thinning algorithms _",
    ", for the energies considered to avoid excessive computing times .",
    "there is a complex combination of statistical fluctuations , shower fluctuations and thinning fluctuations which is rather difficult to unravel .",
    "the simulated muon number density results fluctuate depending on the two dimensional binning choices which are rather awkward to choose because of the complexity of the patterns involved particularly at the highest zenith angles .    for testing purposes , we choose to compare the densities obtained with the described prescription to the results of simulations using aires @xcite with the magnetic effects on .",
    "we have also generated 100 proton showers of energy @xmath21ev and azimuths @xmath48 and @xmath4 for each zenith angle ( @xmath3 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath104 ) .",
    "we project the average muon densities ( over the 100 showers ) onto the transverse plane as described in the previous section to eliminate the asymmetries and to compare to the results of our model .    the number density results of eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) are compared to the averages obtained with the specific simulations made .",
    "no normalization has been made in the comparisons shown in figs .",
    "[ contour80][yslices ] that illustrate the reach of our results .",
    "the figures shown very much speak on their own .",
    "the agreement is rather impressive considering the ranges of distances involved and particularly the ranges in densities which can span over four orders of magnitude .",
    "we firstly show in figs .",
    "[ contour80 ] and [ contour87 ] two density contour plots for two different zeniths .",
    "these graphs display well defined shadow regions as anticipated and show an excellent agreement in the shape of the densities obtained compared to the simulation results .",
    "the isolated density spots in the simulation also indicate very clearly how the fluctuations due to the simulation become very important even at distances very close to shower axis in some specific directions .",
    "the figures even suggest that in many respects the parameterization results are ",
    "better behaved  in the sense that they avoid many unphysical fluctuations and can be extrapolated to very low muon densities .",
    "quantitative tests of the average two dimensional density distribution in polar coordinates integrated over the radial ( azimuthal ) coordinate up to 6  km ( up to @xmath111 ) in the transverse plane are shown in fig .",
    "[ phiint ] ( fig .",
    "[ rint ] ) .",
    "the bars are indicative of the statistical errors in the obtained averages taking into account shower fluctuations and poisson statistics .",
    "these graphs are particularly good for stressing systematic effects that are cumulative and highlight the discrepancies .",
    "the disagreement is largest for the highest values of @xmath17 so that the highest discrepancies correspond to low muon number densities where results are going to be less relevant . as stressed before some of the differences between the model and the simulation are due to muon decay and are thus still an artifact of using results on the ground plane for comparison with our analytical muon number densities .",
    "they are nevertheless indicative of the uncertainties that can be expected if geometrical projections are used for obtaining densities at ground level ignoring muon decay .",
    "these are below statistical fluctuations and consequently quite hidden by shower fluctuations .",
    "lastly , fig .",
    "[ xslices ] shows the @xmath100 distribution calculated in a 40  meter bin centered at @xmath112 while fig .  [ yslices ]",
    "shows the @xmath34 distribution for a 40  meter bin centered at @xmath113 km .",
    "although for the highest zenith ( @xmath104 ) the @xmath17 distributions disagree above the @xmath114 level for @xmath17 distances exceeding 4  km in the transverse plane , the discrepancies in the actual densities correspond to very low values of the densities which are relatively less important .",
    "we have successfully obtained a framework for studying the muon content of has produced by protons in the atmosphere .",
    "it can be effectively considered as a semianalytical parameterization for the muon number densities in the transverse plane for has .",
    "although it relies on monte carlo it can be considered as an alternative to it since the simulation is only needed in first instance to obtain the inputs ignoring the magnetic effects and hence eliminating azimuthal angle dependences .",
    "although only proton showers of @xmath21ev energy have been considered for the haverah park site , this framework is completely general and can be applied to showers of any energy and composition located in any site in a completely analogous fashion .",
    "the method consists of splitting the muon propagation in a shower into two fictitious parts , one which takes place in the absence of a magnetic field and a second one in which the magnetic effects are separately analysed . as the first part preserves the approximate circular symmetry of the shower development it allows simple parameterizations in terms of a single variable .",
    "the second part can be implemented in an analytical way . as a spinoff",
    "we have obtained a way to obtain ground density profiles of fixed zenith angle but any azimuthal angle from a single shower of the corresponding zenith .",
    "we expect to refine this model by improving the fits for the required inputs and including ignored effects such as correlations between muon impact position and distance to production site , muon decay , and distributions of distance to production site .",
    "these ignored effects could be implemented in an analogous way to the introduction of the energy distribution .",
    "although these refinements may be necessary in the future , we do not feel at this time there is need to be so accurate since there are many uncertainties in the simulation programs which surely exceed the precision level of the results obtained .",
    "the simulations used require extrapolations of cross sections and distributions of particle interactions in energy regions which are well above those explored in current particle physics experiments or those to be made in the near future .    besides giving insight into the complexity of large zenith angle showers , the results presented here have a rather broad range of applications connected with the detection of horizontal air showers .",
    "the need of systematic simulations of complicated high energy showers which is very time consuming can be avoided .",
    "such a task is of great help for the analysis of large zenith angle data as well as for the study of the sensitivity of these air showers to any of the current concerns about the highest energy cosmic rays such as the expected acceptance of pierre auger observatories @xcite .",
