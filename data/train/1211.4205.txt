    "the bifurcation splits into two first - order metamagnetic transitions at critical magnetic field values @xmath8 t and @xmath9 t @xcite .",
    "conventionally , a phase that emerges at fields @xmath10 and temperatures @xmath11 k is identified as a nematic one @xcite .",
    "this phase breaks the discrete square lattice rotational symmetry , as witnessed by a large magnetoresistive anisotropy in the @xmath4 plane as the magnetic field @xmath2 is rotated away from the @xmath5 axis toward the @xmath4 plane @xcite .",

    "the obtained agreement with the experimental phase diagram is robust and does not depend on the nature of the ordered phase for our analysis is based on the thermodynamic consideration .",
    "we show that it is the flat band that generates both the entropy peak and the resistivity jumps at the qcps .",
    "we reveal the nature of quantum critical points ( qcps ) as associated with the fermion condensation quantum phase transition ( fcqpt ) @xcite , and demonstrate that these steep jumps are represented by jumps of irregular residual resistivity @xmath14 due to the presence of flat band , generated by fcqpt and leading to fermion condensation ( fc ) , rather than by the ordered phase itself .",
    "the same qcps make the entropy within the ordered phase form a peak and produce a scaling behavior of the thermodynamic functions strongly resembling that of hf metals .",
    "the magnetoresistivity @xmath15 as a function of field and temperature is frequently approximated by the formula @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the correction to the resistivity produced by the field @xmath2 and @xmath18 is a @xmath19-independent coefficient .",

    "we conclude that it is @xmath14 that are responsible for the observed behavior of @xmath37 .",
    "let us assess possible causes for the jumps .",
    "when considering spin - orbit coupling in disordered electron systems where electron motion is diffusive , the residual resistivity may have both positive ( weak localization ) and negative ( weak anti - localization ) signs @xcite .",
    "however , since @xmath0 exhibits successive upward and downward jumps separated by the narrow range of magnetic fields @xmath48 , it is unclear how weak localization at @xmath33 is changed to weak anti - localization at @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 is one of the purest metals and the applicable regime of electron motion is ballistic rather than diffusive .",
    "therefore , both weak and anti - weak localization scenarios are irrelevant .",
    "accordingly , one expects the @xmath2-dependent correction @xmath17 to the residual resistivity to be positive and small .",
    "as we have seen , this is far from the case .",
    "proposals for the origin of the jumps at finite temperatures may invoke band electrons close to a van hove singularity ( vhs ) , giving rise to the ordered phase @xcite",
    ". however , such scenarios must be rejected , since the electrons involved must have very large effective mass @xmath49 and hence contribute only weakly to transport properties at finite temperatures and not at all at @xmath50 , see e.g. ref . .",
    "another possible source of the observed jumps might be resistivity associated with nematic domains that are thought to exist at @xmath51 for the fields tuning the system to a vhs @xcite .",
    "the jumps would be due to the extra scattering produced by such domains .",
    "this scenario is also problematic , since the domains would have to be present at least in the normal phase and at temperatures as high as @xmath52 k , while the critical temperature for formation of both the nematic phase and the domains is estimated as @xmath53 k @xcite .",
    "failing such conventional explanations , we are faced with a challenging task that may well have broad implications for our understanding of unorthodox ( notably , nfl ) phenomena condensed - matter systems : how does one unveil the qcps that create the quantum critical regime of @xmath0 , giving rise to the emergence of jumps in the resistivity @xmath14 and generating the entropy peak ?",
    "in order to develop viable explanations of the resistivity jumps and entropy excess , it is necessary to recall the origin , nature , and consequences of _ flattening _ of single - particle excitation spectra @xmath54 ( `` flat bands '' ) in strongly correlated fermi systems  also called swelling of the fermi surface or fc @xcite ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) . at @xmath50 , the ground state of a system with a flat band",
    "is degenerate , and the occupation numbers @xmath55 of single - particle states belonging to the flat band are continuous functions of momentum @xmath56 , in contrast to discrete standard lfl values 0 and 1",
    ". such behavior of the occupation numbers leads to a @xmath19-independent entropy term @xmath57 \\label{s0}\\ ] ] that does not contribute to the specific heat @xmath58 . unlike the corresponding lfl entropy , which vanishes linearly as @xmath32 , the term @xmath59 produces a @xmath19-independent thermal expansion coefficient @xcite .",
    "that @xmath19-independent behavior is observed in measurements on @xmath60 @xcite and @xmath61 @xcite , while very recent measurements on @xmath0 indicate the same behavior @xcite and confirm the existence of flat bands @xcite . in the theory of fermion condensation",
    ", the degeneracy of the nfl ground state is removed at any finite temperature , since the flat band acquires a small dispersion @xcite @xmath62 proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "the occupation numbers @xmath63 of fc remain unchanged at relatively low temperatures and , accordingly , so does the entropy @xmath59 .",
    "we now introduce these concepts to achieve a coherent picture of the quantum critical regime underlying the jump phenomena in @xmath13 . in constructing a",
    "field - induced flat band , we employ the model @xcite based on a vhs that induces a peak in the single - particle density of states ( dos ) and sharp rise of @xmath7 as the field sweeps across the metamagnetic transition . upon increase of an applied magnetic field @xmath2 , the vhs is moved through the fermi energy . at fields in the range",
    "@xmath10 the dos peak turns out to be at or near the fermi energy .",
    "a key point in this scenario is that within the range @xmath10 , a relatively weak repulsive interaction ( e.g. , coulomb ) is sufficient to induce fc and formation of a flat band with the corresponding dos singularity locked in the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "now , it is seen from eq . that finite temperatures , while removing the degeneracy of the fc spectrum , do not change @xmath59 , threatening the violation of the nernst theorem . to avoid such an entropic singularity , the fc state must be altered as @xmath32 , so that the excess entropy @xmath59 is shed before zero temperature is reached .",
    "this can take place by means of some phase transition or crossover , whose explicit consideration is beyond the scope of this paper .    .",
    "the qcps situated at the critical magnetic fields @xmath33 and @xmath34 are indicated by arrows .",
    "the fermion condensation ( fc ) or flat band is present between these qcps as depicted by the double - headed arrow .",

    "the schematic @xmath1 phase diagram of @xmath0 inferred from the proposed scenario is presented in fig .",
    "its main feature is the magnetic field - induced quantum critical domain created by qcps situated at @xmath33 and @xmath34 and supporting a fc and associated flat band induced by a vhs ( double - headed arrow between black dots ) . the low - field [ high - field ] qcp on the left [ right ] augurs the emergence of the flat band as @xmath66 [ @xmath67 from below [ above ] .",
    "in contrast to the typical phase diagram of a hf metal @xcite , the domain occupied by the ordered phase in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is seen to be approximately symmetric with respect to the magnetic field @xmath68 .",
    "the emergent fc and qcps are considered to be hidden or concealed in a phase transition , which is driven by the need for the system to avoid the entropic singularity that would be produced at @xmath32 by the @xmath19-independent entropy term @xmath59 of eq . .",
    "the area occupied by this phase transition is indicated by horizontal lines and restricted by boundary lines ( `` sidewalls '' and `` roof '' ) . at the critical temperature @xmath69",
    "where the new ( ordered ) phase sets in , the entropy is a continuous function .",
    "therefore the `` roof '' of the domain occupied by the new phase is a line of second - order phase transitions .",
    "as @xmath19 is lowered , some temperature @xmath64 is reached at which the entropy of the ordered phase becomes larger than that of the adjacent disordered phase , due to the remnant entropy @xmath59 from the highly entropic flat - band state that is present above @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , under the influence of the magnetic field , the system undergoes a first - order phase transition upon crossing a sidewall boundary at @xmath70 , since entropy can not be equalized there .",
    "it follows , then , that the line of second - order phase transitions is changed to a line of first - order transitions at tricritical points indicated by arrows in fig .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the sidewall boundary lines are not strictly vertical , due to the stated behavior of the entropy at the boundary and as a consequence of the magnetic clausius - clapeyron relation @xcite .",
    "indeed , in our case the clausius - clapeyron equation reads , @xmath71 here , @xmath72 is the permeability constant and @xmath73 stands for @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the beauty of eq .",
    "is that it defines the slope of the boundary lines shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] from the first principles of thermodynamics .",
    "since the entropy @xmath74 within the bounded region is higher than that outside , the slopes of the phase boundaries point outwards as shown in fig .",
    "we conclude that the phase diagram [ fig2 ] is in good agreement with the experimental one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , panel * a*. we note that the obtained agreement is robust and does not depend on the nature of the ordered phase for our analysis is based on the thermodynamic consideration .",
    "for example , such a consideration allows one to establish the @xmath1 phase diagram of the hf metal @xmath60 that resembles that of @xmath0 @xcite .    on each flank of the region occupied by",
    "the ordered ( nematic ) phase , the system crosses over from the lfl state prevailing at the lowest temperatures to a nfl state under rising temperature .",
    "the total width @xmath75 of the nfl state and crossover ( `` cross '' ) region on either flank ( denoted with a double arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , is proportional to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath75 inferred from this phase diagram is also reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] * b * , which depicts the dependence of the function @xmath26 on field strength and temperature . since the width @xmath75 vanishes when the magnetic field tends to its critical values , @xmath26 is represented by the two steep sidewalls seen in panel * b * of fig .  [ fig1 ] as the critical field values @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "are respectively approached from below and above .",
    "we turn next to calculations of the resistivity @xmath37 in the range @xmath10 , the dispersion of the flat band being governed by eq . .",
    "the electronic liquid of @xmath0 is described by several bands occupied by normal quasiparticles that simultaneously intersect the fermi surface , along with heavy quasiparticles whose dispersion never covers the entire fermi surface @xcite .",
    "based on eq .",
    ", the temperature dependence of the effective mass @xmath76 of the fc quasiparticles is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is determined by the characteristic size @xmath79 of the momentum domain occupied by the fc and @xmath80 is the fermi momentum @xcite . from this relation",
    "it follows that the effective mass of fc quasiparticles diverges at low temperatures , while their group velocity , and hence their current , vanishes .",
    "therefore the main contribution to the resistivity is provided by normal quasiparticles outside the fc having non - divergent effective mass @xmath81 and finite group velocity at @xmath32 .",
    "nonetheless , it will be seen that fc quasiparticles still play a key role in determining the behavior of the irregular residual resistivity in the range @xmath10 .",
    "the resistivity has the conventional dependence @xcite",
    "@xmath82 on the effective mass @xmath83 and damping @xmath84 of the normal quasiparticles . based on the relation ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath84 is obtained in closed form in the present context as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a constant @xcite .",
    "it is seen from eq . that the coefficient @xmath18 on the right hand side of eq",
    ". is partly formed by fc .",
    "we call this contribution to @xmath18 , coming from fc , @xmath87 .",
    "we consider now additional contribution @xmath88 to the the @xmath19-linear resistivity , formed by the zero sound generated by the presence of fc @xcite .",
    "the system with fc possesses its own set of zero - sound modes .",
    "the mode of interest for our analysis contributes to the @xmath19-linear dependence of the resistivity , as the conventional sound mode does in the case of normal metals @xcite .",
    "the mode is that of transverse zero sound with its @xmath19-dependent sound velocity @xmath89 and the debye temperature @xcite @xmath90 here , @xmath91 is a factor , @xmath92 is the effective mass of electron formed by vhs , @xmath93 is the fermi temperature , while @xmath49 on the left hand side of eq . is the effective mass formed finally by some interaction ,",
    "e.g. the coulomb interaction , generating flat bands @xcite .",
    "the characteristic wave number @xmath94 of the soft transverse zero - sound mode is estimated as @xmath95 since we assume that the main contribution forming the flat band comes from vhs .",
    "we note that the numerical factor @xmath91 can not be established and is considered as a fitting parameter , correspondingly , making @xmath96 given by eq .",
    "estimating @xmath97 k and taking @xmath98 , and observing that the quasi - classical regime takes place at @xmath99 , we obtain that @xmath100 k and expect that strongly correlated fermi systems can exhibit a quasi - classical behavior with the low - temperature coefficient @xmath18 , entering eq . , @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "thus , in hf metals with their few bands crossing fermi level and populated by lfl quasiparticles and by hf quasiparticles , the transverse zero sound make the resistivity possess the @xmath19-linear dependence at the quantum criticality as the normal sound ( or phonons ) do in the case of ordinary metals , while fc adds the quantum contribution @xmath87 to the coefficient @xmath18 @xcite .",

    ", the fc makes all quasiparticles possess the same unique width @xmath84 and lifetime @xmath102 . as we shall see , the @xmath19-independent width @xmath86 forms the irregular residual resistivity @xmath14 .",
    "using relations , and together with the standard treatment of vertex corrections @xcite , we are led to conclude that the resistivity of @xmath0 should behave as @xmath107 in the thermodynamic regime in question .",
    "the term `` residual resistivity '' ordinarily refers to impurity scattering . in the present case , as seen from eqs . and",
    ", the irregular residual resistivity @xmath108 is instead determined by the onset of a flat band , and has no relation to scattering of quasiparticles by impurities .",
    "since the fc and the flat band manifest themselves on in the region @xmath10 , it is natural also to conclude that the qcps indicated in fig .",

    "this behavior of the maximum is in accord with the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , since the width @xmath75 increases linearly with @xmath19 and the maximum located in the transition region shifts toward zero temperature , while the effective mass @xmath132 given by eq . diverges as @xmath2 approaches the critical field . to expose the scaling behavior , we normalize the measured @xmath119 values to @xmath133 and the corresponding temperatures @xmath19 to @xmath134 , @xmath135 , by dividing by their values @xmath123 and @xmath122 at the maxima @xcite .",

    "all the normalized @xmath138 and @xmath139 curves are to merge into a single one , @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the normalized effective mass represented by a universal function , being a solution of the landau equation @xcite .",
    "this solution @xmath142 can be well approximated by a simple universal interpolating function .",

    "the hf metals and @xmath13 are seen to exhibit the same scaling behavior , which can be understood within the framework of fermion condensation or flat - band theory @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have unveiled a challenging connection between @xmath13 and heavy - fermion metals by establishing universal physics that straddles across the corresponding microscopic details .",
    "our construction of the @xmath1 phase diagram of @xmath13 has permitted us to explain main features of the experimental one , and unambiguously implies an interpretation of its extraordinary low - temperature thermodynamic in terms of fermion condensation quantum phase transition leading to the formation of a flat band at the restricted range of magnetic fields @xmath148 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the obtained agreement with the experimental phase diagram is robust and does not depend on the nature of the ordered phase , for our analysis is based on the thermodynamic consideration .",
