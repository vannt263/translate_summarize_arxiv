    "the diffractive scattering is a process where the colliding particles scatter at very small angles and without any color flux in the final state .",
    "this involves a propagator carrying the vacuum quantum numbers , called pomeron and described , in the soft regime , within the regge theory .",
    "since the first operation period in 1992 , zeus and h1 , the two experiments dedicated to the dis physics at hera , observed that a big amount @xmath8 of lepton - proton dis events had a diffractive origin opening a new area of studies in diffractive production mechanism , providing a hard scale which can be varied over a wide range and therefore it is an ideal testing for qcd models .",
    "in particular , the diffractive production of vector mesons ( vms ) and real photons in @xmath0 collisions allows to study the transition from the soft to the hard regime in strong interactions . the hard regime ( high energy and low bjorken-@xmath9 )",
    "is dominated by the exchange of a hard pomeron sensitive to the gluon content and well described by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , while in the soft regime ( low-@xmath9 ) the interaction is well described within the regge phenomenology .",
    "indicating with @xmath10 the virtuality of the exchanged photon and with @xmath11 the square mass of the produced vm , hera data suggested a universal hard scale , @xmath12 , for the diffractive exclusive pruduction of vms and real photons , which indicates the transition from the soft to the hard regime .",
    "a new precision measurement of the reaction @xmath14 was published by zeus  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the cross section falls steeply with the increasing of @xmath10 but , unlike it was observed for the @xmath15 electroproduction  @xcite , it can not be described by a simple propagator term like @xmath16 , in particular an @xmath17 value increasing with @xmath10 appears to be favored .",
    "figure  [ q2_rho ] reports the cross section for the @xmath18 electroproduction versus @xmath10 compared with several theoretical predictions : the kwm model  @xcite based on the saturation model , the fss model  @xcite with and without saturation and the df model  @xcite .",
    "none of the available models gives a good description of the data over the full kinematic range of the measurement .",
    "cross section as a function of @xmath10 measured at @xmath19 and comared in ( a ) and ( b ) with different models as described in the text .",
    "[ q2_rho],scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the soft to hard transition can be observed looking at the dependence of the vms photoproduction ( @xmath20 ) cross section from the @xmath21 centre of mass energy , @xmath13 , where the scale is provided by @xmath11 .",
    "figure  [ w_php ] collects the @xmath22 as a function of @xmath13 from the lightest vector meson , @xmath18 , to the heaviest , @xmath23 , compared to the total cross section .",
    "dependence of the cross section for exclusive vm photoproduction together with the total photoproduction cross section .",
    "lines are the result of a @xmath24 fit to the data at high @xmath13-energy values .",
    "[ w_php],scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the cross section rises with the energy as @xmath24 , where the @xmath25 exponent increases with the hard scale @xmath11 as expected for a transition from the soft to the hard regime .",
    "new results on the @xmath23 photoproduction  @xcite , recently published by zeus , confirmed the steeper rise of @xmath26 for higher vector meson masses .    the transition from the soft to the hard regime",
    "can also be studied varying @xmath10 .",
    "recent results were achieved by h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite for the exclusive production of a real photon , the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , where the hard scale is provided only by the photon virtuality , @xmath10 .",
    "figure  [ w_dvcs ] shows the h1 ( left ) and the zeus ( right ) results .",
    "the steep rise with @xmath13 of the cross section even at low-@xmath10 , seems to suggest that the most sensitive part to the soft scale comes from the wave function of the pruduced vm .",
    "a similar result was obtained for the @xmath15 electroproduction  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the fit of @xmath27 was performed with all the parameters fixed excepted for the normalisation .",
    "the model does not agree with the h1 measurements ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_new]c ) but it is compatible with the new zeus preliminary results ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fit_new]d ) .",
    "the @xmath28 variable was calculated in h1 by the transverse four - momenta of the scattered electron and the real photon , using the apprroximation @xmath29 , while in zeus a particular silicon microstrips spectrometer , based on the roman pots technique , was used in order to have a direct measurement of the scattered proton momentum @xmath30 and then @xmath28 being calculated from the quantity : @xmath31 , by the phormula : @xmath32 .",
    "the really low acceptance of this spectrometer is the reason of the poor statistics of the zeus data , howewer it offers a really pure selection of diffractive events , not affected by any not - diffractive background .",
    "the agreement with the zeus preliminary measurements encourages us to be still confident in our predictions , till they will be checked by the new hera data analyses ( now in progress with and without roman pots spectrometer ) .    the slope of @xmath27 , calculated according to eq",

    "* after the shut - down of the hera collider , the zeus and h1 experiments have left a huge heritage of experimental results on the diffractive production of vector mesons and real photons still waiting for a better understanding .",
    "nevertheless , new analyses on hera data are still in rpogress . *",
    "we show that data on dvcs from hera can be fitted with a semi - hard pomeron , not being flat .",
    "* the pomeron trajectory could be a non - linear function ; it is nearly linear at small and moderate values of @xmath35 , leveling off at large @xmath35 .",
    "the same logarithmic trajectory could be used in hadronic reactions , for example in analyzing , with higher precision , the future diffractive exclusive data from lhc , where details , such as the two - pion threshold @xcite , neglected here , should be taken into account . * here we used a simple minimal  model , with a small number of the free parameters , which , in view of the limited number of data points , made possible the convergence of the minimization procedure .",
    "a more detailed analyses should include also the individual contributions from the longitudinal and transverse cross sections , though their ratio @xmath36 , spin effects , reaction ratios and comparison with possible qcd predictions , especially concerning the evolution in @xmath10 ( see next item and appendix ) . *",
    "a complete solution for the @xmath10 evolution in dvcs has not been yet found , although partial results are known from the literature . in a simplified , pragmatic approach the @xmath10 and @xmath28 dependence in a dvcs ( actually not factorizable ! ) , reduces the problem to the evolution of ordinary dis by the dglap procedure .",
    "these attempts are summarized in appendix . *",
    "the model and the fitting procedure presented in this paper can be extended to high - energy vector meson production .",
    "we intend to do so in a forthcoming publication .",
    "let us notice also that any consistent extension / interpolation of the regge approach to low energies ( resonance region ) should involve dual models , as it was shown  @xcite for the pomeron component in case of @xmath37 scattering .",
