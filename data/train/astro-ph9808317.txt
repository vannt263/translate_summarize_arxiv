    "the near - infrared camera and multiobject spectrometer ( nicmos ; thompson 1998 ) has taken multi - color images and grism spectra of random fields in the nicmos parallel program (  holfeltz 1998 ) . like the medium deep survey ( mds ; griffiths 1994 ) and the hubble deep field ( hdf ; williams 1996 ) , the nicmos parallel imaging provides high - resolution images of galaxies at the faintest magnitudes observed .",
    "our understanding of the evolution of galaxies has largely depended on our knowledge of their place in the hubble sequence .",
    "the mds provided the first measure of faint galaxy number - magnitude counts as a function of morphological type ( driver 1995 , glazebrook 1995 ) .",
    "it showed a population of rapidly evolving irregular / peculiar galaxies that appear to explain the faint blue galaxy excess . at large redshifts",
    ", it becomes problematic to deduce a galaxy s morphology from optical images , as the observation becomes increasingly dominated by blue and uv light from young stars , leading to a `` morphological k - correction '' ( oconnell 1997 ) . with nicmos deep imaging",
    ", it is now possible to sample the older stellar population and measure unbiased galaxy morphologies .",
    "nicmos parallel imaging also provides galaxy number counts , as deep or deeper than are possible from the ground .",
    "both optical and infrared number count surveys have detected excesses of faint galaxies over simple no - evolution model predictions ( tyson 1988 , gardner 1993 ; see ellis 1997 for a review ) .",
    "theoretical models can explain the continued rise of the k - band counts , seen in the recent surveys from the keck telescope , using either evolutionary effects or a dwarf - rich luminosity function  that is , one with a steep faint - end slope ( c.f .",
    "bershady et al .",
    "however , ground - based counts at the k=23 level are based on only @xmath6  total over 6 - 7 fields of view , so the critical last few magnitude bins may be affected by biased lines of sight .",
    "in this paper we present an analysis of  images obtained in the nicmos parallel program in 1997 . in section 2",
    "we describe the data and our reduction methods . in section 3",
    "we present the galaxy number counts ; in section 4 we discuss a quantitative morphological classification of the galaxies and compare the result to optical surveys .",
    "the parallel program consisted of `` jhk '' imaging using cameras 1 and 2 ( hereafter nic1 and nic2 ) at their best focus until november 1997 , and @xmath7  and  imaging in camera 3 ( nic3 ) , as well as some grism spectroscopy , thereafter .",
    "data were taken in individual exposures of 256s or 1024s for nic2 and 256 or 576 seconds for nic3 .",
    "we selected 160 nic2 pointings at galactic latitudes above 20  that are unaffected by foreground stars or the primary target and have no instrumental oddities or other impediments ( a total area of 15.2 square arcminutes ) .",
    "we also examined the first 30 nic3 fields ( 20.2 square arcminutes ) .",
    "an independent analysis of the nic3 data is presented by yan ( 1998 ) .",
    "nicmos parallel data are taken in `` multiaccum '' mode , in which the array is read out nondestructively many times during each exposure .",
    "the resulting data cube contains multiple measurements of the accumulated flux at increasing integration times .",
    "the count rate for each pixel can be determined from the slope of a line fit to these data ( after dark subtraction ) .",
    "this procedure allows cosmic ray rejection by identifying breaks in the slope .",
    "nic3 data were reduced using the calnica iraf routines ( bushouse , 1997 ) , using a model ( noiseless ) cube of multiaccum dark data constructed by stsci and a skyflat derived from the median of all nic3  observations available at the time .",
    "nic2 data were reduced independently of the calnic routines which were still under development at the time .",
    "the major difference between our routines and calnica is that we fit the slope of the multiaccum data before flatfielding .",
    "there was insufficient sky background in the nic2 data to construct a viable skyflat and the best inflight pointed flat was used instead .",
    "individual reduced frames were registered for each field . for nic3 data",
    ", we used the centroid of many objects to calculate the precise offsets between dithered frames .",
    "registration was performed with bilinear interpolation for fractional pixel shifts . during registration",
    ", a second cosmic ray rejection was performed using a sigma - clipping algorithm .",
    "many nic2 fields contained no bright objects for registration . in that case",
    ", we used the astrometry information from the telescope pointing to calculate fractional pixel shifts .",
    "objects were identified using the sextractor software ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , admitting no object with fewer than 6 pixels .",
    "identifications were carefully checked by eye to avoid false detections from cosmic rays or noise at the vignetted edges of nic3 frames .",
    "photometry was performed in elliptical apertures set at 2.5 times the kron `` first moment '' radius ( kron 1980 ) .",
    "we measured 1@xmath8  limiting magnitudes by taking the standard deviation of aperture photometry performed on several hundred randomly selected positions throughout the frame .",
    "in a typical photometric aperture ( 3.5 pixel radius ) we measured galaxies with h@xmath9=22.8 for nic2 ( and 22.9 for nic3 ) at the 3@xmath8  level in 1024 second exposures .",
    "limits are expressed in magnitudes on the vega system .",
    "the offset to the ab magnitude system ( oke 1974 ) is @xmath10 for the  filter .",
    "the deepest fields reach h@xmath11  in nic2 and 24.0 in nic3 . in the 160 nic2 fields ,",
    "142 extended objects were detected . in the 30 nic3 fields examined , more than 500 objects were detected .",
    "we examine the galaxy content of the central `` overlap '' regions of the registered images , that is the regions with full exposure time .",
    "we estimate completeness with simulations based on recovery of mock objects inserted into real coadded images .",
    "we find @xmath12% completeness at the 5@xmath8  level and 60% completeness at 3@xmath8 .",
    "we have included a small ( @xmath13 ) correction to our completeness estimate to account for reduced sensitivity to larger objects ( see bershady  1998 ) . for objects bright enough for a reliable estimate of the full - width half - maximum ( based on the sextractor algorithm ) , we separate unresolved stars from the galaxies . in a typical field ,",
    "this limit is h@xmath14 .",
    "we then assume that all fainter objects are galaxies , since there should be little contamination from faint stars in these fields .",
    "a similar assumption was made by djorgovski ( 1995 ) in making the deep k - band galaxy counts .",
    "figure 1 compares the @xmath1band counts to the deepest ground - based k - band counts , using a model prediction of their median color ( the _ ncmod _ program , gardner 1998 ) to translate the counts from the k - filter to the nicmos  filter .",
    "for example , _ ncmod _ predicts @xmath15 at = 23 . as has been seen in k - band data ( bershady et al .",
    "1998 , moustakas 1997 ) , the @xmath16  galaxy counts continue to rise at the faintest levels .",
    "we note that the nic3 counts appear less smooth than individual ground - based surveys or the nic2 counts .",
    "while this effect could be real , it may be the result of non - poissonian errors ( e.g. field to field variations , completeness , etc . )",
    "our future analysis of the entire nic3 sample will fully explore this question .",
    "our results show that nicmos has already reached h@xmath11 at the 5@xmath8  completeness limit , using the most conservative error estimates . in the longest future pointings",
    ", nicmos parallel data will go deeper than current ground - based ir number counts , and will accumulate more area .",
    "we take advantage of the high resolution of nicmos images to evaluate galaxy morphology using the classification algorithm of abraham et al .",
    "( 1996a ) .",
    "the procedure uses the central concentration ( @xmath17 ) and asymmetry ( @xmath18 ) , to separate e / s0 s , spirals , and irregulars .",
    "ellipticals have strong central concentration , and low asymmetry .",
    "spirals show a considerable range of asymmetry and lower central concentration .",
    "irregulars , peculiars and mergers lie in the `` exclusion zone '' of asymmetric and diffuse objects , where no ellipticals or spirals are expected to fall .",
    "the asymmetry is determined by rotating the galaxy image about its center , subtracting the original and measuring the ratio of flux in the absolute value of the difference to that in the original .",
    "the central concentration compares the flux in an aperture containing the inner third of the object as defined by the second order moments to the total flux ( abraham 1994 ) .",
    "both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are very sensitive to the size and center of the aperture containing the object .",
    "abraham defined the center of the object to be the brightest pixel in the object after convolution with a 1 pixel wide gaussian .",
    "they defined the object aperture to be an isophot enclosed by the pixels 1.5@xmath8  above the sky .",
    "we have used the same algorithm to determine @xmath17 and @xmath18 , but we use the object centroid as the center , and we use an elliptical aperture determined by sextractor , also based on 1.5@xmath8  sensitivity .    to calibrate our classification routines ,",
    "we have used a reference sample of 81 ground - based images of e through scd galaxies obtained by frei ( 1996 ) from lowell observatory .",
    "this is the same comparison set used by abraham et al . comparing the values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 we measure for this sample to the abraham values , we obtain similar results with a scatter roughly equal to the errors , @xmath19 .",
    "we also obtain consistent @xmath17 and @xmath18 values for artificially redshifted versions of the frei sample .",
    "abraham applied a complex artificial redshifting scheme , applying a k - correction pixel by pixel .",
    "we have instead concentrated on understanding the effects of the pixel scale .",
    "we find that , as expected , galaxies can appear more symmetric at lower resolution , while their central concentration is almost unchanged , thereby preventing a spurious increase in the number of irregular galaxies when classified at nic2 resolution . to confirm this expectation , we artificially redshifted the frei sample to z = 0.3 , 0.5 , and 0.7 with the nicmos plate scale .",
    "we continue to see a clean separation of morphological types agreeing with the unredshifted type . at higher z , some galaxies cross the elliptical / spiral boundary in about equal measure in each direction , but we see no suggestion that changing the sampling or signal - to - noise of galaxies moves them into the `` irregular / peculiar '' part of the plane",
    ".    we automatically classified all galaxies with @xmath2010@xmath8 , the cutoff at which our `` eyeball '' classifications could be trusted ( h@xmath21 in the deepest fields and 1 to 2 magnitudes brighter in the shallowest ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the morphological classification of all such objects in our nic2 number counts sample ( 106 galaxies total ) .",
    "we find that based on our visual identification , the spiral / elliptical difference could be identified mostly using central concentration , while spiral / irregular separation relies heavily on asymmetry .",
    "however , no fewer `` misidentifications '' would be achieved using a vertical cut in the c / a plane , so we retain the divisions of abraham et al .",
    ", as borne out in our simulations .",
    "we find few irregular galaxies ( 17% of the total sample and 23% of galaxies fainter than = 21 ) . by comparison ,",
    "the mds survey found that 21% of the galaxies at @xmath22  are irregular , while in the hdf the percentage rises to 3040% at 22@xmath23 ( abraham 1996b ) .",
    "our = 2023 limits correspond to @xmath24=22.124.5 for a mixture of elliptical and spiral galaxies , or @xmath24=21.324 for late type spirals and irregulars .",
    "this quantitative result is confirmed by visual inspection ; no `` train wrecks '' are seen ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "this fraction of faint , infrared - selected irregular galaxies appears small compared to the number found in the mds and hdf .",
    "there are two possible explanations for this effect : 1 ) we are seeing the same galaxies but they are more regular in the nir , or 2 ) we do not see all of the irregulars because they are too blue .",
    "put another way , are we seeing different stars or different galaxies ?    to distinguish between these cases ,",
    "we compare our results to a model translation of the @xmath24-band counts ( gardner 1998 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows number counts segregated by morphological type . for comparison , the number counts by type from abraham ( 1996b ) and glazebrook ( 1995 ) are shifted to the  filter and plotted .",
    "there is a clear difference in relative depth between the optical and ir data for different morphological types . for the redder ellipticals , the nic2 counts reach as deep as the @xmath24  data , but for the blue irregulars the  data reach only a magnitude shallower than the @xmath24  counts .",
    "we see good agreement between the  and @xmath24  number counts in each morphological bin . in particular ,",
    "though there are slightly fewer irregular galaxies at @xmath25  in the -band , they are in excellent agreement at fainter magnitudes ( the difference is likely due to the small numbers of galaxies being counted ) . clearly , if we were seeing a strong morphological k - correction , this difference would not be the case .",
    "such an effect would require that  observations find less irregulars at faint magnitudes than predicted based on @xmath24  observations .",
    "this result implies that the irregular galaxies observed in the mds are at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath26 ) . at that redshift ,",
    "the observed @xmath24-band is approximately the rest - frame v band , while the observed @xmath16-band is the restframe j - band .",
    "if the irregular galaxies were at high redshift ( @xmath27 ) , where optical observations sample the rest - frame ultraviolet , then there would be a large morphological difference in the observed near infrared .",
    "for example , many lyman break galaxies in the hdf are seen to have highly disturbed morphologies ( see lowenthal 1996 ) , which have been suggested by oconnell ( 1997 ) to be similar to the uv morphology of typical spirals .",
    "this is consistent with the results of glazebrook ( 1998 ) , who obtained spectra of 31 galaxies from the mds irregular galaxy sample and found them to be at typical redshifts of 0.5 , though they note that the irregulars are not necessarily a single uniform population .",
    "the relatively small number of irregulars in our sample is due to their blue color .",
    "glazebrook ( 1998 ) find irregular galaxies at @xmath22   have ( observed ) i - k colors of 23 , with some red outliers . since the bulk of the irregulars are at i@xmath28 , that would imply infrared magnitudes on the order of h@xmath2022 .",
    "this prediction is consistent with our data , since we see some irregulars ( possibly the red outliers ) but a lower percentage than was seen in the @xmath24-band data .",
    "could we see the high - redshift population in the nicmos data ?",
    "typical lyman break galaxies have ir magnitudes of k=2122 ( steidel 1996 ) , and may have @xmath29  and therefore be just at the edge of our ability to classify in the current data ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "future nicmos observations should be able to detect such galaxies , though much of that work will be done using nic3 with its coarser plate scale , making morphological classification more difficult .    in summary",
    ", we have examined nicmos parallel imaging data .",
    "we find good agreement between the  number counts and those in the deepest ground based surveys .",
    "we have morphologically classified the galaxies in the nic2 data following the quantitative classification scheme of abraham ( 1996a ) .",
    "we see evidence for the same population of faint blue irregular galaxies observed in the mds and hdf data .",
    "we argue that that the irregulars ( at @xmath3122 ) are at z@xmath32 .",

    "we thank jennifer sandoval for assisting with obtaining the data .",
    "we thank r. abraham and k. glazebrook for providing ascii tabulation of their morphologically segregated number counts .",
