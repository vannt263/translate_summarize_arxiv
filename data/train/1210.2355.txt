    "the gas surface density observed in an entire galaxy or a relatively large region is a global property that results from a very heterogeneous distribution of the volume density on small scales .",

    "we consider a region of surface @xmath1 and thickness @xmath2 , whose total mass @xmath3 is distributed according to a mass - weighted probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath4 .",

    "this gas becomes available again for sf after a time @xmath26 .",
    "no more than @xmath27 of the gas mass can be consumed for sf per timescale @xmath26 @xcite .",

    "for instance , this represents the interval between the compression by two spiral arms , or for giant clumps to collapse in high - redshift disks . in nuclear starbursts",
    "however , the dynamical timescale is much shorter ( @xmath30 ) but strong stellar feedback from ob - type stars takes over and also regulates sf , by limiting the conversion of gas into stars to @xmath31 @xcite over the duration of the starburst event , i.e. @xmath29 here again @xcite .      _ without feedback _ ( equation  [ eqn : sfr ] ) and for a log - normal pdf , we obtain ] @xmath32 as illustrated in fig .",

    "first , on top of self - gravity , the galactic environment of a cloud can modify its equilibrium , delaying or accelerating the onset of sf . the tidal field and",
    "the shear tend to stabilize clouds against collapse @xcite .",

    "although it depends on the galactocentric radius , this tidal density averaged over the galaxy is @xmath68 , with limited variations with galaxy type and redshift .",
    "second , support by magnetic fields might stabilize molecular clouds , leading to higher thresholds and shallower slopes in all regimes .    both these alternative interpretations would translate into mild variations of the density threshold with the galactic environment .",
    "however , if , as we have proposed here , the local density threshold corresponds to the onset of supersonic turbulence , highly turbulent media ( e.g. mergers and high redshift disks ) would have very low thresholds leading to breaks in the observed sf relation shifted to low surface brightness , close to the detection limits and thus difficult to detect .",

    "* ) started to probe this regime ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_obs ] ) : some regions are spiral - like ( as expected since not all mergers are starbursting ) but @xmath69 of them have significant @xmath34 for very low @xmath38 , well below the break of spirals .",
    "larger samples are needed to tell apart starbursting regions from spiral - like ones , and to confirme the trend suggested here .",
    "this could also be tested with resolved observations of @xmath70 disks , to further probe the physical origin of the local density threshold .",
    "in this letter , we present an analytical formalism aiming at describing the relation between the surface density of gas and the surface density of sfr observed in several types of galaxies . the only two ingredients of the model are the gas density pdf ( representing the turbulence - driven structure of the ism ) , and a local sf law , with a threshold due to the onset of supersonic turbulence , plus regulation by stellar feedback .",
    "our main findings are :    * when integrated over regions of galaxies or entire galaxies , the threshold in the local sf law translates into a break at low surface densities .",
    "* above this break , the local sf law directly imprints the global sfr surface density , leading to a @xmath33-index power - law , followed by a unity slope at high surface density , when feedback takes over turbulence as the main regulation agent . *",
    "the slow nature of star formation in nearby spirals with gyr - long gas depletion timescales is mostly explained by turbulent regulation ( i.e. divergent flows disrupting gas clouds , @xcite ) .",
    "feedback regulation becomes more prominent in denser and more turbulent systems ( e.g. high-@xmath64 galaxies or galactic molecular clouds ) and produces the observed shallower relation for the entire disk population ( average slope 1.1 - 1.3 ) .",
    "* the different properties of the smc can explain the onset of supersonic turbulence at higher surface densities than in spirals , and our model retrieves the observed longer depletion times without necessarily invoking molecule formation or shielding by dust .",
    "* in starbursting mergers , the strong interaction - induced turbulence results in high - efficiency sf , with a break shifted to low densities but tentatively observed in resolved galaxies .    by simply using the typical values of ism properties from the literature for several galactic environments , our model naturally explains the observations , without fitting them nor fine tuning the parameters .",
    "the temperature of the gas shielded from ultraviolet radiations and _ in thermal equilibrium _ would drop when the density reaches @xmath71 @xcite , allowing ism turbulence to become supersonic at these relatively low volume densities . in spiral galaxies",
    ", such low threshold would translate into an apparent break at @xmath72 .",
    "instead , according to models including not only ultraviolet radiative transfer but also turbulent compression , the gas slowly cools below @xmath20 and enters the supersonic regime at about @xmath63 @xcite , which naturally explains the observed break at @xmath73 .",
