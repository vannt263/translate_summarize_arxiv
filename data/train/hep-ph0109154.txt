    "our universe is composed of baryon , but not anti - baryon . accounting for this baryon asymmetry in the present universe",
    "is one of the most fundamental and challenging problems in particle physics as well as in cosmology .",
    "various mechanisms have been proposed so far to solve this problem . in particular , there has been a growing interest in leptogenesis  @xcite , since there are now strong evidences of neutrino oscillations , equivalently the existence of tiny but nonzero neutrino masses .",
    "it is , then , very natural to consider lepton - number violating interactions in nature , which is a crucial ingredient for leptogenesis to work .",
    "especially , once we accept the supersymmetry ( susy ) and the existence of tiny majorana neutrino masses , there automatically exist in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) most of the necessary ingredients for the susy leptogenesis via @xmath4 flat direction , which was originally suggested by murayama and one of the authors ( t.y . )",
    "@xcite based on the idea of the affleck - dine ( ad ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "recently , we performed a detailed analysis of this my leptogenesis via @xmath5 flat direction in the context of gravity - mediated susy breaking scenarios including all of the relevant thermal effects  @xcite .",
    "we found a very interesting aspect of this leptogenesis , that is , `` reheating - temperature independence of cosmological baryon asymmetry ''  @xcite .",
    "the resultant baryon asymmetry is almost determined by the mass of the lightest neutrino ( and the gravitino mass ) , and hence we can determine the lightest neutrino mass from the baryon asymmetry in the present universe , quite independently of the reheating temperature of inflation .",
    "this results in a crucial prediction on the rate of the neutrinoless double - beta @xmath6 decay  @xcite , which may be testable in future @xmath7 decay experiments such as genius  @xcite .",
    "in this article , we study the effects of gauging the @xmath1 symmetry on the leptogenesis via the @xmath0 flat direction .",
    "( @xmath8 and @xmath9 are baryon and lepton number , respectively . )",
    "as well known , the @xmath1 symmetry is the unique global symmetry which can be gauged consistently with the mssm .",
    "if we accept a gauged @xmath1 symmetry , the existence of three families of the right - handed neutrinos are automatically required from the anomaly cancellation conditions .",
    "furthermore , if we assume that this @xmath1 symmetry is spontaneously broken at high energy scale , these right - handed neutrinos acquire large majorana masses of the order of the @xmath10 breaking scale , which naturally explains the tiny neutrino masses suggested from the recent neutrino oscillation experiments via the so - called `` seesaw mechanism ''  @xcite .    below the @xmath10 breaking scale ,",
    "the scalar potential along the @xmath0 direction is almost the same as in the case without a gauged @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "however , above the @xmath10 breaking scale , the scalar potential is lifted by the effect of the @xmath1 d - term in a certain region of parameter space , which provides us a new mechanism  @xcite to stop the @xmath11 field .",
    "( @xmath11 is the superfield parameterizing the @xmath0 `` effectively flat '' direction . )",
    "we show that if the @xmath11 field is stopped by the d - term potential , the baryon asymmetry is _ enhanced _ compared with the `` global '' case without a gauged @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "this is because the available a - term , which provides a phase rotational motion of the @xmath11 field generating the lepton asymmetry , is much bigger than that in the global case . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath11 field is stopped by the f - term potential coming from the operator responsible for generating the small neutrino mass , the obtained baryon asymmetry becomes the same as that in the global case  @xcite .",
    "( in the following discussion , we will call the former case `` d - term stopping case '' , while the latter one `` f - term stopping case . '' ) surprisingly enough , as we will see in the following discussion , if the amplitude of the @xmath11 field is fixed by the d - term potential during inflation , the baryon asymmetry linearly depends on the reheating temperatures of inflation , but it is completely independent of the gravitino mass .",
    "this is totally an opposite situation to the global case , in which the final baryon asymmetry is almost independent of the reheating temperatures of inflation and linearly depends on the gravitino mass .",
    "we find in the d - term stopping case that if high reheating temperatures , @xmath12 , are available , the lightest neutrino of mass , @xmath13 , can account for the present baryon asymmetry .",
    "furthermore , the `` gravitino - mass independence of the cosmological baryon asymmetry '' provides us a great advantage in gauge - mediated susy breaking scenarios  @xcite .",
    "gauge - mediated susy breaking is widely considered as one of the most interesting mediation mechanisms of susy breaking , since it can naturally explain the suppression of the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) . however , in those scenarios , the reheating temperature of inflation is strongly restricted from above in order to avoid the overproduction of gravitinos  @xcite .",
    "this makes most of the baryo / leptogenesis scenarios impossible , especially when the gravitino is lighter than @xmath14 , since in this case the reheating temperature @xmath15 is restricted as @xmath16 .. ] it was considered that the ad baryogenesis  @xcite ( which is the baryogenesis based on the ad mechanism ) is the unique candidate to produce an enough baryon asymmetry in gauge - mediated susy breaking scenarios . however , from a recent detailed analysis , it becomes clear that the ad baryogenesis is not successful in gauge - mediated susy breaking scenarios because of a serious q - ball formation  @xcite . in the present work , we will show that the my leptogenesis can naturally explain , in the d - term stopping case , the present baryon asymmetry even in gauge - mediated susy breaking models with the gravitino mass smaller than @xmath17 , if the mass of the lightest neutrino is @xmath18 .",
    "we should stress that such a light gravitino may be directly detected in future collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "we claim that our scenario is the first minimal model which explains the present baryon asymmetry in the gauge mediation model with a small gravitino mass @xmath19 .",
    "first , let us discuss the potential for the relevant fields . to demonstrate our point , we use a simple superpotential as follows : @xmath20 here , @xmath21 are coupling constants and we assume @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are singlets under the mssm gauge group and @xmath26 carry @xmath27 of @xmath10 charges , respectively . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are a right - handed majorana neutrino , an @xmath30-doublet lepton and higgs fields which couple to up and down type quarks , respectively .",
    "@xmath31 is the breaking scale of the @xmath1 symmetry . ,",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath31 to be real .",
    "this can be done by field redefinitions in eq.([s1 - 1 ] ) . ] as we will see later , the `` effectively flat '' direction relevant for the present baryon asymmetry is the flattest flat direction , and hence we will consider only one family which corresponds to the lightest left - handed neutrino .",
    "we adopt the following linear combination of @xmath9 and @xmath35 as the flat direction field @xmath11  @xcite : @xmath36    the khler potential must have non - minimal couplings of the @xmath11 field to the inflaton , otherwise the @xmath11 field gets a large positive mass term of the order of the hubble parameter ( which we will call a hubble mass term ) and it is driven exponentially towards the origin during inflation , and hence the leptogenesis via @xmath0 flat direction can not take place  @xcite .",

    "fortunately , however , we only need to know the shape in the neighborhood of the bottom of this potential , if the curvature around this bottom is as large as the hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "this is because all the scalar fields , which have masses as large as the hubble parameter , settle down at the bottom of the potential during inflation and trace this potential minimum throughout the history of the universe .",
    "this allows us to eliminate many terms in the potential by using the field relations required for minimizing the potential .",

    "one may wonder why the `` flat '' direction field @xmath11 can develop a large expectation value in spite of the presence of the @xmath1 d - term .",

    "@xmath151 gauge symmetry remains unbroken , and hence , gluons and gluinos are massless .",
    "furthermore , the down type ( s)quarks also remain massless since they have no coupling to the @xmath11 field .",

    "is different from that in ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "finally , we here check the assumption that the production of the lepton asymmetry takes place during the inflaton - oscillation dominated era , _",
    "i.e. _ , before the reheating process of the inflation completes .",
    "then , we have the following constraint ; @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the decay rate of the inflaton @xmath40 and @xmath168 denotes the number of relativistic degrees of freedom , which is @xmath169 in the mssm for @xmath170 .",
    "as long as there exists a soft mass @xmath102 or the @xmath34-term at high energy scale , @xmath101 is at least larger than that .",
    "thus , the above constraint is indeed satisfied for @xmath171 .",
    "furthermore , the hubble parameter of the oscillation time @xmath101 becomes much larger for higher reheating temperatures , because of the thermal effects .",
    "for example , the @xmath101 always satisfies the following relation  @xcite ; @xmath172 thus , the constraint given in eq .",
    "( [ s3 - 27 ] ) is satisfied as long as @xmath173 which is the case in all the relevant parameter space in the present analysis .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig - early ] . )",
    "therefore , the assumption @xmath174 is justified .",
    "one of the physical reasons to make the leptogenesis via @xmath0 flat direction so special among other baryo / leptogenesis scenarios using the ad mechanism is that it is free from the q(l)-ball  @xcite problem .",
    "the coherent oscillation of the @xmath11 field is unstable with spatial perturbations if the potential of the @xmath11 field is flatter than the quadratic potential . to denote the field which parameterizes a general flat direction . ]",
    "if this is the case , the coherent oscillation of the @xmath11 field fragments into non - topological solitons , q - balls  @xcite . by the recent detailed analysis by lattice simulations , it becomes clear that almost all of the charges carried by the @xmath11 field are absorbed into these q - balls  @xcite , and the present baryon asymmetry must be provided by the decay of the q - balls , not by the direct decay of the @xmath11 field .",
    "the formation of q - balls is a generic feature of the ad baryo / leptogenesis regardless of the mediation mechanism of susy breaking .    in gravity - mediated susy breaking scenarios ,",
    "the potential of the @xmath11 field is slightly flatter than the quadratic potential due to the running of the soft mass of the @xmath11 field coming from gaugino loops  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the q - ball is generally unstable .",
    "a difficulty arises from its long life time .",
    "if the decay temperature of the q - balls is well below the freeze out temperature of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , the amount of the lsp cold dark matter can be written as @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the number of lsp s produced per baryon number , which is at least 3 , and @xmath177 is the fraction of baryon number stored in the form of q - balls , and @xmath178 and @xmath179 are the nucleon mass and the neutralino @xmath180 lsp mass , respectively .",
    "@xmath181 denotes the ratio of the energy density of @xmath23 to the critical density of the present universe . from this relation , it is clear that the late time q - ball decay leads to the over production of the lsp cold dark matter .",
    "in fact , this late time decay of q - balls invalidates most of the ad baryo / leptogenesis scenarios in gravity - mediated susy breaking models .",
    "symmetry , which is an almost unique solution to solve the q - ball problem in gravity - mediation models except the present leptogenesis via @xmath0 flat direction . ]    on the other hand , in gauge - mediated susy breaking scenarios , the soft susy breaking mass of the @xmath11 field vanishes above the messenger scale , and the @xmath11 field has only logarithmic potential .",
    "this fact leads to the formation of q - balls .",
    "the q - balls in gauge - mediated susy breaking scenarios have very different characters compared with those in gravity - mediated susy breaking models .",
    "the effective mass of the q - ball per baryon number is proportional to @xmath182  @xcite , where @xmath183 is the charge of the q - ball .",
    "therefore , if the charge of the produced q - ball is large , the q - balls become completely stable and they remain as a cold dark matter in the universe  @xcite .",
    "once we fix the flat direction for the ad baryo / leptogenesis , we can estimate the size of the produced q - ball and its number density by using the result of the recent numerical calculations in ref .",
    "we find that the produced q - balls overclose the universe in almost all of the regions of parameter space .",
    "though there remains some tiny regions in parameter space in which the produced q - balls do not overclose the universe , most part of such regions are already experimentally excluded  @xcite .",
    "if we use the leptonic flat directions , such as @xmath184 , the produced q(l)-balls can decay into neutrinos , and hence they do not overclose the universe .",
    "unfortunately , however , we can only use the leptonic charges which evaporates before the electroweak phase transition , because we must convert the lepton asymmetry to the baryon asymmetry by `` sphaleron effects ''  @xcite . as a result",
    ", we find that the present baryon asymmetry can be explained only in extremely small regions of the parameter space .    how about the @xmath0 flat direction ?",
    "the soft susy breaking mass of the @xmath11 field has no contribution from gluino loops , but , on the other hand , it has a big opposite contribution from large top yukawa coupling , which makes the potential for the @xmath11 field steeper than quadratic potential .",
    "therefore , the gravity - mediation type q - balls are not formed in the @xmath0 flat direction  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 flat direction is the unique flat direction available for the ad baryo / leptogenesis which has a susy mass term , @xmath34-term .",
    "thus , once we assume the existence of the @xmath34-term even in the high energy scale relevant for the my leptogenesis , there always exists the quadratic potential for the @xmath11 field and the formation of q - balls is avoided even in the gauge - mediated susy breaking scenarios .",
    "( this is possible if the @xmath34-term is generated by an expectation value of a nonrenormalizable operator . )    therefore , the my leptogenesis is free from the q - ball problem not only in gravity - mediated susy breaking scenarios but also in gauge - mediated susy breaking scenarios .",
    "field starts to oscillate around the origin due to the thermal - log term @xmath185 , gauge - mediation type q - balls are formed .",
    "fortunately , however , in such a case , the q - balls produced by the thermal - log term are small enough to evaporate well above the electroweak phase transition .",
    "therefore , the thermal - log term does not harm the leptogenesis via @xmath0 flat direction . ]",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the supersymmetric leptogenesis via @xmath0 flat direction originally suggested by murayama and yanagida ( my )  @xcite in the presence of a gauged @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "we have shown that if the flat direction field @xmath11 is stopped by the f - term potential , the situation is almost the same as that in the global case where the @xmath1 is not gauged  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , however , we have found that the resultant baryon asymmetry in the d - term stopping case is enhanced compared with the global case . in this case , the @xmath11 field is stopped at the @xmath10 breaking scale , where the curvature along the phase direction coming from the hubble - induced a - term is smaller than the hubble parameter .",
    "this allows us to use a much bigger torque to rotate the @xmath11 field , since the @xmath11 field is initially displaced from the bottom of the valley of the hubble a - term potential unless we tune the initial phase of the @xmath11 field .",
    "we have shown that the baryon asymmetry is proportional to the reheating temperature of the inflation , but it is completely independent of the size of the gravitino mass . as a result , if high reheating temperatures @xmath186 are available , the mass of the lightest neutrino , @xmath187 , is sufficiently small to explain the present baryon asymmetry .",
    "furthermore , the gravitino mass independence of the resultant baryon asymmetry gives us a great advantage in gauge - mediated susy breaking scenarios .",
    "if the mass of the lightest neutrino is as small as @xmath128 , we can explain the present baryon asymmetry even in the case where the gravitino mass is @xmath188 , which may be directly tested in future experiments  @xcite .",
    "we stress that our scenario is the first minimal framework which can explain the present baryon asymmetry in gauge - mediated susy breaking scenarios with such a small gravitino mass .",
    "in addition , the my leptogenesis via @xmath0 flat direction is very special in the sense that it is completely free from the q - ball problem . in gauge - mediation scenarios , this requires the existence of the @xmath34-term ( susy - invariant mass for higgs multiplets ) in the high energy scale relevant for the leptogenesis , which may imply the high energy origin of the @xmath34-term in gauge - mediated susy breaking scenarios .",
    "the generation of the correct size of the @xmath34-term has been one of the most difficult problems in gauge - mediated susy breaking models .",
    "the presence of the baryon asymmetry in our universe can be regarded as an interesting implication for the origin of the @xmath34-term .",
    "finally , we briefly comment on the prediction on the rate of the @xmath7 decay . as in the global case , the present scenario also requires a hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum to generate the present baryon asymmetry even in the d - term stopping case .",
    "this results in almost the same prediction on the rate of the @xmath7 decay as that in the global case  @xcite .",
    "this consistency check of the present leptogenesis scenario will be given in future @xmath7 decay experiments  @xcite .",
