    "in this paper , we consider the @xmath0c+@xmath0c reaction as a case study to point out the problems for the inelastic scattering states which have so far remained unsolved , and to address particularly the magnitude problem for the inelastic scattering data .",
    "theoretical calculations using the coupled - channels ( cc ) method fail to correctly predict the magnitude of the single-2@xmath1 and mutual-2@xmath1 states data together with the elastic scattering data . in order to get the magnitude right",
    ", many futile theoretical attempts have been made for these states .",
    "previous theoretical works show that the shapes of the central real potentials are actually correct , since they explain the elastic scattering data and predict the resonances at the correct energies with reasonable widths .",
    "it appears that the failure of the standard methods is mostly related to the inelastic scattering data : the magnitude of the theoretical cross - sections is much smaller than the measured experimental data . in this paper",
    ", we make further applications of a new coupling potential @xcite in describing the scattering observables of the @xmath0c+@xmath0c system .",
    "for the spherical nuclei , the nuclear shape and also the shape of the potential between projectile and target nuclei are characterized by a constant radius @xmath2 , which defines the distance of the center of the nucleus from the surface . however , for a deformed nucleus , the radius parameter is no longer constant but depends on the angular location of the point ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the nucleus @xmath0c we study in this paper is strongly deformed and its collective excitation is taken into account by using the standard deformation procedure based on the taylor expansion .",
    "if the interaction potential between two nuclei is taken to be @xmath4 , the taylor expansion about @xmath5 yields , @xmath6 here , the first term is the usual diagonal optical potential that describes only the elastic scattering and the second and third terms are used to describe the inelastic scattering and to obtain the coupling potentials for the single-2@xmath1 and mutual-2@xmath1 states .",
    "@xmath7 in equation [ pot ] is given as : @xmath8 with @xmath9 as the projectile @xmath10 or the target @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the deformation parameter and it is -0.6 for the @xmath0c nucleus .    in the phenomenological analysis",
    ", the real nuclear potential has the square of the woods - saxon shape , and the imaginary potential has the woods - saxon volume shape .",
    "the parameters of the real and imaginary parts are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the microscopic analysis ,",
    "the nucleon - nucleon double - folding potential @xcite is @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the nuclear matter distributions for projectile and target nuclei respectively , and they are given by @xmath16\\ ] ] where @xmath17=0.1644 @xmath18 , @xmath19=0.4988 @xmath20 and @xmath21=0.3741 @xmath20 for projectile and @xmath22=0.207 @xmath18 , c=2.1545 fm , and a=0.425 fm for target nuclei .",
    "the m3y nucleon - nucleon effective interaction is taken in the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the real and imaginary potentials are shown in figure [ comp ] and the parameters are given in table [ param ] labelled as df .    in the new coupled - channels model",
    ", we have replaced the usual first derivative coupling potential by a second - derivative coupling potential in woods - saxon form which is multiplied by the diffuseness parameter ( @xmath10 ) to normalize the units in the calculations .",
    "the parameters are given in table [ param ] .",
    "we have used both the phenomenological and microscopic potentials to analyze the experimental data of the @xmath0c+@xmath0c reaction at e@xmath25=74.2 mev , 93.8 mev and 126.7 mev .",
    "the experimental data is taken from ref .",
    "the results of our analyzes are displayed in figure [ ground ] for the ground , [ single ] for the single-2@xmath1 , and [ mutual ] for the mutual-2@xmath1 states in comparison with experimental data .",
    "both double - folding and phenomenological potentials provide excellent agreement with the experimental data for the ground state at all energies and a good fit to the single-2@xmath1 state data .",
    "however , the mutual-2@xmath1 state prediction is much smaller than the measured one : the standard cc model using double - folding or phenomenological potentials underestimates its magnitude by a factor of 3 to 10 as it has been previously observed  @xcite .",
    "varying the parameters and changing the shape of the real and imaginary potentials do not provide a complete solution to the problems of this reaction  @xcite . in order to solve this problem",
    "we have used a new coupling potential .",
    "this potential has a second - derivative of woods - saxon shape and it is compared in figure [ comp ] with the standard coupling potential .",
    "this new coupling potential has a repulsive part at short distances and an attractive part at large distances which is related to the orientation of two @xmath0c nuclei at short and large distances @xcite .",
    "we have been able to obtain excellent agreement with all the available experimental data for the ground , single-2@xmath1 and mutual-2@xmath1 states by using this new coupling potential .",
    "the parameters are shown in table  [ param ] .",
    "this new approach solves the magnitude problem of the mutual-2@xmath1 state data , which has been an outstanding problem with this reaction .",
    "the results for the ground , single-2@xmath1 and mutual-2@xmath1 states are compared with the standard ones in figures [ ground ] , [ single ] and [ mutual ] .",
    "in the present work , we have demonstrated that a consistent solution could be obtained for the problems of the @xmath0c+@xmath0c reaction over a wide energy range .",
    "however , we achieve this by using a coupling potential which has a non - standard form . within the standard formalism ,",
    "our findings using folding or phenomenological potentials are in agreement with the previous works @xcite .",
    "although , within standard approach , these potentials give excellent agreement with the experimental data for the ground state , they are unable to provide a consistent solution to the problems of the inelastic scattering data .",
    "this work therefore clearly shows that the standard deformation procedure based on taylor expansion is inadequate in describing such highly deformed nuclei .",
    "it is obvious that the standard formalism should be questioned further .",
