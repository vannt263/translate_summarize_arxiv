    "mixing of a passive scalar in a turbulent flow is an archetypical problem in the study of turbulence and intermittency .",
    "the mixing of cloudy and clear air adds additional complexity , not only because the scalar fields ( e.g. , droplet number density , water vapor concentration , and temperature ) are no longer ` passive ' because of latent heating effects , but also because the condensed and vapor phases are coupled through mass conservation , and because the condensed phase itself can respond through various pathways .",
    "for example , upon mixing of cloudy and clear air , droplets will evaporate until the mixture becomes saturated ( assuming the initial presence of sufficient condensed water ) , but this could occur by all droplets evaporating by the same amount , or by a subset of droplets evaporating completely , leaving the remaining droplets unchanged .",
    "the consequences for cloud properties are significant : droplet collision rates and cloud optical properties depend strongly on the shape of the droplet size distribution and the droplet number density .",
    "the entrainment of clear air and its mixing with cloudy air occurs during the entire life of a cloud .",
    "it introduces strong inhomogeneities at spatial scales ranging from 10@xmath0 m down to 1 mm and at time scales from hours to seconds @xcite . through dilution , evaporation , and perhaps enhanced collision",
    ", the entrainment and mixing process changes the water droplet size distribution , which is of direct consequence to rain formation and cloud radiative properties and will eventually determine the cloud lifetime itself  @xcite . at stratocumulus cloud top ,",
    "for example , entrainment and evaporation influence the entire cloud dynamics  @xcite . here , the presence of strong wind shear can additionally enhance the entrainment rate @xcite .",
    "the mixing of clear and cloudy air can be characterized by the damkhler number , the ratio of a fluid time scale to a characteristic thermodynamic time scale associated with the evaporation process ( phase relaxation time ) @xmath1 the two limits , @xmath2 and @xmath3 characterize the _ homogeneous _ and _ inhomogeneous _ mixing , respectively .",
    "this notion was inspired by early laboratory experiments and the analogy with reacting flows @xcite : homogeneous mixing occurs when the condensational growth or evaporation of cloud water droplets is slow compared to the mixing time , and therefore takes place in a well - mixed environment ; inhomogeneous mixing occurs when the evaporation proceeds much faster than the flow structures evolve .",
    "both processes can coexist in a turbulent cloud since a whole spectrum of fluid time scales is present @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to gain a deeper understanding of the initial evolution of the mixing processes in a small subvolume at the clear air - cloud interface and to characterize the multiple - scale mixing processes .",
    "specifically , we investigate how the droplet size distribution evolves as the mixing progresses .",
    "we conduct therefore a series of three - dimensional ( 3d ) direct numerical simulations ( dns ) which combine the eulerian description of continuum fields such as velocity and vapor content with the lagrangian evolution of an ensemble of cloud water droplets .",
    "in particular , we want to study the relaxation of the condensed phase during the entrainment process as a function of the initial droplet radius and the number density of the droplets .",
    "these two variables determine the phase relaxation time scale , and therefore influence the relative length and time scales at which homogeneous and inhomogeneous mixing predominate .",
    "furthermore , we study the impact of turbulence on the entrainment and mixing by conducting simulations at different reynolds number for the same initial vapor and droplet configuration .",
    "finally , the effect of droplet inertia and gravitational settling is investigated . in order to focus on the one - way response of the droplet field to the turbulent mixing",
    ", we study the mixing processes in a simplified setting of model equations : the temperature is held fixed at a reference value of @xmath4 in the simulation domain , thus leaving the saturation vapor mixing ratio constant . as a consequence",
    ", the turbulence is not driven by buoyancy effects as in similar studies @xcite , but by a volume forcing that mimics a cascade of kinetic energy from larger scales obeying realistic amplitudes of the turbulent fluctuations that match the field measurements with actos platform in @xcite .",
    "the reason for this choice is to disentangle the role of different processes on the cloud water droplet dynamics .",
    "the focus on lagrangian behavior extends the prior computational studies of cloud mixing @xcite , allowing questions of variability in droplet growth history and droplet inertia to be directly addressed .",
    "the lagrangian perspective has been taken in other cloud studies @xcite , primarily with an emphasis on the bulk dynamics in a turbulent cloud and the resulting supersaturation field and droplet response ( e.g. , advection - diffusion equation for the supersaturation field ) .",
    "this study is focused rather on the microphysical response to a transient mixing event .",
    "we continue in the following subsections by considering the time scales that are thought to govern the nature of that transient response .",

    "the smallest mean time scale is the kolmogorov time @xmath8 with the kinematic viscosity @xmath9 and the mean kinetic energy dissipation rate @xmath10 .",
    "for constant @xmath11 the spectrum of possible damkhler numbers thus spans a range @xmath12 the crossover from homogeneous to inhomogeneous mixing is expected to be present at @xmath13 and this can be associated with a length scale in the turbulent cloud @xcite .",
    "together with @xmath14 one gets @xmath15 in our simulations with constant @xmath10 it therefore follows that the phase relaxation determines the spatial transition from inhomogeneous mixing @xmath16 at large scales , to homogeneous mixing @xmath17 at small scales",
    ". looked at from a somewhat different perspective , we find that the transition scale @xmath18 relative to the kolmogorov length scale is simply related to a power of @xmath19 : @xmath20    [ [ phase - relaxation - time - scale ] ] phase relaxation time scale + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the phase relaxation time is the exponential time scale associated with the condensational growth or evaporation of a population of droplets @xcite . we provide a derivation here because it is not necessarily familiar within the turbulence community , yet it is of central importance in the cloud mixing problem .",
    "we have tried to simplify the derivation sufficiently that the key assumptions are explicitly stated , but are not obscured by unnecessary details ; in this regard the reader is also referred to kostinski s lucid treatment @xcite .",
    "we begin by considering a single cloud droplet , assumed to be in equilibrium with its surrounding vapor field , so a steady mass flux of vapor toward the droplet surface is accompanied by a steady flux of latent heat away from the droplet surface @xcite .",
    "both steady fluxes are given by fick s law @xmath21 with the vapor mass density @xmath22 , the mass diffusivity @xmath23 , the temperature @xmath24 , and the thermal conductivity @xmath25 .",

    "likewise , mean droplet properties were not significantly altered with modest increases in reynolds number .    in this work ,",
    "the whole study has been conducted in a small subvolume of clear air - cloud interface , specifically in a cubic box of dimensions up to @xmath149 . for such size",
    ", we expect the mixing to be dominantly homogeneous , with large - eddy damkoehler numbers up to @xmath150=2.7 .",
    "this is exacerbated by the finding that the relevant phase relaxation time depends on the diluted droplet number density , so that the largest @xmath150 only reach 1.1 . in the future",
    ", we intend to carry out a similar analysis in a larger box such that inhomogeneous mixing can take over at the larger scales of the flow .",
    "this will allow us also to make contact with recent large - eddy simulations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it can be expected that the inclusion of the active character of the temperature field will modify the droplet growth . in the present case",
    "the temperature was set constant thereby reducing to an advection - diffusion problem for the vapor field .",
    "full thermodynamic consistency will require advection of temperature in the same turbulence , full consideration of latent heating associated with phase changes , and determination of the saturation vapor mixing ratio ratio as a function of the varying temperature field .",
    "results of the present studies must therefore be interpreted in light of these simplifications , and considered to be a first step in building up to the full complexity of the cloud mixing problem .",

    "<S> turbulent mixing and entrainment at the boundary of a cloud is studied by means of direct numerical simulations that couple the eulerian description of the turbulent velocity and water vapor fields with a lagrangian ensemble of cloud water droplets that can grow and shrink by condensation and evaporation , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the focus is on detailed analysis of the relaxation process of the droplet ensemble during the entrainment of subsaturated air , in particular the dependence on turbulence time scales , droplet number density , initial droplet radius and particle inertia . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the droplet evolution during the entrainment process is captured best by a phase relaxation time that is based on the droplet number density with respect to the entire simulation domain and the initial droplet radius . even under conditions favoring homogeneous mixing , </S>",
    "<S> the probability density function of supersaturation at droplet locations exhibits initially strong negative skewness , consistent with droplets near the cloud boundary being suddenly mixed into clear air , but rapidly approaches a narrower , symmetric shape . </S>",
    "<S> the droplet size distribution , which is initialized as perfectly monodisperse , broadens and also becomes somewhat negatively skewed . </S>",
    "<S> particle inertia and gravitational settling lead to a more rapid initial evaporation , but ultimately only to slight depletion of both tails of the droplet size distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the reynolds number dependence of the mixing process remained weak over the parameter range studied , most probably due to the fact that the inhomogeneous mixing regime could not be fully accessed when phase relaxation times based on global number density are considered . </S>"
