    "the two - dimensional cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a complex - valued function , and @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are real constants .",
    "among many other situations , nls arises as an approximate model of the evolution of a nearly monochromatic wave of small amplitude in pulse propagation along optical fibers  @xcite where @xmath5 , in gravity waves on deep water  @xcite  @xcite where @xmath6 and in langmuir waves in a plasma  @xcite where @xmath5 . as a description of a superfluid  @xcite ,",
    "nls is known as the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite  @xcite with @xmath5 .",
    "sulem and sulem  @xcite examine nls in detail .",
    "nls admits a large class of one - dimensional traveling wave solutions of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a real - valued function , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are real parameters . by making use of the symmetries of nls  @xcite , all solutions of this form",
    "can be considered by studying the simplified form @xmath15 where @xmath8 is a real - valued function , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 and @xmath13 are real parameters .",
    "if @xmath18 , then nls admits the following two solutions of the form ( [ simpleform ] ) @xmath19 @xmath20 if @xmath21 , then nls admits the following solution @xmath22 here @xmath23 $ ] is a free parameter known as the elliptic modulus and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are jacobi elliptic functions . byrd and friedman  @xcite provide a complete review of elliptic functions .",
    "if @xmath27 , then each function @xmath28 is periodic . as @xmath29 , the period of each increases without bound , and @xmath28 limits to an appropriate hyperbolic function , which we call a `` solitary wave . ''",
    "these solutions , plus the `` stokes wave '' ( plane wave ) @xmath30 comprise the entire class of bounded traveling wave solutions of nls with trivial phase  @xcite .",

    "pelinovsky  @xcite reviews the stability of solitary wave solutions of nls with @xmath6 and @xmath18 , and presents an analytical expression for the growth rate of the instability near a cut - off .",
    "extensive reviews of the stability of solitary wave solutions are given in  @xcite .",
    "the periodic problem has not been studied in as much detail , though martin , yuen and saffman  @xcite examine numerically the stability of the solution given in ( [ dnnlsesolution ] ) for a range of parameters .",
    "we present four main results in this paper .",
    "first , every one - dimensional traveling wave with trivial phase is unstable with respect to some infinitesimal perturbation with two - dimensional structure . for _ all _ choices of the parameters ,",
    "there are unstable perturbations with long transverse wavelength .",
    "this generalizes the result of  @xcite .",
    "second , if @xmath5 , then the only unstable perturbations have transverse wavelength longer than a well - defined cut - off .",
    "third , if @xmath6 , then there is no such cut - off .",
    "there are unstable perturbations with arbitrarily short wavelengths in both transverse and longitudinal directions .",
    "these short wavelength instabilities seem to have been overlooked in previous analyses .",
    "fourth , for @xmath6 , the unstable perturbations with short wavelength have transverse wavenumbers that are confined to narrower and narrower intervals as the transverse wavenumber grows without bound . in these unstable intervals , as the transverse wavenumber grows without bound , the maximum growth rate approaches a well - defined limit .",
    "as @xmath29 , this limiting growth rate tends to zero if @xmath18 , and to a finite non - zero limit if @xmath21 .",
    "we consider perturbed solutions , @xmath33 , with the following structure @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are real - valued functions , @xmath37 is a small real parameter , @xmath16 , and @xmath38 is one of the solutions presented in the previous section .",
    "substituting ( [ pert ] ) into ( [ nlse ] ) , linearizing and separating into real and imaginary parts gives    @xmath39    @xmath40    [ evaluepde ]    without loss of generality , assume that @xmath35 and @xmath36 have the forms    @xmath41    @xmath42    [ uvtrivial ]    where @xmath43 is a real constant , @xmath44 is a complex constant , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are complex - valued functions and @xmath47 denotes complex conjugate .",
    "this leads to    @xmath48    @xmath49    [ evprob ]    these are the central equations in this paper .",
    "we assume that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are periodic with the same period as @xmath8 .",
    "more general boundary conditions are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "instability occurs if ( [ evprob ] ) admits a periodic solution with @xmath50 . without loss of generality , for the remainder of this paper",
    "we assume @xmath51 by redefining @xmath13 .    in sections [ smallrhosection ] and [ largerhosection ] , we examine ( [ evprob ] ) using small-@xmath43 and large-@xmath43 asymptotic analyses respectively . in section [ monodromysection ] , we present results from a numerical study in which ( [ evprob ] ) was solved for a wide range of @xmath43 values .",
    "generalizing the work in  @xcite , we assume that for fixed @xmath52 and for fixed small @xmath43 , ( [ evprob ] ) admits solutions of the form    @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55    where the @xmath56 are complex constants and the @xmath57 and @xmath58 are complex - valued periodic functions with the same period as @xmath8 .",
    "this assumption leads to the `` neck '' mode    @xmath59    @xmath60    @xmath61    and the `` snake '' mode    @xmath62    @xmath63    @xmath64    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are functions of the elliptic modulus of the unperturbed solution .",

    "these plots establish that @xmath67 for ( [ cnnlsesolution ] ) and ( [ dnnlsesolution ] ) and @xmath68 for ( [ snnlsesolution ] ) . therefore",
    ", if @xmath5 , ( [ cnnlsesolution ] ) and ( [ dnnlsesolution ] ) are unstable with respect to long - wave transverse perturbations corresponding to the neck mode and ( [ snnlsesolution ] ) is unstable with respect to long - wave transverse perturbations corresponding to the the snake mode .",

    ", if @xmath6 , ( [ cnnlsesolution ] ) and ( [ dnnlsesolution ] ) are unstable with respect to the snake mode and ( [ snnlsesolution ] ) is unstable with respect to the neck mode .",
