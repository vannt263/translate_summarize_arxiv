    "with the successful start of collisions at 7 tev a few months ago , the large hadron collider has put another milestone towards a thorough exploration of the terascale . the large energy available",
    "will open many multi - particle channels that have being widely investigated  @xcite . in view of a correct interpretation of the signals of new physics which might be extracted from data , it is of considerable interest to reduce our theoretical uncertainty for the physical processes under study , especially when large qcd backgrounds are involved . in this respect",
    ", the need of next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections for the lhc is unquestionable .",
    "many efforts have been made in the last few years in developing efficient techniques for one - loop calculations , using both highly - refined traditional methods and the new approaches of opp and generalized unitarity .",
    "a significant achievement of this work has been the calculation of complete nlo predictions for several interesting @xmath1 processes at lhc  @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we describe the main features of the ` helac - nlo ` approach to nlo calculations .",
    "we provide an overview of the computational framework and briefly summarize some physics results obtained with this system .",
    "the calculation of the virtual corrections is organized in the framework of the opp method .",
    "any one - loop amplitude is characterized by a set of denominators given as products of loop propagators , @xmath2 , and a polynomial  in the loop momentum  function called numerator , @xmath3 , such that it can be represented in the form @xmath4 where both the loop momentum @xmath5 and the numerator function are considered to be evaluated in @xmath6 dimensions . on the other hand , it is well known that any one - loop amplitude admits a decomposition in terms of a basis of @xmath6-dimensional scalar integrals . in the limit @xmath7",
    ", this decomposition can be cast into the form @xmath8 where box , triangle , bubble and tadpole denote the known scalar loop functions and @xmath9 is a rational function in the invariants also known as rational term .    the basic idea of opp is to decompose the numerator of the integrand function , @xmath10 , into a basis of monomials of the propagators appearing in the denominator : the coefficients of the expansion are the @xmath11 appearing in eq.[opp ] plus additional , @xmath12-dependent , coefficients also known as spurious terms , whose analytical dependence on the loop momentum is known .",
    "it is therefore possible to evaluate the coefficients of the expansion by computing @xmath10 a sufficient number of times ( equal the number of coefficients to be determined ) , by appropriate choices of @xmath12 .",
    "one possibility is to select those values of the loop momentum that nullify certain sets of propagators  the so - called unitarity cuts  and solve the resulting linear system of equations in terms of the expansion coefficients .",
    "if the numerator @xmath10 is considered in @xmath13 dimensions , it is necessary to decompose the rational terms , @xmath14 : we call @xmath15 the part of the rational terms that is derived through the reduction starting with a @xmath13 numerator function .",
    "@xmath16 is the part of the rational terms that originates from the explicit @xmath17 dependence of the numerator function evaluated in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "as has been proven in @xcite @xmath16 can be fully determined by including new interaction - vertices with up to four legs , in full similarity with the usual uv counter - terms .",
    "on the one hand the method can be fully implemented numerically , resulting to a very fast reduction of arbitrary multi - leg amplitudes . on the other hand , being inherently algebraic , provides exact results ( with arbitrary precision ) for the coefficients multiplying the one - loop scalar functions as well as for the rational terms .",
    "the opp method thus provides a systematic framework to evaluate the cut - constructible part of the amplitude as well as the @xmath15 term , given a numerator function as input ( see @xcite for details ) .    in the approach we follow ` helac-1loop `  @xcite , based on ` helac - phegas `  @xcite , automatically generates all the input numerators for the opp reduction as well as all tree - order - like contributions including the new vertices needed for the full determination of the rational part ( @xmath16 )  @xcite , as well as uv - renormalization counter - terms . for a detailed description of the algorithm",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "to summarize , our approach for the evaluation of one - loop amplitudes relies upon three basic elements : 1 ) an implementation of the opp reduction ; 2 ) a library of scalar loop integrals ; 3 ) an algorithm to automatically evaluate numerator functions and @xmath16 terms .",
    "these tasks are solved respectively by the codes ` cuttools ` , ` oneloop ` and ` helac-1loop `  @xcite .",
    "we organize the calculation of virtual corrections using a re - weighting technique and adopt helicity and colour sampling methods in order to optimize the performance of our system  @xcite .",
    "the treatment of the qcd colour is based on the colour connection representation .",
    "given a generic qcd amplitude , @xmath18 , composed by @xmath19 gluons and @xmath20 quarks ( antiquarks ) with colour indices @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) respectively , it is possible to get a uniform representation for quarks and gluons by contracting each gluon index @xmath21 with a corresponding @xmath24 : @xmath25 the resulting amplitude can be now decomposed in terms of colour - stripped partial amplitudes @xmath26 : @xmath27 with @xmath28 , and @xmath29 denoting a permutation of the set @xmath30 .",
    "each @xmath26 is interpreted as the contribution to the amplitude associated to one possible way of connecting the external particles through colour flow , the connection being established by the indices of the @xmath31 s .",
    "the feynman rules that allow the calculation of all @xmath26 s have been described in refs .",
    "@xcite .    at the level of squared matrix element ,",
    "the following equivalence holds : @xmath32 where the colour matrix , @xmath33 , can be evaluated automatically by counting the number of cycles that are obtained by closing the colour flows of @xmath34 .",
    "full colour summation is performed using the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ fullcolorsum ] .",
    "while appealing , the colour - connection representation has a drawback in that the computation becomes less efficient for processes with high parton multiplicities .",
    "indeed , the number of partial amplitudes that have to be evaluated for a given phase - space point increases factorially with the number of the external coloured particles . a possible way out",
    "is given by the colour sampling approach where , following the left hand side of eq .",
    "[ fullcolorsum ] , one generates for each phase - space point a random colour assignment and computes the matrix element @xmath35 accordingly : due to eq.[colordec ] , only the subset of the @xmath26 s which have a colour flow compatible with the given assignment contribute .",
    "in fact , as shown in table [ table:1 ] , the number of subamplitudes that have to be computed in this way is sensibly reduced , on the average , for increasing complexity of the colour structure .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +     at the lhc with @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",

    "it is amazing how much progress has been realized over the last few years in the field of multi - leg nlo calculations . `",
    "helac - nlo ` is a complete framework for nlo calculations , including virtual and real corrections . in its present form can be used for nlo qcd calculations for arbitrary processes including up to one - particle - irreducible 8-point one - loop functions .",
    "it has been successfully used for a number of processes of current interest , such as @xmath38 including the higgs signal contributions and @xmath39 jets . in the immediate future",
    ", we plan a complete analysis of @xmath40jets production including the full description of top decays and non - resonant contributions , i.e. @xmath41 . plans of further development include also the incorporation of all @xmath16 and uv counter - terms for full electroweak corrections .",
