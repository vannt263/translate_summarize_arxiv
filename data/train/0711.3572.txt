    "a _ legendrian knot _ in @xmath1 is a smooth embedding of @xmath2 that is always tangent to the @xmath0planes of the so - called _ standard contact structure _ @xmath3 , and a _ link _ is a finite disjoint union of knots .",
    "we consider legendrian knots up to _ legendrian isotopy _ , that is homotopy through legendrian knots .",
    "the most basic , `` classical '' invariants of legendrian isotopy are the thurston  bennequin number @xmath4 , rotation number @xmath5 , and smooth type .",
    "( of course , any invariant of smooth isotopy is also an invariant of legendrian isotopy . ) in this paper , we will study the so - called ruling invariants , introduced by chekanov and pushkar @xcite and independently fuchs @xcite .",
    "the beginning of legendrian knot theory dates back to 1984 when bennequin @xcite proved the famous inequality @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an arbitrary legendrian knot and @xmath8 is its ( smooth ) seifert genus .",
    "our goal is to strengthen the relationship between the genus and legendrian invariants by proving the following :    [ thm : canon ] the genus of any @xmath0graded ruling of the legendrian knot @xmath7 is less than or equal to the canonical genus of @xmath7 .",
    "rulings and the idea that a genus may be associated to them are central to this paper .",
    "however the discussion of these notions is deferred to section [ sec : rul ] .",
    "recall that the _ canonical genus _",
    "@xmath9 is the minimum of the genera of spanning surfaces obtained using seifert s algorithm on diagrams of the given knot .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : canon ] , given toward the end of section [ sec : dan ] , is a trivial application of a result of rutherford @xcite and morton s inequality @xcite that the @xmath10degree of the homfly polynomial bounds the canonical genus from below .    because for homogeneous knots ( a class of knots that includes all alternating and positive knots ) the canonical genus agrees with the genus @xcite , the following is immediate .",
    "[ kov ] the genus of any @xmath0graded ruling of the homogeneous legendrian knot @xmath7 is less than or equal to the genus of @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to homogeneous knots , the statement of the corollary holds for all prime knots up to @xmath11 crossings ; see section [ sec : jim ] .",
    "it also holds for connected sums of the aforementioned by the additivity of genus and proposition [ pro : connsum ] .",
    "it does not , however , hold in general .",
    "[ ellenpelda ] there exist ( prime ) knots whose genus is less than the maximum of the genera of their @xmath0graded rulings .",
    "two examples are shown in figure [ fig:14n22180 ] .",
    "one of these ( @xmath12 in the hoste  thistlethwaite table ) is a whitehead double of the trefoil , but the other ( @xmath13 ) is not a satellite knot ( thus it is hyperbolic ) .",
    "both are of genus @xmath14 and both possess rulings with genera up to @xmath0 .",
    "the genus @xmath0 ruling is unique and @xmath15graded for both .",
    "this shows that corollary [ kov ] fails in general for non - homogeneous knots even if we restrict the statement to @xmath15graded rulings .",
    "a strengthening of our statements to the @xmath16ball genus is not conceivable either .",
    "there exist slice knots , for example the alternating knot @xmath17 in rolfsen s table , with positive genus @xmath0graded rulings",
    ".    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : rul ] , we review rulings , their gradedness and genera , and establish some relations of these to the topology of the ruling . in section [ sec : dan ] , we review rutherford s work and prove theorem [ thm : canon ] .",
    "section [ sec : jim ] details how the two knots of example [ ellenpelda ] were found .",
    "acknowledgements : the phenomena described in this paper are related to lagrangian surfaces in @xmath18 that a legendrian in @xmath19 bounds . thus this paper can be thought of as a prelude of forthcoming joint work @xcite with tobias ekholm and ko honda .",
    "i had many inspiring discussions with them .",
    "i also thank jim hoste for the tremendous insight gained from the computer searches of knot tables that he conducted for me .",
    "my conversations with francis bonahon and dan rutherford were very useful , too .",
    "the _ front diagram _ of a legendrian link @xmath20 is its projection onto the @xmath21plane . for generic @xmath7",
    ", it has an equal number of so - called _ left and right cusps _ ( with respect to the @xmath22direction ) , and the rest of the diagram consists of strands that connect a left cusp to a right cusp .",
    "maslov potential _",
    "@xcite is a locally constant @xmath23valued , up to sign , of a legendrian link is defined as the greatest common divisor of the rotations of its constituent components . ]",
    "function that is defined along these strands with the following property : at each cusp , out of the two strands that join there , the one that is ( locally ) upper has potential that is @xmath14 higher than that of the other strand .    recall that the _ index _ of a crossing in a front diagram is the difference ( in @xmath23 ) of the maslov potentials of the two intersecting strands .",
    "( the potential of the lower strand is to be subtracted from that of the upper one . )",
    "we adopt the convention that when a front diagram is oriented , strands traveling to the right ( increasing @xmath22 ) have even maslov potential .",
    "this implies that even for multi - component links , a crossing has even index if and only if it is positive . for the following definition @xcite",
    ", we assume that the front diagram of the legendrian is generic in that no pair of crossings share the same @xmath22coordinate .",
    "[ def : rul ] a _ ruling _ is a partial smoothing of a front diagram @xmath24 where certain crossings , called _ switches _ , are replaced by a pair of arcs as in figure [ fig : switch ] so that the diagram becomes a union of standard unknot diagrams , called _",
    "eyes_. ( an eye is a pair of arcs connecting the same pair of left and right cusps that contain no other cusps and that otherwise do not meet , not even at switches . ) we assume the so - called _ normality condition _ : in the vertical ( @xmath25 ) slice of the diagram through each switch , the two eyes that meet at the switch fit one of the three configurations in the middle of figure [ fig : switch ] .    the notion above is also known as an _",
    "ungraded ruling_. if we assume that all switches are of even index , we get _",
    "@xmath0graded rulings_. the set of these objects will be denoted by @xmath26 . finally , _",
    "@xmath15graded rulings _ are those in which each switch has index @xmath27 .        the eyes bound disks and with the addition of twisted bands at the switches , we may consider the ruling as a surface . of @xcite . ] this may be referred to as the _ surface associated to the ruling _ , but usually we will simply identify the ruling and the surface .",
    "the _ genus _ of a ruling is the genus of its associated surface .",
    "this surface does not come with an embedding into @xmath28 though .",
    "( in @xcite , we will associate to it an immersed exact lagrangian in @xmath18 . ) in fact it follows from the results of this paper that such an embedding often does not exist . but",
    "first , let us make several simple observations .",
    "[ iranyit ] the surface associated to a @xmath0graded ruling is orientable .",
    "if an ungraded ruling of a legendrian link is topologically an orientable surface , then the link has an orientation so that the ruling is @xmath0graded .",
    "consider the maslov potential on the front diagram .",
    "the entire top arc of each eye in a @xmath0graded ruling is either on odd or on even potential and the entire bottom arc has the opposite parity .",
    "switches connect odd arcs to odd arcs and even arcs to even arcs .",
    "hence if we give ` odd top ' eyes one orientation of the projection plane and to ` even top ' eyes the opposite orientation , then ( by an examination of figure [ fig : switch ] ) this will extend continuously over the bands .    for the other claim , simply induce an orientation of the legendrian from that of its ruling . doing so , all switches will be positive crossings .",
    "now the following is obvious :    for front diagrams of ( single - component ) knots , a ruling is @xmath0graded if and only if its associated surface is orientable .",
    "ungraded , that is not - necessarily - orientable versions of theorem [ thm : canon ] and corollary [ kov ] fail even for alternating knots .",
    "the knot @xmath29 ( the positive @xmath30 torus knot ) bounds an embedded mbius band , thus has unorientable genus @xmath14 , and it also has a ruling of oriented genus @xmath0 ( i.e. , unoriented genus @xmath16 ) .",
    "if a ruling is topologically a disk , then it is @xmath15graded . in particular",
    "its boundary legendrian has @xmath31 .",
    "the eyes of such a ruling are connected by the switches in a tree - like fashion .",
    "consider a leaf of this tree and notice that because of the way the maslov potential is defined , its single switch must be of index @xmath27 .",
    "then remove this eye from the diagram and induct on the number of eyes .",
    "in fact , from the existence of a @xmath0graded ruling it already follows that @xmath31 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there exist legendrians with @xmath31 and ungraded rulings , hence with maximal @xmath4 in their smooth type @xcite , yet without a single @xmath0graded ruling .",
    "one such example is the untwisted double of the negative trefoil shown in figure [ untwdblnegtref ] , produced using the method of @xcite on a @xmath32adequate diagram of the knot . from rutherford s results , to be reviewed in the next section",
    ", it follows that no legendrian representative of this knot can have a @xmath0graded ruling .",
    "we may classify rulings according to their genera .",
    "in fact the quantity @xmath33 introduced in @xcite , is just the euler characteristic of the surface associated to the ruling @xmath34 .",
    "the counts of ungraded , @xmath0graded , and @xmath15graded rulings with a given genus ( or euler characteristic ) are legendrian isotopy invariants @xcite .",
    "the sequence of these counts for all genera is called the _ complete ruling invariant_. in the @xmath15graded case , the complete ruling invariant is very effective in distinguishing legendrian knots with the same classical invariants .",
    "by contrast , the ungraded and @xmath0graded complete ruling invariants are determined by the smooth type and the thurston ",
    "bennequin number .",
    "this is true by the two main theorems of @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the @xmath0graded case rutherford proves the following .",
    "[ thm : dan ] let @xmath35 denote the homfly polynomial of the legendrian knot @xmath7 , and let @xmath36 be the coefficient of @xmath37 in @xmath35 . then @xmath38    [ max ] on the other hand , the smallest @xmath39degree in the homfly polynomial , which we will denote by @xmath40 , is a well - known strict upper bound on @xmath4 @xcite . by the above",
    ", the existence of a @xmath0graded ruling implies that this bound is sharp ( that is , @xmath41 ) , i.e.  that the legendrian in question has maximal thurston ",
    "bennequin number within its smooth isotopy class .",
    "conversely , @xmath41 implies that our legendrian does have @xmath0graded rulings .",
    "in theorem [ thm : dan ] , our replacement of rutherford s @xmath42 with @xmath43 is valid by proposition [ iranyit ] .",
    "note that we also replaced the variable @xmath44 in his formulation of the homfly polynomial by @xmath45 .    for a knot type @xmath46",
    ", we define the _ ruling genus of @xmath46 _ , denoted by @xmath47 , to be the supremum of the genera of all @xmath0graded rulings of all legendrian representatives of @xmath46 .",
    "this is either a finite value ( and in that case a maximum ) or @xmath48 .",
    "note that by theorem [ thm : dan ] and remark [ max ] , any front diagram with smooth type @xmath46 and maximal thurston ",
    "bennequin number may be used to determine @xmath47 . in particular , if we know that @xmath49 , then we may directly read @xmath50 off of the homfly polynomial . on the other hand , deciding whether @xmath51 is essentially equivalent to knowing the maximum thurston  bennequin number of @xmath46 . at the time of this writing , that is still a hard problem in general",
    ".    with this new terminology , corollary [ kov ] simply asserts that @xmath52 whereas by theorem [ thm : canon ] , @xmath53    from rutherford s theorem above , it is obvious that the ruling genus @xmath50 is at most half of the @xmath10degree of the homfly polynomial , which in turn is a well known lower bound ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2 ) for the canonical genus of the knot .",
    "we close this section with one last simple observation , which essentially follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 11.2 ) .",
    "[ pro : connsum ] the ruling genus is additive for connected sums : @xmath54        choose front diagrams for @xmath55 and @xmath56 with maximal thurston ",
    "bennequin number .",
    "one may form their connected sum as in figure [ fig : connsum ] .",
    "assume without loss of generality that the maslov potentials near the two merging cusps match .",
    "then it is plain to see that with any of the three notions of definition [ def : rul ] , the set of rulings for the new diagram is the cartesian product of the two old sets .",
    "the claim follows at once .",
    "one finds several sufficient conditions for @xmath57 in terms of polynomial knot invariants . for all knots .",
    "whitehead doubles , having genus @xmath14 , are natural candidates for a counterexample ; see example [ ellenpelda ] .",
    "however i initially dismissed them , having misunderstood a claim in @xcite . ] these are listed in the two propositions below . as before , let @xmath40 denote the minimum @xmath39degree of the homfly polynomial @xmath58 of @xmath46 .",
    "versions of and on the following list were also published in @xcite .",
    "a.   [ lenny ] `` khovanov beats homfly '' : @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the khovanov homology group of @xmath46 in bigrading @xmath61 .",
    "b.   [ kauff ] `` kauffman beats homfly '' : the minimum @xmath39degree of the kauffman polynomial of @xmath46 is less than @xmath40 . c.   [ negative ] `` negative counts '' :",
    "there is an integer @xmath62 so that the coefficient @xmath63 of @xmath64 in the homfly polynomial is negative .",
    "d.   [ subset ] `` subset failure '' : the minimum @xmath39-degree in the kauffman polynomial is @xmath40 or more , but there is an integer @xmath62 so that if @xmath65 is the coefficient of @xmath66 in the dubrovnik version of the kauffman polynomial , then @xmath67 fails to hold .      in the first two cases , we separate @xmath68 and @xmath40 by inequalities .",
    "claim is a direct consequence of the so - called khovanov bound of the thurston ",
    "bennequin number @xcite .",
    "claim follows in the same straightforward way from the so - called kauffman bound @xcite .    in the other two cases , we assume @xmath41 and find a contradiction with rutherford s results .",
    "claim is obvious from theorem [ thm : dan ] . to prove the last statement",
    ", one needs to compare theorem [ thm : dan ] with rutherford s other main theorem in @xcite , which says that the coefficients @xmath69 count ungraded rulings of some given ( @xmath70 , to be exact ) euler characteristic .",
    "now the contradiction is obvious from the fact that @xmath0graded rulings are also ungraded .",
    "let @xmath71 denote the maximum @xmath10degree that appears in the homfly polynomial of @xmath46 in a monomial that also contains @xmath72 . with this , either @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",
    "( it is difficult to tell which one is true in the case of an arbitrary knot , even if none of the conditions listed in proposition [ pro : noruling ] holds . at present ,",

    "if such a front is found , then we know that @xmath73 . )        there is nothing to prove if @xmath74 , so we will assume that @xmath73 .",
    "that implies @xmath41 for those legendrian representatives that have @xmath0graded rulings .",
    "now , the bennequin test is so called because it is obvious from : @xmath78      using the conditions listed above , jim hoste kindly conducted a computer search of the table of knots for potential examples with @xmath80 .",
    "knots with @xmath81 ( i.e. , @xmath82 or @xmath48 ) were also ruled out . among prime knots up to @xmath11 crossings ,",
