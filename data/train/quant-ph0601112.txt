    "this paper will deal with two aspects of quantum fluctuations .",
    "one will be the frequency spectrum which is associated with casimir energy , that is , with the expectation value of the stress tensor operator or other quadratic operators .",
    "some earlier work will be reviewed , in which it was shown that the frequency spectra are wildly oscillating functions , which nonetheless have finite integrals .",
    "the finite casimir energy always corresponds to a very small fraction of the area under one oscillation peak .",
    "the possibility of altering this remarkable cancellation will be discussed .",
    "the second aspect of quantum fluctuations to be considered is the probability distribution associated with the fluctuations of smeared operators .",
    "the well - known result of a gaussian distribution for linear operators will be rederived .",
    "it will then be shown by way of a simple example that the fluctuations of quadratic operators can be described by a skewed , and hence non - gaussian , distribution .",
    "some further comments and speculations on the generic form of the probability distribution for stress tensor fluctuations will be offered .",
    "it is well - known that the formal frequency spectrum of quantum fluctuations is flat ; all modes appear on an equal basis in the expansion of a quantum field operator .",
    "this leads to the formally divergent zero point energy @xmath0 however , this `` unprocessed '' spectrum is unobservable .",
    "the only quantities which can be observed arise from `` processed '' spectra , which have been modified by a physical process .",
    "the formation of a black hole , for example , processes the flat spectrum of incoming vacuum fluctuations and converts it into a planck spectrum of outgoing particles , the hawking radiation .",
    "the finite effects of one loop quantum processes may also be associated with a nontrivial frequency spectrum .",
    "consider the casimir effect as an example .",
    "the presence of boundaries modifies the divergent vacuum energy , eq .",
    "( [ eq : zero_point ] ) , by a finite amount , the casimir energy . for a scalar field which satisfies periodic boundary conditions in one of three spatial dimensions ,",
    "this energy is ( units in which @xmath1 will be used in the remainder of this paper . ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the periodicity length and @xmath4 is the transverse area .",
    "it is of interest to ask whether one can assign a finite frequency spectrum to the casimir energy , that is , find a function @xmath5 such that @xmath6 this was done in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that one can obtain @xmath5 as a fourier transform of the renormalized energy density operator at time - separated points .",
    "a more recent discussion is given in ref .",
    "let @xmath7 be the renormalized stress tensor operator evaluated at two points separated in time by @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath9 , the operator evaluated at coincident points , is the observable stress - energy associated with the casimir effect . in particular , @xmath10 we can write @xmath11 this function was evaluated explicitly for the electromagnetic case in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for the case of a scalar field in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the result is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a discontinuous , periodic function given by @xmath14 and @xmath15    at first sight , the integral of @xmath5 over all frequencies is poorly defined .",
    "however , it can be defined with a suitable convergence factor , such as an exponential function .",
    "one finds that the casimir energy arises in the limit in which the convergence factor is removed .",
    "for example , @xmath16 the result is that the contributions of different frequency intervals almost exactly cancel one another , leaving a finite result which is small compared to the area of each of the peaks in fig .  [ fig : casimir ] .",
    "a similar spectrum can be associated with the asymptotic casimir - polder potential between a polarizable particle , such as an atom in its ground state , and a perfectly reflecting wall . in the limit",
    "that the atom is far from the plate , compared to the wavelength associated with the transition between the ground state and first excited state , casimir and polder  @xcite showed that the interaction energy is , in gaussian units , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the distance to the wall , and @xmath19 is the static polarizability of the atom .",
    "it may be expressed as @xmath20 where , in this case , @xmath21 \\,.\\ ] ] as before , the integral on @xmath22 may be defined using a convergence factor . the frequency spectrum in this case",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] .",
    "as we have seen , the frequency spectra associated with casimir - type effects can be wildly oscillatory , and yet tend to integrate to a small net energy .",
    "an obvious question is whether it may be possible to slightly modify the contribution of specific frequency intervals and upset the delicate cancellation between the different positive and negative peaks in figs .",
    "[ fig : casimir ] and [ fig : cp ] . for example , if one could alter the reflectivity of parallel plates just in a selected frequency range , it would seem to be possible to have a casimir force much larger than that between perfectly reflecting plates , and which could be repulsive as well as attractive  @xcite .",
    "a large , repulsive casimir force could have significant industrial applications , such as allowing nearly frictionless bearings .",
    "unfortunately , it is not at all straightforward to enhance casimir forces .",
    "one might replace perfectly reflecting plates by dielectric slabs , which will have a finite , frequency dependent reflectivity .",
    "however , the lifshitz theory  @xcite predicts that the force between two dielectric half - spaces will always be attractive and smaller in magnitude that the force in the perfectly reflecting limit .",
    "at least part of the reason for this is that the dielectric function @xmath23 must satisfy the kramers - kronig relations , which follow from the requirement of analyticity in the upper - half @xmath22 plane .",
    "this analyticity property is in turn a consequence of causality  @xcite .",
    "analyticity constrains @xmath23 in such a way that the contributions of various frequency regions continue to cancel efficiently .",
    "if one were to allow non - analytic dielectric functions , then it becomes possible to construct situations in which the lifshitz thoery predicts repulsive forces  @xcite .",
    "another approach to attempt to enhance casimir forces was taken in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    "the force due to the quantized electromagnetic field on a small dielectric sphere near a perfectly reflecting plate was calculated a quasi - oscillatory result was obtained , which can be either attractive or repulsive , and is much larger in magnitude than the casimir - polder force , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cp ] ) , for a non - dispersive sphere . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the qualitative form of the result does not depend upon whether the plate is perfectly reflecting or not . in both cases .",
    "the sphere was taken to have a plasma model dielectric function , and the resulting force oscillations as a function of distance from the plate have a scale set by the associated plasma wavelength .",
    "one can think of the effect of the sphere s nontrivial frequency response as upsetting the cancellations that occur for a non - dispersive sphere , and which are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] .",
    "if the vacuum modes of the electromagnetic field gave the only contribution to the force on the sphere , then there would be a large repulsive force on the sphere at certain separations which would be large enough to levitate the sphere in the earth s gravitational field , and should be observable .",
    "however , there is another contribution to the net force coming from quantum mechanical fluctuations of the electric charge within the sphere .",
    "this is the effect of what is sometimes called the plasmonic modes .",
    "it was suggested by barton  @xcite that the effect of the plasmonic modes should cancel the quasi - oscillatory terms coming from the vacuum modes .",
    "this suggestion is in fact correct , and was recently confirmed by an explicit calculation  @xcite .",
    "there is still a nonzero net force , but it is always attractive and of the order of magnitude of that for a non - dispersive sphere .",
    "the cancellation occurs only if the sphere plasmon modes are in their ground state .",
    "if they are excited , then the quasi - oscillatory behavior appears in the net force .",
    "this is similar to the case of an atom .",
    "if the atom is in its ground state , then the force is attractive at all separations  @xcite .",
    "if the atom is in an excited state , however , the net force is quasi - oscillatory and typically much larger in magnitude than in the ground state  @xcite .",
    "it is still unclear why the plasmon modes can cancel the effects of the vacuum modes so efficiently , and whether one can engineer materials with repulsive casimir forces without exciting plasma oscillations .",
    "in this section , we will turn to a somewhat different measure of vacuum fluctuations , the probability distribution associated with the fluctuations . first consider the case of a quantity which is linear in a free quantum field .",
    "it is well known that such quantities have a gaussian distribution of probabilities .",
    "however , it will be worthwhile illustrating this result with an explicit example .",
    "let @xmath24 be a free scalar field and let @xmath25 be a smeared field operator averaged over some spacetime region .",
    "the dimension of the spacetime is not relevant here .",
    "we could also include a sampling function @xmath26 and write @xmath27 in place of @xmath28 without changing the result .",
    "next consider the expectation value of a power of @xmath29 in the vacuum state .",
    "all of the odd powers have vanishing expectation value because the @xmath30-point functions vanish for all odd @xmath30 .",
    "that is , @xmath31 where @xmath32 , ect .",
    "however , all of the even moments are nonzero and can be expressed as powers of the second moment , @xmath33 for example , the identity @xmath34 leads to the result @xmath35 this is a special case of the general result @xmath36 the latter result can be obtained from the following counting argument .",
    "wick s theorem allows us to decompose the @xmath37-point function @xmath38 into a sum of products of two - point functions , just as is illustrated in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4point ] ) .",
    "all that we need to know is the number of terms in this sum .",
    "the first contraction of the @xmath37-point function contain @xmath39 terms , as we can select any field to start , and it then has @xmath39 partners with which it can be contracted .",
    "similarly , the contraction of each @xmath40-point function to @xmath41-point functions contains @xmath42 terms , and so on , leading to the factor of @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : moment2n ] ) .",
    "this result for the general even moment implies that the probability distribution is a gaussian function @xmath44 which is confirmed by the facts that @xmath45 and that @xmath46 the result that @xmath47 is a gaussian function is responsible for the prediction of gaussian fluctuations in inflationary cosmology . in most versions of inflation , density perturbations",
    "are linked to the quantum fluctuations of a scalar inflaton field , which is treated as a free field  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a gaussian distribution of density fluctuations , which seems to be consistent with observation  @xcite .    let us now turn to the fluctuations of quadratic operators , such as the smeared stress tensor .",
    "now there is no particular reason to expect the probability distribution to be symmetric , much less gaussian .",
    "in fact , as we will see from an explicit example , the distribution is in general a skewed one .",
    "the example will involve a massive scalar field in two - dimensional minkowski spacetime , but in the limit of a very small mass .",
    "the hadamard function for this field is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the mass and @xmath50 is a neumann function . in the limit of small @xmath49",
    ", this function becomes @xmath51\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is euler s constant .",
    "the commutator function , in the limit that @xmath54 , is @xmath55   = \\frac{i}{4}\\ , \\left [ \\theta(\\delta x - \\delta t )   - \\theta(\\delta x - \\delta t ) \\right]\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "note that the commutator function is finite for @xmath60 , whereas the hadamard function has a logarithmic divergence in this limit .",
    "this is a well - known feature of the massless scalar field in two - dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "this divergence can be removed by selecting a vacuum state which breaks lorentz invariance  @xcite , but here we will assume a small , nonzero mass .",
    "next consider the average of the normal ordered square of @xmath61 over a finite time interval @xmath62 in this model , all of the field operators will be taken to be at the same point in space , so that @xmath63 .",
    "we wish to calculate the vacuum expectation value of various powers of @xmath64 .",
    "begin with the second moment , @xmath65 where the last step follows from wick s theorem . the unsymmetrized two - point function can be written as a sum of the hadamard and commutator functions @xmath66 we can now evaluate the second moment explicitly and find @xmath67 in the limit that @xmath68 . in this limit ,",
    "the hadamard function part of the two - point function gives the leading contribution .",
    "next we turn to the third moment @xmath69 which can be written as @xmath70 in the limit of small @xmath71 , this becomes @xmath72 ^ 3 \\,.\\ ] ] the third moment is positive @xmath73 , and of the same order of magnitude as the second moment in the sense that @xmath74 thus the probability distribution is significantly skewed .",
    "the corresponding calculations for components of the quantum stress tensor have not yet been performed , but it is reasonable to guess that the results will be similar to those of this @xmath75 model in two dimensions .",
    "the technical details are somewhat more complicated , however .",
    "let @xmath76 be the average of the normal - ordered energy density over a spacetime region defined by the non - negative sampling function @xmath26 .",
    "the stress tensor correlation function is singular in the limit of null separated points , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the number of spacetime dimensions .",
    "thus the integral for the second moment @xmath79 will appear to contain a non - integrable singularity .",
    "however , it is possible to define such integrals using an integration by parts procedure  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to use dimensional regularization  @xcite . in both approaches ,",
    "the integral becomes finite .",
    "the third and higher moments can be defined in a similar manner . if @xmath80 , as in the case of the @xmath75 mode , then the probability distribution will again be skewed .",
    "there should be a connection between this distribution and the quantum inequalities which set lower bounds on the expectation value of @xmath81 in non - vacuum states  @xcite . in the case of temporal averaging only , these inequalities are of the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the characteristic width of the sampling function and @xmath84 is a constant .",
    "thus negative energy densities are allowed in quantum field theory , but are tightly constrained .",
    "the lower bound in the expectation value in an arbitrary quantum state , and the lower bound on the probability distribution of fluctuations in the vacuum state are expected to coincide  @xcite .",
    "one way to understand this is to imagine writing the minkowski vacuum state as a superposition of an alternative basis set of states . in each of these states , the measured @xmath81 is bounded below by @xmath85 .",
    "hence the possible fluctuations which can be observed in the minkowski vacuum state are also bounded below by the same value .",
    "if the probability distribution @xmath86 has positive skewness and a finite negative lower bound at @xmath87 , then we can make some general observations on @xmath86 , the first moment is defined to vanish , @xmath88 .",
    "a positive third moment implies a long tail in the positive direction .",
    "thus the greater portion of the area will lie to the left of @xmath89 .",
    "thus a typical measurement of the sampled energy density is more likely to yield a negative than a positive value .",
    "however , when the measured value is positive , its magnitude is likely to be greater than when it is negative .",
    "figure  [ fig : sketch ] is a sketch of a hypothetical probability distribution which satisfies all of these conditions .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the probability distribution for various cases is currently in progress  @xcite .",
    "the non - gaussian nature of quantum stress tensor fluctuations may have applications to inflationary cosmology in the form of a source of a non - gaussian component in the density perturbations .",
