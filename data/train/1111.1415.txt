    "random molecular interactions can have profound effects on gene expression . because the expression of a gene can be regulated by a single promotor , and because the number of mrna copies and protein molecules is often small , deterministic models of gene expression",
    "can miss important behaviors .",
    "a deterministic model might show multiple possible stable behaviors , any of which can be realized depending on the initial conditions of the system .",
    "different stable behavior that depend on initial conditions allows for variability in response and adaptation to environmental conditions @xcite .",
    "although in some cases , noise from multiple sources can push the behavior far from the deterministic model , here we focus on situation where the system fluctuates close to the deterministic trajectory ( i.e. , weak noise ) . of particular interest",
    "is behavior predicted by a stochastic model that is qualitatively different from its deterministic counterpart @xcite , even if the fluctuations are small .",
    "several interesting questions emerge when including stochastic effects in a model of gene expression . for example , what are the different sources of fluctuations affecting a gene circuit ? can noise be harnessed for useful purpose , and if so , what new functions can noise bring to the gene - regulation toolbox ?",
    "one way in which noise can induce qualitatively different behavior occurs when a rare sequence of random events pushes the system far enough away from one of the stable deterministic behaviors that the system transitions toward a different stable dynamic behavior , one that would never be realized in the deterministic model without changing the initial conditions .",
    "for example , if the deterministic model is bistable , fluctuations can cause the protein concentration to shift between the different metastable protein concentrations .",
    "this happens when fluctuations push the system past the unstable fixed point that separates two stable fixed points .",
    "while often times a spontaneous change in gene expression might be harmfull , it might also be beneficial .",
    "for example , in certain types of bacteria , a few individuals within a population enter a slow - growth state in order to resist exposure to antibiotics . in a developing organism",
    ", a population of differentiating cells might first randomly choose between two or more expression profiles during their development and then later segregate into distinct groups by chemotaxis . in both examples , switching between metastable states",
    "leads to mixed populations of phenotypic expression @xcite .",
    "this leads to the question of how cells coordinate and regulate different sources of biochemical fluctuations , or noise , to function within a genetic circuit .    in many cases ,",
    "the genes within a given circuit are turned on and off by regulator proteins , which are often the gene products of the circuit . if a gene is switched on , its dna is transcribed into one or more mrna copies , which are in turn translated into large numbers of proteins . typically , the protein products form complexes with each other or with other proteins that bind to regulatory dna sequences , or operators , to alter the expression state of a gene . for example",
    ", a repressor binds to an operator which blocks the promotor  the region of dna that a polymerase protein binds to before transcribing the gene  so that the gene is turned off and no mrna are transcribed .",
    "this feedback enables a cell to regulate gene expression , and often multiple genes interact within groups to form gene circuits .    understanding how different noise sources affect the behavior of a gene circuit and comparing this with how the circuit behaves with multiple noise sources is essential for understanding how a cell can use different sources of noise productively .",
    "fluctuations arising from the biochemical reactions involving the dna , mrna , and proteins are commonly classified as `` intrinsic '' noise @xcite .",
    "one important source of intrinsic noise is fluctuations from mrna transcription , protein translation , and degradation of both mrna and protein product .",
    "this type of noise is common among many of the biochemical reactions within a cell , and its effect is reduced as the number of reacting species within a given volume grows large .",
    "another source of intrinsic noise is in the expression state of the genes within the circuit .",
    "typically there is only one or two copies of a gene within a cell , which means that thermal fluctuations within reactions with regulatory proteins have a significant effect on mrna production . here , we consider the situation where transitions in the behavior of a gene circuit are primarily driven by fluctuations in the on / off state of its promotor and examine the effect of removing all other sources of noise .",
    "stochastic gene circuits are typically modelled using a discrete markov process , which tracks the random number of mrna and/or proteins along with the state of one or more promotors @xcite ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "monte - carlo simulations using the gillespie algorithm can be used to generate exact realizations of the random process .",
    "the process can also be described by its probability density function , which satisfies a system of linear ordinary differential equations known as the master equation .",
    "the dimension of the master equation is the number of possible states the system can occupy , which can be quite large , leading to the problem of dimensionality when analyzing the master equation directly .",
    "however , for the problem considered here , the full solution to the master equation is not necessary in order to understand metastable transitions .",
    "the motivating biological question we consider here is what percentage of a population of cells can be expected to exhibit a metastable transition within a given timeframe .",
    "if a spontaneous transition is harmfull to the cell , one expects that reaction rates and protein / dna interactions should evolve so that transition times are likely to be much larger than the lifetime of the cell . on the other hand ,",
    "if spontaneous transition are functional , transition times should be tuned to achieve the desired population in which the transition occurs . in either case",
    ", the key quantity of interest is the distribution of transition times between metastable states , regardless of the noise source driving the transition .    except for a few special cases @xcite exact results , even for the mean transition time , are not possible and approximation techniques or monte - carlo simulations",
    "must be used .",
    "however , because rare events typically involve long simulation times where large numbers of jumps occur , monte - carlo simulations are computationally expensive to perform , leaving perturbation analysis ideally suited for the task .",
    "past studies of metastable transitions , where perturbation methods are applied to the master equation , have used a simplifying assumption so that the state of the promotor is not accounted for explicitly @xcite .",
    "the assumption is that proteins are produced in `` bursts '' during which one or more mrna copies are translated to rapidly produce many proteins . in these models ,",
    "production bursts occur as instantaneous jumps , with a predefined distribution determining the number of proteins produced during a given burst .",
    "more recently , assaf and coworkers analyzed a model where the on / off state of a single stochastic promotor is accounted for explicitly , and mrna copies are produced stochastically at a certain rate when the promotor is turned on @xcite .",
    "however , the case where the model contains an arbitrary number of promotors or promotor states has not been addressed , and as we show in this paper , accounting for even just three promotor states is nontrivial .",
    "similar asymptotic methods have also been developed to study metastable transitions in continuous markov processes @xcite , but can not be applied to a discrete chemical reaction system because continuous approximations , such as the system - size expansion , of discrete markov processes do not , in general , accurately capture transition times @xcite .",
    "another source of difficulty that arises from isolating promotor state fluctuations as the only source of noise is that the resulting state space of the markov process is both continuous and discrete .    after removing all sources of intrinsic noise except for the fluctuating promotor  by taking the thermodynamic limit ",
    "the protein levels change deterministically and continuously , and the promotor s state jumps at exponentially - distributed random times .",
    "the random jumps in the promotor s state makes the protein levels appear random , even though they are only responding deterministically to changes in the promotor state .",
    "such random processes are sometimes called hybrid systems , or piecewise deterministic @xcite . here",
    "we refer to it as the quasi - deterministic ( qd ) process because we are taking part of the randomly fluctuating discrete state of the system ( the number of protein molecules ) and replacing it with a deterministically - changing continuous state .",
    "recently , we have developed asymptotic methods for metastable transitions ",
    "similar to those applied to the discrete master equation  for markov processes with both discrete and continuous state spaces @xcite .",
    "however , these methods do not account for two or more continuous state variables , which restricts the genetic circuit the method can analyze to one with a single protein product .    in this paper",
    ", we develop new perturbation methods so that we can study metastable transitions in genetic circuits driven by promotor fluctuations .",
    "these methods are based on previous theory developed for one - dimensional velocity jump processes , and are generalized to account for the multiple continuous states representing the quantity of proteins produced by the genetic circuit .",
    "they also fit within a larger framework of methods to study metastable transitions in continuous markov processes @xcite and in discrete markov processes @xcite . for illustration",
    ", we use a simple model known as the `` mutual repressor '' model @xcite , which contains two genes , two promotors , and three promotor states .",
    "although our example considers only three promotor states , the methods presented are general and can account for an arbitrary number of promotor states . for a range of parameter values , the deterministic limit of the mutual repressor model",
    "is bistable , having two stable fixed points separated by an unstable saddle point . for the stochastic model ,",
    "the deterministic forces create two confining wells surrounding each stable fixed point , separated by a stability barrier along the separatrix that contains the unstable saddle .",
    "this geometric interpretation is given by taking the logarithm of the stationary probability density function , which we refer as the `` stability landscape . ''",
    "an approximation of the first exit time density is found for the random process to escape over the stability barrier from one of the stability wells to the other . using this model",
    ", we seek to answer the following question . how does the random process change when protein noise is removed , leaving the state of the promotor as the only source of randomness ?",
    "that is , are there any qualitative differences in the behavior of the system without other sources of intrinsic noise ?    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "the mutual repressor model is presented along with its reduction to the qd process , and then in section [ sec : trt ] , perturbation methods for estimating the exit time density are applied to the qd process . for comparison ,",
    "the stability landscape is also computed for the full process in section [ sec : full ] , which includes fluctuations in protein production / degradation .",
    "finally , results are presented in section [ sec : results ] , and the qd process is compared to the full process , using analytical / numerical approximations and monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the mutual repressor model @xcite is a hypothetical gene circuit consisting of a single promotor driving the expression of two genes : @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "each protein product can dimerize and bind to the promotor to repress the expression of the other .",
    "when no dimer is bound to the promotor , both genes are expressed equally .",
    "thus , the promotor can be in one of three states : bound to a dimer of protein one @xmath2 , unbound @xmath3 , or bound to a dimer of protein two @xmath4 .",
    "let the number of protein product of gene @xmath0 and @xmath1 be @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that the mrna and protein production steps can be combined into a single protein production rate and that the dimerization reaction is fast so that it can be taken to be in quasi - steady - state .",
    "we then have the following transition between the three promotor states @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a rate and @xmath9 is a nondimensional dissociation constant . protein @xmath0 ( @xmath1 )",
    "is produced at a rate @xmath10 while the promotor is in states @xmath11",

    "because we have two small parameters in our system , @xmath35 and @xmath40 , when perusing an asymptotic solution , we must carefully consider how the limit @xmath41 and @xmath42 is taken , or more practically , how large @xmath40 is compared to @xmath35 .",
    "the fluctuations in the promotor state are controlled by @xmath40 , and in the limit @xmath41 , the transitions are infinitely fast so that the promotor behaves deterministically .",
    "the fluctuations in protein levels is controlled by @xmath35 , and in the limit @xmath42 the protein production / degradation behaves deterministically .",
    "since we are concerned primarily with rare transitions driven by promotor fluctuations and not by fluctuations in the protein production / degradation reaction , we assume that @xmath43 ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) .",
    "taking both limits , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , yields the fully - deterministic dynamics , @xmath47 where @xmath48 note the symmetry in the problem ; the deterministic system is unchanged if we exchange @xmath49 .",

    "a stochastic trajectory that starts at the lower stable fixed point remains nearby for a long period of time until a rare sequence of jumps carries it to the separatrix . because the separatrix is the stable manifold , trajectories are most likely to exit near the unstable saddle point .",
