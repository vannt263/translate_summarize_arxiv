    "the recent results of the super kamiokande ( super k ) water cerenkov - detector experiment @xcite provide firm indications of an anomaly in the flavor ratios and zenith - angle dependence of the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "although the existence of such an anomaly had already been signalled by earlier data from the kamiokande @xcite and imb @xcite experiments and supported by subsequent soudan ii results @xcite , the impressive statistical significance of the super k data has appreciably buttressed its interpretation in terms neutrino mass and oscillations .",
    "this is especially true of the observed zenith angle dependence of the observations , which does not naturally seem to lend itself to any alternative explanation . when combined with results from the chooz reactor experiment @xcite , analyses @xcite of the data tilt the balance towards an interpretation in terms of @xmath6 oscillations versus other explanations .",
    "evidence that this channel is favoured also comes from neutral current event count ratios involving the production of neutral pions measured at super k @xcite .",
    "in addition to being the first firm signal for physics beyond the standard model , a determination , even if approximate , of neutrino masses and mixing angles would be a crucial pointer towards the nature of such physics , providing an unprecedented glimpse into what lies beyond present knowledge of particle interactions .",
    "thus , the importance of independently verifying the presence of @xmath6 oscillations can scarcely be overestimated .",
    "the firmest confirmation of this hypothesis would be via the detection of @xmath7 leptons produced by charged current interactions of @xmath8 s resulting from oscillations of @xmath9 s . in this paper",
    ", we study this possibility in the context of neutrinos obtained from muon storage rings at future muon colliders .    at present , high energy ( @xmath10 gev ) neutrino beams for oscillation studies are obtained by allowing charged pions and kaons produced in fixed target accelerator experiments to decay in flight .",
    "recently , however , a new type of neutrino beam , much more intense than those presently available , has been proposed and discussed for neutrino oscillation studies and other neutrino related experiments @xcite .",
    "these beams originate from a high intensity muon source , currently under active design and study as part of an effort to develop a high luminosity muon collider @xcite .",
    "in addition to the extremely intense and collimated primary neutrino fluxes which will be available from such a source , the beam compositions will be much more precisely known than in those available from pion and kaon decay .",
    "a muon storage ring with the straight section pointing towards a neutrino detector situated at a specific baseline length , as described in detail in @xcite , would lead to a neutrino beam with precisely equal numbers of @xmath9 and @xmath11 , or alternatively @xmath12 and @xmath13 , depending on the sign of parent muons .",
    "this is in contrast to the presently available high energy neutrino beams from accelerators , which contain mostly muon neutrinos , but with small contaminations of electron and tau neutrino species . for @xmath0 appearance searches , the vastly superior luminosities ,",
    "absence of contamination and the possibility of higher energies of muon collider neutrino beams make them an attractive proposal which merits further study .",
    "accordingly , we focus here on the physics of tau appearance experiments using neutrinos from muon storage rings , depicting the two flavour oscillation parameter ranges ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) which can be consequently probed in a search for @xmath6 and @xmath16 oscillations .    adopting the sample design configuration for muon production , capture , cooling ,",
    "acceleration and storage prior to decay described in @xcite , the number of available muons of either sign is @xmath17 per year .",
    "of these , one fourth decay in a straight section directed towards the neutrino detector , yielding @xmath18 neutrinos and an identical number of anti - neutrinos @xmath19 and @xmath20 , if , for example , the beam is comprised of @xmath21 we use these numbers in all of the following calculations , and refer the reader to @xcite for design details leading to the production of the neutrino beams .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the broader physics characteristics and dependences of @xmath7 production rates at such oscillation experiments . in section 3",
    "we discuss the realistic detection of @xmath7 events above backgrounds .",
    "the channels we study are the detection of ( i ) @xmath6 oscillations via charge current production and subsequent decay into hadrons , and ( ii ) @xmath22 oscillations via the appearance of wrong sign muons from @xmath7 decay to leptonic modes .",
    "the specific conventional kt type detector , discussed recently in @xcite is considered , and we describe our choices for the kinematic cuts and/or overall detection efficiencies for it .",
    "in section 4 we use the results of the consequent event rate calculations to present 90@xmath23 cl contours for @xmath24 and @xmath25 for a variety of muon beam energies and baseline lengths in order to illustrate the extraordinary possibilities offered by muon colliders for studying neutrino oscillations .",
    "for the general discussion that this section focuses on , we compute and use the actual @xmath27 charged current ( cc ) production rates without including experimental cuts to eliminate backgrounds .",
    "these are detailed and incorporated later , in sections 3 and 4 , prior to obtaining contour plots for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    the event rate @xmath30 ( events / kt / year ) for @xmath7 lepton production from @xmath9 s subsequent to oscillation is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total charged current cross section obtained by integrating equation ( [ eq3 ] ) below .",
    "the oscillation probability between flavours is @xmath33 \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] with @xmath34 in ev@xmath35 , @xmath36 baseline length in km , @xmath37 being the neutrino energy in gev , and @xmath38 the mixing angle between flavours .",
    "@xmath39 is the number of neutrinos in the cone intercepted by the detector averaged over its area .",
    "the numerical factor is the number of scatterers ( iso -scalar nucleons ) per kt of the detector material .",
    "we first discuss the cross - section , performing our calculation within the renormalization group improved parton model , and focus on the inclusive process @xmath40 anything , where @xmath41 is an isoscalar nucleon . on retaining effects of the @xmath7-mass ,- mass , in the case of @xmath42 , which is also calculated below . clearly , however , the terms proportional to the square of the lepton mass in eqs . (",
    "3 ) and ( 4 ) are important at the energies of interest for only the @xmath7-lepton . ]",
    "the differential cross section can be written in terms of the bjorken scaling variables @xmath43 and @xmath44 as @xmath45\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath46 is the invariant momentum transfer between the incident neutrino and outgoing tau , @xmath47 is the energy loss in the lab ( target ) frame , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the nucleon and intermediate boson masses respectively , and @xmath50 gev@xmath51 is the fermi constant .",
    "the limits on @xmath52 and @xmath53 are @xmath54 where @xmath55\\right\\vert^{1\\over2}/\\left (   1+x{m\\over 2 e_\\nu}\\right).\\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath56 s are given as @xmath57    a straightforward application of the callan - gross equations shows that @xmath58 vanishes in this case . in the above , _ u , d , c , s _ and _ b _ denote the distributions for the various quark flavours in a proton . for our calculations we use cteq4 parton distributions @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the total cc cross sections for @xmath9 and @xmath0 , obtained using the above expressions . for convenience ,",
    "we give analytic fits for both cross - sections in table [ table1 ] , over the entire range of energy which is of interest here .",
    "for the calculations of event rates , we assume that area dimensions of the detector and the baseline length @xmath59 define a detection cone of half angle @xmath60 with the direction of the muon beam , with detector radius @xmath61 .",
    "thus , for long baselines the choice of @xmath62 would expectedly be smaller than those for shorter baselines in order to accommodate a realistic detector size .",
    "the angular distribution of @xmath9 within a chosen detection cone , of course , follows from the decay kinematics of muon , and is obtained by boosting the familiar distribution of a muon decaying at rest to the requisite beam energy .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows , for various beam energies , the angular distribution @xmath63 in the polar angle @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the number of muon neutrinos ( prior to any oscillation ) contained within a cone of half - angle @xmath64 , demonstrating the expected forward peaking of muon neutrinos with increasing parent particle energy .",
    "this distribution peaks around @xmath66 radians for @xmath67 gev , around @xmath68 radians for @xmath69 gev , and even higher for @xmath70 50 and 20 gev .",
    "we remark here that for the wrong - sign muon detection mode discussed and used below , the parent @xmath71 angular distribution differs from the @xmath9 distribution shown here , as dictated by decay kinematics .",
    "next , we note that the oscillation probability in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) reduces to @xmath72 for @xmath73 , and that this condition is satisfied for a significant range of @xmath74 values , even for large baseline lengths , given the high energies contemplated for muon colliders . it is , for instance , valid for the favoured value of super k results , @xmath75 ev@xmath35 , @xmath76 , even for a relatively low 20 gev muon beam and a 732 km baseline .",
    "since the average flux intercepted by a detector for some fixed @xmath62 falls as @xmath77 , from equation ( [ eq1 ] ) we see that @xmath30 will be independent of baseline length as long as equation ( [ eq5 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this independence is illustrated in figure [ fig3 ] , where the tau events /kt / yr are plotted versus baseline lengths for three different values of @xmath62 , for a 250 gev muon beam energy and @xmath78 ev@xmath35 .",
    "subsequent to oscillation , and when the detector area is taken into account , the enhanced collimation of the neutrinos with increasing beam energy manifests itself in an interesting manner . in general , for a significant part of the range of the energies of interest at muon colliders , @xmath79 rises linearly with neutrino energy . for our choice of oscillation parameters ,",
    "the probability @xmath80 varies with energy as @xmath81 in equation ( [ eq5 ] ) , while the forward peaking of the neutrino beam with energy enhances the flux term as @xmath82 , leading to an overall linear increase in the event rate with energy for a detector of fixed mass whose area matches that of the kinematic decay cone at each energy . in practice , of course , @xmath59 and @xmath83 ( which fix @xmath62 ) and @xmath84 depend on and are constrained by various factors like geographical location of existing facilities , physics goals , cost and design considerations .",
    "it is thus useful to examine the behaviour of the @xmath7 production event rate when , for instance , @xmath59 and @xmath83 are fixed and @xmath84 is varied , with a view to optimization .    in figure ( [ fig4 ] )",
    "we plot the tau event - rate for @xmath85 radians , @xmath86 ev@xmath35 , @xmath87 and baseline length l= 732 km .",
    "( the choice of baseline is appropriate to a proposed beam from either cern to gran sasso @xcite or from fermilab to the soudan laboratory @xcite . ) after the initial rise with energy , it peaks around @xmath88 gev , and then falls and flattens asymptotically with increasing energy . as the position of this peak with respect to @xmath89 depends on @xmath62 alone , it will remain invariant under changes of @xmath90 and @xmath29 , as long as eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) remains a good approximation .",
    "figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] compare the yields per kt - yr for various detection cones , respectively , as beam energy and @xmath28 are varied . for low beam energies where forward peaking of the decay products is not pronounced ,",
    "narrower detection cones contain fewer events / kt / yr , but for higher energies the behaviour is reversed ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "for instance , a detector which subtends a @xmath91 radians cone will see roughly 11 times more events / kt / year for @xmath92 gev than one subtending @xmath85 radians , since it intercepts a higher average flux @xmath93 .",
    "the assumption of a uniform flux over the area of the detector can thus be misleading , since the event rate scales very non - linearly with the detector area . in figure ( [ fig6 ] ) , the rise in the event - rate as @xmath94 signalled by equations ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq1 ] ) in conjunction is clearly apparent upto @xmath28 values of @xmath95 ev@xmath35 , after which the sinusoidal behaviour sets in .    in conclusion ,",
    "as illustrated by figures [ fig2 ] - [ fig6 ] , @xmath7 event rates from @xmath9 beams at muon colliders have several interesting characteristics which are relevant to experimental design and choice of baseline length and beam energy :    1 .   for a substantial and physically interesting range of @xmath74 , the event rate ( events / kt / year ) for a fixed @xmath62",
    "is to a very good approximation independent of baseline length for a wide range of beam energies ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "2 .   for a given choice of say ,",
    "baseline and detector area @xmath96 fixed @xmath97 , the event rate is maximised at a particular beam energy , independent of the particular values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 over a considerable portion of their range ( figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "3 .   the intense",
    "forward peaking expectedly renders detectors with smaller area superior to those with large area at high beam energies , for a fixed available mass of the detector , and we show the extent to which this affects actual event rates in figure ( [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "an important component of any study for @xmath7 appearance due to @xmath98 oscillations is the event selection strategy for the @xmath7 s produced from charged current interactions of the @xmath99 .",
    "this has been discussed in the literature in the context of several terrestrial experiments that are already in progress @xcite , @xcite .",
    "strategies for @xmath7-detection have also received consideration in proposals for future experiments @xcite , @xcite .    for neutrino experiments using a muon storage ring , the detailed prescription for event selection",
    "can be formulated only after the detector design is specified .",
    "there are , however , some basic issues concerning the signals and the backgrounds which all experiments are likely to be concerned with .",
    "we base our predictions here on these considerations , implemented within a parton - level monte carlo calculation .",
    "the results presented by us are in connection with a detector of mass 10 kt similar to that described in @xcite , placed perpendicularly to the muon beam axis , with a short , medium or large baseline , incorporating detailed tracking and particle identification facilities .",
    "we have based our first set of calculations on tau - detection through the one - prong hadronic decay channels .",
    "this essentially includes the decays @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , with small additional contributions from the @xmath103 and @xmath104 channels @xcite .",
    "the @xmath105 subsequently decays into @xmath106 . for the decay of @xmath107 ,",
    "we have confined ourselves to the mode @xmath108 which leads to a single charged - track .",
    "the branching ratios into these channels @xcite are approximately 11@xmath23 , 25@xmath23 and 9@xmath23 respectively , giving a substantial total branching ratio of about @xmath109 .",
    "thus , essentially one should look for one charged pionic track with 0 , 1 or 2 neutral pions in a collinear configuration .",
    "the total energy , measured from deposits in the electro - magnetic and hadronic calorimeters gives the energy of the @xmath110 , @xmath105 or @xmath111 , which can be combined with the directional information to construct its three - momentum .",
    "the backgrounds for signals of this kind ( kinks in the charged tracks with missing @xmath112 ) can come , for example , from re - interaction of the hadronic jets coming out of the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) vertex , particularly in the case of neutral current events .",
    "charmed particle production and decays in the dis processes can also give rise to potential backgrounds .",
    "there is also the possibility of muons ( from charged current events with no oscillation ) being misidentified as pions . and",
    "finally , one can have the so - called ` white kinks ' arising from one - prong nuclear interactions with no heavy ionising tracks .",
    "( these types of kinks usually have small @xmath112 , within about 500 mev for our energy ranges . )    with the above considerations in mind , our first set of results ( for a 10 kt detector ) implements the following event selection criteria for a 250 gev muon beam @xcite :    * a minimum @xmath113 of 0.5 gev . * a minimum energy of 2 gev for the one - prong decay products from the tau s . * a minimum isolation of @xmath114 = 0.7 between the charged prong from tau - decay and the dis products , where @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 being the differences in pseudo - rapidity and azimuthal angle respectively .",
    "the last criterion ensures that the one - prong charged tracks characteristic of @xmath7-decays are at such angles with the beam axis as to set them clearly apart from misidentified muons produced from unoscillated @xmath9 s as well as from white kinks . at lower ( higher ) energies",
    ", the @xmath113 cut has to be slightly reduced ( enhanced ) in order to suppress backgrounds with the same effectiveness .",
    "we find that the missing-@xmath112 and isolation cuts taken together can remove the entire set of backgrounds due to unoscillated charged - current events , whereas the neutral current backgrounds are adequately taken care of by the isolation cuts .",
    "taking everything together , the approximate efficiency of tau detection in our parton - level calculation turns out to be 31@xmath23 ( including the branching ratio for one - prong decays ) .",
    "this is commensurate with the efficiencies expected in , for example , the opera experiment @xcite .",
    "our second set of results is based on tau appearance due to @xmath118 oscillating into @xmath119 .",
    "these will lead to wrong - sign muons via charged current interactions .",
    "such signals are relatively background - free ; the only significant backgrounds come from charm production at the dis vertex . for this set of our results",
    "we have    * a minimum @xmath113 of 0.2 gev .",
    "* a minimum energy of 2 gev for the wrong sign charged lepton decaying from tau ( muon and electron ) . * a minimum transverse momentum of wrong sign muon / electron @xmath120 of 0.2 gev * a minimum isolation of @xmath114 = 0.4 between the wrong sign charged lepton from tau - decay and the dis products .    finally , although our focus here is on @xmath7 appearance , we also give results in section 4 for the detection of @xmath121 oscilations , detectable again by the presence of wrong sign muons , after implementing suitable cuts .",
    "in order to demonstrate the possibilities offered by muon storage rings for oscillation studies , we give the corresponding @xmath3 c.l .",
    "contours for @xmath24 and @xmath25 for two - flavour mixing .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we feel this is adequate at present to obtain a firm feel for the eventual potential of these experiments to comprehensively map the parameter space of neutrino masses and mixing .    starting with equation ( [ eq1 ] ) for @xmath30 , the bare events , and folding in the kinematic cuts described above for event selection and background elimination , one obtains @xmath123 , representing the actual candidate events . requiring @xmath124",
    "then delineates the @xmath3 c.l . parameter space .",
    "thus , for each contour the average value of the probability @xmath125 where @xmath126 is computed from equation ( [ eq1 ] ) by setting @xmath127 , representing total conversion of @xmath9 s to @xmath0 s , but imposing the cuts as before . also , we note that @xcite for each contour , the reach in @xmath28 , _ i.e. _ its minimum value , occurring when @xmath87 is given to a good approximation by @xmath128 since @xmath126 scales as the product of the flux and the cross - section , ( having the probability term set to 1 ) , it follows that @xmath129 similarly , the knee for each contour , _",
    "i.e. _ the minimum value of @xmath29 probed occurs when the other oscillating term in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) is approximately 1 , hence @xmath130 which implies that @xmath131 finally , the vertical asymptotic part of the contour , occurring when the values of @xmath132 are high enough such that the sine squared term containing it in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) averages to @xmath133 has @xmath134    figures [ fig7],[fig8],[fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] show contours for @xmath7 lepton detection via decay modes containing hadronic final states , for muon beam energies of @xmath135 gev , @xmath136 gev , @xmath137 and @xmath138 gev at @xmath3 c.l . for a 10 kt - yr detector , assuming a detection cone of @xmath139 milli radians .",
    "each figure has contours for three different baselines , @xmath138 km ( kamioka to kek ) , @xmath140 km ( cern to gran sasso or fermilab to soudan ) and @xmath141 km ( fermilab to japan ) . figures [ fig11],[fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] show curves for the same choices of baselines and other parameters , but for energies of @xmath136 gev , @xmath137 gev and 250 gev and for the wrong sign lepton detection for @xmath142 oscillation . for a muon beam energy of @xmath135 gev , no wrong - sign muon events survive our ( conservative ) cuts .    in the regions corresponding to small mass - squared differences ,",
    "all the contours for a given energy tend to merge .",
    "this again demonstrates the insensitivity to baseline in these regions . the scaling relation for @xmath143 with length ( for a fixed beam energy ) ( equation ( [ eq10 ] ) )",
    "is also reproduced well in the contours .",
    "once one compares different energies , however , the scaling is distorted by the presence of energy - dependant cuts and also marginally by the fact that the plots here are for muon beam energies , while the scaling relations are for neutrino energies .",
    "it is apparent from equations ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) and from the contours that very long baselines offer no advantages for oscillation studies employing neutrinos from muon storage rings , and carry the added burden of impractical detector sizes , at least if conventional detectors are employed .",
    "the dramatic potential for oscillation studies is apparent .",
    "even a modest @xmath135 gev beam energy is capable of effectively mapping the @xmath144 parameter space indicated by super k , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath145 and @xmath146 , as can be seen from fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "as expected from equation ( [ eq10 ] ) , shorter baselines provide an enhanced reach in @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) , for the same beam energy and reach in @xmath28 . for @xmath144 searches ,",
    "muon storage rings provide the potential to greatly exceed limits set by present and past accelerator experiments ( nomad , chorus , cdhs , ccfr and e531 ) @xcite . at present",
    ", bounds on this oscillation mode cover the range @xmath149 and @xmath150 ev@xmath35 .",
    "beam energies of @xmath137 gev and a baseline of 250 km would allow exploration upto @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( figure [ fig9 ] ) . similarly , the wrong - sign muon mode contours ( figures [ fig11],[fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] ) demonstrate the potential for extending the limits explored for @xmath153 parameters .",
    "current bounds from accelerator and reactor based experiments ( nomad , ccfr , bugey and chooz ) @xcite go down to @xmath154 ev@xmath35 and @xmath155 .",

    "the distortion of the scaling relations equations ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) due to the presence of experimental cuts is apparent here , being more pronounced at low beam energies . for 20 gev and 50 gev , ( figure ( [ fig14 ] ) ) for instance",
    ", @xmath158 scales as @xmath159 rather than @xmath160 .    finally ,",
    "although our focus here has been the detection of @xmath0 appearance , the experiments discussed here are in a natural position to also study @xmath121 oscillations .",
    "the parameter regions which can be explored are shown in figure [ fig18 ] , after incorporating appropriate cuts to remove backgrounds for the wrong - sign muons .",
    "clearly , the region identified by the lsnd experiment @xcite can be scrutinised with ease at muon storage rings .",
    "we have studied the possibilities offered by muon storage rings ( at various muon beam energies and baselines ) for @xmath0 appearance experiments in order to determine masses and mixing angles for @xmath1 and @xmath161 oscillations .",
