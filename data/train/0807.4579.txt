    "observational and numerical studies suggest that dynamical interactions are frequent occurrences in clusters of galaxies and that these events are the most energetic in the recent history of the universe .",
    "matter is believed to stream along preferred axes ( so - called filaments and sheets ) often accelerating in - falling galaxies to velocities of the order of 10@xmath2 km s@xmath3 .",
    "rich clusters form at the intersection of the filament and sheets , and larger mass congregations , such as superclusters , are often detected as a collection of several clusters and filaments . these dynamical processes cause shocks , turbulence and bulk flows along the filamentary axes resulting in disturbance of the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "such perturbations are frequently detected with x - ray observations which show a variety of features including sharp temperature jumps , distorted x - ray isophotes and regions of enhanced pressure and entropy . at radio wavelengths , cluster mergers",
    "are thought to generate large areas of diffuse synchrotron emission either as a central , unpolarised halo or one or occasionally two peripheral `` radio relics '' .",
    "cluster `` weather '' and bulk flows have also been cited as causes of the bending of the jets in head - tail galaxies ( burns et al .",
    "1998 , johnston - hollitt et al .  2004 ) , although recent results suggest that more local conditions might play a more important role in their formation ( mao et al .  2008 ) .",
    "in addition to the large - area phenomena discussed above , the dynamical history of galaxy clusters should also be imprinted on the constituent galaxies . in particular , increased secondary star formation either observed in the optical ( burns et al .",
    "1994 ; caldwell & rose 1997 ) or through increased low - power radio emission ( owen et al .",
    "1999 ) is one possible signature of the history of a dynamical cluster .",
    "however , the balance between mergers driving gas towards the centre of the galaxies and hence feeding the central agn to induce a starburst ( bekki 1999 ) and an increase in the ram pressure which would strip gas from galaxies and hence curtail the feeding of the agn ( e.g. balogh et al .  1998 ;",
    "fujita et al .",
    "1999 ) still needs to be addressed observationally . to date",
    ", few studies have been conducted with both sufficient sensitivity in the radio to probe the low - powered radio sources , and good optical observations to confirm cluster membership .",
    "the most notable progress to date has been made on sections of the shapley supercluster with several areas analysed in both the radio and optical , including radio observations of a3556 ( venturi et al .",
    "1997 ) , a3571 ( venturi et al .",
    "2002 ) , the a3528 complex ( venturi et al .",
    "2001 ) and the a3558 complex ( venturi et al .  2001 ; miller 2005 ) and its outskirts ( giacintucci et al .  2004 , miller 2005 ) .",
    "in addition to clusters in superclusters , the host radio population for several individual clusters have also been examined including a2255 ( miller & owen , 2005 ) , a2256 ( miller et al .",
    "2003 ) , a2125 ( owen et al .",
    "2005 ) and a2111 ( miller et al .",
    "however , at present , those observational studies that have been undertaken give incomplete results with both instances in which effects are seen on the radio population , and cases where they are not observed . sometimes neighbouring clusters in the same supercluster show markedly different results in terms of radio population .",
    "this may well be due to the radio galaxy population only being affected in certain phases of dynamical activity ( venturi et al .",
    "2002 ) however , the exact point at which a merger might affect the radio population is , as yet , unclear .",
    "nevertheless , large - area observations of superclusters , such as shapley , present ideal datasets with which to investigate the way in which environment affects the galaxy population .    in this paper , which will be the first in a series , we present a study of the radio population of a3158 which lies within the kinematic core of the massive horologium - reticulum supercluster ( hrs ) .",
    "the hrs spans around 180 square degrees on the sky ( fleenor et al .",
    "2006 ) , contains upwards of 20 galaxy clusters ( zucca et al .",
    "1993 ) , is comprised of at least two major filaments ( einasto et al .",
    "2003 ) , and is the second largest mass concentration in the local 300 mpc ( hudson et al .",
    "a3158 lies adjacent to the so - called center of the hrs , defined by the double cluster complex a3125/a3128 ( rose et al .",
    "2002 ) . the paper will be laid out as follows : section 2 will discuss a3158 in detail ; section 3 will give details of the radio observations of the cluster ; section 4 will present the radio source population and in sections 5 and 6 we will discuss the resultant radio source counts and radio luminosity functions ; sections 7 & 8 will present the discussion and conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we will assume h@xmath4=71 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 which at the average redshift of a3158 ( z=0.0597 ) means that 1 arcsecond @xmath5 1.1 kpc .    [ optp ]",

    "several studies have been conducted to examine the way in which the cluster environment affects the radio galaxy population either via composite studies such as that undertaken in ledlow and owen ( 1996 ) , `` lo96 '' , or detailed studies of individual clusters or regions .",
    "unfortunately , the results of the individual studies are often conflicting , possibly as a result of low number statistics , however some clear trends are emerging with respect to the three main indicators of the status of the radio population : source counts , radio luminosity functions and colour analysis of faint excesses . of these",
    ", source counts provide an effective way to search for enhancements over the expected background . to date",
    "there have been several source count studies undertaken for parts of the shapley supercluster ( venturi et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 , 2001 , 2002 ) all of which have returned results which are consistent with the predicted background suggesting that the increased optical density of the supercluster environment is not at all reflected in the radio galaxy population .",
    "however , all of these studies have been relativity shallow , typically only examining sources with log p@xmath6 @xmath7 21.8 and are thus , barely probing the regime of starforming galaxies .",
    "the situation with radio luminosity functions and in particular those for early - type galaxies seems to be complex .",
    "venturi et al .  ( 1997 ) examined the rlf for a3556 in shapley and found it to be consistent with that found in other environments , hence concluding that , in this case , the dynamical state of the cluster played no role in the likelihood of radio galaxies forming .",
    "however , in a further study venturi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) presented a detailed study of the a3558 complex in the center of the shapley supercluster finding that neither local nor the cluster environment played a significant role in the power distribution of radio sources in the region .",
    "therefore , venturi et al .  ( 2000 ) conclude that the probability of forming low - powered radio sources ( log p@xmath8 22.5 ) in shapley is lower than in both the field and ( composite ) cluster environments .",
    "furthermore , they suggest that cluster merging switches off previously active radio galaxies , i.  e.  , mergers anti - correlate with radio emission in early - type galaxies .",
    "next they examined the a3528 cluster complex in shapley again finding that the rlf was consistent with that found in other environments ( venturi et al .",
    "finally , they considered the radio emission in a3571 ( venturi et al .  2002 ) again finding that it was suppressed with respect to the expected results from lo96 .",
    "giacintucci et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reobserved the outskirts of the a3558 complex and found the rlfs for both early and late - type galaxies to be consistent with the  universal \" rlfs of ledlow and owen ( 1996 ) and gavazzi & boselli ( 1999 ) respectively , suggesting that the deficit of radio galaxies in the previous observation was entirely due to the rich cluster a3558 itself .",
    "venturi et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) attribute the difference in the rlfs to different stages in the merger history of the regions playing a critical role in the determination of radio emission in cluster galaxies . in the case of early mergers",
    "suggested for a3556 and the a3528 complex they suggested that the radio galaxy population has not yet been affected , whereas for the late - stage merger in a3571 and a3558 , in the very core of shapley , the radio galaxy population has been switched off by the merging .",
    "given that cluster mergers are particularly long lived ( @xmath5 gyr ) compared to the lifetimes of radio sources which are typically only 10@xmath9 -10@xmath10 years it seems likely that the radio population could give vital clues as to the exact point in a cluster s dynamical history , thus providing to be an extremely important evolutionary indicator .",
    "this is particularly true if the radio emission is considered together with other signposts of cluster dynamics such as x - ray observations .    despite not being evident via an excess in source counts , giacintucci et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found a population of low powered ( log p@xmath11 22 ) galaxies on the outskirts of the a3558 complex , many of which showed a blue excess which they suggested are likely to be starbursts , although they noted that their observations provided only weak evidence that the fraction of radio - emitting galaxies was higher than in non - merging environments .",
    "miller ( 2005 ) conducted a deeper observations of the a3558 complex over 7 deg@xmath12 and , on the basis of colour and radio luminosity , confirmed the presence of an increased starforming population associated with the recent merging of sc 1329 - 313 and a3562 with the rest of the supercluster .",
    "an excess of low - powered blue galaxies was also observed in the merging clusters a2125 ( owen et al .",
    "2005 ) , a2255 ( miller et al .",
    "2003 ) and in a2111 ( miller et al .",
    "2006 ) which despite lacking statistical evidence of substructure at right angles to the plane of the sky , is likely to be dynamically active . in both cases",
    "the authors attribute the excess of dusty starburst galaxies to the merger activity . in all cases",
    "an increase in low - power , blue galaxies either confirmed via spectroscopic analysis as starburst ( owen et al .",
    "2005 ) or assumed through colour analysis ( giacintucci et al .",
    "2004 ) has been associated with recently merging clusters .    in the case of a3158",
    "we see both an excess of low - powered radio galaxies ( log p@xmath1 22 ) in the source counts and a suppression of the early - type rlf with respect to universal indicators .",
    "thus , we seem to be seeing both a suppression of agn as observed in the late mergers in a3571 and a3558 ( venturi et al .  2000 and 2002 ) and an increase in the low - powered , blue galaxies , likely to be starbursts , as seen in the mergers for a2125 , a2255 , a2111 ( owen et al .",
    "2005 , miller et al .",
    "2003 & miller et al .",
    "2006 respectively ) and the outskirts of a3558 ( giacintucci et al .",
    "in addition , the axis of the starforming galaxy candidates is elongated and aligned in the direction which connects a3158 to the more massive a3125/a3128 complex which lies at the southern centre of the hrs .",
    "this is similar to the distribution of star - forming galaxies seen in a2125 .",
    "additionally the lack of ht galaxies is similar to both a3571 and a3558 and was used by venturi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to argue for these clusters being in the later stages of a dynamical encounter .",
    "we present the the first of a series of papers investigating radio emission in the horologium - reticulum supercluster . in this paper",
    "we present radio imaging at 1.4 and 2.5 ghz of the cluster a3158 , from which we detect 109 radio sources of which 64 are found to have optical counterparts . by considering a reduced subsample of 87 sources within a @xmath13 radius , over which the primary beam attenuation of the atca is negligible , we are able to investigate the statistical properties of radio emission in the cluster .",
    "our results can be summarised as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the radio source counts in a3158 are unlikely to be consistent with the background source counts and in particular there appears to be an excess of galaxies with s@xmath14 3.96 mjy ; a ks test of the entire sample against the background only returns a @xmath53% - 8% chance that the distributions are drawn from the same population , while a ks test over the sample with s@xmath14 3.96 mjy gives a much higher chance ( @xmath560% ) that the distributions are drawn from the same population suggesting that the low - powered excess is the significant difference .",
    "\\(2 ) the percentage of radio galaxies associated with the cluster as determined by spectroscopic redshifts is highly correlated to radio flux / power which is consistent with the excess source counts being the result of low - powered radio galaxies associated with a3158 ; in addition colours of these galaxies suggest they are blue which is likely to indicate starformation as a driving mechanism .",
    "\\(3 ) the alignment of the candidate starforming galaxies associated with the increased source counts follows the bridge of galaxies connecting a3158 to the a3125/a3128 complex suggestive of merger - induced formation .",
    "\\(4 ) the radio luminosity function for early - type galaxies is significantly lower than for other composite cluster environments and the field ; this result is similar to the results for the late merger in a3558 obtained by venturi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "thus , if we can use the radio galaxy population as an indicator of merger history it is likely that a3158 is observed in a late merger state with a significant excess of low - powered , blue galaxies aligned along the axis connecting this cluster to the a3125/a3128 complex .",
    "these galaxies are likely the result of merger - induced starformation .",
