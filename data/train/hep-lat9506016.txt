    "it is crucial to understand the mechanism of quark confinement in order to explain hadron physics out of qcd .",
    "our standpoint is based on the thooft idea of abelian projection of qcd.@xcite the abelian projection is to fix the gauge in such a way that the maximal torus group remains unbroken . after the abelian projection , monopoles appear as a topological quantity in the residual abelian channel .",
    "qcd is reduced to an abelian theory with electric charges and monopoles .",
    "if the monopoles make bose condensation , charged quarks and gluons are confined due to the dual meissner effect .",
    "based on this standpoint , the present author and his collaborators have studied color confinement mechanism and hadron physics performing monte carlo simulations of abelian projection in lattice qcd . @xcite the aim of the study is to ascetain correctness of the picture , that is , to check if monopole condensation really occurs in qcd . here",
    "i review the results of these studies compactly .",
    "there are infinite ways of abelian projection extracting such an abelian theory out of qcd .",
    "we have found two gauges which show interesting behaviors called abelian dominance .",
    "@xcite    one is the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge .",
    "define a matrix in @xmath0 qcd @xmath3 \\\\       & = & x_1 ( s)\\sigma_1 + x_2 ( s)\\sigma_2 + x_3 ( s)\\sigma_3.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then a gauge satisfying @xmath4 is the ma gauge @xcite which tends to a @xmath5-covariant gauge @xmath6 in the continuum limit .",
    "the other is the polyakov gauge which is defined by diagonalizing polyakov loop operators .",
    "we have found that important features of confinement , i.e. , the string tension and the charateristic behaviors of the polyakov loops are well reproduced in terms of the abelian operators @xmath7 both in ma gauge@xcite and in the polyakov gauge . @xcite",
    "see figures   @xmath8 .",
    "fig.1  monopole dirac string + and photon contributions to + polyakov loops in ma gauge .",
    "[ f1 ]    [ f2 ]      an abelian polyakov loop @xmath9",
    "which is written in terms of abelian link fields alone is given by a product of contributions from dirac strings of monopoles and from photons.@xcite we have observed the photon and the dirac - string contributions separately .",
    "see figs.1 and 2 .",
    "the characteristic features of the polyakov loops as an order parameter of the deconfinement transition are due to the dirac string contributions alone .",
    "the photon part has a finite contribution for both phases and it changes only slightly . the fact that monopoles are responsible for the essential feature of the polyakov loop is found also in @xmath5 and in @xmath10 .",
    "it is remarkable that the behavior of the abelian polyakov loops as an order parameter and the monopole responsibility are seen _ in any gauge.@xcite _ this is the first phenomena suggesting gauge independence of the thooft conjecture .",
    "fig.3   monopole and photon + contributions to the string + tension in ma gauge in @xmath0 + qcd in comparison with the full + and the abelian ones .",
    "[ f3 ]    [ f4 ]      shiba and suzuki@xcite have shown furthermore that monopoles alone can reproduce the full value of the string tension in @xmath0 qcd .",
    "an abelian wilson loop operator is rewritten by a product of monopole and photon contributions .",
    "the string tensions evaluated from monopole and photon contributions are plotted in fig.3 .",
    "the string tension is reproduced only from the monopole contribution .",
    "it is possible to know the static potential from the correlation of the polyakov loops .",
    "the string tension is then derived from the static potential .",
    "we have measured the correlations using the polyakov loop operators written in terms of full and abelian link fields and link fields given by the monopole dirac string .",
    "the preliminary data are plotted in fig.4 in the case of the polyakov gauge .",
    "a linear behavior is seen with the almost similar string tension in all three cases .",
    "this is another data supporting gauge invariance of confinement mechanism due to monopole condensation .",
    "the above abelian dominance suggests that a set of @xmath5 invariant operators @xmath11 are enough to describe confinement .",
    "then there must exists an effective @xmath5 action @xmath12 describing confinement .",
    "we tried to derive @xmath12 using schwinger - dyson equations , but failed to get it in a compact and local form.@xcite @xmath12 contains larger and larger loops as @xmath1 .",
    "shiba and suzuki author tried to perform a dual transformation of @xmath12 in @xmath0 qcd and to obtain the effective @xmath5 action @xcite in terms of monopole currents.@xcite to study the long range behavior important in qcd , they have considered also extended monopoles.@xcite the extended monopole currents are defined by the number of the dirac strings surrounding an extended cube : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ordinary monopole current.@xcite considering extended monopoles corresponds to performing a block spin transformation on a dual lattice@xcite and so it is suitable for exploring the long range property of qcd .",
    "the partition function of interacting monopole currents is expressed as @xmath15 ) .",
    "\\label{eqn : pfunm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is natural to assume @xmath16 = \\sum_i f_i s_i [ k]$ ] . here",
    "@xmath17 is a coupling constant of an interaction @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "for example , @xmath19 is the coupling of the self energy term @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the coupling of a nearest - neighbor interaction term @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the coupling of another nearest - neighbor term @xmath24.@xcite shiba and suzuki@xcite extended a method developed by swendsen@xcite to the system of monopole currents obeying the current conservation rule .",
    "the monopole actions are obtained locally enough for all extended monopoles considered even in the scaling region .",
    "they are lattice volume independent .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath19 of the self - energy term is dominant and the coupling constants decrease rapidly as the distance between the two monopole currents increases .    to study monopole dynamics ,",
    "we have also studied the length of monopole loops and monopole charge distribution .",
    "we have found that 1)each vacuum has only one long connected loop and a small number of short loops .",
    "the difference of the two types of loops is very clear .",
    "2)the length of the long loop becomes shorter as @xmath1 becomes larger . in the deep deconfinement region",
    ", there disappears a long loop .",
    "3)monopole charges are almost @xmath25 .",
    "fig.5  monopole action versus + length of loops    [ f7 ]    [ f8 ]    since the long loop is important , we plot the value of monopole action versus length of the long loops as seen in fig.5 .",
    "the value of the action is proportional to the length @xmath26 of the long loop is well approximated by @xmath27 .",
    "as done in compact qed,@xcite the entropy of a monopole loop can be estimated as @xmath28 per unit loop length .",
    "since the action is approximated by the self energy part @xmath29 , the free energy per unit monopole loop length is approximated by @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath31 , the entropy dominates over the energy , which means condensation of monopoles . in fig.6 , @xmath19 versus @xmath1 for various extended monopoles on @xmath32 lattice is shown in comparison with the entropy value @xmath28 .",
    "each extended monopole has its own @xmath1 region where the condition @xmath31 is satisfied .",
    "when the extendedness is bigger , larger @xmath1 is included in such a region .",
    "larger extended monopoles are more important in determining the phase transition point .",
    "fig.7  coupling constants @xmath19 + and @xmath21 versus @xmath33 .    [ f9 ]    [ f10 ]",
    "the behaviors of @xmath17 are different for different extended monopoles . however ,",
    "if we plot them versus @xmath34 , we get a unique curve as in fig.7 .",
    "the coupling constants seem to depend only on @xmath33 , not on the extendedness nor @xmath1 .",
    "there is a critical @xmath35 corresponding to critical @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "now we can derive important conclusions .",
    "suppose the effective monopole action remains the same for any extended monopoles in the infinite volume limit .",
    "then the finiteness of @xmath37 suggests @xmath36 becomes infinite when the extendedness @xmath38 goes to infinity .",
    "@xmath0 lattice qcd is always ( for all @xmath1 ) in the monopole condensed and then in the color confinement phase.@xcite this is one of what one wants to prove in the framework of lattice qcd .",
    "notice again that considering extended monopoles corresponds to performing a block spin transformation on the dual lattice .",
    "the above fact that the effective actions for all extended monopoles considered are the same for fixed @xmath33 means that the action may be the renormalized trajectory on which one can take the continuum limit .",
    "see fig.8 .",
    "our results suggest the continuum monopole action takes the form predicted by smit and sijs.@xcite",
    "to test if the fixed monopole action is the renormalized trajectory , we have tried to simulate the system with the action.@xcite    we have obtained the following results :    1 .",
    "the action with quadratic interactions alone is not good , since it gives a longer monopole loop and a larger string tension than expected .",
    "we need a term which gives a repulsive force between monopole currents",
    ". 2 .   with such small repulsive terms , we get the nice fit of the loop length and the string tension on small lattices .",
    "finite - size effects are seen to be small .",
    "we have also made monte - carlo simulations in the @xmath39 qcd .",
    "only the self - coupling term can reproduce the qualitative features of the deconfinement transition as seen in fig.10 .",
    "fig.9  the string tension versus + the lattice size    [ f11 ]    [ f13 ]",
    "some comments are in order .    1 .",
    "it is important to find an order parameter of confinement due to monopole condensation.@xcite the number of dirac string @xmath40 may be a candidate.@xcite @xmath40 is a magnetic @xmath5 variant quantity.@xcite 2 .",
    "gauge independence should be proved if the monopole condensation is the real confinement mechanism .",
    "the data of polyakov loops from monopoles are encouraging . that the correct string tension could be derived both in ma gauge and polyakov gauge is also encouraging .",
    "gauge independent results will be obtained if we go to large @xmath1 on larger lattice .",
    "3 .   how to test the correctness of this idea ? the theory predicts the existence of an axial vector glueball - like state c(@xmath41 ) and a scalar glueball - like state @xmath42(@xmath43 ) .",
    "the masses seem to satisfy @xmath44.@xcite the masses could not be too heavy .",
    "they have to exist under 2gev . to evaluate the correlation between the state and the light hadrons in mc simulations of full qcd is very important to derive the total width and the branching ratios .",
