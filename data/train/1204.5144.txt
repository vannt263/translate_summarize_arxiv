    "a central challenge for the realization of practically useful quantum computation is to find systems where the implementation of qubits and gate operations is resilient to perturbations due to instabilities in the setup and to open system effects .",
    "several approaches to realize this resilience of quantum gates have been proposed , including the use of decoherence - free subspaces @xcite , noisless subsystems @xcite , and topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "one of these approaches is holonomic quantum computation ( hqc ) , using adiabatic evolution @xcite .",

    "the gates in refs . @xcite have turned out to be difficult to realize experimentally .",
    "one reason for this is the long run - time required for the desired parametric control associated with adiabatic evolution .",
    "the run - time must be long enough to minimize non - adiabatic corrections , but sufficiently short so that the error rate due to open system effects and instabilities of the setup is small .",
    "a scheme for hqc based on non - adiabatic non - abelian geometric phases has been proposed in ref .",
    "this scheme allows for universal quantum computation using gates that can be implemented rapidly compared to the adiabatic schemes , and therefore avoids the problems associated with a long run - time .",
    "non - adiabatic hqc has been combined with decoherence free subspaces @xcite and applied to coupled quantum dots as well as molecular magnets @xcite . in this paper , we study some aspects of the robustness of one - qubit gates of the proposed non - adiabatic scheme to different kinds of errors and compare it to the robustness of the corresponding adiabatic gates based on the duan _",
    "scheme .    to realize quantum computation , it is necessary to bring the error rate per gate operation down below some threshold where error correction can be used to make the computation reliable .",
    "this threshold error rate has been estimated in different settings and by different authors to be somewhere between @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "there are many different sources of imperfections and their relative importance is specific to which system is used for the implementation of the gate .",
    "we therefore limit our study to some general sources of error that are typically encountered in a variety of implementations .",

    "we have chosen @xmath176 in the case of fixed coupling strength , while in the case of fixed run - time , we take @xmath177 for the @xmath70 phase - shift gate and @xmath178 for the hadamard gate . furthermore , @xmath179 , which guarantees that there is no pulse overlap for the @xmath180 range shown in the figure .    with constant relative detuning",
    ", the fidelities of the non - adiabatic gates tend to unity in the large @xmath180 limit ( left panels ) .",
    "the behavior is similar to the case with nonzero mean detuning .",
    "the adiabatic gates , on the other hand , are unstable to relative detuning and do not converge to any value of the fidelity when run - time @xmath46 is increased while the coupling strength is fixed .",
    "instead , the mean fidelity as a function of @xmath46 is an oscillating function . if the run - time is fixed and @xmath99 is increased the fidelities stabilize at some value that is a function of the parameter @xmath181 and typically not unity .",
    "the non - adiabatic gates can thus be made resilient to relative detuning by using short enough pulses .",
    "one way to have high fidelity in the adiabatic case , is to choose @xmath46 corresponding to a maximum in the oscillating mean fidelity .",
    "this however requires precise knowledge of the relative detuning . without such knowledge",
    "it must be possible to choose @xmath182 sufficiently large so that the first decline in fidelity due to relative detuning becomes significant only at run - times larger than the @xmath46 required for the adiabatic approximation to be valid .",
    "control of the pulse envelope and the relative amplitudes and phases of the two driving fields is of crucial importance to gate operation . to study the effect of errors in the driving fields , we make the assumption that the deviations from the ideal case are such that the relative strength and relative phase of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 transitions are time independent during the implementation of a pulse - pair . given this assumption the hamiltonian can be written @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the non - ideal pulse envelope and @xmath185 are the non - ideal relative strength and phase of the transitions satisfying @xmath186 .",
    "since the implementation of the non - adiabatic gates depends only on the area of the two pulses in each pulse pair and not on the exact shape , gate operation is robust to area preserving deviations in the shape .",
    "only the deviation of @xmath187 from @xmath76 is relevant .    if we introduce the notation @xmath188 for the ideal hamiltonian we can express the error due to the deviations in terms of the fidelity as @xmath189 where @xmath190 is an arbitrary normalized input qubit state . using that @xmath191 and @xmath192 for @xmath193",
    ", we can see that @xmath194 .",
    "similarly @xmath195 and @xmath196 implies that @xmath197 . using this and the fact that the expectation value with respect to @xmath190 of any product of an odd number of @xmath198 and @xmath199 vanishes , we can express the fidelity as @xmath200 assuming that @xmath201 and @xmath202 , where @xmath203 and @xmath204 are small , we can expand the fidelity to second order in the deviations .",
    "this gives @xmath205|\\psi\\rangle^2 .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] averaging over all input states gives the average fidelity @xmath206 thus , we can see that the one - qubit non - adiabatic holonomic gate is robust to first order in the deviations in the pulse area as well as in the relative phase and strength of the transitions .",
    "the error incurred by the incorrect parameters can be understood as a failure of the subspace @xmath24 to follow the correct path .",
    "if the area of the pulses deviates from @xmath76 the state will not return to the computational subspace , and the final state will have a nonzero amplitude in the excited state . if the pulse area is @xmath76 , the state will return to the computational subspace but the gate operation will not be the desired one unless @xmath207 for some @xmath208 amounting to a @xmath209 phase shift of both @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "a special case is when there is a deviation in the pulse area but correct relative strength and phase of the couplings .",
    "the second order dependence of the fidelity on @xmath203 in this case is consistent with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite for the abelian case .",
    "although the above deviations in the parameters can lead to a gate operation that is not the desired one , the evolution is nevertheless still purely geometric during the implementation of the gate .",
    "this is in contrast to the error caused by detuning , where the reduced fidelity is due to the combined effect of modified holonomies and dynamical phases , and to the case with open system effects where the state evolves into a mixture of states that pick up different combinations of holonomies and dynamical phases .",
    "another difference is that the error introduced by incorrect parameters is independent of the run - time of the gate .",
    "the non - adiabatic gate can be made resilient to decay of the excited state and to constant mean and relative detunings by employing pulses that are sufficiently short compared to the time scales of the decay and detuning .",
    "if the idle time between preparation of the qubit and read - out can be made negligible , the gate will also be resilient to dephasing in the @xmath212 and @xmath213 bases , in the limit of short pulses .",
    "it is therefore of critical importance for the implementation of such gates that the pulse height @xmath77 can be made sufficiently large relative to the dynamical parameters describing these sources of error .",
    "there is a principal upper limit on how fast the pulses can be implemented given by the breakdown of the quasi - monochromatic approximation when the pulse changes rapidly compared to the oscillations of the driving field .",
    "if the quasi - monochromatic approximation fails there will be non - negligible frequency components of the driving field other than the desired one .",
    "these may couple to other transitions in the system and reduce fidelity of the gate .",
    "there is also a limit given by the breakdown of the rotating wave approximation when the ratio of the pulse height to either of the energy spacings @xmath146 , @xmath214 or @xmath215 , becomes too large .",
    "this causes a non negligible bloch - siegert shift @xcite of the @xmath216 transition resonance frequency due to the effect of the counter - rotating terms that can no longer be neglected .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of the sensitivity to open - system effects is only valid when the markovian approximation holds .",
    "thus , if the pulse duration is decreased to a point where it becomes comparable to the time scale of the dynamical processes underlying the open system effects , the analysis using lindblad s equation is no longer valid and memory effects of the environment must be taken into account .",
    "control over the pulse shape is important only to the extent that the pulse area must be @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , the fidelity depends on small deviations in the pulse area and the other parameters of the driving fields only to second order .",
    "the gate can not be made more robust to this source of error by decreasing run - time .    in comparison ,",
    "the adiabatic gates are robust to decay and mean detuning in the limit of large run - time .",
    "they are however not robust to dephasing and relative detuning in this limit .",
    "resilience to these sources of error in the adiabatic case requires that the field coupling strengths can be made large compared to the dephasing and relative detuning parameters , and that the run - time can be chosen sufficiently small to make the error due to relative detuning or dephasing negligible .",
    "the requirements on the operation parameters for high fidelity gate implementation in the presence of dephasing or relative detuning are thus qualitatively similar to those for the non - adiabatic gate in the sense that the coupling strength must be increased and the run - time decreased .    to fully address the issue of robustness of the non - adiabatic scheme for quantum computation one must also analyze the robustness of the two - qubit gate proposed in ref .",
    "the two - qubit gate involves coupled @xmath2 systems , that could be implemented using for example trapped ions coupled via collective spatial vibrations as in the srensen - mlmer ion trap scheme @xcite .",
    "in addition to errors emanating from imperfections in the driving fields and the interaction of the @xmath2 systems with the environment , the analysis would have to involve errors originating from the coupling mechanism as well .",
