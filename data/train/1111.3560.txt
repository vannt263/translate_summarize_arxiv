    "a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in strong perpendicular magnetic field exhibits the regime of quantum hall effect@xcite ( qhe ) .",
    "one of the peculiar phenomena specific to this regime is the appearance of one dimensional ( 1d ) _ chiral _ edge states , which are quantum analogs of skipping orbits .",
    "recent extensive experimental studies@xcite of these sates have led to the emergence of a new field in condensed matter physics dubbed the electron optics . on the theoretical side ,",
    "there are two main points of view on the physics of quantum hall ( qh ) edge states .",
    "one group of theories @xcite suggests that at integer values of the landau levels filling factor the edge excitations are free chiral _",
    "fermions_. the second group of theories is based on the concept of the edge magneto - plasmon picture.@xcite the fundamental edge excitations in these theories are the charged and neutral collective _ boson _ modes .",
    "the domain where these two approaches meet each other is the _ low - energy _",
    "effective theory.@xcite in the framework of this theory , both fermion and boson excitations are two forms of the same entity .",
    "namely , they can be equivalently rewritten in terms of each other : @xmath3\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the fermion field , and @xmath5 is the boson field . however , this transformation is highly nonlinear , and in the presence of strong coulomb interaction fermions are not stable and decay into the boson modes which are the eigenstates of the edge hamiltonian .    results of tunneling spectroscopy experiments @xcite reasonably agree with the free - electron description of edge states . however , the first experiment on aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations of a current through the electronic mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometer @xcite has shown that the phase coherence of edge states is strongly suppressed at energies , which are inversely proportional to the interferometer s size . moreover , several subsequent experiments on mz interferometers at filling factor @xmath6 have shown puzzling results on finite bias dephasing@xcite theoretically studied in @xcite .",
    "namely , the visibility of ab oscillations in these experiments is found to have a lobe - type pattern as a function of the applied voltage bias .",
    "such results are difficult to explain in terms of the fermion picture , while they all follow naturally from the plasmon physics,@xcite where the coulomb interaction plays a crucial role .",
    "thus the boson picture of edge excitations might be more appropriate .",
    "in contrast to mentioned above non - local experiments , some local measurements seem to be not able to differentiate between two physical pictures of edge states .",
    "for example , both theories predict ohmic behavior of the tunneling current , unless it is renormalized by a non - linear dispersion of plasmons .",
    "moreover , the equilibrium distribution of the bosons is equivalent to the one of fermions ( see the demonstration of this fact in section [ sec - distr - long ] ) .",
    "therefore , it might be interesting to investigate non - equilibrium local properties of edge states",
    ".    non - equilibrium behavior of 1d systems has been a subject of intensive theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies for a long time .",
    "however , only recently it has become possible to measure an electron distribution at quantum hall edge @xmath7 as a function of energy @xmath8 with high precision .",
    "@xcite the main idea of the experimental technique is to restore the function @xmath7 by measuring the differential conductance @xmath9 of tunneling between two edges through a single level in a quantum dot : @xmath10 where @xmath8 is the energy of the quantum dot level , controlled by the gate voltage @xmath11 .",
    "this technique has been used in experiments [ ] in order to investigate the energy relaxation at qh edge states at filling factor @xmath6 .",
    "the schematics of these experiments is shown in fig .",
    "the main result is that the electron distribution relaxes toward local equilibrium fermi distribution , and the energy splits equally between the two edge channels .",
    "[ nu2 ]    the first theoretical models , based on the fermion picture [ ] and on the plasmon approach [ ] , have come qualitatively to _ identical _ conclusions .",
    "namely , both works predict equal distribution of the energy between the edge channels , in agreement with the experimental findings . in other words , based on the results of refs .  [ ] and [ ] alone , the experimentalists are not able@xcite to discriminate between two alternative descriptions of the physics of qh edge .",
    "thus , it seems to be important and timely to reanalyze the problem of the energy relaxation at the qh edge in order to make new , model specific and distinct predictions that can be verified experimentally .",
    "this is exactly the purpose of the present work .",
    "here we show that the coulomb interaction strongly affects the spectrum of collective edge excitations and leads to the formation of charged and dipole plasmons modes , which propagate with different velocities.@xcite they carry away the energy of electrons injected through the qpc and equally distribute it between edge channels at distances @xmath12 from the qpc .",
    "in addition to this observation , which agrees with findings of previous works , @xcite we stress that the same process splits the wave packets of injected electrons , and leads to strong coupling of electrons to the noise of the qpc current .",
    "the regime of weak injection , i.e. , when the transparency of the qpc is small , @xmath13 , deserves a special consideration . in this regime the current noise at relevant time scales becomes markovian , and as a result , the function @xmath14 acquires a lorentzian shape .",
    "( this effect resembles a well known phenomenon of the homogeneous level broadening . )",
    "interestingly , the width of the lorentzian scales as @xmath15 at small @xmath1 , where @xmath16 is the voltage bias applied to a qpc .",
    "in contrast , the width of the eventual equilibrium fermi distribution of thermalized electrons scales as @xmath17 .",
    "if thermalization takes place at longer distances , @xmath18 , then the intermediate regime described here may be observed in experiment with a weak injection .",
    "this would indicate that interactions strongly affects the physics at the edge and that the fermion picture becomes _",
    "inappropriate_.    in order to theoretically describe the experiments [ ] and to quantitatively elaborate the physical picture , we use the _ non - equilibrium _ bosonization technique , which has been introduced in our previous work [ ] .",
    "the main idea of this approach is based on the fact that in a 1d chiral system one can find a non - equilibrium density matrix by solving equations of motion for plasmons with non - trivial boundary conditions .",
    "then , one can rewrite an average over the non - equilibrium state of an interacting system in terms of the full counting statistics ( fcs ) generators@xcite of the current at the boundary .",
    "in the situation considered in this paper , because of chirality of qh edge states , interactions do not affect the transport through the qpc alone .",
    "this leads to a great simplification , because in the markovian limit the fcs generator for free electrons is known.@xcite    the structure of the paper is following : in sec .",
    "[ sec - noneq ] we describe the non - equilibrium bosonization technique in some details .",
    "next , we use this technique in sec .",
    "[ sec - corr ] in order to find the electron correlation function for different distances from the qpc .",
    "finally , we use these results to find the electron distribution function in sec .",
    "[ sec - distr ] , and present our conclusions in sec .  [ sec - conclus ] .",
    "several important technical steps and the phenomena resulting from the non - linearity of the spectrum of plasmons are described in sec .",
    "[ ap - energy ] and appendices .",
    "we note , that the relevant energy scales in recent mesoscopic experiments with the qh edge state @xcite are very small .",
    "therefore , it is appropriate to use the low - energy effective theory @xcite of the qh edge .",
    "one of the advantages of this theory is that it allows to take into account strong coulomb interactions in a straightforward way.@xcite however , an additional complication arises from the fact that in experiments @xcite the injection into one of the two edge channels creates a strongly non - equilibrium state .",
    "we , therefore , start by recalling in this section the method of non - equilibrium bosonization , proposed earlier in ref .",
    "[ ] , which is suitable for solving the type of a problem that we face . throughout the paper",

    "edge,@xcite the collective fluctuations of the charge densities @xmath20 of the two edge channels , @xmath21 , at filling factor @xmath0 are the only relevant degrees of freedom at low energies .",
    "these charge densities may be expressed in terms of the _ chiral _ boson fields , @xmath22 , @xmath23 which satisfy the following commutation relations : @xmath24=i\\pi\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}{\\rm sgn}(x - y ) , \\label{fields}\\ ] ] the vertex operator @xmath25 annihilates an electron at point @xmath26 in the edge channel @xmath27 .",
    "the constant @xmath28 in the prefactor is the ultraviolet cutoff , which is not universal and will be omitted and replaced by other normalizations .",
    "one can easily check , with the help of the commutation relations ( [ fields ] ) , that the operators ( [ psi ] ) indeed create a local charge of the value 1 at point @xmath26 , and satisfy fermionic commutation relations .",
    "close to the fermi level the spectrum of electrons may be linearized , therefore the free - fermion part @xmath29 of the total qh edge hamiltonian @xmath30 takes the following form : @xmath31 where the bare fermi velocity @xmath32 is assumed to be the same for electrons at both edge channels . the second contribution to",
    "the edge hamiltonian describes the density - density coulomb interaction , @xmath33 which is assumed to be screened at distances @xmath34 smaller than the characteristic length scale @xmath35 in experiments [ ] , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , we may write : @xmath37 screening may occur due to the presence of either a back gate , or several top gates .",
    "we show below that the assumption ( [ short - r ] ) results in the linear spectrum of charge excitations .",
    "this approximation seems to be reasonable , agrees well with some experimental observations such as an ohmic behavior of the qpc conductance at low voltage bias , and eventually does not strongly affect our main results .",
    "nevertheless , below we relax this assumption and investigate the effects of weak and strong non - linearities in the spectrum of charge excitations .    after taking into account the relations ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ psi ] ) and applying the point splitting procedure , we arrive at the edge hamiltonian of the quadratic form in boson fields : @xmath38 which nevertheless contains free fermion contribution as well as the coulomb interaction potential : @xmath39 equations ( [ fields ] ) , ( [ psi ] ) , ( [ hamilt ] ) and ( [ kernel ] )",
    "complete the description of the qh edge at low energies .",
    "the experimentally found @xcite electron distribution function at the outmost qh edge channel is given by the expression : @xmath40 rewriting this expression via the boson fields we finally obtain    @xmath41    [ distr - phi ]    where we have introduced the electron correlation function @xmath42 , evaluated at coincident points at distance @xmath35 from the qpc . the proportionality coefficient in ( [ distr - phi-2 ] ) may be corrected later from the condition that @xmath7 takes a value @xmath43 for energies well below the fermi level ( see , however , the discussion in sec .  [ ap - energy ] for further details ) . in equilibrium , in order to evaluate the correlation function on the right hand side of this equation one may now follow a standard procedure @xcite of imposing periodic boundary conditions on the boson fields and diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) . in our case",
    ", however , the average in ( [ distr - phi ] ) has to be taken over a _",
    "non - equilibrium _ state created by a qpc .",
    "attempting to express such a state entirely in terms of bosonic degrees of freedom is a complicated and not a best way to proceed .",
    "we circumvent this difficulty by applying a non - equilibrium bosonization technique proposed in our earlier work [ ] . this technique is outlined below in some detail .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) , together with the commutation relations ( [ fields ] ) , generates equations of motion for the fields @xmath44 , which have to be complemented with boundary conditions:@xcite    [ eom ] @xmath45    the last equation follows from the charge continuity condition @xmath46 and the definition ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "thus the operator @xmath47 describes a current through the boundary @xmath48 in the channel @xmath27 .",
    "for the convenience , we place a qpc in the outer channel @xmath49 right before the boundary , so that the operator @xmath50 describes an outgoing qpc s current",
    ".    the key idea of the non - equilibrium bosonization approach is to replace the average in eq .",
    "( [ distr - phi ] ) by the average over temporal fluctuations of currents @xmath51 , the statistics of which is assumed to be known . indeed ,",
    "although in general the fields @xmath44 influence fluctuations of the currents @xmath51 , leading to such effects as the dynamical coulomb blockade @xcite and cascade corrections to noise , @xcite in the case of chiral fields describing qh edge states no back - action effects arise .",
    "@xcite as a consequence , at integer filling factors the electron transport through a single qpc is not affected by interactions , which seem to be an experimental fact .",
    "@xcite therefore , by solving equations ( [ eom ] ) one may express the correlation functions of the fields @xmath44 in terms of the generator of full counting statistics ( fcs):@xcite @xmath52 here averaging is taken over _ free _ electrons , and the operators @xmath53 may be viewed as a total charge in the channel @xmath27 to the right of the boundary at @xmath48 .",
    "to prove the connection of the electron correlations in ( [ distr - phi ] ) to the generating functions ( [ fcs ] ) , we come back to the discussion of the interaction effects , which are in fact encoded in a solution of the equations of motion ( [ eoma ] ) . the long - range character of the coulomb interaction leads to the logarithmic dispersion in the spectrum of collective charge excitations , the physical consequences of which are discussed in secs.[sec - distr ] and [ ap - energy ] . for a moment , to simplify equations ( [ eoma ] ) , we have assumed screening of the coulomb potential at distances @xmath34 shorter than the characteristic length scale @xmath54 , which is of the order of few microns in recent experiments .",
    "nevertheless , it is very natural to assume that the screening length @xmath34 is much larger than the distance @xmath28 between edge channels , @xmath55 , which does not exceed few hundreds nanometers .",
    "therefore , one can write @xmath56 i.e. , the in - channel interaction strength is approximately equal to the intra - channel . as a result ,",
    "the spectrum of collective charge excitations splits into two modes : a fast charged mode @xmath57 with the speed @xmath58 , and a slow dipole mode @xmath59 with the speed @xmath60 .",
    "it is important to stress that the condition @xmath61 , leading to ( [ approx ] ) , results in a sort of universality : the solution of equations of motion ( [ eoma ] ) in terms of the charged and dipole mode ,    [ transform - phi ] @xmath62\\\\ \\phi_2(x , t ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\tilde{\\phi}_1(x - ut)-\\tilde{\\phi}_2(x - vt)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    is only weakly sensitive to perturbations of our model , in particular to those that account for different bare fermi velocities of edge channels and slightly different interaction strengths .",
    "applying now boundary conditions ( [ eomb ] ) to the result ( [ transform - phi ] ) , we finally solve equations of motion in terms of the boundary currents :    [ sol - full ] @xmath63\\\\ -\\pi\\!\\int_{-\\infty}^{t_v}\\!\\!\\!dt'[j_{1}(t')-j_{2}(t')],\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath64\\\\ + \\pi\\!\\int_{-\\infty}^{t_v}\\!\\!\\!dt'[j_{1}(t')-j_{2}(t')],\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where we have introduced notations @xmath65 finally , using the definition ( [ q ] ) , we arrive at the solution in the compact form @xmath66 , \\label{sol - fast}\\ ] ] and to a similar expression for the inner channel .",
    "the physical meaning of this result is rather simple : when charges are injected into the channel @xmath49 and @xmath67 , they excite charged and dipole mode ( note the minus sign in the fourth term on the right hand side ) which have different propagation speeds @xmath58 and @xmath68 . as a result ,",
    "these charges arrive at the observation point @xmath26 with different time delays @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and make a contribution to the field @xmath71 at different times ( [ notations ] ) .",
    "[ fig - plasmon ]    when substituting this result into the correlation function in eq .",

    "[ fig - plasmon ] .",
    "this assumption is quite intuitive and may be easily checked using gaussian approximation .",
    "we , finally , arrive at the following important result : @xmath78 i.e. , the electronic correlation function ( [ corr - long ] ) may indeed be expressed in terms of the fcs generator ( [ fcs ] ) .",
    "the expression ( [ corr - short ] ) presents formally a full solution of the problem of evaluation of an electron correlation function .",
    "generators of the fcs for free electrons in this expression , defined as ( [ fcs ] ) , may be represented as a determinant of a single particle operator,@xcite and eventually , evaluated , e.g. , numerically .",
    "however , a further analytical progress is possible in a number of situations , which are important for understanding physics of the energy relaxation processes . in particular",
    ", we show in this section that for the case of equilibrium fluctuations of the boundary currents , the correlation function ( [ corr - short ] ) as well as the electron distribution function ( [ distr - phi ] ) acquire an equilibrium free - fermionic form .",
    "the electron correlation function may also be found analytically away from equilibrium for the case of a gaussian noise .",
    "interestingly , in the short - time limit , @xmath79 , the main contribution to the correlation function comes from zero - point fluctuations of boundary currents , and it behaves as a free - fermion correlator , i.e. , it scales as @xmath80 . in the long - time limit ,",
    "@xmath81 , the non - equilibrium zero - frequency noise dominates , and the electron correlation function decays exponentially with time .",
    "this is exactly the limit where a non - gaussian markovian noise should also be taken into account .      in the context of the noise detection physics @xcite the dimensionless counting variable @xmath82 in the expression ( [ corr - short ] ) for the fcs generator",
    "plays the role of a coupling constant . typically , it is small , @xmath83 , so that the contributions of high - order cumulants of current noise to the detector signal are negligible . @xcite",
    "in contrast , in the physical situation that we consider in the present paper @xmath84 , implying that the shape of the distribution function may be strongly affected by high - order current cumulants . nevertheless , it is instructive to first consider gaussian fluctuations , simply truncating the cumulant expansion at second order in @xmath82 . in this case",
    "the correlation function ( [ corr - long ] ) may be evaluated exactly . the are many reasons for starting the analysis from considering an example of a gaussian noise : first of all , in equilibrium the current fluctuations in a chiral 1d system are always gaussian .",
    "second , as we show in the appendix [ ap - supr ] , the dispersion of the charged and dipole modes leads to a suppression of higher order cumulants at large distances @xmath35 .",

    "thus it seems to be reasonable to assume that the equilibration length @xmath134 may indeed be quite long .",
    "therefore , in order to explore the physics of collective charge excitations at intermediate distances we propose to consider a regime of weak injection at the qpc : @xmath13 .",
    "firstly , we note that in this case our results ( [ cf - gauss ] ) and ( [ cf - nongauss ] ) may indeed be used to evaluate the electron distribution function , because the main contribution to the integral ( [ distr - phi-1 ] ) arises from markovian time scales .",
    "secondly , and more importantly , in this regime the electron distribution function acquires a strongly non - equilibrium form and the width of the order of @xmath15 , which plays a role of the new energy scale .",
    "moreover , the advantage of the weak injection regime is that it allows to investigate a non - trivial evolution of the distribution function , which arises due to bosonic , collective character of excitations and goes via several well distinguishable steps .      at distances of the order of the energy exchange length scale @xmath135 the initial double step distribution function",
    "is strongly perturbed by the interaction between channels . as we argued in sec .",
    "[ nb ] , at distances @xmath136 the charged and dipole modes split and make independent contributions to the electron correlation function .",

    "in fact , the result ( [ distr - nongauss ] ) fails at large energies in somewhat non - trivial way .",
    "namely , it is easy to see that any electron distribution function has to satisfy the sum rule @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the cutoff well below the fermi level , and the `` average '' bias @xmath128 in the case of linear dispersion of plasmons .",
    "this sum rule simply expresses the requirement of the conservation of the charge current and implies certain amount of asymmetry in the distribution function . in the present case , such an asymmetry arises in the power - law tails of the function @xmath14 and originates from quantum non - equilibrium noise .",

    "moreover , at energies of the order of @xmath16 the power - law behavior of the function ( [ distr - nongauss ] ) has to have a cut - off , because the qpc does not provide energy much larger than the voltage bias .",

    "nevertheless , even in the case of a weak non - linearity in the spectrum of the the both modes of the sort@xcite @xmath151 barely seen in the conductance of a qpc , an intermediate length scale @xmath152 may arise at which high - order cumulants of current are suppressed , and the noise becomes effectively gaussian .",
    "this situation occurs when the wave packets of the original width @xmath153 overlap .",
    "a simple estimate using the nonlinear correction ( [ spectrum ] ) gives the length scale @xmath154 we support this conclusion by rigorous calculations in appendix [ ap - supr ] .",

    "this implies that @xmath156 , and leads to the possibility to observe non - gaussian effects at distances @xmath157 , discussed in the previous section .",
    "obviously , the same requirement also guarantees that dispersion corrections to the ohmic conductance of a qpc are small .",
    "this allows us to neglect corrections to the quantum part of the electron correlation function and to use the result ( [ cf - gauss ] ) for a gaussian noise . substituting this result to the equation ( [ distr - phi-1 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath158 in the case @xmath159 .",
    "one can see , that the width of the function ( [ distr - gauss ] ) is almost twice as large compared to the one the function ( [ distr - nongauss ] ) .",
    "moreover , the function ( [ distr - gauss ] ) satisfies the sum rule ( [ sum - rule1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we do not expect any asymmetry in the high - energy tails of this function , in contrast to the situation with the non - gaussian noise .",
    "the comparison of distribution functions in these two regimes is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig - distrib ]",
    "so far we have considered a situation where both charged and dipole mode are dispersive . if for some reason the dispersion of one of the modes is negligible , then higher order cumulants are suppressed only by a factor of two .",
    "the derivative of the electron distribution function in this situation is given by the lorentzian @xmath160 centered at @xmath161 with the width @xmath162 .",
    "this is because one mode brings only gaussian component of the markovian noise , while the other one brings full non - gaussian noise .",
    "next , we consider the distribution function at long distances , @xmath163 , after the equilibration takes place .",
    "the temperature of the eventual equilibrium distribution may be found from the conservation of energy . in the next section",
    "we show that the heat flux produced at qpc splits equally between two edge states .",
    "in the situation of linear dispersion the distribution function acquires the form @xmath164 the possibility of such equilibration process is suggested by the fact that the equilibrium distribution of bosons implies the equilibrium distribution for electrons , as has been shown in sec .",

    "we conclude that the width of the equilibrium distribution scales as @xmath2 , in contrast to the case of a non - equilibrium distribution at shorter distances from the current source , where it scales linear in @xmath1 .",

    "we have seen that in the case of weakly dispersive plasmons , @xmath166 , the non - linearity in the spectrum leads to the suppression of high - order cumulants of current noise at relatively long distances , which strongly affects the distribution function . on the other hand ,",
    "the direct contribution of the non - linear correction in the spectrum to local physical quantities , such as the qpc conductance and the heat flux , is small and has been so far neglected .",

    "an important remark is in order .",
    "the integral ( [ quantum - f ] ) may diverge at large @xmath188 and has to be cut off at the upper limit .",
    "this is because there is no guarantee of the free - fermionic behavior of the correlator @xmath189 at short times and of the zero - temperature electron distribution function @xmath187 at large energies .",
    "thus , the integral ( [ flux - def ] ) has to be also cut off , which is what in fact is done in experiment .",

    "<S> in this work we address the recent experiments of altimiras and collaborators , @xcite where an electron distribution function at the quantum hall ( qh ) edge at filling factor @xmath0 has been measured with high precision . </S>",
    "<S> it has been reported that the energy of electrons injected into one of the two chiral edge channels with the help of a quantum point contact ( qpc ) is equally distributed between them , in agreement with earlier predictions , one being based on the fermi gas approach , @xcite and the other utilizing the luttinger liquid theory . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we argue that the physics of the energy relaxation process at the qh edge may in fact be more rich , providing the possibility for discriminating between two physical pictures in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> namely , using the recently proposed non - equilibrium bosonization technique @xcite we evaluate the electron distribution function and find that the initial `` double - step '' distribution created at a qpc evolves through several intermediate asymptotics , before reaching eventual equilibrium state . at short distances the distribution function is found to be asymmetric due to non - gaussian current noise effects . at larger distances , where noise becomes gaussian </S>",
    "<S> , the distribution function acquires symmetric lorentzian shape . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , in the regime of low qpc transparencies @xmath1 the width of the lorentzian scales linearly with @xmath1 , in contrast to the case of equilibrium fermi distribution , whose width scales as @xmath2 . therefore , we propose to do measurements at low qpc transparencies . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the missing energy paradox @xcite may be explained by the non - linearities in the spectrum of edge states . </S>"
