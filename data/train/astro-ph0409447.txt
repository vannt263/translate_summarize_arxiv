    "white dwarfs ( wds ) are the final state of stellar evolution for the vast majority of intermediate- and low - mass stars .",
    "the upper mass limit of wd progenitor stars , @xmath3 , is also the lower mass limit of core - collapse supernova progenitors .",
    "the current best observational estimate for @xmath3comes from spectroscopic analysis of wds in the open cluster @xcite and is @xmath4 . due to the steepness of the initial - mass function ( imf ) ,",
    "however , this range results in a factor of @xmath5 uncertainty in the number of supernovae and duration of supernova - driven winds resulting from bursts of star formation .",
    "this uncertainty in turn has a large impact on understanding the star - formation rate in galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the evolution of starbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the fate of low - mass dwarf galaxies at early times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the best observational constraints on @xmath3are obtained from studies of wd populations in open clusters with ages @xmath6 myr @xcite .",
    "( m35 ) is one of the richest , compact and nearby open clusters in this age range , with age determinations ranging from @xmath7 myr @xcite to @xmath8 myr @xcite .",
    "the wd cooling sequence of ngc 2168 has been discussed often in the literature , with recent photometric analyses by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "with spectroscopy of cluster wd candidates , it is possible to determine unambiguously if the objects are wds and , for the bona fide wds , to determine @xmath9and @xmath10 , and to derive the cooling age ( @xmath11 ) , mass and luminosity . for those wds with cooling ages smaller than the cluster age and distance modulus",
    "consistent with cluster membership , subtraction of the wd cooling age from the age of the open cluster results in the lifetime of the progenitor star , and stellar evolutionary models can then be used to determine the progenitor star mass . @xcite",
    "applied this algorithm to two ngc 2168 wds candidates identified on photographic plates by @xcite ; however , their signal - to - noise was too low to determine the wd properties precisely .",
    "as part of our ongoing program to identify and spectroscopically analyze the wd populations of open clusters , the lick - arizona white dwarf survey ( lawds , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have obtained high signal - to - noise spectra of eight candidate massive wds in ngc 2168 .",
    "six or seven of the observed wds are hot , high - mass wds likely to be cluster members .",
    "this sample doubles the number of known open cluster wds with high - mass progenitors .",
    "a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the entire wd population of this cluster will be presented in a later paper . in this letter",
    "we present the constraints on @xmath3and the upper end of the initial - final mass relation for wds based on the high - mass wds already analyzed .",
    "@xmath12imaging of ngc 2168 was obtained in september 2002 with the lick observatory shane 3-m reflector and the pfcam prime - focus imager ; additional @xmath12imaging of a larger field center on the cluster was obtained in january 2004 with the kpno 4 m mosaic camera .",
    "psf - fitting photometry was obtained using the daophot ii program @xcite .",
    "candidate wds were selected by their blue excess in @xmath12color space .",
    "figure  [ fig.cmd ] shows the color - magnitude diagram of all objects detected in @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 across the entire mosaic field .",
    "several very blue , faint objects are observed in the diagram ; these are our candidate wds . all four wd candidates of @xcite are recovered , as is the wd candidate in @xcite .",
    "astrometry and photometry for the wd candidates in this letter are presented in table  [ tab.phot ] .",
    "spectroscopic observations of selected wd candidates were obtained with the blue camera of the lris spectrograph on the keck i 10-m telescope @xcite .",
    "a 1-wide longslit at parallactic angle was used with the 400 l mm@xmath16 , 3400  blaze grism for a resulting spectroscopic resolution of @xmath17 .",
    "the spectra were extracted and a relative spectrophotometric calibration applied using standard _",
    "_ iraf _ _ routines .",
    "the @xmath9and @xmath10were determined for each wd using simultaneous balmer - line fitting @xcite .",
    "the model spectra are updated versions of those in @xcite .",
    "the wd evolutionary models of @xcite were used to calculate the mass ( @xmath18 ) and cooling age ( @xmath19 ) of each wd .",
    "a distance modulus to each wd was measured by comparing the observed @xmath15-magnitude to the absolute magnitude @xmath20 calculated from the best - fitting model atmosphere and the appropriate wd cooling model .",
    "errors in the fits were determined empirically by adding the noise measured for each spectrum to the best - fitting model spectrum convolved with the instrumental response .",
    "these simulated spectra were fit by the same method ; nine iterations were used to calculate the scatter in @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the fitting procedure is discussed in depth in an upcoming paper on the open clusters and @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric fits and derived wd masses and ages are given in table  [ tab.spec ] .",
    "the balmer line fits are shown in figure  [ fig.linefits ] .",
    "a systematic error in the fits of the hottest ( @xmath21 ) wds became apparent , as it was not possible to simultaneously fit all the balmer lines .",
    "in these cases , the fits were limited to h@xmath22 , h@xmath23 , and h@xmath24 . for lawds 22 ,",
    "no satisfactory convergence was achieved with these limited fits ; the best - fit models are used in the analysis .",
    "wds with @xmath25k are known to exhibit metals in the atmosphere and nlte effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , neither of which are included in the models .",
    "the progenitor mass for each wd was calculated by subtracting the wd cooling age from the cluster age .",
    "the age difference is the total lifetime of the progenitor star .",
    "the lifetimes of stars as a function of mass and metallicity are calculated from the stellar isochrones of @xcite .",
    "the progenitor mass for each wd likely to be a cluster member is given in table  [ tab.masses ] for an assumed cluster age of 150 myr and for three different stellar evolutionary models : @xmath26 and @xmath27 , both with modest convective overshoot , and @xmath27 without convective overshoot .",
    "upper and lower errors are for 1@xmath28 differences in @xmath19 .",
    "all eight of the observed wds are much more massive than the typical wd mass of @xmath29 @xcite , and five of the wds have apparent distance moduli @xmath30 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that at least five of these objects are members of ngc 2168 .",
    "lawds 11 is almost certainly _ not _ a cluster member .",
    "its age is likely older than that of the cluster as a whole , and while the uncertainties in the spectral fits leave open the possibility that it is younger ( which would require it to be hotter ) , the observed colors are more consistent with the cooler ( and older ) interpretation .",
    "the distance modulus of this wd is foreground to the cluster by little more than @xmath31 , but the cooler temperature favored by the  color again favors the foreground interpretation .",
    "lawds 15 has a mass and age consistent with cluster membership , but the calculated distance modulus is inconsistent with that of the other wds by @xmath32 . assuming that the distance modulus is correct and that there is no difference in reddening between lawds 15 and ngc 2168 , lawds 15 is @xmath33 pc closer than the cluster .",
    "based on the spectral fits , lawds 15 has a cooling age of @xmath34 myr .",
    "if the wd has been moving away from the cluster since its formation at a steady rate of only @xmath35 km / s , it will have covered this distance .",
    "therefore , it is possible that lawds 15 was once a cluster member and has escaped the cluster .",
    "the likelihood that a massive , hot wd would be found foreground along the line of sight to the cluster can be estimated from the luminosity function in figure 16 of @xcite . the luminosity function gives the space density of wds with @xmath36 and @xmath37 myr as @xmath38 .",
    "this results in an estimated 0.1 hot , massive wds in the @xmath39 mosaic field to a distance of 1 kpc .",
    "therefore it is unlikely , but not impossible , that lawds 15 is a field wd . based on these arguments , we will consider lawds 15 to be a cluster wd for this discussion . for similar arguments ,",
    "we retain lawds 6 ( @xmath40 closer than the other cluster wds ) as a likely cluster member .",
    "figure  [ fig.ifm ] shows the initial - final mass relation of these seven cluster members , along with that of wds from hyades , praesepe and the pleiades @xcite and from ngc 2516 @xcite .",
    "also shown are theoretical and semi - empirical data from plots in @xcite and sources therein . for the sake of consistency ,",
    "the initial and final masses of each wd from the literature have been re - determined using our wd models and the published @xmath9and @xmath10 .    from the figure",
    ", it can be seen that the ngc 2168 wds form a monotonic sequence of more massive wds originating from more massive progenitors .",
    "this conclusion is robust , as changes in the assumed age of ngc 2168 do not affect the relative positions of the points , only the absolute initial masses .",
    "figure  [ fig.ifm ] also shows that the ngc 2168 initial - final mass relation agrees with the empirical relation derived from previous clusters .",
    "this need not be expected _ a priori _ , as ngc 2168 has a significantly lower metallicity than the other clusters in the diagram .",
    "model core masses decrease with increasing metallicity , and the efficiency of mass loss processes could change with metallicity .",
    "lawds 15 and lawds 6 , the potential escaped cluster wds discussed above , fit the observed initial - final mass relation , providing additional evidence that they are cluster members .",
    "if these wds are indeed escaped cluster members , they are crucial pieces of evidence that wds can receive velocity kicks during mass loss and perhaps explain the observed deficit of wds in other open clusters ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this and other potential explanations for these objects ( e.g. binarity ) will be discussed more fully in the later paper on wds in ngc 2168 .",
    "the wd in fig .",
    "[ fig.ifm ] with the apparently low final mass is lawds 22 . as mentioned above and visible in fig .",
    "[ fig.linefits ] , the spectral fitting did not converge satisfactorily , despite the high signal - to - noise of the spectrum .",
    "this star is a close visual double with a redder companion ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) 2to the north . while resolved , this double is close enough that the spectrum of lawds 22 is likely contaminated by light from the neighbor star , resulting in the unsatisfactory fit .",
    "light from the neighboring star may also be contaminating the photometric colors of lawds 22 , which would also explain why the star lies redward of the 1@xmath0cooling track in fig .",
    "[ fig.cmd ] . given",
    "its measured @xmath9 , lawds 22 likely suffers from an extension of the systematic issue in the high-@xmath9wd spectral fits described above .",
    "other explanations for the location of this point could include magnetic fields ( although no splitting is observed ) or a low - mass , unresolved companion , but contamination by the neighboring star seems to be the most likely cause .",
    "based on the ngc 2168 data alone , it is possible to place lower limits on the value of @xmath3 . making the assumption that errors in the wd ages in table  [ tab.spec ] are gaussian",
    ", we calculate that the oldest cluster wd ages are @xmath44 with 90% confidence . for @xmath45 and @xmath26 ,",
    "this corresponds to @xmath46 at a 90% confidence level .",
    "this value is in agreement with that obtained by @xcite .",
    "improved constraints on the initial - final mass relation , including its intrinsic scatter and metallicity dependence , require improvements on existing observations .",
    "first and foremost , the ages of open clusters such as ngc 2168 must be determined to higher precision .",
    "alternatives to main - sequence fitting such as lithium depletion studies or activity / rotation studies may provide the necessary constraints .",
    "second , large samples of wds from individual open clusters are needed to reduce the effect of systematics ( such as errors in assumed ages ) that plague the comparison of inter - cluster samples . the wd sample presented here is a start to that end , and the initial - final mass relation derived from these stars alone provides dramatic confirmation of the existence of an initial - final mass relation , an idea that was strongly hinted at from previous open cluster studies and from other theoretical and observational work . assuming that the majority of the remaining massive ngc 2168 wd candidates are cluster wds , planned spectroscopic observations of these objects will soon result in a sample of nearly a dozen of wds originating from a single stellar population , permitting , for the first time , studies of the intrinsic dispersion of the initial - final mass relation at high masses .",
