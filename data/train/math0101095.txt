    "consider the class of _ beltrami fields _  the volume - preserving eigenfields of the curl operator .",
    "such vector fields are the source of numerous interesting phenomena in inviscid fluids and plasmas .",
    "for example , beltrami fields are the only steady three - dimensional euler flows which admit chaotic lagrangian dynamics .",
    "beltrami fields are also common approximations to the magnetic field lines in large - scale structures within the solar corona .    despite their importance and inherent intricacy ,",
    "very little is known about the dynamics of beltrami fields apart from numerical simulation @xcite and melnikov analyses of near - integrable beltrami fields @xcite  an important but extremely small class of solutions .",
    "we consider the subtle problem of understanding how much and what kinds of dynamics beltrami fields are forced to possess given the underlying topological features of the fluid domain .    in a series of papers @xcite , the authors develop techniques for determining forced behaviors in steady inviscid fluids via the topology of _ contact structures _ , the odd - dimensional analogues of symplectic structures ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite for an introduction to contact geometry ) . in this paper",
    ", we give an application of these techniques to beltrami fields on solid tori .",
    "one of the features of our topological approach is that it is independent of the riemannian metric and is furthermore robust with respect to perturbations of the vector field , without resorting to any hyperbolicity or nondegeneracy assumptions usually required to preserve closed orbits .",
    "we restrict attention to beltrami fields on riemannian solid tori , such as would occur in the case of a force - free plasma in a containment device . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown using techniques from contact topology and pseudo - holomorphic curves that steady euler fields on an invariant solid torus _",
    "always _ possess a closed orbit , independent of the riemannian structure and volume form :    * theorem : * ( @xcite ) _ any steady real - analytic solution to the euler equations ( [ eq_euler ] ) on any invariant riemannian solid torus possesses a closed orbit .",
    "_    since every beltrami field is a steady euler field , the result holds true for all beltrami fields .",
    "the restrictive smoothness assumption is necessary for using singularity theory arguments for the integrable euler fields  in the setting of pure beltrami fields , the techniques are valid up to smoothness class @xmath1 @xcite .    in this paper , we define an integer - valued index for detecting the presence of _ contractible _ closed orbits  those closed orbits which can be shrunk to a point within the solid torus .",
    "thus , we are not primarily concerned with the class of beltrami fields which possess a cross - section ( and hence trivially have a closed non - contractible orbit by the brouwer fixed point theorem ) . in cases where no section exists , it is very difficult to determine the existence of closed orbits .",
    "indeed , the recent examples of fixed - point - free vector fields on a solid torus without any periodic orbits ( constructible via @xcite in the real - analytic case , and by @xcite in the @xmath0 volume - preserving case ) , demonstrate the delicacy of the problem .",
    "a related scenario to which our results apply is that of a beltrami field on a long tube @xmath2 which is periodic in the third variable .",
    "the problem of finding contractible closed orbits in the solid torus obtained by quotienting out the periodicity is precisely the problem of finding an orbit which is closed in the long tube .",
    "the index we construct is a type of linking number with respect to a contact structure  the so - called _ self - linking number _ of a transverse knot , well - known to contact topologists .",
    "the data required to compute the index is minimal : one needs information about the beltrami field along some ( arbitrary ) meridional disc in the solid torus .",
    "the principal contribution of this note is to retool the contact - topological index in a form which requires no knowledge of the contact structure per se .",
    "since contact structures are very stable with respect to perturbation , the vector field need only be known approximately ( @xmath0 ) along the disc .",
    "hence , this index can be computed numerically with full rigor .",

    "section [ sec_ot ] presents the technical result on contact structures used to define the index and prove its major properties . the section  [ sec_compute ] gives a very simple method for computing this index from a minimal amount of data : one need simply know what the vector field @xmath3 approximately looks like near some finite number of points on a meridional disc of the solid torus .",
    "it is our hope that this computability may allow for utilization of this index in the analysis of experimental data .",

    "the lie derivative @xmath22 of the volume form along @xmath19 vanishing is equivalent to @xmath19 being divergence - free",
    "beltrami fields also yield steady solutions to the ideal mhd equations @xmath23 + @xmath24 + @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the magnetic field . in this context",
    ", beltrami fields are known as force - free fields .",
    "3 .   beltrami fields are all extrema of the @xmath27 energy functional @xmath28 under the action of the volume - preserving diffeomorphism group of @xmath4 .",
    "eigenfields of curl having the smallest nonzero eigenvalue globally minimize the energy @xcite .",
    "beltrami fields also play a role in the analysis of the stability of matter @xcite and in the formation of dynamos @xcite .",
    "the topology and dynamics of beltrami fields are subtle : witness the complex dynamics of the well - known _ abc fields _ on the euclidean 3-torus @xcite .",
    "the existence of fixed - point - free beltrami fields on general riemannian 3-manifolds is highly nontrivial @xcite , as is the presence of closed orbits within such fields @xcite .",
    "contact structures are the natural complements to beltrami fields .",
    "loosely put , a contact structure on a odd - dimensional manifold @xmath4 is a hyperplane field which is maximally nonintegrable . more specifically , on a three - dimensional manifold , a contact structure is a smoothly - varying plane field ( a choice of a two - dimensional subspace @xmath29 in each tangent space @xmath30 ) which can not be stitched together into leaves of a foliation , not even at a point .",
    "locally , every contact structure @xmath31 is the kernel of a differential 1-form @xmath32 satisfying the contact condition : @xmath33 otherwise said , @xmath34 is locally a volume form on @xmath4 .",
    "any 1-form satisfying ( [ eq_contact ] ) is called a contact form .",
    "if @xmath34 is a globally defined volume form on @xmath4 , then the contact structure is said to be _ cooriented _ : all contact structures which arise in connection with beltrami fields are of necessity cooriented , and we will restrict entirely to this category .",
    "a contact form @xmath32 on an oriented three - manifold @xmath4 is said to be _ positive _ if the sign of @xmath34 is positive with respect to the orientation of @xmath4 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath32 is said to be _",
    "negative_. the sign is a property of the contact structure and is independent of the defining 1-form .",
    "canonical examples of positive contact forms on @xmath35 include @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , the latter two being given in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "much of the current interest in contact structures arises from fairly recent elucidations of their topological and dynamical properties ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) . studying contact structures by means of _ characteristic foliations _ is most fruitful .",
    "given a two - dimensional surface @xmath39 embedded in @xmath4 , the characteristic foliation of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , is the [ singular ] one - dimensional foliation generated by the intersections of the tangent planes of @xmath41 with the contact planes @xmath29 in @xmath30 .",
    "for all intents and purposes , @xmath40 may be thought of as a vector field on @xmath39 generated by @xmath31 ( by orienting the foliation ) .",
    "the singularities which arise on a characteristic foliation are generically saddles or spiral sources / sinks : pure centers can not ever appear from a contact structure  the plane field twists too much for this .",
    "= 2.0 in    the dynamical properties of @xmath40 are closely related to the topological classification of contact structures .",
    "a contact structure @xmath31 is said to be _ overtwisted _ if there exists an embedded disc @xmath42 such that @xmath43 possesses a limit cycle  a closed orbit along which nearby orbits accumulate [ see figure  [ fig_ot ] ] .",
    "a contact structure is said to be _ tight _ if there are no such overtwisted discs anywhere in @xmath4 .",
    "the contact structures for @xmath36 and @xmath44 are tight @xcite , while that of @xmath45 is overtwisted ( _ e.g. _ , at the disc @xmath46 ) .",
    "it is by no means apparent that the above definition is at all helpful : but in fact , the entire topological theory hangs on this dichotomy .",
    "many major questions about contact structures are solved in the overtwisted category and unknown in the tight category ( or , if known , then only recently and then by great skill and effort ) .",
    "for example , while overtwisted contact structures have been completely classified up to isotopy @xcite , the classification of tight structures appears [ from what is presently known ] to be delicate at best , intractable at worst @xcite .",
    "the connection between contact structures and beltrami fields is , in the present context , quite straightforward . given any fixed - point - free beltrami field @xmath3 on @xmath4 , the beltrami condition states that @xmath47 > from this one can derive the crucial observation that the plane field orthogonal to any nonvanishing beltrami field is indeed a contact structure as follows .",
    "witness the 1-form @xmath48 dual to @xmath3 via @xmath5 .",
    "the kernel of this 1-form represents the orthogonal plane field @xmath31 to @xmath3 .",
    "this form @xmath32 is a contact form on @xmath4 since @xmath49 which , for @xmath50 , is nowhere vanishing , as one can easily check by evaluating on local orthogonal coordinate bases of the form @xmath51 .",
    "a little more is in fact true : a beltrami field annihilates the exterior derivative of the associated contact form , since @xmath52 such vector fields are classical objects known as _ reeb fields . _ the reeb field of a contact form @xmath32 is the unique vector field @xmath53 such that @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we have thus observed that any beltrami field @xmath3 ( nonsingular with nonzero eigenvalue ) is a reeb field for a contact form , after a possible rescaling to force @xmath56 . in @xcite , a broader version of this result",
    "was demonstrated : namely , that the class of nonsingular beltrami fields on @xmath4 ( up to scaling , for any riemannian structure and volume form ) is identical to the class of reeb fields ( up to scaling , for any contact form ) .",
    "this theorem allows one to build `` custom '' solutions to the steady euler equations of very high regularity .",
    "for example , @xcite builds a single beltrami field on a riemannian @xmath35 which possesses closed orbits of all possible knot and link types simultaneously .",
    "this can be viewed as a rigorous manifestation of the delightful results of moffatt on knotting in the euler equations @xcite .    in the present context",
    ", we will use this simple correspondence between beltrami and reeb fields to import technology from contact dynamics . most specifically , we are interested in the utility of the tight / overtwisted dichotomy in describing the dynamics of beltrami fields .",
    "one extremely important result in contact dynamics is the following theorem of hofer @xcite : _ let @xmath31 be an overtwisted contact structure on @xmath4 a compact 3-manifold without boundary .",
    "then the reeb field of any contact form associated to @xmath31 possesses a closed orbit , some multiple of which bounds a disc in @xmath4 . _    loosely speaking , a closed orbit ( limit cycle ) in the characteristic foliation of a disc in @xmath4 implies the existence of a closed reeb orbit which bounds a disc in @xmath4 .",
    "the proof relies on the delicate techniques of pseudo - holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds .",
    "one indication of the implicit nature of the proof is that the location of the overtwisted disc has little to no correlation with the location of the implicated reeb orbit .",
    "it follows from well - known properties of pseudo - holomorphic curves that the proof of hofer s theorem remains valid for a three - manifold with invariant boundary ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "thus , for the solid torus , it follows that an overtwisted reeb field must possess a contractible periodic orbit ( since the fundamental group of the solid torus contains no elements of finite order except the identity ) .",
    "> from hofer s theorem , then , one way to force a contractible orbit in a beltrami field is by finding an overtwisted disc in the orthogonal contact structure .",
    "this is far from trivial , since it requires searching for overtwisted discs among all possible embedded discs in @xmath4 : not a computationally feasible task , even if the vector field were known analytically ( which , in the context of an experimentally generated flow is not generally the case ) .    the classification of contact structures has been successfully completed only on a selected class of three - manifolds .",
    "the classification of contact structures on the solid torus is quite recent and subtle @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is known that on the solid torus there are tight contact structures which are `` stably overtwisted ''  taking some finite covering space of the solid torus and lifting the tight contact structure downstairs yields an overtwisted contact structure on the cover @xcite ( see theorem  [ thm_otcover ] ) . while this is a complication for contact topologists , it is a benefit to dynamicists .",
    "[ lem_otcover ] any beltrami field transverse to a tight contact structure , some cover of which is overtwisted , must possess a contractible closed orbit .",
    "_ proof : _ assume that @xmath31 is a tight contact structure , some finite cover @xmath58 of which is overtwisted .",
    "then , given any beltrami field @xmath3 associated to @xmath31 , lift this to a beltrami field @xmath59 on the overtwisted cover . applying hofer s theorem to the cover implies the existence of a contractible periodic orbit for @xmath60 ; however , since a covering space projection takes orbits to orbits , the closed orbit upstairs ( along with the disc that it bounds ) _ must _ project to a contractible closed orbit of the original beltrami field @xmath3 .",
    "thus , our goal is to effectively determine the existence of an overtwisted or stably ( with respect to coverings ) overtwisted structure on a solid torus given the least amount of information about a beltrami field transverse to it .",
    "to do so , we recall a common index used in contact topology ( see @xcite for an introduction ) . given a contact structure @xmath31 on a three - manifolds @xmath4 , a simple closed curve ( knot ) is called _ transverse _ if its tangents are everywhere transverse to the contact planes .",
    "assume that @xmath61 is an oriented simple closed curve in @xmath4 which bounds a compact oriented surface @xmath62 in @xmath4 .",
    "then the _ self - linking number _ of @xmath61 with respect to @xmath31 and @xmath62 is defined as follows .",
    "choose any vector field @xmath53 on a neighborhood of @xmath62 which has no fixed points and which is always tangent to @xmath31 .",
    "that this is possible is a simple argument involving the classification of plane bundles . then , flow @xmath61 for a small amount of time under @xmath53 to obtain a `` push - off '' curve @xmath63 .",
    "the self - linking number of @xmath61 , @xmath64 is then defined as the intersection number of @xmath63 with @xmath62  _ i.e. _ , the number of transverse intersections , counted algebraically using the orientations .",
    "this integer , which can be shown to be independent of the vector field @xmath53 chosen , is an invariant of transverse curves up to isotopy through transverse curves @xcite . on @xmath65 ,",
    "the self - linking number is also independent of the surface @xmath62 chosen so long as it bounds @xmath61 .",
    "the following recent result allows for an application of this index to beltrami fields .",
    "[ thm_otcover ] assume @xmath32 is a positive contact form on a solid torus @xmath66 whose reeb field is tangent to the boundary @xmath67 .",
    "choose any transverse curve @xmath61 on the boundary torus @xmath67 which bounds a meridional disc in @xmath66 .",
    "if the self - linking number @xmath64 of this meridian is not equal to @xmath68 , then the pullback of @xmath32 under some finite cover is an overtwisted contact form .",
    "it known from the inequality of @xcite that if the initial contact structure is tight , the self linking number must satisfy @xmath69 .",
    "thus , any self - linking number greater than @xmath68 automatically implies an overtwisted structure ( which is of course preserved under covers ) .",
    "the nontrivial result of this theorem is that for a tight structure , a self - linking number less than @xmath68 implies an overtwisted cover .",
    "the techniques used in the proof of this theorem are a combination of perturbing characteristic foliations , manipulating singularities of characteristic foliations , and using dynamical properties of the characteristic foliation on @xmath67 .",
    "it is necessary to distinguish between positive and negative contact structures . in the case of a negative contact form ( one for which @xmath70 ) on an invariant solid torus ,",
    "the structure possesses an overtwisted cover if and only if the self - linking number of a transverse meridian is not equal to @xmath71 .",
    "it is an easy exercise to show that the sign of the contact form dual to a curl eigenfield is precisely the sign of the eigenvalue .",
    "> from these ingredients the following index may be defined :    [ def_index ] given a nonsingular beltrami field @xmath3 on an invariant riemannian solid torus @xmath66 , define the index @xmath57 as follows .    1 .",
    "if the eigenvalue @xmath14 of @xmath3 with respect to the curl operator is zero , define @xmath72 .",
    "2 .   otherwise , consider the characteristic foliation @xmath73 of the contact structure orthogonal to @xmath3 on @xmath67 .",
    "if possible , choose @xmath61 any meridional curve on @xmath67 transverse to @xmath74 and define @xmath75 3 .   if no transverse curve @xmath61 exists , define @xmath76 .",
    "[ thm_main ] any @xmath1 or smoother nonvanishing beltrami field on an invariant riemannian solid torus @xmath66 having nonzero index @xmath57 possesses a contractible closed orbit .",
    "_ proof : _ assume that @xmath77 as the negative case follows similarly . since @xmath78 , we are either in the case where there is a transverse meridian on the boundary of @xmath66 with self - linking number not equal to @xmath68 , or there is no transverse meridian . in the case",
    "where the transverse meridian exists , some finite cover of the beltrami field has a contractible closed orbit which is preserved by the covering projection .",
    "= 4.0 in    if there does not exist a closed transversal , then a basic result in foliation theory implies that either ( 1 ) the characteristic foliation @xmath73 is entirely by meridional curves ; or ( 2 ) the characteristic foliation @xmath73 possesses a _ reeb component _ , illustrated in figure  [ fig_reebcomp ] . in the former case , the contact structure is clearly overtwisted : any meridional disc in general position which spans one of these meridional curves has this boundary curve as a limit cycle in its characteristic foliation .",
    "the existence of a periodic orbit then follows as earlier .    in the latter case , where a reeb component exists in @xmath73 , the following argument eliminates this possibility as a beltrami field .",
    "consider the reeb field @xmath53 associated to the contact form @xmath32 dual to @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath53 preserves the contact structure @xmath31 and the boundary tours @xmath67 , it must likewise preserve the characteristic foliation @xmath73 .",
    "thus , if @xmath73 contains a closed curve , then , since @xmath53 is everywhere transverse to @xmath73 , the entire boundary torus is swept out by forward images of this curve under the flow of @xmath53 , and @xmath73 is a foliation by closed curves .",
    "thus , a reeb component ( which always possesses both closed and open curves as in the illustration ) can not arise as the characteristic foliation on an invariant solid torus .",
    "given a contact structure @xmath31 on a 3-manifold @xmath4 , the determination of whether it is a tight or overtwisted structure is a difficult question in general . by the darboux theorem ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) , every contact structure in dimension three is locally equivalent to the kernel of @xmath36 , which is a tight structure @xcite .",
    "thus , on the one hand , the property of being overtwisted is a decidedly global feature .",
    "however , the process of _ lutz twisting _",
    "@xcite allows one to change a tight structure into an overtwisted structure by means of a @xmath79 alteration on an arbitrarily small open set in @xmath4 .",
    "thus , given a beltrami field @xmath3 on @xmath4 , determining whether the contact structure orthogonal to @xmath3 is overtwisted is computationally intractable .",
    "determining whether the universal cover is overtwisted is no less difficult .",
    "however , to compute the index @xmath57 , one does not need information about the vector field on the entire three - dimensional regime , but rather on some ( arbitrary ) two - dimensional meridional disc .",
    "we outline a method for easily computing @xmath57 from a @xmath0 approximation to @xmath3 along a two - dimensional slice of the solid torus .",

    "this orientation on @xmath61 induces in the usual way an orientation on the disc @xmath80 .",
    "denote by @xmath82 the projection of the vector field @xmath3 on to @xmath80 by orthogonal projection onto the tangent planes ( orthogonal with respect to the metric @xmath5 ) .",

    "proof : _ assume that the characteristic foliation @xmath43 is generic in the above sense : there are a finite number of singular points @xmath84 at which the contact structure @xmath31 is tangent to @xmath80 , and the characteristic foliation about these points appears locally as a source / sink or a saddle .",
    "following @xcite , there is a standard formula for computing the self - linking number of the transverse curve @xmath89 : @xmath90 here , the sign of @xmath91 is @xmath71 when the orientations on the contact plane @xmath31 and the orientations on the tangent plane to disc @xmath80 at @xmath84 agree .",

    "this is a corollary of the contact - topological methods used  the moral of the story is that the beltrami condition hides within it certain constraints on the dynamics which couple the dynamics of the vector field to the topology of the orthogonal plane field .",
