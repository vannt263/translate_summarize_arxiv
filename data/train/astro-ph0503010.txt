    "the presence of a massive stellar population in the early universe has been frequently invoked to account for some recent observations .",
    "most notably the large electron scattering optical depth of @xmath16 detected by the wmap satellite , corresponding to the reionization of the intergalactic medium at redshifts @xmath17 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ; kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) , is interpreted with photoionization by massive population iii ( pop iii ) stars .",
    "in addition , the amplitude and spectral break found at 1 @xmath18 m in the infrared background radiation is explained by radiation from pop iii stars at @xmath19 ( santos , bromm , & kamionkowski 2002 ; salvaterra & ferrara 2003 ) .    even before those evidences",
    ", theorists claimed that the first stars in the universe should be very massive , typically @xmath20 ( e.g. , abel , bryan , & norman 2000 , 2002 ; omukai & palla 2001 , 2003 ) . among them , bromm et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2002 ) investigated the collapse and fragmentation of primordial - gas clouds with 3-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics .",
    "they discovered that fragmentation occurs at density @xmath21 .",
    "as a result of this , dense cores with mass - scale @xmath22 are produced , which do not fragment into smaller sub - clumps after that .",
    "this fragmentation history can be interpreted from the view point of thermal evolution of primordial gas . in low - temperature ( @xmath23k ) primordial gas , the only important cooling agent is rotational / vibrational line emission by molecular hydrogen .",
    "once a sufficient amount of h@xmath24 for dynamical collapse is formed , resultant cooling causes a temperature decrease with increasing density .",
    "the collapse in this phase is so rapid that density perturbations have not enough time to grow and the clouds do not fragment .",
    "however , at @xmath21 the rotational levels of h@xmath24 reach local thermodynamic equilibrium , and the cooling becomes inefficient at higher densities .",
    "now the temperature begins to increase with increasing density .",
    "the transition from temperature decrease to increase causes the clouds to remain for long time intervals ( or to `` loiter '' ) at @xmath21 at 200k , the minimum temperature needed for excitation of h@xmath24 levels ( the first excited level locates at @xmath25k ) . at this moment , as there is sufficient time for fluctuations to grow , fragmentation occurs .",
    "the fragmentation mass - scale is set by the thermal jeans mass at this time , i.e. , @xmath22 , using the number density @xmath21 and temperature @xmath26k .",
    "those massive dense cores are expected to grow eventually to massive stars because even though protostars are initially small , rapid accretion onto the formed protostars is not halted until at least it grows to @xmath27 without dust grains ( omukai & palla 2003 ; tan & mckee 2004 ; bromm & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "along the same lines , the characteristic mass - scale ( @xmath28 ) of present - day galactic star formation may be derived ( larson 2004 ) . in the high - mass regime ( @xmath29 )",
    ", the number of field stars decreases with increasing stellar mass following the salpeter imf , while the slope of the imf flattens in the sub - solar mass regime and eventually decreases for stars below about @xmath30 .",
    "the precise origin of this mass - scale is still obscure , but larson ( 2004 ) interpreted it as corresponding to the jeans mass at the end of rapid cooling phase caused by dust thermal emission .    from the arguments above ,",
    "a close relation between the thermal evolution and fragmentation is evident .",
    "fragmentation occurs at the end of temperature - decreasing phase , or in other words , when the isothermality breaks , namely the effective ratio of specific heat @xmath31 ; the typical fragmentation mass - scale is given by the thermal jeans mass at that epoch .",
    "significance of the role played by the massive stellar population in early universe crucially depends on the duration of massive - star formation epoch and the amount of massive stars formed . as",
    "metal enrichment proceeds in interstellar medium ( ism ) , it might affect the stellar mass - scale in two different ways .",
    "first , pre - stellar thermal evolution is altered , and consequently the typical mass - scale of fragmentation changes with metallicity .",
    "second , in sufficiently high dust - to - gas ratio cases , i.e. high - metallicity environment , the accretion onto massive protostars is inhibited by radiation force onto dust grains resulting in the scarcity of massive stars . as for the former effect , even with metallicities as small as @xmath32 the thermal evolution",
    "is altered significantly , and low - mass fragments are likely to be produced ( schneider et al . 2002 ; 2003 ) . as for the latter ,",
    "a metallicity as high as @xmath33 is necessary to affect the accretion process by radiation force onto dust grains , if the dust opacity for a given metallicity remains the same as in local ism ( omukai & palla 2003 ) .",
    "since the former effect becomes important earlier in the history of metal - enrichment , the transition from massive to low - mass star formation mode is probably caused by the fragmentation process rather than by halting the accretion .",
    "based on the thermal evolution obtained by omukai ( 2000 ; paper i ) , schneider et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) discussed fragmentation properties for low - metallicity clouds and pointed out that even within the metallicity range @xmath32 low - mass fragmentation is possible .",
    "however , the thermal evolution of those low - metallicity clouds is rather complicated .",
    "the molecular cooling phase is followed by temperature increase owing to h@xmath24 formation , and finally by dust - induced temperature drop before becoming optically thick .",
    "that is , there are a few up - and - downs in temperature evolution and the epoch of isothermality break is not unique .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to determine whether fragmentation indeed occurs . in particular , after the first fragmentation in molecular - cooling phase , the cloud starts run - away collapse , during which density fluctuations might be erased by pressure force .",
    "if so , with little elongation of the core , the fragmentation at higher density would be prohibited .",
    "therefore , whether fragmentation occurs in the dust - cooling phase is still unclear .    to clarify this point , here we follow the evolution of elongation of dense cores during the run - away collapse and discuss when the final fragmentation occurs .",
    "our results confirm that fragmentation does occur in the dust - cooling phase and sub - solar mass fragments are indeed produced . in some cases ,",
    "dust - induced fragmentation occurs even in metallicity as low as @xmath34 .",
    "we have improved the previous model ( paper i ) by including deuterium chemistry .",
    "although hd cooling is important neither in the metal - free case nor in metal - rich cases , hd is found to be the dominant coolant in cases with slight ( @xmath35 ) metallicity for some density ranges .",
    "finally , we have constructed reduced chemical models that can reproduce the thermal evolution in an approximate way and might be used to include the chemical network of metals in future challenging simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 , our model for star - forming clouds is briefly described with emphasis on modification from the previous one . in  3 , the calculated thermal and chemical evolution is presented .",
    "finally in  4 , we summarize and discuss the results with some speculations on the evolution of imf . in appendix , by applying a simple model for fragmentation to the thermal evolution derived in  3 , the fragmentation mass - scales are discussed .",
    "our analysis in this paper is based on the model developed in paper i. prestellar clouds are treated by a one - zone model where involved physical variables are regarded as those at the center .",
    "thermal and chemical variables at the center , e.g. , temperature @xmath36 , concentration of chemical species @xmath37 @xmath38 of the chemical species @xmath37 is defined by @xmath39 , where n(@xmath37 ) is the number density of the species @xmath37 .",
    "] etc . , are followed as a function of the number density of hydrogen nuclei @xmath40 . while detailed radiative and chemical processes are included in this model , the dynamics of the clouds",
    "is largely simplified .",
    "the temperature evolution is followed by solving the energy equation : @xmath41 where the pressure @xmath42 and the specific thermal energy is written as @xmath43 by using the adiabatic exponent @xmath44 , the temperature @xmath45 , and mean molecular weight @xmath18 . in equation ( [ eq : energy ] )",
    ", the first term on the right hand side is the compressional heating , and the second term @xmath46 is the net cooling due to the radiative processes and chemical reactions .",
    "the net cooling rate consists of three components : @xmath47 i.e. , the cooling rate owing to line radiation @xmath48 , to continuum radiation @xmath49 , and to chemical reactions @xmath50",
    ". the last term can be negative for chemical heating rather than cooling . in our treatment , as in equation ( [ eq : defen ] )",
    ", the specific thermal energy does not include chemical binding energy .",
    "variations in chemical binding energy are regarded as cooling and heating processes and included in the net cooling rate @xmath46 . as the line radiation process",
    ", we include molecular line emission of h@xmath24 , hd , oh and h@xmath24o , and atomic fine - structure line emission of [ ci ] , [ cii ] , [ oi ] .",
    "the h@xmath24 collisional transition rates of low - lying rotational levels ( @xmath51 ) are updated by following galli & palla ( 1998 ) from paper i where hollenbach & mckee ( 1979 ) s coefficients were used .",
    "this modification lowers the h@xmath24 cooling rate below 300k and alters the behavior around @xmath52 for low - metallicity clouds .",
    "the hd parameters are from galli & palla ( 1998 ) s compilation .",
    "other parameters are the same as in paper i. continuum cooling consists of that by dust thermal emission and by h@xmath24 collision - induced emission . in optically thick cases ,",
    "cooling rate is reduced by multiplying by the escape probability of photons .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the treatment of these processes are the same as in paper i.    external radiation is not included in paper i. cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) in early universe , whose temperature is as high as several tens k , can significantly influence the thermal evolution of star - forming clouds .",
    "although there should exist additional radiation field from stars or quasars , the amount and spectrum are quite uncertain .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we consider only cmb as an external radiation source .",
    "cmb enters in our model in two ways ; first through the level population of atomic / molecular lines , and second through the heating of dust grains .",
    "these effects prevent the gas and dust temperature to fall below the radiation temperature .",
    "the former effect is included in calculating level population of atomic and molecular species as in omukai(2001 ) . the latter effect is included in determining the grain temperature by the energy balance equation of grains : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is energy transfer rate from gas to dust per unit mass , which is given by equation ( 19 ) of paper i. instead of @xmath55 the left hand side of equation ( [ eq : grtemp ] ) is the cooling rate of grains and the right hand side is heating rate by collisions with gas particles ( the first term ) and by cmb heating ( the second term ) .",
    "here we use the approximation that the planck mean opacity for absorption is the same as that for emission .",
    "this is a good approximation , being exact when @xmath56 , i.e. when cmb effect is significant .    in paper",
    "i , we have solved h , he , c , and o chemical network among 50 species and 478 reactions . in this work ,",
    "we consider the additional contributions of deuterium chemistry and hd cooling .",
    "the deuterium chemical network and the reaction rates are taken from table 1 of nakamura & umemura ( 2002 ) , which include 18 reactions among 5 species ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) .",
    "deuterium abundance is @xmath62 .",
    "for gas metallicity equal to that of the solar neighborhood @xmath63 , gas - phase elemental abundances of carbon and oxygen are @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the mass fraction of grains is @xmath66 below the water - ice evaporation temperature , and it decreases for higher temperatures as , following the grain model by pollack et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , each grain component evaporates . for lower gas metallicities ,",
    "these values are reduced proportionally .",
    "we denote the relative abundances relative to the solar neighborhood values by @xmath67 \\equiv { \\rm log}_{10}(z / z_{\\rm local})$ ] .",
    "next , we describe our prescription for the dynamics . in our model ,",
    "the only two quantities related to the dynamics are the collapse timescale and the optical depth .",
    "since we are interested in the evolution during the run - away collapse phase , we assume that the dynamics is described by the larson - penston - type self - similar solution , which reproduces the dynamics of the run - away collapse phase very well ( larson 1969 ; penston 1969 ) . given the collapse timescale @xmath68 of the self - similar solution , the evolution of the central density is followed by @xmath69 the collapse timescale of the self - similar solutions is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the ratio between the pressure gradient force and gravity at the center and @xmath72 is the collapse timescale for pressure - free collapse .",
    "we approximate the ratio of pressure to gravity @xmath71 in the central region of the self - similar solutions by the following formula : @xmath73 error in @xmath71 is less than 0.05 . at @xmath74 , @xmath71 reaches unity and @xmath68 diverges .",
    "this indicates a break - down of our assumption that hydrodynamical evolution is approximated by the self - similar solution .",
    "in reality , a hydrostatic core is formed at this point .",
    "thereafter the core contracts as its mass increases owing to accretion of the envelope . to mimic this evolution",
    ", we set an arbitrary upper limit of @xmath75 .",
    "the value of this upper limit does not affects the thermal evolution significantly unless when it is very close to unity , say @xmath76 .",
    "early in the evolution , before the clouds experience the first fragmentation , the dynamics has not yet converged to the run - away collapse . in this regime",
    ", we assumed free - fall collapse , i.e. , @xmath77 .",
    "the density distribution of the self - similar solution , which is needed to estimate the optical depth , is as follows : inside the central region , whose length scale is roughly given by thermal jeans length @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the sound speed , the density is approximately spatially constant , while in the envelope ( @xmath80 ) , it decreases outward as @xmath81 .",
    "since the column density in the envelope is at most the same as that of the central region and , in addition , the large doppler shift owing to bulk velocity reduces the optical depth of the lines , we consider only the shielding of photons by material in the central region .",
    "namely , if the cloud becomes optically thick , the optical depth is evaluated by the relation @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the opacity at the center .",
    "we neglect dark matter gravity in computing the collapse timescale .",
    "although it might be important for the low - density regime , at sufficiently high densities , where fragmentation is expected to occur , the baryons have already contracted significantly owing to energy dissipation and dominate the gravity .",
    "indeed , fragmentation is caused by the self - gravity of the baryons and the contribution of the dark matter does not alter the dynamics .",
    "we initialize the model with an arbitrary set of initial conditions for the density and temperature of the gas . in particular , we assume an initial number density of @xmath84 and , at this time , the temperature is set to be @xmath85k from bromm et al .",
    "( 2002 ) s result ( see their figure 10 c ) .",
    "indeed , the temperature evolution converges immediately to a certain trajectory , and variations in the initial conditions affect only the short transient phase of the initial evolution ( e.g. , omukai 2000 ) . for this reason , in this paper we do not consider different initial conditions and we refer the interested reader to , e.g. , palla et al .",
    "( 1983 ) and omukai ( 2000 ) for a thorough discussion of this issue .",
    "the initial ionization degree and h@xmath24 concentration are assumed to be the values for uniform matter in the post - recombination universe : @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "initially , carbon is fully ionized and helium and oxygen are neutral .",
    "in this section , we first present the thermal and chemical evolution for different initial values of the gas metallicity (  3.1 ) ; then , a reduced chemical model for low - metallicity clouds is presented (  3.2 ) . using the derived effective equation of state",
    ", we discuss the fragmentation properties of prestellar clouds and estimate the typical mass - scales of fragmentation in appendix .",
    "the temperature evolution for prestellar clouds for different metallicities is shown in figure [ fig : nt.tr3 ] .",
    "the cases with metallicities @xmath67= -\\infty$ ] ( i.e. , z=0 metal - free case ) , -5 , -3 and -1 ( @xmath67=-6 , -4 , -2 $ ] and 0 ) are indicated by solid ( dashed ) lines . as an external radiation field , only the present - day ( 2.73k ) cmb is included although its effect can be neglected except for the lowermost temperature regime in the [ z / h]=0 case .",
    "we refer to this set of models as the fiducial cases hereafter .",
    "the dotted lines indicate those of constant jeans mass .",
    "the dashed line labeled `` @xmath88 '' shows the location where the central part of a cloud becomes optically thick to continuum radiation ( eq . [ eq : univadiab ] ; see discussion later ) . before this condition",
    "is met , i.e. to the left of the line , clouds are still optically thin to continuum .",
    "the evolution of clouds with metallicity @xmath67=-(4 - 3)$ ] at @xmath89 is mostly affected by the improvements of the model , namely by the inclusion of hd cooling and the modification of the collapse timescale .",
    "conversely , both at lower and higher metallicity values , the thermal evolution is hardly altered .    in figure 2 , we illustrate separately the contribution by each processes to cooling/ heating rates in the fiducial cases . for the same cases",
    ", we also show the evolution of h@xmath24 and hd fractions in figures 3 and 4 , respectively . in terms of major coolants",
    ", the thermal evolution can be classified into the following three metallicity ranges : ( i ) quasi - primordial clouds ( @xmath67 \\la -6 $ ] ) ( ii ) metal - deficient clouds ( @xmath90 \\la -3 $ ] ) ( iii ) metal - enriched clouds ( @xmath91 $ ] ) .",
    "for each of these ranges , we now describe the evolution presented in figures 1 - 4 .",
    "1 .   quasi - primordial clouds ( @xmath67 \\la -6 $ ] ) + the presence of metals at metallicity levels as low as @xmath67 \\la -6 $ ] does not significantly alter the thermal evolution in any density range .",
    "the evolution of both temperature and chemical species follows closely those of the metal - free case .",
    "molecular hydrogen is always an important cooling agent .",
    "hd hardly affects the overall evolution despite contributing the cooling as much as h@xmath24 at @xmath92 ( see also bromm et al .",
    "+ to clarify the reasons for this trend , we first describe the hd formation process .",
    "the abundance of hd is determined by the equilibrium between the formation reaction ( d4 reaction in table 1 ) and its inverse dissociation reaction ( d6 ) , @xmath93 the deuterium ionization degree is set by the equilibrium between d1 and d2 reactions , @xmath94 the hd to h@xmath24 ratio is then @xmath95 where we have used the reaction coefficients given in table 1 . from equation ( [ eq : hdfract ] ) , we see that the hd is formed abruptly if the temperature is reduced significantly with respect to the value corresponding to the energy difference between h@xmath24 and hd ( 421k ) . specifically this occurs when the temperature falls below about 150k .",
    "+ in the case of quasi - primordial clouds , hd becomes an important coolant at @xmath96 , after h@xmath24 has already reached lte . almost at the same time hd reaches lte ,",
    "cooling becomes inefficient , and the temperature increases with increasing density . as a result of temperature increase , hd is dissociated immediately ( see figure [ fig : fhd ] ) .",
    "this is the reason why hd does not affect the thermal evolution in the lowest metallicity cases .",
    "+ h@xmath24 is formed via the h@xmath97 channel ( combination of reactions h2 and h3 ) in the low density regime @xmath98 . because of recombinations of electrons , the catalysts of this reaction , the h@xmath24 fraction saturates .",
    "this results in the plateau in h@xmath24 fraction @xmath99 in figure [ fig : fh2 ] .",
    "hydrogen becomes fully molecular only after the three - body reaction becomes important at densities higher than the threshold value @xmath100 ( palla et al . 1983 ) .",
    "the rapid increase in h@xmath24 fraction for @xmath101 is owing to the three - body reaction ( figure [ fig : fh2 ] ) .",
    "+ during the active phase of three - body h@xmath24 formation , the heating is dominated by liberation of the chemical binding energy ( figure [ fig : cool ] a , b ) .",
    "it exceeds the compressional heating by about an order of magnitude .",
    "after the hydrogen becomes almost fully molecular at @xmath102 , the h@xmath24 formation heating rate drops .",
    "however , almost simultaneously the h@xmath24 line becomes optically thick and the cooling rate for a give temperature drops .",
    "then the temperature continues to increase gradually . in the [ z / h]=-6 case , the grain thermal emission dominates a short interval around @xmath103 before dust evaporization at @xmath104 ( figure [ fig : cool ] b ) .",
    "because of increasing temperature , the h@xmath24 is about to dissociate at @xmath105 .",
    "indeed , a small fraction of h@xmath24 dissociates . at this time ,",
    "h@xmath24 collision - induced emission ( cie ) becomes important since the high density leads to frequent collisions and thus higher emissivity .",
    "cie and its inverse collision - induced absorption are emission and absorption , respectively , of photons from short - lived `` supermolecular '' species ( i.e. , @xmath106 , or @xmath107 ) formed during collisions between h@xmath24 and other particles .",
    "these supermolecules can emit and absorb photons with much higher probability than an isolated h@xmath24 molecule because of their temporarily induced electric dipoles ( e.g. , lenzuni , chernoff , & salpeter 1991 ) .",
    "collision - induced emission dominates the cooling until it becomes optically thick to the self - absorption at @xmath108 . during this interval ,",
    "the h@xmath24 that was partially dissociated is re - assembled in a fully molecular form .",
    "the alternating behavior of h@xmath24 formation cooling and dissociation heating in figure [ fig : cool ] ( a),(b ) reflects this history .",

    ". however , the temperature continues to increase only gradually owing to the effective cooling by h@xmath24 dissociation .",
    "because the temperature is already very close to the dissociation temperature , the dissociation starts just after the clouds becomes optically thick .",

    "the rapid initial temperature drop is induced by fine - structure line emission of c@xmath133 , c and o. unlike in the metal - deficient clouds , hd cooling does not affect the thermal evolution since c , o cooling are dominant . the temperature increase ( at densities @xmath134 , @xmath135 for [ z / h]=-2 and -1 , respectively ) and stagnation ( at @xmath136 for [ z / h]=0 )",
    "are due to h@xmath24 formation heating although the grain - surface reaction deposits only a few % of the binding energy ( 0.2 ev of the total 4.48 ev in the lowest density regime ) ; the rest of the energy is used for exciting h@xmath24 ro - vibrational lines or deposited on the grain and eventually radiated away in both cases ( hollenbach & mckee 1979 ) . + in the meantime , atomic carbon is converted to carbon monoxyde ( co ) .",
    "major carbon - related reactions , including co formation , are shown schematically in figure [ fig : cochem ] ( b ) .",
    "co cooling is dominant in the density range @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) for [ z / h]=-2 ( [ z / h]=-1 ) although for [ z / h]=0 it is significant only for a short time interval around @xmath139 ( figure 2 f - h ) . in some other studies , co can be the dominant coolant for a wider range of densities even for [ z / h]=0 ( e.g. , koyama & inutsuka 2000 ) .",
    "probably this is due to different assumptions on the external radiation field and on the effects of cosmic rays . at higher densities ,",
    "infrared thermal emission by dust grains becomes important .",
    "the gas temperature decreases until it reaches the dust temperature , and then thermally couples to dust grains .",
    "this occurs at densities @xmath140 for [ z / h]=-2 , @xmath141 for [ z / h]=-1 , and @xmath142 for [ z / h]=0 .",
    "after that , the thermal evolution is controlled by dust cooling and the temperature increases gradually with increasing density .",
    "when the central parts of the clouds become optically thick to dust self - absorption , the temperature begins to increase adiabatically .",
    "the evolution thereafter is the same as in the previous case .",
    "after the clouds become optically thick to continuum , the temperature increases adiabatically .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : nt.tr3 ] , all the paths in the adiabatic contraction converge approximately to the dashed line in spite of different values of temperature and density when the clouds become optically thick .",
    "the reason for this convergence has already been explained in paper i , but we repeat it here briefly for later use .",
    "first , let us consider the temperature evolution paths just before the clouds become optically thick .",
    "since cooling is dominated by continuum emission ( i.e. , the h@xmath24 collision - induced emission or the dust thermal emission depending on metallicity ) and the heating is dominated by compressional heating , the temperature is determined by the balance between them : @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the continuum opacity for gas with metallicities @xmath0 and we use the pressure - free free - fall timescale @xmath145 for this analytic estimate .",
    "note that the temperature evolution , @xmath36 , as given by equation ( [ eq : tpath ] ) , depends on metallicity through the opacity @xmath144 . while the density increases along this path",
    ", the central region , whose length scale is @xmath146 , becomes optically thick at the position in the @xmath147 plane where the condition @xmath148 is satisfied .",
    "eliminating @xmath144 from equations ( [ eq : tpath ] ) and ( [ eq : tau1 ] ) , we obtain the relation @xmath149 this is shown by the dashed line denoted as `` @xmath150 '' in figure 1 .",
    "so far , the meaning of this line has been that of the line connecting all the points where the central parts of the clouds become optically thick for different metallicities .",
    "however , this line has another significance .",
    "note that the exponent of @xmath40 ( = 2/5 ) in this relation is accidentally equal to @xmath151 for molecular hydrogen .",
    "then , this line coincides with an adiabatic path @xmath152 .",
    "since this path passes through the points where the clouds become optically thick , this is indeed the adiabatic evolutionary line in optically thick phase for any @xmath0 .",
    "this is the reason for the convergence of the adiabatic paths . in other words ,",
    "when the clouds becomes optically thick , their specific entropy has the universal value .",
    "the evolution in the optically thick phase follows just the constant entropy path with this universal adiabat , if entropy in chemical binding energy is taken into consideration .",
    "next we discuss the effect of an external radiation field on prestellar thermal evolution . in this paper",
    "we consider only the cmb in high - redshift universe .",
    "figure 7 shows the cases irradiated by the black - body radiation with @xmath153 corresponding to @xmath154 , the typical epoch for the first star formation in the universe .",
    "the cases without strong cmb ( fiducial cases shown in figure 1 ) are indicated by dotted lines for comparison .",
    "as expected , the temperature can not drop below @xmath155 . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior at higher temperatures is hardly affected by the cmb radiation .",
    "an exception to this is the case of [ z / h]=-3 around @xmath115 , where the temperature jumps up owing to heat injection by three - body h@xmath24 formation in the strong cmb case . in this case , as a result of suppression of h@xmath24 formation on grains by higher dust temperature , three - body reaction becomes more important than in the fiducial case .",
    "another difference is that the temperature in the adiabatic contraction phase does not coincide with the universal adiabat .",
    "the reason is clear from the discussion above , where we have assumed that heating is dominated by compressional heating when the clouds becomes optically thick . for higher metallicities",
    ", this condition is violated because of cmb heating of dust grains . despite the non - convergence in the adiabatic phase , after this phase these evolutionary paths converge to that of the zero - metallicity case .",
    "indeed , the evaporation of dust grains suddenly decreases the optical depth in the central parts of the clouds .",
    "after that , the clouds evolve by h@xmath24 cie cooling , exactly in the same as in the zero - metallicity case .",
    "this is partly an artifact of our one - zone treatment because in the envelope we expect dust grains to survive and to remain optically thick even though the central parts has become optically thin again . in reality , photons emitted in the central region are absorbed in the envelope that is heated and that begins to back - warm the central region .",
    "if this effect is important , our treatment breaks down . to explore this , a radiation hydrodynamic study in necessary",
    "is required .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper , and we postpone it for a future study",
    ".      metals can be either in gas phase or dust grains .",
    "these two forms of metals influence the thermal evolution in different ways .",
    "grains are of importance to ( i ) cooling by dust grains , and ( ii ) h@xmath24 formation on grain surface , while gas - phase metals act via ( iii ) cooling by atomic / molecular metal lines .",
    "to see these effects separately , we show the same cases as the fiducial ones ( figure [ fig : nt.tr3 ] ) but without gas - phase metals in figure [ fig : nt.dustonly ] , and without dust grains in figure [ fig : nt.nodust ] .",
    "other parameters are the same as in the fiducial cases , whose temperature evolution are shown by dotted lines for comparison .",
    "although we still use the same denomination [ z / h ] for easier comparison with the fiducial cases , the amount of total metals are smaller than that in the fiducial cases with the same [ z / h ] because one form of metals is missing .",
    "figure [ fig : nt.dustonly ] shows that with dust grains only , the thermal evolution for gas metallicities [ z / h ] @xmath156 is approximately reproduced . for higher gas metallicities ( [ z / h ] @xmath157 ) , the behavior in the low density regime is strongly altered because of the lack of the fine - structure - line cooling . in the metallicity range",

    "the temperature behavior is completely altered . from the comparison between figures [ fig : nt.dustonly ] and [ fig : nt.nodust ] , we can conclude that at low metallicities cooling by dust grains is dominant and the thermal evolution can be reproduced even without gas - phase metals .",
    "on the other hand , in metal - enriched cases , cooling by fine - structure lines are important in the low density regime .    considering only the dust and the fine - structure cooling",

    "although the minimum model above succeeds in roughly reproducing the thermal evolution of our full model , there are still some deviations . as a further step , here",

    "we have assumed the same dust - size distribution as the standard mrn distribution for local ism ( mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck 1977 ) .",
    "the origin of dust grains in the local ism is largely attributed to asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars with smaller contribution from type ii sne . in the early universe dust",
    "mainly comes from type ii ( todini & ferrara 2001 ) or pair - instability sne ( nozawa et al .",
    "2003 ; schneider , ferrara & salvaterra 2004 ) , since there could not be sufficient time for star to evolve to the agb phase .",
    "the average sn grain radius is smaller than for agb stars , and thus the total area per unit mass of dust is larger than the standard mrn distribution used in this work .",
    "the large grain area enhances both dust - gas thermal coupling and the h@xmath24 formation rate on grain surface .",

    "does not alter thermal evolution of low metallicity clouds significantly .",
    "we plan to study effects of different grain size distribution and gas phase elemental abundances in a forthcoming paper .",
    "recently , bromm & loeb ( 2003a , bl03 ) have also discussed the critical metallicity separating low- and high - mass star formation modes . in their analysis , they included only fine - structure - line cooling of c@xmath133 and o , and derived the critical metallicity by estimating the amount of metals above which the fine - structure - line cooling becomes more efficient than the compressional heating ( at density @xmath215 ) where the temperature drops to a minimum ( @xmath216k ) and fragmentation is expected to occur . for cases in which either [ cii ] or [ oi ] is present , they obtained critical metallicity values of @xmath217_{\\rm crit}= -3.5 $ ] and @xmath218_{\\rm crit}=-3.05 $ ] , respectively , by comparing the cooling rates at @xmath219 and 200k .",

    "after this fragmentation , the clouds start the run - away collapse , which can be described by the larson - penston - type self - similar solution , which was originally found by larson ( 1969 ) and penston ( 1969 ) for the isothermal case , @xmath225 , and was extended for other values of @xmath226 by yahil ( 1983 ) .",

    "here , we use the linear interpolation for @xmath236 and for @xmath237 we use that for the uniform - density solution . our treatment of assuming the self - similar solution breaks down when @xmath238 , where no self - similar solution exists .",
    "in reality , when @xmath227 exceeds @xmath239 at some density , a hydrostatic core forms at the center and it contracts owing to the accretion of the envelope after that .",
    "this phase is treated by the same prescription as in  2 .",
    "when the elongation grows to a certain level of non - linearity , fragmentation is expected to occur since filamentary clouds are gravitationally unstable ( e.g. larson 1985 ) . given the lack of systematic investigation of the non - linear evolution",

    "initially , just after the first fragmentation , prestellar clouds are assumed to be elongated with amplitude @xmath240 . at this point , a functional form for the probability distribution for @xmath241 is assumed . as the clouds collapse ,",

    "in contrast , for metallicities as low as [ z / h]=-6 , low - mass fragmentation is possible although the fraction in such objects is still small .",
    "the reason is that since the maximum elongation exceeds the initial value , the core can fragment provided that the initial elongation is close to the critical value @xmath244 . since highly elongated cores",

    ", only a single peak appears @xmath262 since the two temperature minima almost merge into a single one ( figure [ fig : nt.tr3 ] ) . in metal - enriched cases , because of the lower temperature , the thermal evolution is more vulnerable to external heating effects than in lower metallicity cases .",
    "external heating by stellar / active - galaxy radiation or cosmic rays is quite uncertain in primeval galaxies and it is not included in our calculation . because of this , results concerning the high - metallicity cases are to be taken with some care . with this caveat in mind , resemblance between our fragment mass distribution and the observed imf is encouraging .",
    "our simple analysis did not take into account interaction between fragments and accretion after fragmentation .",
    "however , it is known that the imf in present - day star formation is largely shaped by the fact that stars form in clusters out of gas clouds that are pervaded by supersonic turbulence , through the complex dynamics of many interacting and accreting protostars ( e.g. bate , bonnel , & bromm 2003 ) .",
    "such a clustered nature is also vital to predict the shapes of prestellar clouds themselves due to the gravitational interactions in the cluster .",
    "besides , fragmentation occurs not only in dense molecular cores , but also in massive circumstellar disks after formation of a central star ( bate et al .",
    "because of those processes not included in our analysis , fragment mass function obtained here should be regarded as showing only typical mass - scale rather than detailed mass distribution . in order to study the core mass function more quantitatively in future ,",
    "we need to consider all those cluster effects above .",
