    "a class of often investigated glass - forming liquids is the hydrogen - bonding liquids , among which the alcohols are a much studied subclass ( for a compilation of references to classical results prior to 1980 see ref .  ,",
    "section ix - c.1 ) .",
    "alcohols are normally classified into those containing one hydroxyl group ( the mono - alcohols ) and those with two or more hydroxyl groups .    during the 1950 s",
    "it was observed that the main relaxation in most mono - alcohols , contrary to the main relaxation in other liquids , can be represented by a single relaxation time  they follow the debye prediction @xcite .",
    "it was further realized that additional relaxation processes exist at frequencies above the main debye - type relaxation .",
    "one additional process is normally observed , but in some cases two processes can be resolved ( see , e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "comparisons between mechanical and dielectric measurements@xcite further showed that when the main dielectric relaxation is of debye - type its time scale is separated from the mechanical time scale , but no explanation was given for this .",
    "it was further discussed to what extent the debye - type process corresponds to the mechanical relaxation , as e.g. stated by johari and goldstein@xcite discussing the importance of mechanical measurements near the glass transition temperature : `` such a study can answer an important question : whether or not the same molecular motions are involved in the volume , shear , and dielectric relaxation of h - bonded liquids '' .    during the last decade a number of studies@xcite ( see below for details ) have indicated that the low - frequency debye - type peak is decoupled form the mechanical relaxation and that the non - debye dielectric peak at higher frequencies reflects the structural alpha relaxation . in this paper",
    "we shall term the two lowest frequency dielectric relaxations the debye - type relaxation and the alpha relaxation , respectively .",
    "this scenario offers an explanation for the earlier observations and it gives the possibility that the behavior of mono - alcohols follows that of other glass formers , except for the existence of the debye - type dielectric peak .",
    "two classes of arguments are generally given for this idea : comparisons of time scales / glass - transition temperatures and the lack of a debye - type peak in other measurement types .",
    "a large number of experiments and comparisons exists including the following : comparison with calorimetric measurements@xcite ; comparison with photon correlation spectroscopy probing the density - density correlations@xcite ; comparison with the time scale found from viscosity data @xcite ; analysis of the alpha  beta relaxation@xcite ; solvation dynamics probing mechanical relaxation of the liquid @xcite ; dielectric and calorimetric investigation of mixtures of mono - alcohols with other substances @xcite ; frequency - dependent specific heat measurements @xcite ; systematic comparison to dsc calorimetric measurements@xcite ; dielectric studies of mixtures@xcite .    except for the early ultrasonic - based measurements@xcite no direct comparison exists , to the best of our knowledge , of the macroscopic mechanical relaxation spectra and dielectric relaxation spectra of mono - alcohols .",
    "such measurements directly reveal if the non - debye relaxation mode seen in dielectrics is in accordance with the shear - mechanical structural alpha relaxation .",
    "shear - mechanical relaxation data are furthermore generally a good complement to dielectric data@xcite , and such investigations can also explore to what extent a shear - mechanical debye - type relaxation exists .    in this study",
    "we present shear - mechanical investigations in the temperature range down to the glass transition temperature together with complementary dielectric spectroscopy investigation to allow for direct comparison .",
    "the two liquids studied are 2-butanol , and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol .",
    "the reason for not studying simple normal - alcohols like ethanol , is that such systems easily crystallize .",
    "the chosen systems represent two ways of introducing steric hindrances in the system , hence improving the glass - forming ability .",
    "both liquids have been investigated earlier .",
    "for early results on 2-butanol see , e.g. , refs . and for 2-ethyl-1-hexanol see , e.g. , refs . .",
    "the measurements were performed using a custom - built setup@xcite .",
    "the temperature is controlled by a custom - built cryostat with temperature fluctuations smaller than @xmath5 ( see ref .   for details on the cryostat ) .",
    "the same cryostat was used for all measurements , thus ensuring equal temperatures and directly comparable results .",
    "the electrical signals were measured using a hp 3458a multimeter in connection with a custom - built frequency generator in the frequency range of @xmath6 ",
    "@xmath7 , and a agilent 4284a lcr - meter in the frequency range of @xmath7  @xmath8 ( see ref . for details on the electrical setup ) .",
    "the shear - mechanical relaxation data were obtained using the piezoelectric shear modulus gauge ( psg ) method@xcite .",
    "this method has a wide frequency range ( up to @xmath9@xmath10hz ) and is optimized for measuring moduli in the range of @xmath11@xmath12 , corresponding to typical moduli of liquids close to the glass transition temperature .",
    "the dielectric data were obtained using a multilayered gold - plated capacitor with a empty capacitance of @xmath13 .",
    "2-ethyl-1-hexanol ( @xmath14 , cas number 104 - 76 - 7 ) and 2-butanol ( @xmath15 , cas number 78 - 92 - 2 , racemic mixture ) was acquired from aldrich and used as received . to ensure that the samples did not change characteristics ( e.g. , due to absorption of water )",
    "dielectric measurements were performed on the newly opened bottles and repeated at the end of the studies . for both liquids",
    "the only observable changes were in the unimportant low - frequency contributions from conduction .",
    "the raw data@xcite obtained consist of frequency , @xmath16 , scans of the complex dielectric constant @xmath17 , and the complex shear modulus @xmath18 .",
    "each scan was taken at constant temperature in thermal equilibrium , stepping down in temperature .",
    "equilibrium was ensured by repeating some of the frequency scans on reheating the sample from the lowest temperature .",
    "repetition of parts of the shear mechanical measurements showed that the uncertainty on the overall absolute level of the shear modulus is rather large in the case of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol ( @xmath19 ) , it is much better for 2-butanol .",

    "the dielectric spectrum follows the general pattern for mono - alcohols with a dominant debye - type relaxation , and a minor second relaxation  the alpha relaxation .    a common way ( e.g. refs . ) to separate the minor alpha process and possible johari - goldstein beta processes from the debye - type relaxation process is to assume additivity of the processes in the dielectric susceptibility ( corresponding to statistical independent dipole - moment fluctuations of the two processes ) .",
    "this is either done by fitting a sum of a debye function and a havriliak - negami function ( and possible a cole - cole function for the beta process ) , or by subtracting the fit of a debye function from the raw data ( most common in elder studies , e.g. , ref .  ) .    in this paper",

    "from fig .",
    "[ fig : loss ] it can be seen that the mechanical beta relaxation may influence the loss peak position of the shear - mechanical alpha relaxation at high temperatures . from e.g. ref .",
    "we know that such influences only change the decoupling index between the shear mechanic and dielectric alpha relaxations slightly , such an effect can therefor not disturb the general observations .",
    "it is further noticeable that no changes can be observed in the temperature dependence of the shear - mechanical relaxation time around the temperature where the debye - type process falls out of equilibrium on the time scale of the experiment .",

    "the reason for this is that the data do not allow for direct determination of the @xmath21 for the dielectric alpha relaxation without extensively extrapolation , and that the two temperature normally not are to different due to the small decoupling between the processes.,width=321 ]    based on the loss - peak frequencies an angell plot was constructed as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : activation ] .",

    "the dielectric alpha process furthermore closely follows the tendencies of the mechanical alpha process .    the fragility index@xcite @xmath36 is reported in table [ tab : liqprop ] . a clear difference is seen between the fragility index if defined from the dielectric debye - type process or from the mechanical alpha process .",
    "the debye - type process leads to a classification of the liquid as much stronger than the mechanical alpha relaxation .",
    "the difference in temperature dependence of the debye - type process and the structural relaxation will lead to a merging of the two processes at low temperatures , if the trends continuous .",
    "this is of course close to impossible to test experimentally as the relaxation times at such low temperatures become very long .",

    "the idea is furthermore supported by the compilation of data presented in ref .",

    "the slope of the relaxation curve is found for all frequencies by pointwise differentiation , and from this a frequency range of minimum slope is determined .",
    "the reported minimum slope is an average over the slope in this frequency range . in the figure",
    "the frequency range of minimum slope is marked by closed circles , and the full line goes through a central point in this frequency range and has slope equal to the found minimum slope.,width=321 ]    this shows that the mechanical alpha - relaxation spectra , hence the mechanical relaxation processes , are similar to what is generally observed for glass - forming liquids .",
    "a small low - frequency peak was observed in the raw data obtained by the shear - mechanical transducer .",
    "closer investigations , however , showed that this was not a mechanical signal of the debye - type process , but a `` spillover effect '' of the large dielectric signal .",
    "this effect is caused by wetting of the edges of the piezoceramic discs in the transducer and the large dielectric strength of the investigated systems , it is equivalent to sometimes observed conduction contributions in the raw data .",
    "we can , of course , not entirely exclude that a mechanical signal is hiding below this dielectric spillover signal , but we are able to put limits on the maximal relaxation strength . in the case of 2-butanol",
    "the signal was partly eliminated by a correction procedure using data from a mechanical empty , but still wetted transducer . from the resulting shear - mechanical spectra",
    "one concludes that a shear - mechanical relaxation process corresponding to the debye - type process in the dielectrics must have a relaxation strength below @xmath41 ( corresponding to at most @xmath3 of the full relaxation strength ) if it exists . in the case of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol",

    "two mono - alcohols ( 2-butanol and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol ) were investigated by conventional dielectric spectroscopy and broadband shear - mechanical spectroscopy in the temperature range down to the glass transition temperature .    in the dielectric spectrum",

    "the temperature dependence of the mechanical relaxation time seems to be unaffected by the falling out of equilibrium of the dielectric debye - type process .",

    "these observations supports the existing idea@xcite that the `` minor '' non - debye peak observed by dielectric spectroscopy is the structural alpha relaxation , and that the major debye - type relaxation is _ something else_.    any explanation on the dielectric debye - type relaxation should be able to explain why no significant signature is observed in either mechanical or calorimetric studies@xcite .",
