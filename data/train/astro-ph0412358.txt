    "in an effort to study galaxy assembly , we look at the contribution of star formation to the growth of stellar mass in galaxies as a function of time .",
    "several groups have determined stellar masses of galaxies from redshift surveys with multiwavelength observations in the local universe ( 2df , @xcite ; sdss @xcite ; sdss & 2mass , @xcite ) and at high redshift ( @xcite ) .    here",
    "we investigate the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) , which measures the star formation rate ( sfr ) per unit galaxy stellar mass , to study explicitly how star formation contributes to galaxy growth for galaxies of different masses at different times in the history of the universe .",
    "the ssfr has been studied at low redshifts @xcite and intermediate redshifts @xcite but no significant study of ssfr evolution over a wide range of galaxy masses and redshift has been undertaken .",
    "high mass galaxies at high redshifts are just now beginning to be studied @xcite .",
    "@xcite used rest - frame @xmath1-band ( 2.2@xmath8 m ) luminosities and [ oii]@xmath9 equivalent widths to show that galaxies with rapid star formation decrease in @xmath1 luminosity , and therefore mass , with decreasing redshift . @xcite inferred stellar masses of galaxies and pointed out a generally increasing ssfr with redshift and a trend for low mass galaxies to exhibit larger ssfrs .",
    "we combine two complementary redshift surveys to broaden the mass and redshift range that we can probe .",
    "the wide - area , medium deep munics @xcite spectroscopic dataset provides intermediate to high mass galaxies typically in the mass range of @xmath10 .",
    "the fors deep field @xcite covers a small portion of the sky very deeply , contributing @xmath11  @xmath12   galaxies to the sample .",
    "we discuss the samples used and the methodology for determining sfrs and galaxy masses in section 2 .",
    "we describe the results of this study , possible selection effects and complete a comparison to the local universe in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we present a discussion of the physical implications of our results as well as a comparison to the literature .    throughout this letter",
    "we adopt an @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 cosmology .",
    "the munics project is a wide - area , medium - deep , photometric and spectroscopic survey selected in the @xmath1-band and reaching @xmath16 .",
    "it covers nearly one square degree in the @xmath1 and @xmath17 bands with follow - up imaging in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands over 0.5 square degrees @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy is complete to @xmath20 over 0.25 square degrees and reaches @xmath21 for 100 square arcmins .",
    "the spectra cover a wide wavelength range of @xmath22 at @xmath23 ( fwhm ) resolution , sampling galaxies in the redshift range of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "our munics sample contains 175 objects , which are mostly massive ( @xmath25@xmath12 ) field galaxies with detectable [ oii]@xmath263727 emission .    the fors deep field ( fdf ) spectroscopic survey provides low - resolution spectra with detectable [ oii]@xmath9 in the spectral window ( @xmath27 at @xmath28 ( fwhm ) resolution ) to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the fdf survey is @xmath29-band selected reaching @xmath30 with spectroscopy to @xmath31 .",
    "the fdf covers @xmath32 x @xmath32 in eight bands : ubgrizjk @xcite .",
    "our fdf sample includes 168 galaxies with detectable star formation , and masses of mostly @xmath33@xmath12 .",
    "stellar masses of galaxies are determined , as described in @xcite , by fitting a grid of composite stellar population models of varying age , star formation history , and dust extinction to multi - wavelength photometry to determine mass - to - light ( @xmath34 ) ratios .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty in the @xmath34 ratio is about 25% @xcite .",
    "we have developed a program to automatically measure emission line fluxes , equivalent widths and continuum breaks from flux calibrated spectra . to each rest - frame emission line region of interest , we fit a gaussian profile plus a polynomial continuum , using the spectral resolution as a first guess at the line width .",
    "errors in measurements are determined by fitting spectral regions multiple times with different continuum estimates .",
    "this program gives us a consistent flux measurement between the galaxy samples measured in this study .",
    "as an sfr indicator , we use the flux of the [ oii]@xmath9 emission feature which remains in the spectral window from low redshift to @xmath0 .",
    "we use the kennicutt ( 1998 , equation 3 ) conversion from [ oii ] line luminosity to sfr in units of solar masses per year .",
    "[ f : hist ] demonstrates the similarity between the redshift distributions of the full spectroscopic samples ( dashed lines ) and star forming sub - samples ( solid lines ) used in this study from munics ( fig .",
    "1__a _ _ ) and fdf ( fig .",
    "1__b _ _ ) .",
    "the majority of galaxies in the full samples have detectable star formation and the distributions match very well , indicating little redshift bias in making this selection of objects .",
    "there are fewer star forming galaxies in the munics sample at the lowest redshifts with only six low redshift munics galaxies excluded because of the [ oii]@xmath263727 emission line being blueward of the spectral coverage . for munics , 52% of the spectroscopic sample shows star formation .    for the fdf galaxy sample ,",
    "75% of all galaxies with @xmath35 show detectable star formation via the [ oii]@xmath9 emission feature . the higher fraction of star forming galaxies in fdf is understandable since the fdf spectroscopic absolute magnitude limit is deeper than munics and fainter galaxies tend to have more star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .    fig .",
    "[ f : hist ] also shows the distribution of sfrs seen among the two samples of galaxies split into redshift bins .",
    "munics galaxies are shown in figure 1__c _ _ with the dashed histogram representing @xmath36 and the solid histogram showing the range of @xmath37 .",
    "figure 1__d _ _ shows the fdf sfr distribution with the same redshift bins in addition to a high redshift bin shown by the dotted histogram for @xmath38 . the maximum sfr increases with redshift , and is consistent between the two samples .    fig .",
    "[ f : ssfr ] shows the ssfr versus galaxy stellar mass , as a function of redshift .",
    "a sample of sdss galaxies is shown in the lowest redshift bin as crosses and described in detail below .",
    "the solid diagonal line in each panel indicates a constant sfr = 1@xmath12yr@xmath6 .",
    "lines of constant sfr are parallel to this line and sfrs increase to the upper right .",
    "the vertical dashed line designates a galaxy with @xmath39@xmath12 .",
    "the short vertical dotted line shows the limiting munics galaxy stellar mass for each redshift bin .",
    "the diagonal dotted and dashed lines show limits for detectable ssfr for munics and fdf , respectively , derived from their spectroscopic sensitivity limits .",
    "several features are evident at each epoch in this plot . low to intermediate mass galaxies",
    "form a `` ridge '' of ssfr that lies parallel to the solid diagonal line of constant sfr .",
    "the ridge remains as mass increases until , at some high mass , there appears to be a turnover mass , above which the ssfr decreases .",
    "this turnover mass increases with redshift accompanied by higher mass galaxies showing higher ssfrs at earlier times .",
    "this behavior has been termed downsizing by @xcite .",
    "there exists a general correlation between ssfr and mass at low redshift ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "we show evidence here for a ridge in ssfr that evolves with redshift independent of galaxy stellar mass for the full range of @xmath40 .",
    "the average ssfr at a given mass on the ridge decreases from @xmath0 to @xmath7 so that the average ssfr for a low mass galaxy at @xmath0 is roughly 1 dex higher than the average ssfr of a low mass galaxy at @xmath41 .",
    "galaxies with sfr@xmath42 @xmath12yr@xmath6 , below the ssfr ridge , are increasingly too faint to detect as redshift increases , as shown by the diagonal dashed line in fig .",
    "[ f : ssfr ] .",
    "the region below the ssfr ridge of galaxies in fig .",
    "[ f : ssfr ] could also be populated by galaxies that are not forming stars at the time of observation .",
    "galaxies of @xmath43 exist at low ssfr , showing that they form fewer stars compared to the lower mass galaxies .",
    "the turnover mass refers to the mass at which the ssfr noticeably decreases from the ridge .",
    "we note that , while detecting the lowest values of sfr is affected by incompleteness , more than 50% of the galaxies have detectable star formation and the upper bound of the ssfr ridge has no selection effects .",
    "we make no corrections for extinction to the emission line fluxes in the present study for multiple reasons .",
    "we only measure h@xmath44 for those galaxies at @xmath45 , and can only measure a balmer decrement at low redshift .",
    "in addition , we only have h@xmath46 line flux measurements for 10% of the galaxies . for those galaxies with measurements of both h@xmath44 and h@xmath46",
    "we find an average @xmath47 , assuming a case b recombination .",
    "galaxy samples selected at mid and far infrared wavelengths would likely yield some starbursting galaxies with higher sfrs and would be affected by dust extinction .",
    "we feel it would be irrelevant to apply a flat , generic low redshift correction to all galaxies here , because while it would increase the global star formation density by 50% , it would not change the differential star formation effects studied here .",
    "if we were to apply a mass - dependent extinction correction , the slope of the ssfr ridge would change , but the differential effects with redshift would remain identical .",
    "the trends seen among the fdf and munics galaxy surveys exhibit similar evolution in their overlapping mass range around @xmath48@xmath12  and are therefore suitable to analyze simultaneously to cover such a large range of galaxy stellar mass .",
    "there are few fdf galaxies present in the lowest redshift bin in fig .",
    "[ f : ssfr ] as anticipated since the fdf covers little volume at low redshift .",
    "the lack of massive galaxies in the @xmath49 bins also shows the small volume of the fdf in addition to the spectroscopic limit for detecting massive galaxies . in order to verify that the increase in ssfr at higher redshifts is not due to rarer objects being seen",
    "as larger volumes are probed , we investigate the trends in ssfr from the sdss .",
    "we gathered sdss galaxies @xcite selected to match the munics magnitude limits from the sample described in @xcite , who determined galaxy stellar masses following the same method as the rest of our sample .",
    "we used the [ oii]@xmath263727 flux as reported by sdss and followed the @xcite conversion to sfr .",
    "we chose a random sample of sdss galaxies to match the number of galaxies in the lowest redshift bin from munics and fdf and show them in fig .",
    "[ f : ssfr ] as crosses .",
    "the ssfrs of the sdss galaxies are consistent with the munics values in this redshift bin , which we confirmed by repeating the selection multiple times . out of the whole sdss sample ,",
    "only 1.15% lie above the 1 @xmath12yr@xmath6  constant sfr line .",
    "hence , if the abundance of galaxies above this line at high redshift were only due to the larger volume sampled , we would expect only such a small fraction of objects to lie above this line .",
    "we present a study of the contribution of star formation to galaxy growth from @xmath0 to the present .",
    "we investigate the ssfr as a function of redshift and galaxy stellar mass over five decades in galaxy stellar mass .",
    "at all redshifts , the ssfr decreases as stellar mass increases .",
    "this indicates a higher contribution of star formation to the growth of low mass galaxies since @xmath0 and suggests that high mass galaxies formed the bulk of their stellar content earlier than @xmath3 . the drop in ssfr for high mass ( @xmath50@xmath12 ) galaxies above the turnover mass for each epoch seen in fig .",
    "[ f : ssfr ] is symptomatic of higher mass galaxies tending to be the early - type , redder population which forms few stars after @xmath3 .",
    "this result is compatible with the detection of massive galaxies at @xmath49 @xcite and the mass - dependent sfr from @xmath7 to @xmath51 suggested by @xcite .",
    "[ f : ssfr ] shows evidence of a ridge in ssfr that runs parallel to lines of constant sfr .",
    "the ridge exists for all galaxy stellar masses @xmath52@xmath12  and increases uniformly , independent of mass as redshift increases .",
    "the first evidence for such a ridge in ssfr was noted by @xcite .",
    "our work moves beyond that study with a mass limited sample at each redshift bin and a wide range of masses .    the ridge in ssfr shifts downward as redshift decreases indicating a steady decrease in the global sfr by a factor of 10 from @xmath3 to @xmath7 , as widely noted in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "previous studies have not differentiated whether the decline in the global sfr is experienced by galaxies of all types or specific to a limited galaxy population .",
    "our study shows a uniform change in sfr independent of galaxy stellar mass .    using nearly 10@xmath53 sdss galaxies ,",
    "@xcite study several properties of star forming galaxies at @xmath54 .",
    "they show the observed likelihood distribution of ssfr versus stellar mass in their figure 24 which demonstrates the existence of a ssfr ridge .",
    "this ridge is compatible with the one shown in this work if identical sfr conversions and extinction corrections are applied to the [ oii]@xmath263727 emission line flux as shown in the low redshift panel of fig .",
    "[ f : ssfr ] .",
    "our comparison to sdss galaxies reveals that our findings are not the result of more extreme galaxies being detected as more volume is sampled .",
    "galaxies exist on fig .",
    "[ f : ssfr ] only when the star formation induces detectable amounts of [ oii]@xmath263727 emission . at any epoch",
    "a majority of galaxies ( @xmath55 ) show detectable star formation with sfrs lying on the ssfr ridge .",
    "galaxies with @xmath56@xmath12  could sustain the observed sfrs for a doubling time of order the hubble time , without moving significantly on fig .",
    "[ f : ssfr ] , but the sfr is observed to decrease over time , presumably because of gas depletion .    galaxies with @xmath57@xmath12  likely evolve differently .",
    "low mass galaxies sustaining the observed sfrs would significantly evolve on fig .",
    "[ f : ssfr ] from @xmath3 to @xmath7 so that we would see more intermediate mass galaxies with sfr  @xmath58 @xmath12yr@xmath6 at @xmath7 , which is not evident .",
    "a galaxy of mass , @xmath59@xmath12 , with constant sfr = 1 @xmath12yr@xmath6 has a doubling time of the stellar population of @xmath60yrs .",
    "such a galaxy , with a typical gas fraction of order 1 @xcite , could only sustain this rate of star formation for a short period of time before the gas supply diminishes ( if we assume no significant gas infall ) .",
    "therefore , it is likely that these galaxies exist on fig .",
    "[ f : ssfr ] during periodic starbursts .",
    "if gas depletes during each burst then subsequent bursts would exhibit progressively lower sfrs , consistent with the observed trend .",
    "the duty cycle must be at least 50% , since the majority of the galaxies have detected star formation .",
    "if there exists a transition mass between the two separate modes of star formation ( sustained or periodic bursts ) , then the coherence of the trend of the ssfr ridge decreasing with redshift independent of mass is particularly interesting .    we wish to thank karl gebhardt and sheila kannappan for useful discussions .",
