    "in recent years , reliable distance - redshift relations up to @xmath1 have been revealed by observations of type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "comparisons of the data obtained from these observations with the predictions from friedmann - lematre ( fl ) homogeneous and isotropic universe models suggest that the universe is in a phase of accelerated expansion , and there must exist unidentified dark energy that causes the acceleration .",
    "the nature of dark energy has been investigated by many researchers @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the possibilities have been discussed that the distance - redshift relations provided by the observations of type ia supernovae may be reproduced by taking account of the inhomogeneities in the matter distribution and geometry without dark energy .",
    "one of such models is the so - called void model , in which existence of a large scale underdense region ( void ) is assumed .",
    "actually , an inhomogeneous distribution of matter of scale @xmath2 mpc ( the hubble constant is @xmath3 km / s / mpc ) was suggested by several authors  @xcite in galactic surveys , and a void on scales of about @xmath4 mpc was found by blanton _",
    "et al_.  @xcite in the sdss commissioning data .",
    "these results suggest that we might live in a local void with a radius of @xmath2mpc .",
    "motivated by these observations , tomita  @xcite sought to reproduce the distance - redshift relations using a model in which a homogeneous spherical region around us is less dense than the background .",
    "more recently , alnes _",
    "et al_.  @xcite ( also , @xcite ) showed that there exists a model that provides a good fit to the type ia supernova observations ( as well as other kinds ) , assuming that the outside of a spherical region is homogeneous and isotropic but the inside of it is described by the lemaitre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) spherically symmetric dust solution  @xcite .",
    "et al_.  @xcite showed that if the arbitrary functions in the ltb solution are determined so that the distance - redshift relation in the ltb spacetime coincides with that of the @xmath5cdm model , the resulting model has a void structure on scales of a few gpc .",
    "the essential mechanism for these void models to be able to reproduce the distance - redshift relations provided by the observations is that the local hubble expansion rate monotonically decreases as the distance increases so that the incoming light rays experience effective increase in the expansion rate .    in reality , however , the matter distribution in the universe is not isotropic , and the distance - redshift relation inferred by the observational data should be considered as an average over all the directions of sight .",
    "this point seems to have been largely ignored in the literature . to take into account the effect caused by these anisotropies , we in this paper start with the optical scalar equation in general inhomogeneous and anisotropic spacetimes , and then take an average of a form of this equation ( distance equation ) over the spheres on the past light cone .",
    "we find that after some estimates , the resulting equation coincides with the one in the ltb universe with the matter density @xmath6 formally replaced by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a certain function of @xmath9 .",
    "in other words , the equation coincides with the one obtained as a dyer - roeder - like  @xcite extension of the distance equation in the ltb universe . with this effective equation",
    ", we numerically investigate light properties of void models including effects of anisotropy .",
    "mattsson  @xcite has recently discussed a similar generalization of the dyer - roeder equation , arguing principally that the original dyer - roeder extension did not take into account spatial inhomogeneities in expansion rate . to incorporate these inhomogeneities",
    ", he replaced the hubble expansion rate @xmath10 in the dyer - roeder equation with @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being an arbitrary function of @xmath9 .",
    "we do not have to artificially introduce a phenomenological function like @xmath12 , since we start with a general inhomogeneous and anisotropic setting , which naturally leads to an equation with the effect of inhomogeneities in both matter density and expansion rate .",
    "moreover , the inhomogeneity and anisotropy we consider is supposed to be made by smooth distribution of dark matter , rather than the spiky clumpiness by galaxies as assumed in mattsson  @xcite and in dyer and roeder  @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ main ] , we derive our effective distance equation by means of averaging . in section [ numsol ]",
    ", we consider a specific void model and numerically solve the effective distance equation to search the parameter space for the best values that are most likely to explain observational data .",
    "section [ conclusion ] is devoted to conclusion and some remarks .",
    "appendix [ originald - r ] provides a review for the original dyer - roeder extension . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use @xmath13 as the speed of light .",
    "in the first subsection below , we transform the optical scalar equation to derive an equation for the angular - diameter distance @xmath14 in an inhomogeneous and anisotropic dust universe .",
    "we then specialize the equation to the ltb spherically symmetric dust universe case for later use . in the second subsection , we take a spherical average of the general distance equation to make the equation suitable for comparisons with observational data .",
    "we start with the optical scalar equation  @xcite , which determines the variations of the cross sectional area of a null geodesic congruence .",
    "let us assume that the null geodesics in the congruence arrive at the observer through paths that are sufficiently far from strong inhomogeneities such as galaxies .",
    "this allows us to ignore the gravitational lensing effect , and in turn , the shear and rotation of the congruence .",
    "the optical scalar equation in this case becomes @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the cross sectional area of the congruence , @xmath17 the null geodesic generator , @xmath18 the affine parameter , and @xmath19 the ricci tensor . on the other hand , einstein s equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the energy momentum tensor , implies @xmath22 since @xmath17 is null . with the relation @xmath23 for the angular diameter distance",
    "@xmath14 , we obtain @xmath24 from eqs.([eq : sachs ] ) and ( [ eq : r2 t ] ) . the only energy content we consider is dust , so that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the energy density for dust , @xmath27 the 4-velocity of dust .",
    "the frequency of the light observed by a comoving observer at a given @xmath28 with 4-velocity @xmath27 is given by @xmath29 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the second term in the left hand side of eq.([eq : ray ] ) yields @xmath30 where we have used the definition of redshift @xmath9 , @xmath31 .",
    "thus , eq.([eq : ray ] ) can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the second order linear derivative operator defined by @xmath34 we stress that this equation is valid for any dust universe , as long as the gravitational lensing effect along the geodesics we consider can be ignored .",
    "note also that solving this equation requires another equation ( geodesic equation ) to relate @xmath28 with @xmath9 , for given @xmath26 .",
    "next , we specialize the last equation to the ltb spherically symmetric spacetime case with the observer at the symmetry center . the essential part of our task is to convert @xmath35 to @xmath36 for the case .",
    "the ltb metric is given by @xmath37 where the ` energy function ' @xmath38 is an arbitrary function concerning curvature .",
    "the circumferential radius @xmath39 is the solution for the generalized friedmann equation @xmath40 where the ` mass function ' @xmath41 is another arbitrary function , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the derivatives with respect to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .    using the analytic function @xmath46 introduced in ref.@xcite , the solution @xmath47 can be represented simply as @xmath48 where the ` big - bang function ' @xmath49 is a third arbitrary function .",
    "the function @xmath46 is the unique solution of the first order ordinary differential equation @xmath50 that intersects the @xmath51 axis transversely @xcite .",
    "this function is non - negative , monotonically decreasing , and defined for @xmath52 .",
    "as for the dust matter , the 4-velocity is given by @xmath53 , and the energy density by @xmath54    now , suppose that the light we observe progresses along a path @xmath55 for decreasing @xmath28 with @xmath56 corresponding to the observer , so that @xmath57",
    ". then , we obtain @xmath58 since @xmath59 . on the other hand , the radial geodesic equation for @xmath60 and the null condition , respectively ,",
    "give us @xmath61 using these equations , we immediately have @xmath62 where we have defined the effective hubble function @xmath63 , @xmath64    consequently , eq.([eq : generald - r ] ) yields @xmath65 where @xmath66,\\ ] ] and @xmath67 represents the angular - diameter distance in the ltb universe .",
    "note that this equation is the same as the one for the fl universe ( see eq.([eq : d - rflrwda ] ) in appendix [ originald - r ] ) with the hubble function replaced by eq.([eq : hltb ] ) .",
    "( this is the reason we call @xmath68 the effective hubble function . )",
    "note also that the effective hubble function @xmath69 coincides with the so - called longitudinal hubble function @xmath70 ; in contrast , the perpendicular hubble function @xmath71 plays no role in determining the distance .      in this subsection",
    ", we take a spherical average of the distance equation ( [ eq : generald - r ] ) and compare it with the one for the isotropic spacetime eq.([eq :",
    "d - rltb ] ) .    for our purpose ,",
    "the most convenient is to take a particular coordinate system that is based on a foliation of spacetime by past light cones of a timelike curve .",
    "we employ a spherical null coordinate system @xmath72 such that @xmath73 on each light cone , that @xmath74 corresponds to the vertex of each light cone , that the timelike curve the vertices @xmath74 comprise coincides with the orbit of matter flow there , and that the angular coordinates @xmath75 are constant along each null geodesic that reaches the vertex @xmath74 .",
    "( this choice of angular coordinates is possible at least in the domain where the null geodesics do not intersect each other . )",
    "the radial null coordinate @xmath9 is chosen to give the redshift along each null geodesic labeled by @xmath76 .",
    "our observation is supposed to be done at the coordinate center @xmath74 at a certain instant @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the angular - diameter distance to an object observed in the direction @xmath75 with redshift @xmath9 .",
    "this is a function of @xmath9 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , but we will often regard this as a function of @xmath9 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 being parameters , since we mostly consider its variations along the null geodesic , in which situation @xmath79 and @xmath80 are constant .",
    "we will therefore use @xmath36 instead of @xmath81 when it acts on @xmath78 .",
    "the same rule will be applied to other functions as well .",
    "let us define the spherical average of a function @xmath82 by @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",

    "we wish to estimate how much different the averaged distance function @xmath89 is from an ltb distance function @xmath90 . to this",
    ", we match an ltb solution with the given inhomogeneous and anisotropic universe according to the following correspondence : @xmath91 since the ltb solution possesses two arbitrary physical functions ( one of the three arbitrary functions corresponds to gauge ) , it is natural to expect that these two conditions are satisfied for a suitable choice of these functions .",
    "( strictly speaking , asserting this leads to a variation of the inverse problem for the ltb solution , which we consider out of our scope . for a discussion of the standard version of the inverse problem ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite . )    # 1#1 # 1#1    keeping this correspondence in mind ,",

    "furthermore , according to the cmb observation , the perturbation of the expansion rate is about @xmath113  @xcite on scales of @xmath114 , which implies that the second order terms in @xmath115 are much smaller than the second order term in @xmath116 if @xmath117 .",
