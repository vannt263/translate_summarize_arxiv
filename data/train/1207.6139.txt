    "nitride compounds of rare - earth ( re ) ions have gained attention due to their interesting magnetic and electronic properties . with the exception of ce the re ions are in their preferred trivalent state in the nitrides , so that their magnetic characters originate from their incompletely filled _ 4f _ shell .",
    "they are predicted to be half metals or ferromagnetic semiconductors ; thus they are strong candidates for use in spintronic devices.@xcite among the rare - earth nitride ( ren ) family , gdn is the most thoroughly studied@xcite compound .",
    "the gd@xmath3 ion has half filled 4__f _ _ shell with spin moment@xcite of 7@xmath4 .",
    "its nitride is now a well established ferromagnetic semiconductor @xcite with t@xmath5=70  k , though a lower @xcite t@xmath5=30 k is also reported .",
    "it has an optical energy gap @xcite of 1.3 ev in its paramagnetic state and 0.98 ev in ferromagnetic state .",
    "most of the other rens are known to be ferromagnetic with lower curie temperatures ; the exception@xcite is eun , which can not order due to the @xmath6 state of the 4__f _ _ shell in eu@xmath3 .",
    "the present work describes an experimental study of dyn .",
    "it is a ferromagnetic semiconductor with a reported@xcite t@xmath5 ranging between 17 and 26 k. lsda+u electronic structure calculations @xcite predict that seven spin - majority 4__f _ _ states occur in three deep narrow bands while two 4__f _ _ electrons go in minority - spin bands 5  ev below the top of the valence band .",
    "the same study shows a small indirect gap between the top of the valence band at @xmath7 and the conduction band minimum at x and a minimum direct gap of 1.17  ev at x.    there are decades - old reports @xcite of absorption edges of almost all rens , with the exception of cen and pmn , though it is now recognised that those early materials were subject to the formation of nitrogen vacancies and decomposition as oxides in air .",
    "in particular dyn has been reported to show an onset of absorption ranging@xcite from 2.9  ev to 0.91  ev .",
    "preston @xcite _ et al .",
    "_ reported the measured gap value of @xmath8 1.5 ev between x - ray absorption and emission spectroscopies . in the wake of these widely deviating claims",
    ", there is a vital need for a systematic experimental study of dyn .",
    "here we report reflection / transmission measurements from 0.5  ev to 5.0  ev to determine the optical gap and seek evidence of optical transitions above gap , and far infrared reflection measurements of the zone - center phonon frequency .",
    "thin films of dyn were prepared at ambient temperature by depositing dy at a rate of 0.5 - 2  s@xmath9 in the presence of 10@xmath10 - 10@xmath11 mbar of carefully purified n@xmath12 , as has been described in more detail previously.@xcite it is expected that , as is true for gdn , a high concentration of nitrogen - vacancy donors will be found in any but the films grown in the highest n@xmath12 pressures .",
    "the nitrogen vacancies each bind either one or two electrons , leaving at least one electron in the conduction band.@xcite    before depositing the films the chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of less than 10@xmath13 mbar , and residual gasses were reduced further during deposition by the gettering effect of dy . due to the propensity of the rare - earth nitride thin films to atmosphere , these films need to be passivated with a capping layer .",
    "the choice of substrate and cap was dictated by the measurements to be made : sapphire and mgf@xmath12 for the near - visible range , yttria - stabilised zirconia and si for the far infrared .",
    "xrd was performed to establish the crystal structure , lattice constant and orientation of the films .",
    "magnetic measurements were performed with a quantum design mpms superconducting quantum interference device .",
    "the resistances of the films were monitored both _ in situ _ during growth and _ ex situ _ as a function of temperature .",
    "transmission and reflection spectra were obtained for al@xmath12o@xmath14/dyn / mgf@xmath12 in the energy range of 0.5 - 2.0 ev using a fourier transform spectrometer ( bomem model da8 ) and from 1 to 6 ev using a conventional visible - uv spectrometer .",
    "a gold film and quartz wedge were used as the comparison standard for reflectance measurements in the infra - red and visible regions respectively .",
    "reflectance measurements were performed for light incident on both the film and substrate surfaces , but since the transmittance is unaffected by the direction that light traverses through the sample it was taken from one side alone . the partially reflected and transmitted rays interfere to form a complex interference pattern that can compete with the loss of transmission signalling the absorption edge . in order to extract the optical constants of the dyn layer",
    "a commercial software tfcalc was used which makes use of characteristic matrix method .",
    "the unpolarized near - normal infrared ( ir ) reflectance spectra were taken using a bruker ifs 113v ftir spectrometer in the spectral range of 30 - 3000 @xmath1 with a resolution of 2 @xmath1 .",
    "each of the reflectance spectra was evaluated as a two - layer optical system .",
    "@xcite at first , the bare substrate reflectivity was measured and carefully fitted using the generalized factorized damped harmonic oscillator model    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are transverse and longitudinal frequencies of the @xmath18-th polar phonon , respectively , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are their damping constants , and @xmath21 denotes the high frequency permittivity resulting from electronic absorption processes .",
    "the complex dielectric function @xmath22 is related to the reflectivity @xmath23 of the bulk substrate by    @xmath24    the high - frequency permittivity @xmath25 of the substrate resulting from the electronic absorption processes was obtained from the frequency independent reflectivity tail above the phonon frequency .",
    "when analyzing the reflectance of the substrate together with the film , we used the bare substrate parameters and adjusted only the dielectric function of the film . for this purpose",
    ", we preferentially used a classical three - parameter damped oscillator model    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the dielectric strength of the @xmath18-th mode .",
    "figure  [ xrd ] shows the xrd scan of a typical dyn film , in this case on sapphire and with a capping layer of mgf@xmath12 .",
    "the strongest peak comes from the sapphire substrate while the next prominent peak labelled as [ 111 ] and a rather weak [ 222 ] peak are attributed to the cubic structure of dyn .",
    "the films are strongly [ 111 ] textured , similar to other re nitrides grown at ambient temperature @xcite .",
    "the lattice constant of the films is 0.490  nm as expected@xcite and the average crystallite size is about 10 nm as obtained using scherrer formula .",
    "there are no secondary phases detected in the xrd spectra .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    figure  [ resis ] shows the the temperature - dependent resistivity of a film grown at high n@xmath12 pressure .",
    "the room - temperature resistivity of 100 m@xmath28 cm leads then to a carrier concentration of less than 10@xmath29 @xmath30 , characteristic of a moderately doped semiconductor for assumed mean free paths of 1 - 10 nm .",
    "the semiconducting nature of the film is confirmed by a strongly rising resistivity with decreasing temperature .",
    "a relatively flat peak near the ferromagnetic curie temperature ( @xmath31 , see below ) is then followed at lower temperature by a continuation of the rise , affirming a semiconducting ground state below @xmath31 .    [ h ]     the magnetic susceptibility follows the curie - weiss expectation with an estimated curie temperature of 20 k. however , the hysteretic behaviour of the lower - temperature ferromagnetic phase persists to higher temperature so we quote t@xmath5 as lying between 20 k and 25 k , in agreement with the higher values found in the literature.@xcite    turning our attention towards the main features of this work , figure  [ rt ] shows reflectance ( r ) , transmittance ( t ) and their sum for a dyn film grown under a high n@xmath12 partial pressure , as obtained from its cap side .",
    "focusing on the low energy region ( 0.5 ev-1.0 ev ) first , we find that the absorptance ( 1-r - t ) is zero within 2@xmath32 uncertainty , as establishing a very low free carrier density expected of a semiconductor and signalling that this energy range is below the interband edge . above 1.2  ev",

    "to first approximation , the absorption below the edge was initially set to zero , as is in any case indicated by r+t=1 .",
    "the refractive index of 2.0 was then determined by fitting the transmission spectra below the band edge ; even the average value of transmission ensures that this is the refractive index in this energy range .",
    "next , with this value of the refractive index approximated as constant above the edge , values of _ k _ were extracted by fitting the absorption spectra .",
    "spectral dependence of refractive index was then allowed , but the variations were below the level of confidence so we quote a refractive index of 2.0@xmath33 .",
    "the circles in figure  [ rt ] show a comparison between the calculated and measured r / t spectra .",
    "we regard the fit as reasonable ; the computer program calculates optical spectra for perfect interfaces and uniform films , but in reality one expects the films to show some degree of interface roughness and also we do not know thickness of the film very accurately",
    ".    figure  [ epsi ] shows the imaginary part of the dielectric function calculated by using @xmath34 where _ n _ and _ k _ were obtained from the fits above .",
    "the absorption increases monotonically with energy , showing no structure that might result from interband onsets at any energy above the first optical absorption edge .",
    "the rapid drop near the edge extrapolates to a gap of about 1.2  ev , with a tail to lower energy that we believe is related to uncertainties in the parameters due to incomplete correction for the interference fringes .",
    "it agrees within uncertainty with the x - point gap of 1.17 ev predicted by larson@xcite _",
    "et al . _        two further films",
    "have been studied , grown with substantially smaller excess nitrogen flux as indicated in table i. as expected the higher density of n@xmath12 vacancies in these films lead to free - carrier absorption below 1.2 ev , with absorption coefficient at 0.5 ev also listed in the table .",
    "it is clear that a reduced n@xmath12/dy ratio leads to sub - gap absorption , as is expected for the higher density of nitrogen vacancy dopants that has earlier been reported for a lowered n@xmath12 pressure during rare earth nitride growth.@xcite    figure 5 illustrates the relation between free carriers and band gap with n@xmath12/dy flux ratio during growth .",
    "film a , grown with a n@xmath12/dy ratio of 250 , is close to stoichiometric , and accordingly the subgap absorption is below the measurement limit .",
    "films b and c , grown with lower n@xmath12/dy flux ratio , have a larger concentration of n@xmath12 vacancies and finite sub - gap absorption . to estimate the free - carrier concentration we note that in the high frequency limit @xmath35 the absorption coefficient is given by    @xmath36    applying this to the films in question , and assuming an effective mass in the conduction band of m@xmath37  0.2 estimated from the dyn bandstructure,@xcite the concentration of free carriers in film a was estimated to be @xmath3810@xmath29 @xmath30 , in agreement with the inference drawn above from the resistivity .",
    "for films grown at lower n@xmath12/dy flux we have found carrier concentrations of order 10@xmath39 @xmath30 .",
    "those carriers are accommodated in the three electron pockets at x , and then introduce a degenerate electron gas of fermi energy 0.2 ev and 0.3 ev in films b and c , respectively , in agreement with the moss - burstein shift of the absorption edge seen in fig .  5 .",

    "films grown with low n@xmath12/dy ratios show enahnced free carrier absorption and a significant moss - burstein shift . ]    turning now to the far infrared data we show in figure 6 the reflectivity of the bare ysz substrate and of the si - capped dyn film on the ysz substrate .",
    "these data can be fitted with only two damped oscillators ; the dominant to phonon expected in the nacl structure is here at 280 @xmath1 , damping constant 160 @xmath1 ; the frequency is somewhat lower than the estimated 338 @xmath1 based on an lsda+@xmath40 approximation.@xcite the mode gives a contribution of 20 to the dc dielectric constant ( figure 7 ) , though this number is sensitive to the assumed film thickness , which was not accurately known .",
    "the satisfactory fit required also a weaker resonance at 1200 @xmath1 , damping 2400 @xmath1 and dielectric contribution of 1.8 .",
    "we assign this to a transition from nitrogen vacancy states expected to lie close below the conduction band.@xcite the fit also returns a high - frequency dielectric constant of 4.4 , in reasonable agreement with the near ir refractive index of 2.0@xmath410.1 .",
