    "two main baryonic constituents of the diffuse intracluster medium ( icm ) are the diffuse hot ( @xmath3 k ) , tenuous ( @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 ) icm and a rarely visible non - thermal population of extremely high energy relativistic particles .",
    "the presence of gev electrons / positrons ( of largely unknown origin ) is inferred from the diffuse synchrotron radio emission in a fraction of galaxy clusters , which lacks an obvious association with any of the cluster galaxies .",
    "these radio sources , which usually possess large size ( @xmath20.1 - 1 mpc ) and steep spectra ( @xmath7 1 - 3 ; s@xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 ) , are called _",
    "`` radio halos '' _ if they permeate the cluster centers and _ `` radio relics '' _ if they are located at the cluster peripheral regions ( e.g. , the review by ferrari et al . 2008 ) .",
    "since radio halos and relics are exclusively found in the clusters clearly showing x - ray or optical substructure @xcite , their origin is related to the merging processes of galaxy clusters , although its details are still obscure . signatures of giant shock waves arising from cluster mergers have been discovered in recent years @xcite , and such collisionless shocks are capable of accelerating the particles to relativistic energies , giving rise to the radio relics via in - situ diffusive shock acceleration of electrons ( primary electrons ) .",
    "the radio halos may arise via turbulent energy injection or in - situ acceleration of protons with the secondary production of relativistic electrons and positrons by inelastic @xmath11 collisions ( secondary electrons ) @xcite .",
    "the free thermal electrons of hot icm inverse compton scatter the photons of cosmic microwave background ( cmbr ) .",
    "this results in a predictable spectral distortion of cmbr toward the cluster which is the well - known thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite .",
    "the sz effect is an exceptional tool for the study of clusters as the surface brightness of sz signal is independent of redshift and depends only on the integrated thermal pressure of icm along the line - of - sight .",
    "the total sz signal , being a measure of thermal energy of the cluster , tightly correlates with the cluster mass , making it a powerful , unbiased tool for making volume limited samples and for finding the high redshift and the most massive clusters @xcite . of particular interest is to investigate how the sz signal correlates with other cluster properties , such as the mass , temperature and x - ray luminosity ( the `` scaling relations '' ) , while departure from scaling relations indicate non - gravitational and non - thermal heating processes in strongly merging systems .",
    "the space telescope designed for the study of cmbr and its anisotropy , has recently also been used for studying the sz decrement @xcite .",
    "the ongoing  sz survey provides sky images at nine frequencies in the range 30857 ghz and is the first all - sky survey capable of blindly searching for distant and massive clusters , since the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) in the x - ray domain .",
    "a sample of sz detected clusters in the   early release catalog ( esz ) is described in detail in planck collaboration ( 2011b ) .",
    "the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n @xmath12 ) sample of 189 clusters is derived from a blind multi - frequency search in the all - sky maps from the first 10 months of observations . out of these , 20 are new , hitherto unknown clusters which are above the esz high signal - to - noise selection criterion .",
    "twenty - five clusters have been observed to date with  in snapshot exposures ( @xmath2 10 - 20 ks ) , with 10 in the lower s / n ratio category ( @xmath13 s / n @xmath14 ) and 15 in high - significance range with s / n @xmath15 .",
    "a total of 21 cluster candidates are validated as extended x - ray sources , the majority of which show highly irregular and dynamically perturbed structure of merging systems @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we report the discovery of giant ( @xmath11  mpc ) non - thermal peripheral double radio relics of an unprecedented scale ( separation @xmath24.4 mpc at redshift 0.39 ) in a massive galaxy cluster , detected solely through a blind sz search by . in view of its extreme x - ray properties and non - relaxed morphology ,",
    "we have imaged it with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , and also obtained deep optical images with the 2 m telescope at the iucaa girawali observatory ( igo ) .",
    "these observations have revealed this cluster to be highly unusual in terms of its morphology , mass , richness and non - thermal emission , relating to its complex dynamical state .",
    "we adopt a @xmath16cdm cosmology with @xmath17  km  s@xmath18  mpc@xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , resulting in scale of 5.26 kpc  arcsec@xmath18 ( or 3.17 arcmin  mpc@xmath18 ) for a redshift 0.39 . below @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the total mass and radius corresponding to a total density contrast @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the critical density of the universe at redshift @xmath25 .",
    "our target  is the second most significant detection ( s / n@xmath2610.2 ) among the 20 new clusters of the  esz sample @xcite .",
    "a 10  ks x - ray validation exposure taken with  reveals an extremely hot ( @xmath27 kev ) , luminous ( @xmath28 kev ) = @xmath29 erg  s@xmath18 within @xmath30 ) , and massive ( estimated @xmath31 @xmath32 ) galaxy cluster at redshift of @xmath25 = 0.39 ( from fe  k line fitting ) .",
    "is also the most massive and the hottest new sz cluster detected by . our observations with the 2mt telescope ( see below )",
    "provide the first deep optical image , confirming it to be a very rich galaxy cluster .",
    "the x - ray and sz properties are summarised in table  [ table1 ] , taken from planck collaboration ( 2011c ) .",
    "we have reanalyzed the public domain  data providing clear evidence for significant morphological disturbances in the center , thus characterizing  as a dynamically perturbed , merging system ( figure  [ fig_1 ] ) .",
    "we observed   with the 2 m optical telescope of the iucaa girawali observatory ( igo ) in india , using the iucaa _ faint object spectrograph & camera ( ifosc)_. ifosc employs an eev 2k  x  2k ccd giving a field of view of about 10.5  x  10.5 arcminutes .",
    "observations were taken on 2011 february 3rd , 6th , 7th and 10th , in fair seeing ( average @xmath21 ) and dark sky conditions .",
    "the analysis was done in a standard way using iraf .",
    "the final , combined deep r - filter image has a total exposure time of 4hr ( 12@xmath331200 s ) , which shows a dense concentration of galaxies near the cluster center .",
    "lacking a good magnitude calibration of the ccd images , we used the supercosmos sky survey for photometric information @xcite .",
    "we obtained a plot of galaxy counts by including galaxies with eso r - magnitude @xmath3420.5 and counting in cells of 100  radius . at the centre a peak galaxy over density factor of @xmath210 was found , relative to the mean field galaxy density far away .",
    "thus , we independently confirm  to be a very rich and massive galaxy concentration ( see figure  [ fig_1 ] ) .",
    "a search for diffuse non - thermal radio emission in and around the new  esz clusters was carried out , using the tifr - gmrt sky survey ( tgss ) database at 150 mhz .",
    "a central radio - halo / relic source and a peripheral giant double - relic were thus identified towards .",
    "these are corroborated by the 1.4 ghz nrao vla sky survey images ( nvss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as described below .",
    "the 150 mhz image presented here was derived from the data of the ongoing tgss ( s.k .",
    "sirothia et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "we reanalyzed the tgss snapshots with robust = 5 weights ( aips++ software ) in order to enhance the sensitivity to extended emission .",
    "this map with a beam of 36.84  x 28.58   fwhm in 47.6position angle , has an rms noise of 36 mjy beam@xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ) .",
    "the 1.4 ghz map in figure  [ fig_3 ] is reproduced from the nvss .",
    "our key result is the discovery of a pair of giant ( @xmath351  mpc ) , non - thermal peripheral radio relics of an unprecedented scale ( projected separation @xmath24.4 mpc at z=0.39 ) in a merging galaxy cluster of extreme properties ( figure  [ fig_2 ] top row ) .",
    "such mpc - scale double - relics are rare and only nine cases have been reported . of these , the double radio relic associated with the well known merging cluster abell  3667 ( z = 0.0556 ) and having an overall size of 3.9  mpc is the largest known till now @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the present case ( ) is not only the first clear detection of diffuse non - thermal radio emission in a galaxy cluster detected solely through a blind sz search by , it is also the most distant ( @xmath25 = 0.39 ) giant double radio relic known , even surpassing the hitherto known case of the @xmath36 filamentary cluster zwcl  2341.1 + 0000 @xcite . in  the pair of mpc - scale , sharp `` arc '' like relics",
    "are seen to the north and south of the cluster , capping the opposite ends of the x - ray emitting hot icm and the central optical galaxy concentration ( figures  [ fig_1 ] and [ fig_2 ] top row ) .",
    "the two extended radio - relics are marked rn ( north relic ) and rs ( south relic ) , also shown with iso - contours , superposed on the optical images ( lower left and right panels in figure  [ fig_2 ] ) .",
    "another mpc - scale y - shaped filamentary radio feature is visible closer to the north of the cluster center , whose nature is presently unclear ( @xmath2r.a .",
    "@xmath37 , decl .",
    "@xmath38 ) , but which may well be another radio relic , as it has no obvious association with any galaxy .",
    "both this feature and the peripheral double relic are visible also in the lower resolution nvss image at 1.4 ghz ( figure .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ) , lending independent support to their being real . moreover , nvss image shows some diffuse radio emission near the cluster center , probably representing a cluster wide radio - halo ( figure  [ fig_3 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the poor resolution and the presence of several discrete radio sources in that region makes it difficult to unambiguously visualise the proposed halo .",
    "note that the strong point source marked `` s '' on nvss image ( 181 mjy peak ) lacks a tgss counterpart , implying a strongly inverted spectrum below @xmath21 ghz . on the other hand , the nature of the extended mpc - scale feature marked ` f ' remains unclear ; although seen in the tgss 150 mhz image ( figure  [ fig_2 ] ) , it is absent in the nvss 1.4 ghz map .",
    "this suggests that either it is a very steep spectrum radio - relic , possibly a southern counterpart to the inner relic , or merely a noise feature . to clarify this",
    "we have applied for much deeper gmrt imaging .",
    "integrated flux densities of the radio relics are ; 550 @xmath39 50 mjy ( rn ) and 780 @xmath39 50 mjy ( rs ) at 150 mhz ( gmrt ) , and 33 @xmath39 5 mjy ( rn ) and 25 @xmath39 5 mjy ( rs ) at 1400 mhz ( very large array , vla ) .",
    "thus , the radio spectral index @xmath40 between the two frequencies is extremely steep , i.e. , 1.26 for the relic rn and 1.54 for the relic rs .",
    "the corresponding value for the giant y - shaped relic candidate north of the cluster center is also very steep at @xmath411.20 .",
    "these very steep spectra support the interpretation of all these giant diffuse sources as being radio relics , an inference corroborated by the lack of obvious association with any prominent galaxy ( figure  [ fig_2 ] ) .",
    "we also point out that the radio emission from a foreground ( @xmath42=15.34 ) , emission - line galaxy 2masx  j11504002 - 2800582 at @xmath25 = 0.0605 @xcite is seen superposed on the western end of the relic rn .",
    "our reanalysis of the 10  ks exposure  archival data for  shows an extremely x - ray luminous cluster having prominent substructure within the central 1.5(@xmath2500 kpc ) core region ( figure  [ fig_1 ] ) .",
    "the brightest central elliptical galaxy ( eso r magnitude 17.56 ) at r.a .",
    "@xmath43 , dec .",
    "@xmath44 is located within a subcluster , which is clearly shifted to the south - east from the main x - ray peak by @xmath21.3  ( 400 kpc ) .",
    "the compression of the x - ray contours north - west of the main x - ray peak indicates ongoing gas motions , either due to gas `` sloshing '' following a merger , or motion of a merging subcluster unit .",
    "a detailed analysis of the x - ray data will be presented in j. bagchi et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the giant radio relics reported here in the cluster  are not only the first such detections for an sz cluster survey , but also this relic pair has the largest separation ( 4.4 mpc ) and redshift ( @xmath25 = 0.39 ) compared to any other giant double relic known . in  the projected distances from the x - ray center of the cluster are about 5  ( or 1.58 mpc ) for the northern relic and 9.5  ( or 3 mpc ) for the southern relic . the virial radius ( @xmath45 ) of cluster can be estimated by taking @xmath46@xmath47 and scaling from @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath47 = @xmath30@xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "this gives @xmath47@xmath502.3 mpc , using @xmath30 = 1541 kpc and the mean value of mass ratio ( @xmath511.40@xmath390.02 , obtained from the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile fit to nearby ( @xmath250.15 ) clusters @xcite .",
    "thus the separation from the cluster centre of the relics is about 1.3@xmath33@xmath47 for rs and about 0.7@xmath33@xmath47 for rn .",
    "the mechanism of electron acceleration at such extreme distances from the cluster center is little understood . according to a currently popular interpretation ,",
    "double - relics are the sites where cosmic - ray particles are accelerated in - situ to relativistic energies by diffusive first - order fermi acceleration , such that the resulting radio emission traces the outward expanding powerful shock fronts originating from a major cluster merger activity at the center @xcite .",
    "this scenario is strongly supported by the extremely high temperature and unrelaxed x - ray appearance of .",
    "a recent hydro - simulation of major mergers @xcite show that the emergent ellipsoidal shock front may expand well beyond the virial radius and the brightest parts of it are roughly tangential to the principal merger axis , thus resembling a pair of concave `` arcs '' , akin to those found in .",
    "as the shock front crosses the virial radius , it begins to interact with the intergalactic matter filaments , resulting in its fragmentation into segments .",
    "such predicted evolution of the peripheral shocks appears to be mirrored in both members of the relic pair , whose overall arc - shaped radio morphology exhibits one or two distinct emission gaps ( figure  [ fig_2 ] ) .",
    "thus , such giant radio relics can be a new probe of the large - scale cosmic structures ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "data confirm that the cluster  is exceptional in terms of its mass , temperature , and luminosity ( table  [ table1 ] ) , detected with high s / n by  @xcite .",
    "given the perturbed dynamical state of merging system , it is of interest to investigate its position on the well - known x - ray  sz scaling planes .",
    "as shown in @xcite , indeed  is a prominent outlier from both @xmath52@xmath53 and @xmath54@xmath52 mean scaling lines , which are obtained from the bias corrected local rexcess x - ray sample @xcite , and a sample of 62 nearby galaxy clusters detected by showing strong sz decrement @xcite .",
    "although due to the intrinsic scatter in these correlations , the deviation of  from these scaling laws is not more than 1@xmath55 , nevertheless it is noticeably underluminous in x - rays for its large mass , in common with other new extreme low luminosity , high mass , disturbed clusters that are being revealed by .",
    "synchrotron emission from the giant relic pair shows that magnetic fields of appreciable strength are present not only in the icm but also in the diffuse intergalactic medium beyond , i.e. , in the gas that will be shocked as it accretes onto collapsing structures  the precursors of virialized galaxy clusters .",
    "such magnetic fields are also required for providing the scattering centers for the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism . as it is not obvious how magnetic fields are amplified up to the requisite large values along the filaments , studies similar to the one reported here",
    "pose a new challenge to theoretical models .",
    "the detection of large scale diffusive shocks via synchrotron radio emission in the sparsely studied , rarefied intergalactic field around the cluster - outskirts , i.e. , beyond the virial radius ( @xmath56 @xmath47 ) , is a very significant result , and it provides a foretaste of science with the upcoming low frequency radio telescopes like lofar and lwa ( and ska at higher frequency ) , as an effective probe of the non - thermal processes in merging clusters and within the filamentary cosmic - web of the near and distant parts of the universe ( e.g. rudnick et al .",
