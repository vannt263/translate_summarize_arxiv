    "in the context of hadronic interactions , events with rapidity gaps are dominated by the exchange of a @xmath1-even color singlet state , called the pomeron . within perturbative qcd",
    "the pomeron is built by the exchange of two gluons at lowest order .",
    "while the pomeron has acquired a good standing , the status of its @xmath1-odd partner  the odderon  is less safe . although it is needed _",
    "e.g. _ to describe properly the different behaviors of @xmath2 and @xmath3 elastic cross sections @xcite , it still evades confirmation in the perturbative regime , where , again at lowest order , it can be described by the exchange of three gluons in the color singlet state .",
    "the main reason lies in its smaller exchange amplitude in comparison to the pomeron exchange such that in the cross section , obtained after squaring the sum of both amplitudes , the pomeron amplitude squared dominates . in this contribution",
    "we present results of our study @xcite of a charge asymmetry in the production of two pion pairs in photon - photon collisions where that pomeron squared part vanishes .",
    "this observable is thus linearly sensitive to the odderon contribution .    in the present analysis we deal with the hard pomeron and the hard odderon exchanges , _",
    "i.e. _ both treated within perturbative qcd .",
    "this approach can be confronted with a description of the pomeron - odderon interference based on soft , non - perturbative physics and developed in refs .",
    "the experimental observation of the p - o interference effects will thus shed a light on the important question which of the above mechanisms is more appropriate for the description of data .",
    "in a sample feynman diagram of the two gluon exchange process.,height=185 ]    figure  [ fig:1 ] shows a sample diagram of the process under consideration .",
    "we consider large @xmath4 energies such that the amplitude can be expressed in terms of two impact factors convoluted over the transverse momenta of the exchanged gluons .",
    "the impact factors are universal and consist of a perturbative part  describing the transition of a photon into a quark - antiquark pair  and a non - perturbative part , the two pion generalized distribution amplitude ( gda ) parametrizing the quark - antiquark hadronization into the pion pair .",
    "these gdas  [ 4 - 8 ] which are functions of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath5 of the quark , of the angle @xmath6 ( in the rest frame of the pion pair ) and of the invariant mass @xmath7 of the pion system are the only but nevertheless essential phenomenological inputs . in principle , they have to be extracted from experiments but this is a very challenging task and has not been done so far .",
    "however , after an expansion in gegenbauer polynomials @xmath8 and in legendre polynomials @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 ) @xcite , it is believed that only the first terms give a significant contribution : @xmath11,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 can be identified with the electromagnetic pion form factor @xmath13 . for the @xmath14 component",
    "we use different models .",
    "the first model follows ref .",
    "@xcite and expresses the functions @xmath15 in terms of the breit - wigner amplitudes of the according resonances .",
    "a second model has been elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite and interprets the functions @xmath15 as corresponding omns functions for @xmath16 and @xmath17waves constructed by dispersion relations from the phase shifts of the elastic pion scattering .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the actual phases of the gda might be closer to the phases @xmath18 of the corresponding @xmath19 matrix elements @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the inelasticity factor . the third model for the @xmath14 component of the gda takes this into account by using the technique of model 2 with these phases @xmath18 of the @xmath19 matrix elements .",
    "indeed , measurements at hermes @xcite do not observe a resonance effect at the @xmath22-mass , but concerning the @xmath23 both phases ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) are compatible with data @xcite . having this in mind , we consider also a fourth model  a mixed description with the @xmath22 contribution from model 3 and the @xmath23 contribution from model 2 .",
    "the key to obtain an observable which linearly depends on the odderon amplitude is the orthogonality of the @xmath1-even gda ( entering the odderon process ) and the @xmath1-odd one ( entering the pomeron process ) in the space of legendre polynomials in @xmath26 . due to an additional multiplication by @xmath26 before the angular integration",
    "only the interference term survives .",
    "we have to do this for both the pion pairs .",
    "moreover we integrate over the invariant mass of one of the pion pairs to reduce the complexity of our observable .",
    "finally , we define the charge asymmetry in the following way : @xmath27}{\\int_{m_{\\rm min}^2}^{m_{\\rm max}^2 } dm_{2\\pi}'^2\\int_{-1}^1d\\cos\\theta\\int_{-1}^1d\\cos\\theta'\\,\\left[\\left|\\mathcal{m}_{\\mathbb{p}}\\right|^2+\\left|\\mathcal{m}_{\\mathbb{o}}+\\mathcal{m}_{\\gamma}\\right|^2\\right ] } .",
    "\\label{eq : ahat}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    an analytic calculation of the odderon matrix element would demand the notion of analytic results for two - loop box diagrams , whose off - shellness for all external legs is different . with the techniques currently available such a calculation is not straightforward and we chose to rely on a numerical evaluation by monte carlo methods . in particular we make use of a modified version of vegas as it is provided by the cuba library @xcite .",
    "the result for @xmath28 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymplot1 ] where we took two different choices for the integrated region of the invariant mass of the two pions system . since our framework",
    "is only justified for @xmath29 , ( in fact strictly speaking , one even needs @xmath30 ) , we keep @xmath7 below 1gev .     at @xmath31 for model 1 ( solid ) , 2 ( dashed ) , 3 ( dotted ) , and 4 ( dash - dotted )  model 3 and 4 are nearly on top of each other .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    to answer the question whether it is possible to measure this asymmetry , we need to discuss the two main issues .",
    "first , one has to convolute the @xmath4 cross section obtained by our calculations with the effective photon flux at a collider , _",
    "e.g. _ the lhc . as we discuss in ref .",
    "@xcite in detail , the most recent review on this topic @xcite presents an overview of photon fluxes for different colliding hadrons which is flawed by an inconsistency in the underlying hadron - hadron luminosities .",
    "therefore , we show a consistent comparison for the design luminosities of different colliding particles in fig .  [",
    "fig : lumi ] . for the proton case",
    "we display the different luminosities based on either the proton form factor @xcite or on the asymptotic formula for large nuclei  both leading to sizeable rates at the lhc as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] .",
    "luminosities for the collision of p - p based on ref .",
    "@xcite ( dash - dotted ) and ref .",
    "@xcite ( dashed ) .",
    "the results using the parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite for ions are given by solid lines for p - p , @xmath36-@xmath36 , @xmath37-@xmath37 , @xmath38-@xmath38 , @xmath39-@xmath39 , @xmath40-@xmath40 from top to bottom .",
    "for ions we used the average luminosities as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , for proton we used @xmath41 . for comparison",
    "also effective @xmath4 luminosities at the ilc are given for @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( both as dotted lines).,width=453 ]     in dependence on the lower cut @xmath44 given in ` events per month ' in case of ions , and ` events per six months ' in case of protons which in both cases correspond to one year of running of lhc .",
    "the solid line displays the result for p - p collision using ref .",
    "@xcite , the dashed - dotted that for protons treated as heavy ions , the dashed one that for ar - ar collisions , and the dotted line that for pb - pb collisions .",
    "also the much smaller rates coming from the odderon exchange are shown ( with the same dashing).,width=377 ]    the second important issue is the background .",
    "in contrast to many other processes studied in ultraperipheral collisions , pions are produced by pure qcd processes as well .",
    "although heavy ions would offer the possibility to easily trigger on ultraperipheral collisions by detecting neutrons from giant dipole resonances in the zero degree calorimeters , the rates that can be read off from fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] are rather low",
    ". regarding the cross section , the p - p mode is highly preferred , but lacks the possibility of easy triggering .",
    "still , one could rely on the fact that ultraperipheral processes are strongly peaked at low @xmath45 , contrarily to the flatter depence of the pomeron induced ones @xcite .",
    "we have shown that in production of pion pairs in @xmath4 collisions the charge asymmetry which is linearly dependent on the odderon amplitude is sizeable and hence offers the possibility to observe the perturbative odderon in ultraperipheral collisions at the lhc .",
    "the concrete values are gda - model dependent .",
    "hermes measurements of two pion electroproduction @xcite disfavor models with a strong @xmath22 coupling to the @xmath46 state but to our minds higher statistics data , which may come from a jlab experiment at 12gev , are needed before a definite conclusion .",
