    "after the release of the bright source list by the fermi collaboration @xcite , milagro reported the association of mgro j1908 + 06 to the lat pulsar 0fgl j1907.5 + 0602 ( later renamed psr j1907 + 0602 ) , pulsating with a period of 106.6 ms @xcite .",

    "the authors suggest that the discrepancy can be simply due to a statistical fluctuation , or to the fact that milagro , given its relatively poor angular resolution , integrates the signal over a larger solid angle compared with h.e.s.s . , and likely detects more of the diffuse lateral tails of the extended source .    in this work we report on the observation of mgro j1908 + 06 with the argo - ybj detector performed during the years 2007 - 2011 .",
    "after a brief description of the detector and a detailed presentation of the data analysis technique , we report our results concerning the extension and the energy spectrum of the source .",

    "in addition , in order to extend the dynamical range up to pev energies , each rpc is equipped with two large size pads ( 139 @xmath4 123 cm@xmath25 ) to collect the total charge developed by the particle hitting the detector @xcite .",

    "the time of each fired pad in a window of 2 @xmath29sec around the trigger time and its location are recorded and used to reconstruct the position of the shower core and the arrival direction of the primary particle . in order to perform the time calibration of the 18360 pads ,",

    "changing the time , the fake events maintain the same declination of the original event , but have a different right ascension . with these events a new sky map ( background map )",

    "however these latter have been accurately studied , giving a global error on the flux less than 30@xmath19 . indeed , the spectrum of the crab nebula obtained by argo - ybj results to be in good agreement with the cherenkov detectors measurements @xcite .",
    "the extension of the source should not give such an additional systematic error to explain the observed difference .",
    "on the other hand , a similar discrepancy is found in the observation of the extended source mgro j2031 + 41 , located in the cygnus region , for which argo - ybj @xcite and milagro @xcite report a flux significantly larger than that measured by the cherenkov telescopes magic and hegra .    in principle",
    ", one can not exclude the possibility of a flux variation as the origin of the observed disagreement among the detectors .",
    "milagro , h.e.s.s . and",
    "argo - ybj data have been recorded in different periods .",
    "milagro integrates over seven years ( july 2000 - november 2007 ) while the total h.e.s.s .",
    "data set only amounts to 27 hours of sparse observations during 2005 - 2007 , before the argo - ybj measurement .",
    "however , a possible flux variation seems unlikely , since the average fluxes measured by milagro and argo - ybj in two contiguous periods covering a total time of 11 years , are consistent .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that if mgro j1908 + 06 is the pulsar wind nebula associated to psr j1907 + 0602 , the gamma ray emission originates from a region whose size has been estimated to be @xmath2240 pc @xcite , implying that the variation time scale can not be less than @xmath0130 years , unless relativistic beaming effects are present .    in conclusion , mgro j1908 + 06",
    "is observed by argo - ybj as a stable extended source , likely the tev nebula of psr j1907 + 0602 , with a flux at 1 tev @xmath067@xmath19 that of the crab nebula . assuming a distance of 3.2 kpc , the integrated luminosity above 1 tev is @xmath01.8 times that of the crab nebula , making mgro j1908 + 06 one of the most luminous galactic gamma ray sources at tev energies .",
