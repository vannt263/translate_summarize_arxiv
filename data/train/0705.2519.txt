    "coalescing black hole binaries are among the most promising gravitational wave ( gw ) sources for the currently operating ground - based detectors like geo / ligo / virgo .",
    "the most useful part of the waveform for detection comes from the most relativistic part of the dynamics : the last few cycles of the adiabatic inspiral , the plunge and the merger .",
    "since ligo is currently taking data at the expected sensitivity , it becomes urgent to have accurate template waveforms for detection . in the most general",
    ", spinning case , these waveforms are complicated functions of the initial masses @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the spins @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the two constituent black holes . due to the multi - dimensionality of the parameter space , it seems impossible for state - of - the - art numerical simulations to densely sample this parameter space .",
    "this motivates a renewed effort for developing _ analytical _ methods towards computing the huge banks of accurate template waveforms needed to densely cover the parameter space .",
    "as far as we know , the first estimate of the complete waveform ( covering inspiral , plunge , merger and ring - down ) of a coalescing , non - spinning black hole binary was made in 2000  @xcite , on the basis of a new analytical approach to the general relativistic two - body dynamics , the _ effective - one - body _ ( eob ) approach  @xcite . at the time , no reliable numerical simulations of coalescing black hole binaries were yet available .",
    "this eob - based estimate used a 2.5 post - newtonian ( pn ) accurate description of the dynamics ( the only one available at the time ) and a quadrupole - type `` restricted waveform '' approximation for the waveform down to a `` matching radius '' @xmath5 where the two - black - hole system was replaced by a unique , ringing kerr black hole .",
    "it was also argued that the matching radius @xmath5 could be taken as the eob - deformed `` light ring '' , @xmath6 , which was noticed to be very close to the point where the orbital frequency reached a maximum . as a first approximation ,",
    "a complete waveform was computed by matching , at @xmath7 , the inspiral - plus - plunge waveform to a ring - down waveform made of the least damped quasi - normal mode ( qnm ) of a kerr black hole of mass and angular momentum corresponding to those of the relative dynamics at @xmath5 . in other words ,",
    "@xcite was making the assumption that the _ merger phase _ of the two black holes was very brief , and did not correspond to any especially strong gw emission feature , but would simply smoothly connect the plunge behavior to the ringdown one .    in 2001 , a combination of ( rather short ) full numerical simulations with a `` close - limit '' approximation  @xcite led to the first numerical estimate of the waveform emitted by the plunge from the isco , followed by merger and ringdown  @xcite .",
    "very recent breakthroughs in numerical relativity simulations have finally made accessible a much more precise knowledge of the waveforms generated by the merger of two black holes of comparable masses @xmath1 and @xmath2 , possibly with spin .",
    "these results have been obtained by different groups with different approaches , and exhibit convincing internal convergence and a nice mutual consistency  @xcite .",
    "the availability of reliable numerical results makes it urgent to compare analytical and numerical approaches for ( i ) understanding in depth the physics that is involved in the process and thus ( ii ) completing the currently available analytical knowledge of the problem with the `` missing '' non - perturbative physics provided by numerical relativity simulations .",
    "several different ways of combining the knowledge acquired through analytical and numerical methods have been recently explored , such as the use of `` hybrid '' signals made by stitching together an inspiral pn - type waveform to a nr merger one  @xcite , or the study of whether some simple multiparameter ( bcv - type  @xcite ) analytical waveform can have sufficiently large overlaps with hybrid signals .",
    "our aim here is different .",
    "we wish , ultimately , to construct _ high - accuracy _ purely analytical template waveforms , depending only on physical parameters , and covering the full process : inspiral , plunge , merger and ringdown ; by high - accuracy we mean that their phasing ( and possibly their amplitude too ) would be very close to the true phasing , uniformly , to a few percent .",
    "let us recall that it is convenient ( following the terminology of ref .",
    "@xcite ) to distinguish _ effectual _ and _ faithful _ templates : effectual templates are defined by the property of having sufficiently large ( say @xmath8 ) overlaps with the expected `` real '' signals , _",
    "after maximization over all ( kinematical , dynamical , and possibly fudge ) parameters_. effectual templates maybe useful tools for _ detecting _ real signals , but they might lead to large biases in the measurement of the physical parameters of the system .",
    "by contrast , faithful templates are defined by the property of having not only large overlaps , but also of being so `` close '' to the real signals that the overlap between the template and the real signal is maximized for values of the parameters which are very close to the real ones ( `` small biases '' ) .",
    "recent `` first order '' comparisons between full numerical relativity waveforms and eob - based waveforms have already established that eob waveforms can be _ effectual _",
    "( overlaps @xmath8 ) over the full mass range of interest for geo / ligo / virgo , say a total mass @xmath9 between @xmath10 and @xmath11 solar masses  @xcite . our main aim will be to prove that eob - based waveforms can also be _",
    "faithful _ over the full mass range of interest .",
    "our methodology for achieving this aim is to improve the current waveform implementations  @xcite of the eob approach  @xcite by understanding , element by element , the physics behind each feature of the waveform , and by comparing eob - based waveforms with `` exact '' waveforms obtained by numerical relativity approaches . in the present paper",
    ", we shall tap the information contained in small - mass - ratio waveforms . [ a preliminary version of our results",
    "was reported in  @xcite .",
    "] indeed , the limiting case @xmath12 constitutes a `` clean laboratory '' where many subtle physical issues can be studied in detail ( and by means of rather light numerical tools ) , without the complications entailed by the current three - dimensional numerical simulations ( residual eccentricity , numerical noise , ... ) .",
    "we rely on the recently developed numerical waveform computations  la regge - wheeler - zerilli in ref .",
    "note that we consider non - spinning inspiralling systems circularized by radiation reaction .",
    "the various improvements in the eob waveform construction that we shall address here concern : ( i ) an improved analytical expression for the ( @xmath13 ) waveform which includes a resummation of the tail effects , and a 3pn - accurate `` non - linear '' amplitude correction , ( ii ) the inclusion of non - quasi - circular corrections to the waveform , ( iii ) a comparative study of the two radiation reaction expressions during the plunge that have been proposed ( @xcite versus @xcite ) , ( iv ) the inclusion of non - quasi - circular corrections to radiation reaction , and ( v ) an improved treatment of the matching between the plunge and ring - down waveforms ( which takes into account a new understanding of the importance of the number of qnms , the sign of their frequencies , and the length of the interval on which the matching is done ) .",
    "we shall show that the resulting improved implementation of the eob approach yields very faithful waveforms whose amplitude and phase agree remarkably well with the `` exact '' ones : in particular , the eob phasing differs from the `` exact '' one by less than @xmath0 of a cycle over the whole process .",

    "in this section we recall the eob non - perturbative construction of the two - body dynamics including a radiation reaction force and then specify it to the small mass limit .",
    "the eob approach to the general relativistic two - body dynamics is a _ non - perturbatively resummed _",
    "analytic technique which has been developed in refs .",
    "this technique uses , as basic input , the results of pn theory , such as : ( i ) pn - expanded equations of motion for two point - like bodies , ( ii ) pn - expanded radiative multipole moments , and ( iii ) pn - expanded energy and angular momentum fluxes at infinity . for the moment ,",
    "the most accurate such results are the 3pn conservative dynamics  @xcite , and the 3.5pn energy flux  @xcite .",
    "then the eob approach `` packages '' this pn - expanded information in special _ resummed _ forms which extend the validity of the pn results beyond the expected weak - field - slow - velocity regime into ( part of ) the strong - field - fast - motion regime . at the practical level",
    ", the result of this `` packaging '' is that the complicated pn - expanded relative dynamics , ( in the center of mass frame ) of a binary system of masses @xmath1 and @xmath2 is mapped into the simpler ( essentially geodesic ) dynamics of a particle of mass @xmath14 moving in some effective background geometry ( in schwarzschild gauge ) @xmath15 here and below we work with dimensionless reduced variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 ; @xmath19 are polar coordinates in the _ effective _ problem that describe the relative motion .",

    "the dotted line refers to the mechanical losses with non - quasi - circular corrections .",
    "see text for discussion.,width=80,height=75 ]    the physics behind the differences between the `` analytical '' and `` exact '' angular momentum fluxes ( as well as between the two analytical ones ) lies in the presence of _ non - quasi - circular _ ( nqc ) effects during the plunge phase . during the adiabatic inspiral one takes advantage of the quasi - circularity ( qc ) of the motion to operate _ two separate simplifications _ : ( a ) one neglects the terms proportional to @xmath112 , and ( b ) one neglects the terms proportional to @xmath113 , which , by using the equations of motion , give ( modulo the square of @xmath112 ) terms proportional either to @xmath114 ( `` virial combination '' ) , or to @xmath115 ( `` kepler combination '' minus 1 ) . during the plunge , both simplifications become less and less valid so that one should correct any qc - derived expression by terms proportional to powers of the two basic dimensionless nqc ratios @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",

    "as we expect ( from the usual quadrupole formula , as well as from the well - known fact that orbital eccentricity tends to _ increase _ the flux of angular momentum ) that the nqc factor in the radiation reaction should be _ larger than one _ , we conclude that the `` improved '' radiation reaction expression @xmath56 proposed in  @xcite is a physically more appealing starting point for applying such a nqc correcting factor .",
    "in addition , as , pragmatically speaking , the two types of terms parametrized by @xmath120 and @xmath121 in eq .",
    "( [ fnqc ] ) above behave in a roughly similar way during the plunge ( they are both positive and they both increase ) , we can try , in first approximation , to use only one of them , say the first one parametrized by @xmath120 .    in fig .",

    "we see how such a simple ( and physically reasonable , because larger than one ) nqc factor suffices to have a good agreement between a `` nqc - corrected analytical radiation reaction '' and the `` exact '' angular momentum flux @xmath93 up until the light - ring , that is crossed at @xmath125 .",
    "this gives our first instance of the aim of the present paper : to better understand ( by comparing to `` exact '' numerical results ) the `` missing physics '' in some first - order analytical expression , and then to use this improved understanding to further improve the starting analytical expression .",

    "this means that during all the plunge ( including at the end , when @xmath169 reaches its maximum value ) , we can think ( in first order ) in terms of a _ near - zone _ approximation , where we can neglect @xmath170 and compute the asymptotic waveform by convolving the source by a solution of the static , radial regge - wheeler - zerilli equation .",
    "one can check that this leads essentially to the usual ( schwarzschild - coordinate ) quadrupole formula for the waveform . in this approximation",
    "there is strictly no excitation of the qnm modes by the adiabatically varying source .",
    "one therefore concludes ( following the line of reasoning of ref .",
    "@xcite where it was explained how a certain type of oscillating integral which exponentially vanishes in the adiabatic approximation acquired a non - zero value due to a localized non - adiabatic behavior of the integrand ) that the qnm modes will be excited essentially only around the maximum of the exciting frequency @xmath161 , because this is the moment when the source excitation is _ non - adiabatic_. looking now at the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , we see the trajectory of the exciting frequency on the _ positive _ real axis , from zero up to the maximum @xmath171 .",
    "the black dots in the complex frequency plane represent the first qnm modes of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "one understands intuitively ( and this can be put in equations similar to those derived in  @xcite ) that the amount of excitation , by the non - adiabatic behavior of the excitation frequency near its maximum , of the various qnm modes will primarily depend on their `` distance '' to the critical ( real ) exciting frequency @xmath172 .",
    "this reasoning indicates that the qnm modes which will be primarily excited are the first few _ positive frequency _ modes , i.e. those appearing on the right part of the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] . summarizing in slightly different physical terms",
    ", we can think of the black hole as a resonating object having the resonance spectrum showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] . when the source varies adiabatically , so that it corresponds to a nearly pure frequency @xmath173 which is much _ smaller _ than any of the resonance frequencies it excites only negligibly the resonance modes .",
    "however , when the source varies non - adiabatically ( near its maximum frequency ) , its fourier transform contains a halo of frequencies ( due to non - adiabaticity ) centered around the instantaneous frequency , and this halo can now `` extend the reach '' of @xmath174 and thereby excite the black hole resonances which lie within this `` halo '' ( i.e. the first few qnm modes whose frequency has the _ same sign _ as @xmath174 ) .",
    "let us now turn to the construction of complete eob - type gravitational waveforms obtained by _ matching _ an analytical _ inspiral - plus - plunge _ waveform to a _ ring - down _ one .",
    "for the reasons explained above , the crossing of the light ring ( actually the non adiabatic behavior around the moment when @xmath169 reaches it maximum ) corresponds to an abrupt triggering of the qnms of the black hole ( this was realized long ago  @xcite for the case of the radial plunge ) .",
    "the eob approach takes into account this abrupt change in the underlying physics by an abrupt change in the analytical description of the system : before the crossing of the light ring one describes the binary system as two point masses with eob relative dynamics , while after the crossing one replaces the binary system by a single distorted black hole ( as in the `` close - limit '' approximation of colliding black holes  @xcite ) . as we were mentioning in the introduction , at the practical level this dual description implies that one should _ match _ together ( around the light ring ) a plunge waveform obtained with a _ quadrupole - type _ formula to a superposition of black hole qnms .",
    "this general philosophy has already been implemented , with increasing sophistication in refs . @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to further improve the implementation of the eob approach by studying in detail each one of its building blocks , and by comparing the resulting analytical waveform to the _ exact _ numerical waveforms discussed above .",
    "we start by introducing here a new , improved eob - type inspiral - plus - plunge waveform that goes beyond previous work in two directions : ( i ) it includes higher post - newtonian ( pn ) effects which are _ resummed _ in a novel way ( factorized formulation , exact resummation of tail effects , 3pn - resummed non - linear pn effects ) , and ( ii ) it includes non - quasi - circular ( nqc ) corrections that are expected to be relevant below the lso .",
    "details of our construction will be explained separately @xcite .",
    "up until the light ring @xmath175 ) , we use a @xmath176 gravitational waveform defined by means of the following eob - type improved quadrupole formula @xmath177 here , @xmath178 includes four types of pn effects , while the braces represent nqc corrections . the standard quadrupole formula ( for a point - particle source in quasi - circular motion )",
    "corresponds to the case where @xmath179 and @xmath180 ( see e.g.  @xcite ; the numerical coefficient @xmath181 corresponds to our using the zerilli - moncrief even quantity @xmath135 ) .    the nqc factor added above ( within braces ) is more general than the general _ time - even _ nqc factor considered in ( [ fnqc ] ) because we describe here non time - even nqc effects ( as can easily be seen on the usual quadrupole formula written with two time - derivatives ) .",
    "the numerical coefficients @xmath120 and @xmath182 thus parametrize non - quasi - circular corrections to the modulus and to the phase of the wave .",
    "they will be fixed below by comparison to the `` exact '' zerilli - moncrief waveform .",
    "the novel @xmath178 pn - improving factor is given as the product of four terms @xmath183 this factorization of pn effects is , in itself , a new way of partially resumming pn effects ( by contrast to usual representations of pn effects which mix the expansion of the four separate factors above ) .",
    "the first factor is the `` conserved '' relativistic energy of the ( effective ) moving source .",
    "the second factor @xmath184 is the particularization to @xmath133 of a function @xmath185 ( with @xmath186 ) that represents a `` tail '' correction , namely the contribution due to backscattering of ( multipolar ) waves off the background curvature .",
    "this factor is the exact resummation of an infinite number of `` leading logarithms '' , and is derived , similarly to the work in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using coulomb wave functions .",
    "it is explicitly given by @xmath187 where we shall take @xmath188 .",
    "@xmath189 is an additional phase correction , with @xmath190 to lowest pn order .",
    "the final factor @xmath191 represents the remaining ( essentially non - linear ) pn effects . using ref .  @xcite it can be computed in the test - mass limit , during the inspiral , as a taylor expansion in the pn - ordering parameter @xmath192 . at 3pn",
    "this series is known to higher pn orders .",
    "we truncate it here to the 3pn level which is the highest order at which we could ( and did ) derive it in the comparable - mass case .",

    "when deriving the factor @xmath191 during the inspiral phase , the argument @xmath195 that it depends upon is `` degenerate '' in the sense that it can be expressed in various ways in terms of the dynamical variables of the system , namely : @xmath196 .",
    "however , these various expressions start differing from each other during the plunge .",
    "this opens the issue of choosing the `` best '' dynamical expression for the pn - ordering argument @xmath195 during the plunge , in the sense of giving the best approximation to the `` exact '' waveform ( minimizing the need for nqc corrections ) .",
    "we have found that choosing @xmath197 ( the newtonian gravitational potential ) yields good results , and this is the choice we shall make here .",
    "we postpone to a further publication a thorough analysis of the effect of different @xmath195 arguments , as well as the contrast between the pad - resummed ( that we shall use here ) and taylor - expanded versions of @xmath191 .",
    "after the crossing of the light ring , the eob approach consists in replacing the two - body system by a single distorted black hole . at the level of waveforms , this means that one should _",
    "match _ , around the light ring , the plunge waveform eq .",
    "( [ eq : psieob_inspiral ] ) to a _ ring - down _ one made of a superposition of ( @xmath198 ) black hole qnms , say @xmath199 where @xmath200 are the positive / negative complex qnm frequencies and @xmath201 are the corresponding amplitudes . here , @xmath202 and @xmath203 indicate the damping time and the oscillation frequency of each mode respectively , and @xmath204 labels the overtone number ( @xmath205 denoting the fundamental mode ) .",
    "in this paper we propose an improved treatment of the definition of the ring - down waveform eq .",
    "( [ eq : psieob_ringdown ] ) , as well as of the matching to the plunge waveform eq .",
    "( [ eq : psieob_inspiral ] ) .",
    "first , in view of both the numerical results and the theoretical arguments presented above , we know that the contribution of the positive - frequency modes to the waveform is much larger than that of the negative - frequency ones . therefore , we can set @xmath206 in first approximation . as a result",
    ", the instantaneous gravitational wave frequency @xmath207 of our `` matched '' ring - down waveform will grow until it reaches a `` flat '' saturation region , _ without oscillations_. though this is qualitatively slightly different from the behavior of the exact instantaneous frequency ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : waveforms ] ) we will see that this gives an excellent approximation to the phasing ( and actually a better one that if one matches to both positive and negative modes in a democratic way ) .",
    "our problem is thus to determine the coefficients @xmath208 from the knowledge of @xmath209 for @xmath210 .",
    "here again we introduce some significant improvements on previous implementations of the eob philosophy , based on the knowledge acquired from detailed comparisons with our `` exact '' small - mass - ratio numerical results .",
    "a trivial improvement will consist in using a larger number @xmath211 of qnms ( including the fundamental mode ) than previous work . instead of @xmath212  @xcite , @xmath213  @xcite , or @xmath214",
    "@xcite , we shall use here @xmath215 ( positive - frequency ) quasi - normal modes ( including the fundamental mode )  @xcite .",
    "our studies showed that @xmath215 gives a significantly better fit than @xmath216 or less , and that larger values of @xmath211 yield only a rather marginal improvement .",
    "first of all @xmath209 , eq .  ( [ eq : psieob_inspiral ] ) , has two free parameters @xmath120 and @xmath182 that should be specified so to minimize the difference with the real signal .",
    "the presence of two separate nqc real parameters is useful because the waveform is a complex number , and we wish to best fit both its modulus and its phase nqc factor in braces used above , is to use instead a factorized complex nqc waveform correction of the form , @xmath217 , in which @xmath121 affects only the modulus , and @xmath218 only the phase .",
    "the ( approximate ) analytic constraint on the modulus discussed below then becomes simply @xmath219 . ] .",
    "the _ modulus _ of the numerical waveform reaches a maximum at the ( shifted ) retarded time @xmath220 ( i.e. just before the maximum of the orbital frequency , or the crossing of the light ring , which both occur near @xmath221 ) .",
    "we can then constrain the nqc parameters @xmath120 and @xmath182 so as to ensure that the maximum of the modulus of the analytical waveform ( [ eq : psieob_inspiral ] ) sits on top of that of the exact modulus .",
    "actually , we can even do this _ analytically_. using the quasi - geodesic approximate description of the plunge , and imposing that the modulus of the analytical waveform ( [ eq : psieob_inspiral ] ) is maximum at the light - ring gives , in first nqc approximation , the constraint @xmath222 .",
    "we then get a second constraint ( mainly on the coefficient @xmath182 ) by requiring that the _ slope _ of the instantaneous analytical frequency @xmath223 be as close as possible to the exact one @xmath224 around the light ring .",
    "the two above requirements fix the values of the nqc parameters to be : @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "it is remarkable that these two numerical values ( numerically determined , by trial and error , as best eye - fitting values ) do satisfy quite accurately the ( first - order ) analytically determined constraint mentioned above : indeed , @xmath227 .",
    "this shows the power of the eob approach for building a purely analytical _ self - consistent _ matched waveform , even in absence of knowledge about the exact signal .",
    "the last and most crucial new ingredient introduced here consists in _ matching _ the plunge and ring - down waveforms on a _",
    "finite time interval _",
    "$ ] , instead of simply imposing the continuity of the two functions , and a certain number of their derivatives , at one moment @xmath229 ( as done in  @xcite ) .",
    "we found that this matching on a finite interval ( chosen in the immediate vicinity of light - ring crossing ) was quite effective for accurately reproducing the smooth rise of the instantaneous gw frequency during the whole transition .",
    "more precisely , a good choice for the matching interval @xmath230 $ ] consists in putting its center @xmath231 at the _ maximum of the modulus _ of @xmath232 , i.e. at @xmath233 , and choosing his full length @xmath234 as @xmath235 .",
    "the matching on the interval @xmath230 $ ] is most easily done by discretizing this matching interval into @xmath211 ( here @xmath215 ) equally spaced points , @xmath236 $ ] ( with @xmath237 and @xmath238 ) and requiring that the two complex functions ( [ eq : psieob_inspiral ] ) and ( [ eq : psieob_ringdown ] ) coincide at these @xmath211 points .",
    "this gives @xmath211 ( linear ) complex equations for the @xmath211 complex unknowns @xmath208 .",
    "in other words we are using a ` matching comb ' .",
    "finally , we define our complete eob matched waveform ( from inspiral to ring - down ) as @xmath239 where @xmath240 denotes heaviside s step function transition between the two waveforms one could replace @xmath241 by one of laurent schwartz s well - known smoothed step functions ( or `` partitions of unity '' ) @xmath242 .    the left panel of fig .",

    "note , however , that there remains some flexibility in the numerical values of these parameters .",
    "we leave to future work a detailed discussion of this issue .",
    "let us only note here that the `` good choices '' of these parameters ( minimizing the maximum ( absolute ) dephasing  ) are correlated , and that the values we have used above are near optimal in the following sense : if , for example , we keep fixed the matching comb parameters @xmath231 and @xmath263 , and vary @xmath120 in the interval @xmath264 $ ] , the best possible complementary values of @xmath182 that we could find ( varying in the interval @xmath265 $ ] ) were found to lead to minimax dephasings larger than @xmath266 , but remaining smaller than @xmath267 .",
    "we also explored the sensitivity to the choice of the matching comb .",
    "for instance , if we keep fixed only the center of the matching interval at @xmath268 , and increase @xmath269 by a factor 2 ( to @xmath270 ) and then look for the best possible values of the parameters @xmath120 and @xmath182 , we find that the minimax dephasings are increased from @xmath266 to about @xmath271 . on the other hand , if ( still keeping fixed @xmath231 ) we decrease @xmath269 to @xmath272 , and then look for the best possible @xmath120 and @xmath182 , we find that the minimax dephasings are increased from @xmath266 to @xmath273 .",
    "similar sensitivities are also reached if we keep fixed @xmath269 ( to the near optimal value @xmath274 ) , but move the center of the interval : for example , @xmath275 leads to a minimax of @xmath271 , while @xmath276 gives @xmath277 , so that we obtain correspondingly less accurate decriptions of the waveform .    on the other hand , as we shall discuss in detail in a separate publication , even much simplified versions of our matching technique can lead to rather impressively good results , notably for the phasing . to quote one particularly simple example , the standard quadrupole formula in the quasi - circular approximation ( in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ eq : psieob_inspiral ] ) with @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath215 ) , still gives a quite tiny dephasing , @xmath278 , though the evolution of the modulus is less well reproduced .",
    "comparison between the moduli and the phases of two waveforms : the `` exact '' numerical one , and a non - optimized analytic one based on a coarser implementation of the eob philosophy ( no pn corrections , no explicit nqc corrections , @xmath214 qnms , nearly instantaneous matching at the light ring ) .",
    "see text for details.,width=75,height=70 ]    finally , we pedagogically illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , in a `` contrasting '' manner , the effect of the various improvements introduced above by showing how the waveform comparison of fig .

    "[ indeed , the matching of the two waveforms and their derivatives at a sharply defined moment is equivalent to considering the @xmath283 limit of our comb - matching technique ] . by contrasting fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] with the right panel of fig .",

    "<S> we address the problem of constructing high - accuracy , faithful analytic waveforms describing the gravitational wave signal emitted by inspiralling and coalescing binary black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we work within the effective - one - body ( eob ) framework and propose a methodology for improving the current ( waveform ) implementations of this framework based on understanding , element by element , the physics behind each feature of the waveform , and on systematically comparing various eob - based waveforms with `` exact '' waveforms obtained by numerical relativity approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the present paper focuses on small - mass - ratio non - spinning binary systems , which can be conveniently studied by regge - wheeler - zerilli - type methods . </S>",
    "<S> our results include : ( i ) a resummed , 3pn - accurate description of the inspiral waveform , ( ii ) a better description of radiation reaction during the plunge , ( iii ) a refined analytic expression for the plunge waveform , ( iv ) an improved treatment of the matching between the plunge and ring - down waveforms . </S>",
    "<S> this improved implementation of the eob approach allows us to construct complete analytic waveforms which exhibit a remarkable agreement with the `` exact '' ones in modulus , frequency and phase . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the analytic and numerical waveforms stay in phase , during the whole process , within @xmath0 of a cycle . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the extension of our methodology to the comparable - mass case will be able to generate comparably accurate analytic waveforms of direct use for the ground - based network of interferometric detectors of gravitational waves . </S>"
