    "this work aims at testing the suggestion of @xcite that stellar rotation is faster at lower metallicity by direct measurements , especially in the lmc and smc , on stars with @xmath1 , i.e. spectral types b0-b6 or masses from @xmath3 to 14 m@xmath4 .",
    "this work is complementary to that of @xcite , which deals with slightly more massive stars .",
    "the results are shown on fig .  1 and commented in the caption .",
    "there is an excess of slow rotators in the galaxy relative to the mcs , but the @xmath0 distributions of the lmc and the smc are surprisingly similar .",
    "distributions for galactic stars in the field ( dotted line ) , for members of the h & @xmath2 per clusters ( dash - dot ) and for stars in the lmc ( short dash ) and in the smc ( solid line ) .",
    "the giraffe spectrograph , attached to the ut2 telescope ( vlt ) and used in the l2 setup ( @xmath5 , @xmath6   ) , was used on 3 fields in the lmc ( centered on [ @xmath705:31:40,@xmath8 - 66:59:48 ] , on [ 05:30:40 , -67:17:12 ] and on [ 05:03:48 , -69:00:36 ] ) and 2 fields in the smc ( centered on [ 00:56:12 , -72:29:00 ] and on [ 00:49:26 , -73:12:07 ] ) .",
    "we fitted synthetic spectra to observed ones in the range @xmath9     with the technique described by @xcite using an average @xmath10 relation for the main sequence and assuming @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 values were then transformed to the scale of @xcite .",
    "for the galaxy , we defined the @xmath0 distribution using 1 ) the measurements made in the h & @xmath2 per clusters by @xcite and 2 ) the large sample of @xcite of bright field b stars , geneva photometry being used to determine @xmath12 through the calibration of @xcite .",
    "the sb2 systems were eliminated from this sample , which , although magnitude - limited , does not significantly differ from a volume limited one .",
    "the results are summarized in this figure .",
    "surprisingly , the overall @xmath0 distribution is almost exactly the same in the smc ( mean metallicity @xmath13 ) and in the lmc ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "there is only a marginal difference between h & @xmath2 per ( @xmath15 according to @xcite ) and the mcs , but a very significant one ( @xmath16  % ) between the galactic field ( @xmath17 ) and the mc fields .",
    "thus , either the metallicity effect saturates for @xmath18 , or another cause affects rotational velocities , e.g. different rates and orbital parameters of sb1 binaries ( not excluded from the samples ) , through tidal effects .",

    "<S> we show the @xmath0 distribution of main sequence b stars in sites of various metallicities , in the absolute magnitude range @xmath1 . these include galactic stars in the field measured by @xcite , members of the h & @xmath2 per open clusters measured by @xcite , and five fields in the smc and lmc measured at eso paranal with the flames - giraffe spectrograph , within the geneva - lausanne guaranteed time . following the suggestion by @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we do find a higher rate of rapid rotators in the magellanic clouds than in the galaxy , but the @xmath0 distribution is the same in the lmc and in the smc in spite of their very different metallicities . </S>"
