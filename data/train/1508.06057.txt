    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) can not be solved analytically at low energies .",
    "however , several aspects of qcd can be understood by using effective models which exhibit the same symmetries as qcd , most notably chiral symmetry .",
    "some models utilize exclusively hadronic degrees of freedom [ such as chiral @xmath2 models @xcite ] , while others feature constituent quarks [ such as the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite and the gross - neveu ( gn ) model @xcite ] . a model with both hadronic and quark degrees of freedom",
    "has also been discussed @xcite .",
    "all these effective descriptions of qcd include the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , which implies the emergence of a chiral condensate at low temperatures and densities denoted as @xmath2 .",
    "this quantity is represented by a nonzero expectation value of a scalar - isoscalar mesonic field in hadronic chiral models or , equivalently , by the quark - antiquark expectation value @xmath3 in quark - based models .",
    "the chiral condensate is , in general , a function of space , @xmath4 . in principle",
    ", the determination of @xmath5 is straightforward : one has to find the field configuration which minimizes the effective action at a given temperature and density .",
    "in practice , this task is , however , very difficult .",
    "this is why @xmath2 is often assumed to be spatially constant .",
    "this assumption is usually valid in the vacuum and at low densities , but not anymore at high densities .",
    "one of the simplest non - constant field configurations is the so - called chiral density wave ( cdw ) which , in chiral hadronic models , corresponds to a one - dimensional condensate of the form @xmath6 together with pion condensation , @xmath7 .",
    "various studies have found that the cdw is favorable compared to a constant condensate at sufficiently high densities @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a cdw has recently also been obtained within the extended linear sigma model @xcite , which is a general chiral hadronic model with ( axial-)vector degrees of freedom @xcite . moreover",
    ", inhomogeneous phases were also investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the njl model as well as in the quark - meson model and the skyrmion model .",
    "a general method to determine space - dependent condensates at non - zero temperature and density has not yet been established .",
    "there are a few exploratory studies of such methods in the context of the @xmath0 dimensional gn model , using either a lattice regularization @xcite of the effective action or an expansion in terms of plane waves or hat - like localized basis functions @xcite , but quite often one uses a specific ansatz @xcite .",
    "more evolved models including three spatial dimensions and two - dimensional variations of the condensates and corresponding general methods , which are also based on expansions of fermionic fields and condensates in terms of plane waves , have been discussed theoretically in refs .",
    "@xcite . in practice , however , due to limited computational resources , investigations have again been limited to specific anstze , where only a selected set of fourier modes is considered , e.g.  variations in only a single spatial dimension . in this respect models",
    "for which analytic inhomogeneous solutions are known are extremely interesting .",
    "this is the case for the @xmath0 dimensional gn model @xcite , where a soliton - like solution for the spatial dependence of the condensate is found , which is mathematically represented by a jacobi elliptic function @xcite .",
    "further interesting @xmath0 dimensional models for which inhomogeneous phases have analytically been determined are extensions of the gn model : the chiral gross - neveu ( @xmath8gn ) model @xcite , which has a continuous chiral symmetry , and the two - flavor njl@xmath9 model @xcite .",
    "these @xmath0 dimensional models are relevant , because at high densities qcd effectively reduces from @xmath1 to @xmath0 dimensions @xcite .",
    "thus , while the existence of inhomogeneous phases has been verified by several different approaches , it is highly desirable to develop a general and reliable numerical method to study inhomogeneous condensation , which does not require a specific ansatz for the spatial dependence of the condensate .",
    "this is the aim of the present work .",
    "we adapt and extend techniques introduced and explored in refs .",
    "we first test the validity and reliability of the resulting method , the finite - mode approach , by applying it to @xmath0 dimensional models , the gn , the @xmath8gn , and the njl@xmath9 model .",
    "we correctly reproduce both soliton - like and cdw modulations without supplying any specific ansatz .",
    "then we apply the finite - mode approach to study the phase structure of the @xmath1 dimensional njl model .",
    "recent findings @xcite concerning one - dimensional modulations are confirmed .",
    "in addition , we determine the shape of the so - called inhomogeneous `` continent '' at high density @xcite : in agreement with these works , the phase boundary between chirally restored and inhomogeneous phase first increases with temperature",
    ". however , for larger chemical potential @xmath10 it decreases .",

    "when restricting this condensate to be constant , chiral symmetry restoration at high densities occurs via a first - order phase transition @xcite .",

    "namely , in an inhomogeneous phase such as a cdw the quark propagator is not diagonal and the ingoing and outgoing momenta can differ by a full wavelength .",
    "this hardly takes place when the momentum @xmath47 is limited by the cutoff @xmath48 @xcite .",

    "however , at smaller @xmath10 the detailed shape of the phase diagram depends on the value of the effective quark mass .",
    "while at small @xmath45 an inhomogeneous island  may be separated from the continent , at larger @xmath45 the island and the continent merge .",

    "in this work we have used the finite - mode approach to investigate numerically the emergence of inhomogeneous chiral condensation in effective quark models in @xmath0 and @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "the main aim has been the determination of inhomogeneous condensation in qcd - inspired models without using a specific ansatz .",
    "we have shown that our method accurately reproduces well - known analytical results concerning the phase diagram and the inhomogeneous condensation of @xmath0 dimensional models , in particular the gross - neveu and chiral gross - neveu model . by applying the approach to the njl model in @xmath1 dimensions",
    "we could reproduce previous results based on specific anstze for small chemical potential .",
    "in addition to that we were able to show that the inhomogeneous continent of ref .",
    "@xcite extends to very high densities , but not to arbitrarily large temperatures . due to the fact that our results for the njl phase diagram differ from previous ones at high density",
    ", it would be an interesting task for future studies to confirm or to falsify the presence of the continent using different approaches .",
    "it is interesting to note that the gn model and the njl@xmath9 model have the same phase diagram , which in turn is also very similar to the njl model in 1 + 3 dimensions . on the contrary ,",
    "the phase diagram of the @xmath8gn model is completely different , showing that a different flavor structure has an impact on the phase diagram .",
    "our approach following refs .",
    "@xcite is based on expanding fermionic fields and condensates in terms of plane waves . in this respect",
    "it is quite similar to existing general methods to compute inhomogeneous condensates @xcite . in other aspects",
    "it is , however , quite different .",
    "for example our method is based on a minimization of the effective action , not the hamiltonian . a detailed and direct comparison regarding the computational efficiency of our method and those discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite is difficult and would require computations of the same quantities within the same model using both types of methods . since the basic idea of expanding in terms of plane waves is the same , we expect both types of methods to perform on a quantitatively similar level .",
    "therefore , further studies would be necessary to clarify why the shape of the continent  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : njl_reg3a5_comp ] ) looks different in the two methods .",
    "note that within our approach it is straightforward to replace the plane waves by another set of basis functions , as discussed and numerically demonstrated in refs .",
    "a first and straightforward step would be to still use a plane - wave expansion for the condensate , but to focus exclusively on higher modes in regions where the condensate is expected to exhibit strong oscillations ( typically in inhomogeneous regions at large chemical potential @xmath10 ) .",
    "using a small number of modes with suitably chosen wave number might allow to explore the phase diagram quite extensively at rather moderate computational cost .",
    "the choice of the wave numbers could even be automated , i.e. , included in the minimization procedure for the effective action .",
    "another possibility within our numerical framework is to study specific anstze to identify a small set of highly relevant degrees of freedom",
    ". this could not only provide certain physical insights , but also reduce the computing time significantly .",
    "the latter might be of particular importance , when studying two- or three - dimensional variations of the condensates .",
    "in the future one could also apply the finite - mode approach to study the phase diagram of purely hadronic theories such as the extended linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "this approach is capable to correctly describe the vacuum phenomenology as well as the nuclear matter ground state properties @xcite . as already shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , an inhomogeneous condensate in the form of a chiral density wave is favored with respect to a constant condensate at high density ( @xmath453 , where @xmath454 is the nuclear saturation density ) .",
    "it is an open question whether other structures minimize the effective potential even further .",
    "more generally , one could also apply the finite - mode approach to quark - based sigma models , e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "other interesting projects are the study of higher - dimensional modulations beyond the ansatz used in ref .",
    "@xcite and , since there is also no limitation in the number of inhomogeneous fields in the finite - mode approach , the study of interweaving chiral spirals @xcite .",
    "further effects at high densities such as inhomogeneous diquark condensation in @xmath0 as well as @xmath1 dimensions can also be taken into account @xcite .",
    "moreover , the models that we have studied were investigated in the chiral limit only .",
    "future work could thus include a non - zero bare quark mass into the effective approaches .",
