    "the recent development of metamaterials with negative refractive index has confirmed that structures can be fabricated that can be interpreted as having both a negative effective permittivity , @xmath0 , and a negative effective permeability , @xmath1 , simultaneously . since the original microwave experiments for the demonstration of negative index behavior in the split ring resonators ( srrs ) and wires structures ,",

    "there is an unresolved issue in the retrieval procedure , what is the size of the unit cell that needs to be used .",
    "most of the retrieval procedures use only one unit cell and made the assumption that if more than one unit cell will be used , the results will be the same as for the single unit cell .",

    "the normalized loss is a better measure of the absorption in a medium , since it removes the effect of the reflection due to the impendence mismatch at the interface between the medium and the vacuum space , which results in lower absolute loss .",
