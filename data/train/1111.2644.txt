    "spinor bose gases have been extensively studied since a decade ago when it was discovered that they display remarkable spin correlations because of spin - exchange scattering between atoms  @xcite .",
    "however , there have not been many investigations on many - body phenomena in mixtures of different spinor bose gases with interspecies spin exchanges . in the first instance , spin - exchange scattering between distinguishable atoms have been less studied , perhaps because of incomplete information on inter - atomic potential . to motivate more interests in this direction",
    ", we note that interspecies spin - exchange interaction can be significant .",
    "the previous experiments on multi - component bose gases often had atom loss due to spin exchanges  @xcite .",
    "there were early calculations indicating that the cross - sections of spin - exchange scattering between different atoms may not be smaller than those between identical atoms  @xcite .",
    "recently , there were more calculations as mentioned in the following , though motivated by studying a mixture of two species of atoms in frozen spin states , for which spin - exchange scattering is regarded as inelastic .",
    "a calculation for @xmath0na-@xmath1rb scattering indicated a quite large difference between scattering lengths of electronic singlet and triplet states  @xcite .",
    "this paper also reported a small value of such a singlet - triplet difference of scattering lengths for @xmath0na-@xmath2rb scattering , but contrary result was later reported  @xcite .",
    "another calculation found significant singlet - triplet differences of scattering lengths for x-@xmath3cs scattering , where x=@xmath4li , @xmath5li , @xmath6k , @xmath7k , @xmath1rb and @xmath2rb  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , significant differences between singlet and triplet scattering lengths have been observed in @xmath7k-@xmath2rb , @xmath8-@xmath2rb and @xmath4li(@xmath5li)-@xmath0na mixtures  @xcite , implying significant interspecies spin exchanges .",
    "spin - changing scattering was also observed in @xmath5li-@xmath3cs @xcite .",
    "moreover , heteronuclear feshbach resonances can be implemented  @xcite , which can enhance both elastic and inelastic collision rates  @xcite . to our understanding",
    ", some recent experimental set - ups on multi - species bose gases have come to close to what we need to realize a mixture of two species of spinor gases with interspecies spin exchange  @xcite",
    ".    further researches on mixtures of spinor gases with interspecies spin exchanges can be motivated by novel many - body quantum phenomena in such mixtures , as demonstrated first in a model of a mixture of pseudospin-@xmath9 atomic gases , where interspecies spin exchange leads to richer ground states and phenomena , especially bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) with interspecies quantum entanglement , which was dubbed entangled bose - einstein condensation ( ebec )  @xcite . as usual ,",
    "two subsystems constituting the total system are entangled if the state of the total system is not a direct product of those of the subsystems . otherwise , they are called disentangled .",
    "this line of researches has been extended to a mixture of two species of spin-@xmath10 atomic gases  @xcite , in which the interspecies spin coupling is simply of heisenberg form  @xcite . in the usual approach of single orbit - mode approximation ,",
    "most of the exact ground states in absence of a magnetic field have been found  @xcite .",
    "however , in presence of a magnetic field , only two special parameter regimes have been considered  @xcite .",
    "given that the magnetic field effect is an important issue , in the present paper , we systematically study the ground states in presence of a weak magnetic field , and find out how a magnetic field affects the ground states and phase diagrams of a spinor mixture with interspecies spin exchanges .",

    "consider a mixture of two species @xmath17 and @xmath18 of spin-1 atoms , whose numbers @xmath19 and @xmath20 are conserved respectively .",
    "the single - atom hamiltonian of species @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a uniform magnetic field , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the mass , the gyromagnetic ratio , the external potential and the single - spin operator , respectively , for an atom of species @xmath21 . with @xmath29 representing the field operator corresponding to spin @xmath30 component of species @xmath21 ( @xmath31 ) , the many - body hamiltonian is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the usual hamiltonian of spin-1 atoms  @xcite , @xmath34 is the interspecies interaction  @xcite , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are expansion coefficients in terms of powers of dot product of the single - spin matrices of two atoms of species @xmath21 and are linear combinations of singlet and triplet scattering lengths , @xmath36 is proportional to the differences between triplet and single scattering lengths of intraspecies scattering  @xcite , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are similar quantities for scattering between an @xmath17-atom and a @xmath18-atom , @xmath38 is proportional to the differences between triplet and single scattering lengths of interspecies scattering , and it has been shown that the coefficient of @xmath39 is zero  @xcite .    for each species and each spin state , we follow the usual single mode approximation for the single - particle orbital wave function , and the usual assumption that this single particle orbital wave function is independent of spin .",
    "therefore we have @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the annihilation operator and @xmath42 is the lowest single - particle orbital wave function for species @xmath21 and spin - independent .",
    "then the hamiltonian can be simplified as @xmath43 where a constant is neglected , @xmath44 is the total spin operator for species @xmath21 , @xmath45 is the intraspecies spin coupling strength , @xmath46 , as indeed so for atoms with a same nuclear spin .",
    "here we have neglected the quadratic zeeman effect .",
    "this is reasonable under certain circumstances , as can be estimated by using parameter values for na  @xcite .",
    "the quadratic zeeman energy is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , @xmath49 can be @xmath50 mg to @xmath51 mg , hence the quadratic zeeman energy is about @xmath52 to @xmath53hz .",

    ", we shall first take a look at the case of @xmath75 .",
    "as we shall discuss different ground states in different regimes of the parameter space , some explanation of the nomenclature is in order here .",
    "the ground states in two neighboring parameter regimes are said to be continuously connected if each of them approaches the ground state on the boundary , when the parameters approach the boundary .",
    "it is then said that they belong to a same quantum phase .",
    "in contrast , if the two ground states in the two neighboring regimes approach different limits when the parameters approach the boundary , it is said that there is a discontinuity or quantum phase transition .",
    "there are several cases of discontinuity , for example , the two limits may be both different from the that on boundary , and they may also be two of the degenerate ground states on the boundary , besides , there is also the case that the ground state in one of the regimes approaches a ground state on the boundary , while the ground state in the other regime approaches a different limit .",
    "the most interesting ground states in our system are those of ebec , i.e. bec with interspecies entanglement .",

    "<S> we consider a mixture of two species of spin-1 atoms with both interspecies and intraspecies spin exchanges in a weak magnetic field . under the usual single mode approximation </S>",
    "<S> , it can be reduced to a model of coupled giant spins . </S>",
    "<S> we find most of its ground states . </S>",
    "<S> this is a complicated problem of energy minimization , with three quantum variables under constraints , i.e. the total spin of each species and the total spin of the whole mixture , as well as four parameters , including intraspecies and interspecies spin coupling strengths and the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum phase diagram is very rich . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the case without a magnetic field , the ground states are modified by a magnetic field , which also modifies the ground state boundaries or introduces new crossover regimes on the phase diagram . without interspecies spin coupling , the quantum phase transitions existing in absence of a magnetic field disappear when a magnetic field is applied , which leads to crossover regimes in the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> under ferromagnetic interspecies spin coupling , the ground states remain disentangled no matter whether there is a magnetic field . for antiferromagnetic interspecies </S>",
    "<S> spin coupling , a magnetic field entangles the ground states in some parameter regimes . when the intraspecies spin couplings are both ferromagnetic , the quantum phase transition between antiferromagnetic and zero interspecies spin couplings survives the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> when the intraspecies spin couplings are both antiferromagnetic , a magnetic field induces new quantum phase transitions between antiferromagnetic and zero interspecies spin couplings . </S>"
