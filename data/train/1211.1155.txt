    "namely , we think that the present results can qualitatively explain the experimentally observed mass enhancement towards @xmath7 ( ref . ) ; the actual calculation about the mass enhancement is a remaining future work .",
    "we first compare our results with the previous theoretical studies about the magnetic properties for ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 with @xmath13 .",
    "the mean - field calculation  @xcite for @xmath13 has found that the dominant contribution to the static susceptibility arises from that for the @xmath8 orbital .",
    "this calculation has also shown that the increase of @xmath136 leads to the enhancement of the ic af spin fluctuation around @xmath139 , and that this ic af spin fluctuation is strongest only for @xmath140 at @xmath141 .",
    "note that this mode of the enhanced ic af spin fluctuation is different from @xmath142 , which is enhanced in our study , due to the difference in the values of the hopping integrals .",
    "these results suggest that a moderately large hund s rule coupling plays an important role for @xmath13 .",
    "this is consistent with the previous dynamical mean - field theory  @xcite for @xmath13 . similarly to this mean - field study ,  @xcite we find that the increase of @xmath136 leads to the enhancement of the ic af spin fluctuations around @xmath123 and @xmath122 ; the former ic af spin fluctuation is strongest for @xmath143 at @xmath144",
    ". since the enhancement of the ic af spin fluctuation at @xmath145 has been experimentally observed ,  @xcite we think that a set of the parameters used in this study is more realistic than in this previous mean - field study ( ref . ) .",
    "next , we address the physical meaning of the results obtained in the rpa , and compare our results with the studies in more elaborated treatments . the rpa is a mean - field - type approximation and neglects the mode - mode coupling for fluctuations .",
    "in general , the mode - mode coupling plays an important role in discussing the electronic states near a quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "@xcite for example , it weakens the instability obtained in the rpa .",
    "actually , the previous study  @xcite for @xmath13 in fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation has observed much larger @xmath110 than in the rpa ; the flex approximation is partially taken account of the mode - mode coupling .",
    "we thus expect that the values of @xmath110 will be more realistic than those obtained in this paper .",
    "in addition to this , the mode - mode coupling can change the primary instability from that obtained in the rpa .",
    "thus , the results about the primary instability may change when the mode - mode coupling is taken into account .",
    "actually , the previous study  @xcite for @xmath13 in the flex approximation found that the ic af spin fluctuation with @xmath139 is very strong , while the spin fluctuations with @xmath121 and @xmath105 are strongly enhanced in the rpa ; the reason why this mode of the enhanced ic af spin fluctuation in the flex is different from that in our study is the same as that for a case of the difference between the previous mean - field study  @xcite and ours .",
    "however , we believe that the competition between the modes of spin fluctuation around @xmath5 and @xmath9 for the model of @xmath7 , which is obtained in this study , will not change even in a more elaborated treatment since the momentum dependence of @xmath102 is very flat ; in such a case , it will be difficult that the mode - mode coupling favors a specific mode .",
    "actually , our preliminary calculation  @xcite in the flex approximation observes the similar competition of spin fluctuations around these modes for the model of @xmath7 .",
    "there are several density - functional calculations to study the ground states for @xmath3 . among them",
    ", a density - functional calculation within local - density approximation ( lda ) has found that the rotation of ruo@xmath11 octahedra enhances the ferromagnetic ( fm ) instability .",
    "@xcite another density - functional calculation  @xcite for @xmath7 within the lda has predicted the nesting instability with @xmath146 .",
    "the authors have proposed that this nesting instability will lead to the mass enhancement around @xmath7 ; this nesting vector is related to a new fs induced by the rotation - induced hybridization of the @xmath8 orbital to the @xmath48 orbital . in our study , this new fs does not appear since we have not treated directly the rotation - induced hybridization of the @xmath8 orbital to the @xmath48 orbital ; instead , we take account of the effect of this hybridization as the difference of the cef energies between the @xmath49 and @xmath8 orbitals , as denoted in sec .",
    "in contrast to this density - functional calculaiton  @xcite , another density - functional calculation for @xmath7 within local spin - density approximation has found a disappearance of this nesting vector in the presence of the spin - orbit interaction , which is equal to @xmath147 ev .",
    "@xcite it is thus necessary to study the effects of this new fs on the electronic structures around @xmath7 in more detail .",
    "however , we think that the presence of this new fs will not lead to the drastic changes from the present results since this rotation - induced fs is small and the dos for each ru @xmath4 orbital obtained in this study is almost the same as that obtained in these density - functional studies ( refs . and ) .    finally , we compare the obtained results with the previous study  @xcite in the gutzwiller approximation . this previous study calculated the total renormalization factor of the kinetic energy for the ru @xmath4 orbitals , which is inversely proportional to the mass enhancement , and found that the inverse of the total renormalization factor is largest for the model of @xmath7 .",
    "namely , these results can reproduce the experimentally observed tendency of the effective mass in @xmath3 ( ref . ) .",
    "these results suggest that the criticality approaching the usual mott transition plays an important role in enhancing the effective mass towards @xmath7 ; in this usual mott insulator , the occupation numbers for the @xmath49 and @xmath8 orbitals are 1 and 2 , respectively . on the other hand , in this study , we find that several modes of spin fluctuation for the @xmath8 orbital around @xmath5 and @xmath148 are strongly enhanced for the model of @xmath7 . as discussed above , this enhancement of several modes will lead to the larger mass enhancement for @xmath7 than for @xmath13 .",
    "this mechanism of the mass enhancement can coexist with the proposal in the previous study  @xcite in the gutzwiller approximation since the former and latter mass enhancements arise from the nonlocal and local effects .",
    "in other words , not only the criticality approaching the usual mott transition , but also the spin fluctuations for the @xmath8 orbital around @xmath5 and @xmath9 play an important role in enhancing the effective mass towards @xmath7 .",
    "we first address the correspondence of our results with several experimental results at @xmath13 .",
    "in addition to the inelastic neutron measurement ,  @xcite our results are consistent with the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurement .  @xcite this experiment has found that not only the ic af spin fluctuation at @xmath108 but also the fm spin fluctuation plays the non - negligible role in enhancing the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate at a ru site .",
    "this result indicates that the fm spin fluctuation also plays an important role in discussing the magnetic properties for @xmath13 . actually , we see that the spin fluctuation around @xmath5 is non - negligible , although the dominant components arise from the ic spin fluctuations around @xmath103 , @xmath105 , @xmath122 , and @xmath107 .",
    "next , we compare our results with several experimental results in the presence of the rotation of ruo@xmath11 octahedra . a recent muon spin relaxation ( @xmath34sr ) measurement  @xcite for ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 with @xmath7 and @xmath149 and sr@xmath126ru@xmath150ti@xmath151o@xmath2 with @xmath152 has shown that the muon relaxation rates rapidly increase as temperature decreases , and that the zero - field @xmath34sr time spectra are similar to those for dilute - alloy spin glasses .",
    "the authors have proposed the static spin glass order not only in sr@xmath126ru@xmath150ti@xmath151o@xmath2 but also in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 for @xmath153 .",
    "however , all the previous experimental studies for ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 in @xmath3 ( refs .  ) have suggested that the ground states are the pm metals .",
    "in addition , the elastic neutron measurement for @xmath154 by the authors for this @xmath34sr measurement has observed the absence of the ordered moment for @xmath154 , while the @xmath34sr measurement has estimated the ordered moment at @xmath155 per ru .",
    "therefore , we think that the conclusion for this @xmath34sr measurement is doubtful , and that it is reasonable to analyze the static susceptibilities in the pm states to discuss the electronic states around @xmath7 .",
    "we now discuss the correspondence with several neutron measurements .",
    "the polarized neutron diffraction measurement  @xcite for @xmath7 has observed the anisotropic spin density distribution at a ru site , which is flattened along @xmath156 axis .",
    "this result suggests that the main part of the spin density arises from that for the @xmath8 orbital .",
    "namely , the spin fluctuation for the @xmath8 orbital is predominant at @xmath7 . actually , we find that the dominant contributions to the spin fluctuation arise from that for the @xmath8 orbital , which are consistent with this experimental result .",
    "in addition to this neutron measurement , the inelastic neutron measurements  @xcite for @xmath157 have found that the fm scattering is maximum at an energy transfer of @xmath158 mev , while the ic scatterings with @xmath159 and @xmath160 evolve at an energy transfer of @xmath161 mev .",
    "these results indicate that the fm spin fluctuation is predominant at a lower energy transfer , while the ic spin fluctuations evolve as an energy transfer increases .",
    "furthermore , these measurements  @xcite have observed the intensity spreading in momentum space around the maximum peak and the large amplitude of the real part of the dynamic susceptibility at the maximum peak .",
    "these results indicate that several modes of spin fluctuation are more strongly enhanced for @xmath157 than for @xmath13 , and that ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 with @xmath157 is located nearer to the boundary of the magnetic instability .",
    "therefore , all the results for the model of @xmath7 and the special model are qualitatively consistent with these experimental results except the evolution of the ic scatterings .",
    "it is necessary to study the origin of the evolution of these ic scatterings .",
    "our result for the model of @xmath7 is also consistent with the nmr measuerement ,  @xcite in which the evolution of the fm spin fluctuation has been observed towards @xmath7 .",
    "this result of the nmr measurement is consistent with the dependence of the wilson ratio on the sr concentration .",
    "@xcite    we now briefly remark on the metamagnetic transition observed for ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 in the range of @xmath162 .",
    "@xcite in this study , we focus on the electronic states for @xmath3 only in the absence of the external magnetic field .",
    "it is necessary to study the effects of the external magnetic field on the fluctuations for charge and spin sectors ; this issue is a remaining future work .    finally",
    ", we remark on the curie - weiss ( cw ) behavior in the spin susceptibility with a curie constant corresponding to nearly @xmath163 for @xmath164 .",
    "@xcite the origin of this cw behavior has not been clarified yet .",
    "in general , there are two mechanisms in emerging the cw - type temperature dependence in the spin susceptibility .",
    "@xcite one is due to the formation of the localized moment , and the other is due to the drastic renormalization of the temperature dependence for the free energy by enhanced fluctuations . in the latter mechanism , the mode - mode coupling leads to this drastic renormalization .",
    "@xcite the emergence of the cw behavior in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 will arise from the latter mechanism since all electrons for the ru @xmath4 orbitals are itinerant in @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite in addition , we find for the model of @xmath7 that several modes of spin fluctuation for the @xmath8 orbital around @xmath5 and @xmath148 are strongly enhanced , and that the dominant contributions to the susceptibilities for a spin sector arise from those for the @xmath8 orbital .",
    "therefore , we think that the mode - mode coupling for the @xmath8 orbital will play a more important role in discussing the spin susceptibility around @xmath7 than for the @xmath49 orbital . it is necessary to study the electronic states around @xmath7 on the basis of the microscopic theory taking account of the mode - mode coupling",
    "to clarify the effects of the nonlocal ( but not long - range ) correlation on the electronic structures in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 around @xmath7 , we studied the static susceptibilities for charge and spin sectors in the pm states within the rpa for the models of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and a special model .",
    "in particular , we analyzed the effects of the rotation of ruo@xmath11 octahedra , the vhs for the @xmath8 orbital , and the hund s rule coupling on these static susceptibilities .",
    "first , we analyzed the effects of the rotation of ruo@xmath11 octahedra by comparing the results at @xmath101 for the models of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the absence of interactions",
    ", we found that the rotation of ruo@xmath11 octahedra leads to the increase of the noninteracting susceptibility for the @xmath8 orbital around @xmath5 and the shifts of the ic peak for the @xmath49 and @xmath8 orbitals towards @xmath99 and @xmath165 .",
    "for the model of @xmath13 in the rpa , we found that @xmath102 at @xmath103 touches zero at @xmath104 , and that there are two main peaks in @xmath102 at @xmath121 and @xmath105 and two secondary peaks at @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the two main peaks arise from the corresponding fluctuations for the @xmath8 orbital , and the secondary peaks at @xmath106 and @xmath107 arise from the corresponding fluctuation for the @xmath17 orbital and the combined fluctuation of the @xmath49 and @xmath8 orbitals .",
    "we also found that @xmath119 with @xmath103 , @xmath122 , and @xmath107 are dominant at @xmath116 , while @xmath119 with @xmath142 becomes largest at @xmath124 .",
    "the main peak in @xmath102 at @xmath166 is less important at @xmath116 and @xmath120 . for the model of @xmath7 in the rpa",
    ", we found that @xmath102 at @xmath5 touches zero at @xmath112 , which is smaller than for the model of @xmath13 , and that there are two main peaks in @xmath102 at @xmath5 and @xmath6 and a secondary peak at @xmath114 .",
    "in contrast to the case of @xmath13 , all the peaks in @xmath102 arise from the corresponding susceptibilities for the @xmath8 orbital .",
    "we also found that @xmath119 at @xmath5 and @xmath114 are dominant at @xmath116 , while @xmath119 at @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath127 are nearly same at @xmath124 .",
    "the values of @xmath119 along @xmath128 are larger than along @xmath129 .",
    "furthermore , we found that the peaks in @xmath102 for the model of @xmath7 are less sharp than for the model of @xmath13 .",
    "these less sharp peaks and the smaller value of @xmath110 will lead to a larger effective mass for the model of @xmath7 than for the model of @xmath13 .",
    "second , to analyze the effects of the vhs for the @xmath8 orbital , we compared the results at @xmath101 for the special model with those for the model of @xmath7 . in the absence of interactions , we found the larger increase of the noninteracting susceptibility for the @xmath8 orbital and the smaller shifts of the ic peak for the @xmath49 and @xmath8 orbitals towards @xmath99 and @xmath165 in the special model .",
    "the former is due to the larger increase of the dos for the @xmath8 orbital near the fermi level , and the latter is due to the smaller value of @xmath50 . in the presence of interactions",
    ", we found that the value of @xmath110 , where @xmath102 at @xmath5 touches zero , is smaller for the special model than for the model of @xmath7 , and that there is a main peak at @xmath5 and there is a secondary peak at @xmath131 ; the latter peak corresponds to the peak at @xmath6 for the model of @xmath7 .",
    "we also found that all the peaks in @xmath102 for the special model are slightly sharper than for the model of @xmath7 , and that the competition between the modes of spin fluctuation around @xmath5 and @xmath9 is weaker for the special model .",
    "furthermore , we found that all the enhanced modes in @xmath102 arise from the corresponding fluctuations for the @xmath8 orbital , and that the dominant contributions to the static susceptibility for a spin sector arise from those for the @xmath8 orbital around @xmath5 and @xmath9 ; these results are qualitatively the same as those for the model of @xmath7 .",
    "third , we analyzed the @xmath96 dependencies of the static susceptibilities for the models of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and the special model .",
    "for all these models , we found that the dominant wave vectors of the static susceptibilities at @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the same as those at @xmath101 , that the increase of @xmath136 leads to the decrease of @xmath110 , and that the static susceptibility for a charge sector is enhanced only at @xmath134 .",
    "in addition to these , we found for the model of @xmath13 that the increase of @xmath136 enhances the ic af spin fluctuations at @xmath123 and @xmath122 , and that the former ic af spin fluctuation is strongest for @xmath143 at @xmath144 ; these modes correspond to the secondary peaks in @xmath102 at @xmath101 .",

    "in contrast to the case of @xmath13 , the increase of @xmath136 leads to a nearly uniform enhancement of @xmath119 for the model of @xmath7 and the special model .",
