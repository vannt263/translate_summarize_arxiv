    "according to @xcite a steiner bundle @xmath0 on @xmath7 has a linear resolution of the form @xmath8 it is well known that steiner bundles have rank @xmath9 and if equality holds then they are stable , in particular they are simple ( see @xcite ) .",

    "is partially contained , although somehow hidden , in @xcite .",
    "indeed drzet and le potier find a criterion to check the stability of a generic bundle , given its rank and chern classes . in the case of a normalized steiner bundle @xmath0 on @xmath23",
    ", it is possible to prove that if @xmath0 satisfies condition @xmath22 of the main theorem , then the drzet - le potier condition for stability is satisfied .",
    "hence @xmath0 is stable and , consequently , simple . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath0 is not normalized , it is very complicated to check the criterion of drzet - le potier , but we can easily prove the simplicity with other techniques . anyway",
    "the proof that we present in this paper is independent of @xcite , is more elementary and works on @xmath1 as well .",
    "the genericity assumption can not be dropped , because when @xmath24 it is always possible to find a decomposable steiner bundle , that is in particular non - simple . since the equivalence between conditions @xmath25 and @xmath26 is an arithmetic statement , our theorem claims that @xmath3 is the responsible for the simplicity of a generic steiner bundle @xmath0 .",
    "indeed it is easy to check that if @xmath0 is simple then @xmath27 ( lemma [ facile ] ) and this is also true for some other bundles , for example for every bundle on @xmath23 .",
    "the converse is not true in general , because it is possible to find a non - simple bundle @xmath28 on @xmath23 such that @xmath29 .",
    "for example we can consider the cokernel f of a generic map of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 , but it can be shown that @xmath32 therefore @xmath28 is not simple .    in the third statement of our theorem",
    "we claim that if @xmath0 is a simple steiner bundle , then either @xmath0 is exceptional or it satisfies a numerical inequality ( see theorem [ teoeccezionali ] ) .",
    "we recall that exceptional bundles have no deformations .",
    "the name exceptional in this setting is justified by the fact that they are the only simple steiner bundles which violate the numerical inequality .",
    "it is remarkable to note that all the exceptional bundles on @xmath23 can be constructed by the theory of helices , in particular there exists a correspondence between the exceptional bundles on the projective plane and the solutions of the markov equation @xmath33 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows : section @xmath34 is devoted to the case of exceptional bundles and section @xmath35 to the proof of the main theorem . at the end of the paper , theorem [ ananum ] is a reformulation in terms of matrices of the main theorem . as a basic reference for bundles on @xmath1 see @xcite .",
    "i would like to thank giorgio ottaviani , for suggesting me the problem and for his continuous assistance , and enrique arrondo , for many useful discussions .",
    "i also thank very much jean valls , for his helpful comments concerning this work , in particular for his collaboration in simplifying the proof of lemma [ principale ] .",
    "in @xcite the theory of helices of exceptional bundles is developed in a general axiomatic presentation .",

    "lemma [ lemmaeliche ] states that the bundles @xmath48 , defined as in , are exceptional for all @xmath53 .",
    "obviously their dual @xmath54 are exceptional too .",
    "now we will prove that , for every @xmath55 , the bundle @xmath54 admits the following resolution @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the sequence defined in the statement .",

    "let @xmath78 be the restriction of @xmath74 to @xmath79 .",
    "then we can check that @xmath78 is injective , its cokernel is @xmath80 and the following diagram commutes : @xmath81 & f^*_{n-1}\\ar[u]\\ar[r ] &    f^*_n\\otimes v^*\\ar[r]\\ar[u]&f^*_{n+1}\\ar[r]\\ar[u ] & 0 \\\\ 0\\ar[r ] & { \\mathcal{o}}^{a_{n-1}}\\ar[u ]    \\ar@{-->}[r]^{\\widetilde{\\alpha}}\\ar[ur]^{\\alpha }        &    { \\mathcal{o}}^{a_n}\\otimes v^*\\ar[r ]   \\ar[u ] &    { \\mathcal{o}}^{a_{n+1 } }   \\ar[r]\\ar[u ]   & 0 \\\\ 0\\ar[r ] & { \\mathcal{o}}(-1)^{a_{n-2}}\\ar[u ]   \\ar@{-->}[r]^{\\widetilde{\\beta } }       &    { \\mathcal{o}}(-1)^{a_{n-1}}\\otimes v^ *   \\ar[u]\\ar[r ] & { \\mathcal{o}}(-1)^{a_n } \\ar[u ]      \\ar[r ] & 0\\\\         &      0\\ar[u ]   &   0     \\ar[u ]             & 0\\ar[u ] & } \\ ] ] it follows that @xmath82 has the resolution @xmath83 and this completes the proof of our theorem .",

    "let the pair @xmath126 satisfy , then , using the recursive definition , we check that @xmath127 is a solution too .",

    "in fact @xmath139 and , moreover , @xmath140 and @xmath141      now we prove the last implication , i.e.  @xmath22 implies @xmath142 . in the case",
    "@xmath20 , the generic @xmath143 is an exceptional bundle by theorem [ teoeccezionali ] , therefore it is in particular simple .",
    "so suppose @xmath18 and recall that @xmath144 denotes @xmath145 let @xmath146 be the set @xmath147 and @xmath148 and @xmath149 the projections on @xmath150 and on @xmath144 respectively .",

    ". therefore @xmath171 belongs to @xmath172 and consequently @xmath173 .",
    "finally it suffices to prove that for all generic @xmath151 , the dimension of the stabilizer is exactly @xmath4 . in other words",
    "we have to prove the following      recall that we have defined the following diagram @xmath177^{\\pi_1}\\ar[dr]_{\\pi_2}&\\\\ \\operatorname{gl}(i)\\times\\operatorname{gl}(w)&&h } \\ ] ] let @xmath97 be two fixed jordan canonical forms in @xmath93 .",
    "we define @xmath178 as the set of couples of matrices similar respectively to @xmath169 and @xmath179 .",
    "note that @xmath180 .",
    "moreover @xmath181 and @xmath182",
    ".      suppose that the assertion is false .",
    "then there exist two jordan canonical forms @xmath169 and @xmath179 , different from @xmath183 , such that @xmath185 is not contained in any closed subset .",
    "this implies that we can take a general @xmath151 such that @xmath186 and in particular we can suppose the rank of @xmath92 maximum .",
    "now we prove that @xmath169 and @xmath179 have the same minimal polynomial .",
    "first , if @xmath187 is the minimal polynomial of @xmath179 , i.e.@xmath188 , then it follows that @xmath189 and since @xmath92 is injective we get @xmath190 , hence the minimal polynomial of @xmath179 divides that of @xmath169 .",
    "now if we denote by @xmath191 ( @xmath192 ) the eigenvalues of @xmath169 and by @xmath193 ( @xmath194 ) those of @xmath179 , we obtain that @xmath195 for all @xmath196 .",

    "therefore @xmath204 and developing this expression we see that @xmath205 .",
    "in fact if there exists a @xmath206 for all @xmath207 , then there is a row of zeroes in @xmath92 and consequently @xmath92 is not generic .",
    "then we get @xmath169 and @xmath179 with the same eigenvalues @xmath191 ( @xmath208 ) with multiplicity respectively @xmath209 and @xmath210 . the hypothesis that @xmath171 means that either @xmath169 and @xmath179 have more than one eigenvalue or at least one of them is non - diagonal .",
    "now consider the first case , i.e.  @xmath211 . since @xmath212 and @xmath213 , obviously @xmath214 e @xmath215 .",
    "now we denote @xmath216 , where @xmath217 has dimension @xmath218 .",
