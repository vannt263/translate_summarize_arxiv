    "the zero temperature quantum phase transitions between the different quantum hall and insulating states of a two - dimensional electron gas in a strong magnetic field are among the most intensively studied quantum critical points , both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "earlier theoretical investigations focussed on the transitions between the integer quantum hall plateaus and described them in terms of non - interacting electrons moving in a random external potential  @xcite .",
    "ludwig _ et .",
    "al _ introduced and analyzed a dirac fermion model with random mass , random scalar potential and random gauge potential .",
    "they found that the random mass is marginally _ irrelevant _ , random scalar potential marginally _",
    "relevant_. however , they found that random vector potential is exactly _ marginal _ , therefore there is a line of fixed points characterized by the strength of the random gauge potential , the zero energy wavefunction shows multifractal behaviors with the exponents continuously changing along the line@xcite .",
    "if two of the random potentials are non - zero , the third one will be generated and the system flows to strong coupling regime .",
    "they further argued that the system should flow to the generic fixed point of integer quantum hall transitions which was correctly described by chalker - coddington model @xcite .",
    "the properties of the fixed line of dirac fermions in the presence of random magnetic fields were further investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "later , the @xmath14 gauge potential was extended to non - abelian gauge potential @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that the transitions between fractional quantum hall states could be mapped onto models essentially equivalent to those between the integer states  @xcite .",
    "the latter point of view was however questioned by wen and wu  @xcite and chen , fisher and wu  @xcite : they focussed on the simpler case of systems in the presence of a _ periodic _ rather than a random potential , and examined a model of anyons , with a statistical angle @xmath15 and short - range repulsive interactions , which displayed a second order quantum phase transition between a quantized hall state and a mott insulator as the strength of the periodic potential was varied .",
    "this transition was characterized by a line of critical points with continuously varying exponents , parameterized by the value of @xmath15 . for the case",
    "@xmath16 , when the anyons were fermions , the transition was out of a integer quantum hall state ; its exponents and other universal properties were different from the cases @xmath17 for which the anyons acquired fractional statistics and the transition was out a fractional quantum hall state .",
    "( for @xmath18 the anyons became bosons and the hall state reduced to a superfluid . )    in all of the above theoretical works , the long - range coulomb interactions between charge carriers have been effectively ignored however , a few recent works have taken steps to remedy this serious shortcoming .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the integer quantum hall transition under a hatree - fock treatment of the coulomb interaction .",
    "lee and wang  @xcite showed that the renormalization group eigenvalue of the coulomb interaction was zero at the hartree - fock critical point ; higher order calculations are therefore necessary to understand the physics .",
    "pfannkuche and macdonald  @xcite numerically studied electrons with coulomb interactions in a periodic potential between a fractional hall state and an insulator , but were limited to rather small system sizes .",
    "interesting scaling interpretations of coulomb interaction - induced dephasing were discussed in ref  @xcite .",
    "most recently , neglecting the disorders , ye and sachdev provided a thorough analysis of the consequences of coulomb interactions on the anyons in a periodic potential model of refs  @xcite .",
    "they showed that the coulomb interaction is _ marginally irrelevant _ for the integer case ( @xmath19 ) , and remains so for the fractional case for small values of @xmath15 ; this marginally irrelevant interaction will lead to logarithmic corrections to naive scaling functions for the vicinity of the transition . for larger @xmath15 , they established , in a certain @xmath20 expansion , the existence of a novel line of fixed points at which the coulomb interactions acquire a non - zero fixed point value determined by the value of @xmath15 .",
    "there are no logarithmic corrections at these fixed points , and naive scaling holds .",
    "they found a dynamic critical exponent @xmath21 at all points on the fixed line , providing a concrete realization of the scenario  @xcite , not previously established explicitly , that energies must scale as inverse distances for the @xmath22 coulomb interaction .",
    "they also found the correlation length exponent @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the spatial dimensionality ) along this fixed line , which implies that the fixed line is stable against weak random mass disorder .    in this paper , we study in detail the consequences of random mass , random scalar potential and random vector potential at the line of fixed points . in the rest of this section , we introduce the notations and the model . in the next section ,",

    "it was shown in ref  @xcite that @xmath53 represents the critical theory of a system of anyons in a periodic potential undergoing a transition from an insulator with conductivities @xmath59 into a fractional quantum hall state with @xmath60 and @xmath61 to leading order in @xmath20 .",

    "the relationship of the continuum model @xmath53 to the more realistic model of electrons studied in ref  @xcite remains somewhat unclear , although it is plausible that @xmath53 is the critical theory of the latter .",
    "we may also view @xmath53 as the simplest theory consistent with the following requirements , and therefore worthy of further study : ( _ i _ ) the two phases on either side of the critical point have the correct values of @xmath62 , and the hall phase has _ both _ quasi - particle and quasi - hole excitations with the correct charge and statistics , and ( _ ii _ ) the gap towards the quasi - particle _ and _ the quasi - hole excitations vanishes at the critical point .",
    "we now proceed with a renormalization group analysis of @xmath53 .",
    "simple power counting shows that the chern - simons , coulomb interactions  @xcite and all three kinds of disorders are marginal at tree level in @xmath63 , and so loop expansions are required and useful .",
    "power counting also shows that a short - range four - fermion interaction term is _ irrelevant _ and has therefore been neglected in @xmath53 ; this makes the fermionic formulation of the anyon problem much simpler than its bosonic counterpart  @xcite .",
    "we assume all the three kinds of disorder satisfy gaussian distribution with zero mean and variances @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath64        in general , counter terms for the last two gauge field terms in @xmath53 should also be considered . however , it was shown  @xcite that at least to two loops , there no divergences associated with these terms .",
    "the ward identities following from gauge invariance dictate @xmath68    using these identities , we relate the bare fields and couplings in @xmath53 to the renormalized quantities by @xmath69    notice that these relations imply that for the statistical angle @xmath70 we have @xmath71 even in the presence of the coulomb interaction and the disorders ; so in @xmath63 this angle is a renormalization group invariant , which is expected on general physical grounds .",
    "the dynamic critical exponent , @xmath72 is related to the renormalization of @xmath49 by  @xcite @xmath73    we will find it convenient to express the loop expansion in terms of the `` fine structure '' constant @xmath74 , and a central object of study shall be its @xmath75-function @xmath76 . by comparing ( [ zval ] ) with relationships between bare and renormalized quantities quoted above",
