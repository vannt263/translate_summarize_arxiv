    "besides the analytical @xmath0-particle quantum mechanical calculations  @xcite , the scattering of the soliton has also been investigated via numerical methods on the @xmath0-particle level  @xcite .",
    "different approaches to obtain such schrdinger cat states or related fragmentations have been investigated in refs .",
    "contrary to schrdinger cat states of a single atom  @xcite , cat - like states of radiation  @xcite or mesoscopic spin - squeezed states ( which have already been realised experimentally  @xcite ) , the experimental realisation of schrdinger cat states of say , 100 atoms , is still a challenge of fundamental research .",
    "suggestions how interesting quantum superpositions might be obtained can be found , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .    for bright quantum matter wave solitons",
    "@xcite , the mean - field ( gross - pitaevskii ) limit has been shown to be achieved already for particle numbers as low as @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "many of the papers published after the ground - breaking experiments  @xcite solve the gross - pitaevskii equation for solitons .",
    "however , any mesoscopic entangled state which involves superpositions of wavefunctions can not be described by a non - linear equation and therefore the reasoning of ref .",
    "@xcite is not valid in the situation considered here .",
    "thus , instead of applying the gross - pitaevskii equation , the @xmath0-particle schrdinger equation has to be used to reveal true quantum behaviour of a soliton created from a bose - einstein condensate . under experimentally realistic conditions ,",
    "the schrdinger equation is given by the analytically solvable lieb - liniger(-mcguire ) model .",
    "the challenge of the generation of mesoscopic superpositions via scattering of solitons is that to add a scattering potential removes the separability of the centre - of - mass motion and the relative motion ; in order to avoid that the scattering potential acts like a beam splitter on each single atom ( rather than the entire soliton ) , the initial state has to be prepared carefully .",
    "mesoscopic entangled states with the soliton being in a quantum superposition with @xmath2 probability of moving to the right / left should thus be obtainable .",
    "the probability to find  in a _ single measurement _  ( at least ) one particle moving to the right and at ( at least ) one particle moving in the other direction will be negligible",
    ". however , this will not be enough to prove that the two parts of the wavefunction really are in a quantum superposition  if someone claims that a coin is in a quantum superposition of heads and tails , an experiment showing only the classical outcomes would hardly convince anyone .",
    "the experimental verification could be delivered via interference experiments  @xcite .    rather than dealing with bright @xmath0-particle quantum solitons",
    ", this paper treats a simpler but nevertheless instructive case : dimers in an optical lattice .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : after a short summary of how to describe the scattering of bright solitons analytically  @xcite ( sec .  [",
    "sec : liebliniger ] ) , the two - particle bound states used to describe the scattering of the dimer are introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : two ] .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] shows the numeric results in the limit where the motion in the optical lattice mimics the motion without lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian of the lieb - liniger - mcguire  @xcite model with attractive interaction and an additional scattering - potential  @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 bright solitons  @xcite are well described by this model . for @xmath5 , exact eigenfunctions of this hamiltonian are known . solutions corresponding to @xmath0-particle solitons with momentum  @xmath6 read : @xmath7 where @xmath8    the corresponding energies are given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the ground state energy of the system  @xcite .",
    "as long as the kinetic energy is not too large , these states are separated from the first excited internal state ( which corresponds to one particle having left the soliton ) by a finite energy barrier  @xmath11 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    had the scattering potential been a function of the centre of mass of all @xmath0 particles ( @xmath12 ) , the situation would have been easy as the centre of mass and relative coordinates then still separate .",
    "however , the potential in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h ] ) is given by @xmath13 it would nevertheless be tempting to argue that , given the fact that the particles are tightly bound , they behave essentially as a single particle and one could thus approximate  @xmath14 by @xmath15 and thus @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the centre - of - mass coordinate .",
    "however , this approximation can give wrong results ( as will be shown towards the end of this paper ) and the mathematically justified  @xcite effective potential approach : @xmath18 has to be used .",
    "the effective potential is given by the convolution  @xcite @xmath19 this approach is valid for sufficiently well behaved potentials ( like a laser focus ) and for solitons which can not break apart for energetic reasons ( see the paragraph below eq .",
    "( [ eq : e0 ] ) ) .",
    "two - particle bound states in optical lattices are interesting both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically @xcite ; recently even three - particle bound states  @xcite have been investigated . within a bose - hubbard hamiltonian ,",
    "@xmath20 one can use _ exact _ eigen - states to do the numerics ( the restriction to negative pair interactions @xmath21 is not necessary , however the idea is to discuss a case close to the bright solitons created from attractive bose - einstein condensates ; the creation / annihilation operators of particles at lattice cite  @xmath22 are denoted by @xmath23/@xmath24 ) . rather than using the approach via green s functions of ref .",

    "@xcite along the lines of ref .",

    "the interaction energy of two particles sitting at the same lattice site is @xmath32 ; for the wavefunction to be normalisable for fixed centre of mass , @xmath33 ( which implies @xmath34 ) . to avoid a breaking of the dimer",
    ", the energy @xmath35 should be lower than two times the minimal possible energy of two particles : @xmath36 as for the single particle energy band , @xmath37 the dispersion relation for two particles approaches the free - particle behaviour in the limit @xmath38 which can thus be used to model particles not restricted by optical potentials : @xmath39 by choosing the parameters to approximate the dispersion relation for a two - particle `` soliton '' ( cf .",

    "@xcite is suggested to be a gaussian ( obtained by preparing the system in a swallow harmonic oscillator potential ) .",
    "if the system can be described within a centre - of - mass approximation , the expected result will always look similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : refl ] . for the initial gaussian to be realisable experimentally , the length scale on which the wavefunctions of the relative coordinates decays has to be smaller than the width of the initial wavefunction .",
    "given the fact that the dimer can not break into two free particles , this implies that in the final wavefunction measuring one particle on one side of the barrier would also lead to measuring the other particle on the same side - thus the final state indeed is a schrdinger cat state .",
    "figure  [ fig : three ] shows the result for a two - particle soliton scattered off a step potential , @xmath41 the initial wavefunction is constructed as a superposition of the eigen - solutions ( [ eq : eigenfunkt ] ) with @xmath42 which @xmath43 ensures the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bedb ] ) ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : zweisoliton ] ) ) : @xmath44 if  @xmath45 is not too small this leads to a gaussian centre - of - mass wavefunction initially centred at  @xmath46 .",
    "surprisingly , for the parameters chosen in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] the wavefunction splits into three rather than the expected two parts .",
    "if one of the particles was measured , the second would be much closer to the location of the first than the width of the three moving wave - packets .",

    "[ fig : three ] clearly demonstrates that the centre - of - mass approximation is not valid here : the effective potential  ( [ eq : veffend ] ) as displayed in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] at least qualitatively explains why resonances can occur which make parts the dimer wave - function stay at the potential .",
    "however , rather than being able to qualitatively understand the scattering behaviour , the effective potential approach can also be tested quantitatively for realistic scattering potentials .",
    "if the scattering potential is realised via the focus of a laser beam , the potential can be approximated by a gaussian or even the potential @xmath47 which is analytically solvable on the single particle level .",
    "figure  [ fig : miaou ]  a compares the wave - function after scattering for the exact potential @xmath48 the center of mass approximation @xmath49 and the effective potential  @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath43 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : betatilde ] ) .",
    "the effective potential clearly is a huge improvement over the center - of - mass approximation .",
    "it still remains to be shown that the final state indeed is entangled in the sense that whenever one measures one particle on the right ( left ) side , the other particle will be on the same side.to do this , a measure if an outgoing wave is unentangled , @xmath51 where the wavefunction is taken to be normalised to one .",
    "figure  [ fig : miaou ]  b demonstrates that for the wave - function to be entangled , the initial velocity can not be too large .",
    "experimental verifications that such states are indeed quantum superpositions could be done via interference experiments  @xcite .",
    "to summarise , scattering of bright quantum matter wave solitons  @xcite has been investigated for two attractive atoms in an optical lattice via exact numerics .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the beyond centre - of - mass approximation approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is indeed necessary to describe the physical situation at least qualitatively : the effective potential derived in ref .",
    "@xcite can explain the break - down of the centre - of - mass approximation observed for specific parameters in the numerics ( fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] ) .    for a scattering potential given by a laser focus ( the potential would then be approximately gaussian ) such an effect does not occur .",
    "the wavefunction then splits into two parts as shown for a single particle in fig .",
