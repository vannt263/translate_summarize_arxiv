    "in order to study harmonic fields in two dimensions , very powerful techniques have been developed based on complex analysis@xcite . among these , we will use in the following conformal maps , which allow to relate the geometry we wish to study ( i.e. a semi - infinite domain limited by a rough interface ) , to a regular one as schematically illustrated in figure ( [ fig : method ] ) .",
    "0.8 >     as usual , we will identify a point in the plane @xmath3 , with the complex number @xmath4 .",
    "we note @xmath5 the complex conjugate of @xmath6 . the two variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be treated as independent variables instead of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "a mapping from the complex plane onto itself is simply defined as a complex function @xmath10 of @xmath6 and @xmath7 which transforms one point of the complex plane @xmath6 into another point @xmath11 .",
    "for the mapping to be of physical interest it has to be bijective in a domain of interest , and thus inversible .",
    "the mapping is _ conformal _ if the function is _ holomorphic _ , i.e. it only depends on @xmath6 and not on @xmath7 .",
    "it can be shown that in this case , local angles are preserved in the transformation  apart from singular points  and hence the term `` conformal '' . moreover ,",
    "the real part and the imaginary part of any such holomorphic function are both harmonic , i.e. @xmath12 . the latter property results from the expression of the laplacian operator in terms of the variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 : @xmath13    two obvious choices are well suited for our geometry : i ) a semi - infinite plane @xmath14 , @xmath15 ii ) the unit circle @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "these two domains can be related by the transformation @xmath18 , and thus they are basically equivalent . since the boundary we consider is periodic in the @xmath8-direction , the mapping to the unit circle is well suited . however , in the following , we will rather use the mapping to the half - plane , since it corresponds directly to the `` reference '' problem where the roughness vanishes .",
    "the domain of interest , denoted by @xmath19 is limited by a rough interface @xmath20 which is a periodic function of @xmath21 of period @xmath22 . the conformal map , @xmath10 , is a function of @xmath6 which associate one point of the reference domain , @xmath14 or @xmath16 , to another point in @xmath19 . from now on in order to distinguish the initial and the image domain",
    ", we will note @xmath23 a point in the image plane , and keep the notation @xmath4 for the initial plane unless otherwise mentioned . before specifying the particular form of the boundary ,",
    "it is possible to guess an adequate form for these transformations .",
    "let us first consider the mapping from the half - plane @xmath14 to @xmath24 . as @xmath25 tends to @xmath26 , the mapping should approach the identity , @xmath27 , since the roughness of the boundary is not expected to play any significant role at a large distance ( compared to the period @xmath22 ) from the boundary .",
    "we introduce the function @xmath28 such that @xmath29 functions of the form @xmath30 with @xmath31 real , thus appears to be natural candidates for @xmath28 .",
    "they are indeed periodic functions of @xmath32 , and vanish exponentially as @xmath25 goes to @xmath26 when @xmath33 . moreover , in order to satisfy the same periodicity as @xmath20 we require that @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an integer .",
    "thus we propose as a writing of the transformation @xmath10 the following decomposition @xmath36 without loss of generality we will set @xmath37 for all the rest of this study .",
    "the rough boundary is to be identified with the image of the @xmath8 axis , so that @xmath20 obeys the parametric equations @xmath38    the corresponding transformation from the unit disk @xmath16 to the domain @xmath19 can be obtained from the above form ( [ map ] ) and the tranformation from the disk to the semi - infinite plane @xmath39",
    ". the resulting transformation reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 has been used . evidently , the image of the unit circle @xmath42 provides the same parametric form as ( [ boundary ] ) .",
    "the form of the transformation being imposed , one needs to check that the transformation is bijective : a point should have a single image , and an image point a unique parent .",
    "this condition does impose some restriction on the transformation @xmath10 .",
    "it can be rephrased simply for the transformation ( [ map ] ) as @xmath43 for all @xmath44 . in principle , it is sufficient to impose this condition only in the strict interior of the domain .",
    "if @xmath45 on the boundary , a kink may appear at this point . in the following , we will assume that the interface is smooth at a small scale so that poles are forbidden on the boundary .",
    "as an example , if the transformation is simply @xmath46 then the condition ( [ inversible ] ) reduces to @xmath47 or @xmath48 . for this maximum value ,",
    "the image of the @xmath8-axis is a cycloid , with cusp points .",
    "figure ( [ fi : cycloid ] ) illustrates this limit case .    0.8",
    "the above presented transformation is only useful for a particular application if the transformation @xmath10 can be computed , once the boundary @xmath20 is imposed .",
    "this section is devoted to this problem .",
    "the algorithm that we have developed generates the transformation very efficiently .",
    "different numerical techniques applied to computing the map from arbitrary closed domains to the unit disk can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "our algorithm can be shown to be related to the jacobi method used in these studies .",
    "we define the rough boundary @xmath20 as a single valued real function @xmath49 such that @xmath50 is the equation of the boundary . in other words ,",
    "the boundary is given by the parametrised form @xmath51 . to comply with the framework we have chosen here",
    ", we use in the following a 2@xmath52 -periodic @xmath49 .    from the particular form of the transformation @xmath10 , we expand the real and imaginary parts on the boundary @xmath20 @xmath53 \\\\",

    "we see that the coefficient @xmath56 can be computed from the fourier transform of @xmath57 .",
    "the difficulty is that @xmath58 is _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "however , we note that if the roughness is small enough , say of order @xmath59 , @xmath54 can be written as @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , identifying @xmath8 with @xmath54 is a zeroth order approximation . from the latter ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath61 can be computed by the fourier transform of @xmath62 .",
    "this provides a first order approximation of @xmath58 , from which an improved estimate of @xmath61 can be obtained , by taking the fourier transform of @xmath57 , i.e. a non - uniform sampling of the profile @xmath63 .",
    "iterating this scheme is the basis of our algorithm .",
    "we will omit for the time being the prerequisite on the amplitude of the roughness .",
    "we will return to this point by considering the stability of the algorithm .",
    "the intermediate quantities appearing at the @xmath31th iteration will be labelled with a superscript @xmath64 .",
    "we also formulate the algorithm directly in discrete terms suited for a numerical implementation . in the remainder of this article",
    ", all functions will be decomposed over a set of @xmath65 discrete values .",
    "the number of fourier modes will thus be limited to @xmath65 .",
    "we first introduce a series of sampling points @xmath66 with @xmath67 which is initially set to an arithmetic series @xmath68 .",
    "the sampling of @xmath62 by the @xmath66 gives the array @xmath69 the discrete fourier transform of this array is the complex valued array @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "the latter is shortly written as @xmath72\\ ] ] where @xmath73 denotes the fourier transform , which will be chosen as the fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm , thus imposing that @xmath35 is an integer power of 2 .",
    "the intermediate mapping @xmath74 is computed from the @xmath75 as @xmath76 the latter form is obtained from the identification of eq.([eqboom]b ) and the definition of @xmath75 , taking care of the fact that one sum is over positive index , while the other extends over the interval @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "then , one computes the series @xmath78 this linear transformation is shortly noted as @xmath79\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the above detailed transformation .",
    "the form of @xmath80 is dictated by eq.([eqboom]a ) for positive index , and from the fact that the inverse fourier transform of @xmath81 ( see below ) is real .",
    "the new sampling series is finally obtained from @xmath82   \\label{eqalgend}\\ ] ] the equations ( [ eqalgbeg]-[eqalgend ] ) define one step in the algorithm relating @xmath83 to @xmath74 .",
    "briefly we note this step @xmath84 .",
    "the searched function @xmath10 is clearly a fixed point of the transformation @xmath85 defined above in a discretized version .",
    "the uniqueness of the transformation @xmath10 results from that of the harmonic field in the domain @xmath19 with an equipotential condition on the boundary and a constant gradient perpendicular to the boundary at infinite distance from it . therefore",
    ", the only condition to consider is the stability of the fixed point .",
    "let us assume that we have an approximate solution of the transformation @xmath86 , from which we compute the series @xmath87 .",
    "all intermediate quantities computed from the exact solution are denoted by a superscript @xmath88 .",
    "following one complete iteration of the algorithm , we obtain the following expressions @xmath89 \\\\",
    "b = & b^*+{\\cal g}[a - a^ * ] \\\\   ( \\delta u)^{\\prime}= & { \\cal f}^{-1}[b - b^ * ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] where a taylor expansion of @xmath49 has been used to estimate the values of @xmath90 and where indices are omitted when unnecessary .",
    "the resulting difference @xmath91 after one cycle is thus @xmath92\\ ] ] let us introduce the norm @xmath93 parseval s theorem relates the above norm in real and fourier spaces according to @xmath94 in a similar fashion , the transformation @xmath80 does not affect the norm @xmath95 using the two previous results , we can estimate the norm of @xmath96 as @xmath97 therefore , if the absolute value of the slope of the objective profile satisfies , @xmath98 for all @xmath54 , then the fixed point @xmath99 is attractive for the transformation @xmath85 .",
    "it should however be noted that the number of modes @xmath35 should be large enough so that the perturbation @xmath100 should be small enough to legitimate the taylor expansion of @xmath49 used in the stability analysis .    in practice",
    ", the convergence is very fast provided the sufficient condition ( [ eqcondcv ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "moreover it has to be noted that one step in the algorithm requires a rather limited amount of computing time of order @xmath101 ( i.e. as for a fft operation ) . considering that this computation gives the solution of an harmonic problem in a semi - infinite domain",
    ", this cost appears to be extremely low .",
    "when our algorithm is applied to a simple monochromatic sine ( or cosine ) profile , @xmath102 , it turns out that as soon as the condition ( [ eqcondcv ] ) is violated ( i.e. @xmath103 ) the scheme is unstable , and a loop begins to appear around the origin where the slope exceeds 1 .",
    "thus the sufficient condition is also a necessary condition .",
    "the limit @xmath104 can simply be broken if one uses an under - relaxation scheme .",
    "the optimum determination of the under - relaxation parameter , or the use of other algorithms can be found in ref.@xcite for mapping arbitrary domains on the unit disk .",
    "the transposition of these algorithms to our problem can be worked out in details .",
    "other ways to break this limit is to decompose the transformation @xmath105 in two ( or more ) substeps .",
    "suppose one could map the real axis onto an intermediate profile using a first transformation @xmath106 and then the intermediate profile onto the objective one using a second transformation @xmath107 .",
    "the combination of the two transformations @xmath108 is then the searched mapping . by breaking the problem into two steps , it is possible that each step can be handled by the above presented algorithm , while the combination of the two giving a profile having a slope larger than unity .",
    "the difficulty here is to device a suited intermediate step .",
    "one could consider for example filtering the initial objective profile so that the filtered profile may fulfill the slope constraint .",
    "we did not investigate this extension any further .",
    "we present in the following calculations of conformal transformations associated with a simple sine interface .",
    "we will use a norm on the error similar to the one introduced in the previous subsection .",
    "the distance @xmath109 between the objective profile and the calculated one is defined as follows : @xmath110 ^ 2 dx\\ ] ] it is convenient to make this distance dimensionless , normalising it by the amplitude of the profile , @xmath111 where the objective profile has the equation @xmath102 .",
    "it is worth noting that the problem is far from being as simple as it might appear on the surface . in real space",
    "one single fourier mode is sufficient to entirely characterise the interface .",
    "the transformation @xmath10 however requires much more modes .",
    "figure ( [ fi : pssine ] ) shows the power spectrum of the @xmath112 series , for different amplitudes @xmath113 .    0.7",
    "the convergence of the algorithm is shown at play on figure ( [ fi : cvsine ] ) , where the obtained profile obtained after the first few iterations are shown . in this particular example @xmath114 and",
    "the number of modes is 32 .",
    "0.7     the importance of allowing for enough fourier modes is also illustrated by considering the minimum error @xmath109 obtained as a function of @xmath35 as shown in figure ( [ fi : ersine ] ) .",
    "( for this particular study we did not resort to a fft algorithm to handle any value of @xmath35 ) . for @xmath114",
    "we observe that about 20 modes are necessary to reach the single precision used in the computation .",
    "as the amplitude increases , the number of modes needed to reach a small enough error becomes larger and larger .",
    "in the description of rough surfaces and interfaces , some recent progress has been achieved by recognising some scaling invariance properties which has been observed in a number of real surfaces , and has been shown to result naturally in a number of growth models .",
    "recent reviews@xcite have covered this field .    due to the different roles played by the directions normal and parallel to the surface , the scaling invariance  when applicable ",
    "involves different scale factors depending on orientation , a property called self - affinity .",
    "we consider here only two dimensional media so that the boundary is self - affine if it remains ( statistically ) invariant under the transformation @xmath115 for all values of @xmath116 .",
    "the exponent @xmath117 is called the `` hurst '' or roughness exponent .",
    "it is characteristic of the scaling invariance . from this property , we derive easily that @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a prefactor .    it is noteworthy that the self - affinity property does not involve the scaling of any measure .",
    "however , studying the scaling of the length of the curve , two regimes are revealed . for large distances , larger than a scale @xmath120 ,",
    "the curvilinear length of the profile is simply proportional to the projected length along the @xmath8 axis , hence on can identify a trivial fractal dimension equal to 1 . on the other hand , for distances smaller than @xmath120 , the arc length scales in a non - trivial fashion with the projected length .",
    "this allows to define a fractal dimension equal to @xmath121 .",
    "the cross - over scale @xmath116 between these two regimes is such that the typical slope of the profile is 1 , i.e. using the notations of eq.([eqsa ] ) , @xmath122    once a roughness profile has been measured , a very convenient way @xcite to check the self - affinity is to compute the power spectral density ( psd ) of the profile . in the case of a self - affine profile of exponent @xmath117 , the psd is expected to have the following behaviour : @xmath123    it is important to stress that the approach developed in this article is not specific to self - affine boundaries .",
    "however , being given the practical importance of such boundaries , and the expected generality of scaling results , we will essentially focus on self - affine boundaries as practical applications of the concepts developed in the framework of harmonic field in the vicinity of rough boundaries .    in view of the form of the transformation @xmath10 , and of the previous scaling , eq.([eqsaps ] ) , we introduce a particular set of transformation : let us choose @xmath124 where @xmath125 are random gaussian variable with 0 mean and unit variance for the real and imagnary part independently , we can write @xmath126 = 1 + a. \\mathop{\\im m } \\left [ \\sum_k \\epsilon_k k^{1/2 - \\zeta } e^{-ikx } \\right]\\ ] ] then for a given set of @xmath125 , we can define a maximum amplitude such that the mapping is bijective : @xmath127}}}\\ ] ] this method gives a short way to generate directly @xmath10 transforms which image the real axis to a self - affine interface shape .",
    "this approach is useful to study generic properties of self - affine boundaries .",
    "when the amplitude @xmath113 is small enough , @xmath128 , and thus the series @xmath61 is equal to the fourier transform of the profile .",
    "the transformation @xmath10 sends the real axis onto a periodic function whose power - spectrum is of the form eq.([eqsaps ] ) .",
    "when the amplitude increases , the first iteration of the algorithm turns out to be rather approximative . in order to show that the power spectrum of @xmath61 is not significantly altered by further steps , we show in figure ( [ fi : pssyntsa ] ) the power spectrum of @xmath61 as compared to the initial zeroth order approximation .",
    "the result have been obtained from an average over 100 profiles with 2048 modes each .",
    "we see that the synthetic generation of the transform does not modify the power spectrum of @xmath112 coefficients .    0.7     therefore",
    ", we can directly generate mappings @xmath112 which will transform the real axis into a periodic boundary which is self - affine with any prescribed roughness exponent for distances smaller than the period .",
    "such a construction may appear as artificial in the sense that the rough boundary is not imposed but on the contrary it results from the choice of the mapping .",
    "it is however useful , as will be shown later , because it allows to study generic properties of harmonic fields close to self - affine boundaries .",
    "the alternative way consists in using the mapping construction algorithm .",
    "we have in a previous section analysed the convergence of the algorithm applied to the special case of a sine profile .",
    "we now consider the case of a self - affine boundary in a similar fashion .",
    "this interface has been calculated in the real space with 64 modes , and we have used 256 modes in the conformal transformation . the standard deviation of the height distribution is called @xmath129 .",
    "the chosen @xmath117 exponent chosen for this example is @xmath130 . from eq.([eqampmax ] ) , we note that the maximum amplitude decreases as the number of modes @xmath35 increases .",
    "this is natural since as the lower cut - off in the scaling regime decreases , the self - affine function will tend toward a continuous but non - differentiable curve when @xmath131 .",
    "the distribution of local slopes is indeed expected to gets wider and wider as the number of modes increases .",
    "quantitatively , @xmath132 .",
    "it is to be noted that as @xmath35 increases , the standard deviation of the height @xmath129 does not increase .",
    "it is to be noted that these conclusions are drawn under the hypothesis that the longest wavelength remains fixed , here set to @xmath133 . alternatively , if the smaller cut - off and the amplitude of the corresponding mode were kept constant while increasing the number of modes , then the maximum amplitude would remain constant .    as in the previous example ( sine profile )",
    ", we can observe on figure ( [ fi : exsyntsa ] ) an example of the conformal map obtained for @xmath134 , where the maximum standard deviation that could be handled by the algorithm without diverging is @xmath135 .",
    "we can see on this figure that the major differences between the objective and calculated profiles occur in areas where the local slope is maximum . for roughness amplitude greater than the convergence threshold",
    ", one can see loops appearing in these areas .",
    "the convergence speed , the sensitivity to the number of modes allowed in the determination of @xmath10 , the evolution of the minimum error , ... behaved for these self - affine profiles in a similar qualitative way as for the simple sine profile .    0.7",
    "in the following , we show that the knowledge of such a conformal transformation allows to solve immediatly harmonic problems .",
    "we essentially focus here on the case where the field is assumed to be uniform far from the boundary .",
    "this is a typical case as soon as the roughness is of small amplitude .",
    "this can be seen as an asymptotic expansion focusing here on the small scale details of the interface , whereas the matching with the far field can be done using a field whose variation is small on the scale of the roughness amplitude .",
    "we will now focus on two problems : perfectly conducting boundary so that the potential gradient is normal to the boundary , and perfectly insulating boundary where the potential gradient is parallel to the surface .",
    "since we know how to taylor mappings which image the real axis on a generic self - affine boundary , this gives us a key to consider the scaling features of harmonic fields in the vicinity of self - affine boundaries .",
    "harmonic fields are encountered very frequently in nature .",
    "linear transport involving scalar fields @xmath136 , where the flux @xmath137 is proportional to the field gradient plus a conservation law in the absence of sources , and in steady conditions , @xmath138 , imply the harmonic nature of the field @xmath136 , @xmath139 .",
    "heat diffusion obeying fourier s law , gives an harmonic temperature field in steady condition .",
    "mass diffusion with fick s law is a similar example with the concentration field .",
    "electric conduction with ohm s law , viscous flow in confined two dimensional hele - shaw cells , vorticity in stokes flow , ... constitutes a partial list of possible applications .      in this part , for the sake of concreteness",
    ", we use the case of thermal conduction .",
    "we are interested in the temperature field @xmath140 in the region @xmath19 limited by the rough interface @xmath20 .",
    "let us first consider the case of a perfectly conducting interface , so that @xmath141 for each point of the boundary .",
    "we impose in the far field a homogeneous unit flux of heat .",
    "the problem to solve is @xmath142    the knowledge of @xmath10 allows then to define @xmath143 , image field of @xmath140 in the smooth domain @xmath14 : @xmath144 .",
    "as @xmath145 and @xmath146 in @xmath14 , the resolution of ( [ eqpblap ] ) in @xmath19 is thus equivalent to : @xmath147    the frontier @xmath148 being the real axis , we have immediately the solution in @xmath14 : @xmath149 and then the solution in @xmath19 is : @xmath150\\ ] ]    figure ( [ fi : isotherm ] ) shows a set of isotherm curves close to a self - affine isotherm boundary .",
    "these lines become smoother and smoother when the distance to the electrode increases .",
    "the morphology of these isotherm lines have some interesting features .",
    "if @xmath151 denotes the distance to the boundary , one can observe from the form of the mapping @xmath10 that modes with a wavelength smaller than @xmath151 will be damped whereas longer wavelength modes will only be slightly decreased .",
    "therefore , the isotherm curves will be similar to the profile up to a low pass filtering .",
    "in the case of a self - affine boundary , the isotherms will preserve the self - affine character with the same exponent , but their lower cut - off will increase as the distance to the actual boundary , up to the distance of order of the largest wavelength .    0.7",
    "let us now study the temperature gradient .",
    "quite generally , we can write the gradient in the complex plane as @xmath152    from the expression of the temperature field , we have @xmath153 from the expression of the function @xmath112 , we see that at a large distance from the rough boundary , the term @xmath154 vanishes exponentially",
    ". therefore , one recovers the imposed condition for the temperature at infinity i.e. @xmath155 .    on figure ( [ fi : hgrat ] ) we have presented on the same graph the profile of a rough electrode and the modulus of the temperature gradient .",
    "one may see quite easily that the field is very large ( small ) in the deepest ( highest ) areas .",
    "this field depends naturally both on the local topography and on its remote environment .",
    "the connection between the field and the local topography can be analysed through cross - correlations as will be done in a following section .",
    "0.7     the perfectly insulating boundary is the other archetypical problem whose expression is @xmath156 the solution to this problem can simply be obtained from the previous using duality properties of the harmonic field .",
    "the real part of the previous solution gives the answer to the problem .",
    "@xmath157\\ ] ] the temperature gradient is then simply @xmath158      we have seen previously that once we know the conformal mapping able to transplant the half complex plane @xmath159 onto the rough domain @xmath160 , we have immediatly the solution of the electrical potential near the rough electrode @xmath161 . if the roughness amplitude remains below the convergence threshold , we are now able to solve this problem for any kind of boundary . in practice , very often , one does not worry about the details of the rough interface .",
    "as we have seen most perturbations die away from the boundary exponentially fast .",
    "therefore , knowing the longest wavelength of the boundary gives the scale away from the boundary where the field becomes homogeneous .",
    "this means practically , that if one is interested only in the far field , one could replace the rough interface by a straight one so that the far field is unperturbed .",
    "the question we want to address in this section is the following : where should the `` equivalent '' straight interface be located so as to match the asymptotic far field ?",
    "a zeroth order guess is to place it at the geometrical average of the height distribution .",
    "this will be shown not be an exact answer , in the following , we call @xmath162 the distance between the equivalent position and the geometrical average .    in order to illustrate the problem , let us imagine the following experiment .",
    "let us consider an electrolytic bath , where the electrical field is homogeneous between two opposite electrodes @xmath113 and @xmath163 at a distance @xmath164 from each other .",
    "the electrical resistance @xmath165 of the set - up is measured .",
    "then , as illustrated in figure ( [ fi : elect ] ) we place in the middle of the bath and parallel to the electrodes a rough plane @xmath119 of negligible thickness which is a good conductor , so that it can be considered as an equipotential .",
    "we measure again the electrical resistance of the set - up , which is now reduced to @xmath166 .",
    "what is the value of @xmath167 ?",
    "so as to answer this question , we part the system in two , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "each of these two problems corresponds to the situation described in the introduction of this section . extrapolating the field from electrode @xmath113",
    ", we find an offset @xmath170 .",
    "similarly from @xmath163 we obtain a different offset @xmath171 , so that , ignoring the details of the perturbed field in the vicinity of @xmath119 , the rough electrode will appear as being equivalent to a plane electrode of thickness @xmath172 .",
    "this `` electrical thickness '' has nothing to do with the real thickness of the plane considered here to be zero .",
    "if the rough electrode has the shape of a sine function , of amplitude @xmath113 and wavelength @xmath116 we will argue below that @xmath173 . finally it is a simple matter to relate the resistance drop to this effective thickness through @xmath174 .    0.7     we now revert to the notation of the previous paragraph , and deal with the temperature instead of the voltage . for distances away from the rough boundary much greater than @xmath133 , ( our longest wavelength ) ,",
    "all exponential terms die out , and hence the far - field can be written @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the constant term in the function @xmath112 .",
    "the off - set position of the equivalent isotherm is thus @xmath177    let us first analyse the problem for a small amplitude sine boundary of amplitude @xmath113 and wavelength @xmath116 .",
    "the offset @xmath162 in the location of the equivalent straight boundary is to be normalised by @xmath113 to obtain a dimensionless quantity .",
    "the latter should be a function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath178 .",
    "taylor expansion of this function provides the perturbation expansion @xmath179 a simple argument allows to simplify the latter equation .",

    "<S> the aim of this study is to analyze the properties of harmonic fields in the vicinity of rough boundaries where either a constant potential or a zero flux is imposed , while a constant field is prescribed at an infinite distance from this boundary . </S>",

    "<S> defining and computing effective properties of heterogeneous media is a subject which has been studied for a long time , and for which a number of powerful techniques have been developped . in most cases however , the heterogeneities are considered to lie in the bulk of the material . </S>",
    "<S> another type of inhomogeneity is due to the random geometry of the surface on which boundary conditions are applied . </S>",
    "<S> this study focusses on this second type </S>",
    "<S> . we will thus consider _ homogeneous media _ which are limited by a rough surface or interface . </S>",
    "<S> our purpose here is to introduce a very efficient way of solving harmonic problems in two - dimensional systems for any geometry of the boundary .    </S>",
    "<S> the occurence of rough interfaces in nature is more the general rule than the exception . </S>",
    "<S> apart from very specific cases such as mica where a careful cleavage can produce planar surfaces at the atomic scale , surfaces are rough . </S>",
    "<S> even glass with a very homogeneous composition , where the surface is obtained by a slow cooling of the material , so that surface tension can act effectively to smoothen all irregularities , does display roughness in the range 5 to 50 nanometers over a window of a few micrometers width@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the so - called `` mirror '' fracture surface which is optically smooth exhibits specific topographic patterns when examined with an atomic force microscope@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the key question is thus to identify the relevant range of scales at which roughness appears . from common observations </S>",
    "<S> , this question may not admit a simple clear cut answer . indeed in a variety of cases </S>",
    "<S> , the amplitude of the roughness appears to be strongly dependent on the size of the examined surface . </S>",
    "<S> a particular class of such scale dependent roughness , namely _ self - affine roughness_@xcite , has recently motivated a lot of activity ( see references @xcite for recent reviews ) both because of its relevance in many different instances , and of their theoretical justification which has been obtained in statistical physics for a wide class of models ranging from growth models@xcite , molecular beam epitaxy@xcite , fracture surfaces@xcite , to immiscible fluid interfaces@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the present study is not specific to self - affine surfaces , we shall consider this particular class in order to apply our method . </S>",
    "<S> the interest of this choice being that _ </S>",
    "<S> i ) _ the description of the roughness is realistic for a number of applications , _ ii ) _ consequences can be expressed in quite general terms as a function of few parameters directly accessible experimentally , and finally _ iii ) _ </S>",
    "<S> the most commonly studied roughness models are `` monochromatic '' surfaces with a single asperity pattern repeated periodically , and hence the transposition to more complex geometries may reveal wrong ( examples of such cases will be explicited in the main body of this article ) .    </S>",
    "<S> as previously mentioned , if most surfaces are rough , this roughness may be of small amplitude macroscopically , and thus one may feel that its role can be neglected in most cases . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , this is generally true . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account precisely the surface roughness may be required in two distinct classes of problems :    the first class ( i ) covers applications where the roughness can not be neglected at the scale at which the bulk field varies . for obvious reasons , there is no way to avoid the accurate description of the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> we may mention the following potential applications : @xmath0 in confined geometries , such as naturally encountered in surface force study , the roughness of the surface may affect the interpretation and thus the precision of the measurements since the distance between two facing surfaces is generally estimated from indirect measurements of transport in the gap between the surfaces.@xcite @xmath0 field which are rapidly varying in space will be sensitive to fine details of the boundary geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the most obvious example in this field is the reflection and scattering of a wave by a rough boundary.@xcite of particular importance is the case of surface waves , evanescent waves , rayleigh waves in elasticity , ... </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 in a similar spirit , diffusion processes may display anomalous behaviors at short times where the diffusion length is smaller or comparable to the roughness.@xcite    the second class of problems ( ii ) where roughness can not be neglected is when one has to focus on the boundary , either because only this part matters for extraneous reasons or because the system is sensitive to high fields which can be induced by the roughness itself . </S>",
    "<S> some examples of these two cases are listed below : @xmath0 surface phenomenon such as electrofiltration requires a proper solution of say a stokes flow field , in the immediate vicinity ( typically debye length scale ) of a rough boundary where an electric boundary layer is present and can be entrained by the fluid to give rise to an electric current in response to a fluid flow in a porous medium.@xcite @xmath0 the brittle fracture of glass is generally due to surface defects which induce locally high stresses , which reduce significantly the breaking limit of this material . in the absence of specific surface degradation the most important source of surface defect is the topography itself@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 some growth models have a local growth rate which depends on a harmonic field locally . </S>",
    "<S> the development of unstable modes which will finally induce a macroscopic roughening does require the proper analysis of the field at the surface.@xcite    the relative independence of the bulk field on the small scale roughness of the boundary for a slowly varying field ( class ii problems ) can be used to explore the local field close to the boundary using an asymptotic analysis with a double scale technique . </S>",
    "<S> the large scale problem consists in solving the problem at hand replacing the rough boundary by a smooth equivalent one . </S>",
    "<S> the small scale problem deals with the details of the rough boundary and matches at `` infinity''with a homogeneous field . </S>",
    "<S> this local problem will be considered in full details in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> these examples are obviously not exhaustive . </S>",
    "<S> inhomogeneous boundary conditions may arise for instance in contact problems where the roughness can not be neglected.@xcite one may also consider application outside the realm of physical applications , such as the use of harmonic problems and particularly conformal map for providing a simple means of meshing a domain limited by a rough boundary .    in the present article we will essentially focus on harmonic problems . </S>",
    "<S> the latter arise in a variety of different domains in physics , such as electrostatics , thermal or concentration diffusion , flow in porous media , anti - plane elasticity to mention a few . </S>",
    "<S> another use of conformal mappings is the resolution of bi - harmonic problems near a rough interface ; both stress field in elasticity and velocity field in low reynolds number fluid mechanics@xcite can be derived from potentials that obey such bi - laplacian equations . </S>",
    "<S> we refer the reader to the companion paper which is completely devoted to this specific problem .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is devoted to the study of harmonic problems in 2d semi - infinite media limited by a rough boundary . to extend the definition of the profile of the boundary to infinity </S>",
    "<S> , we use periodic boundary conditions along the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> although very specific , this type of geometry will be very convenient as soon as no other boundary lies close to the first one . </S>",
    "<S> the distance threshold to consider in such a case is typically of the order of magnitude of the larger spatial wavelength of the profile _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the spatial period in the geometry we have described . </S>",
    "<S> we use a conformal mapping technique . </S>",
    "<S> it consists in contructing a map from the domain of interest ( in the complex plane ) onto a regular semi - plane . </S>",
    "<S> the conformity of the map allows to preserve harmonicity through the map transform .    in a first part of this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we define the form of the conformal mapping suited to our geometry . then </S>",
    "<S> , we adress the question of constructing the mapping associated with any prescribed interface . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this problem can be solved with an iterative algorithm using fast fourier transforms ( fft ) . </S>",
    "<S> this algorithm allows to get the conformal map in a few iterations of fft , whose computation time scales as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of fourier modes used to describe the interface . </S>",
    "<S> note the remarquable efficiency of such a technique , considering that the map gives the solution of a laplacian field in the entire two - dimensional problem . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is very close to the so - called `` theodorsen problem '' @xcite in a circular geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that one can generate maps which naturally give rise to self - affine boundaries , a powerful technique to explore generic properties of such problems . </S>",
    "<S> specific applications of this technique to self - affine profile are studied , which includes _ </S>",
    "<S> i ) _ the question of defining an equivalent smooth ( planar ) interface , and finding its height compared to the geometrical average height of the interface , _ ii ) _ the correlation between the height and the field which is computed exactly in the limit of a small roughness amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> these two examples demonstrate the unexpected difference in behaviors for persistent and anti - persistent profiles . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we give the expression of the green function for localized flux on a rough interface . </S>"
