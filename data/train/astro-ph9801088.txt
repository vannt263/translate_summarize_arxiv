    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrum of seyfert galaxies is dominated by a quasi - thermal component ( shields 1978 , malkan & sargent 1982 , malkan 1983 ) which extends into the soft x - ray band ( walter & fink 1993 ) .",
    "although this feature is usually interpreted as thermal emission from a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk around a supermassive black hole , recent observations cast doubt on this simple explanation .",
    "a disconinuity at the lyman edge , either in emission or absorption , seems to be a generic feature of theoretical models of accretion disks ( blaes 1998 ) .",
    "however , partial absorption features have been detected in @xmath2 of observed agns ( antonucci , kinney & ford 1989 , koratkar , kinney & bohlin 1992 ) .",
    "recently , iwasawa , ( 1996 ) detected extremely broad iron k-@xmath3 line emission from the seyfert galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "they interpret this emission as x - rays reflected by an accretion disk extending to 1.23 @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , of the central black hole . for a stable accretion disk to exist this close to the central black hole this black hole must be rotating close to its maximal value ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "the appearance of an accretion disk around a maximally rotating kerr black hole is very different than that of a disk around a non - rotating hole .",
    "the effective temperature of the disk is larger .",
    "the material in the disk orbits the hole at higher velocities , increasing the range of doppler boosts of the disk radiation .",
    "finally , the emitted radiation has to escape from a deeper potential well , which causes larger redshifts .    in this paper",
    ", we compute the observed spectrum of a viscously heated accretion disk around a maximally rotating supermassive black hole .",
    "the rest frame spectrum of radiation emitted by the disk is computed using the code developed by sincell & krolik ( 1998 ) .",
    "the observed disk spectrum is calculated using a ray - tracing program which we describe in the next section .",
    "the photon equations of motion in a kerr metric are derived from the lagrangean @xmath6 using the geodesic equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an affine parameter and @xmath9 indicates the coordinate of interest : @xmath10 .",
    "expressions for the metric components , @xmath11 are given by bardeen , ( 1972 ) for boyer - linquist coordinates .",
    "equation [ eq : lagrangean eq motion ] expands to eight first - order coupled differential equations for the four space coordinates and the four components of the photon momentum .",
    "this equation set can be reduced to six first - order equations by noting that the photon energy @xmath12 and angular momentum parallel to the symmetry access @xmath13 where @xmath14 , are conserved along a null geodesic .",
    "it is possible to reduce the equation set further ( see bardeen , 1972 , cunningham 1975 , agol 1997 ) but this introduces complicated bookkeeping into the ray - tracing calculation .",
    "the differential equations are integrated with a fourth - order runge - kutta routine ( press , 1992 ) .",
    "there is one additional constant of the motion @xmath15\\ ] ] which is needed to specify a particular photon geodesic . in this equation",
    ", @xmath16 is the black hole spin parameter and @xmath17 in boyer - lindquist coordinates .    to compute the observed spectrum , we choose a particular inclination angle and a grid in the impact parameters @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 , which is measured in units of @xmath4 , is defined as the projected distance away from the black hole along an axis perpendicular to the spin axis of the black hole .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is the projected distance parallel to the spin axis .",
    "the range of values for the impact parameters corresponds roughly to the inner and outermost radii of the accretion disk .    for each pair of impact parameters , the constants of motion of the corresponding geodesic",
    "are defined @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the equations of motion are then integrated inward from @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the mass of the black hole and we adopt geometrized units , and @xmath25 .",
    "the integration is stopped when the geodesic either hits the disk ( @xmath26 ) , escapes to infinity or is captured by the black hole .    for a geodesic",
    "which intersects the disk at radius @xmath27 , we can compute two important quantities : the total redshift of a photon emitted by the disk at @xmath27 and escaping to infinity @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the frequency of the emitted and observed photon , and the angle at which the photon leaves the disk , @xmath30 , measured in the rest frame of the orbiting material .",
    "explicit equations for these quantities can be found in cunningham ( 1975 ) .",
    "the observed spectrum is found by integrating the emitted intensity over the impact parameters of all the geodesics which reach the observer @xmath31 where the factor @xmath32 arises from the invariance of the photon occupation number and @xmath33 is the spectral intensity of the radiation emitted by the disk .",
    "for example , the intensity could be described by an analytic expression for the reflected iron line as a function of radius or a grid of numerical models of the continuum flux from an optically thick accretion disk .",
    "in figure [ fig : continuum ] , we plot the uv continuum of an optically thick accretion disk around a maximally rotating black hole . the black hole is assumed to have a mass of @xmath34 and to accrete matter at @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the eddington critical accretion rate .",
    "the three curves represent three different values of the disk inclination angle , @xmath37 .",
    "we find that the lyman edge discontinuity is unobservable when @xmath38 , but that a significant absorption feature remains at smaller inclinations .",
    "if this model is typical of all accretion disks , then we would predict that lyman edge features should be seen in @xmath39 of all agns .",
    "this is obviously only a very rough estimate , but it does indicate that black hole rotation is a plausible means of erasing the lyman discontinuity in a large fraction of agns ."
