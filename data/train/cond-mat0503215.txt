    "thermodynamics approach for weakly excited gm .",
    "they studied vibrated gm under gravity , and mapped the non - equilibrium system with a spinless fermion - like theory .",
    "the important point is that by focusing on the configurational properties of an excluded volume ( hole ) theory , the gm non - equilibrium steady state can be understood in terms of a configurational ( maximum principle ) fermi - like distribution .",
    "many interesting questions concerning the complex system of gm are still open , i.e. , _ the _ stochastic motion @xmath4 of the fluidized particles is not entirely known @xcite .",
    "for example it is important to test whether the realization spectrum , @xmath5 behaves as a brownian motion ( @xmath6 ) , or it has a more complex behavior related to a cooperative dynamics .",
    "therefore an analysis of the stochastic realization @xmath4 of these _ macroscopic _ fermi - like particles ( _ m_fp ) should be made . in this letter",
    "we report some results concerning the analysis of these _ m_fp , in particular we have measured these realizations @xmath4 and from their fourier ( fft ) analysis we conclude that @xmath7 with @xmath8 , ( where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the amplitude and @xmath11 the frequency of the bed oscillations ) , showing an agreement with our phenomenological ( langevin ) memory - like stochastic differential equation ( sde ) approach .    a sinusoidal vibration is driven by a vibration plate on the gm bed . the vibration apparatus is set up by an electromagnetic shaker [ tiravib@xmath12 , which allows for feedback through a piezoelectric accelerometer ( pcb)@xcite . this allow us the control of the frequency @xmath13 and the acceleration in the range of @xmath14hz to @xmath15hz , and @xmath16 to @xmath17 respectively , where @xmath18 is the acceleration of gravity . the control loop is completed by an oscillator lab - works sc@xmath19 and a tira@xmath20/z amplifier of @xmath21kw .",

    "complementary , one minute films of this fluidized 3d gap were taking by using a video camera microscope ( cvm ) .",
    "for the propose of this work the cvm was only used to identify qualitatively the different dynamical regimes of the @xmath23 balls , in fact the recorded movies were only used to discuss the physical meaning of the measured @xmath4 registers and their corresponding realization spectra @xmath59 .",
    "these measurements at @xmath41 are a partial research of a large work on progress we carried out with @xmath60 .",
    "when the input of energy is large the individual motion of the beads looks erratic , in this section we will analyze the frequency spectrum of the stochastic realizations @xmath4 of the _ m_fp at the fluidized gap .",
    "we remark that in this report we will not be concerned in a regime where the input of energy is so small that the power spectrum can be described by a feigenbaun scenario @xcite .",
    "consider a given stochastic process ( sp ) @xmath61 .",
    "then under quite general conditions if the characteristic function of the sp @xmath61 ( fourier transform of the probability distribution @xmath62 $ ] ) obeys the _ asymptotic _ scaling @xcite : @xmath63 which means that the sp @xmath61 fulfills in distribution the scaling @xmath64 then , the spectrum density behaves asymptotically like @xmath65    now let us apply this result to a langevin - like particle . consider the case when the velocity @xmath66 and the position @xmath4 of the particle are described by the sde @xmath67 when @xmath68 is a gaussian colored noise .",
    "this sde corresponds to the alternative treatment of brownian motion , in fact initiated by langevin @xcite .",
    "this colored noise case corresponds to a weak non - markovian process @xcite . from ( [ s3 ] ) and ( [ s1 ] ) we obtain , in the overdamped case ( brownian motion ) @xmath69 ( limit @xmath70 . on the contrary , in the undamped free motion case ( random accelerations model ) we obtain @xmath71 ( limit @xmath72 ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the case when the correlation of the noise @xmath68 in ( [ s3 ] ) is of the _ long - range _ type @xmath73 with@xmath74 ( perhaps describing a complex fluid surrounding our _ test _ particle ) , the sp @xmath4 turns out to be a _",
    "strong _ non - markovian process @xcite , i.e. , there is no fokker - planck asymptotic regime .",
    "then we get for the spectrum in the overdamped case @xmath75 and in the undamped case @xmath76    for the particular situation when the ensemble of _ m_fp can not be represented by a _",
    "single _ particle in a `` fluid '' ( langevin - like particle ) we should leave the regular stochastic calculus and introduce a _ fractional _ temporal differential operator to emulate the complex multiple particle collisions and particle motion",
    ". then we model the gm system by a fractional langevin equation of the form @xcite @xmath77 -v_{0}\\frac{t^{-\\alpha } } { \\gamma ( 1-\\alpha ) } = -\\gamma ^{\\alpha } v(t)+\\xi ( t),\\text { and}\\ \\frac{dz}{dt}=v(t),\\ \\alpha > 0 ,   \\label{s9}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is a gaussian white noise .",
    "so , asymptotically in the undamped limit , @xmath78 we get @xmath79 which means that @xmath80 then using @xmath81it follows@xmath82 which is the desired result to fit our experiments when friction and collisions between the gm particles are important issues , and can not be represented by a memory - like brownian model as in eq.([s7 ] ) , nor by using the memory - like random acceleration model as in eq.([s8 ] ) .",
    "the general case given in eq.([s9 ] ) by keeping arbitrary the friction coefficient @xmath83 and for any noise @xmath68 and correlation @xmath84 can also be solved in a similar way @xcite .",
    "as function of @xmath85 , the circles correspond to one steel ball , full - squares to one steel ball with rotation , and triangles to nine steel balls in a @xmath2 array .",
    "typical log - log power spectrum for one steel ball ( b - c ) and nine steel balls ( d ) in a 1d array.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ] +    in fig.2(a ) we show the velocity squared dispersion @xmath86 against the amplitude - dispersion @xmath85 of the realizations of the _ m_fp corresponding to the @xmath2 array of @xmath87 mm steel balls vibrated vertically ; for weak amplitude the slope @xmath88 shows a linear behavior .",
    "fig.2(a ) shows three experiments , the first corresponds to _ one steel ball _ vertically jumping in a cylinder of @xmath27 mm ( almost elastic case ) with @xmath89 see fig.2(b ) , and gives the slope @xmath90 ( in accord with the conservation of energy : @xmath91 ) .",
    "the second experiment is _",
    "one steel ball _ jumping in a wider cylinder ( @xmath28 mm ) , in this case the slope gives @xmath92 indicating a dissipative mechanism , here typically @xmath93 see fig.2(c ) .",
    "the wider cylinder permits the rotation of the steel ball , probably due to the interaction with the air gap between the steel ball and the wall . in the third experiment",
    "there are _ nine steel balls _ in the wider cylinder , in this case the many - body collisions came into account giving a smaller slope @xmath94 , here @xmath95 see fig.2(d ) ( we find that for @xmath55hz@xmath96hz , the exponent is @xmath97 ) .",
    "this last result indicates that in this regime it is necessary to introduce a description in terms of a non usual collision operator . the estimated slope @xmath98 gives a qualitative magnitude from which it is possible to observe a clear tendency in the gm motion behavior .",
    "spectral density measurements [ corresponding to the geometry of fig.1(a ) ] associated to the realization @xmath4 of @xmath99 balls are shown in fig.3 ( a - c ) . in fig.3(d )",
    "the plot of the exponent @xmath100 against the excitation frequency @xmath13 for a fixed acceleration @xmath41 is shown . for @xmath101hz ,",
    "the balls are organized in a `` lattice '' ( we test this fact by using a vcm at the surface of the gm bed ) where the weak - vibration movement of each ball is limited to a site of this lattice , given therefore a wiener realization @xmath4 . note that for @xmath41 and @xmath101hz the excitation amplitude is @xmath102 m , so we do not expect _ hopping motion _ from one to another site .",
    "it is interesting to remark that even when the figures @xmath103 and @xmath104 for the zirconia - ytria balls are similar to the one from the experiment with only one steel ball ( for @xmath34 and @xmath33hz ) , in the present case the stochastic behavior is quite different as can be corroborated from the value of @xmath105 , when it is compared with the one form fig.2(b - c ) .     balls in a glass container as in fig.1(a ) , for @xmath41 and different excitation frequency @xmath106 ( a ) @xmath107hz , ( b ) @xmath108hz , ( c ) @xmath109hz .",
    "( d ) the power spectrum exponent @xmath100 against the excitation frequency @xmath13 is shown.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ] +    for @xmath13 approximately between @xmath47hz and @xmath110hz , the `` hopping '' of the fluidized balls ( jumping to unoccupied hole - states ) are more frequently , thus leading to exponents @xmath100 from @xmath111 to @xmath112 .",
    "this is a generalized brownian motion from low to high correlation , see eq.([s7 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath113 is reached we observe a pure `` hopping '' mechanism and it is related to a highly non - markovian memory in the sde ( limit @xmath114 ) , i.e. , the long hopping of one ball is associated with the long - range noise correlation of the `` fluid '' .",
    "such a fluid should be interpreted as the hopping `` events '' of the whole granular matter bed . for exponents",
    "@xmath100 between @xmath112 and @xmath115 ( if @xmath116hz to @xmath117hz ) , the motion of a single particle evolves from a pure hopping to a more complex behavior where the hopping - balls are perturbed by the collisions from the many - body bed .",
    "this makes necessary the introduction of a new collision operator which is written in terms of the fractional sde ( [ s9 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the hopping of a ball is perturbed ( mainly ) by few - body collisions . at frequencies",
    "@xmath13 around @xmath56hz , we observe a pure collision behavior where a ball is under the random acceleration mechanism transferred from the surrounding `` fluid '' , as it is proved because @xmath100 is between @xmath115 and @xmath118 corresponding to the random acceleration dynamics emulated by eq.([s8 ] ) .      _",
