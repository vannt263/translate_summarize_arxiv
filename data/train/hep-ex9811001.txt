    "the fermilab experiment e781 ( selex ) : a segmented large @xmath6 baryon spectrometer  @xcite , which took data in the 1996/97 fixed target run at fermilab , is designed to perform high statistics studies of production mechanisms and decay physics of charmed baryons such as @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the physics goals of the experiment require good charged particle identification to look for the different baryon decay modes .",
    "one must be able to separate @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 over a wide momentum range when looking for charmed baryon decays like @xmath14 .",
    "a rich  @xcite detector with a 2848  phototube photocathode array has been constructed  @xcite to do this .",
    "the detector begins about @xmath15 downstream of the charm production target , with two analysis magnets with @xmath16 @xmath17-kick each in - between , and is surrounded by multi - wire proportional and drift chambers which provide particle tracking .",
    "the average number of tracks reaching the rich is about 5 per event .",
    "first results from this detector can be found in  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we first describe the properties of the main parts of the detector ( vessel , mirrors , photon detector ) .",
    "finally we report about stability during the run , performance , and some preliminary physics results .",
    "=    the e781 rich vessel is a low carbon steel vessel @xmath18 in length , @xmath19 in diameter and with a wall thickness of @xmath20 the end flanges are @xmath21thick aluminum with provisions for thin beam windows and a phototube holder plate to be described later .",
    "the heavy construction allowed the vessel to be leak checked with a helium mass spectrometer .",
    "the vessel specification was to show no leak greater than @xmath22 .",
    "it easily passed the leak test and proved to be a very tight vessel in operation .",
    "= 1 the vessel has three feedthroughs and several piping connections for the gas system . electrical feedthroughs are gas - tight vacuum coaxial connectors .",
    "provisions were made for thermistors for both ends of the vessel to monitor internal temperature and an led pulser test array to supply calibration signals for the phototubes .",
    "the third port has connections for the gas analyzers .",
    "the entire interior of the vessel was painted with a flat black paint to reduce reflections of photons in the vessel . to keep the paint from contaminating the radiator gas a very low out - gassing paint",
    "was chosen  @xcite .",
    "the inner surface of the vessel was sand - blasted before painting and then sprayed .",
    "several other mechanical features of the vessel are significant .",
    "the vessel is tilted off the horizontal axis by @xmath23 with the beam entering horizontally through a thin window .",
    "the rich is also mounted on a rail system that allows it to be moved out of the beam line for the alignment of the mirrors and for certain types of physics running .",
    "stops on the rails were adjusted to allow the vessel to be put back on the beam line repeatably within @xmath24 after a vessel move .",
    "the entrance and exit windows are fabricated  from a 3-layer laminate that consists of @xmath25 kevlar  cloth , @xmath26 aluminum foil and @xmath27 charcoal tedlar .",
    "these three elements combined give a strong , gas - tight and light - tight barrier .",
    "permeability tests were conducted with both air and neon gas samples , and showed results consistent with the background level of the measuring apparatus .",
    "light - tightness was checked by measuring the noise rate in a phototube placed in a box with one side made of the window fabric , and showed no observable increase from that of a phototube inside a light - tight box . for mounting on the vessel",
    ", the window material was sandwiched between two mylar rings , and inserted between two aluminum rings which were bolted together along with a rubber o - ring seal .    to avoid the construction of a complicated gas - filling system to prevent the collapse of the phototube holder plate , which can only support a pressure difference across it of @xmath28 ,",
    "a new gas system was constructed to purge the vessel which requires only an operating pressure of @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "the vessel was purged by flow purging from air to carbon dioxide .",
    "carbon dioxide was introduced at the bottom of the vessel and displaced air was removed from the top .",
    "after the air was removed a separate circuit of the system added neon to the now @xmath30 filled vessel and froze out the excess @xmath30 with a liquid nitrogen cooled freezer keeping the pressure constant .",
    "when the vessel contained neon with only a trace of @xmath30 the final step was to pump the vessel gas through a liquid nitrogen cooled adsorber to remove the last traces of contaminates . in the initial purge for the run",
    "the oxygen background was reduced to @xmath31 .",
    "the oxygen level was data logged throughout the run .",
    "over the course of a running period lasting more than a year the oxygen level rose to an estimated @xmath32 .",
    "the large error in the final @xmath33 level stems from the fact that the oxygen monitor failed in the middle of the run due to aging ; replacing the cell after the run introduced some oxygen into the system and resulted in a reading of @xmath34 .",
    "an extrapolation from the last accurate reading was @xmath35 .",
    "the gas system was designed to allow the removal of oxygen from the neon gas during a running period . because of the tightness of the vessel and gas system the oxygen contamination never became severe enough to require purifying the neon . as a result",
    "the initial gas charge remained without change in the vessel for the entire run .",
    "the vessel also has a constant temperature control system provided by a water coil around the vessel wall and a chilled water system .",
    "fifteen cm thick building insulation was used to help keep the vessel temperature constant . during the running period",
    "the temperature was set to the same temperature as when the mirror mounts were glued onto the mirrors and the mirrors were installed and aligned . over the course of the run ( 15  months ) the temperature was @xmath36 .    to monitor the status of the detector ,",
    "data was logged  @xcite for the entire run once per minute .",
    "parameters monitored were : atmospheric pressure , vessel pressure , vessel temperature , oxygen content , temperature at several locations within the phototube box , temperature in the digitizer crates , voltages at the end of the hv zener diode chains , and status of the low voltage system .",
    "error conditions were automatically checked and reported to the shift crew .",
    "the mirror plane at the end of the vessel is build up of 16  hexagonally shaped spherical mirrors , covering a total area of @xmath37 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mirrorhex ] .",
    "each mirror is @xmath38 across ( @xmath39 tip - to - tip ) , has a thickness of @xmath40 , and is made of low expansion glass .",
    "the average radius of the mirrors is @xmath41 , with a deviation of @xmath42  rms between mirrors as well as on one mirror .",
    "the mirrors were polished until the image of a point source illuminating the whole mirror was @xmath43 .",
    "the back of the mirror is rough polished to the same radius .",
    "the leftmost and the rightmost mirrors in the central row had to be truncated by @xmath44to fit into the vessel .",
    "the central mirror has a cutout of @xmath45 to allow non - interacting beam particles to pass through the detector without interacting in the mirror to reduce bad effects in more downstream detectors .",
    "the mirrors were coated with aluminum , and an overcoating of @xmath46 .",
    "the reflectivity was @xmath47 at @xmath48 .",
    "the sphericity of all mirrors was measured using the ronchi method  @xcite , which confirmed that the mirrors were produced within the specifications .",
    "the results were used to mount the mirrors with the best sphericity in the center , and to have a minimal difference of the average radius between neighboring mirrors .",
    "the mirrors are fixed individually to a flat , low mass honeycomb panel of @xmath49thickness with a 3  point kinematic mount  ( see fig .",
    "[ mirrormount ] ) .",
    "each mount consists of an aluminum pad glued to the back of the mirror , a ball bearing , and a double differential screw built out of a @xmath50diameter titanium rod with a thread of @xmath51 , a @xmath52aluminum cylinder with a thread of @xmath53and a nylon cylinder of @xmath49diameter .",
    "this mounting scheme allowed alignment of the mirrors on a sphere with a maximum sagitta of @xmath54 , while still maintaining an angular accuracy of @xmath55 .",
    "due to space restrictions in the experimental area , the mirrors had to be mounted and aligned with the vessel moved laterally by @xmath56 from its final location in the experiment .",
    "great care was taken in assuring that vibrations during movement of the vessel do not misalign the mirrors .",
    "after mounting the mirrors on the honeycomb panel , a first rough alignment was done by eye .",
    "the final alignment was performed with a laser mounted on a theodolite base , sited at the average center of curvature .",
    "the mirror angles were adjusted until the reflected spot observed back at the center of curvature had no more than @xmath57 displacement .    to determine the alignment of the mirrors during the run , standard experiment data (",
    "no special data sets are needed ) were used to measure the center of curvature of each mirror . in an iterative procedure the predicted ring centers ( using the previous set of constants )",
    "are compared to the centers obtained from a circle fit to isolated rings , using only tracks where the cherenkov light was reflected by one mirror .",
    "this procedure converges after typically 5 iterations . with a typical data set of 1  million events , between 2000 and 50000 tracks",
    "are used to align the different mirrors .",
    "this alignment procedure was repeated for data sets taken over the whole running time of the experiment and it was found that the obtained results are constant .",
    "the final deviations from an average center of curvature are shown in fig .",

    "the mean lateral displacement is @xmath58 .",
    "the phototube holder plate is made from a @xmath59wide , @xmath60high , @xmath44thick aluminum block .",
    "figure  [ holderplate ] shows a cross section of a few of the @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) hexagonally packed ( @xmath63spacing ) holes of approximately @xmath64diameter that were drilled through it .",
    "= =    = 1 one side of each hole is a straight channel @xmath65 in depth , which is used to support a phototube .",
    "a quartz window of @xmath57 thickness was inserted into this side of the hole and glued in place , providing a gas seal between the neon radiator and the phototube housing .",
    "after the windows were glued in place , they were checked for gas - tightness using a helium leak detector .",
    "a small number of leaky ( @xmath66 ) windows were replaced .",
    "all windows were then cleaned of residual glue ( which was not uv transparent ) and their transmission checked using a spectrophotometer equipped with a fiber - optic system interface .",
    "= 1 the other side of each hole is a tapered channel @xmath49 in depth , with an inner radius of @xmath67 an aluminized mylar cone is inserted into this side and extends slightly out from the block in order to give essentially @xmath68 coverage for photon detection .",
    "the @xmath69inner radius of the cone section of the hole was made to be the same size as the photocathode of the phototubes . in order to center the tubes on the aperture and",
    "provide enough friction to hold them snugly in place , thin velcro  strips ( loop half ) were affixed along each tube . to minimize the loss of uv photons , the gap between the quartz window and the phototube had to be kept as small as possible .",
    "the feu60 phototubes however were coated with ptp wavelength shifter , so a small gap was needed in order to avoid removing the coating .",
    "these two goals were achieved by placing a thin ( @xmath25 ) mylar ring of inner diameter @xmath69up against the window .",
    "two different types of @xmath70diameter , @xmath40 bi - alkali photocathode , 10-stage tubes are used .",
    "the first is a commercially available tube r760 which has a quartz window and thus response down to @xmath71 .",
    "it has a quantum efficiency of approximately @xmath72 at its peak wavelength of @xmath73 .",
    "the second is a russian tube ( feu60 ) which has a glass entrance window .",
    "these tubes were coated with ptp wavelength shifter to reach the same wavelength range as the r760 tubes ( the quartz entrance window of the holder plate provided the @xmath71 wavelength cutoff ) .",
    "initial tests in a vacuum reflectometer equipped with a deuterium vuv - uv light source showed that the thickness of the ptp was not a critical parameter for their performance , so as many as 70  tubes were coated at one time in a vacuum deposition jar .",
    "each of the phototubes in the selex rich differed with respect to their performance under high voltage .",
    "because each column of 32  phototubes was connected to a single high voltage , it was thus required to determine each phototube s characteristics and match it to 31 other similar tubes .",
    "the two types of tubes , r760 and feu60 , are dramatically different in their quantum efficiency ( q.e . ) and noise characteristics .",
    "the feu60 tubes are on average only @xmath74 as efficient and have at least an order of magnitude greater noise at operating voltage than the r760 tubes .",
    "because it was desired to limit the accidental noise in the detector to less than @xmath75 , a simple algorithm was developed to determine operating voltage : either the voltage where the q.e",

    "quantum efficiencies were measured relative to a standard r760 phototube , whose absolute q.e .  was only approximately known .",
    "the setup used a blue led , whose light was delivered to 32  identical phototube holders and the standard tube via optical fibers , all inside a dark box .",
    "the led was driven such that it delivered on the order of @xmath78 of a photoelectron per pulse to each phototube .",
    "the output of the phototubes were digitized with the hybrid chips used in the detector , and the ecl output coming from this readout was sent to two camac scalers in series .",
    "one scaler was gated for @xmath79 in time with the signals corresponding to the led light .",
    "the other scaler was gated for the same amount of time , but midway between successive led pulses , to monitor the inherent noise of the phototube .",

    "another scaler kept count of the number of led pulses to provide a normalization .",
    "the phototube voltage for all 32  test tubes was provided by a camac - controlled high voltage supply and was scanned over the operating voltage range for all tubes .",
