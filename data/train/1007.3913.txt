    "<S> motivated by recent experiments with confined binary liquid mixtures near demixing , we study the universal critical properties of a system , which belongs to the ising universality class , in the film geometry . we employ periodic boundary conditions in the two lateral directions and fixed boundary conditions on the two confining surfaces , such that one of them has a spatially homogeneous adsorption preference while the other one exhibits a laterally alternating adsorption preference , resembling locally a single chemical step . by means of monte carlo simulations of an improved hamiltonian , so that the leading scaling corrections are suppressed , numerical integration , and finite - size scaling analysis we determine the critical casimir force and its universal scaling function for various values of the aspect ratio of the film . in the limit of a vanishing aspect ratio the critical casimir force of this system </S>",
    "<S> reduces to the mean value of the critical casimir force for laterally homogeneous @xmath0 and @xmath1 boundary conditions , corresponding to the surface spins on the two surfaces being fixed to equal and opposite values , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the universal scaling function of the critical casimir force for small but finite aspect ratios displays a linear dependence on the aspect ratio which is solely due to the presence of the lateral inhomogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the order - parameter profiles at criticality and their universal scaling function which allows us to probe theoretical predictions and to compare with experimental data . </S>"
