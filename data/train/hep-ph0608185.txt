    "it is an intriguing problem with a rather long history to explore the possible existence of hadronic excitations in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase@xcite .",
    "the existence of the hadronic ( mesonic ) excitations in the light - quark sector was first predicted as being the soft mode associated to the chiral transition@xcite .",
    "the recent lattice qcd simulations also suggest the existence of the mesonic bound states in heavy - quark sector in the qgp phase@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the effect of these bosonic excitations on the quark quasi - particle picture in the qgp phase@xcite .",
    "we first explore how the soft mode of the chiral transition@xcite affects the quark spectrum in the qgp phase using the nambu - jona - lasinio(njl ) model , and show that a novel three - peak structure is formed in the quark spectrum near the critical temperature @xmath0@xcite .",
    "we shall elucidate the mechanism and show the universality of the emergence of the three - peak structure in the fermion spectral function , employing a yukawa model composed of a massless fermion and a massive boson@xcite : we show that the complicated spectra originate from the mixing between a quark ( anti - quark ) and an anti - quark hole ( quark hole ) caused by a `` resonant scattering '' of the quasi - fermions with the thermally - excited massive boson .",

    "this model gives a second order phase transition at @xmath5mev for vanishing quark chemical potential , and the soft modes of the phase transition are dynamically formed in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels .",
    "the spectral function in these channels shows a pronounced peak in the time - like region , the peak position and the width of which become smaller and vanishes eventually , as @xmath6 approaches @xmath0@xcite .",
    "now notice that the soft modes composed of quarks can in turn contribute to the quark self - energy @xmath7 , which may be given in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) as shown diagrammatically in fig .",

    "our numerical calculation shows that the clear three - peak structure survives up to @xmath17@xcite .     in the njl and yukawa models .",
    "the left and right panels show @xmath15 in the njl model for @xmath18@xcite , and in the yukawa model for @xmath19@xcite , respectively .",

    "we have seen that `` elementary '' bosonic excitations with a small width significantly modify the quark spectrum at finite temperature . to elucidate the mechanism of the modification of the fermion spectra on the more general ground",
    ", we employ the yukawa model composed of a massless quark field @xmath20 and an elementary massive scalar boson @xmath21 ; @xmath22 in this model , the quark self - energy in the imaginary time formalism at the one - loop order is expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24^{-1}$ ] is the matsubara green function for the scalar boson .",

    "[ fig : sigma ] : there are two peaks in @xmath33 with a positive and negative energy , which grow rapidly as @xmath6 is raised .",
    "it can be easily checked that these peaks in the positive and negative energy regions physically correspond to the landau dampings shown in the right panel in fig .",

    "we remark that the incident anti - quark line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma](a ) describes a thermally excited antiquark , which disappears after the collision with the scalar boson .",
    "the disappearance of the anti - quark means the creation of a hole in the thermally - excited anti - quark distribution@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma](b ) describes the decay process of a quasi - quark which is a mixed state of quarks and antiquark - holes to an on - shell quark .",
    "the two processes induce a respective quark-`antiquark hole ' mixing and hence two gaps are realized in @xmath34 at @xmath35 where im@xmath36 has a peak corresponding to each process .",
    "the mixing mechanism of the quarks can be understood in terms of the notion of _ resonant scattering _ as in the case of the ( color-)superconductivity @xcite , although a crucial difference arises owing to the different nature of the bosonic modes . in the case of the superconductivity , the precursory soft mode which induces",
    "the mixing is diffusion - mode like and has a strength around @xmath37@xcite .",
    "the resonant scattering with the soft mode induces the mixing between a particle and a hole , and gives rise to a gap - like structure in the fermion spectrum around the fermi energy@xcite ; correspondingly , the imaginary part @xmath38 of the quark self - energy has a single peak around the fermi energy@xcite . in the present cases ,",
    "the bosonic modes have a strength at finite energies and hence the resonant scattering of the quarks bring the two peaks in @xmath38 at finite energies and induces a mixing between a quark ( antiquark ) and an antiquark - hole ( quark - hole ) .",
    "thus the two gaps in the quark spectrum are formed in the positive- and negative - energy regions .    in summary , using the njl model",
    ", we have shown that the quark spectrum in the qgp phase near the critical temperature of the chiral transition can have a three - peak structure in the low - momentum region owing to the effect of the hadronic soft modes of the chiral transition .",
    "it has been shown that the three - peak structure in the fermion spectra also arises in the yukawa model with an elementary massive boson .",
    "the detailed analysis of this model have elucidated the mechanism for the appearance the three - peak structure , which is realized as a result of the mixing between a quark(anti - quark ) and antiquark - hole ( quark - hole ) induced by the _ resonant scattering _ of the quarks .    t.k .",
