    "the velocity dispersion of galaxies on small scales ( @xmath4 mpc ) , combined with cluster abundance data on intermediate scales and the cobe normalization and galaxy peculiar velocity information on large scales , provides a strong constraint on cosmological models by constraining the shape of the matter power spectrum . in this paper",
    "we investigate a method introduced by peebles ( 1976 ; 1980 ) and davis & peebles ( 1983 , hereafter dp83 ) , which uses the anisotropy of the redshift - space correlation function to determine the pairwise velocity dispersion on small scales .",
    "we shall refer to this method as the davis - peebles method .",
    "the galaxy - galaxy correlation function @xmath5 is one of the canonical statistics used in studying large scale structure .",
    "a related statistic is the redshift - space correlation function , @xmath6 , which is a function of the components of the separation in redshift space perpendicular ( @xmath7 ) and parallel ( @xmath8 ) to the line of sight .",
    "if the correlation function is isotropic in real space , it will be anisotropic in redshift space due to the peculiar velocities of the galaxies .",
    "hence the degree of anisotropy of @xmath9 is a measure of the moments of the peculiar velocity distribution .",
    "the first moment of the pairwise velocity distribution , @xmath10 , is proportional to @xmath11 if galaxies trace mass and density fluctuations are in the linear regime , where @xmath12 is the density of matter in units of the critical density at the present epoch .",
    "the second moment , @xmath3 , is the velocity dispersion and measures the kinetic energy of the galaxy distribution .",
    "this quantity has been used in combination with the cosmic virial theorem to estimate @xmath12 ( dp83 ) , although recently some authors have presented arguments that this calculation is not only plagued by extremely large uncertainties from cosmic variance ( fisher et al .",
    "1994b ) , but that some fundamental assumptions in the usual formulation of the cosmic virial theorem may also be incorrect ( bartlett & blanchard 1995 ) .",
    "the first calculation of @xmath3 on a relatively large survey was done by davis and peebles ( dp83 ) .",
    "they calculated @xmath3 for the cfa1 redshift survey , a survey containing 1840 redshifts covering 1.83 steradians in the north galactic hemisphere ( huchra et al .",
    "1983 ) . in another paper ( somerville , davis , & primack 1996 , hereafter sdp )",
    ", we present a reanalysis of their work , in which we show that @xmath3 for this sample is extremely sensitive to the way in which corrections for infall into the virgo cluster are applied , and that the value of @xmath3 for this survey is dominated by the clusters .",
    "the same calculation was done on the southern sky redshift survey(ssrs1 ) ( da costa et al . 1991 ) , with results of @xmath13 km / s ( sdp ; davis 1988 ) .",
    "recently @xmath3 has also been calculated for the iras survey ( fisher et al .",
    "1994b ) , the cfa2/ssrs2 survey ( marzke et al . 1995 ) , and the perseus - pisces survey ( guzzo et al . 1995 ) .",
    "these calculations have shown a range of values of @xmath14 from 272 km / s for ssrs2 to 769 km / s for perseus - pisces ( see table 1 of sdp for a summary ) .",
    "the values of @xmath3 usually quoted for simulations are calculated by measuring the dispersion of the pairwise peculiar velocity field directly using the full three - dimension position and velocity information for the halos ( davis et al .",
    "1985 ; gelb & bertschinger 1994 ; klypin et al . 1993 ) . in real redshift surveys , not only are there errors introduced by edge effects and selection effects , but @xmath3 is extracted by fitting a model to the correlation function in redshift space , @xmath9 .",
    "this quantity is quite noisy especially for samples with small numbers of galaxies .",
    "in addition the procedure involves a number of assumptions .",
    "it is a reasonable question , therefore , whether the values from simulations may be meaningfully compared to the observational values .",
    "zurek et al .",
    "( 1994 ) applied the davis - peebles method to mock redshift surveys extracted from simulations of a standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) model , and found that this yields a rather large range of values for @xmath3 .",
    "so far there has not been a comparison of @xmath3 calculated using the davis - peebles method on `` observed '' simulations of different cosmological models . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the robustness of @xmath3 using mock redshift surveys extracted from several different cold dark matter dominated models , and the ability of this statistic to discriminate between such models .",
    "we estimate the sky - variance and cosmic variance of the statistic and identify sources of error in the davis - peebles method .",
    "we also investigate the effects of removing clusters from the samples .",
    "the models and simulations are described in detail in klypin , nolthenius & primack ( 1995 , henceforth knp ) .",
    "all of the models studied here have gaussian initial fluctuations with a harrison - zeldovich scale invariant spectrum , density parameter @xmath15 and hubble parameter @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the models represented are two variants of cold dark matter ( cdm ) and one variant of cold plus hot dark matter ( chdm ) .",
    "the `` standard '' cold dark matter model assumes that the fraction of the mass in the universe made of baryons is @xmath18 with the rest of the mass made up of a species of non - relativistic , dissipationless particle ( the cold dark matter ) .",
    "there are different ways of normalizing the spectrum  `` unbiased '' ( b=1 ) , which assumes that the galaxy fluctuations trace the dark matter fluctuations , and `` biased '' , which assumes that perhaps only especially large amplitude fluctuations lead to galaxy formation , i.e. @xmath19 .",
    "we have analyzed an `` unbiased '' ( b=1 ) simulation ( which we call cdm1 ) and a b=1.5 simulation ( cdm1.5 ) . in linear theory",
    ", this corresponds to rms fluctuations of mass in a sphere of @xmath20 mpc radius @xmath21 for the unbiased model , @xmath22 for the biased model , or a quadrupole in the angular fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background of @xmath23 or @xmath24 respectively ( knp ) .",
    "the value of @xmath25 for the unbiased model was consistent with the lowest normalization quoted in the first - year cobe results ( smoot et al .",
    "it is too low in view of the more recent cobe results , which give @xmath26 ( gorski et al .",
    "1996 ) , but this model is still of considerable interest . the biased model ( cdm1.5 ) is not compatible with the cobe measurement of @xmath25 ; however , it does predict approximately the correct number density of clusters ( frenk et al .",
    "1990 ) , and is useful for comparison .    the cold plus hot dark matter ( chdm ) model assumes that the non - baryonic matter is made of a cold component , as before , and a hot component , generally thought to be a massive neutrino . in `` standard '' chdm",
    ", the ratio of cold to hot to baryonic matter is @xmath27 , corresponding to a single massive neutrino with a mass of about 7 ev .",
    "the power spectrum in our model is normalized to @xmath28 , corresponding to @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "more recent data and analyses favoring a smaller fraction of the mass in neutrinos , @xmath31 , are summarized in primack et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and liddle et al .",
    "our preliminary analysis of new simulations with @xmath32 indicate that @xmath3 in this model does not differ substantially from the @xmath33 model on the scales of interest in this paper .",
    "the simulations were done using a standard particle - mesh ( pm ) code with a @xmath34 force mesh .",
    "each simulation has @xmath35 cold particles , and the chdm simulations have two additional sets of @xmath35 hot particles with random thermal velocities corresponding to fermi - dirac distribution ( knp ) .",
    "the size of the computational box is 100 mpc ( i.e. @xmath36 for @xmath37 ) and the smallest resolved co - moving scale is @xmath38 kpc .",
    "the initial fluctuations were generated with the same random numbers for chdm1 and both cdm simulations .",
    "after running the chdm1 simulation , it was discovered that there were two mistakes in the initial conditions ( see knp ) , which fortunately are in phase and largely cancel . a new simulation with the same cosmological parameters but different initial conditions ( and mistakes corrected )",
    "was run  we call this chdm2 . extensive comparison of the two simulations has shown that the power and velocity differences on small scales are no more than 5% at @xmath39 .",
    "in addition , there was a statistical fluke ( of about 10% probability ) in the initial conditions for both cdm simulations and chdm1 : the amplitude of the longest waves was a factor of 1.3 - 1.4 larger than that expected for the ensemble average , so the power on large scales is approximately a factor of two larger than typical .",
    "however , this could be considered a compensation for the finite size of the box , or in the case of cdm1 , as compensation for the low normalization compared to cobe .",
    "also , comparing cfa1 to the much larger apm survey shows that the cfa1 region has unusually high power at these scales ( nolthenius , klypin & primack 1996 ( nkp ) , baugh & efstathiou 1993 ) . in any case comparison of chdm1 and chdm2 , which has a typical amount of power ,",
    "gives us a measure of cosmic variance .    in order to compare our simulations with observations ,",
    "we need to identify objects which correspond to galaxies .",
    "there is no satisfactory proscription to do this in simulations containing only dissipationless dark matter ( summers , davis , & evrard 1995 ) .",
    "one approach is to assume that galaxies form in regions where the dark matter has collapsed to a sufficiently high density .",
    "however , a well - known problem with this procedure is that when the dark matter halos merge , they quickly lose all discernable substructure .",
    "this results in a halo mass distribution which includes a few very large mass ( @xmath40 ) halos in the final epoch of the simulations which should probably be associated with the dark matter in cluster cores rather than with the halos surrounding single galaxies ( katz & white 1993 ; gelb & bertschinger 1994 ) . in simulations with hydrodynamics and gas , the baryons can lose energy and form smaller clumps which remain distinct within the overmerged dark matter halos ( c.f .",
    "evrard , summers , & davis 1994 ; hernquist & katz 1989 ; cen & ostriker 1992 ) . however , associating these baryon clumps with galaxies is still an oversimplification as the details of galaxy formation depend on many interdependent processes including dissipation , gas dynamics , star formation , and energy feedback from supernova .",
    "exactly how these processes affect galaxy formation is not well understood and it is not possible to include these effects in n - body simulations on cosmological scales with present computing capabilities .",
    "clearly , for the present study of large scale structure , it is necessary to attempt to make use of information from dissipationless simulations as best we can .",
    "therefore , we have adopted a scheme , informed by results from simulations with gas and hydrodynamics ( evrard et al .",
    "1994 ) , for `` breaking - up '' the overmerged dark matter halos .",
    "although this procedure is ad hoc and has many limitations , it does go a step further towards enabling a realistic comparison between real redshift surveys and simulations than many previous analyses of simulations .",
    "the procedure for breaking up the halos , assigning luminosities , and forming magnitude limited `` sky - catalogs '' which mimic the cfa1 redshift survey is described in detail in nkp .",
    "first , halos were identified as mesh cells with a sufficiently high dark particle mass overdensity @xmath41 at the end of the simulation ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "halos with a mass above a certain cutoff were broken up and the fragments were assigned masses according to a schechter distribution .",
    "fragment velocities were chosen randomly from a gaussian distribution using the rms velocity of the nearest neighbors as the dispersion .",
    "luminosities were chosen randomly from a schechter distribution with the same parameters as the cfa1 catalog and assigned to the halo fragments assuming that higher luminosity corresponded to higher 1-cell mass .",
    "this results in a distribution with the same selection function as the cfa1 catalog .",
    "the broken - up dark matter halos are hereafter somewhat metaphorically referred to as `` galaxies '' .    to construct the mock cfa1 catalogs ,",
    "six different `` home galaxies '' were selected for each simulation , in such a way as to mimic the conditions of the cfa1 redshift survey : the home galaxies were required to lie in an area with local galaxy density within a factor of 1.5 of the local cfa1 density , and to have a virgo - sized cluster about 20 mpc away .",
    "an `` observer '' was placed on each home galaxy and radial velocities along the line of sight were calculated for each galaxy .",
    "catalogs were created with the same angular boundaries as the cfa1 north survey ( @xmath43 , 1.83 sr ) , and also all - sky catalogs containing all galaxies with @xmath44 ( 10.4 sr ) .    in order to check the effectiveness of our break - up procedure",
    ", we have verified that the galaxy - galaxy correlation function in real space follows a power law all the way down to the resolution limit . without break - up",
    ", the correlation function falls below the power law on small scales .",
    "we have also checked that hierarchical scaling holds for the galaxies ; i.e. that the volume - averaged three - point function is proportional to the averaged two - point function squared .",
    "we have found that the reduced skewness @xmath45 is constant to a good approximation from @xmath46 mpc to @xmath47 mpc .",
    "these results suggest that our break - up procedure leads to a halo distribution with the expected clustering properties , at least to this order on these scales .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the method used to extract the pairwise velocity dispersion @xmath3 from the redshift - space correlation function @xmath9 .",
    "readers should refer to dp83 and fisher et al .",
    "( 1994a , b ) for more details of the method .",
    "the correlation function in redshift space , @xmath6 , is estimated by counting the number of pairs in a bin in @xmath7 ( separation perpendicular to the line of sight ) and @xmath8 ( separation parallel to the line of sight ) .",
    "it is normalized by constructing a catalog of poisson distributed points with the same selection function and angular limits as the data , and counting pairs between the data and the poisson catalog : @xmath48 where dd is the number of pairs between data and data , and dr is number of pairs between the data catalog and a poisson catalog .",
    "the quantities @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the minimum variance weighted densities ( see davis & huchra 1982 ) of the poisson and data catalogs , respectively . in practice , we use a large ensemble of poisson catalogs in order to reduce shot noise and to ensure that no bin has zero pair count .",
    "let @xmath51 be the distribution function of velocity differences @xmath52 for pairs of galaxies with vector separation @xmath53 , and @xmath54 the velocity distribution function averaged over the directions perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the first moment of @xmath51 is @xmath55 \\cdot \\hat{r } } \\rangle$ ] where the average is number ( not volume ) weighted .",
    "this quantity is also known as the mean streaming velocity , and assuming isotropy it is a function only of the magnitude of @xmath53 . correspondingly , the first moment of @xmath54 is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the component of @xmath53 along the line of sight .",
    "a reasonable form for the distribution function @xmath58 , parameterized by its moments , is @xmath59^{n}\\right)\\ ] ] it has been found emperically from studying observations and n - body simulations ( peebles 1976 ; fisher et al .",
    "1994b ; marzke et al .",
    "1995 ) that on small scales an exponential form ( n=1 ) fits the data better than a gaussian ( n=2 ) or any higher power of the argument .",
    "we have also tested this assumption for our n - body simulations and find excellent agreement with an exponential in all the models up to scales of @xmath60 .",
    "recently , sheth ( 1996 ) gave a derivation of the exponential form for the distribution function using the press - schechter approach .",
    "adopting this form for @xmath61 , and using @xmath62 and @xmath63 we have : @xmath64 \\exp \\left[\\frac{-\\sqrt{2}}{\\sigma_{12}(r ) }   \\left| \\pi- h_0 y \\left[1 - \\frac{\\overline{v_{12}}(r)}{h_{0}r }   \\right ] \\right| \\right ]    \\label{eq : modelxi}\\ ] ] an approximation based on self - similar solutions of the bbgky hierarchy leads to a form for @xmath10 ( davis & peebles 1977 ) : @xmath65 }   \\label{eq : infall}\\ ] ] f is an adjustable parameter of the model .",
    "the assumption of stable clustering , i.e. that the collapse of the cluster is exactly balanced by the hubble flow , corresponds to f = 1 .",
    "the results presented here are for f = 1 unless stated otherwise . later on in this paper",
    "we investigate this model , including the validity of the stable clustering assumption , by calculating @xmath10 in the n - body simulations .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath3 is then obtained by fitting the model of equation  ( [ eq : modelxi ] ) to @xmath6 estimated from equation  ( [ eq : xi ] ) .",
    "one approach to comparing observations to simulations is to try to translate the space of observed quantities ( i.e. redshift ) into the space of the simulations ( real space ) .",
    "reflecting this approach , dp83 attempted to correct the measured redshifts by modeling the flow field around virgo , which is in the foreground of the cfa1 survey .",
    "however , we have shown that the value of @xmath3 depends sensitively on the details of these corrections ( sdp ) .",
    "another approach is to `` observe '' the simulations to form simulated redshift surveys , which attempt to mimic as closely as possible what astronomers would actually observe if they lived in the universe of that simulation , and to then analyze the simulated and observed catalogs in exactly the same way . taking this approach , we have selected catalogs from the simulations requiring that a virgo - sized cluster appear in the foreground as described in section [ sec - sims ] , and do not include corrections for cluster infall in any part of the procedure .",
    "contour plots of @xmath9 for the 10.4 sr sky - catalogs are shown in figure  [ fig : xicont ] .",
    "for each simulation , @xmath6 has been averaged over 6 views and smoothed .",
    "( for purposes of the contour plots only , @xmath66 was calculated with linear bins in @xmath67 and @xmath8 . for the rest of the calculation ,",
    "logarithmic bins were used in @xmath67 and linear bins in @xmath8 ) .",
    "there is a visible difference in the shape of the contours for the different models . in the absence of peculiar velocities",
    ", the contours would be perfectly circular segments .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion of clusters causes structures to appear elongated along the line of sight for small @xmath67 ( the familiar `` fingers of god '' ) , and infall causes the contours to appear compressed in the line of sight direction for larger @xmath67 .",
    "this effect is much more pronounced in the cdm models as expected due to the larger velocity dispersions and infall velocities .",
    "the values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 obtained from the inversion of @xmath70 ( see dp83 ) and used in the fit for @xmath3 are given in table 3 .",
    "the results for @xmath1 are shown in figure  [ fig : sigma ] .",
    "the points are the average of the results for the six views , and the error bars are standard deviations for the different views .",
    "these error bars reflect the `` sky variance '' , or variation within the same simulation when viewed from different points , which for this relatively small box size is likely to be an underestimate of the true cosmic variance .",
    "the difference between chdm1 and chdm2 , about 200 km / s at @xmath71 mpc , may give a better estimate of the possible cosmic variance .",
    "this is consistent with the large variance seen in recent calculations of @xmath3 in different redshift surveys ( see sdp ) .",
    "we attempted to address this apparent non - robustness of @xmath3 by developing an algorithm to automatically remove clusters from catalogs in a way which could be applied consistently to both real and simulated data .",
    "it is no surprise that rich clusters are a major source of sample - to - sample variation in @xmath3 . because @xmath9 is a pair - weighted statistic , clusters tend to dominate it .",
    "we saw in sdp that removing the virgo cluster from the cfa1 survey significantly reduced @xmath3 , consistent with the findings of zurek et al .",
    "the ssrs1 survey does not contain any clusters as rich as the virgo or coma clusters found in cfa1 , and @xmath3 is much smaller for ssrs1 ( @xmath72 km / s ) than for cfa1 ( @xmath73 km / s)(sdp ) .",
    "fisher et al . ( 1994b ) found @xmath14 for the iras redshift survey to be only about 320 km / s , much lower than the result for cfa1 . the iras survey is dominated by dusty spiral galaxies and undercounts cluster centers by about a factor of 2 relative to optically selected surveys .",
    "marzke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) also found that removing abell clusters of richness class r@xmath741 significantly reduces @xmath3 in the cfa2/ssrs2 survey , and that @xmath3 changes more drastically in regions of the survey where there were many rich clusters to begin with . in view of this evidence , we thought it interesting to see what happens to @xmath3 when the clusters are removed from the simulations .",
    "we therefore developed a method to remove clusters which can be applied consistently to both simulations and observations .",
    "our algorithm is as follows .",
    "we divide the catalog into bins and identify bins with density fluctuations larger than a specified cutoff .",
    "we then calculate the luminosity weighted centroid of all points lying within a cylinder of radius @xmath75 and redshift interval @xmath76 centered on the bin where the fluctuation was found .",
    "we use @xmath77 km / s , and adjust @xmath78 as described later .",
    "we then take a new cylinder centered on the centroid , calculate the new centroid , and continue to iterate in this way until the position of the centroid changes by less than some small value .",
    "finally , we calculate the velocity dispersion of all the galaxies lying within the cylinder around the converged centroid , and cut all the galaxies in this cylinder only if the velocity dispersion is greater than a cutoff @xmath79 .",
    "we have tested our algorithm by visualizing the surveys to make sure that the regions which are cut correspond to those that would be identified visually .",
    "the number of clusters identified depends on both parameters @xmath78 and @xmath80 .",
    "we chose a value of @xmath78 by plotting profiles of the clusters and identifying the radius at which the number density had dropped to the background level .",
    "the fiducial value we chose , @xmath81 mpc , is fairly close to the usual abell radius .",
    "table 1 shows the results of varying @xmath80 .",
    "as @xmath80 is lowered , the algorithm identifies more and more objects as `` clusters ''  of course as we go to lower values of @xmath80 we are really starting to identify objects which we would normally refer to as groups .",
    "we select @xmath82 km / s as corresponding to what are usually referred to as clusters because at this cutoff approximately 4 - 9 % of the galaxies are in clusters , which roughly agrees with observations .",
    "table 2 shows properties of clusters identified at @xmath82 km / s .",
    "the results for @xmath1 after cluster removal with @xmath83 mpc and @xmath84 km / s are shown in figure  [ fig : sigmanoclusters ] .",
    "the sky - variance has decreased somewhat for the cdm models but not significantly for the chdm models .",
    "the cosmic variance between the two chdm models has decreased slightly : @xmath14 for chdm1 and chdm2 now differs by about 150 km / s instead of 200 km / s .",
    "however @xmath14 for the biased cdm model now lies between the two values for chdm1 and chdm2 , and even standard cdm gives a value of @xmath14 which is within the view - to - view error bars of the chdm1 value .",
    "therefore , the small improvement in robustness acheived by removing the clusters appears to have been attained at the expense of discrimination between models .",
    "this problem can not be solved by using a different value for @xmath80 , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : sigc_vs_sig12 ] .",
    "the discrimination becomes worse as we go to lower values of @xmath80 , and for higher values there is very little change in the values of @xmath3 .",
    "the fact that @xmath14 appears to converge to almost the same value for all of the models as we lower @xmath80 is probably an indication that , once we remove the collapsed objects , @xmath3 is really a measure of @xmath85 .",
    "in fact , originally this statistic was not designed as a tool to discriminate between models .",
    "it was hoped that it would be useful as a measure of @xmath12 ( or of @xmath86 , to be precise , where b is the bias factor defined in section [ sec - sims ] ) ( dp83 , davis 1995 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to see what would happen as we remove clusters in simulations with different values of @xmath85 .    the change in @xmath3 as a function of @xmath80 has a different shape for the different models . in figure",
    "[ fig : ncut_vs_dsig12 ] , we show the change in @xmath14 as a function of the number of clusters cut at different values of @xmath80 .",
    "it is interesting that the curve for chdm1 lies on top of the curve for chdm2 on this plot even though the values of @xmath3 are very different .",
    "what this seems to indicate is that although the curve for chdm1 extends further to the right , indicating that chdm1 has more clusters than chdm2 ( because of the excess large scale power ) , the clusters themselves have the same velocity structure , because the small scale power is the same .",
    "the cdm models have more power on small scales and the clusters have more kinetic energy , as indicated by the steeper rise in @xmath87 . in addition",
    "the curves extend further to the right than chdm2 because the cdm models also have a larger number density of clusters than a typical chdm model . plotted in this way",
    ", this quantity may give interesting information on the amount of power present on cluster and subcluster scales .",
    "it appears to be more robust and discriminatory than the actual value of @xmath14 .",
    "however , it is not very useful at present because existing redshift surveys do not contain enough clusters to allow this quantity to be calculated in the region where it is discriminatory",
    ". it would be interesting to study this in future large volume surveys with good sky coverage .",
    "a form for the pairwise peculiar velocity distribution must be assumed in the procedure we have used to calculate @xmath3 . as we discussed briefly",
    ", the form used by dp83 and other authors who have recently completed similar analyses is an isotropic exponential , which was proposed by peebles ( 1976 ) because it appeared to fit observations .",
    "this functional form was further investigated by fisher et al .",
    "( 1994b ) and marzke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and found to be consistent with the iras and cfa2/ssrs2 redshift surveys , and with cold dark matter n - body simulations .",
    "however , we thought it would be interesting to study the form of the pairwise velocity distribution in real space for our different models to re - evaluate whether this is the most appropriate form .",
    "we also take advantage of the fact that unlike in real observations , in the simulations we know the real - space positions of the galaxies and their peculiar velocities separately .",
    "we compare the `` true '' value of @xmath3 obtained by fitting directly to the peculiar velocity distribution with the results of the davis - peebles procedure .",
    "we may then evaluate whether the `` true '' value of @xmath3 , uncomplicated by extracting it from the redshift space data , is a robust discriminator between models . in this way we can test the accuracy of the davis - peebles method for extracting @xmath1 .",
    "we find that the exponential is an excellent fit to the distribution on small scales in all the models . on scales of @xmath88",
    "mpc the distribution begins to look a bit flatter at small @xmath89 than the exponential , and the distribution begins to approach a gaussian at even larger separations .",
    "however , at the scales where this procedure is used ( @xmath90 mpc ) , using this model is not likely to be a significant source of error .    as we mentioned in section  [ sec - method ] , following dp83 ( and subsequent workers ) we have modeled the mean streaming velocity @xmath10 by equation  ( [ eq : infall ] ) in our fitting procedure .",
    "marzke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and others have suggested that the observed scale dependence of @xmath3 may be merely an artifact of this term . we have investigated this quantity by computing it directly in the simulations .",
    "it is shown in figure  [ fig : v12 ] along with the model for f=1 and f=0.5 .",
    "the general form of the model holds on intermediate scales , but there is a large amount of variation between the different views , and the prediction of the model on scales of @xmath71 mpc is in many cases quite inaccurate .",
    "the cdm models show a rather large negative mean streaming velocity on small scales , which may correspond to shell crossing . on average the model with @xmath91",
    "appears to overpredict @xmath92 for chdm , while @xmath93 may be a better fit .",
    "this is surprising because @xmath91 corresponds to streaming which exactly cancels the hubble flow on scales less than the correlation length ( stable clustering ) , @xmath94 corresponds to collapse on those scales , and @xmath95 indicates that the clusters are not collapsing , and in fact are expanding .",
    "this implies that stable clustering on is not a good assumption for the chdm models .    to show the dependence of the results on the assumed value of @xmath96 , in figure  [ fig : signoinfall ] we show the results obtained for @xmath3 ( using the davis - peebles method on the `` observed '' sky - catalogs , as before ) when we do not include the streaming model in the fit , i.e. when we set @xmath97 .",
    "this systematically reduces the values of @xmath3 that we obtain , and changes the scale dependence as expected .",
    "the chdm models are now entirely flat over @xmath67 .",
    "it is also possible to allow @xmath96 to be fit as a free parameter .",
    "the problem with this approach is that there is a degeneracy between @xmath96 and @xmath3  we tended to obtain lower values of both parameters when we allowed @xmath96 to be fit freely .",
    "in addition , having two free parameters increases the error on the fit .",
    "apparently , the use of this model for the mean streaming , especially with the assumption of stable clustering ( @xmath91 ) could be a substantial source of error in the procedure .",
    "figure  [ fig : truesigma ] shows the results obtained when @xmath3 was fit directly to @xmath98 using the peculiar velocity information from the simulations .",
    "although we use the real space positions and peculiar velocities of the galaxies , we use the same galaxies as those in the magnitude - limited sky - catalogs in order to facilitate a direct comparison of @xmath99 with the value obtained by the davis - peebles method ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "table 3 shows @xmath100 with and without the streaming model and @xmath99 at @xmath71 mpc , averaged over the six views .",
    "the results for @xmath100 are within 20% of @xmath99 for all the simulations .",
    "the agreement with @xmath99 is better for all the simulations except chdm2 if we do not include the streaming model ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the view - to - view variation is comparable for @xmath100 and @xmath99 , which suggests that the variation is not noise introduced by the davis - peebles method of extracting @xmath3 but that it is intrinsic in the simulations and presumably in the real universe .",
    "for the n - body simulations of three different cosmological models that we have analyzed , we find that the values of @xmath3 are considerably higher for cdm models than for chdm models . the chdm models , which give @xmath101 km / s for chdm2 to 740 ( 600 ) km / s for chdm1 are perhaps more consistent with the body of observational values taken as a whole .",
    "( numbers in paranthesis are for @xmath97 ) . although @xmath102 km / s for cfa2 north is marginally consistent even with unbiased cdm ( @xmath103 km / s ) , @xmath14 for cfa2 south ( 367 km / s ) and ssrs2 ( 272 km / s ) are not ( marzke et al . 1995 ) . however , because of the problems with galaxy identification discussed in section [ sec - sims ] , we do not think that any model studied here should be ruled out on the basis of these results .",
    "any existing large volume n - body simulations would have similar problems .",
    "the point of this paper is precisely to suggest that it is premature to use @xmath3 to draw any strong conclusions about cosmological models .",
    "however , studying the simulations has given us other interesting information .",
    "we have estimated the expected sky - variance and cosmic variance of @xmath3 in our models .",
    "the following values are quoted for @xmath104 .",
    "the sky - variance ( calculated as the standard deviation over six mock catalogs ) ranges from @xmath105 km / s for chdm2 to @xmath106 km / s for cdm1 .",
    "the cosmic variance ( between two simulations with different initial conditions ) for chdm is @xmath107 km / s .",
    "the errors usually quoted for @xmath3 are formal errors on the fit ( for which we obtain typically @xmath105 km / s ) and in general are underestimates of the actual statistical errors .",
    "we evaluate the accuracy of the davis - peebles method for extracting @xmath3 from redshift catalogs by comparing with the results of computing the velocity dispersion directly in our mock catalogs .",
    "we obtain agreement of better than 20% for all of our models .",
    "this leads us to interpret the large range of values of @xmath3 obtained from different redshift surveys as an intrinsic variation due to the sensitivity of the statistic to the clusters contained in the sample , rather than being due to errors in the method .",
    "we have investigated the effects of removing clusters from the samples using an automated procedure .",
    "it was hoped that this might make @xmath3 a more robust statistic .",
    "however , we found that although this reduces the sample - to - sample variation in @xmath1 by a small amount , it actually reduces the ability of the statistic to discriminate between the cosmological models we studied .",
    "this may be due to the fact that all of our simulations are of @xmath108 models , and that once clusters are removed @xmath3 is really a measure of @xmath12 .",
    "however , our study of the simulations suggests that the change in @xmath14 as a function of the number of clusters removed may be an interesting quantity to study in future redshift surveys .",
    "we find that an exponential form for the pairwise peculiar velocity distribution is an excellent approximation on small scales ( @xmath109 mpc ) in all the models studied .",
    "measuring the mean streaming @xmath10 directly from the simulations revealed that although the general form of the model used in the davis - peebles method does hold , on small scales the measured values may deviate from it considerably .",
    "we found that stable clustering is a reasonable approximation in the unbiased ( b=1 ) cdm model but not in the chdm models .",
    "the use of the bbgky model for the mean streaming , especially with the assumption of stable clustering ( @xmath91 ) could be a substantial source of error in the davis - peebles method .",
    "we have shown that @xmath3 is very sensitive to both the number and the properties of the clusters in a sample .",
    "this makes @xmath3 a poor constraint on cosmological models given the current situation with regards to both simulations and observations .",
    "even the largest existing redshift surveys do not represent a fair sample of rich clusters .",
    "also , current n - body simulations do not simulate clusters realistically because cluster properties are probably sensitive to non - gravitational physics such as gas hydrodynamics , star formation , and supernova feedback  effects which are impossible to include in large volume simulations with current computing capabilities .",
    "as larger redshift surveys become available and it becomes possible to simulate clusters in a cosmologically relevant volume , perhaps the robustness of @xmath14 will improve .",
    "in fact , we have suggested a way in which the very sensitivity of @xmath3 to the properties of clusters could be used to define an interesting statistic for characterizing large scale structure in larger samples . in the meantime",
    "it is worthwhile to work on developing statistics which are discriminatory but less sensitive to the properties of clusters .",
