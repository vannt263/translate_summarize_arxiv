    "the origin of the magellanic clouds , as well as the nearby satellite galaxies of the milky way ( mw ) , is still a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "the discussion is motivated by the accurate determination of the clouds proper motions that were carried out from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations by @xcite .",
    "the total velocity of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) in the galactocentic coordinate is claimed be @xmath0 ( a transverse velocity of @xmath1  and a radial velocity of @xmath2  ) .",
    "although the revised analysis by @xcite decreases the transverse velocity to @xmath3  , both of the results from hst data are significantly higher than the previously adopted value , i.e. , 281  @xcite . at such a high speed",
    ", lmc may approach the escape velocity at its distance to the mw and the orbital angular momenta is comparable and nearly perpendicular to the angular momentum of the mw disk @xcite .",
    "this may argue for a first passage of the magellanic clouds near the milky way ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that their morphologies and gas content is at odd with other satellites also suggest that they recently falls to the milky way from the outskirts of the local group @xcite .",
    "@xcite construct a model for the local group , including andromeda ( m31 ) , the mw and the lmc . by solving the equations of motion",
    ", they find that m31 may have affected the orbit of lmc at a distance of 500 - 700 kpc about 5 gyrs ago .",
    "although @xcite did not investigate the origin of lmc by their models , one interesting orbit of lmc is worth to mention here . in their fig .",
    "14 , the orbit under the model of prolate mw halo turns close to the direction of m31 . the proposition",
    "that magellanic clouds may originate from m31 was firstly made by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this _ letter _ revisits this proposition in the frame of the recent discoveries of large scale structures surrounding m31 suggesting a very tumultuous past history for this galaxy @xcite .",
    "we are still lacking of a complete model of m31 outskirts although many of its properties are consistent with a past major merger ( @xcite ) . if true , such a merger should have been gaseous rich enough to allow the reformation of the significant m31 disk ( ) . during such events gas - rich dwarf galaxies",
    "may be formed from material liberated by the collision ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is natural to wonder whether or not some tidal dwarf galaxies may have been ejected close to the orbital plane of the hypothetic merger , which is indeed defined by the actual m31 disk .",
    "a significant part of the ejected material have angular momentum within small angles from the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the m31 disk is seen almost edge - on from the milky way , suggesting that the milky way is located close to the orbital plane of the debris ejected from a major merger of m31 .",
    "this may lead to a fully new interpretation of the magellanic clouds , that could be tidal dwarves , as massive and concentrated debris lying in a tidal tail ejected during a past event in m31 , in the direction of the milky way .",
    "in fact , @xcite propose a major model for the formation of m31 which reproduces most of its properties including those of its haunted halo ; for _ some _ solutions , a significant amount of matter is predicted to be ejected from the merger in the direction of the milky way .    the goal of this _ letter _ is to test whether the magellanic clouds could have been tidal dwarves ejected during a past major merger occurring at the m31 location .",
    "the robust measurements of lmc proper motion give a very strong constrain on its origin by inverting its past trajectory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , there is a large uncertainty in the determination of the tangential motion of m31 , up to @xmath4 , ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "taking into account all uncertainties , we investigate the possible trajectories of the lmc and whether or not it could have approached m31 down to 50 kpc .",
    "we solve the equations of motion in a dynamical model including mw , m31 and lmc , and throughout the paper , all the 3d coordinates , velocities are quoted in the galactocentric frame that is centered on the mw @xcite .",
    "we adopt the concordance cosmological parameters of @xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "fig .  [ figpositions ] shows the 3d positions of the mw , m31 and lmc . a possible unbound trajectory of lmc in the past is also shown by assuming a zero transverse velocity of m31 for our model described below ( sect .  [ secmethod ] ) .",
    "this solution is similar to the results presented by @xcite .",
    "given the fact of large uncertainties in the determination of tangential motion of m31 , up to @xmath4 ( see above text ) , one can expect that m31 could have a @xmath9 at present time , meaning that m31 was closer to the past trajectory of lmc .",
    "the 3d velocity of m31 can be linked to its proper motion on sky by following the work by @xcite .",
    "we adopt the standard iau values , i.e. , @xmath10 kpc and @xmath11 @xmath12 for the circular velocity @xcite , and the solar motion with respect to the local standard of rest is corrected by taking @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the basic data adopted for m31 are listed in table  [ tbobspar ] , as well as the data for lmc . in the following ,",
    "we build a dynamical model of mw , m31 and lmc , then investigate the possible proper motions of m31 and its impact on the lmc origin .",
    "+    .basic parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "could the magellanic clouds be ejected tidal dwarves from a previous major merger occurring at the m31 location ? in this letter we simply demonstrate that it could be the case , within a reasonable range of parameters for both the milky way and m31 . in our study we did not consider the effect of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) to lmc as the former has a much smaller mass than the latter , and as such , our study of the lmc motion can realistically apply to the motion of both magellanic clouds together .",
    "we have also considered the possible impact of the gravitational potential of both the virgo cluster and the great attractor ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are modelled by giant halos of nfw profile and find that they affect very marginally the lmc trajectories .",
    "the model presented here is possibly static assuming that only the m31 mass could have increase during the last 8 gyr , through a major merger , thus neglecting some possible mass accretion of minor mergers . assuming a smaller mass of m31 in the past ( 2 times less massive )",
    "would generate a larger travel time for the lmc ( 8 gyr instead of 5.5 gyr for our @xmath14 model ) .    besides this",
    ", we show that such an hypothesis is possible , although it does not demonstrate that it is indeed the case . to go beyond",
    "requires an estimate of several quantities , especially the tangential velocity of m31 and the axis ratio of the milky way potential . @xcite",
    "have estimated tangential velocity of m31 to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 , i.e. in the same direction than assumed in eq .",
    "[ eqms ] ) , but with smaller amplitude .",
    "these estimates were based on the assumption that m31 satellites follow the motion of m31 through space .",
    "we have tested a null hypothesis for the tangential velocity of m31 and find that it implies a very prolate milky way halo with @xmath17 .",
    "however the @xcite assumption may not hold in the case of an major merger in the past history of m31 because the orbital motions of its satellite system could be much more chaotic than expected by @xcite . on the other hand , assuming a spherical halo for the milky way leads to values for the m31 proper motion which are larger than what is typically quoted , often on the basis of the timing argument .",
    "possibly , the timing argument has to be re - formulated in a scheme for which there were more than 2 bodies with a mass similar to the milky way , 6 gyr ago ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is wiser to test our hypothesis by considering observable parameters that are not assuming a specific history for the local group satellite system .",
    "the result is somewhat troubling .",
    "first , by tracing back the lmc motion to m31 , it is found that its relative velocity to m31 at 50 kpc is slightly above the escape velocity which is quite expected for tidal material ejected from a merger .",
    "second , the travel time to reach the milky way is ranging from 4 to 8 gyrs , depending on the axis ratio of the milky way potential ( see table 3 ) .",
    "@xcite estimated that if m31 have experienced a gaseous rich major merger , it should have occurred 5 - 8 gyrs ago on the basis of the age of the m31 disk stars .",
    "indeed in such an event most stars in the rebuilt disk should have ages slightly smaller than the merger look - back time .",
    "the origin of the magellanic clouds is still an enigma as they are the only blue , gas rich irregular in the immediate outskirts of the milky way .",
    "our proposition has the advantage of explaining them in a consistent way , as being originating from the most massive body in the local group that show evidences for a very rich merger history .",
    "future measurements of the m31 transverse velocity ( possibly with gaia ) may confirm or infirm its validity .",
    "further modeling of both lmc and smc could be done to verify whether their internal structures ( e.g. the lmc bar ) and their star formation history ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be reproduced .",
    "important tests of our hypothesis may come from better estimates of the dark matter content of the lmc ( could it be a tidal dwarf if it has a total mass as adopted by @xcite ? ) and from verifying whether it is consistent with the numerous features found in the outskirts of the milky way .",

    "we warmly thank jim peebles for enlightening discussions about the motion and mass of the lmc .",
