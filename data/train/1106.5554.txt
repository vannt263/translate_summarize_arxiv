    "here are several examples of correlated electrical conductance and raman response from nanojunctions with opv3 assembled on them . in the first three examples ( figures s1 - 3 ) the electrical conductance is on the order of 0.01  @xmath16 with conductance fluctuations on the order of 0.001  @xmath16 .",
    "the conductance fluctuations are correlated with large changes in the raman response measured at the nanojunction .",
    "this is consistent with a single molecule switching between different conformations in the nanojunction . in all of these cases",
    ", we expect that the molecule is not neatly bridging the gap , but does play a role in total electrical conduction .",
    "it has long been established[s2-s4 ] that conduction in such nanojunctions takes place via tunneling . because of the exponential dependence of tunneling on distance , the dominant volume for current flow is of molecular scale . as argued previously[s5 ] , coincident conductance and raman changes imply ( 1 ) that at least some portion of a raman - active molecule is influencing the tunneling electrons ; and ( 2 ) that raman - active molecule is a significant ( in many cases dominant ) contributor to the total raman signal .    at higher nanojunction conductances ( 0.5  @xmath16 , such as those observed in figure s4 )",
    ", we observe similar correlations between conduction and raman response , but the conductance fluctuation magnitude is much larger , as one might expect . at this conductance level , conduction is likely dominated by an atomic - scale metallic junction with transmission less than one .",
    "( one example of such a junction would be the beginnings of a tunneling contact , with two tip atoms slightly farther apart than their equilibrium lattice spacing . ) again , the conduction path is highly localized , with a transverse dimension of molecular or atomic dimensions .",
    "still , given the correlation between raman response and conductance , at least one raman - active molecule must be significantly coupled to this current path .",
    "we note that it is very unlikely that the unusually high conductance of this particular junction results from many molecules in parallel .",
    "if this was the case , the observed , correlated conduction and raman response would imply many molecules changing their configurations simultaneously , which is very unlikely .",
    "one would expect conductance fluctuations due to individual molecular motions to be much smaller such as those seen in nanojunctions with conductances of 0.01  @xmath16 ; however this is not the case . instead",
    ", high conductance nanojunctions are likely bridged by or strongly electronically coupled to just a part of a molecule , as the gaps are too small ( based upon the conductance ) to fit an entire molecule .",
    "figure  [ fig : junctioncartoon ] presents schematic examples of possible nanojunction configurations . fig .",
    "[ fig : junctioncartoon]a shows the idealized single - molecule junction that has been considered for more than fifteen years , with a single molecule neatly bridging and bound to both ends of a nanoscale interelectrode gap . in such a geometry , it is clear that interelectrode conduction would have a dominant contribution from current flow through the molecule .",
    "however , as mentioned in the main text , this ideal configuration is unlikely in electromigrated junctions , since the electromigration process ( unlike mechanical break junctions or scanning tunneling microscope junctions , for example ) does not control interelectrode distance with atomic precision .",
    "rather , the closest interelectrode distance is determined by details of individual junctions and the breaking procedure .",
    "[ fig : junctioncartoon]b - d are examples of other nanojunction geometries , in which the closest interelectrode distance is _ not _ the length of a molecule of interest . in fig .",
    "[ fig : junctioncartoon]b and d , only a portion of the molecule of interest may be located at the point of closest interelectrode separation , while steric effects prevent the molecule from forming strong bonds with both electrodes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : junctioncartoon]c , the molecule is bound to both electrodes , but a closer point of interelectrode separation exists , and due to the exponential decay of tunneling with distance , the total conductance would have a dominant contribution from direct metal - metal tunneling . these configurations , while only schematic , show clearly that many reasonable junction arrangements are possible that can have total conductances _ higher _ than the idealized situation in fig .",
    "[ fig : junctioncartoon]a , but nonetheless involve contributions from current flow through a molecule .",
    "an example from the literature of such a situation is thought to be presented in tal _",
    "et al._[s6 ] . in that work",
    ", a benzene molecule is thought to lie down flat between two pt electrodes in a mechanical break junction , leading to high conductance ( comparable to 1 @xmath16 ) , but still with molecular influence on the current .",
    "an example of optical vibrational pumping in opv3 is shown in figure s6 .",
    "we observe several discrete spectral configurations .",
    "each configuration has varying levels of optical pumping , with the most noticable change occuring at 150  s , when several lower energy vibrations appear in the antistokes signal .",
    "an additional example of electrical vibration pumping in opv3 is shown in figure s7 .",
    "the two modes observed 880  @xmath20 and 410  @xmath20 have temperature differences of almost 150  k at @xmath43  v. this device also exhibited optical pumping of both modes resulting in zero bias temperatures of 220  k and 120  k respectively . as expected both modes to not show any electrical pumping until @xmath0 exceeds the vibrational energy . at 280  mv a sharp change in conductance is observed and no pumping is observed .",
    "the conductance changes again at 320 mv and pumping is observed but with less as intensity than previously .",
    "this is strong evidence the importance of the local environment to pumping cross - sections .",
    "an additional example of electrical heating is shown in figure s8 .",
    "this sample had more symmetric @xmath44 curves and power dissipation than other samples presented .",

    "<S> this suggests that local vibrational relaxation to the substrate takes place via other means , such as coupling to phonons of reduced dimensionality . </S>",

    "<S> the vibrations at 1480  @xmath20 and 562  @xmath20 show a strong asymmetry similar to the conductance , while the 1815  @xmath20 mode shows very little asymmetry . </S>",

    "<S> 4a we see a roughly 150  k change in temperature over a 400  mv change in bias . </S>",
    "<S> there is asymmetry in both the temperature and current as a function of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> one possible explanation for this would be that only one electrode gets hot at a time , depending on the direction of current flow , and the thermal coupling to the bulk is different for each side of the nanogap . </S>",
    "<S> an increase of @xmath15 roughly linear in @xmath0 is consistent with a general argument based on steady state heat flow in the electron system@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the observation of effective electronic heating with bias in nanoscale junctions is important . </S>",
    "<S> while it is expected on general grounds@xcite , the landauer - bttiker approach to conduction , commonly used to model such junctions , does not account for such an effect . </S>",
    "<S> additional experimental consequences would be expected , including broadening of inelastic electron tunneling spectra at high biases under similar current densities , and signatures of heating in the junction current noise . </S>",
    "<S> investigations in these directions are ongoing .    </S>",
    "<S> there are _ systematic _ uncertainties in the effective vibrational and electronic temperatures ( due to the unknown values of @xmath8 and the lack of a detailed theory of the electronic raman continuum ) </S>",

    "<S> the resulting data are among the first direct measurements that will allow specific tests of theoretical treatments@xcite of thermal dissipation at the nanoscale . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that there can be great variation in electron - vibrational couplings and vibration - bulk relaxation rates ; with weak relaxation to the bulk , electrical pumping could access vibrational temperatures comparable to @xmath28 . </S>",

    "<S> samples were then cooled to 80  k in vacuum .    </S>",
    "<S> nanogaps were formed in the nanowires via the electromigration process which has been studied extensively . </S>",
    "<S> gap formation was performed with an automated computer program which stopped the electromigration process once the electrical conduction dropped below @xmath30 - the quanta of conductance .    </S>",
    "<S> after electromigration optical measurements were performed by illuminating the sample surface at 785  nm with a gaussian laser beam with a spot size of 1.9  @xmath31 m , incident intensity of 23  kw/@xmath32 , and polarization aligned along the nanowire . </S>",
    "<S> the laser beam was rastered over the sample and a spatial map of the raman response of the si substrate was measured at 520  @xmath20 as described in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the sers signal may also be spatial mapped to confirm that it originates from the nanogap . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra were all corrected to adjust for the spectral sensitivity of the system over the measured wavelength range , by calibrating to a known blackbody source ( @xmath9=2960  k ) . </S>",
    "<S> integration times for sers spectra during voltage sweeps ranged from 5  s to 10  s depending on signal strength .    </S>",

    "<S> the lock - in amplifier applied a 10  mv ac signal to the sample and measures the first harmonic response ( @xmath33 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a summing amplifier is used to add a dc signal ( @xmath0 ) to the lock - in signal allowing the current amplifier to measure @xmath34 . in this configuration </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be measured simultaneously as functions of @xmath0 .    to avoid concerns about thermal broadening or extrinsic ( detector - limited ) broadening of raman peaks , </S>",
    "<S> the effective temperature analyses were performed based on absolute peak height above baseline rather than integrated intensity over some wavenumber range . </S>",
    "<S> error estimates take into consideration the fact that the peak heights have a @xmath36 noise , where @xmath37 is the number of ccd counts over baseline .    * </S>",
