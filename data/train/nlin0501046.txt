    "coupled dynamical systems often arise in nature whenever a collective or cooperative phenomenon is favoured  @xcite . in particular , the coupled map lattice with diffusive coupling ( cml ) provides a prototype model to study various features associated with the cooperative evolution of constituent systems  @xcite .",
    "one of the important properties of such cmls is that they exhibit size instability , that is , there is a critical size on the number of constituents for which stable synchronous chaotic state exists . increasing the number of constituents beyond this limit leads to the occurrence of spatially incoherent behaviour ( eg .",
    ", high - dimensional chaos ) .",
    "for example , bohr and christensen  @xcite have studied such size instability behaviour in a two - dimensional coupled logistic lattice .",
    "similar desynchronization has been found in arrays of coupled systems represented by nonlinear oscillators  @xcite .",
    "the stability of synchronous chaos in coupled dynamical systems plays an important role in the study of pattern formation , spatiotemporal chaos , etc .",
    "@xcite .    in general",
    ", these studies on size instability are valid in most situations .",
    "however , we have noted that in certain circumstances there is an ambiguity in dealing with these systems below the critical system sizes . to be specific , there exist certain nontrivial ranges of initial conditions for which the cml admits spatial and temporally periodic solutions in contrast to the usually expected stable synchronous chaos . in this brief report",
    ", we show numerically the coexistence of such periodic states with the stable synchronous chaotic state well below the critical system size and explain the underlying mechanism .",
    "consider an one - dimensional coupled map lattice with nearest - neighbour diffusive coupling  @xcite @xmath0 , \\label{cml}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 @xmath2 represents the lattice sites and @xmath3 is the system size , subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the stability analysis of the synchronized chaotic state defined by @xmath4 in the above cml using the procedure derived originally for coupled oscillators by heagy _ et al _",
    "@xcite , gives the relation connecting transverse lyapunov exponents ( tles ) , in terms of the lyapunov exponent of single ( isolated ) map , @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "\\label{tr_lya}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the synchronous state is stable only if the tles ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) are all negative .    the above relation ( [ tr_lya ] )",
    "can also be obtained by means of a direct perturbation of the form @xmath9 as considered by bohr and christensen  @xcite .",
    "the synchronous state loses its stability when the long waves ( lowest mode ) are unstable  @xcite .",
    "this means that for @xmath10 the synchronous state is unstable .",
    "thus , substituting @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ tr_lya ] ) , one obtains the maximum / critical lattice size @xmath12 that supports stable synchronous state as @xmath13 now , let us consider a coupled logistic lattice with diffusive coupling ( cll ) where each lattice site in eq .",
    "( [ cml ] ) is occupied by the logistic map @xmath14 in particular for the choice @xmath15 , the lyapunov exponent of single ( isolated ) map is positive ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) and chaotic . in this case , for coupling strength @xmath17 , the critical lattice size ( @xmath18 ) is found to be @xmath19 from eq .",
    "( [ lmax ] ) .",
    "that is , upto the lattice size @xmath19 the cll exhibits synchronous chaos and for lattice size @xmath20 the synchronization is found to be lost , thereby confirming the size instability in the diffusively coupled logistic lattices .",
    "when random initial conditions are assumed , in most cases , the above cll with diffusive coupling exhibits stable synchronous chaos for @xmath21 as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ lmax ] ) . however , there are certain ranges of initial conditions for which cll shows some interesting asynchronous spatiotemporal patterns even for @xmath22 . for    example , for @xmath23 and with the choice of initial conditions @xmath24 @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 or several nearby initial conditions , the cll exhibits a standing wave type pattern as shown in fig .",
    "[ n8dyn_n](a ) .",
    "but for the same lattice size , if we choose a different set of initial conditions , @xmath24 @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 or the nearby points , two standing waves with different amplitudes are produced within the cll as in fig .",
    "[ n8dyn_n](b ) .",
    "similarly a disturbed standing wave pattern as shown in fig .",
    "[ n8dyn_n](c ) is possible to be exhibited by the cll for many choices of initial conditions . a synchronous chaos , as one would expect for @xmath23 from the theory , is also exhibited by the cll as depicted in fig .  [ n8dyn_n](d ) , for most of the random choices of initial conditions .",
    "this kind of multiple stable solutions is also observed in the cll for other lattice sizes , namely @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 which are also less than @xmath18 .",
    "the occurrence of various spatiotemporal patterns for different lattice sizes of the cll and their percentage of occurrence are shown in table  [ tab_pattern ] . in order to quantify the percentage of occurrence of different spatiotemporal patterns , we have used @xmath45 sets of random initial conditions ( i.c.s ) in the interval @xmath46 to @xmath47 and identified the number of i.c.s which lead to a specific pattern as indicated in table  [ tab_pattern ] .",
    "we have further confirmed our assertion by analyzing the same systems in different computing environments such as intel pentium 4 , sun sparc server / workstation and compaq alpha workstation .",
    "in addition , by considering the whole cml of size @xmath3 as a single @xmath3-dimensional map we have verified that the above spatiotemporal periodic structures are essentially the stable fixed points of this map . for example , the periodic structure in fig .",
    "[ n8dyn_n](a ) represents a fixed of point of period-2 of the eight - dimensional map and the eigenvalues of the corresponding jacobian matrix all are having magnitude less than unity . in a similar fashion one can verify that all the periodic structures are the stable fixed points of corresponding periods .",
    "thus , in addition to the stable synchronized manifold , there exists other invariant sets corresponding to stable periodic structures .",
    ".the possible spatiotemporal patterns for different lattice sizes and their percentage of occurrence for the coupled logistic lattice sampled over a set of @xmath48 random initial conditions ( ic s ) .",
    "the parameters are fixed as @xmath15 in eq .",

    "( [ cml ] ) . here ,",
    "sw : standing wave , sync . : synchronized .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,>,^ , < , > \" , ]     [ table1 ]    so , if it is possible to control the coupling force to fall in the region which corresponds to a periodic solution , then one can obtain standing wave patterns irrespective of the size of the lattices .",
    "this is in fact possible by choosing appropriate initial conditions to each lattice point and this explains the occurrence of standing waves ( asynchronous ) as shown in figs .",
    "[ n8dyn_n](a ) and [ n8dyn_n](b ) in the cll well below the critical lattice size ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "similar explanation holds good for fig .",
    "[ n8dyn_n](c ) .",
    "the same principle is involved in the occurrence of standing waves even for @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "from a careful numerical analysis , we have observed that the nodes and antinodes of standing waves are formed at or very close to the upos    of the isolated logistic map . keeping this in mind",
    ", we propose an expression for the standing wave pattern  @xcite of the form @xmath51 where , @xmath52 where the discrete index @xmath53 corresponds to the lattice site , @xmath54 denotes the mode of the waves , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 represent the nodes and antinodes of different standing waves present in the pattern , which can take values from @xmath47 to @xmath57 and @xmath47 to @xmath58 , respectively and @xmath57 is the period of upo .",
    "also in the above equation ( [ swave ] ) , @xmath59 s represent the values of the upos of the isolated logistic map at the node of the @xmath55-th standing wave , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the absolute values of the differences between upos at the node and upos at high and low amplitudes at the antinodes of the @xmath55th standing waves , respectively . the wave patterns with one and two number of standing waves obtained using eq .",
    "( [ swave ] ) for @xmath62 are shown in fig .",
    "[ n8dyn_a ] , whereas for the same lattice size , the numerically obtained pattern which have been discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] is shown in figs .",
    "[ n8dyn_n](a ) and [ n8dyn_n](b ) .",
    "one observes that these two figures coincide very closely .",
    "in this report , we have pointed out that coupled map lattices with diffusice coupling exhibit multiple stable states for the same set of parameters with respect to the initial conditions .",
    "it has also been shown that by choosing appropriate initial conditions , one can obtain different standing wave type patterns for such coupled map lattices even for lattice size much less than the critical system size @xmath18 , where one normally would expect synchronized chaos .",
    "in addition , we have proposed the mechanism behind the occurrence of such standing wave patterns .",
