    "the spectacular giant flare ( gf ) of 2004 dec . 27 from the soft gamma repeater ( sgr ) 1806 - 20 is believed to have originated from a violent magnetic reconnection event in this magnetar @xcite .",
    "this sudden energy release of more than @xmath6ergs in gamma - rays ( assuming isotropic emission at a distance of 15 kpc - corbel & eikenberry 2004 ; mcclure - griffiths & gaensler 2005 ) managed to eject a significant amount of baryons , probably accompanied by some pairs and magnetic fields , from the neutron star @xcite . as this outflow interacted with the external medium , it powered an expanding radio afterglow @xcite at least 500 times more luminous than the only other radio afterglow detected from an sgr gf @xcite .",
    "after a steep decay ( @xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a rebrightening in the radio light curve was seen , starting at @xmath8days and peaking at @xmath9days @xcite , followed by a shallower decay .",
    "this is most naturally explained by the transition from free expansion to the sedov - taylor phase , which occurs when a sufficient mass of ambient medium is swept up @xcite .    in this _",
    "letter _ we report on @xmath10ghz and @xmath11ghz radio observations with the very large array ( vla ) of the nrao between 7 and 81 days after the gf .",
    "these observations are used to measure the size , shape , motion and polarization properties of the radio afterglow .",
    "vla observations of  began @xmath12days after the gf with the vla in its a configuration . here",
    "we report all @xmath10ghz and @xmath11ghz observations up through day 81 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the first 20 days of monitoring with a host of radio telescopes including the vla have previously been described by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "absolute flux calibration was obtained from a short observation of 3c286 during each run .",
    "phase calibration was determined by observations of the strong ( 0.75 jy ) but somewhat distant ( 5.78 deg ) calibrator pmn j1820 - 2528 , or ( from 2005 jan . 16 on ) the nearby ( 0.77 deg ) , and moderately strong ( 0.32 jy ) calibrator txs j1811 - 2055 with a cycle time of 3.5 minutes . from jan .",
    "16 onwards , the validity of the phase transfer at 8.5 ghz was checked by short observations of j1820 - 2528 every 15 minutes . in general",
    "the coherence was found to be better than 95% on j1820 - 2528 . for all observations except 2005 jan .",
    "3 the strong and unpolarized source , oq208 , was observed for 1 minute in order to permit solving for the instrumental polarization . for the data on jan .",
    "3 , leakage terms were transfered from observations of bl lac on 2005 jan .",
    "the absolute polarization angle was referenced to 3c286 for all epochs .",
    "in all observations reported here the radio afterglow of  is smaller than the naturally weighted synthesised beam . since the signal to noise is high , however , it is quite feasible to extract information about the size and shape of the source by fitting models to the visibility data . for each of the epochs",
    "we fit a two component model to the data for the  field .",
    "one elliptical , two - dimensional gaussian component ( with the 6 free parameters given in table 2 ) describes while a point source ( not listed ) was used to describe the radio nebula associated with the lbv star approximately 14 arcseconds to the east @xcite .",
    "other models for the radio afterglow , including an elliptical ring , a uniform sphere , an elliptical disk , and two point sources , were tried but not found to provide a better fit .",
    "fitting the vla data to an elliptical ring , or disk at any epoch increases the derived size by a factor @xmath21.16 and @xmath21.66 respectively as expected @xcite .",
    "the model fitting was performed in both miriad ( task uvfit ) and difmap and found to agree to within the uncertainties .",
    "we adopt the miriad fits ( table 2 ) and the estimated statistical errors . as in @xcite",
    "the error of the size was checked with monte - carlo simulations of the data using identical ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) coverage , similar noise properties , and a gaussian component of known size added .",
    "the simulations confirm the error estimates quoted by miriad , and agree with errors estimated from the signal to noise ratio and the synthesised beam shape .    in the early epochs",
    "there is some evidence from the merlin and vlba observations @xcite that the morphology of the source is more complicated than an elliptical gaussian , and may experience rapid changes in the location of the peak emission .",
    "these changes in the suface brightness could cause shifts in the centroid of our model fits , and deviations in the fitted size .",
    "for this reason we have added a 10% error in quadrature to the measured size of all points , though the error may be larger in the earlier measurements . at later times",
    "1.4 ghz merlin observations seem to be more consistent with a smooth elliptical gaussian .",
    "linear polarization from the radio afterglow was detected during the first 20 days after the gf at 8.5 ghz @xcite .",
    "thereafter we were only able to measure upper limits on the polarization ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the polarization is found to be 2.1% on day 7 and to decrease to a minimum of 1.1% on day 10 . at that time",
    "the linear polarization began to increase steadily to a maximum value of 3.4 % while the polarization angle swung rapidly from 4@xmath5 to 40@xmath5 .",
    "the polarization falls below our detection limit of 2% around the time of the rebrightening in the light curve .",
    "limits as late as 55 days after the gf are below 2% .      in fig .  2 we plot the geometric mean diameter of the elliptical gaussian model fits .",
    "these fits show the expansion of the radio afterglow from  over the first 81 days after the gf . as reported in @xcite",
    "was clearly resolved in the earliest vla observations taken 7 days after the gf with a diameter of @xmath257 mas ( mean full - width ) .",
    "merlin observations @xcite reveal that the source could be asymmetric .",
    "the size and position angle of the merlin extension at @xmath431 degrees is roughly consistent with our average value of @xmath440 @xmath0 20 .",
    "there is some possible evidence for a gradual swing in the position angle of the vla data ( table 2 ) , and we will investigate its significance in a future paper . assuming a one - sided expansion ( as argued in  5 ) , the apparent velocity required to reach a size of 57 mas in 6.9 days is 8.3 @xmath0 0.9 mas / day ( 0.72 @xmath0 0.10 @xmath15 ) .",
    "after 30 days ( the time of the rebrightening reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the radio afterglow had grown to @xmath16mas ( full - width of the geometric mean of the major and minor axes ) . between 7 and 30 days",
    "the growth of the radio nebula from 57 mas to 260 mas corresponds to an average expansion velocity of 9.0 @xmath0 1.6 mas / day ( 0.78 @xmath0 0.14 @xmath15 ) . after this time",
    ", the growth appears to slow so that the average velocity between day 30 and the last day of observations reported here is 1.0 @xmath0 2 mas / day ( @xmath17 ) where the source size reaches @xmath2322 mas .",
    "this expansion is in agreement with the merlin size estimate of @xmath2220 mas ( mean full - width ) , 56 days after the gf .    following @xcite ( see their eq .",
    "4 ) , we fit to the data from day 9 onwards a supersonically expanding spherical shell that is decelerated as it sweeps up material .",
    "while the deceleration of an anisotropic outflow might be somewhat different than in the spherical case , the latter may still serve as a rough approximation .",
    "the fit ( reduced @xmath18 of 0.76 ; shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "2 ) implies a deceleration time of 40 @xmath0 13 days after the gf , consistent with the time of the peak rebrightening at day @xmath230 and the deceleration time of @xmath246 days derived from the rebrightening @xcite .",
    "we also fit a constant expansion ( 5.6 @xmath0 0.6 mas / day ) to the data and obtain a reduced @xmath18 of 1.22 .",
    "an f - test gives a probability of 2% that the constant expansion is an equally valid description of the data .",
    "a broken power - law actually fits much better than either model ( reduced @xmath18 = 0.06 ) , but requires both acceleration and deceleration of the explosion .",
    "good astrometry was obtained for the radio afterglow from  on all days of the observations except 2005 jan .",
    "3 , jan . 10 , and feb . 7 via phase referencing to a nearby calibrator .",
    "a combination of a long cycle time ( 15 min ) , distant calibrator ( j1820 - 2528 ) , and poor atmospheric phase stability resulted in a large systematic position error on jan . 3 , though changes in the relative brightness of different parts of the image @xcite may also have affected the centroid position .",
    "10 the low elevation of the observations forced us to employ a distant calibrator with a poor position . on feb .",
    "7 poor weather caused unstable phase conditions such that the coherence estimated on j1820 - 2528 was only 36% .",
    "the centroid of the radio afterglow from  is found to shift by @xmath2200 mas over the course of 70 days of observations ( fig .",
    "we have decomposed this shift into x and y components ( table  2 ) and performed least squares fits to the motion .",
    "the radial proper motion is 3.0 @xmath0 0.34 mas / day at a position angle of @xmath444 @xmath0 6 @xmath5 ( measured north through east ) .",
    "this motion corresponds to @xmath19 .",
    "there is some indication that the time of fastest proper motion also corresponds to the time of fastest growth .",
    "the motion of the radio flux centroid is along the major axis of the source and is roughly half of the growth rate .",
    "this may be naturally explained by a predominantly one - sided outflow , which produces a radio nebula extending from the location of the magnetar out to an increasing distance in the direction of the ejection .",
    "this suggests that either the catastrophic reconfiguration of the magnetic field which caused the gf was relatively localized , rather than a global event involving the whole magnetar ( c.f .",
    "* ) , or that the baryonic content of the ejecta is asymmetric .",
    "it is also possible that the environment plays a role in collimating the outflow .",
    "the position angle of the linear polarization is roughly perpendicular to the major axis of the image and to the direction of motion of the flux centroid .",
    "this naturally arises for a shock - produced magnetic field , which is tangled predominantly within the plane of the shock @xcite , because of the elongated shape of the emitting region and due to projection effects @xcite .",
    "alternatively , this might be caused by shearing motion along the sides of the one - sided outflow , which can stretch the magnetic field in the emitting region along its direction of motion .",
    "the degree of polarization decreased at about the same time as the deceleration and rebrightening in the light curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] ) . as the rebrightening",
    "is attributed to the emission from the shocked external medium becoming dominant @xcite , this suggests a lower polarization of this emission component .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that the magnetic field in the shocked ism is less ordered than in the shocked ejecta and/or shocked external shell .    in the first 30 days , the outer edge of the radio afterglow moves away from the magnetar position at an apparent velocity of 0.8 c. the intrinsic velocity could be lower depending on the unknown inclination of the outflow .",
    "the minimum velocity is 0.62 c for an angle of the outflow with the line - of - sight of 51@xmath5 .",
    "this is in agreement with the high escape velocity of 0.5 c for a neutron star . at these trans - relativistic velocities ( lorentz factor 1.3 )",
    "there is a modest increase in the total kinetic energy of the outflow .",
    "compared to previous estimates based on isotropic outflows @xcite , the energy is increased by a factor of 2 - 3 owing to the factor 2 higher velocity at the outer edge , but lower velocities elsewhere @xcite .",
    "combining these two factors leads to a revised estimate for the total kinetic energy in the ejecta of @xmath210@xmath20 ergs . by momentum conservation , a one - sided outflow of @xmath21 g @xcite at 0.62",
    "c imparts a kick to the magnetar of 30 cm s@xmath22 .",
    "we report a deceleration in the observed expansion of the radio afterglow produced by the 2004 dec .",
    "27 giant flare from .",
    "we also find a proper motion for the radio afterglow roughly aligned with its major axis and perpendicular to the average polarization angle .",
    "these observations support the idea of an asymmetric explosion on one side of the magnetar .",
    "the polarization data place significant constraints on the magnetic field structure in the shocked ejecta and ism .",
    "measurements with the vla continue , and will be presented in a future paper .",
