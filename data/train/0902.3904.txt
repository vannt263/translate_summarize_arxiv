    "in addition , if a vector field exists , anisotropic inflation can be possible @xcite against the cosmic no hair theorem .",
    "the vector field is also considered to explain the dark energy problem@xcite .",
    "however , most of the vector field models are plagued by instabilities or by the ghost modes @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we consider a timelike vector field instead of a spacelike vector field@xcite in order to preserve an isotropic background spacetime and investigate if this vector field can give rise to an accelerating phase . unlike spacelike vector field inflation@xcite ,",
    "the nonminimal coupling to gravity with a timelike vector field could not help to generate an inflationary period@xcite .",
    "instead , we try to find a vector field potential which can give rise to a successful inflationary expansion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : background ] we describe our model and derive the background equations of motion .",
    "we discuss about the conditions for the vector field potential to be satisfied in section [ sec : potential ] and apply to the several potentials .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "we begin with an action of a vector field which has a general quadratic kinetic term@xcite @xmath2 , \\label{oriaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is a vector field potential . for a massive vector field , @xmath6 .",
    "we can consider the general form of the potential in addition to the linear massive potential @xcite .    here",

    "the standard maxwell kinetic term , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , corresponds to @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , they have categorized into several models in terms of @xmath7 s . among those models , @xmath12 model , @xmath13 model and @xmath14 model , where @xmath15 , seem to be free from linear instabilities or negative - energy ghosts .    in our previous work@xcite , we have considered @xmath16 case and",
    "the kinetic lagrangian density of the vector field becomes @xmath17 this kinetic model is dubbed as a `` sigma model '' in ref .",
    "@xcite and is stable under the small perturbations . up to the total derivative terms where we have used @xmath18a^{\\mu } = r_{\\mu\\nu}a^{\\mu}$ ] . ]",
    "another interesting case is @xmath19 or @xmath20 and the model is defined by the form @xmath21 the background dynamics of a vector field with this lagrangian density can not be discriminated from that of ( [ lagrangian1 ] ) , which will be shown later .",
    "we can also think of @xmath22 case which is given by the form @xmath23 unlike ( [ lagrangian1 ] ) and ( [ lagrangian2 ] ) , this model has @xmath24 .",
    "this model may have a superluminal mode@xcite , which means that the dynamical degree of freedom can propagate faster than light and lead to instabilities .",
    "the equation of motion obtained by varying the action ( [ oriaction ] ) with respect to @xmath25 is @xmath26 where @xmath27    and by varying the action with respect to @xmath28 , one obtains einstein equations @xmath29   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\mu\\nu } { k^{\\alpha\\beta}}_{\\rho\\sigma}\\nabla_{\\alpha}a^{\\rho } \\nabla_{\\beta}a^{\\sigma } + 2\\frac{dv}{d\\xi}a_{\\mu}a _ { \\nu }   -g_{\\mu\\nu}v(\\xi ) .",

    ", @xmath46 should be much smaller than @xmath47 .",
    "but as long as @xmath48 , @xmath49 if @xmath50 or @xmath51 if @xmath52 . only for @xmath53 , there would be a possibility of @xmath54 when @xmath55 is satisfied .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we only focus on @xmath56 case in what follows .    in order to check the possibility of the inflationary expansion with the vector field , we require the following three minimal conditions one would expect a successful inflation model to satisfy : i)@xmath57 ii ) @xmath58 and iii ) @xmath59 .",
    "first condition is required in order to have a positive energy density , second is for an accelerating expansion and the final one is for slow - roll inflation .",
    "then we could find a vector field potential to satisfy these conditions .",
    "we can summarize the above three requirements as @xmath60 and @xmath61 . with these conditions , @xmath62 and the number of efolds",
