    "the equivariant stable homotopy category is of fundamental importance in algebraic topology .",
    "it is the natural home in which to study equivariant stable homotopy theory , a subject that has powerful and unexpected nonequivariant applications . for recent examples ,",
    "it plays a central role in the solution of the kervaire invariant problem by hill , hopkins , and ravenel , it is central to calculations of topological cyclic homology and therefore to calculations in algebraic k - theory made by angeltveit , gerhardt , hesselholt , lindenstrauss , madsen , and others , and it plays an interesting role by analogy and comparision in the work of voevodsky and others in motivic stable homotopy theory .",
    "it is also of great intrinsic interest .",
    "setting up the equivariant stable homotopy category with its attendant model structures takes a fair amount of work .",
    "the original version was due to lewis and may @xcite and more modern versions that we shall start from are given in @xcite .",
    "a result of schwede and shipley @xcite , reproven in @xcite , asserts that any stable model category @xmath1 is equivalent to a category @xmath2 of spectrally enriched presheaves with values in a chosen category @xmath3 of spectra .",
    "however , the domain @xmath3-category @xmath4 is a full @xmath3-subcategory of @xmath1 and typically is as inexplicit and mysterious as @xmath1 itself . from the point of view of applications and calculations , this is therefore only a starting point .",
    "one wants a more concrete understanding of the category @xmath4 . we shall give explicit equivalents to the domain category @xmath4 in the case when @xmath5 is the category of @xmath0-spectra for a finite group @xmath0 , and we fix a finite group @xmath0 throughout .",
    "we shall define an @xmath3-category ( or spectral category ) @xmath6 by applying a suitable infinite loop space machine to simply defined categories of finite @xmath0-sets .",
    "the letter @xmath7 stands for `` burnside '' , and @xmath6 is a spectrally enriched version of the burnside category of @xmath0 .",
    "we shall prove the following result .",
    "there is a zig - zag of quillen equivalences @xmath8 relating the category of @xmath0-spectra to the category of spectrally enriched contravariant functors @xmath9 .    as usual",
    ", we call such functors presheaves . we reemphasize the simplicity of our spectral category @xmath6 : no prior knowledge of @xmath0-spectra is required to define it .",
    "we give a precise description of the relevant categorical input and restate the main theorem more precisely in  1 .",
    "the central point of the proof is to use equivariant infinite loop space theory to construct the spectral category @xmath6 from elementary categories of finite @xmath0-sets .",
    "we prove our main theorem in  2 , using the equivariant barratt - priddy - quillen ( bpq ) theorem to compare @xmath6 to the spectral category @xmath10 given by the suspension @xmath0-spectra @xmath11 of based finite @xmath0-sets @xmath12 .",
    "it is crucial to our work that these @xmath0-spectra are self - dual .",
    "our original proof (  [ atiyah ] ) took this as a special case of equivariant atiyah duality , thinking of @xmath13 as a trivial example of a smooth closed @xmath0-manifold .",
    "we later found a direct categorical proof (  [ selfish ] ) of this duality based on equivariant infinite loop space theory and the equivariant bpq theorem .",
    "this allows us to give an illuminating new proof of the required self - duality as we go along .",
    "we give an alternative model for the category of @xmath0-spectra in terms of classical atiyah duality in  [ secat ] .",
    "we take what we need from equivariant infinite loop space theory as a black box in this paper , deferring the proofs of all but one detail to a sequel @xcite , with that detail deferred to another sequel @xcite .",
    "we thank a diligent referee for demanding a reorganization of our original paper .",
    "we also thank angelica osorno and inna zakharevich for very helpful comments .",
    "we first define the @xmath3-category @xmath6 and restate our main theorem .",
    "we shall avoid categorical apparatus , but conceptually @xmath6 is obtained by applying a nonequivariant infinite loop space machine @xmath16 to a category @xmath17 `` enriched in permutative categories '' .",
    "the term in quotes can be made categorically precise @xcite , but we shall use it just as an informal slogan since no real categorical background is necessary to our work : we shall give direct elementary definitions of the examples we use , and they do satisfy the axioms specified in the cited sources .",
    "we then define a @xmath0-category @xmath18 `` enriched in permutative @xmath0-categories '' , from which @xmath17 is obtain by passage to @xmath0-fixed subcategories .",
    "finally , we outline the proof of the main theorem , which is obtained by applying an equivariant infinite loop space machine @xmath19 to @xmath18 .      in any category @xmath20 with pullbacks , the bicategory of spans in @xmath20 has @xmath21-cells the objects of @xmath20 .",

    "the associativity and unit constraints are determined by the universal property of pullbacks .",
    "observe that the @xmath22-cells @xmath24 can just as well be viewed as objects over @xmath29 .",
    "viewed this way , the identity @xmath22-cells are given by the diagonal maps @xmath30 .",
    "our starting point is the bicategory of spans of finite @xmath0-sets . here",
    "the disjoint union of @xmath0-sets over @xmath29 gives us a symmetric monoidal structure on the category of @xmath22-cells and @xmath23-cells @xmath24 for each pair @xmath31 .",
    "we can think of the bicategory of spans as a category `` enriched in the category of symmetric monoidal categories '' .",
    "again , the notion in quotes does not make obvious mathematical sense since there is no obvious monoidal structure on the category of symmetric monoidal categories , but category theory due to the first author @xcite ( see also @xcite ) explains what these objects are and how to rigidify them to categories enriched in permutative categories .",
    "we repeat that we have no need to go into such categorical detail . rather than apply such category theory , we give a direct elementary construction of a strict structure that is equivalent to the intuitive notion of the category `` enriched in symmetric monoidal categories '' of spans of finite @xmath0-sets .    we first define a bipermutative category @xmath32 equivalent to the symmmetric bimonoidal category of finite @xmath0-sets . any finite @xmath0-set is isomorphic to a finite @xmath0-set of the form @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is a homomorphism @xmath36 , and @xmath0 acts on @xmath37 by @xmath38 for @xmath39 . _",

    "the morphisms of @xmath32 are the isomorphisms @xmath44 of @xmath0-sets .",
    "the disjoint union @xmath45 of finite @xmath0-sets @xmath46 and @xmath47 is @xmath48 , with @xmath49 being the evident block sum @xmath50 . with the evident commutativity isomorphism ,",
    "this gives the permutative category @xmath32 of finite @xmath0-sets ; the empty finite @xmath0-set is the unit for @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , the cartesian product @xmath52 of @xmath53 and @xmath54 is @xmath55 where the set @xmath56 is identified with @xmath57 , ordered lexicographically , and @xmath58 is the evident block product . there is again an evident commutativity isomorphism , and @xmath51 and @xmath59 give @xmath60 a structure of bipermutative category in the sense of @xcite ; the multiplicative unit is the trivial @xmath0-set @xmath61 , where @xmath62 for @xmath43",
    ".    we may view @xmath32 as the category of finite @xmath0-sets over the one point @xmath0-set @xmath22 , and we generalize the definition as follows .    for a finite @xmath0-set @xmath13",
    ", we define a permutative category @xmath63 of finite @xmath0-sets over @xmath13 .",
    "the objects of @xmath63 are the @xmath0-maps @xmath64 .",

    "disjoint union of @xmath0-sets over @xmath13 gives @xmath63 a structure of permutative category ; its unit is the empty set over @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath69 , @xmath63 is the ( `` additive '' ) permutative category of the previous definition .",
    "there is also a product @xmath70 .",
    "it takes @xmath71 to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are finite @xmath0-sets over @xmath13 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "this product is also strictly associative and unital , with unit the unit of @xmath32 , and it has an evident commutativity isomorphism .",
    "restriction to the object @xmath22 gives the `` multiplicative '' permutative category of .",
    "this product distributes over @xmath51 and makes the enriched category @xmath17 of the next definition into a `` strict symmetric monoidal category enriched in permutative categories '' in a sense defined in @xcite .",
    "we define a category @xmath17 `` enriched in permutative categories '' as follows .",
    "the @xmath21-cells of @xmath17 are the finite @xmath0-sets , which may be thought of as the categories @xmath63 .",
    "the permutative category @xmath73 of @xmath22-cells and @xmath23-cells @xmath24 is @xmath74 , as defined in .",
    "the composition @xmath75 is defined via pullbacks , as in the diagram ( [ pbdiag ] ) .",
    "precisely , the pullback @xmath76 is the sub @xmath0-set of @xmath77 consisting of the elements @xmath78 such that @xmath79 and @xmath80 map to the same element @xmath81 .",
    "this composition is strictly associative and unital .",
    "we are suppressing some categorical details .",
    "the composition distributes over coproducts , and it should be defined on a `` tensor product '' rather than a cartesian product of permutative categories .",
    "such a tensor product does in fact exist @xcite , but we shall not use the relevant category theory .",
    "rather we will change notation to @xmath82 since the composition is a pairing that gives rise to a pairing defined on the smash product of the spectra constructed from @xmath83 and @xmath73 .",
    "it is helpful to observe that the composition just defined can be viewed as a composite of maps of finite @xmath0-sets induced contravariantly and covariantly by the maps of finite @xmath0-sets @xmath84_-{\\id \\times \\de\\times \\id } c\\times b\\times a \\ar[rr]^-{\\pi } & & c\\times a , \\\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the projection .    before beginning work",
    ", we recall an old result that motivated this paper . the category @xmath86 $ ] of @xmath0-spans is obtained from the bicategory @xmath17 of @xmath0-spans by identifying spans from @xmath13 to @xmath72 if there is an isomorphism between them .",
    "composition is again by pullbacks .",
    "we add spans from @xmath13 to @xmath72 by taking disjoint unions , and that gives the morphism set @xmath86(a , b)$ ] a structure of abelian monoid .",
    "we apply the grothendieck construction to obtain an abelian group of morphisms @xmath24 .",
    "this gives an additive category @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "the following result is ( * ? ? ?",
    "* v.9.6 ) .",
    "let @xmath88 denote the full subcategory of the homotopy category @xmath89 of @xmath0-spectra whose objects are the @xmath0-spectra @xmath11 , where @xmath13 runs over the finite @xmath0-sets .",
    "the categories @xmath88 and @xmath87 $ ] are isomorphic .",
    "infinite loop space theory associates a spectrum @xmath90 to a permutative category @xmath91 .",
    "there are several equivalent machines available . for definiteness , and because we have used it in working out the details , we use a modernized version of @xcite that lands in the category @xmath3 of orthogonal spectra @xcite .",
    "precise details are given in @xcite . with this choice",
    ", the zeroth space of @xmath90 is the classifying space @xmath92 .",
    "the objects @xmath93 are the vertices of the nerve of @xmath91 and thus are points of @xmath92 .",
    "therefore each @xmath94 determines a map @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the sphere spectrum . for any @xmath91",
    ", @xmath90 is a positive @xmath97-spectrum ( @xcite ) such that its structure map @xmath98 is a group completion .",
    "since @xmath3 is closed symmetric monoidal under the smash product , it makes sense to enrich categories in @xmath3 .",
    "our preferred version of spectral categories is categories enriched in @xmath3 , abbreviated @xmath3-categories .",
    "model theoretically , @xmath3 is a particularly nice enriching category since its unit @xmath96 is cofibrant in the stable model structure and @xmath3 satisfies the monoid axiom @xcite .",
    "when a spectral category @xmath4 is used as the domain category of a presheaf category , the objects and maps of the underlying category are unimportant .",
    "the important data are the morphism spectra @xmath99 , the unit maps @xmath100 , and the composition maps @xmath101 the presheaves @xmath102 can be thought of as ( right ) @xmath4-modules .",
    "we define a spectral category @xmath6 .",
    "its objects are the finite @xmath0-sets @xmath13 , which may be viewed as the spectra @xmath103 .",
    "its morphism spectra @xmath104 are the spectra @xmath105 .",
    "its unit maps @xmath106 are induced by the points @xmath107 and its composition @xmath108 is induced by composition in @xmath17 .    as written , the definition makes little sense : to make the word `` induced '' meaningful requires properties of the infinite loop space machine @xmath16 that we will spell out in  [ gmsum ] .",
    "once this is done , we will have the presheaf category @xmath109 of @xmath3-functors @xmath110 and and @xmath3-natural transformations . as shown for example in @xcite",
    ", it is a cofibrantly generated model category enriched in @xmath3 , or @xmath3-model category for short . as shown in @xcite , the category @xmath111 of ( genuine ) orthogonal @xmath0-spectra is also an @xmath3-model category .",
    "our main theorem can be restated as follows .",
    "there is a zigzag of enriched quillen equivalences connecting the @xmath3-model categories @xmath111 and @xmath109 .",
    "therefore @xmath0-spectra can be thought of as constructed from the very elementary category @xmath17 enriched in permutative categories , ordinary nonequivariant spectra , and the black box of infinite loop space theory .",
    "the following reassuring result falls out of the proof .",
    "let @xmath112 denote the orbit category of @xmath0 .",
    "for a @xmath0-spectrum @xmath113 , passage to @xmath114-fixed point spectra for @xmath115 defines a functor @xmath116 .",
    "analogously , a presheaf @xmath117 restricts to a functor @xmath118 .",
    "the zigzag of equivalences induces a natural zigzag of equivalences between the fixed point orbit functor on @xmath0-spectra and the restriction to orbits of presheaves ; thus , if @xmath113 corresponds to @xmath119 , then @xmath120 is equivalent to @xmath121 .",
    "there is an important missing ingredient needed for a fully satisfactory theory : we have not described the behavior of smash products under the equivalences of .",
    "this problem deserves study both in our work and in related work of others .",
    "the obvious guess is that @xmath109 is symmetric monoidal and the zigzag connecting it to @xmath111 is a zigzag of symmetric monoidal quillen equivalences .",
    "we see how the problem can be attacked , but we also have reason to believe that the obvious guess may be wrong .",
    "we intend to return to this question elsewhere .",
    "much of what we do applies to @xmath0-spectra indexed on an incomplete universe , provided that we restrict attention to those finite @xmath0-sets @xmath13 that embed in that universe , so that atiyah duality applies to the orbit @xmath0-spectra @xmath11 .",
    "by @xcite , duality fails for orbits that do not embed in the universe .",
    "unfortunately , however , the cited restriction leads to the wrong weak equivalences , since we are then only entitled to see the homotopy groups of @xmath114-fixed point spectra for those @xmath114 that embed in the given universe .",
    "everything we do depends on first working equivariantly and then passing to fixed points .",
    "following @xcite , we fix some generic notations . for a category @xmath20 ,",
    "let @xmath122 be the category of @xmath0-objects in @xmath20 and @xmath0-maps between them .",
    "let @xmath123 be the @xmath0-category of @xmath0-objects and nonequivariant maps , with @xmath0 acting by conjugation .",
    "the two categories are related conceptually by @xmath124 .",
    "the objects , being @xmath0-objects , are already @xmath0-fixed ; we apply the @xmath0-fixed point functor to hom sets .",
    "more generally , we can start with a category @xmath20 with actions by @xmath0 on its objects and again define a category @xmath122 of @xmath0-maps and a @xmath0-category @xmath123 with @xmath0-fixed category @xmath122 .",
    "we apply this framework to the category of finite @xmath0-sets .",
    "we have already defined the @xmath0-fixed bicategory @xmath17 , and we shall give two definitions of @xmath0-bicategories @xmath18 with fixed point bicategories equivalent to @xmath17 .",
    "the first , given in this section , is more intuitive , but the second is more convenient for the proof of our main theorem .    let @xmath125 be a countable @xmath0-set that contains all orbit types @xmath126 infinitely many times .",
    "again let @xmath13 , @xmath72 , and @xmath127 denote finite @xmath0-sets , but now let the @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath76 of  [ gspan ] be finite subsets of the @xmath0-set @xmath125 ; these subsets need _ not _ be @xmath0-subsets .",
    "the action of @xmath0 on @xmath125 gives rise to an action of @xmath0 on the finite subsets of @xmath125 : for a finite subset @xmath53 of @xmath125 and @xmath43 , @xmath128 is another finite subset of @xmath125 .",
    "we define a @xmath0-category @xmath129 .",
    "the objects of @xmath129 are the nonequivariant maps @xmath64 , where @xmath13 is a finite @xmath0-set and @xmath53 is a finite subset of @xmath125 .",
    "the morphisms @xmath130 , @xmath66 , are the bijections @xmath67 such that @xmath68 .",
    "the group @xmath0 acts on morphisms via the maps @xmath131 and the formula @xmath132 .",
    "we define a bicategory @xmath18 with objects the finite @xmath0-sets and with @xmath0-categories of morphisms between objects specified by @xmath133 .",
    "thinking of the objects of @xmath134 as nonequivariant spans @xmath135 , composition and units are defined as in .",
    "observe that taking disjoint unions of finite sets over @xmath13 will not keep us in @xmath125 and is thus not well - defined .",
    "therefore the @xmath129 are not symmetric monoidal ( let alone permutative ) @xmath0-categories in the naive sense of symmetric monoidal categories with @xmath0 acting compatibly on all data .",
    "in fact , the notion of a genuine permutative @xmath0-category , one that provides input for an equivariant infinite loop space machine , is subtle .",
    "we shall give two solutions to that categorical problem in @xcite .",
    "in both , genuine permutative @xmath0-categories are described in terms of actions by an @xmath136 operad of @xmath0-categories , to which equivariant infinite loop space theory applies .",
    "one solution gives each of the @xmath129 such a structure , but that is not the solution we shall use .",
    "the other solution starts from a less intuitive definition of @xmath18 and gives an equivalent way of solving that categorical problem .",
    "it uses a more convenient @xmath136 operad of @xmath0-categories , denoted @xmath137 .",
    "we give details of this operad in @xcite , where we define a genuine permutative @xmath0-category to be an algebra over @xmath137 .",
    "to give the idea , we apply our general point of view on equivariant categories to the category @xmath138 of small categories .",
