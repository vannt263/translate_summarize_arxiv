    "random tensor models are generalizations of random matrix models . they were introduced as a way to generalize the successful relationship between random matrices and two - dimensional quantum gravity ( see the classics @xcite and the more modern @xcite ) to higher dimensions .",
    "indeed , random matrix models are integrals over matrices of size @xmath1 which admit some @xmath0 expansions . at each order @xmath2 in the @xmath0 expansion ,",
    "the matrix integrals give rise to feynman diagrams which are ribbon graphs , or equivalently combinatorial maps , and represent discrete surfaces of genus @xmath3 .",
    "the original motivation behind tensor models for a tensor with @xmath4 indices is that their feynman diagrams represent gluings of @xmath5-dimensional building blocks .",
    "the original proposals of tensor models @xcite were plagued with difficulties .",
    "the feynman diagrams represent gluings of simplices which can be quite singular @xcite .",
    "moreover , no tensor models were known to admit a @xmath0 expansion ( where @xmath6 is the range of each index ) for twenty years .",
    "a reason which explains the absence of major development in tensor models for such a long time might have been the impossibility to generalize random matrix techniques .",
    "for instance , tensors can not be diagonalized which implies no reduction to eigenvalues and therefore no orthogonal polynomials . as a consequence ,",
    "methods to solve matrix models , such as the one considered in the present article , were not applicable as they rely on the existence of a @xmath0 expansion .",
    "tensor models have come a long way in the past six years .",
    "we now have at our disposal a family of building blocks known as _ bubbles _",
    "@xcite which generalize the unitary - invariant observables ( matrix traces ) of matrix models .",
    "matrix models use those invariant observables as potential : @xmath7 , in the case of single - trace interactions , where the term of order @xmath8 represents a @xmath9-gon to be used to form surfaces .",
    "similarly , bubbles are unitary - invariant polynomials in the tensor entries , which also represent simplicial building blocks : instead of @xmath8-gons which are gluings of @xmath8 triangles , one can have arbitrary _ colored _ gluings of @xmath5-simplices with a boundary .",
    "using those polynomials as potential in the tensor integrals gives feynman diagrams which are colored triangulations and which are classified according to some @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the fact that colored gluings of simplices emerges in modern tensor models is the reason why @xmath0 expansions exist and was the missing ingredient in the original tensor models ( see gurau s original @xmath0 expansion articles for the combinatorics of colored triangulations @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast with matrix models for which the @xmath0 expansion is the genus expansion for any choice of potential , the @xmath0 expansions in tensor models depend on the choice of bubbles @xcite .",
    "gurau s @xmath0 expansion , with respect to gurau s degree , exists for all tensor models but leads to trivial large @xmath6 limits when the bubbles used as potential do not fall in the class of melonic bubbles @xcite . in the case of melonic bubbles ,",
    "gurau s degree is the only way to get a @xmath0 expansion and it leads to very strong result , see gurau s universality theorem @xcite and its extension to almost - melonic bubbles @xcite .    for tensor models whose potential consist in non - melonic bubbles",
    ", it is then possible to recourse to other @xmath0 expansions , which depend on the choice of bubbles @xcite .",
    "some models for instance resemble matrix models and admit a genus - like expansion @xcite .",
    "recent efforts in tensor models have thus been organized in two directions :    * finding @xmath0 expansions and large @xmath6 limits for tensor models with non - melonic potentials , * solving tensor models to all order in their @xmath0 expansions .",
    "the first aspect is new compared to matrix models , but the second aspect is a typical problem in matrix models .",
    "therefore , one can try and extend methods developed for matrix integrals to tensor integrals in order to solve tensor models at all orders in their @xmath0 expansions .",
    "doing so however requires a good understanding of the large @xmath6 limit first , i.e. the first non - trivial order of the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "progress in identifying and solving large @xmath6 tensor models with non - melonic potentials is very recent and still limited .",
    "some strategies and applications have been presented in the review @xcite and in @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we will be interested in solving some tensor models at all orders in their @xmath0 expansions and we will therefore focus on cases which are better understood like the melonic case .",
    "one of the preferred strategies to do so in matrix models is by using schwinger - dyson equations , also known as loop equations in that context .",
    "schwinger - dyson equations are derived from the matrix integrals and form a sequence of equations which relate the expectation values of the unitary - invariant polynomials @xmath10 for different values of @xmath8 .",
    "loop equations can be rearranged as equations on the generating functions of products of traces , @xmath11 , known as the @xmath12-point functions .",
    "solving the loop equations at all orders in the @xmath0 expansion is then a difficult problem . a fascinating development known as",
    "the topological recursion has been put forward for the past ten years as it provides a recursive solution to the loop equations in a beautiful mathematical way @xcite .",
    "the topological recursion was developed in the context of matrix models and enumeration of combinatorial maps by eynard @xcite .",
    "it has since been found to be applicable to a much larger set of situations , leading to fascinating results in combinatorics , enumerative geometry @xcite , quantum topology @xcite and theoretical physics @xcite .",
    "the existence of a solution to a system of equations satisfying the topological recursion furthermore comes with additional , interesting properties , such as symplectic invariance and integrability .",
    "tensor models are based on tensor integrals which generalize matrix integrals .",
    "it is thus not unexpected that tensor models also give rise to schwinger - dyson equations which generalize those of matrix models @xcite .",
    "they form a system of equations which relate the expectation values of unitary invariant polynomials labeled by different bubbles . just like the schwinger - dyson equations of matrix models",
    "can be recast as a system of differential constraints forming ( half ) a virasoro algebra , those of tensor models also form an algebra . a set of generators is formed by bubbles with a marked simplex and the commutator is related to the gluing of bubbles forming larger bubbles .",
    "the schwinger - dyson equations of tensor models have been used to solve melonic tensor models in the large @xmath6 limit @xcite , i.e. to calculate the large @xmath6 expectation of polynomials for melonic bubbles in tensor models with melonic potentials . in this case ,",
    "the schwinger - dyson equations simplify drastically and allow to rederive gurau s universality theorem .",
    "also in the case of melonic potentials , the schwinger - dyson equations have been solved to next - to - leading and next - to - next - to - leading orders and in the double - scaling limit @xcite .",
    "a non - melonic example of schinwger - dyson equations , which combine melonic bubbles and other bubbles which are reminiscent of matrix models , has been given in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the equations then reduce at large @xmath6 to those of matrix models with double - trace interactions @xcite .    in spite of this progress , solving the schwinger - dyson equations for tensor models remains extremely challenging .",
    "even for one of the simplest non - trivial models involving melonic bubbles with four simplices , going beyond a few finite orders in the @xmath0 expansion is still out of reach .",
    "however , we know some tensor models can be completely solved at all order in the @xmath0 expansion and in fact satisfy the topological recursion .",
    "this is because those tensor models are matrix models in disguise . from the tensor @xmath13 with four indices ,",
    "one can built a matrix @xmath14 with multi - indices @xmath15 so that @xmath16 and then write a matrix model for @xmath17 . such a tensor model obviously satisfy the topological recursion since its schwinger - dyson equations are loop equations of a matrix model .",
    "although quite trivial , this statement can be seen as a proof of principle that tensor models can be solved using modern matrix model techniques .    instead of facing directly the schwinger - dyson equations of tensor models ,",
    "most of the recent progress in tensor models made use of a correspondence between tensor models and some multi - matrix models with multi - trace interactions .",
    "the correspondence is described through a bijection between the feynman graphs of both sides in @xcite . in the case of quartic interactions ,",
    "it is in fact the hubbard - stratonovich transformation which transforms the tensor model into a matrix model @xcite .",
    "this transformation was used in @xcite to find the double - scaling limit with melonic quartic bubbles .",
    "the correspondence between tensor models and matrix models offers the opportunity to study tensor models indirectly , by using matrix model techniques on the corresponding matrix models .",
    "the matrix models arising in the correspondence are however quite complicated as they involve multiple matrices which do not commute .",
    "nevertheless , the matrix model obtained by the hubbard - stratonovich transformation applied to the quartic melonic tensor model is simpler and can be used to test the use of matrix model techniques in that context .",
    "this program has been initiated in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that all eigenvalues fall into the potential well without spreading at large @xmath6 .",
    "this is in contrast with ordinary matrix models for which the vandermonde determinant causes the eigenvalues to repel each other and prevent them from simultaneously falling in the potential well .",
    "however , in this matrix model , the vandermonde determinant is a sub - leading correction at large @xmath6 .",
    "this result was in fact expected from the direct analysis of the schwinger - dyson equations of the quartic melonic tensor model at large @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it was further shown in @xcite that after substracting the leading value of the eigenvalues and appropriately rescaling the corrections , another matrix model is obtained , involving @xmath5 matrices @xmath18 .",
    "the matrix @xmath19 is called the matrix of color @xmath20 .",
    "although the model couples those matrices all together , it only does so at subleading orders in the @xmath0 expansion . at large @xmath6",
    ", it reduces to a gue for each color independently , with their expected semi - circle eigenvalue distributions .",
    "the matrix model action however contains corrections to the gue at arbitrarily high order in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "it is a natural question to ask whether the @xmath0 expansion of this matrix model satisfies the topological recursion .",
    "if so , it would give another example of a topological recursion for a tensor model , with a different origin than the matrix model with multi - indices mentioned above .    to answer that question , a quick look at the action which will be presented below shows that it is a multi - matrix model with matrices @xmath18 for @xmath21 and multi - trace interactions of the form @xmath22 .",
    "interestingly and fortunately , the topological recursion for matrix models with multi - trace interactions was presented by borot very recently @xcite .",
    "in that situation , it is necessary to supplement the ordinary topological recursion with an infinite set of `` initial conditions '' ( which depend on the model under consideration ) called the blobs .",
    "they give rise to the notion of blobbed topological recursion whose properties have been analyzed in details in @xcite by borot and shadrin .",
    "the blobbed topological recursion splits the correlation functions into two parts , a polar part which is singular along a cut and is evaluated using the ordinary topological recursion , and the blobs which bring in a holomorphic part of the correlation functions .",
    "we thus find that the quartic melonic tensor model , after some transformation to a matrix model , satisfies the blobbed topological recursion .",
    "it is a fairly straightforward application of @xcite and @xcite , with one notable difference : the spectral curve is not connected .",
    "this novelty is a direct consequence of the multi - matrix aspect . indeed , without the multi - trace interactions , the matrices @xmath18 of different colors",
    "would not be coupled .",
    "then , correlation functions for any fixed color would be obtained from the ordinary topological recursion with a one - matrix spectral curve . moreover",
    ", the connected correlators involving different colors would vanish .",
    "however , upon turning on the multi - trace interactions which couple the @xmath5 colors all together , it becomes necessary to package the fixed - color spectral curves into a global spectral curve which is the union of the fixed - color ones .",
    "once the correct spectral curve is found , the blobbed topological recursion can be applied fairly generically for all @xmath23 .",
    "however , we find that there are properties which depend on @xmath5 . in particular , the matrix model admits a topological expansion , i.e. an expansion in powers of @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 a non - negative integer , so @xmath27 for other values of @xmath5 , the @xmath0 expansion is not topological and is actually an expansion in powers of @xmath28 ( some orders of the expansion can vanish : for instance , at @xmath29 , it really is an expansion in @xmath0 ) .",
    "therefore , when expanding the correlation functions , we might distinguish the contribution which comes from the usual topological expansion in powers of @xmath24 and the others .",
    "this is not what we will do .",
    "indeed , the non - topological orders come from the fact that the coupling constants of the model have @xmath28 expansions",
    ". we can thus perform all calculations of the correlation functions as in the topological cases , find them as functions of the coupling constants and eventually expand the latter .",
    "this is however very awkward and since it is obvious that it can be done in principle , we will instead focus on the topological case @xmath30 .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : quartic ]",
    ", we recall the definition of the quartic melonic tensor model and summarize the analysis of @xcite .",
    "it leads to the matrix model which is the one the topological recursion is then applied to . in section [ sec : loopeqs ] , we define the correlation functions .",
    "a key point of our article is that we distinguish the local observables which are labeled by sets of colors from @xmath31 to @xmath5 and global observables obtained by packaging the local ones appropriately and which are defined globally on the spectral curve .",
    "the loop equations are then derived for the local observables . to find the spectral curve , we solve the loop equations in the planar limit for the 1-point and 2-point functions in section [ sec : largen ] . in the same section ,",
    "we further show that non - topological corrections do not have the singularities one expects for topological expansions .",
    "the spectral curve is described explicitly in section [ sec : spectralcurve ] , which then offers the possibility of writing the loop equations on the spectral curve for the global observables .",
    "those loop equations take exactly the same form as in the multi - matrix models of @xcite except for the disconnected spectral curve and the fact that the correlation functions do not have a topological expansion for generic @xmath5 .",
    "we then focus on the six - dimensional case in section [ sec : tr ] .",
    "we derive the linear and quadratic loop equations in sections [ sec : lle ] and [ sec : qle ] , following @xcite which lead to the blobbed",
    "topological recursion in section [ sec : blobbedtr ] .",
    "the most important equations are the split of correlation functions into polar and holomorphic parts , the recursion for the polar part which takes the form of the ordinary topological recursion , and borot s formula @xcite for the holomorphic part .",
    "we then apply the results of @xcite to obtain a graphical expansion of the correlation functions at fixed number of points and genus and a graphical expansion of the blobs which are the completely holomorphic parts of the correlation functions .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : tensorobs ] we propose a way to use the correlation functions of the matrix model in order to evaluate expectation values of tensorial observables in the quartic melonic tensor model .",
    "consider a tensor @xmath32 with entries @xmath33 , i.e. an @xmath5dimensional array of complex numbers where all indices range from @xmath31 to @xmath6 .",
    "we denote its complex conjugate @xmath34 with entries @xmath35 .",
    "tensor models are based on tensorial invariants , i.e. polynomials in the tensor entries which are invariant under the natural action of @xmath36 on @xmath32 and @xmath34 .",
    "the simplest tensorial invariant is the quadratic contraction of @xmath32 with @xmath34 , @xmath37 the quartic melonic polynomial of color @xmath38 , denoted @xmath39 for @xmath20 , is defined by @xmath40 where each sum runs from @xmath31 to @xmath6 . in other words",
    ", one can define the matrix @xmath41 to be the contraction of @xmath32 and @xmath34 on all their indices except those in position @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath42 then , the melonic polynomial of color @xmath38 simply is @xmath43 .",
    "the quartic melonic tensor model has the partition function @xmath44 where the @xmath45 are the coupling constants of the model .",
    "one can perform a hubbard  stratonovich transformation on this integral , @xcite @xmath46 here @xmath47 is a @xmath1 hermitian matrix and the matrix @xmath41 is defined by . introducing the @xmath5 matrices @xmath48 that way , the integral over @xmath32 and @xmath34 becomes gaussian and can thus be performed explicitly .",
    "the result is an integral over the matrices @xmath48 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath49 and rewrite the integral as @xmath50\\ ] ] the matrices @xmath51 can be diagonalized simultaneously , in terms of the eigenvalues of @xmath48 . in @xcite ,",
    "only the symmetric model was investigated where all coupling constants @xmath45 are equal , @xmath52 .",
    "the saddle point analysis at large @xmath6 @xcite then reveals that the eigenvalues all fall into a potential well , without the usual spreading of the eigenvalue density .",
    "this is due to the fact that the vandermonde determinant is here negligible at large @xmath6 .",
    "the eigenvalue density is thus @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the extremum of the potential where all the eigenvalues condensate , @xmath55    that result was indirectly known from the analysis of the tensor model at large @xmath6 in @xcite , where a resolvent was proposed ( in spite of the model not having eigenvalues since it is based on tensors which can not be diagonalized ) and found to be @xmath56 ( it is the resolvent associated with the density @xmath53 ) .    in the non - symmetric case",
    "the conclusion is quite the same as indeed the vandermonde is still negligible at large @xmath6 .",
    "however the eigenvalue density for the matrix @xmath47 of color @xmath38 now depends on the color , @xmath57 in @xcite this result further led the authors to substract to the matrix @xmath47 the amount @xmath58 in order to study the fluctuations .",
    "their idea can be extended to the non - symmetric case and lead to the same type of conclusion .",
    "making the following change of variable , @xmath59 the partition function rewrites @xmath60 where @xmath61 and the partition function @xmath62 is following matrix model partition function @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "as was already the case in the symmetric model , the term of order at least 3 in the matrices @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath65 are subleading at large @xmath6 . to see that",
    ", we assume that the trace of @xmath19 is of order @xmath6 , we then use a power counting argument .",
    "the quadratic term of the action scales like @xmath66 , as in regular matrix models .",
    "looking at the expansion of @xmath67 we find that a typical term @xmath68 of order @xmath69 in scales like @xmath70 the gaussian term thus scales like @xmath66 as expected in matrix models , but all higher order terms for @xmath65 are subleading .",
    "the matrix model is a multi  matrix model with @xmath5 matrices , @xmath5 coupling constants @xmath71 and some specific scalings with @xmath6 and multi - trace interactions which couple the matrices .",
    "it is not more difficult to write the loop equations for a generic @xmath5matrix model with interactions @xmath68 than for our model .",
    "we therefore derive the loop equations for the generic action @xmath72 whose partition function is @xmath73 defined as a _",
    "formal integral_. it is a formal series in @xmath6 and the couplings @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath75 is a function of the @xmath5 matrices , its expectation is defined by @xmath76 the observables of the model are the expectations of products of traces of powers of @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath77 and introduce @xmath78    we will often have lists of @xmath5 elements , one for each color , like the list @xmath79 above .",
    "it is convenient to think of such data as an integer ",
    "valued vector @xmath80 where @xmath81 with a @xmath31 in position @xmath82 .",
    "this provides a natural addition on lists of that type .",
    "we will moreover have lists labeled by such vectors .",
    "a typical example is the list of exponents of the matrices @xmath18 in the above observables .",
    "the list is @xmath83 for the color 1 , and so on .",
    "it has @xmath84 elements of color @xmath38 .",
    "we denote such a list @xmath85 this way , the observable defined above is simply written @xmath86    the _ correlation functions _ are the generating functions of the above defined observables .",
    "they are therefore labeled by @xmath87 .",
    "they are obtained by multiplying @xmath88 with @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , and then summing over all values of @xmath91 .",
    "we say that @xmath92 are the variables of color @xmath38 and there are @xmath84 of them . to emphasize the assignment of the variables to different colors ,",
    "we introduce @xmath5 copies of @xmath93 , respectively denoted for convenience @xmath94 , so that a variable of color @xmath38 belongs to @xmath95 .",
    "the correlation functions are thus functions of the variables @xmath96 .",
    "these variables are packed into a list denoted @xmath97 .",
    "we thus write the correlation functions as @xmath98 note that it is symmetric under the permutations which preserve the colors of the variables , i.e. under the group @xmath99 which acts like @xmath100 on the variable of color @xmath38 , for @xmath101 . as a consequence ,",
    "it turns out that @xmath102 depends on the variables of color @xmath38 as a set and not as a list .",
    "@xmath88 are by definition formal series in @xmath6 and @xmath103 and the couplings @xmath104 .",
    "the correlations functions are also formal series in @xmath105 and @xmath104 . at each order of the @xmath0 expansion , they are holomorphic functions at @xmath106 in their variables .",
    "we use similar notations for the cumulants , or connected correlation functions @xmath107 which satisfy @xmath108 here @xmath109 are @xmath5-dimensional vectors with integral coefficients and we say that @xmath110 is a partition of @xmath87 if @xmath111 and each @xmath112 and we write @xmath113 .    to recover the observables from their generating functions , one can extract the coefficients in front of @xmath114 .",
    "we will often have to extract the coefficient of the generating function in front of only a subset of variables .",
    "assume that @xmath115 , with @xmath116 .",
    "one can then choose a splitting of the list of variables @xmath97 into a list @xmath117 and a list @xmath118 .",
    "for instance , the former consists of the variables , say , @xmath92 for @xmath119 and @xmath20 , while the latter consists of the variables @xmath120 for @xmath119 and @xmath20 .",
    "notice that there is no ordering between the variables of a given color due to the symmetry under color  preserving permutations .",
    "therefore any splitting can be used for each color as long as it has length @xmath121 on one side and @xmath122 on the other side .",
    "assume that we want to extract the coefficient of @xmath123 with respect to @xmath118 at order @xmath124 .",
    "the list of exponents @xmath125 can be stored as a list denoted @xmath126 .",
    "then we will use the shorthand notation @xmath127 ) = \\bigl [ \\prod_{c=1}^d \\prod_{j_c=1}^{k_{rc } } \\bigl(\\tilde{x}^{(c)}_{j_c}\\bigr)^{-a_{j_c}^{(c ) } } \\bigr ] \\overline{w}_{{\\boldsymbol{k}}}(x_{{\\boldsymbol{k}}_l } , x_{{\\boldsymbol{k}}_r } ) = \\left\\langle \\prod_{c=1}^d \\prod_{l_c=1}^{k_{rc } } \\operatorname{tr}m_c^{a^{(c)}_{l_c}-1 } \\prod_{j_c=1}^{k_{lc } } \\operatorname{tr}\\frac1{x^{(c)}_{j_c } - m_c } \\right\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath128f(x ) = f_n$ ] if @xmath129 .    in the matrix models literature ( see for instance @xcite ) , these coefficients are often expressed as integrals around the cut of the planar resolvent . as we will see later , in our model there are several cuts and we can use the same integral representation provided we integrate over the corresponding cuts .",
    "we use both notations depending on the context .    if the potential @xmath130 is the same for all @xmath5 matrices , and if @xmath74 is symmetric , then the correlation functions are invariant under color permutations .",
    "this means that if @xmath131 acts on @xmath132 by permuting its elements as follows @xmath133 , then @xmath134 here we abuse the notation a little bit and denote @xmath135 the list of variables where the sets @xmath136 have been permuted by @xmath137 .",
    "the correlation functions can be described in two ways .    *",
    "the @xmath8-point correlation functions @xmath138 we have just described are functions over @xmath139 , i.e. one copy of @xmath93 for each variable and keeping track of the color assigned to each variable ( in fact , as expected , those functions have cuts , so it should read @xmath95 minus some cut which depends on the color @xmath38 ) .",
    "this will be the preferred choice to derive the loop equations and perform actual calculations .",
    "we call them _ local _ observables , as they require a choice of color assigned to each variable .",
    "+ equivalently , one can package them , at fixed @xmath8 , in a tensor @xmath140 where @xmath141 indicates the color of the @xmath142-th variable , for @xmath143 . either way , the essential point is that each variable is assigned a color .",
    "+ we will write the loop equations in terms of those correlation functions , in equations and , and use them to solve for the 1-point and 2-point functions in section [ sec : largen ] . * as an alternative , and this will be the better choice to understand the structure of the model , we can package all @xmath8-point functions @xmath138 into a single @xmath8-point function @xmath144 by allowing the variables @xmath145 to live on any possible color .",
    "this means that the variable @xmath146 lives on the union of the @xmath5 copies of @xmath93 , or in fact @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the cut on the color @xmath38 , as we will see after solving for the 1-point functions at large @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath149 then the _ global _",
    "@xmath8-point function is defined as @xmath150    these global observables will be the key objects satisfying the topological recursion , see section [ sec : tr ] . before that , we need to find the planar 1-point and 2-point functions using their local versions , which we do in section [ sec : largen ] .",
    "this allows us to identify the spectral curve and show that it is disconnected in section [ sec : spectralcurve ] , leading to a precise definition of the global correlation functions in equation .",
    "then one can write the loop equations directly in terms of the global correlation functions , equation      in regular matrix models , the disc equation is the loop equation obtained for all @xmath151 from @xmath152 in the model we investigate , these equations are replaced by a family of the form @xmath153 moreover the form of the multi - matrix interaction of the action gives rise to unusual terms in the loop equations .",
    "we then provide a detailed derivation of the corresponding set of discs equations . computing the above derivative",
    "explicitly gives @xmath154 for all @xmath155 , and @xmath156 .",
    "we turn those equations into an equation on generating functions by multiplying the equation for @xmath8 on matrix @xmath157 with @xmath158  to emphasize that @xmath159 is the variable for the matrix @xmath157 ,",
    "we further write @xmath160 . we then sum them over @xmath161 .",
    "there are three types of contributions .",
    "the first term gives @xmath162 .",

    "the correlation functions are split into a polar part , determined by the usual formula for the topological recursion , and a holomorphic part . for completeness",

    "our results constitute a proof of principle that tensor models can be solved at all orders in the @xmath0 expansion and feature similar structures as matrix models , in particular the topological recursion .",
    "this opens numerous questions .",
    "a natural question is that of the integrability of our model .",
    "while the ordinary topological recursion is a modern way to study the integrability in matrix models , it is unclear that its extension to the blobbed recursion still features integrability .",
    "this is a question for the blobbed recursion as a whole rather than our specific situation .",
    "we have studied the case @xmath30 which is part of the sequence @xmath977 for which the matrix model has a topological expansion in the sense of an expansion in powers of @xmath24 . for other values of @xmath5 ,",
    "the non - topological corrections come from @xmath28 expansions of the coupling constants .",
    "one solution is thus to perform the blobbed topological recursion just like we did and eventually expand the coupling constants in the correlation functions",
    ". it may be interesting to look for another approach , like finding a recursion for the non - topological corrections to the correlation functions .    finally , an exciting direction is to transfer our results directly into the framework of tensor models .",
    "indeed , the blobbed topological recursion we found applies to a matrix model which is obtained from the quartic melonic tensor model after several transformations .",
    "it thus gives a solution to the loop equations of the so - obtained matrix model .",
    "the tensor model however has its own schwinger - dyson equations , which as explained in the introduction are quite challenging .",
    "we now possess two instances of tensor models for which a topological recursion applies .",
    "one is the case of matrix - like interactions in tensor model , where one defines multi - indices , say @xmath978 , sets @xmath16 and considers as tensor model any matrix model on @xmath979 .",
    "the second instance is the result from the present article .",
    "both instances thus make use of matrix models .",
    "it is important for the development of tensor models to solve their schwinger - dyson equations directly .",
    "a first approach is to try and transfer or translate the expressions found here for the matrix correlators to expressions for the tensorial observables .",
    "solving the schwinger - dyson equations of tensor models directly also would help to compare our results with existing results on the full @xmath0 expansion .",
    "there is indeed a classification due to gurau and schaeffer @xcite of all the feynman graphs of tensor models with respect to gurau s degree .",
    "this classification expresses the free energy and the 2-point function at each order of the @xmath0 expansion as a finite sum over objects called schemes and it gives the corresponding singularities .",
    "the quartic melonic tensor model which was our starting point generates a subset of the graphs studied in @xcite with the same exponents of @xmath6 . in fact , an approach similar to @xcite was used in @xcite suggesting a similar classification .",
    "therefore , a relation between our work and @xcite should exist and it would be particularly interesting to understand it .",

    "<S> it is a new extension of the topological recursion , recently introduced by borot and further studied by borot and shadrin . </S>",
    "<S> here it applies straightforwardly , yet with a novelty as our model displays a disconnected spectral curve , which is the union of several spectral curves of the gaussian unitary ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose a way to evaluate expectations of tensorial observables using the correlation functions computed from the blobbed topological recursion . </S>"
