    "in the last decade , ab - initio nuclear structure calculations have made great progress  @xcite .",
    "light nuclei up to carbon or so can now be described in terms of their nucleonic degrees of freedom , realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) forces ( i.e. , those that fit the available body of nn data with a @xmath4 per datum ) augmented by a three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) .",
    "one of the major advances is due to the systematic construction of nuclear forces within chiral effective field theory ( eft )  @xcite . within this approach ,",
    "the unknown short - range part of the nuclear force is systematically encoded in terms of low - energy constants and contact terms , while the long - range part of the interaction stems from pion exchange .",
    "one of the hallmarks of this approach is the `` power counting '' , i.e. , an expansion of the nuclear lagrangian in terms of the momentum ratio @xmath5 . here",
    ", @xmath6 denotes the typical momentum scale at which the nucleus is probed , while @xmath7 denotes the high - momentum cutoff scale that limits the applicability of the effective field theory . within this approach , three - nucleon forces appear naturally at next - to - next - to - leading ( n@xmath8lo ) order @xmath9 , and four - nucleon forces get introduced at n@xmath10lo , that is at order @xmath11 in terms of the momentum scale and the cutoff @xmath7 .",
    "the chiral interactions have been tested in very light systems of mass @xmath12=@xmath13 through precise few - body calculations @xcite , and in @xmath14-shell nuclei within no - core shell model ( ncsm ) calculations  @xcite . in these calculations ,",
    "the nn interaction was taken up to n@xmath10lo , while the three - nucleon interaction was taken at its leading order @xmath9 ( n@xmath8lo ) . within the ncsm calculations , the `` bare '' chiral interaction needs to be renormalized , due to the size of the model space .",
    "lattice calculations provide a different approach for the implementation and solution of chiral interactions in the nuclear many - body problem  @xcite . presently , such calculations employ two- and three - nucleon forces at order n@xmath8lo , and they target @xmath14-shell nuclei .",
    "the coupled - cluster method is an alternative approach that is particularly suited to study the saturation properties of chiral nucleon - nucleon interactions in medium - mass nuclei such as @xmath2ca and @xmath15ni  @xcite , or even heavier nuclei . using a gamow basis expansion  @xcite",
    ", this method can also include continuum effects and describe rare isotopes that are in the vicinity of nuclei with closed ( sub)shells  @xcite .",
    "the `` bare '' chiral interaction models are still relatively `` hard '' interactions , that is the interaction has nonzero matrix elements even for high momentum transfers @xmath16 , where @xmath17 @xmath18 denotes the fermi momentum at nuclear saturation . using for example matrix elements of the chiral interaction by machleidt and entem  @xcite ,",
    "we extend typically the momentum integrations up to 8  @xmath18 . for a model space consisting of oscillator wave functions ,",
    "a simple estimate shows that the number of oscillator shells required for the solution of a nucleus with radius @xmath19 and an interaction with momentum cutoff @xmath20 is about @xmath21 ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : medmass ] below for details ) . recall that the number of single - particle states ( single - particle @xmath22-shells ) grows as @xmath23 in the @xmath24-scheme ( and as @xmath25 in a @xmath22-coupled spherical scheme ) .",
    "it is therefore clear that high - momentum interactions require large model spaces .",
    "this makes wave - function - based solutions of the nuclear many - body problem a challenging task . within the coupled - cluster approach",
    ", one can overcome this difficulty through a spherically symmetric reformulation of the method .",
    "this approach enables us to consider much increased model spaces , including even up to 20 oscillator shells .",
    "the obvious alternative consists of lowering the momentum cutoff .",
    "the momentum cutoff of the interactions can be decreased by a similarity renormalization group ( srg ) transformation of the nn interaction  @xcite , or by integrating out high - momentum modes within a renormalization group transformation or a similarity transformation  @xcite .",
    "such transformations preserve all properties ( such as phase shifts and bound states ) of the nn interactions up to the cutoff .",
    "the srg transformations yield interactions that are band diagonal in momentum space , and the band width is characterized by a momentum scale .",
    "eigenstates of these interactions are localized in momentum space , and the low - momentum states are thus decoupled from the high - momentum physics .",
    "the low - momentum interactions @xmath26 are characterized by a momentum cutoff beyond which all interaction matrix elements quickly approach zero .",
    "we denote the momentum scale of the srg interactions and the cutoff of the @xmath26 interactions by @xmath20 . starting with @xmath27",
    ", one can thus generate a one - parameter family of interactions from the chiral nn interaction models by performing srg transformations , or by integrating out high - momentum modes .",
    "we will use this approach in order to study the scale- or cutoff dependence of the nuclear binding energy , and to examine aspects of the power counting . throughout this work",
    "we make the underlying assumption that a complete description within chiral effective field theory would yield an accurate description of atomic nuclei .",
    "thus , we attribute any scale dependence directly to the neglected three - nucleon forces and other neglected high - order terms of the interaction .",
    "the more traditional way of dealing with `` hard '' interactions consists of the computation of the so - called @xmath3-matrix  @xcite , which is based on a green s function approach @xcite using normally unperturbed propagators .",
    "the @xmath3-matrix depends thus on the starting energy that is employed in its construction .",
    "analytical arguments demand that this dependence weakens as increasingly larger model spaces are considered , and it vanishes for infinite spaces . within the spherical coupled - cluster approach ,",
    "we are able to investigate the convergence properties of the @xmath3-matrix that is constructed from chiral interaction models .",
    "another approach to renormalize `` hard '' interactions is the unitary correlator method ( ucom ) . here",
    "a unitary transformation is constructed to remove the hard core and short - range contributions of the tensor force by an appropriately formulated correlation operator  @xcite .",
    "this method has seen several applications , but its convergence and saturation properties have not yet been studied in a framework that includes substantial wave function correlations .",
    "we fill this gap in this work .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to employ `` bare '' and renormalized nucleon - nucleon interactions ( employing srg and low - momentum techniques , the @xmath3-matrix and the ucom method ) , to compare and analyze their convergence and saturation properties and their impact on nuclear structure .",
    "in addition to this task , this paper also contains significant supplemental information that could not be presented in several recent short communications  @xcite . in particular , we present a detailed study and practical solution of the center - of - mass problem , and study the evolution of single - particle energies in neutron - rich oxygen and fluorine isotopes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] , we introduce spherical coupled - cluster theory . we address and resolve questions regarding the center - of - mass problem in section  [ sec : com ] . in section  [ sec : medmass ] , we compute the binding energies of the nuclei @xmath0he , @xmath1o , @xmath28ca , and @xmath15ca starting from `` bare '' chiral nn interactions .",
    "section  [ sec : evolve ] is dedicated to the evolution of single particle energies in neutron - rich oxygen isotopes . in section  [ sec : srg ] , we study @xmath28ca for several momentum scales @xmath20 of the srg interaction , and examine the power counting .",
    "section  [ sec : g ] focuses on the starting - energy dependence and the convergence properties of the @xmath3-matrix for @xmath29he and @xmath1o .",
    "we analyze the convergence properties of the ucom interaction in section  [ sec : ucom ] .",
    "we finish with our summary .",
    "some technical details of the spherical coupled - cluster method are relegated to the appendix .",
    "in this section we give an outline of the coupled - cluster method @xcite and introduce an angular momentum coupled formulation of the coupled - cluster equations .",
    "first we outline coupled - cluster theory for the computation of ground state energy of closed - shell nuclei within the so - called ccsd and @xmath30-ccsd(t ) approaches .",
    "thereafter , we introduce the equation - of - motion theory for the calculation of ground and excited states in closed- and open - shell nuclei . we introduce also the spherical formulation of coupled - cluster theory .",
    "finally , we discuss how to calculate expectation values of observables in coupled - cluster theory .",
    "coupled - cluster theory is based on the similarity transformation @xmath31 of the normal - ordered hamiltonian @xmath32 . here ,",
    "the hamiltonian is normal - ordered with respect to a product state @xmath33 which serves as a reference .",
    "likewise , the particle - hole cluster operator @xmath34 is defined with respect to the reference state .",
    "the @xmath35-particle @xmath35-hole ( @xmath35p-@xmath35h ) cluster operator is @xmath36 here and in the following , the indices @xmath37 label occupied single - particle orbitals while @xmath38 label unoccupied orbitals .",
    "the most commonly used approximation is coupled - cluster with singles - and - doubles excitations ( ccsd ) where @xmath39 .",
    "the unknown amplitudes @xmath40 and @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) are determined from the solution of the coupled - cluster equations @xmath42 here @xmath43 is a 1p-1h excitation of the reference state , and @xmath44 is a similarly defined 2p-2h excited state .",
    "the ccsd equations  ( [ ccsd ] ) thus demand that the reference state @xmath33 has no 1p-1h and no 2p-2h excitations , i.e. , it is an eigenstate of the similarity - transformed hamiltonian  ( [ hbar ] ) in the space of all 1p-1h and 2p-2h excited states .",
    "once the ccsd equations are solved , the ground - state energy is computed as @xmath45 coupled - cluster theory has the following virtues .",
    "first , the similarity - transformed hamiltonian can be evaluated exactly since the hausdorff - baker - campbell expansion & = & h + [ h , t ] + 12 !",
    "+ & & + 13!+  + & = & ( h e^t)_c terminates exactly at fourfold - nested commutators for two - body hamiltonians . here ,",
    "the last term in parentheses , @xmath46 , indicates that only those terms enter where a cluster operator @xmath47 is connected to the hamiltonian @xmath32 to the right .",
    "since every cluster operator is linked to the hamiltonian , coupled - cluster theory by construction fulfills goldstone s linked cluster theorem and yields size - extensive results .",
    "this is particularly important in applications to medium - mass nuclei .",
    "second , within the ccsd approximation , the computational effort scales as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the number of occupied and unoccupied orbitals in the reference state @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "thus , the computational effort is much smaller than within the configuration interaction approach ( or shell - model in nuclear physics ) which exhibits a factorial scaling as function of the chosen single - particle space and number of nucleons .",
    "coupled - cluster theory with inclusion of full triples ( ccsdt )  @xcite is usually considered to be too computationally expensive in most many - body systems of considerable size .",
    "therefore triples corrections are usually taken into account perturbatively using the non - iterative ccsd(t ) approach described in ref .",
    "recently , a more sophisticated way of including the full triples known as the @xmath30-ccsd(t ) approach , has been developed by taube _",
    "_ @xcite . in the @xmath30-ccsd(t ) approach the left - eigenvector solution of the ccsd similarity - transformed hamiltonian is utilized in the calculation of a non - iterative triples correction to the coupled - cluster ground state energy .",
    "the left eigenvalue problem is given by [ left ] | = e|  , were @xmath51 denotes the de - excitation cluster operator = 1 + _ 1 + _ 2  , with _ 1 & = & _ i , a ^i_a a_a a^_i  , + _ 2 & = & _ i , j , a , b ^ij_ab a_b a_a a^_i a^_j  . the unknowns , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , result from the ground - state solution of the left eigenvalue problem ( [ left ] ) .",
    "they are utilized together with the cluster amplitudes , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , to compute the energy correction due to triples clusters as e_3&= & 1(3!)^2 _ i j k a b c | ( f_hp + v)_n|^abc_ijk + & & 1_ijk^abc_ijk^abc|(v_nt_2)_c|  .    here , @xmath54 denotes the part of the normal - ordered one - body hamiltonian that annihilates particles and creates holes , while _",
    "ijk^abc f_ii+f_jj+f_kk - f_aa - f_bb - f_cc is expressed in terms of the diagonal matrix elements of the normal - ordered one - body hamiltonian @xmath55 . in the case of hartree - fock orbitals ,",
    "the one - body part of the hamiltonian is diagonal and @xmath54 vanishes .",
    "the subscript @xmath56 denotes the connected part of the operator , and @xmath57 is a 3p-3h excitation of the reference state .",
    "the ccsd and the @xmath30-ccsd(t ) approaches are known as single - reference coupled - cluster methods ( sr - ccm ) , and therefore they are particularly well suited for nuclei with an expected closed ( sub- ) shell structure . by adding or removing particles to a closed - shell nucleus , we move into regions of nuclei with open - shell structure , and clearly the sr - ccm methods are not well suited for the description of these nuclei .",
    "most nuclei are of open - shell character and in order to study and predict properties like the evolution of shell - structure as we move towards the drip line in various isotopic chains , we clearly need to go beyond the sr - ccm class of approaches .",
    "there exists a variety of coupled - cluster methods that have been specifically designed to address the structure of open - shell systems , see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview of some of these methods .",
    "most methods are either based on a multi - reference formulation of the coupled - cluster method ( mr - ccm ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of various sr - ccm and mr - ccm ) , or an extension of equation - of - motion ( eom ) theory @xcite based on the coupled - cluster method ( eom - ccm ) ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the beauty of the eom - ccm is that it has the simplicity and transparency of sr - ccm such as the ccsd and the @xmath30-ccsd(t ) approaches discussed above , and that the method allows for systematic improvements and extensions .    in order to extend our _ ab initio _ coupled - cluster program beyond closed ( sub- ) shell nuclei",
    ", we use the eom - ccm approach .",
    "we give a brief outline of the method in the following .",
    "the basic idea behind eom @xcite is to calculate states @xmath58 of the nucleus @xmath59 by acting with an excitation operator @xmath60 on the ground state @xmath61 of a closed - shell reference nucleus @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath60 is a particle number - conserving operator ( @xmath62 ) , @xmath60 will generate excited states of the nucleus @xmath12 . in the case of @xmath60 not conserving the number of particles ( @xmath63 ) , @xmath60 can generate ground and excited states of the open - shell nucleus @xmath59 with respect to the reference nucleus @xmath12 . in eom - cc theory ,",
    "the ground state of the closed - shell reference nucleus @xmath12 is given by the coupled - cluster wave function , @xmath64 . in case",
    "we wish to calculate excited states of the closed - shell nucleus @xmath12 ( @xmath62 ) , we define the excitation operator @xmath65 , @xmath66 and by truncating at the two - particle - two - hole excitation level , we get the standard eom - ccsd approach . in case",
    "we wish to calculate ground and excited states of a nucleus with a nucleon added or removed from a closed - shell nucleus ( @xmath67 ) , we define the excitation operators @xmath68 with , @xmath69 and truncating at the two - particle - one - hole and two - hole - one - particle levels , we get the the particle - attached and particle - removed equation - of - motion coupled - cluster methods ( pa / pr - eom - ccm ) , see , for example , refs .",

    "similarly , pr - eom - ccm removes a particle from @xmath12 by creating @xmath72 , @xmath70-@xmath75 , @xmath71-@xmath76 , excitations on the ground state of @xmath12 . by multiplying the equation for the nucleus @xmath12 , @xmath77 , from the left with @xmath60 , and subtracting it from the equation for the nucleus @xmath59 , @xmath78",

    "wave function methods need to employ very large model spaces in order to yield converged results . for spherical reference states ( nuclei with closed major shells or closed subshells ) ,",
    "it is therefore better to employ the spherical symmetry to further reduce the number of unknowns , that is , the number of cluster amplitudes .",
    "for such nuclei , the cluster operator of eq .",

    "we have derived and numerically implemented the spherical scheme within the ccsd approximation .",
    "we tested that our @xmath24-scheme code and the spherical code give identical results for several test cases .",
    "the spherical code permits us to reach much larger model spaces , and we are able to achieve satisfactory convergence even for `` hard '' interactions such as the `` bare '' n@xmath10lo interaction . in ref .",
    "@xcite we used the spherical coupled - cluster code to calculate the ground states of medium - mass nuclei like @xmath2ca and @xmath15ni within the ccsd approximation and starting from bare chiral interactions . in a model space of 15 major oscillator shells ,",
    "the results were reasonably well converged .",
    "recently , we have also implemented the @xmath30-ccsd(t ) approach in an angular - momentum - coupled scheme . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculated the ground states of the oxygen isotopes using chiral interactions in model spaces comprising up to 20 major oscillator shells within the @xmath30-ccsd(t ) approach .",
    "in such large spaces we were even able to converge the ground state energies for a chiral interaction with a 600  mev@xmath97 momentum cutoff . likewise , the inclusion of continuum scattering states ",
    "necessary for a description of halo states in weakly bound nuclei ",
    "yields large model spaces that can be treated within he spherical scheme  @xcite .",
    "details of the angular - momentum - coupled @xmath30-ccsd(t ) approach are given in the appendix .",
    "for expectation values and the computation of ground state properties other than the energy , we utilize the right and left eigenvectors of the similarity - transformed hamiltonian @xmath98 and compute the one- and two - body reduced density matrices , @xmath99 expectation values can then be computed by expressing the operator of interest in terms of the density matrices .",
    "the hellmann - feynman theorem is another route to the computation of expectation values . in this case , we consider a response of the ground - state energy to a perturbation caused by a given operator of interest .",
    "the hellmann - feynman theorem expresses the expectation values of an observable @xmath59 as @xmath100 here @xmath101 is the ground - state energy of the hamiltonian @xmath102 .",
    "unfortunately , the relation  ( [ expect ] ) does not hold exactly within the coupled - cluster approach since this method is not variational when the cluster operator is truncated .",
    "we will nevertheless base the computation of expectation values on eq .",
    "( [ expect ] ) .",
    "experience shows that this approach is approximately valid if the relevant particle - hole excitations are incorporated . in practice ,",
    "the differential quotient  ( [ expect ] ) is numerically implemented as a difference quotient with @xmath103 .",
    "this requires us to perform two calculations ( one for zero and one for small nonzero @xmath104 ) . for relatively `` hard '' interactions such as the `` bare '' n@xmath10lo ,",
    "we also perform two hartree - fock calculations and thus employ slightly different single - particle bases in these two cases . while such a procedure is unnecessary for methods that fulfill the hellmann - feynman theorem , it is important within our approach .",
    "we note that this approach most closely reflects the physical situation of an expectation value measuring the system s response to a perturbation",
    "in this section , we demonstrate that the coupled - cluster wave function factorizes to a very good approximation into a product of a center - of - mass wave function and an intrinsic wave function",
    ". we will present a simple procedure that checks this factorization and give an estimate for the degree of the achieved factorization .",
    "this section significantly expands on the short demonstration of the factorization in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us consider the nuclear @xmath12-body hamiltonian @xmath105 here , @xmath106 is a two - body operator that is invariant under rotations and translations .",
    "thus , the total momentum and angular momentum are conserved quantities .",
    "it is advantageous to separate the hamiltonian into an intrinsic hamiltonian @xmath107 and the center - of - mass hamiltonian ( i.e. , the kinetic energy @xmath108 of the center of mass ) as & = & t_cm + h_in + & = & t_cm + _ j < k^a ( ( _ j-_k)^22ma + v(j , k ) )  .",
    "note that the intrinsic hamiltonian @xmath107 does not depend on the center - of - mass coordinate .",
    "thus , we could add an arbitrary operator @xmath109 of the center - of - mass coordinate to the intrinsic hamiltonian @xmath107 without changing the intrinsic properties of the resulting hamiltonian .",
    "in other words , the eigenfunctions @xmath110 of the @xmath12-body hamiltonian @xmath111 are products of an intrinsic eigenfunction @xmath112 of the intrinsic hamiltonian @xmath107 , and a center - of - mass wave function @xmath113 that is the eigenfunction of the center - of - mass hamiltonian @xmath109 , that is , @xmath114 the corresponding energy is the sum @xmath115 of the center - of - mass energy and the intrinsic energy .",
    "the question thus arises which operator @xmath109 to choose .",
    "let us consider the ncsm  @xcite as an example . here",
    ", one works in a complete @xmath116 space consisting of a basis of all @xmath12-particle slater determinants of oscillator states with frequency @xmath117 and total excitation energy not exceeding @xmath116 .",
    "one can add the center - of - mass hamiltonian @xmath118 with @xmath119 to the intrinsic hamiltonian @xmath107 , and obtains a factorized ground - state wave function where the center - of - mass wave function @xmath113 is a gaussian with frequency @xmath117 .",
    "the ( truncated ) coupled - cluster method is unable to employ an @xmath116 space , and it is arguably the best idea to completely remove any reference to the center - of - mass coordinate .",
    "thus , we solve an intrinsic hamiltonian @xmath107 that depends on @xmath120 independent coordinates in a hilbert space spanned by wave functions of @xmath12 coordinates .",
    "two comments are in order .",
    "first , the truncated coupled - cluster method is not an exact solution of the @xmath12-body problem , but rather a very efficient approximation .",
    "thus , it is not guaranteed _ a priori _ that the coupled - cluster wave function exhibits the factorization  ( [ factor ] ) .",
    "recall that any @xmath12-body wave function can be expanded as @xmath121 where @xmath122 from normalization , and we assume that the non - negative weights @xmath123 are ordered in decreasing order . only if all but one of the weights @xmath123 vanishes , does the factorization  ( [ factor ] ) take place ; otherwise , the factorization might be mildly or strongly violated , depending on the size of the weights @xmath123 .",
    "second , if a factorization of the coupled - cluster wave function takes ( approximately ) place , the form of the center - of - mass wave function @xmath124 corresponding to the largest weight @xmath125 has to be determined .",
    "in what follows we will see that the @xmath12-body coupled - cluster wave function factorizes to a good approximation ( i.e. , @xmath126 ) , and that the center - of - mass wave function is the gaussian ground state of the center - of - mass hamiltonian ( [ hosc ] ) for a yet - to - be determined frequency @xmath127 .",
    "we consider the nucleus @xmath1o and employ the low - momentum interaction @xmath26 with a smooth momentum cutoff @xmath128  @xmath18 derived from machleidt s and entem s chiral n@xmath10lo interaction .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the ground - state energy as a function of the oscillator spacing @xmath129 of the underlying oscillator basis in a model space of nine oscillator shells .",
    "these results are obtained from a ccsd calculation within a spherical hartree - fock basis .",
    "the energy is well converged as it depends very weakly on the model - space parameters .",
    "we also computed the ground - state expectation value @xmath130 of the center - of - mass hamiltonian  ( [ hosc ] ) for a frequency @xmath131 and show the result in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "this expectation value is generally not zero .",
    "this indicates that the coupled - cluster wave function is in general not an eigenstate of the center - of - mass hamiltonian @xmath132",
    ". however , there seems to be little correlation between the ground - state energy and the expectation value @xmath133 , and the latter vanishes approximately in a model space with @xmath134  mev .",
    "thus , at this frequency , the coupled - cluster wave function is approximately the ground state of the center - of - mass hamiltonian @xmath132 . as a check , we fix @xmath135  mev ,",
    "consider the hamiltonian @xmath136 , and compute its ground - state energy as a function of the parameter @xmath104 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . clearly , the ground - state energy is rather insensitive to @xmath104 and varies by only 15  kev as @xmath104 is increased from zero to one .",
    "o using a low - momentum interaction with the center - of - mass hamiltonian @xmath137 added .",
    "calculations employ nine major oscillator shells and @xmath138  mev . as @xmath104 is varied between 0 and 1 , the ground state energy changes by about @xmath139  kev.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the factorization of eq .",

    "this expectation is compatible with our ccsd results for the ground - state energies of @xmath0he ( about @xmath230  mev ) and @xmath1o ( about @xmath231  mev ) using the `` bare '' chiral nn interaction ( see , e.g. , figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and  [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : fig13 ] and  [ fig : fig14 ] show that the ground - state energy of the @xmath3-matrix converges from below as the model space is inceased in size , and that the result of the `` bare '' interaction is approached in very large model spaces .    in conclusion ,",
    "we observe slow convergence for the ccsd ground - state energy with increasing model space with the @xmath3-matrix defined from the `` bare '' n@xmath10lo interaction .",
    "the dependence on the starting energy disappears in sufficiently large model spaces , and the coupled - cluster results with the @xmath3-matrix converge towards coupled - cluster results for the free nucleon - nucleon interaction . in the case of the n@xmath10lo interaction , it is clearly better to start from the free interaction .",
    "it remains to be seen in the case of harder interactions , like the argonne v18 interaction , whether convergence is better using the in - medium @xmath3-matrix as a starting point for _ ab - initio _ coupled - cluster calculations .",
    "let us briefly contrast the @xmath3 matrix to low - momentum nn interactions  la @xmath26 or from the similarity renormalization group .",
    "the latter two preserve phase shifts from nn scattering and bound - state properties up to the chosen momentum cutoff .",
    "they soften the nn interaction and  when not augmented by the induced 3nf  tend to considerably overbind heavier nuclei at lower cutoffs around @xmath232  @xmath18 or so . in a finite model space , the @xmath3-matrix always exhibits a dependence on the starting energy , it converges slowly to the `` bare '' interaction , and it somewhat overbinds the nuclear many - body system compared to the `` bare '' interactions that is used in its construction .",
    "the authors speculate that this last point might seem attractive with a view on practical applications , as `` bare '' nucleon - nucleon interaction models such as the argonne interaction , the cd - bonn interaction and the chiral interaction  @xcite somewhat underbind nuclei .",
    "in other words , the slight overbinding of the @xmath3-matrix often results into very reasonable energies for heavier nuclei , and the @xmath3-matrix simply works very well in practical applications .",
    "let us also consider the saturation and convergence properties of the v@xmath233 nucleon - nucleon interaction  @xcite .",
    "the interaction v@xmath233 is obtained from a unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) that softens the short - range repulsion of the initial `` bare '' interaction by a similarity transformation with a unitary operator , which is explicitly designed to remove the hard - core and the short - ranged tensor components of phenomenological nn interaction . in this section",
    "we consider the ucom interaction obtained from the `` bare '' argonne v18 interaction .",
    "the v@xmath233 interaction was initially applied in mean - field methods .",
    "these applications were very successful .",
    "very reasonable binding energies and saturation properties could already be obtained within the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "only later did this interaction see applications that included the inclusion of many - body correlations within the rpa , many - body perturbation theory  @xcite , the coupled - cluster method  @xcite , and within the no - core shell model  @xcite .",
    "( for a recent review , we refer the reader to ref .  @xcite . )",
    "those later applications suggest that the v@xmath233 interaction is soft yet with appealing saturation properties , and without the need for sizeable 3nfs .",
    "this situation seems surprising . on the one hand ,",
    "the v@xmath233 interaction is similar in its technical construction to the srg interactions  @xcite . on the other hand , the v@xmath233 interaction seems to differ significantly in its saturation property from the srg nucleon - nucleon interactions which tend to overbind nuclei at low momentum cutoffs .",
    "we address this puzzle in what follows , and perform structure calculations with the ucom interaction in large model spaces and for various oscillator frequencies .",
    "we employ the v@xmath233 interaction and compute the ground states of @xmath1o and @xmath28ca within the ccsd approximation .",
    "our calculations employ very large model spaces and a considerable range of oscillator frequencies , and thereby differ from the previous studies  @xcite ; see also ref .",
    "figures  [ fig : fig15 ] and [ fig : fig16 ] show the ground - state energy of @xmath1o and @xmath28ca , respectively , as a function of the employed oscillator frequency @xmath117 for different sizes of the model space ( @xmath207 denotes the number of oscillator shells . ) .",
    "the convergence with respect to increasing size of the model space is slow , and we are unable to achieve convergence in up to 14 major oscillator shells .",
    "the results obtained in the largest model spaces also show that the v@xmath233 interaction considerably overbinds @xmath28ca . within the ccsd approximation",
    ", we find a ground - state energy of about @xmath234  mev for @xmath1o and of about @xmath235 mev for @xmath28ca .",
    "the inclusion of triples corrections within the @xmath30-ccsd(t ) approximation yields a ground - state energy of @xmath236  mev for @xmath1o in 13 oscillator shells and an oscillator frequency @xmath237  mev .",
    "we checked our results as follows .",
    "first , our ccsd results agree with those reported for @xmath0he in ref .",
    "@xcite within about 50  kev in model spaces of up to eight oscillator shells .",
    "second , we also computed the ground - state energy of @xmath28ca in third order many - body perturbation theory .",
    "the relevant diagrams which are included can be found in ref .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbpt ] as function of the oscillator energy @xmath129 and the number of shells @xmath190 .",
    "the results from many body perturbation theory confirm the trend seen in the coupled - cluster calculations , i.e. , they exhibit a rather slow convergence in terms of the number of shells @xmath190 and overbind the nucleus @xmath28ca .",
    "reference  @xcite also solved the ucom potential within many - body perturbation theory , albeit for oscillator frequencies below @xmath134  mev or so . in this regime , the binding energy is closer to the experimental value as the small oscillator frequency acts as a cutoff in momentum space .",
    "we speculate that the v@xmath233 interaction still exhibits relatively long tails in momentum space , which prevent a decoupling of low- and high - momentum modes , or that peculiarities of the corresponding cutoff yield a slow convergence of the ucom interaction in an oscillator basis .",
    "this speculation is borne out by two observations .",
    "first , the comparison of the ucom interaction with the srg interaction in fig .  8 of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the ucom interaction does not decouple well in an oscillator basis .",
    "second , the energy minima in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig15 ] , [ fig : fig16 ] and [ fig : mbpt ] shift to higher frequencies @xmath129 as the size of the model space is increased , as one would expect based on the estimate  ( [ hbaromega ] ) for an interaction with a large momentum cutoff .",
    "our results also suggest that  similar to other srg interactions and low - momentum interactions  the ucom interaction has to be augmented by sizeable many - body forces  @xcite .",
    "the need for these forces is not seen if one restricts the calculations to fixed model spaces where model space parameters such as the oscillator frequency and the number of shells introduce additional momentum cutoffs .",
    "we presented a spherical formulation of the coupled - cluster method for the computation of energy spectra in nuclei with closed subshells and their neighbors .",
    "this method has been used to solve nuclear structure problems in model spaces consisting of up to 20 oscillator shells , which allows us to obtain well - converged results for nucleon - nucleon interactions derived from chiral effective field theory .",
    "we find that chiral nn interactions saturate nuclei such as @xmath1o and @xmath15ca within 0.5  mev per nucleon compared to data .",
    "the two - particle  two - hole clusters provide about 90% of correlation energy , with the approximation of triples clusters accounting for the remaining 10% .",
    "we investigated the shell evolution in neutron - rich isotopes of oxygen and fluorine and found that nucleon - nucleon interactions alone fail to describe the experimentally observed ( sub)shell structure .",
    "we also employed similarity renormalization group transformations of a `` bare '' chiral interaction . at the considered resolution scale , we obtained overbinding of up to several mev per nucleon .",
    "again , the missing contributions ( when compared to experiment ) are of natural size in the power counting of effective field theory .",
    "these results suggest that the systematic approach to nuclear structure can ( in principle ) be extended to medium - mass nuclei .",
    "we studied the @xmath3-matrix approach and found a very weak starting - energy dependence in large model spaces combined with a rather slow convergence with respect to increases in the size of the model space . for the ucom interaction ,",
    "we find a slow convergence with respect to the size of the model space and an overbinding for @xmath28ca that is comparable to other low - momentum interactions .",
    "we presented an in - depth study of the center - of - mass problem , and demonstrated that the wave functions of the intrinsic hamiltonian factorize to a very good approximation into an intrinsic wave function and a gaussian for the center of mass . while an analytical understanding of this behavior is still lacking , our calculations for ground and excited states and for a virtually exactly solvable toy model indicate that calculations in sufficiently large model spaces  when based on the intrinsic hamiltonian ",
    "do not suffer from a center - of - mass problem .",
    "in this section we present expressions for several diagrams involved in our computation of the ccsd or @xmath30-ccsd(t ) equations that involve various one - body , two - body , and three - body amplitudes and operators .",
    "we employ the following shorthands for the @xmath238 and @xmath239 amplitudes , namely @xmath240 and @xmath41 , respectively . to the latter we add the total two - particle angular momentum @xmath241 in order to indicate a two - body wave operator with hole states @xmath242",
