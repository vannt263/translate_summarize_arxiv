    "high redshift type ia supernovae provide an excellent means of studying the expansion history of the universe  @xcite .",
    "it is estimated that the intrinsic dispersion in supernova luminosities can be calibrated to @xmath1 mag , and perhaps in the future to @xmath2 mag  @xcite , making them excellent standard candles .",
    "for supernovae at redshifts @xmath3 , this intrinsic dispersion sets the limiting accuracy with which supernovae may be used to measure distances . for higher redshifts ( @xmath4 ) , however , gravitational lensing by random fluctuations in the intervening matter distribution induces a dispersion in supernova brightness comparable to the intrinsic dispersion @xcite , degrading their value as standard candles .",
    "these magnification fluctuations have zero mean , and so may be averaged away with sufficient numbers of supernovae @xcite .",
    "however , the additional dispersion means that more supernovae are required than for low redshift samples to achieve a given signal to noise .",
    "it would be of great utility to determine the gravitational lensing magnification of each individual supernova .",
    "this would allow a correction of the observed brightnesses of the supernovae , and therefore improve their use as standard candles .",
    "such a correction would be equivalent to obtaining a larger sample of supernovae , for free .",
    "in addition , measuring the gravitational lensing distribution at high redshift can be an important probe of the dark matter  @xcite .",
    "one means of achieving this would be an inspection of the foreground galaxies for each supernova .",
    "for example , sn1997ff at @xmath5 has several foreground galaxies in its vicinity , leading to a magnification possibly as large as 0.4 magnitudes  @xcite .",
    "if the magnification factor could be accurately estimated from the foreground galaxy images , then the supernova brightness could be corrected to its unlensed value .",
    "the correction factor depends strongly on uncertain properties of the galaxies mass distributions ( illustrated by the controversy over the extent of lensing of sn1997ff ) , and would miss possibly important contributions from dark halos .",
    "furthermore , since such corrections would primarily shift highly magnified sne to lower brightnesses , while leaving demagnified sne unaffected , it would bias the resultant hubble diagram .",
    "it is apparent that direct identification of individual lenses does not robustly determine the lensing magnification .",
    "it is also possible to correlate , in a statistical manner , the foreground galaxy number density close to the lines of sight to supernovae with the lensing effects on these supernovae  @xcite , but these statistical results do not help us `` correct '' any given individual supernova .    an alternative method for correcting lensing magnification is to utilize weak lensing maps constructed from shear measurements of background galaxies .",
    "the same matter fluctuations responsible for the magnification of supernovae also lead to shearing of galaxy images .",
    "high redshift sne are discovered by repeated exposures of wide fields , which when co - added provide extremely deep images of the galaxies surrounding the supernovae . such deep , wide field images are well - suited for measurement of weak lensing shear .",
    "it is thus natural to hope that mass reconstruction from shear measurements of the surrounding fields might allow for the correction of weak lensing magnification , restoring the supernovae to their intrinsic brightnesses .",
    "a perfect measurement of the shear field at the redshift of a given supernova would allow for a perfect reconstruction of the projected mass surface density ( modulo the mass - sheet degeneracy , which should be unimportant for large enough fields ) . from this mass surface density it is possible to calculate the lensing magnification , and therefore perfectly account for ( and correct ) the lensing effects on the observed brightness .",
    "perfect shear maps are unavailable , however , and therefore our ability to infer the magnification is compromised . in this paper , we investigate how well weak lensing reconstruction can correct the brightnesses of distant supernovae .",
    "the basic scheme is as follows .",
    "a supernova occurs in a given field , and its peak apparent magnitude is observed and calibrated , using some variant of the @xcite relation .",
    "then the ( co - added ) field containing the supernova is used to estimate the local shear at the supernova s location by averaging over a smoothing angle @xmath6 .",
    "the shear map is then converted to an effective convergence map using some reconstruction algorithm such as that of @xcite , and the derived convergence is used to correct the supernova s standard candle brightness . in the following section we estimate the variance in convergence for point sources given knowledge of the smoothed shear map , @xmath7 , which is a direct measure of the improvement such an approach can offer .",
    "we find that useful corrections require very large background source galaxy densities , and that this method is therefore of only marginal utility .",
    "let us denote by @xmath8 the effective convergence , relative to the homogeneous filled - beam value , for a point source .",
    "in figure  [ angpow ] we plot the angular power spectrum of the convergence , @xmath9  @xcite , for sources at @xmath10 . to calculate this , we employ the fitting functions of  @xcite for the linear matter power spectrum , and follow the prescription of  @xcite for the non - linear correction .",
    "we use a cobe normalized , scale invariant ( @xmath11 ) linear power spectrum in a flat @xmath12cdm cosmology with total matter density @xmath13 , hubble constant @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , and baryon density @xmath16 .",
    "we also assume that the dark matter is microscopic ( e.g. , elementary particles ) , rather than macroscopic ( e.g. , black holes or machos ) .",
    "the latter case leads to enhanced power on microarcsecond scales , which decorrelates point source magnification from galaxy shear .    the convergence angular power spectrum peaks on arcminute scales ( @xmath17 ) , with significant power extending for multiple decades in @xmath18 .",
    "all of this power contributes to the magnification of ( almost ) point sources like supernovae . when measuring shear , however , galaxy correlations must be averaged over large angular patches to suppress poisson noise , and this averaging washes out small scale power .",
    "for example , if we smooth over arcminute - sized patches , we see that a considerable fraction of the fluctuations affecting the brightness of point sources are not probed by the smoothed galaxy shear map .",
    "this hints that shear maps will be of only limited value .",
    "the convergence power spectrum gives the variance in effective convergence @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the comoving radial distance ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the matter power spectrum ( per logarithmic interval physical wavenumber ) . here , and",
    "in what follows , we restrict ourselves to cosmologies with flat spatial sections ( @xmath24 ) . for the power spectrum shown in figure  [ angpow ]",
    "we find @xmath25 for sources at @xmath10 . in the weak lensing limit",
    ", the magnification of a given source , @xmath26 , is related to the convergence by @xmath27 .",
    "this variance in @xmath8 thus corresponds to a @xmath28 spread in standard candle flux of @xmath29 .    , for @xmath30 , @xmath14 , @xmath31 , and @xmath11 .",
    "we use the fitting functions of @xcite for the linear power spectrum ( cobe normalized ) , and the fitting functions of @xcite for the nonlinear power spectrum .",
    "note that the convergence power spectrum peaks at angular scales of about an arcminute .",
    "smoothing on these scales ( or smaller ) will therefore average away much of the convergence power . ]",
    "we define @xmath32 as the effective convergence averaged over a circular patch on the sky of radius @xmath6 , which is to be determined by shear measurements ( e.g. , using the algorithm of @xcite ) . if @xmath33 is the variance in @xmath8 , then by measuring galaxy shear we can reduce the variance in the corrected convergence of the supernova image to @xmath34 , where the correlation coefficient ( in the absence of shot noise ) is given by @xmath35 .",
    "this expression strictly holds for a gaussian convergence probability distribution function ; although the weak lensing convergence pdf deviates somewhat from gaussianity  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we nonetheless expect the above expression for @xmath36 to be a reasonable ballpark estimate of the correction factor",
    ". it may be interesting to explore whether non - gaussian pdf s can lead to superior correction .",
    "assuming we can write the shot noise term contribution to @xmath37 as @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the intrinsic galaxy ellipticity and @xmath40 the number of source galaxies inside the smoothing area ( @xmath41 is the background galaxy number density ) , we have @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 .",
    "this is as expected : with a perfect lensing shear map , we can fully correct for lensing magnification .",
    "the correlation functions can all be computed using the nonlinear matter power spectrum @xcite , @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the bessel function of the first kind , and @xmath50 with @xmath51 describing the radial distribution of the sources and @xmath52 the comoving distance to the horizon .",
    "if all of the source galaxies being utilized for the shear measurements are at the same redshift as that of the supernova ( @xmath53 ) , we have @xmath54 . for a given background galaxy density",
    ", this case represents the optimal shear correction to the convergence . for the more realistic case of source galaxies distributed in redshift",
    ", we adopt a population distribution described by @xmath55  @xcite , and set @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 corresponding to a mean redshift of @xmath59 . although this galaxy distribution is simplistic ( e.g. , modulo an overall scaling factor it is independent of survey depth and filters ) , it is sufficient to indicate the decorrelation arising from the spread in galaxy redshifts .",
    "these two cases circumscribe the range of @xmath36 when tomographic information , such as photometric redshifts , are employed .    for each value of the background galaxy density",
    "there is a tradeoff between the shot noise term , which decreases for large smoothing angles , and the cross - correlation term , which is weaker for large smoothing angles . the smoothing angle , @xmath6 , which maximizes the cross - correlation coefficient , @xmath36 , is shown as a function of @xmath41 in figure  [ theta ] , for an intrinsic galaxy ellipticity of @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding values of the cross - correlation coefficient are shown in figure  [ rsq ] .",
    "the dashed curves represent the optimal correction , where all the source galaxies are at the same redshift as that of the supernova .",
    "the solid curves are for the galaxy redshift distribution described above .",
    "from figure  [ rsq ] it is apparent that shear maps will be of limited value in reducing the lensing dispersion of supernova brightnesses , unless the number density of background galaxies is great enough to permit sufficiently small smoothing angles .",
    "for example , if the number density of background galaxies is as high as @xmath61 , then at best we find a value for the cross - correlation coefficient of @xmath62 .",
    "if the uncorrected convergence variance is @xmath63 , then we find the variance for the corrected supernovae convergence to be @xmath64 .",
    "this yields an rms magnification of @xmath2 , which is a 20% improvement over the uncorrected value of @xmath65 .",
    "this represents the optimal case discussed above , where all of the source galaxies are at the same redshift as that of the supernova . including the expected spread in galaxy redshifts provides a more reasonable estimate of @xmath66 , giving a reduction in the rms magnification of the supernova of around @xmath67 .",
    "it is to be emphasized that this is an improvement ( reduction ) in the width of the observed supernova magnification distribution , and not a change in the mean ( which remains at @xmath68 ) .",
    "in addition , the _ intrinsic _ dispersion in supernova luminosities causes a further contribution to the observed rms standard candle magnification luminosity .",
    "tomographic information can do little to ameliorate the situation .",
    "the simplest approach would be to confine the shear analysis to source galaxies in a slab in redshift space centered on the supernova . by doing this",
    "one moves up and to the left of the solid curve in figure  [ rsq ] , trading off increased shot noise for more effective lensing information .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that there is a net improvement if @xmath69 of the galaxies are at similar redshifts to that of the supernova .",
    "more inspired schemes might attempt to employ the information contained in galaxies at all redshifts ; regardless , for a given effective galaxy density the theoretical limit is still bounded by the dashed curve in figure  [ rsq ] .",
    "our model for the distribution of galaxy source images in redshift space is particularly simple  more realistic models ( e.g. with dependence on survey depth ) may also push one closer to the dashed curve .",
    "the estimate presented here is optimistic in that we assume that the smoothed convergence field may be directly measured . in reality , the shear field is measured , and then converted to a convergence map  @xcite . even in this optimistic approximation , at best meager returns are expected from the construction of shear maps of surrounding galaxies .",
    "an additional caveat is that we have assumed the noise is dominated by poisson noise in the number of source galaxies .",
    "additional systematic errors , such as imprecise measurement of the point spread function , only worsen the decorrelation . note that our conclusions are sensitive to the shape of the convergence angular power spectrum .",
    "if in reality the power spectrum is unlike that of figure  [ angpow ] , and instead has far less small - scale power , then galaxy shear may turn out to be a much more powerful tool for correcting weak lensing of supernovae . at present",
    ", it appears that there is significant small - scale power @xcite , consistent with the values assumed here .",
    "future wide field surveys like the lsst or snap will directly measure the convergence angular power on some of the relevant scales , so it will be possible to check whether the assumptions made here are valid .",
    "assuming , however , that the power spectrum does not significantly depart from that which we have used , the prospects for using galaxy shear to correct supernova brightnesses appear bleak . given the danger of introducing unknown biases in the resulting distance - magnitude relation , it is unclear whether future supernova surveys should attempt the use of lensing shear maps to correct for magnification of supernova brightnesses ."
