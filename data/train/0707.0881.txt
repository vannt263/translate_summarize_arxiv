    "supernova 1993j was discovered in a spiral arm of m81 south south - west of the galaxy s center by garcia ( ripero & garcia , 1993 ) on 28 march 1993 , shortly after shock breakout at @xmath0 0 ut ( wheeler et al.1993 ) on the same day ( @xmath6  d ) .",
    "it subsequently became the optically brightest supernova in the northern hemisphere since sn 1954a and one of the brightest radio supernovae ever detected .",
    "it is also one of the closest extragalactic supernovae ever observed and is second only to sn 1987a as a subject of intense observational and theoretical supernova studies .",
    "this combination allows for sensitive spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric observations and for exceptionally detailed vlbi imaging , the latter giving us the highest relative resolution ever obtained for any radio supernova ( figure  [ f1m81sn ] ) .",
    "combining the radial velocities of the ejecta gas obtained from the optical lines with the transverse _ angular _ velocities of the radio shell obtained from vlbi measurements yields a direct estimate of the distance to the supernova and its host galaxy .",
    "this method , called the expanding shock front method ( esm ) , was used to determine the distance to sn 1979c in m100 in the virgo cluster ( bartel 1985 ; bartel et al .",
    "1985 ; bartel & bietenholz 2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "however the relatively large distance to virgo has made it hard to resolve the supernova in sufficient detail , and an accurate distance estimate for virgo is still pending .    in contrast ,",
    "m81 , the host galaxy of sn  1993j , is much closer .",
    "its distance was recently determined via hst observations of cepheids to be @xmath5  mpc ( freedman et al .",
    "1994 , see also freedman et al .",

    "we report on a detailed comparison between the angular velocities obtained from the vlbi measurements of the radio shell radius and the radial velocities obtained from the doppler shifts of h@xmath1 , h@xmath8 , he i , o[iii ] , and na i optical lines and determine the distance to sn  1993j and its host galaxy m81 with esm .    this paper is the fourth in a series , presenting the results from our vlbi campaign on this supernova ( see bartel et  al .",

    "rupen 2001 ; paper  i ) , we located the explosion center with respect to the nuclear radio source of m81 , thus defining a stable reference point for our images",
    ". we also determined , using model - fitting , the motion of the geometric center of sn 1993j , and comment on the high degree of circular symmetry shown by sn 1993j . in the second paper ( bartel et al .",
    "2002 ; paper  ii ) , we determined the expansion speed of sn 1993j and measured its deceleration as a function of time . in the third paper , we presented a complete series of vlbi images of sn 1993j at 8.4 and 5.0  ghz , along with our latest image at 1.7  ghz ( bietenholz , bartel , & rupen , 2003 ; paper  iii ) . in this fourth paper",
    "we use the main results of each of the previous papers , compare them with optical spectroscopic observations by others , include specific predictions from hydrodynamic simulations of this supernova for comparison with our observations , and determine directly the distance to m81 .    in   [ sobsdat ] , we summarize our vlbi observations and data reduction . in",
    "  [ snmodel ] we describe the generic supernova shell model with its radio and optical emission regions and discuss the origin of the radio and optical emission and the relation of the forward and reverse shock to the measured boundaries of the radio emitting shell . in   [ exp ]",

    "[ disc ] and finally give our conclusions in   [ conc ] .",
    "the observations were described in papers  i and ii . to summarize , we observed sn  1993j at 34 epochs between 1993 and 2001 from @xmath9 to @xmath10  d. at the earliest epoch , at @xmath9  d , we observed only at 22.2 ghz . at",
    "later epochs up to the @xmath11 epoch at @xmath12  d , we observed mostly at 8.4 ghz and often also at 5.0 ghz .",
    "in addition , we also observed at some early epochs at 14.8 ghz and throughout the full eight years sporadically also at 2.3 and 1.7 ghz .",
    "we used a global array of between 9 and 18 telescopes with a total time of 9 to 18 hours for each session .",
    "we have continued observing sn  1993j at approximately one - year intervals and will report on these observations in future papers .",
    "the data were recorded with either the mk  iii or the vlba / mkiv vlbi systems , and correlated with the nrao vlba processor in socorro , new mexico , usa .",
    "we refer the interested reader to paper  ii where details of the observing sessions are tabulated .",
    "the analysis was carried out using nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "most of our observations were phase - referenced to m81@xmath13 , the radio source in the center of the galaxy m81 .",
    "being very compact ( bietenholz et  al .",
    "1996 ) , m81@xmath13 is an excellent calibrator for phase - referenced mapping .",
    "our images are among those with the lowest background noise level currently obtained with vlbi .",
    "bietenholz , bartel , & rupen ( 2000 ) located a fixed point in the variable brightness distribution of m81@xmath13 that also has an inverted radio spectrum ( bietenholz , bartel , & rupen 2004a ) .",
    "we identified this point with the purported supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy . using this point as a reference point allowed us to locate the explosion center of sn  1993j on each of our supernova images with high precision .    in figure  [ f1m81sn ]",
    "we show the galaxy m81 at optical wavelengths .",
    "overlayed is an image of the galaxy at radio wavelengths , with sn  1993j clearly visible in a southern spiral arm . on the right side of the figure",
    "we show the vlbi image of the evolved radio shell which has the highest relative resolution obtained so far ( paper  iii ) .",
    "in addition to imaging , we used model - fitting .",
    "we fit , by weighted least - squares , the two - dimensional projection of a three - dimensional spherical shell of uniform volume emissivity to the calibrated  data consistently for all epochs .",
    "the ratio of the outer to inner angular radius was fixed at /= 1.25 . from this fit",
    ", we estimated the shell s center coordinates , @xmath14 , ( see paper  i ) , and  ( see paper  ii ) .",
    "the shell s center coordinates were found to be equal , within an rms of 64  , to those of the explosion center of sn 1993j . in the image in figure  [ f1m81sn ]",
    "this center is at the origin .",
    "in addition , for relatively late epochs , we also determined the shell thickness by freeing the ratio of the radii and estimating  and  independently .",
    "to clarify the astrophysical interpretation of the radio shell and its relation to the optical absorption and emission by the ejecta , we copied the left part of the vlbi image from figure  [ f1m81sn ] and juxtaposed it to a sketch of a generic supernova shell model in figure  [ f2snmodel ] .",
    "the model describes a supernova expanding into the circumstellar medium ( csm ) left over from the progenitor star .",
    "the supernova ejecta are spherically , freely expanding away from the explosion center for a large range of radii , @xmath15 , from that center .",
    "their temperature is @xmath16  k. the ejecta in the outermost regions hit the csm , and a contact surface forms between the two media at a radius , @xmath17 . from this surface ,",
    "a forward shock , located at a radius , @xmath18 , travels into the csm and heats it up to @xmath19  k. outside the forward shock , the csm is unshocked and has a relatively high temperature of 10@xmath20 to 10@xmath21  k ( lundqvist & fransson 1988 ; fransson & bjrnsson 1998 ; mioduszewski , dwarkadas , & ball 2001 ) .",
    "also , a reverse shock travels from the contact surface back into the ejecta to a radius , @xmath22 , from the explosion center and heats up the shocked ejecta to a temperature of @xmath23  k. the contact surface itself is rayleigh - taylor unstable , and fingers of ejecta are expected to develop and extend into the shocked csm .",
    "these fingers are also sketched in figure  [ f2snmodel ] .",
    "this general scenario above was described mathematically by the mini - shell model of self - similar expansion ( chevalier 1982a , b ; see also fransson , lundqvist , & chevalier 1996 ) .",
    "this model assumes power - law density profiles for both the ejecta and the csm , with @xmath24 ( @xmath255 ) , and @xmath26 . with this assumption ,",
    "the expansion is self - similar , and the shock radius is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the deceleration parameter , which is constant and is given by @xmath29 . a hydrodynamic model for sn  1993j by mioduszewski et al .  ( 2001 ) , based on an ejecta model by shigeyama et al .  ( 1994 )",
    "( see also suzuki & nomoto 1995 ) , relaxed the assumption of a power - law density profile in the ejecta .",
    "this model described the expansion of sn 1993j in more detail , and accounted for the deviations from self - similar expansion which were found for this supernova ( paper ii ) .",
    "the expanding shock front method is based on the transverse velocity of the rayleigh - taylor unstable contact surface being equal to the largest radial velocity of the ejecta .",
    "dividing the latter by the former gives a geometric determination of the distance to the supernova and its host galaxy . in the following",
    "we will describe how the contact surface velocity distorted by rayleigh - taylor instabilities is related to the expansion velocity of the outer surface of the radio shell and how it compares with the maximum velocities measured in optical lines of the ejecta .",
    "it is believed that the forward shock accelerates electrons to ultrarelativistic velocities .",
    "these relativistic electrons then interact with the magnetic field amplified near the rayleigh - taylor unstable contact surface ( e.g. , chevalier , blondin , & emmering 1992 ; jun & norman 1996a , b ) .",
    "this interaction leads to radio synchrotron radiation .",
    "radio emission is therefore expected to originate in the shell region of the shocked csm and likely also the shocked ejecta , i.e. , in a region bound by @xmath30 and @xmath18 .",
    "no radio emission is expected from the freely expanding , unshocked ejecta .",
    "radio emission could also originate from a central compact source associated with the stellar remnant of the explosion , namely a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "although a compact source was indeed found inside the shell of sn 1986j ( bietenholz , bartel , & rupen 2004b ) , no emission from such a source has yet been detected for sn  1993j or any other modern supernova ( e.g. , bartel & bietenholz 2005 ) .",
    "how can our radio images of sn  1993j be interpreted in detail in the context of this astrophysical model ?",
    "the radio image of sn  1993j in figure  [ f1m81sn ] shows an exemplary shell of emission . in general , the outer angular radii ,  of our geometric shell model could be determined with an accuracy of about 1 to 2% and , for our latest images , the mean ratio of the outer to inner shell radii , / , to within 1% ( paper ii ) . in figure  [ f2snmodel ]",
    "we plot the fit geometric shell model as overlayed concentric circles with radii of  and .",
    "the center of the model circles is at the explosion center within 64  which corresponds to only about 1% of  ( paper i ) .",
    "our finding that the radio emission can be so well fit by a spherical shell centered at the explosion center strongly supports the expectation that the fit angular radii , and , indeed correspond to the radii of the forward and reverse shocks , @xmath18 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "other supernovae may not show such exemplary shells of emission and would therefore not be as good examples to show the close relationship between the radio shell boundaries and the forward and reverse shocks although that relationship most likely also exists given the example of sn 1993j .",
    "both the self - similar mini - shell model and the hydrodynamic model make predictions as to the distance between the forward and the reverse shocks . during the first months , when @xmath31 ( paper ii ) , the ratio between the forward and reverse shock radii is predicted to be @xmath32 for @xmath33 for the self - similar mini - shell model . for a larger deceleration the shell thickness",
    "is predicted to be larger .",
    "for instance , with the mean of @xmath28 for the whole observing time up to @xmath34  d of @xmath35 ( paper ii ) , a ratio of @xmath36 is observed and @xmath37 inferred to change with time , and the evolution is in general not self - similar ( paper ii ) , the ratio may differ somewhat from the predicted value . ]",
    "is predicted by the self - similar mini - shell model for @xmath33 ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) .",
    "similar and most likely more reliable values for the shell thickness are predicted by the hydrodynamic model .",
    "in fact , dwarkadas & chevalier ( 1998 ) found that the shell thickness is relatively independent of the form of the ejecta profile for a long time after shock breakout , further supporting its robustness . in figure  [ f3rorilogsim ]",
    "we plot the ratio of the forward and reverse shock radii from a few days to several years after the explosion as derived from the hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the ratio increases from 1.16 between @xmath38  d and 20  d to an average of @xmath39 between @xmath40  d and @xmath41  d. in addition we plot our measurements from vlbi observations , / , determined at epochs from @xmath42  d onward when the radio shell was large enough to allow useful determinations . the mean of /  for epochs up to @xmath12  d after the explosion was @xmath43 , with a slight broadening of the shell ( significant only at the @xmath44 level , see paper ii ) , in good agreement with the models .",
    "this good agreement is additional evidence that the radio shell is indeed bound by the forward and reverse shocks .",
    "below the image of the half radio shell in figure  [ f2snmodel ] we plot the profile of the fit geometric shell model in several aspects . the data points give the observed profile .",
    "the solid curve gives the fit to the data of a ( projected ) shell model with uniform emissivity between  and  and partial absorption inside  ( paper iii ) .",
    "the rectangular lines give the profile in the ( unprojected ) cross section of the shell .",
    "clearly , the emission and the region where the emission originates is very well fit by our geometric model . in paper iii we reported on the steepness of the outer edge of the profile and found that it is indeed consistent with being an ideally sharp edge as in our model",
    ". however softer boundaries are not excluded .",
    "nevertheless , the measured brightness profile can be taken as further evidence that the radio shell is indeed bound by the forward and reverse shocks , and that the parameters  and therefore most likely correspond closely to @xmath30 and @xmath45 .",
    "on the right side of figure  [ f2snmodel ] we sketch the minishell model and complete the concentric circles by indeed assuming here and hereafter that  and  correspond exactly to @xmath30 and @xmath18 .",
    "while optical continuum emission of the supernova is expected to mostly originate , at least at early times , from the photosphere in the central region of the expanding gas , optical emission and absorption in broad spectral lines is expected to arise in the gas of the hot ejecta , above the cooler and mostly neutral ejecta ( figure  [ f2snmodel ] . in particular , emission was discussed as coming from a ) the freely expanding ejecta and being caused by the heating and ionizing radiation from the interaction region , as well as from b ) the shocked ejecta and being linked to radiative cooling ( chevalier & fransson , 1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "the ionizing luminosity and the density of the gas both change with time and give rise to evolving spectra .",
    "blending of lines is common , and since the relative luminosities change with time , the degree of blending can change as well .",
    "the highest expansion velocity in absorption and emission lines is expected from the shocked gas of the envelope of the progenitor star , in a region that extends outwards to the rayleigh - taylor unstable contact surface at radius @xmath17 .",
    "the highest _ observed _ optical expansion velocity could be smaller .",
    "no optical line emission is expected from the region of shocked csm , i.e. , beyond the contact surface between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , since the temperature there is expected to be @xmath46  k.        the location of the contact surface in relation to the forward and reverse shocks , i.e. , to the outer and inner radio shell surfaces , is estimated by combining vlbi measurements of the radio shell thickness with circumstellar interaction models . both the self - similar mini - shell model and the hydrodynamic model make predictions as to the distance between the contact surface and the reverse shock . during the first months , when @xmath31 , the ratio between the contact surface and reverse shock radii is predicted to be @xmath47 for @xmath33 by the self - similar mini - shell model . for a larger deceleration ,",
    "e.g. , for a mean of @xmath48 as taken before for a comparison (   [ thickness ] ) , the ratio is @xmath49 ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic model predicts a ratio similarly close to unity during the first month which then increases to a mean value of about 1.04 between @xmath50 and @xmath10  d.    we parametrized  for the range of our radio and the optical observations by = @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the time since explosion in days . with @xmath53 and @xmath54 ,",
    "this parametrization gives a time - varying shell thickness consistent with the hydrodynamic simulations with , e.g. , /  = 1.16 at @xmath55  d and 1.29 at @xmath56  d ( see figure  [ f3rorilogsim ] ) . these values are also fairly consistent with the predictions from the self - similar mini - shell model .",
    "( we also parametrized the angular radius of the contact surface by = @xmath57  with @xmath58 and @xmath59 to give  being 0.65%  and 4%  larger than  at @xmath55  d and 2500  d , respectively , as predicted by the above models .",
    "however , since the contact surface is decelerating , it is expected to be rayleigh - taylor unstable ( gull 1973 ; chevalier 1982b ) , and that with time fingers of shocked ejecta will extend into the shocked csm .",
    "a linear analysis of self - similar solutions as well as two - dimensional numeric hydrodynamic computations have shown that rayleigh - taylor instabilities are limited by kelvin - helmholtz instabilities but can still grow in length to generally 30 to 50% of the width of the shocked shell ( chevalier et al .",
    "1992 ; dwarkadas 2000 ) .",
    "under particular circumstances , when vortices are amplified by the magnetic field , it was shown that the fingers may even reach slightly beyond the outer shock , which is otherwise assumed to be spherically symmetrical ( jun & norman 1996a , b ) .",
    "also , for fast shocks with efficient particle acceleration and resulting high compression ratios , the width of the shocked shell was found to shrink considerably so that fingers , without growing much larger , could also reach and even slightly exceed the average forward shock radius ( blondin & ellison 2001 ) .",
    "the ejecta with the highest velocity are therefore located in the evolving rayleigh - taylor fingers stretching out beyond @xmath17 toward the forward shock at @xmath18 .",
    "the fingers are expected to be less developed a few days after shock breakout and more developed a few years thereafter .",
    "thus , the highest possible velocities in optical lines are those from the front of the rayleigh - taylor fingers which , depending on evolution time , stretch out to between @xmath17 and @xmath18 with an assumed mean , @xmath60 , which corresponds to an angular extent of .",
    "we used the values of @xmath61 obtained from our vlbi observations to compute the angular expansion velocity of the outer surface of the radio shell , i.e. , of the forward shock , @xmath62 , as a function of time .",
    "the values of  were already listed and plotted in paper  ii , but for the convenience of the reader we repeat the plot of  as a function of time here in figure  [ f4exp ] .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the outer surface of the radio shell is only slightly decelerated up to @xmath63  d and from then on more strongly decelerated .",
    "further , as can be seen from the inset of figure  [ f4exp ] , the deceleration changes significantly even after @xmath64  d ( see also paper ii ) .",
    "because the expansion has an approximate power - law form , a linear fit to the values of @xmath61 over a time interval would produce a biased estimate of @xmath62 at the midpoint of the interval . to avoid this bias",
    ", we computed @xmath65 by first fitting a running solution of the form @xmath66 to the data points near @xmath52 , where we fit both the deceleration parameter , @xmath28 , and the angular size scale , @xmath67 .",
    "our running solution is equivalent to a running mean , but instead of computing the weighted average in a shifting interval we computed the weighted linear fit in a shifting interval in a log - log diagram ( see paper  ii for more details ) . as our value of @xmath65 , we take the derivative of this fitted function , @xmath68 , evaluated at the midpoint of the fitting interval on a logarithmic scale , for each @xmath69 , from the values of @xmath61 for 8 consecutive observing epochs from @xmath70 to @xmath71 .",
    "we started with the data from the first epoch at @xmath72 to the eighth epoch at @xmath73 for the first solution ( @xmath74 ) , and continued till @xmath75 was the last epoch .",
    "for each @xmath69 , we fit for the values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the time at which these fitted values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 are taken to apply , @xmath78 , is the geometric mean of the start and end times of the segment , i.e. , @xmath79 . at @xmath78",
    "we take the angular velocity to be given by @xmath80 . ] .",
    "we extrapolated the angular velocity values slightly beyond the mean times of the first and last running solutions to cover the time range from @xmath81 to @xmath10  d. we plot the values of  and connect them by lines in figure  [ f5radvellogm ] .",
    "we also estimate standard errors from the power - law fits .",
    "these errors are between 1 and 5% of .",
    "we plot them also in figure  [ f5radvellogm ] .",
    "we further compute the angular velocity of the inner surface of the radio shell , i.e. of the reverse shock , , the velocity of the contact surface , , and the mean between the velocity of the contact surface and that of the forward shock , , and also plot them in figure  [ f5radvellogm ] . the ratios of the parametrized velocities , /  and / , are comparable to those from the hydrodynamic simulations after the latter are smoothed over appropriate time intervals . ,",
    "predicted by the hydrodynamic simulations ( figure  [ f3rorilogsim ] ) shows an oscillation at late times which corresponds to an oscillation of the ratio @xmath82",
    ". however , our data are also consistent with our simple parametrized function which does not oscillate .",
    "our ratios of the parametrized velocities at late times are similar to the mean of the high and low values of the oscillation of the velocity ratios from the hydrodynamic simulation . ]",
    "we list the maximum expansion velocities found in optical lines of hydrogen , oxygen , and sodium in table  [ t1vopt ] .",
    "we obtained the earliest velocities from measurements by finn et al .",

    "the maximum velocities are larger .",
    "since an absorption profile was not published , we needed to calculate the maximum velocities on the basis of absorption profiles at overlapping times published by others . for @xmath38 to 19  d",
    ", maximum velocities of @xmath85  were obtained from the blue edge of the h@xmath1 absorption trough ( trammell et al .",
    "1993 ; lewis et al .",
    "1994 ) . since at @xmath38  d",
    "the maximum velocity is 1400  higher than the velocity at the absorption minimum , we added 1400  to finn et al.s values to obtain the maximum velocities also for @xmath83 to 9  d. the highest velocity is 19,200  at @xmath83  d.    at later times the absorption trough first shrank , most likely due to blending at the blue side with the rising [ oi ] @xmath86 6300 , 6364 emission doublet profile from @xmath87  to @xmath88  between @xmath55  d to @xmath89  d. from the spectra in this time range ( matheson et al .",
    "2000a ) it appears that the sharp decrease is caused by the [ oi ] @xmath86 6300 , 6364 emission doublet filling in the blue side of the h@xmath1 trough even at these early times . ] .",
    "then the trough disappeared due to h@xmath1 becoming optically thin ( see , e.g. , houck & fransson 1996 ) , and the maximum velocity for h@xmath1 could only be derived from the h@xmath1 emission lines .",

    "matheson et al.s ( 2000b ) values do not differ from our determined values significantly , except at @xmath90 and 553  d where we think that their bvzi values are underestimates .",
    "these underestimates are likely caused by a misinterpretation of the baseline level , which we believe is taken too high due to the still present blend of the o[i ] @xmath86 6300 , 6364 emission doublet ( see   [ comparison ] ) . ] .",

    "figure  [ f6halphaalllogmd ] further shows that the earliest rvzi values , from @xmath96 to @xmath97  d , are @xmath020% smaller than the corresponding bvzi values .",
    "at later times , however , the rvzi values agree within the errors with the bvzi values .",
    "furthermore , a relatively large discrepancy exists between the rvzi and rvhi values at early times , the latter being almost 60% smaller than the former .",
    "this discrepancy decreases at later times due to a steepening of the red side of the h@xmath1 line profile . at @xmath98  d ,",
    "the rvzi and rvhi values are different by only @xmath020% and match the corresponding values on the blue side , indicating a largely symmetric profile with steep red and blue sides .",
    "these characteristics of the h@xmath1 profile at times up to @xmath99  d indicate that the red side may be biased by absorption , likely by dust mixed in with the ejecta .",

    "( 2005 ) , gerardy et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and deneault , clayton , & heger ( 2003 ) .",
    "the maximum velocity of the h@xmath1 line emitting gas is therefore best revealed by the bvzi ( absorption and emission ) values at all times and the rvzi ( emission ) values for @xmath98  d emission profile at early times ( @xmath52=255  d ) with an unidentified feature reported to be present in type ib / c supernovae but limited the emission to not more than 30% of that of h@xmath1 .",
    "however , this feature , visible in patat et al.s ( 1995 ) example , can not be seen in the spectrum of sn 1993j .",
    "further , chevalier & fransson ( 1994 ) computed that another line , [ n ii ] @xmath846548 - 6583 , could be blended with the h@xmath1 line . however , at @xmath100  yr its luminosity would be only @xmath05% of that of the h@xmath1 line and at @xmath101  yr only 20 to 25% . these limits and the time frame of the occurrences of these possible blends together with the near consistency of the rvzi with the bvzi values for @xmath98  d are strong indications that our values are not significantly affected by blending with such lines . ] .",
    "how well does the deceleration of the radio shell match that derived from the maximum velocities from the optical lines ? in table  [ t2mfit ] we compare the deceleration parameter of the radio shell , @xmath28 , with that of the line absorbing or emitting gas , @xmath102 , for the lines discussed above and for different time ranges . in particular we compute @xmath103 from @xmath104 , @xmath105 from @xmath106 , @xmath107 from @xmath108 , and @xmath109 from @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the maximum velocity of the line absorbing or emitting gas .",
    "we first computed the deceleration of the radio shell and that of the h@xmath1 line absorbing and emitting gas for the total time range .",
    "here we had to consider the uneven sampling of the radio and optical data .",
    "since the deceleration is changing with time , a fit with a single deceleration parameter would depend strongly on the weighting scheme .",

    "however , such a fit represents a strong mismatch to the earliest data . for a better comparison with the optical data including the earliest data from @xmath83 to 19",
    "d we increased the weighting of the early radio data by forcing the fit through the earliest radio data point at @xmath9  d. for the optical data such weighting was not necessary mostly due to the large gap at intermediate times .",
    "the resulting `` average '' deceleration parameter for the h@xmath1 gas is equal within the errors combined in quadrature to that of the outer surface of the radio shell and that of the surface between the latter and the contact surface ( solution 1 in table  [ t2mfit ] ) .",
    "the equality within the errors also holds for the early time interval ( solution 2 in table  [ t2mfit ] ) . for the late time interval ,",
    "the h@xmath1 line absorbing and/or emitting gas is slightly , but significantly , less decelerated than the radio shell with a difference in the deceleration parameters of 0.092 ( 4@xmath113 ) and 0.099 ( 4@xmath113 ) between the optical line emitting gas on the one hand and the outer surface of the radio shell and the surface between the later and the contact surface , respectively , on the other hand ( solution 3 in table  [ t2mfit ] ) .",
    "somewhat larger discrepancies in the sense of less deceleration are found for the o[iii ] and na i line emitting gas .",
    "the largest discrepancy is found for the h@xmath8 line - emitting gas , where no significant deceleration was measured .",

    "however , we think that these estimates do not reflect the real distance of m81 but rather the smaller maximum radii and velocities of the observed o[iii ] and na i line gas in the ejecta .",
    "the systematic errors of our distance estimate mostly depend on how reliably the radio and optical velocities can be equated . in this context , the degree of isotropy of the expansion and the spatial relation between the radio and optical emission regions are important factors .",
    "we have identified seven items concerning systematic uncertainties and elaborate on them below .",
    "_ large scale anisotropy of the radio expansion : _    the degree of isotropy of the expansion of the outer radio shell , at least in the plane of the sky , can be determined most directly by measuring the angular expansion of individual segments of the supernova from a fixed reference point in the frame of the host galaxy .",
    "such measurement was made for sn  1993j relative to m81@xmath13 , the core of the nuclear region of the galaxy , and resulted in a limit on anisotropic motion in any direction in the plane of the sky of 5.5%  ( paper i ) .",
    "more stringent limits can be set on the ellipticity of the supernova s projection . for our composite image in figure  [ f1m81sn ] ,",
    "an ellipse fitted to the 20% contour is circular even to within 1% .",
    "we take the mean of these two anisotropy measurements of 3% for the 1@xmath113 contribution to the systematic error .",
    "_ small scale anisotropy of the radio expansion : _    as we reported in paper iii , the composite image in figure  [ f1m81sn ] shows an apparent small protrusion to the southwest .",
    "such protrusions may result from rayleigh - taylor instabilities of the contact surface , which causes vortices through the region of the shocked csm between  and .",
    "such vortices are expected to show enhanced polarization .",
    "no significant polarization has however been found in several of the images we analyzed , with a 3@xmath113 limit of 9% of the image peak averaged over the beam size .",
    "further , the significance of the protrusion itself is marginal .",
    "the noise - corrected 1-@xmath113 upper limit on the rms variation of the radius of the 20% contour is 3% ( paper iii ) .",
    "since our radio shell expansion velocity is that of a fit spherical shell model and is therefore azimuthally averaged , the effect of the occurrence of protrusion would be absorbed in the statistical error of the expansion and does therefore not have to be considered as a separate element in the error budget .",
    "it needs however to be considered again under item 4 below .",
    "_ large scale anisotropy of the expansion of the optical line emitting and absorbing ejecta : _    in view of the almost perfect circularity of the outer edge of the radio shell it would be surprising if the geometry of the outer layers of the ejecta were notably different .",
    "by contrast , the significant linear polarization that was discovered in the early optical spectra and continuum indicates that some asymmetries were likely present in the ejecta up to a few weeks after shock breakout .",
    "these asymmetries were successfully modelled with different geometries by hflich ( 1995 ) , hflich et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and tran et al .",
    "( 1997 ) including one with a spherical outer ejecta envelope and an off - center source ( hflich 1995 ) , such as may be expected since the progenitor of sn 1993j was a member of a binary system ( maund et al .",

    "tran et al .  ( 1997 ) also discussed a model where the ejecta interacted with a clumpy and anisotropically distributed csm .    in any case , in the plane of the sky , the ejecta envelope must have been highly circular and expanding almost isotropically to be consistent with the near circularity of the radio shell from a few weeks ( bartel et al .",
    "1994 ) to several years ( paper iii ) after shock breakout .",
    "what is the evidence for sphericity and almost isotropic expansion in three dimensions ?",
    "first , the good match between the decrease of the bvzi ( abs , em ) and the deceleration of the outer surface of the radio shell .",
    "further , the almost exactly symmetrical and box - like shape of the h@xmath1 emission line after one year , as first noted by filippenko et al .",
    "in particular , for the 11 epochs from @xmath133 to 2454  d , the mean of the ratios of the bvzi to rvzi values is @xmath134 and therefore the bvzi and rvzi values are almost equal in magnitude , which is also reflected in the small differences of the distance estimates of not more than 0.5 mpc or 1.3% relative to 3.96 mpc ( table  [ t3dfit ] , solutions 3 , 4 relative to 1 ) .",
    "in fact the late h@xmath1 line profile , at @xmath135  d , can be well fit by a spherical shell of constant emissivity ( fransson et al .  2005 ) with a shell thickness of 30% of the shell s outer radius .",
    "we adopt an uncertainty of our distance estimate due to these asymmetries of 0.05  mpc or 1.3% .",
    "_ small scale anisotropy of the expansion of the optical line absorbing and emitting ejecta : _    the development of rayleigh - taylor fingers at the contact surface certainly leads to small scale anisotropies of the expansion of the ejecta , but their contribution to the distance uncertainty is minimal . first , rayleigh - taylor fingers likely change with time .",
    "however , our distance estimates at early and late times are only different from the estimate of 3.96 mpc ( solution 1 in table  [ t3dfit ] ) by up to 0.05 mpc or 1.3% .",
    "second , any anisotropy should be reflected in the differences of the bvzi and rvzi . however , the distance solutions with the h@xmath1 bvzi em .",
    "and rvzi values are only different from the estimate of 3.96  mpc by 0.05 mpc or again 1.3% .",

    "we considered the possibility that the radio shell was in fact prolate or oblate , but fortuitously aligned so that its projection in the plane of the sky was almost circular , in other words aligned in such a way that the long ( prolate case ) or short ( oblate case ) axis was pointing toward us at a small angle .",
    "the radial expansion velocity would then be larger ( prolate case ) or smaller ( oblate case ) than the transverse one , but the observed radial and transverse symmetry properties would be retained .",
    "consider , for example , a prolate spheroid , with the long axis 10% larger than its other two axes .",
    "a numerical calculation shows that such a spheroid , randomly oriented , has only a 7% chance of being aligned so that its projection on the plane of the sky is circular to within 1.4% , as is observed for sn  1993j ( paper i , see also paper iii ) . in this case",
    ", we would overestimate the distance by @xmath09% since the radial velocities would in fact be larger than the tangential ones .",
    "the error in the distance and the odds _ against _ fortuitous alignment are both roughly proportional to the deviation of the long axis from the others .",
    "the chances for the alignment of oblate objects are similarly small , but the distance error would have the opposite sign . since such alignments are unlikely , we do not consider them further .",
    "_ spatial relation between the optical and radio regions : _    the spatial relation between the radio and optical emission regions which is conceptually shown in figure  [ f2snmodel ] is empirically fairly well supported by the correspondence between our measurements of the shell thickness and that predicted by analytical computations ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) and hydrodynamic simulations ( mioduszevski et al .",
    "we think that the largest uncertainty of the spatial relation is linked to the unknown growth of the rayleigh - taylor fingers with time and the corresponding slight differences in the deceleration of the h@xmath1 line absorbing and emitting gas , the contact surface and the outer surface of the radio shell or the forward shock .",
    "while the h@xmath1 line absorbing gas ( early times ) is less decelerated within 1@xmath113 , the h@xmath1 line emitting gas ( late times ) is less decelerated within 4@xmath113 ( solutions 2 and 3 , respectively , in table  [ t2mfit ] ) .",
    "it appears that the h@xmath1 emitting gas at its measured maximum velocity as given in table  [ t1vopt ] is continuously expanding further into the space between the contact surface and the forward shock front . this is a sign that rayleigh - taylor fingers are progressively eating further into the shocked csm .",
    "the range of the possible extent of the rayleigh - taylor fingers determines the distance error contribution due to this item , provided that the gas in the rayleigh - taylor fingers remains in the range of the temperature for balmer line absorption and emission in the first place .",
    "we determined the error contribution through boundary conditions .",
    "the upper limit was computed by assuming that at the earliest time the hydrogen gas has not yet expanded into the shocked csm through rayleigh - taylor fingers but rather extends just to the contact surface .",
    "we solved for the distance by fitting the angular velocity of the contact surface to the bvzi abs .",
    "values from @xmath83 to @xmath138  d. we get a value for the distance of @xmath139  mpc .    the lower limit was computed by prohibiting the hydrogen gas velocity from exceeding the forward shock velocity at any time , since we have not yet seen any significant protrusions in the radio shell images .",
    "because of the deceleration of the hydrogen gas being slightly weaker at late times than that of the forward shock , to be conservative , the computation was done for the latest times .",

    "we take the uncertainty from solution 1 in table  [ t3dfit ] . for the systematic errors we consider our elaborations above and the range of solutions listed in table  [ t3dfit ] .",
    "the largest contribution is the uncertainty of relating the locations of the optical and radio emission , which is largely related to the uncertainty of the growth of the rayleigh - taylor fingers over time .",

    "we will discuss each of the aspects in turn .",
    "a few aspects of the results mentioned in the previous section deserve further discussion .",
    "first , the rvzi and rvhi h@xmath1 values for @xmath148  d to @xmath149  d indicate a moderately sloped red side , with the rvzi values well below the velocity of the reverse shock and with the rvhi values showing no indication of deceleration ( compare figures  [ f6halphaalllogmd ] and [ f7halphablueradvellogmd ] ) .",
    "second , for @xmath150500  d , the h@xmath1 profile is very symmetric , with steeply sloped blue and red sides .",
    "third , the distance estimates with the h@xmath1 abs . at early times and h@xmath1 em . at late times are equal to within 0.09 mpc or 2%",
    ". and fourth , at late times the radio shell is slightly more decelerated than the line emitting gas .",
    "the first point may indicate that at early times the red side of the h@xmath1 line profile is affected significantly by the light passing through the interior of the supernova and that with time and decreasing density in the interior , this effect on the line profile diminished .",
    "an alternative interpretation , that a couple of weeks after shock breakout , the h@xmath1 emitting gas was spread irregularly through a much larger fraction of the ejecta on the far side than on the near side of the expanding supernova , is less attractive in view of the box - like emission profile seen later on . the h@xmath1 line emitting gas would have to develop from a one - sided irregular geometry to a spherical shell with fairly well defined boundaries , which is unlikely .",
    "the second point indicates that the h@xmath1 line emitting region is very symmetric along the line of sight , at least for @xmath150500  d. indeed the high degree of symmetry , with the magnitudes of the maximum velocities in the two radial directions being equal to within 2.4% , is similar to the degree of circular symmetry in the plane of the sky , to within 1.4% of the radio shell s outer edge , making it highly likely that the radio shell as well as the h@xmath1 line emitting gas shell are spherically symmetric .",
    "the third point indicates that , assuming that the maximum observed velocities are indeed those of the tip of rayleigh - taylor fingers , any evolution of such fingers from @xmath83  d to @xmath03000  d is , on average , rather constrained . no matter whether we used a ) , b ) , or c )  to solve for the distance , implicitly assuming that these fingers a ) reached the forward shock , b ) were largely constrained to the contact surface , or c ) reached to half way in between the contact surface and the forward shock , the distance estimates for @xmath90 to 2454  d were larger by only a ) 0.06@xmath70.09 , b ) 0.23@xmath70.12 , and c ) 0.09@xmath70.08  mpc than those for @xmath83 to 19  d.    the somewhat larger discrepancy of 0.23@xmath70.12  mpc when using , could have several interpretations . it could be taken as an argument against the respective distance solution of 4.33  mpc which is anyway larger than our 1@xmath113 upper limit of the distance . it could also be taken as information on the shell thickness at early times , the evolution of the rayleigh - taylor fingers at late times , or the separation of the contact surface from the forward shock , since using  for the fit is , in comparison to using  or more dependent on these parameters . the shell thickness would have to be slightly larger than assumed .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath83 to 19  d , @xmath151 would have to be 1.22@xmath70.03 , rather than 1.16 as assumed , in order to give a better fit , that is the same distance for @xmath83 to 19  d as for @xmath90 to 2454  d. as an alternative , the rayleigh - taylor fingers would have to have only slightly expanded into the shocked csm toward the forward shock at @xmath152 to 3000  d. ( see figure  [ f10halphahbetaradvelcdlogmd ] ) .",
    "lastly , it is possible that at late times the contact surface itself or the base of the rayleigh - taylor fingers has moved closer to the forward shock than assumed .",
    "taking into consideration any of these alternatives would improve the quality of the fit to that obtained using  or .",
    "in other words , there is in fact marginal evidence that one or more of these alternatives actually apply .",
    "the fourth point indicates that the comparison of the radio and optical deceleration may provide a sensitive way of probing the evolution of the rayleigh - taylor fingers for particular time intervals .",
    "while the radio and optical decelerations for the total time and at early times are equal within the combined standard errors , the radio deceleration is slightly but significantly larger than the optical deceleration for @xmath153  d. this difference may indeed be indicative of the rayleigh - taylor fingers eating into the shocked csm .",
    "the o[iii ] and na i line emitting gas is also significantly decelerated , slightly less than the h@xmath1 line emitting gas , but within the errors of the former .",
    "its velocity is 12% smaller and may not be as much influenced by the reverse shock as the h@xmath1 gas . a smaller deceleration , if any at all , is therefore expected .",
    "the nearby spiral galaxy m81 is considered an important one for the determination of the extragalactic distance scale and the hubble constant , @xmath154 , since it is used as a calibrator for various methods of determining distances and also since it can be used for a comparison of the various methods .",
    "how does our esm distance compare with other distance determinations to m81 or sn  1993j ?",
    "in table  [ t5distdet ] we compare our determination with those obtained with methods that depend on an absolute calibration scheme and those obtained with methods that , like esm , give the distance directly .",
    "these latter methods are the expanding photosphere method , or epm ( kirshner & kwan 1974 ; eastman & kirshner 1989 ; eastman , schmidt , & kirshner 1996 ) which is a variation of the baade - wesselink method first suggested by baade ( 1926 ) for variable stars and later modified and applied by wesselink ( 1946 ) , and the similar spectral - fitting expanding atmosphere method , or seam ( baron et al .",
    "both methods derive the distance by assuming spherical symmetry and , in effect , combining an estimate of the angular radius with the linear radius of the photosphere or the line - forming region .",
    "the former further assumes that the spectrum of the supernova is approximately that of a blackbody and computes the angular radius via spectral photometry and the linear radius from the velocity of spectral lines and an estimated time of shock breakout .",
    "the latter uses non - lte radiative transfer codes and fits observed spectra with synthetic spectra to determine the spectral energy distribution and the angular and linear radii of the supernova at any given time .",
    "the difficulty in deriving distances with epm is that a velocity needs to be derived from the doppler shift of those lines that are assumed to best match the photospheric velocity , and that a correction factor needs to be computed to account for the differences between the supernova spectral energy distribution and that of a blackbody .",
    "recently , dessart & hillier ( 2005 ) reported on new computations of these correction factors that would increase the epm distances by eastman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) by 10 to 20% . a direct comparison between the epm distance for sn  1999em of @xmath155  mpc ( hamuy et al .",
    "2001 ) , @xmath156  mpc ( leonard et al .  2002 ) , and @xmath157  mpc ( elmhamdi et al .",
    "2003 ) , with the cepheid distance for the host galaxy , ngc 1637 , of @xmath158  mpc ( leonard et al .  2003 ) shows the range of discrepancies .",
    "the difficulty with seam is to compute radiation transport in a rapidly expanding supernova atmosphere so that the resulting synthetic spectra accurately match the observed ones .",
    "for example , the distance to sn  1999em derived with seam was reported to be @xmath159  mpc ( baron et al . 2004 ) , 7% larger than , but within the errors of , the cepheid distance .    in comparison to at least epm , esm has in principle more observable parameters and fewer systematic uncertainties . in esm ,",
    "the transverse expansion velocity is directly measured and not dependent on dilution factors .",
    "changes of the expansion velocity can be measured directly .",
    "the distance determination is almost completely independent of the assumed date of shock breakout .",
    "the isotropy of the expansion can also be measured directly , at least in projection .",
    "what is similar to epm and seam is the difficulty of relating the doppler shift of the spectral lines to the transverse expansion velocity .",
    "our small statistical uncertainty of only 1.3% reflects the good fit of the vlbi expansion curve to the maximum doppler shift of the h@xmath1 line .",
    "our larger systematic uncertainty of @xmath160% includes a 6.3% standard error due to the uncertainty of combining optical and radio velocities , and , omitted from published epm or seam distance determinations , a 3% uncertainty from our measurements on the anisotropy of the transverse expansion of the shock fronts .",
    "our value of @xmath161  mpc is in the upper half of previously determined distances with esm and seam , but consistent with them .",
    "the cepheid distance estimate of @xmath162  mpc by huterer et al.(1995 ) is virtually the same as our esm distance estimate . in this context",
    "it is worth noting that recent distance estimates for the galaxy m82 and the dwarf elliptical galaxies , f8d1 and bk5n have also been similar to our distance estimate for m81 .",
    "the galaxies are all in the same group , and a hi map shows evidence that m81 and m82 have tidally interacted recently .",
    "they have a projected separation of only @xmath163 kpc . using the tip of the red giant branch method ,",
    "madore reported a distance of @xmath164  mpc for m82 and caldwell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) distances of 3.98@xmath70.15  mpc for f8d1 and @xmath165  mpc for bk5n .",
    "these distance estimates are in good agreement with our m81 distance estimate .",
    "in contrast , our distance estimate is 9@xmath713% larger than the cepheid distance estimate of @xmath5  mpc by freedman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , in other words , if the distance to m81 were indeed 3.63 mpc , which is only slightly below our @xmath44 lower limit of 3.67 mpc , then the h@xmath1 absorption between @xmath83 and @xmath92  d and the later h@xmath1 and h@xmath8 emission at @xmath64 would have to occur right up to the forward shock ( see figure  [ f10halphahbetaradvelcdlogmd ] ) .",
    "the most likely interpretation for this scenario would be that the rayleigh - taylor fingers developed strongly right after shock breakout , reached the forward shock at @xmath166  d and and continued to reach the forward shock up to at least @xmath167  d. we consider this scenario to be less likely and instead argue in favor of a larger distance .",
    "direct and cepheid distance determinations can also be compared for the nearby galaxies m33 and ngc 4258 . using a detached eclipsing binary , the distance to m33",
    "was found to be 0.96@xmath70.05  mpc ( bonanos et al .",
    "2006 ) , 14% or @xmath168 the combined uncertainty larger than the cepheid distance of 0.84@xmath70.06  mpc ( freedman et al .",
    "in contrast , the distance derived with maser vlbi is 0.73@xmath169  mpc ( brunthaler et al .",
    "2005 ) , 13% or 0.6@xmath170 the combined uncertainty smaller than the cepheid distance . for ngc 4258 ,",
    "using maser vlbi , the distance is @xmath171  mpc ( herrnstein et al .",
    "this value is 10% or 1@xmath170 the combined uncertainty smaller than the cepheid distance of @xmath172  mpc ( systematic uncertainty not given , total error assumed to be 0.6  mpc , i.e. , the same as that given by newman et al .",
    "2000 ; compare with 8.1@xmath70.4  mpc by maoz et al .",
    "1999 and @xmath173  mpc by newman et al .",
    "it appears that , at least for our examples , distances derived with esm , seam , and by using a detached eclipsing binary , are larger than the cepheid distances by 7 to 14% while the distances derived with maser vlbi tend to be somewhat smaller .",
    "perhaps the systematic uncertainties are still underestimated .",
    "is it possible to derive @xmath154 from our distance estimate alone ?",
    "recently it has been reported that the hubble flow can be extrapolated back to about 2 mpc if it is corrected for peculiar motions caused by the large - scale distribution of matter in the nearby universe ( e.g. , karachentsev et al .",
    "2003 ; sandage et al .",
    "several authors give corrected flow velocities for m81 or the m81 group : tonry et al.(2000 ) give 246  ( given in freedman et al .",
    "2001 for m81 ) and sandage et al .",

    "karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2002 ) give a low velocity , of 106 , but a rather large velocity of 360  for the spatially nearby galaxy m82 .",
    "freedman et al .  (",
    "2001 ) give a similarly low velocity for m81 , of 80 .",
    "such low velocities would lead to unrealistically small values of @xmath154 . clearly , the range of predicted flow velocities for m81 is still too large to be used for a reliable estimate of @xmath154 and our distance estimate for m81 can at best be taken as an indication against a relatively large value for @xmath154 .",
    "is it possible to derive @xmath154 by anchoring the cepheid distance scale to our distance estimate for m81 ? in this respect the cepheid distance modulus of m81 relative to that of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) may be of interest since the lmc is in many studies crucial for the entire cepheid distance scale .",
    "however , different authors derive different relative distance moduli .",
    "for instance , freedman et al.s ( 1994 ) distance modulus for m81 of @xmath176  mag , corresponding to a distance , @xmath177  mpc , is based on the assumption of an lmc modulus of 18.50 mag ( @xmath178  kpc ) .",
    "in contrast , huterer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) obtained , with a different analysis of the same hst data , an m81 modulus of @xmath179  mag ( @xmath180 mpc ) .",
    "this estimate , as mentioned earlier , is essentially identical to our estimate for the distance of m81 . in the same analysis they also obtained an lmc modulus of @xmath181 mag ( @xmath182 kpc )",
    "apparently , different analyses led to distance ratios different by 10% .",
    "huterer et al.s ( 1995 ) lmc distance modulus can be compared with that of @xmath183 mag obtained by macri et al .",
    "( 2006 ) through a determination of the cepheid distance modulus of the maser - host galaxy ngc 4258 relative to that of the lmc and who give an estimate of @xmath184  .",
    "it can also be compared with @xmath185 mag obtained through revised hipparcos parallaxes of cepheids by van leeuwen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who also argue in favor of a revision of sandage et al.s ( 2006 ) and freedman et al.s ( 2001 ) values for the hubble constant to @xmath186  and @xmath187  , respectively .",
    "which value for @xmath154 can we derive with our distance estimate for m81 in view of this discussion ?",
    "freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) obtained , on the basis of their cepheid analysis , @xmath188  .",
    "if the difference between their m81 distance determination and ours is due to a systematic effect , then , on the basis of their cepheid analysis , scaling would lead to @xmath189  , where the uncertainty is one standard error , derived by adding errors in quadrature .",
    "this value can be compared with @xmath1901.3(stat.)@xmath75.0(syst . )",
    "( sandage & tammann 2006 ) .",
    "huterer et al.s ( 1995 ) cepheid distance determinations for m81 and the lmc , however , are consistent with a @xmath191% higher value for @xmath154 .    in conclusion ,",
    "our distance estimate for m81 , which is somewhat larger than freedman et al.s ( 1994 ) estimate , may argue for a correspondingly smaller value of @xmath154 .",
    "however , deriving a reliable value of @xmath154 from our m81 distance determination directly would require a more reliable estimate of m81 s flow velocity than is presently available .",
    "deriving such value of @xmath154 indirectly would require anchoring other distance scales more reliably to our m81 distance determination .",
    "here we list a summary of our main conclusions .    \\1 .",
    "sn 19993j is the best suited supernova yet for determining an accurate geometric distance with the expanding shock front method , esm , by comparing velocities from the doppler shift of optical lines with the vlbi determined velocities of the radio shell .",
    "the brightness profile of the radio shell being consistent with a sharp intensity decline at the outer rim argues in favor of the outer surface of the radio shell being indeed equivalent to the expanding forward shock front .",
    "the thickness of the radio shell being consistent with predictions from hydrodynamic simulations argues in favor of the inner surface of the radio shell being equivalent to the reverse shock front .",
    "the angular expansion velocity of the outer surface of the radio shell could be determined for the time from @xmath192 to @xmath193  d with an uncertainty at early times of @xmath1945% and at late times of @xmath1942% .",
    "the average of the thickness of the radio shell , which is 29% of the radius of the outer radio shell surface for the time @xmath50 to 3000  d , coincides with the average of the thickness predicted by hydrodynamic simulations for that time interval .",
    "changes of the velocity of the radio shell s outer surface at @xmath195 and @xmath196  d , which are reflected by sharp minima in the x - ray lightcurve at these same times , have only partial correspondence in the velocities from the optical lines . at @xmath195  d ,",
    "only h@xmath1 rvzi and rvhi were recorded and do not show any correspondence , providing evidence that the observed h@xmath1 velocities at the far side of the expanding supernova were biased by absorption and do not reflect the velocity of the contact surface . at the less dominant change at @xmath64  d , only the velocities from the h@xmath8 and o[iii ] lines appear to be influenced .",
    "the h@xmath1 gas has with @xmath197 virtually the same ( mean ) deceleration as the outer surface of the radio shell ( forward shock , @xmath198 ) and the surface midpoint between the outer surface and the contact surface ( @xmath199 ) for the total time between @xmath83 and @xmath02500  d. the decelerations are also equal within the errors for the early time interval between @xmath83 and @xmath0300  d. for the late time interval from @xmath200 to @xmath02500  d the h@xmath1 gas is with @xmath201 slightly less decelerated than any of the surfaces of the radio shell .",
    "it is possible that the difference in the deceleration is due to the development of rayleigh - taylor fingers .",
    "the o[iii ] and na i gas is also decelerated , although only with marginal significance .",
    "\\9 . using esm by combining the bvzi values of the h@xmath1 line with the angular velocity half way between that of the contact surface and that of the radio shell s outer surface gives a geometric distance estimate of @xmath202  mpc .",
    "the standard error combines in quadrature a statistical contribution of 0.05  mpc and a systematic contribution of 0.29  mpc .",
    "the distance estimate depends by not more than 0.06 mpc or 1.5% on whether the estimate is obtained with only a ) early h@xmath1 bvzi data from @xmath83 to 19  d , b ) late h@xmath1 bvzi data from @xmath99 to @xmath203  d , c ) h@xmath1 rvzi data , or d ) h@xmath8 bvzi data .",
    "the largest contribution to the error comes from the uncertainty of relating the optical velocities to the radio velocities .",
    "the @xmath44 upper limit of 4.25 mpc corresponds to the h@xmath1 absorption occurring at the earliest time ( @xmath204  d ) only up to the reverse shock .",
    "the @xmath44 lower limit of 3.67 mpc corresponds to the h@xmath1 absorption or emission and h@xmath8 emission occurring as far out as the forward shock which would mean that rayleigh - taylor fingers have developed and stretched out to the forward shock within the errors , from essentially @xmath204 to @xmath205  d.    \\13 .",

    "<S> we compare the angular expansion velocities , determined with vlbi , with the linear expansion velocities measured from optical spectra for supernova 1993j in the galaxy m81 , over the period from 7  d to @xmath09  yr after shock breakout . </S>",
    "<S> the high degree of isotropy of the radio shell s expansion , within 5.5% , with the projection of the radio shell being circular within even 1.4% , and the consistency of the radio shell thickness with predictions from hydrodynamic simulations and analytical computations argue strongly in favor of the radio - emitting shell being bound by the forward and reverse shocks . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption and emission of hydrogen at the highest velocity most likely also arise between the forward and reverse shocks , specifically in the shocked ejecta behind the contact surface which is close to the reverse shock , and possibly in rayleigh - taylor fingers that extend beyond it , farther out into the radio shell but not beyond the forward shock . </S>",
    "<S> the radio shell and the h@xmath1 absorbing and emitting gas are on average similarly decelerated , but the latter slightly less so than the former several years after shock breakout . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate developing rayleigh - taylor fingers , extending progressively further into the shocked circumstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the distance to sn  1993j using the expanding shock front method ( esm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find the best distance estimate is obtained by fitting the angular velocity of a point halfway between the contact surface and outer shock front to the maximum observed hydrogen gas velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a direct , geometric , distance estimate for m81 of @xmath2  mpc with statistical and systematic error contributions , respectively , corresponding to a total standard error of @xmath3  mpc . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limit of 4.25 mpc corresponds to the hydrogen gas with the highest observed velocity reaching no farther out than the contact surface a few days after shock breakout . </S>",
    "<S> the lower limit of 3.67 mpc corresponds to this hydrogen gas reaching as far out as the forward shock for the whole period , which would mean that rayleigh - taylor fingers have grown to the forward shock already a few days after shock breakout . </S>",
    "<S> our distance estimate is @xmath4% larger than that of @xmath5  mpc from the hst key project , which is near our lower limit but within the errors . </S>"
