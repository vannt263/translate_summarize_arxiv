    "small - size bosonic lattices have attracted considerable attention in the last decade since they allow the exploration of a rich variety of dynamical behaviors in which macroscopic nonlinear effects are triggered through a few controllable parameters @xcite-@xcite .",
    "such systems , formed by small arrays of coupled condensates , are governed by the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the boson interaction , @xmath2 represents the tunneling amplitude , and @xmath3 is the population of the condensate at well @xmath4 $ ] in a @xmath5-well lattice . adopted almost thirty years ago to model small molecular systems and study energy - localization effects @xcite-@xcite , equations ( [ dste ] ) still represent the basic theoretic model for studying the dynamics of solitons and of low - energy excitations in lattices @xcite-@xcite where bosons can experience both attractive ( @xmath6 ) and repulsive ( @xmath7 ) interactions .",
    "the appealing feature of small - size lattices is that equations ( [ dste ] ) involve a number of dynamical variables which is small but sufficient to make the system nonintegrable .",
    "thus , while preserving a character simple enough to allow a systematic analytic approach , mesoscopic lattices display strong dynamical instabilities and a variety of behaviors ( including chaos ) typically occurring in longer chains . this circumstance has stimulated a considerable interest in revisiting nonlinear behaviors @xcite , @xcite first studied at the classical level within the fully quantum environment of bosonic lattices @xcite-@xcite .",
    "quantum aspects become relevant for lattices involving low numbers of bosons per well . in this case , a realistic description of microscopic processes is provided by the second - quantized bose - hubbard ( bh ) model @xcite-@xcite @xmath8\\ ! -t \\ !",

    ". equations ( [ dste ] ) , the semiclassical counterpart of model ( [ bhm ] ) , are easily recovered within both the coherent - state @xcite and the continuous - variable @xcite picture showing how operators @xmath9 , @xmath10 are replaced by complex variables @xmath13 , @xmath14",
    ".    theoretical work on mesoscopic lattices has been mainly focused on the three - well array ( trimer ) this being the simplest nonintegrable model of this class of systems .",
    "many interesting aspects of _ semiclassical _ trimer have been explored such as its unstable regimes with both repulsive @xcite and attractive @xcite interaction @xmath1 , the emergence of chaos in the presence of parabolic confinement @xcite , external fields @xcite or off - site interactions @xcite , and discrete breather - phonon collisions @xcite .    almost in parallel ,",
    "the impressive development of laser trapping techniques , has made concrete the possibility to engineer small - size arrays whose dynamics is accessible to experiments .",
    "the most prominent example is the two - well system ( dimer ) @xcite obtained by superposing a ( sinusoidal ) optical potential on the parabolic potential trapping the condensate .",
    "the same scheme should enable the realization of linear chains with an arbitrary number of wells by adjusting the laser wavelength ( determining the interwell distance ) and the parabolic amplitude .    in this scenario ,",
    "the study of trimer dynamics provides a privileged standpoint to better understand the quantum counterpart of nonlinearity and instabilities .",
    "this issue has been discussed in a series of papers examining the spectral properties of _ quantum _ trimer @xcite-@xcite , its description within the phase - variable @xcite and the husimi - distribution @xcite pictures , and the inclusion of higher - order quantum correlations within the multiconfigurational hartree method @xcite .",
    "quantum trimer has been also used to model coherent transport with weak interaction @xcite and thermalization effects within the fokker - planck theory @xcite .",
    "more recently , the single - depleted - well regime of the trimer has been studied in @xcite to evidence the quantum signature of oscillatory instabilities .    in the same spirit , in this paper , we study the quantum aspects of the single - depleted - well regime for an open trimer trapped in a parabolic potential . based on previous work @xcite , @xcite",
    ", we aim , in particular , to obtain 1 ) a satisfactory quantum description of stable macroscopic oscillations characterizing this special regime , and to detect 2 ) significant effects that distinguish the approach to unstable regimes .",
    "the presence of the parabolic trap results in an effective local potential that favors the occupation of the central well . owing the absence of a closed geometry",
    ", the translation - invariant single - depleted - well solution of ring trimers reduces , in the present contest , to a stationary solution where the central well is depleted and the lateral condensates exhibit twin populations and coherent ( opposite ) phases . for this reason the relevant regime",
    "will be called central - depleted - well ( cdw ) regime .",
    "classically , this is represented by trajectories whose initial conditions are close to the cdw fixed point .    the most part of fixed points of the trimer dynamics , which have the form of collective - mode stationary solutions , feature a strong dependence from interaction parameters .",
    "the change of the latter provides various mechanisms whereby one can control the coalescence ( or the formation ) of fixed - point pairs and thus the onset of dramatic macroscopic effects @xcite .",
    "different from the other fixed points , the cdw solution has the special feature to be always present it being independent from the model parameters .",
    "this property is advantageous at the experimental level in that the conditions for realizing configurations close to the cdw state appear to be weakly conditioned by the tuning of physical parameters .",
    "the semiclassical study of the cdw state has shown how its dynamics displays both stable and unstable regimes .",
    "in general , trajectories close to the cdw state exhibit oscillations both of the lateral macroscopically - occupied condensates and of the central condensate which typically involves small fractions of the whole population .",
    "the interest for the cdw regime is motivated by its complex , manifold character which , in addition to a well - known , rich scenario of stable and unstable behaviors , features dynamical modes whose character is at the border between the classical and the quantum behavior .",
    "we will explore this regime showing that an almost exact description can be achieved .",
    "if the small fraction of the central condensate indeed corresponds to a few - boson population , the semiclassical picture must be replaced by a purely quantum - mechanical approach .",
    "apparently , the only variable that must be quantized is the order parameter of the central well while those pertaining to lateral wells ( with many bosons ) are expected to maintain their classical form .",
    "this possibility is only apparent . in this paper",
    "we develop a quantum picture based on replacing some of trimer space modes with collective , momentum - like modes .",
    "this alternative formulation of trimer dynamics and , in particular , of the cdw regime allows one to identify the dynamical variables that really feature a quantum behavior .",
    "the new description is particularly interesting in that the model we obtain can be diagonalized in an exact way by implementing the _ dynamical algebra method _ @xcite .    in section  [ due ]",
    "we review the semiclassical trimer model and its quantum counterpart , and propose our alternative description in terms of momentum - like modes .",
    "section  [ tre ] is devoted to obtain the energy spectrum and the eigenstates for the two regimes characterizing the cdw dynamics .",
    "the diagonalization is made possible by recognizing that algebra sp(4 ) is the dynamical algebra of this model . in section  [ quattro ]",
    "we discuss the energy - spectrum properties for various limiting cases and highlight the link between the parameter - space regions where the spectrum has a discrete character and the regions corresponding to classically stable oscillations .",
    "the occurrence of a continuous spectrum is related to classical instability .",
    "section  [ cinque ] further illustrates this aspect by showing how various delocalization effects characterize the approach to classically unstable regions .",

    "whose initial condition are close to the cdw solution @xmath28 indeed represents a special case owing to its evident independence from interaction parameters @xmath1 , @xmath29 and @xmath2 .",

    "the continuous spectrum is a dramatic manifestation of the transition to the classically - unstable regions .",
    "the discussion of sections [ 4a ] and [ 4b ] shows that both regimes @xmath114 and @xmath181 feature limiting cases where a suitable choice of parameters @xmath197 and @xmath165 allows one to approach the boundaries of the domains classically involving stable oscillations .",
    "the significant change of the spectrum structure observed in such cases is accompanied by a dramatic change of the localization properties of the system . to see this one must consider deviations @xmath287 where @xmath288 represents one of canonical operators @xmath289 , and @xmath98 , and @xmath290 with @xmath291 . the action of propagator @xmath292 on energy eigenstates @xmath293 allows one to considerably simplify this calculation . formulas ( [ aa1 ] ) and ( [ aa2 ] ) show that @xmath294 and @xmath295 in which @xmath296 in the two cases @xmath297 and @xmath200 , one has @xmath298 , @xmath299 , and @xmath300 , @xmath301 , respectively . as a consequence the calculation of expectation values @xmath302 reduces to @xmath303 being @xmath304 in propagator @xmath305 .",
    "one easily shows that @xmath306 so that the determination of @xmath307 amounts to calculating @xmath308 @xmath309 with @xmath310 .",
    "the derivation of such formulas is discussed in appendix [ app4 ] .",
    "let us consider first the approach to boundary @xmath162 characterized by @xmath311 . in the proximity of",

    "hence , equations ( [ delxy1 ] ) and ( [ delqp1 ] ) reduce to @xmath316 @xmath317 clearly showing how such squared deviations diverge owing to the factor @xmath318 .",
    "for @xmath319 ( @xmath320 ) parameter @xmath155 does not vanish any longer whatever value is assumed by @xmath165 .",
    "the delocalization effect is thus restricted to neighborhood of @xmath162 .    concerning the boundaries of @xmath198 , the approach to @xmath207 ( blue curve in fig .",
    "1 ) discloses a somewhat different diverging behavior of squared deviations @xmath321 .",
    "in particular , based on formulas ( [ delxy2 ] ) , ( [ delqp2 ] ) and ( [ lim2 ] ) , one gets @xmath322 @xmath323 in the limit @xmath324 , where factor @xmath325 is responsible for the delocalization effect .",
    "the latter affects only position operators @xmath95 and @xmath97 without involving @xmath96 and @xmath98 .",
    "finally , the limit @xmath266 , describing the approach to the straight line @xmath208 defined by @xmath206 , supplies a third interesting situation . in this case @xmath326 involve an evident squeezing effect where the delocalization issuing from @xmath327 and @xmath328 is compensated by the localization effect concerning @xmath329 and @xmath330 , respectively .",
    "we have studied the quantum - mechanical properties of the bose - hubbard trimer in the cdw regime .",
    "the interesting feature of this regime is that it exhibits both stable and unstable ( classical ) regimes whose dependence on interaction parameters is completely known .",
    "this has given the possibility to study the relation between the stability character of trimer and its quantum properties .",
    "in section  [ due ] , we have introduced an alternative description in terms of momentum - like modes which allows one to identify the classical ( microscopic ) variables involved by the quantization process . in section  [ tre ]",
    "we have enacted the procedure for diagonalizing the trimer hamiltonian based on the knowledge of the model dynamical algebra . within the momentum - mode picture ,",
    "this is found be the algebra sp(4 ) .",
    "the implementation of this procedure reduces the model to a double - oscillator system and allows us to identify the regions @xmath159 and @xmath198 where the spectrum is discrete .",
    "the nice analytic result emerging from this part is that the derivation of ( the boundaries of ) @xmath159 and @xmath198 exactly reproduces the regions where the trimer is classically stable in the cdw regime .",
    "the discussion of section  [ quattro ] makes evident the significant changes of spectrum structure when approaching the boundary of stability domains @xmath331 and @xmath198 .",
    "various delocalization effects , discussed in section  [ cinque ] , confirm the considerable sensitivity of the quantum properties of the system from the proximity to the boundaries of @xmath331 and @xmath198 .",
    "all such effects can be interpreted as the hallmark of the transition to the unstable regions of classical cdw dynamics whose most dramatic manifestation is the onset of a continuous spectrum when the domain of validity of the momentum - mode picture is left .",
    "future work will be focused on extending the investigation of the quantum properties of trimer in more complex regimes ( such as the dimeric and nondimeric regimes studied in refs . @xcite and @xcite ) where the transition to unstable oscillations can be controlled through the model parameters .",
