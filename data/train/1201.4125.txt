    "reverberation ( or echo ) mapping is a time - domain technique to resolve the accretion flow in agns .",
    "this relies on the analysis of time - delayed responses of different emitting regions to original fluctuations in an irradiating source [ 1 ] . while concurrent x - ray - uv - optical continuum monitoring campaigns of low - redshift agns are leading to puzzling results ( e.g. , [ 2 ] ) , there is only one agn at @xmath1 1 with a continuum reverberation map : q0957 + 561 [ 3 ] .",
    "the @xmath0 = 1.41 radio - loud quasar q0957 + 561 suffers a strong gravitational lens effect , so one observes two images q0957 + 561a and q0957 + 561b from earth .",
    "intrinsic flux variations in q0957 + 561b lag those in q0957 + 561a by about 14 months [ 4 ] , and we taken advantage of this time delay between images . optical follow - up observations in late 2008 and the first semester of 2009 showed very prominent variations in q0957 + 561a [ 5 ] , which enabled us to know in advance the flaring behaviour of q0957 + 561b during the first semester of 2010 , and to use the liverpool robotic telescope ( sloan @xmath2 bands ) , the uvot on board the swift satellite ( @xmath3 band ) and the chandra space telescope ( x - rays ) for such a time period .    from the @xmath4 light curves of q0957 + 561b in 2010 , we measured interband delays of several days that were consistent with a centrally irradiated , standard accretion disk [ 3 ] . in this scenario , a flaring source very close to the central supermassive black hole illuminates a standard accretion disk .",
    "the central flares are then thermally reprocessed into fuv - muv variations in the inner disk to produce the observed nuv - optical variability . in section 2",
    "we present the nir observations and the corresponding light curves , which were not discussed in [ 3 ] .",
    "these new nir data are used to check the accretion scenario and discuss in detail the disk radial structure . in section 3",
    "we infer possible reconstructions of the effective luminosity of the central irradiating source from the nuv - optical - nir light curves .",
    "our main conclusions appear in section 4 .",
    "in 2010 , we conducted a nir monitoring programme of q0957 + 561 with the ratcam ccd camera on the liverpool robotic telescope at la palma , canary islands .",
    "the exposure times were 120 and 240 s per night in the @xmath5 and @xmath0 bands , respectively .",
    "the pre - processing steps included in the telescope pipeline are : bias subtraction , overscan trimming and flatfielding .",
    "in addition , we interpolate over bad pixels using the bad pixel mask , clean some cosmic rays and remove fringe patterns . our crowded - field photometry pipeline is then used to produce instrumental fluxes of both quasar images over 54 epochs . to achieve a reasonable compromise between photometric quality and sampling rate ,",
    "later we apply thresholds on the signal - to - noise ratio in the @xmath5 and @xmath0 bands .",
    "the final processing stage consists of the conversion from instrumental magnitudes to physical fluxes ( in mjy ) , and the final nir fluxes are available at ` http://grupos.unican.es/glendama/lqlmii_dr.htm ` .",
    "we also display the nir light curves of q0957 + 561b in fig .",
    "this includes 50 data points at @xmath6 = 7481   ( @xmath5-band ) and 45 data points at @xmath6 = 8931   ( @xmath0-band ) .",
    "while the @xmath5-band flux accuracy is 1.4% , the @xmath0-band flux accuracy is only 2.0% .",
    "1b includes all nuv - optical - nir records of q0957 + 561b in 2010 .    as a result of the cosmic expansion , observed wavelengths ( @xmath6 ) are longer than emission wavelengths at the agn ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "hence , our nuv - optical [ 3 ] and nir light curves of q0957 + 561b in 2010 correspond to uv continuum sources at @xmath0 = 1.41 ( emission at @xmath7 = 14383706  ) . in our recent paper [ 3 ] , we have only analysed the best data from each telescope .",
    "this approach precluded the use of nir data , since the photometric accuracy and time coverage in the @xmath8 bands are worse than those in the @xmath9 bands . here , using a @xmath10 minimization ( e.g. , [ 4 ] ) , the nir light curves are compared to the @xmath11-band brightness record ( @xmath7 = 1944  ) .",
    "we thus estimate two additional relative delays for emissions at @xmath7 = 3104   ( @xmath5-band ) and @xmath7 = 3706   ( @xmath0-band ) : @xmath12(3104",
    " ) - @xmath12(1944  ) = 9.0@xmath13 days and @xmath12(3706  ) - @xmath12(1944  ) = 14.0@xmath14 days ( 1@xmath15 intervals ) , which are used to check the inner accretion onto the supermassive black hole .",
    "these new delays confirm the scenario derived from the previous interband delays [ 3 ] , i.e. , all measured delays are consistent with observer - frame lags @xmath16 between a central irradiating source and standard disk rings emitting at different wavelengths @xmath7 ( e.g. , [ 6 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the normalization based on nuv - optical data , @xmath12(1944  ) = 9 days , also works at @xmath7 = 30004000    ( see fig .",
    "the uv continuum sources ( @xmath7 = 14383706  ) lie within 1030 @xmath17 of the central black hole , where @xmath17 is the schwarzschild radius for a black hole mass @xmath18 [ 7 ] .",
    "if the irradiating source is just above the black hole , the disk temperature at radius @xmath19 is given by ( e.g. , [ 6 ] ) @xmath20^{1/4 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , @xmath22 is the gravitation constant , @xmath15 is the stefan constant , @xmath23 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath24 is the irradiation - to - viscosity ratio , @xmath25 is the disk albedo , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the luminosity and height of the central irradiating source .",
    "each central flare propagates out at the speed of light @xmath28 and arrives at radius @xmath29 after an observer - frame time @xmath30 .",
    "the temperature then rises and the peak emissivity increases , so each flare is reprocessed to roughly produce a fluctuation at @xmath31 $ ] ( black - body emission peak ) , @xmath32 and @xmath33 being the boltzmann constant and the planck constant , respectively [ 6 ] . the expected @xmath34 relationship is @xmath35^{1/3 } \\left(\\frac{k \\lambda}{hc}\\right)^{4/3 } , \\ ] ] and we compare this eq .",
    "( 3 ) to the observed law @xmath36 .",
    "we obtain an effective mass accretion rate @xmath37 = 3 @xmath38 yr@xmath39 that translates into two extreme accretion - irradiation regimes :    \\(a ) @xmath23 = 3 @xmath38 yr@xmath39 and @xmath40 10@xmath41 erg s@xmath39 , and ( b ) @xmath23 = 1 @xmath38 yr@xmath39 and @xmath26 = 10@xmath42 erg s@xmath39 ,    assuming the reasonable constraints @xmath43 = 1 and @xmath44 1 @xmath38 yr@xmath39 [ 8 ] .",
    "3 shows some radial profiles for the black hole mass and effective mass accretion rate of q0957 + 561 .",
    "if central flares are thermally reprocessed in the disk at 1030 @xmath17 from the central supermassive black hole , what is the source of such flares ?",
    "standard simulations of x - ray reprocessing ( e.g. , [ 9 ] ) ruled out the possibility that the disk variability is driven by a standard corona just above the black hole .",
    "the power - law x - ray emission is plausibly originated in the base of the q0957 + 561 jet at a typical height of 200 @xmath17 [ 3 ] .",
    "moreover , the thermal source that we detect in the chandra x - ray spectra ( @xmath45 = 0.08 kev ) can not account for the observed nuv - optical - nir variations .",
    "a central euv ( unobservable ! ) source seems the best candidate to illuminate the disk and drive its variability .",
    "while standard reprocessing simulations rely on the lamppost model and use observed high - energy variations to try to reproduce observed fluctuations at lower energies ( presumably originated in accretion disks ; e.g. , [ 9 , 3 ] and the last paper in [ 2 ] ) , low - energy ( @xmath6 = 300010000  ) brightness records and inverse problem techniques ( e.g. , [ 10 ] ) can be powerful tools for reconstructing emissivities of central irradiating sources .",
    "the so - called inverse problem in reprocessing has a very promising future , and here we concentrate on direct reconstructions of the central variable ( effective ) luminosity of q0957 + 561 based on our nuv - optical - nir data in 2010 .",
    "the standard accretion disk is illuminated by an isotropic source of luminosity @xmath26 that is located at a height @xmath27 above the central supermassive black hole ( lamppost model ) .",
    "a distant observer is situated at latitude @xmath46 . ]",
    "a fraction @xmath47 of the illuminating euv radiation would be absorbed in the disk , and then reprocessed into thermal radiation .",
    "this variable illumination would cause the variable emission of the disk . considering the lamppost model and an observer at latitude @xmath46 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , the contribution of the disk portion @xmath48 at ( @xmath49 ) to the flux received at time @xmath50 by the distant observer is related to the luminosity of the central source at time @xmath51 , where @xmath52/c$ ] . as a result ,",
    "the expected flux from the whole disk @xmath53 depends on different central luminosities @xmath54 at different lags @xmath12 with respect to the emission time @xmath55 .",
    "a simple approach consists of assuming an effective luminosity @xmath56 responsible for the disk emission by irradiation , which would correspond to an effective lag @xmath57 . for each observation epoch @xmath50",
    ", one can minimize the difference between the modeled and observed flux : @xmath58 , and thus obtain the value of @xmath56 for the data point at @xmath50 .",
    "we take @xmath59 and @xmath0 = 1.41 , as well as a typical latitude @xmath46 = 45@xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath25 = 1/4 .",
    "note that the values of @xmath27 and @xmath25 verify the constraint @xmath43 = 1 ( see above ) .",
    "it is not so easy to set a reasonable value of the agn - observer transmission factor @xmath62 .",
    "this is a combination of two different contributions : the gravitational lens magnification ( @xmath63 1 ) and the dust extinction ( @xmath64 1 ) of q0957 + 561b .",
    "we somewhat arbitrarily assume that both effects compensate each other , so that @xmath65 = 1 .",
    "first , we check the two extreme mass accretion rates that we find from the time delay analysis in section 2 , i.e. , ( a ) @xmath23 = 3 @xmath38 yr@xmath39 and ( b ) @xmath23 = 1 @xmath38 yr@xmath39 . both extreme values",
    "lead to luminosities exceeding 10@xmath42 erg s@xmath39 , in reasonable agreement with expected emissivities in the accretion - irradiation regime ( b ) .",
    "second , we select the self - consistent regime ( b ) , and set @xmath23 = 1 @xmath38 yr@xmath39 .",
    "we infer effective luminosities of a few 10@xmath42 erg s@xmath39 from the nuv - optical - nir records ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "the effective luminosity curves are smoothed versions of the actual luminosity curve . thus , the variability from the swift / uvot data ( @xmath3 band ) is more realistic than those from the optical - nir fluxes , since the @xmath3-band source is relatively small and the smoothing is not so important .",
    "we also remark that the luminosity offsets between the @xmath66-based reconstructions are plausibly due to wavelength - dependent dust extinction in the host galaxy , the lensing galaxy and the milky way .",
    "this produces a chromatic @xmath65 , which has not been taken into account in our calculations .",
    "in addition , the ordering of our reconstructions is the expected arrangement for an unrealistic achromatic extinction .",
    "a recent multiwavelengtht monitoring of a sharp fluctuation in the trailing image of the gravitationally lensed radio - loud quasar q0957 + 561 allows us to dicuss the accretion physics in the vicinity of a distant supermassive black hole at @xmath0 = 1.41 .",
    "there is evidence for an irradiated ( standard ) accretion disk around the black hole , where the disk heating is mostly generated from irradiation by a central source .",
    "this central irradiating source very likely emits euv photons and produces luminosities @xmath67 10@xmath42 erg s@xmath39 .",
    "our data also support the presence of an euv luminosity variation of about 100% on a relatively short source - frame timescale of 40 days .",
    "the authors thank harvey tananbaum and neil gehrels for granting director s discretionary time for the chandra and swift observations , respectively .",
    "we also thank the operations group of the liverpool telescope ( robert smith and jon marchant ) for their kind interaction and support during our ground - based monitoring projects .",
