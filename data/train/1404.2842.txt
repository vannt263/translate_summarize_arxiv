    "cloud computing has become a promising choice for modern computing platforms and will most likely continue to be the dominant service model in the future .",
    "the foundation of cloud computing is founded by taking advantage of virtualization technologies such as vmware @xcite and xen @xcite to encapsulate applications into virtual machines ( vms ) and allow independent applications to execute on the same physical server simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , cloud computing affords users to obtain , configure , and deploy cloud services themselves using cloud service catalogues , without requiring the assistance of it ( infrastructure technology ) @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of vm consolidation and on - demand resource allocation offers an opportunity for cloud operators to multiplex resources among users and thus improve the operational cost , e.g. , reducing the energy consumption .",
    "however , although it brings better utilization to the cloud system , such kind of resource multiplexing is not always beneficial .",
    "when vms are consolidated together , the performance interference between the vms brought by the contention of shared resources such as last - level - cache , memory bus , network and disk bandwidth can not be ignored @xcite . as compared to running in a dedicated server",
    ", a vm has to compete on the shared resources with other vms that collocated with it and thus the performance will be degraded even with the same resource reservation . while previous work is focused on analysis on application - level interference in single servers , we aim to study the assignment and scheduling of vms to physical servers , mitigating the performance interference while optimizing the operational cost .",
    "we tackle this combinatorial problem of joint optimization by leveraging the specific structures of vm collocation .",
    "it is necessary to provide efficient management of performance interference in order to guarantee the quality of service for tenants in a cloud data center . in general",
    ", the performance interference between vms can be affected by the following two factors .    * vm combination . *",
    "recent researches have analysed the resource contention for possible vm combinations and suggested to collocate those vms that have less competition between shared resources @xcite . in order to quantify the overall performance interference between collocated vms",
    ", we evaluated the performance degradation of vms using speccpu 2006 benchmark @xcite where we assume each application executes in a virtual machine and runs on a physical core .",
    "we define the _ performance degradation ratio _ ( pdr ) of a vm as the increment of running time divided by the time used for the vm to be executed in a dedicated server .",
    "the statistical results are demonstrated in table  [ tb : spatial ] . as can be seen from the table ,",
    "the pdr of @xmath0 when being collocated with @xmath1 is @xmath2 while it is @xmath3 when being collocated with @xmath4 .",
    "this reveals that different vm combinations lead to variable level of performance interference . as a result",
    ", vm placement can be done in an intelligent way such that the performance interference between vms is minimized .",
    "another observation is that the pdrs of vms become larger with the increase of number of collocated vms .",
    "for example , in table  [ tb : spatial ] , the pdrs of @xmath1 and @xmath4 are @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , while these values increase up to @xmath7 and @xmath8 when a third vm for @xmath0 is launched simultaneously on the same physical server .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * impact of workload density : * we compare the proposed algorithms on five data sets : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 vms , and in each of them the arrival time of vms is generated from the same range @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "i.e. , the number of data set from @xmath9 to @xmath13 represents the increment of workload density . the degradation factor between vms",
    "is also generated from the normal distribution @xmath15 @xmath16 if @xmath17 .",
    "[ fig : eva_perf_density ] presents the results . in all simulations with different intensity",
    ", the minimum total cost is achieved by mdc due to its more global view . moreover ,",
    "the improvement margin is stable with the increment of workload density .",
    "mic and mdc perform better in more intensive load .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the other four algorithms would lead to more performance degradation when they do not take into account the performance interference in heavy load .",
    "impact of different workload density.,width=345 ]        * impact of weight of performance degradation penalty : * as mentioned in the optimization model of section  [ sec : model]-c , the weight @xmath18 is some constant incorporating the normalization and the relative importance of the performance degradation penalty . our virtual machine scheduling exploits this weight , and now we study the impact of this weight on the performance of the proposed algorithms . in this simulation , we focus on four metrics : total cost , worst performance degradation factor , the number of servers to be used and makespan . the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : eva_perf_weight ] . the first observation from the fig .",
    "[ fig : eva_perf_weight ] is that as the weight increases , the results of worst performance degradation factor , the number of servers to be used and makespan mainly stay the same in bpv , rand , rr and mie .",
    "this is because the scheduling of these four algorithms is not influenced by the weight .",
    "the results of their total cost increase only because the weight @xmath18 grows .",
    "another remark is that the worst performance degradation factor reduces quickly in mic and mdc when the weight surpasses a certain value ( in our simulation , e.g. , @xmath19 ) .",
    "however , the number of servers to be used increases a little when we give more weight to performance degradation penalty , which leads to makespan metric reduction .",
    "obviously , the improvement of total cost in mic and mdc getting more with an increment of the weight .",
    "we finally present the simulation on our online algorithms in the dynamic environment .",
    "it should be noted that the aforementioned algorithms except mdc can be transformed to the online versions , so the corresponding results are also held .",
    "we focus on evaluating the performance of _ algorithm .",
    "[ algo : ivp_algorithm ] _ which incorporates the vm batch arrival and vm reservation . in this simulation , we fix the total number of vms and their performance degradation factors .",
    "we adopt different sizes of vms to be revealed at each scheduling time to represent the vms with batch arrival and reservation .",
    "there are @xmath20 vms revealed at each scheduling time if the size is @xmath20 .",
    "for example , it corresponds to one by one scheduling when the size is 1 ( like omic ) , and there are 10 vms revealed at each scheduling time when the size is 10 .",
    "we run the algorithm with five randomly generated instances ( 1#5 # ) and one sequentially generated instance ( 6 # ) on each size .",
    "the result is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : eva_perf_online ] .",
    "as we can see the performance is better with the the number of size increases , i.e. , more information about vms are revealed due to batch arrival and reservation .",
    "in addition , the total cost have a much improvement from the number of size 1 to 2 . in summary , the _ algorithm .",
    "[ algo : ivp_algorithm ] _ exploits the properties of vms scheduling in cloud data centers and obtains a better improvement of the total cost than omic algorithm which do not consider these properties .",
    "total cost of different size @xmath20 of vms to be revealed at each scheduling time.,width=345 ]",
    "in this paper , we present virtual machine scheduling for arbitrating between operational cost and performance interference in cloud data centers . while previous works only provide energy consumption management or performance interference optimization separately , we are among the first to build a joint model to capture the inherent tradeoff between the two contradictory objectives .",
    "we also develop efficient scheduling algorithms for both offline and online cases and improve them by exploiting some properties in clouds such as resource reservation .",
    "we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms by a comprehensive set of simulations .",
    "our results confirm that a joint optimization that takes into account both vm combination and life - cycle overlapping can significantly reduce the operational cost , as well as the performance interference in cloud data centers .",
