    "the basic significance and possible importance of qcd - instanton effects in deep inelastic scattering for decreasing bjorken variable @xmath1 and high photon virtuality @xmath2 has recently been emphasized @xcite .",

    "this is rooted in the fact that @xmath3 plays the rle of a dynamical infrared cut - off for the instanton size @xcite .",

    "the anomalous @xmath0 violation due to electroweak instantons is paralleled by a chirality violation induced by qcd - instantons @xcite .",

    "the present paper represents a first status report on a broad and systematic study of possible manifestations of qcd - instantons which could be searched for at hera @xcite . while a theoretical derivation of crucial quantities characterizing the instanton - induced final state ( @xmath6 particle inclusive rates , average multiplicity , average transverse momenta , energy flow , etc . ) will be deferred to ref .",

    "isotropically_. we may imagine a `` fireball '' in @xmath164-wave configuration , decaying into gluons and at least @xmath165 quarks , including _ strangeness _  ( ! ) and possibly charm , if kinematically allowed ( c.f .",
    "[ f5 ] ) .    _",
    "ii ) dependence on @xmath166 _ : the @xmath34-subprocess cross sections @xmath167 are expected to strongly decrease with increasing @xmath168 for fixed @xmath169 and to strongly increase with decreasing @xmath169 for fixed @xmath168 ( c.f . sect .  2 ) .",
    "as discussed above and in sect .",
    "3 , it remains uncertain , however , how long the cross sections continue to increase towards @xmath170 .",
    "_ iii ) multiplicity _ : the total multiplicity associated with the @xmath34-subprocess is expected to be large , @xmath171 on the parton level , leading typically to @xmath172 particles after hadronization . in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , we display @xmath173 as calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at small values of @xmath169 and large @xmath168 ,",
    "the multiplicity obtains a large contribution from gluons and peaks around @xmath174 , whereas at large @xmath169 the @xmath175 produced quarks dominate .",
    "the peaking of the gluon multiplicity at small , non - vanishing @xmath169 actually has an appealing interpretation :    for large values of @xmath168 the coefficient of @xmath176 in eq .",
    "( [ nav ] ) turns out to be @xcite @xmath177 , involving the derivative of the valley action with respect to the conformal parameter @xmath105 , taken at the saddle point value @xmath178 ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) . as discussed in sect .  3",
    ", the full valley action smoothly interpolates between a non - interacting , infinitely separated instanton / anti - instanton pair for @xmath179 ( probed for @xmath180 ) and the perturbative vacuum for @xmath181 ( probed for @xmath170 ) .",
    "hence , in both limits a _ decrease _ of the gluon multiplicity matches well the intuition !",
    "the peak of the multiplicity inbetween corresponds to the maximal variation of the action with @xmath105 .",
    "we also note the substantial increase of the gluon multiplicity with increasing @xmath168 , which at large @xmath168 mainly reflects the running of @xmath182 in eq .",
    "( [ nav ] ) .    _",
    "iv ) @xmath183 signature _ : the transverse momenta of the partons emerging from the instanton subprocess and the one of the current - quark jet ( c.f . fig",
    ".  [ f5 ] ) are expected to be `` semi hard '' , typically of order @xcite @xmath184     given this plausible generic input _",
    "i ) - iv ) _ , we may now ask , how instanton - induced events would look like in the h1/zeus detectors .",
    "first of all , we observe that as a direct consequence of the _ isotropy _ assumption _ i ) _ , the ( pseudo ) rapidity distribution of a single final state parton in the @xmath34-c.m .",
    "system takes the form @xmath185 i.e. it is strongly peaked in ( pseudo ) rapidity @xmath186 around @xmath187 with a half width of @xmath188 the shape and width of the distribution in pseudo rapidity remains , of course , very similar in the hera laboratory system , for kinematical configurations where the @xmath34-c.m .",
    "system is dominantly boosted longitudinally .",
    "depending on the values of the various subprocess variables , the peak position ( @xmath187 ) fluctuates in general over the available range of @xmath189 ( for given @xmath1 and @xmath190 viz .",
    "@xmath2 ) : @xmath191\\right ) .",
    "\\label{etalab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in analogy to the standard @xmath190 variable , we have introduced in eq .",
    "( [ etalab ] ) the @xmath192 momentum fraction @xmath193 the variable @xmath194 denotes the azimuthal angle of the vector @xmath195 in the hera laboratory frame . due to momentum conservation , @xmath196 , the component of the current - quark momentum out of the @xmath197 scattering plane .    in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , the dominant matrix element and ( @xmath198)-plot of a typical instanton - induced event is contrasted with the canonical two - jet configuration in perturbative qcd .    clearly , the `` 0th level '' signature to watch out for is a densely populated hadronic `` band '' in the @xmath199-plane , centered at a fluctuating value ( [ etalab ] ) of @xmath200 .",
    "this striking multi - hadron final state originates from @xmath201 `` semi - hard '' jets ( c.f .",
    "[ f6 ] ) , always includes strangeness and is characterized by a width @xmath202 .",
    "let us point out two observables , which  on an event - by - event basis ",
    "appear to be particularly sensitive to this event structure .    * _ the ( transverse ) energy flow _ , @xmath203 ( integrated over @xmath204 ) , will exhibit a strong enhancement at the position @xmath205 of the `` band '' , since each of the @xmath201 instanton - induced jets contributes a comparable energy into a single @xmath189 bin of width @xmath206 .",
    "if , in addition , the current - quark jet is isolated from the `` band '' ( see below ) , one even expects a double - peak structure in @xmath203 .",
    "the energy flow signature may well be less affected by hadronization than patterns associated with individual tracks . *",
    "_ pseudo sphericity _ : the usual event - shape variables like sphericity and aplanarity should be useful tools in analysing the manifestations of an isotropic instanton - induced subprocess in the final state .",
    "of particular sensitivity appears the so - called pseudo sphericity @xcite , which incorporates only transverse information from the event in terms of the azimuthal angles @xmath207 of the",
    "n final state hadrons : @xmath208 apparently , it equals to 1 in the c.m .",
    "system of an isotropical event and vanishes for a single `` collimated '' jet .    as a next level of sophistication , we study the effects of kinematical cuts on suitable final - state variables with the aim , to further enhance the event topology and to unfold and/or restrict the @xmath34-subprocess variables @xmath209",
    "of course , this has to be achieved    * without affecting significantly the expected size of the @xmath34-subprocess cross section @xmath210 ( by exploring input _ ii ) _ above ) ; * such that the @xmath34-subprocess is invoked in a kinematical region of ( @xmath211 ) , where it induces a high average multiplicity @xmath212 according to fig .",
    "[ f6 ] .",
    "the key aspect is to focus on an event topology corresponding to an _ isolated _ ( semi - hard ) current - quark jet ( c.f .",
    "iv ) _ above : @xmath213 ) _ in addition to _ a hadronic `` band '' in ( @xmath198 ) as discussed in `` level 0 '' above . to this end , let us consider the constraints on the ( internal ) subprocess variables @xmath214 , implied by the following reasonable separation criteria :    * the hadronic `` band '' should be contained in the ( central ) detector , such that its peak position satisfies @xmath215 , say ( in practice , this upper bound for @xmath200 may well be pushed up to @xmath216 ) . *",
    "the current - quark jet is required to be separated in @xmath189 from the hadronic `` band '' ( centered around @xmath200 ) by @xmath217 * a minimal transverse momentum , @xmath218 gev , is required for the current - quark jet .    in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] we have displayed the resulting restrictions on the internal subprocess variables @xmath219 , for a typical set of fixed `` external '' parameters @xmath220@xmath221@xmath84 . apparently , after imposing the isolation requirements for the current - quark jet we are left with two allowed , ` triangular ' regions 1 and 2 , in the ( @xmath222)-plane .",
    "the central portion of fig .",
    "[ f8 ] is excluded by the cut on @xmath223 ( solid lines ) , with the left- ( right- ) hand boundary corresponding to @xmath224 .",
    "the excluded portion on the left ( short dashes ) refers to the hadronic `` band '' being centered within @xmath225 , with @xmath226 located on the right .",
    "hence , if a value of @xmath200 _ above _ 1 is experimentally tolerable , the allowed region 1 increases significantly . finally , the main effect of the requirement @xmath227 gev , is to set a lower limit to the involved values of @xmath169 , and to exclude the region @xmath228 very close to 1 ( long dashes ) .",
    "these results demonstrate that , indeed , kinematical cuts of the type considered here , may well restrict the @xmath34-subprocess variables @xmath109 to regions where the computation @xcite of @xmath229 may be trusted ( e.g. within regime 2 of fig .  [ f8 ] ) .    according to our input _",
    "ii ) _ above and fig .",
    "[ f9 ] , regime 1 in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] will presumably be associated with considerably higher rates , since it typically corresponds to much smaller values of @xmath19 and @xmath169 than regime 2 . from fig .",
    "[ f9 ] we also infer a comfortably high total parton multiplicity @xmath230 in regime 1 , as well as an energy / parton @xmath231 gev in the @xmath34-c.m . system .",
    "let us finally illustrate in figs .",
    "[ f10 ] ,  [ f11 ] an event in the hera laboratory frame , corresponding both to a striking signature ( isolated current - quark jet along with a densely populated hadronic `` band '' ) and favourable rate / multiplicity conditions for the instanton subprocess .",
    "we note the corresponding event - shape variables ( on the parton level in the laboratory frame ) as calculated from the instanton - induced partons within the `` band '' @xmath232 of course , due to the isotropy of the instanton - induced subprocess , the sphericity , aplanarity and pseudo - sphericity variables essentially adopt their maximal values of 1 , 1/2 and 1 , respectively , in the @xmath34-c.m . frame .",
    "apparently , the pseudo sphericity is least affected by the lorentz transformation into the laboratory frame and continues to reflect the underlying isotropy .",
    "clearly , for a quantitative discussion , hadronization effects have to be included@xcite , which may well wash out somewhat the traces of the underlying isotropy in the various event shape parameters .",
    "the search for qcd - instanton induced events at hera is well worth the effort :    first of all , these `` anomalous '' processes are predicted to occur _ within standard qcd_. secondly , there is a close analogy to electroweak @xmath0 violating processes , as was discussed in detail in sect .  2 .",
    "while a promising search for anomalous electroweak events is only possible in the far future , the search for manifestations of qcd - instantons can start right now , in deep inelastic @xmath5 scattering at hera .    besides summarizing the essence and limitations of the theoretical calculations involved @xcite , we have presented in sect .  3 a state of the art evaluation of the instanton - induced contribution to the nucleon structure function @xmath79 .",
    "it rises strongly with decreasing @xmath1 and tends to reach the size of the experimental data around @xmath233 .",
    "unfortunately , due to inherent uncertainties , the calculation can not be trusted anymore for @xmath234 , say .",
    "nevertheless , the trend is very suggestive !",
    "however , enhancements of the inclusive leptoproduction rate at small @xmath1 are also expected from other competing mechanisms like `` ( perturbative ) reggeization '' . therefore ,",
    "the structure functions appear only of limited value in searches for `` footprints '' of qcd - instantons .    in section 4",
    "we have reported first phenomenological results of our ongoing broad and systematic investigation of the qcd - instanton induced _ hadronic final state _ @xcite . since",
    "a calculation of the `` splitting function ''  associated with the propagation of the current quark in the instanton background  is still in progress , a discussion of expected event rates has to be deferred to a later stage . in the present analysis we only made use of information abstracted from our calculation of the instanton - subprocess observables @xcite along with hera kinematics",
    "this was sufficient , however , to obtain important insight into the expected event topology in the most interesting regime of small @xmath1 .",
    "* the `` 0th level '' signature to watch out for is a densely populated hadronic `` band '' in the @xmath199-plane ( c.f .",
    "[ f7 ] ) , centered at some fluctuating value @xmath200 .",
    "this striking multi - hadron final state originates from @xmath201 `` semi - hard '' jets ( c.f .",
    "[ f6 ] ) , always includes strangeness and is characterized by a width @xmath202 .",
    "it directly reflects an underlying instanton - subprocess , associated with the formation of an @xmath164-wave `` fireball '' , which then decays isotropically into gluons and at least @xmath165 quarks .",
    "observables which are particularly sensitive to this event structure are e.g. the ( transverse ) energy flow and the so - called pseudo sphericity",
    ". the energy flow signature may well be less affected by hadronization than patterns associated with individual tracks . * as a next level of sophistication , we have studied kinematical cuts on suitable final - state variables , which help to further enhance the event topolology and to unfold and/or restrict the ( bjorken ) variables of the instanton subprocess within a theoretically controllable regime , despite small @xmath1 . along these lines",
    "one may hope to bridge the substantial gap between the kinematical region , where the instanton - subprocess cross sections may be theoretically estimated @xcite , and small @xmath1 values , @xmath146 , where the bulk of hera data is accumulating at present .    in summary ,",
    "experimental searches for instanton `` footprints '' in the multi - particle final state appear to be much more promising than searches via the structure functions .",
    "finally , let us briefly mention some related theoretical and phenomenological issues presently under study .",
    "theoretical work is in progress to improve the pre - exponential factors , affecting quite strongly the predictions for structure functions and the various subprocess cross sections .",
    "this refers in particular to a more reliable evaluation of the functional determinants @xcite in the instanton / anti - instanton valley background beyond the dilute instanton - gas approximation .    of great importance for further studies of qcd - instanton phenomenology",
    "is the task of establishing a convolution form @xcite of the @xmath85-parton multi - particle cross sections in terms of `` splitting functions '' and instanton - subprocess cross sections ( c.f .",
    "eq .  ( [ convolution ] ) )",
    ". once the `` splitting functions '' have been isolated and calculated , we hope to come forward with predictions for the rate of instanton - induced multi - particle events .",
    "we are then ready to study the instanton - induced multi - particle final state by means of a monte carlo based event generator @xcite . only after including effects of hadronization and background will it be possible to address the crucial question : how many `` anomalous '' events are needed to establish the `` discovery '' of an instanton at hera ?",
