    "in the paper we introduce the operation of weaving , which associates with a partial steiner triple system ( shortly : with a psts ) @xmath0 a  product \" @xmath1 of @xmath0 and a cyclic group of order @xmath2 in such a way that a quotient of @xmath1 wrt . to a congruence @xmath3",
    "is @xmath0 , and the coimage of a line of @xmath0 under natural projection @xmath4 is a generalization of the pappus configuration .",
    "clarly , these properties do not characterize the operation of weaving uniquely , and several constructions which have these properties can be found in the literature , just to mention the operation of convolution and the `` product '' defined in @xcite , of an sts with a parallel class distinguished and an abelian group .",
    "the notion of convolution was introduced in @xcite ( in a slightly less general way than this adopted in this paper ) , though it was used , implicitly , e.g. in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( comp .",
    "also @xcite ) . both in the construction of the convolution and the construction of @xmath2-th weaved configuration applied to a partial steiner triple system @xmath0 the constructed points are  weighted \" points of @xmath0 i.e. pairs of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a point of @xmath0 and @xmath7 is an element of a fixed ( in case of weaving ",
    "cyclic ) group @xmath8 .",
    "the lines are sets of triples of weighted points on lines of @xmath0 whose weights satisfy certain conditions .",
    "one can note an analogy between these constructions and the product construction .",
    "an analogy only , since the triples of weights on lines of the constructed configuration need not yield any psts defined on @xmath8 .",
    "it is worth to recall here one more construction of a similar kind : a `` product '' defined in @xcite of an sts with a parallel class distinguished and an abelian group . at the end of the paper",
    "we discuss the case when these constructions produce isomorphic configurations .",
    "examples of classical configurations that are convolutions were already quoted in @xcite , these are e.g. the veblen configuration ( also called _ the pasch configuration _ ) , the reye configuration , the pappus configuration . some of them are also weaved configurations . some of them are also members of another family , family of configurations presentable as cyclically inscribed triangles - configurations . ]",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we do not study this family on its own but its members play an important role in characterizations of weaved configurations ( cf .",
    "[ prop : bezpap ] and its consequences ) .",
    "the pappus configuration is an important example of a configuration which is in each of these three families .",
    "we start with establishing general properties of weaved configurations .",
    "the operation of weaving destroys most of classical configurations based on the veblen configuration ; in particular it gives desargues - free ( prop . [ prop : des ] ) and fano - free ( prop .",

    "[ rem : antypasz ] ) .",
    "still , geometry of an @xmath2-th weaved configuration is relatively easy to understand .",
    "in particular , it is easy to determine the triangles and cliques in it ( lem . [ lem : triangles ] ) , to characterize some characteristic subconfigurations ( being direct generalizations of the pappus configuration , prop .",
    "[ prop : pseudopapy ] , the proof of [ prop : bezpap ] ) , and to characterize ( for @xmath9 ) its automorphism group ( thm .",
    "[ thm : autpol ] ) .",
    "after proving general properties of weaving operation , in the last section we show some applications of the obtained results . on other hand",
    ", the pappus configuration has the unique line - complement to an sts , which is the famous affine plane @xmath10 .",
    "and an affine space @xmath11 is one of the classical examples of a pasch - free sts ( i.e. an sts that does not contain any veblen subconfiguration ) .",

    "each line of the resulting configuration can be extended to an affine ( sub)plane , and planes are their maximal subspaces which are affine .",
