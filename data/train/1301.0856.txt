    "magnetism plays an important role in the lives of stars , frequently in the form of its influence on angular momentum transport for star formation and evolution ( e.g. , ghosh & lamb 1979 ; blandford & payne 1982 ; bodenheimer 1995 ; mckee & ostriker 2007 ; meynet , eggenberger , & maeder 2011 ; matt  2012 ) , and also in terms of hot plasma generation ( e.g. , davidson & ostriker 1973 ; babel & montemerle 1997ab ; townsend , owocki , & ud - doula 2007 ; li 2008 ; gdel & naz 2009 ) . of interest to this paper is the growing body of evidence for magnetism among massive stars .",
    "direct detections of magnetism in normal stars ( i.e. , not compact objects ) are in large part relegated to measuring circular polarizations in spectral lines arising from the zeeman effect ( see donati & landstreet 2009 ) .",
    "the first detection of magnetism in a star besides the sun dates back to babcock ( 1947 ) .",
    "since then , the field has exploded .",
    "a recent review of the current state of the subject for non - degenerate stars can be found in donati & landstreet ( 2009 ) .",
    "the key result now is that whereas magnetic detections were mainly limited to stars with surface fields in the kilo - gauss range , modern instrumentation and diagnostic strategies regularly achieve highly significant detections in the regime of 100 s of gauss ( e.g. , donati & collier cameron 1997 ) , and in some special cases much less ( e.g. , sennhauser & berdyugina 2011 ) .    numerous direct detections of surface magnetism in massive stars have been reported , with some recent examples being alecian  ( 2011 ) , petit  ( 2011 ) , schller  ( 2011 ) , hubrig  ( 2011 , 2012 ) grunhut  ( 2012a , 2012b , 2012c ) , wade  ( 2011 ; 2012 ) .",
    "these successes have correspondingly motivated theoretical studies to understand the origin of these fields for massive stars ( e.g. , macgregor & cassinelli 2003 ; braithwaite 2006 ; cantiello  2009 ) , their influence on massive star evolution ( maeder & meynet 2003 ; yoon , dierks , & langer 2012 ) , and connection to other observational phenomena such as x - ray emissions ( babel & montmerle 1997b ; gagne  1997 ; gagne  2005 ; favata  2009 ; ignace  2010 ; oskinova  2011 ; gagne  2011 ; wade  2012 ; grunhut  2012 ; ignace , oskinova , & massa 2012 ) and aspherical wind flow ( poe , friend , & cassinelli 1989 ; shore & brown 1990 ; chevalier & luo 1994 ; ud - doula & owocki 2002 ; townsend & owocki 2005 ; brown , cassinelli , & maheswaran 2008 ; ud - doula , owocki , & townsend 2008 ; ud - doula  2012 ) .",
    "there are other diagnostics of stellar magnetism that have or could complement the zeeman - based approach .",
    "non - thermal radio emissions from massive star colliding wind binaries have been used to infer stellar magnetism ( e.g. , williams  1997 ; dougherty & williams 2000 ; de becker  2006 ; van loo , runacres , & blomme 2006 ) .",
    "the hanle effect is a weak zeeman effect pertaining to the influence of magnetic fields on the linear polarization in spectral lines .",
    "the effect is sensitive to magnetic fields in the 1100  g range ( depending on the einstein a - value of the lines being measured ) and has been successfully used in studies of solar magnetism for decades ( e.g. , sahal - brechot , bommier , & leroy 1977 ; stenflo 1982 ; berdyugina & fluri 2004 ; trujillo bueno  2005 ) .",
    "there is a small but growing literature on its potential application to other stars ( ignace , nordsieck , & cassinelli 1997 ; lopez ariste , asensio ramos , gonzalez fernandez 2011 ; ignace  2011 ; bommier 2012 ; manso sainz & martinez gonzalez 2012 ) .",
    "another important method for measuring astrophysical magnetic fields is faraday rotation .",
    "the effect refers to how the line - of - sight ( los ) magnetic field component rotates the position angle of linear polarization for a beam of radiation .",
    "the amount of rotation is also proportional both to the electron density ( hence operates only in a plasma ) and to the path length through such regions .",
    "importantly , the amount of position angle ( pa ) rotation scales with the square of the wavelength of observation , @xmath0 . in this way most applications measure the polarization pa for a range of wavelengths to derive a quantity called the `` rotation measure '' ( or rm ; see the following section ) that encodes information about the integrated product of the los field component and electron number density .",
    "most applications of faraday rotation are for interstellar or extragalactic studies .",
    "space precludes a comprehensive review of this literature ; discussion of the state of the field , with references therein , can be found for example in carilli & taylor ( 2002 ) , han  ( 2006 ) , and beck ( 2012 ) . here",
    "attention is focused on the potential of faraday rotation as a probe of stellar magnetism in wind - blown bubbles .",
    "there has been several recent observational developments that speak to the interaction of stellar winds or supernova explosions with the surrounding interstellar environment and the capacity of probing these interactions with faraday rotation .",
    "ransom  ( 2008 , 2010 ) have conducted studies of faraday rotation effects arising from planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "the relative motion between a pn and the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) alters the strength and direction of the interstellar magnetic field , leading to variations of the polarization pa across the pne and the trailing tail it creates in relation to the pas surrounding the structure . although implicitly placing constraints on the stellar magnetic field interior to the nebula , the pne act essentially as perturbers , on the scale of a few parsecs , of the local medium , with faraday rotation serving as a probe of the resultant disturbances .    regarding massive star influences , savage , spangler , & fischer ( 2012 ) report on an extensive study of faraday rotation for the hii region , the rosette nebula .",
    "in this application a cluster of massive stars lead to a wind - blown bubble and surrounding photoionized region by the central ob stars .",
    "in contrast to the pn studies of ransom  ( 2008 , 2010 ) , whose analysis was based on pa maps with the diffuse galactic synchrotron used as a source of linearly polarized radiation , the rosette study of savage  analyzed data from an array of sightlines to background extragalactic sources of polarized emission that intercept the nebula and surrounding region .",
    "their data are consistent with pa changes across the nebula , on a scale of @xmath1  pcs , arising from the presence of the bubble and its impact on the interstellar magnetic field .    for the case of faraday rotation as a probe of stellar magnetism , harvey - smith  ( 2010 )",
    "discuss an antisymmetric rm morphology across the supernova remnant ( snr ) g296.5 + 10.0 .",
    "the snr nebula has two prominent emission arcs on opposite sides of a symmetry axis , yet the pa rotations of either arc are oppositely oriented .",
    "this kind of pattern would be expected from a magnetic field that reverses its los polarity from one arc to the other .",
    "the authors associated the pattern with the magnetic field of a slow magnetized red supergiant wind .",
    "the ejecta shell from the sn has `` swept up '' the supergiant wind into the observed shell . to reproduce the rm pattern ,",
    "the stellar magnetic field would have to be toroidal to produce the observed polarity change between the emission arcs .",
    "the authors derive an expression to relate the observed scale of pa rotations to properties of the shell and the stellar wind . the observed change in amplitude of the rm by approximately 40",
    "rad / m@xmath2 indicates that a surface stellar magnetic field on the order of 500  g could account for the observations .    in this paper",
    "we explore further the idea of faraday rotation as a means of deriving information about stellar magnetism in the large - scale wind that might sometimes be observed in wind - blown bubbles and snrs . in section  [ sec : model ] , a brief review of the expressions describing faraday rotation are given . a derivation of pa rotation maps for an ionized and spherical stellar wind with azimuthal ( or toroidal ) magnetic fields",
    "is presented in section  [ sub : azi ] .",
    "pa rotation maps for a split monopole are presented in section  [ sub : split ] as a contrast case .",
    "returning to the azimuthal field in section  [ sub : swept ] , simple insertion of a spherical subvolume taken to have no magnetic field is used to simulate a two - wind interaction like that of a snr or any scenario in which a fast flow overtakes a slower one from an earlier stage of stellar evolution . in section  [ sec : disc ]",
    "applications of our results are discussed , with concluding remarks given in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the standard expression to represent the polarization pa rotation , @xmath3 , arising from faraday rotation along a sightline is    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the orientation of a background polarization upon which faraday rotation operates , and rm is the `` rotation measure '' given by the path length integral of    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the los component of the magnetic field , @xmath8 is the electron density , and path length .",
    "the rationale for this particular formulation is that observers are frequently interested in deriving rm from the radio data as a constraint on the magnetic field strength ( modulo the electron density , whose value may be constrained from other considerations ) .",
    "one measures values of @xmath3 for a range of wavelengths ; plotting @xmath3 against @xmath0 in a log - log plot should then yield a straight line whose slope is the rotation measure , rm . if @xmath9 , then the net faraday rotation from all of the parallel field components along the los , some being positive and some being negative , in regions where there are electrons has resulted in a counter - clockwise rotation of the background linearly polarized radiation . if @xmath10 , the net effect is a clockwise rotation .",
    "the sign of @xmath3 , or alternatively rm , is sensitive to the electron - density averaged net los field component along a given sightline .",
    "the distinction being drawn here is that our models emphasize _ differential _ faraday rotation ( e.g. , minter & spangler 1996 ) .",
    "this amounts to a map of how rm varies between neighboring sightlines , which is equivalent to analyzing maps of @xmath3 at a fixed wavelength .",
    "consequently , it is convenient for our purposes to reformulate the effect of faraday rotation as :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are chosen normalizations , @xmath14 is a relevant length scale for the problem , @xmath15 is in the same units of @xmath16 , and the factor of @xmath17 is made explicit here both to indicate that @xmath3 is measured in radians and to highlight the fact that polarization pa is degenerate in multiples of @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to convert such a map in pa to one in rm .",
    "if one evaluates @xmath19 at a reference wavelength @xmath20 , then    @xmath21    and so    @xmath22    the following discussion of faraday rotation in stellar bubbles adopts the use of equation  ( [ eq : psimap ] ) .",
    "we focus on three illustrative cases to highlight expected pa map morphologies as motivated by current observations .",
    "first the case of an azimuthal field distribution is considered .",
    "since the field strength diminishes only as @xmath23 , it is this component that is most likely to have observational relevance at the 110 parsec scales of stellar bubbles .",
    "second , as a contrast case , pa maps are derived for a split monopole field .",
    "this case leads to results that are morphologically distinct from the azimuthal field case .",
    "the field drops much faster with distance from the star , as @xmath24 , making this case essentially unobservable ; still , the split monopole has value in providing insight into the range of morphological possibilities .",
    "finally , we consider again the azimuthal field scenario but now imposing a central `` cavity '' that does not contribute to faraday rotation ( e.g. , a central region devoid of a magnetic field ) .",
    "this approximates a `` swept up '' field from a wind - wind interaction , such as may occur for a snr or a pn , where only the wind from an earlier phase of stellar evolution has a relevant magnetic field .",
    "we stress that spherical symmetry is adopted for the bubble shape and density distribution .",
    "it is not the goal of this paper to reproduce the observations for any particular object .",
    "a spherically symmetric density profile provides a `` controlled '' environment for which to evaluate and gain insight into faraday rotation through stellar bubbles .",
    "real situations may involve a broad range of additional ( and potentially important ) considerations , such as : aspherical density distributions ( e.g. , bipolar flows or clumping ) ; radius - dependent and/or aspherical ionization effects ; correlated behavior between density , ionization , and/or a dynamically relevant magnetic field ( e.g. , how a toroidal field can lead to axisymmetric bubbles as described in chevalier & luo 1994 ) .",
    "our spherical results provide a suite of baseline cases that are analytic or semi - analytic in which one can evaluate modifications to predicted pa maps arising from these more complex factors .    before proceeding",
    "it is useful first to review the different contributing components to faraday rotation that affect the final observed pa at the earth .",
    "the underlying assumption is that faraday rotation acts to rotate the pa of linearly polarized radiation as it passes through magnetized and ionized regions .",
    "the background source ( whether a point source or diffuse synchrotron background ) has some initial position angle @xmath25 .",
    "this value receives an additional contribution @xmath26 owing to the ism .",
    "the total pa measured at the earth is then    @xmath27    where both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are independent quantities that can vary from one sightline to the next .",
    "now for sightlines that intersect a stellar bubble , one must _ subtract _ the ism contribution for that segment of the sightline passing through the bubble , which we signify as @xmath28 .",
    "then the contribution made by the bubble , @xmath29 , must then be _",
    "the total pa at the earth now becomes :    @xmath30    the calculations in the following sections present maps specifically of @xmath31 .",
    "section  [ sec : disc ] deals with the fact that the bubble contribution alone is not what is actually measured .",
    "modeling the pa morphologies of stellar bubbles requires the introduction of two coordinate systems : the observer system and the stellar one . for the observer cartesian ,",
    "cylindrical , and spherical coordinates are adopted as @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , where the origin is the bubble center .",
    "here @xmath35 is the observer axis , with the earth at @xmath36 .",
    "the angle @xmath37 is measured counter - clockwise about this @xmath35-axis .",
    "then @xmath38 is the polar angle from the observer axis . as we will be discussing sightlines intersecting the stellar bubble",
    ", the cylindrical radius @xmath39 will be the impact parameter for such rays . for the star the corresponding cartesian and spherical coordinates are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    for the transformation between these coordinates",
    ", we choose @xmath42 . using unit vectors , the viewing inclination angle @xmath43 between the @xmath35 and @xmath44 axes",
    "is given by    @xmath45    transformations between the angular quantities can be obtained with spherical trigonometric relations , that will be used as needed .    in this first example ,",
    "an azimuthal stellar magnetic field is considered .",
    "the vector field is @xmath46 .",
    "calculation of faraday rotation along a sightline requires determination of the los field component , which is given by    @xmath47    the transformation between the observer and stellar coordinates is needed to evaluate the preceding dot product ; the rotation matrix between coordinate systems is given by    @xmath48    consequently , one obtains    @xmath49    in addition to the los field component , the distribution of the field strength with location about the star is also needed .",
    "we adopt the kinematic prescription put forth in ignace , bjorkman , & cassinelli ( 1998 ) based on wind compression theory ( bjorkman & cassinelli 1993 ) .",
    "the ignace  model assumes a magnetic field that is dynamically negligible as compared to the wind flow . assuming flux freezing , the axisymmetric field topology can be derived , a result they refer to as `` wcfields '' .",
    "their model includes a parameter for the axisymmetric density distribution . for our purposes",
    "this parameter , @xmath50 , is set to unity for a spherical wind ; then using their asymptotic formula ( eq .  [ 21 ] of ignace  1998 ) , the azimuthal field becomes simply    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the co - latitude on the star , signifying that the maximum toroidal field strength occurs at the rotational equator of the star ; and for the model of ignace , the conveniently defined effective surface field strength , @xmath53 , depends on the actual surface field strength @xmath54 , the stellar rotation speed @xmath55 , and the wind terminal speed @xmath56 , with    @xmath57    calculation of the faraday rotation proceeds from a sightline - dependent integration through the bubble , as given by    @xmath58\\,\\left[\\frac{n_{\\rm e}(r)}{n_{\\rm w}}\\right]\\,(\\hat{z }      \\cdot\\hat{\\varphi})\\,dz,\\ ] ]    with @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a density scale associated with the wind .",
    "this integral reduces to    @xmath61    note that @xmath62 for our coordinate system definitions .",
    "given that @xmath63 , the coordinate @xmath64 can be factored out of the integral which now becomes    @xmath65    to solve this equation , we note that @xmath66 , where @xmath39 is the impact parameter of the sightline under consideration , and therefore a constant of the integration .",
    "the sightline enters the bubble at @xmath67 and exits at @xmath68 , where @xmath69 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "back - front symmetry of the integration gives    @xmath70    which , after some rearrangement , has the solution    @xmath71 ,      \\label{eq : azsoln}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "there are several key comments to be made about this solution .",
    "* first , the appearance of the factor of @xmath64 means that the pa map is left - right _ antisymmetric _ about the line of @xmath74 in the plane of the sky . *",
    "second , the overall morphology of the pa map is _ independent _ of viewing inclination .",
    "the inclination angle appears in the solution only in the multiplicative factor @xmath75 , acting as an amplitude scale .",
    "consequently , the pa map for the edge - on view is the same map that results for any other inclination , just the amount of pa rotation is reduced for every sightline by @xmath75 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows a false - color plot of the pa map ( or after proper normalization , the rm map ) for the solution of equation  ( [ eq : azsoln ] ) . based on our conventions , the positive @xmath76-axis points down in this figure , and the positive @xmath64-axis points right ; together these give positive @xmath35 toward the observer .",
    "the map is indeed left - right antisymmetric and top - down symmetric .",
    "additionally , because the azimuthal field is everywhere perpendicular to the los for @xmath74 , @xmath77 along the vertical that passes through the map center .",
    "no absolute scale is given in this figure as it depends on a number of wind and star parameters , such as the surface field strength , the mass - loss rate , wind speed , and stellar radius as well as the bubble radius ( hence , its age ) .",
    "we return to the expected level of pa and applications in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "it is useful to consider a different field topology to explore the range of pa map morphologies that can result in stellar bubbles .",
    "an azimuthal field exhibits the most shallow radial decline expected for a field that is carried out by a stellar wind .",
    "the next most shallow decline would be a split monopole .",
    "this is a radial magnetic field with a field strength @xmath78 , but the polarity changes sign from one hemisphere to the other .",
    "so the field is outward directed in one hemisphere , but inward in the other .",
    "such a magnetic configuration is what would be expected of a strong stellar wind that distorts a dipole field at the star into a radial geometry ( e.g. , ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) .",
    "calculation of pa maps proceeds as before , except that now there are different factors appearing in the integrand because of the new field topology . instead of @xmath79 for the azimuthal field case , we now have @xmath80 for a radial field .",
    "the integral takes on the form :    @xmath81      \\left[\\frac{b_{\\rm r}(r)}{b_\\ast}\\right]\\ , \\left(\\frac{z}{r}\\right)\\,dz.\\ ] ]    before proceeding , the split monopole case offers a new wrinkle for the calculation of the faraday rotation . the radial field switches polarity between hemispheres .",
    "consequently , at a general viewing inclination , the net faraday rotation cancels identically for sightlines which do _ not _ intercept the magnetic equator .",
    "such sightlines enter and exit the bubble in a hemispherical cap of just one field polarity . as a result",
    ", there is as much clockwise pa rotation through , say , the first half of the pathlength as there is counterclockwise contribution through the second half .",
    "the radial field ensures that for every value of @xmath7 along the path , there is a corresponding value of @xmath82 at a reflected position in a back - front sense along the path .",
    "these two positions of opposed los field components occur at the same radius from the star , and therefore occur at the same density .",
    "a polarity switch , and therefore a net faraday rotation , only occurs for sightlines that intercept the magnetic equator .",
    "the result of all this is that a pair of truncated hemispherical caps appear at top and bottom in the pa maps for the split monopole case .",
    "the extent of these truncations depends on the viewing inclination . for the pole - on case",
    ", every sightline passes through the magnetic equator , and there are no truncation zones .",
    "the extreme opposite case is the edge - on view ; here , no sightlines pass through the magnetic equator , and so @xmath29 is identically zero everywhere . in observer coordinates the truncation occurs for @xmath83 .    for sightlines that do intercept the magnetic equator ,",
    "the location along the path where this occurs , @xmath84 , must be known so that the sign change is properly taken account in the integration . for sightlines with @xmath85 ,",
    "the integral becomes    @xmath86    where a sightline with impact parameter @xmath39 at observer azimuth @xmath37 for a split monopole viewed at inclination @xmath43 will intercept the equatorial plane at location    @xmath87    evaluating the integral of equation  ( [ eq : psisplit ] ) , along with some algebraic manipulation , leads to    @xmath88.\\ ] ]    this solution is displayed in figure  [ fig3 ] at a viewing inclination angle of @xmath89 .",
    "unlike the case of an azimuthal field , the scaling of the results for the pa is more complicated with viewing inclination .",
    "the truncated caps are inclination dependent .",
    "the pa maps for a split monopole are markedly different from that of an azimuthal field as seen in figure  [ fig2 ] . whereas the azimuthal field produces an antisymmetric morphology , all the faraday rotations for a split monopole are of the same sense : either everywhere clockwise or everywhere counterclockwise .",
    "as noted previously , the effects of faraday rotation are much smaller across the bubble for a split monopole than for an azimuthal field .",
    "however , assuming that @xmath90 for the vast majority of sightlines in the split monopole case , the bubble still influences the pa map of the region because of differential rm effects for sightlines intercepting the bubble versus those that do not .",
    "in other words even if @xmath91 , the mere presence of the bubble means that @xmath28 may still be significant .",
    "more will be said about this in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "for the last application , consider again the azimuthal field case . to simulate a two - wind interaction , where an inner wind ( or a supernova ejecta shell ) is blown into , and sweeps up , an outer wind from a earlier stage of stellar evolution , we impose a central spherical region that does not contribute to faraday rotation",
    ". this could be either because the central region has no magnetic field or because it consists of neutral gas ( the latter being unlikely for applications to massive stars ) .",
    "the overall scenario is intended to approximate situations like the production of a pn , or a fast wind from a blue supergiant overtaking a slower denser red giant wind ( e.g. , chita  2008 ) , or a sn explosion that expands into the wind of a progenitor phase .    to be specific ,",
    "we define an interior boundary of radius @xmath92 , now with @xmath93 the outer bubble radius . for @xmath94",
    "the region is effectively a `` cavity '' in terms of its contribution to the faraday rotation along a sightline .",
    "the polarization pa , @xmath29 , now becomes    @xmath95    where @xmath96 for @xmath97 , but for @xmath98 , @xmath99 takes on the value    @xmath100    detailed steps for the derivation of @xmath29 as a function of sightline , along with a generalization to a power - law density , are given in the appendix . figure",
    "[ fig4 ] shows examples of the resulting pa maps for cavities of different relative extents with @xmath101 , 0.5 , and 0.75 .",
    "the maps remain left - right antisymmetric as in section  [ sub : azi ] , but now two maxima appear in the form of arcs .    not surprisingly , these maps are quite reminiscent of the morphologies seen in snr g296.5 + 10.0 ( harvey - smith  2010 ) . in that report a discussion and derivation similar to this paper are presented .",
    "harvey - smith  introduced a toroidal field to explain the antisymmetric dependence of rm observed in the snr .",
    "those authors additionally included density and magnetic field enhancements arising from a shock .",
    "these are additional relevant ingredients that we have not incorporated here , but such effects could be included either in a phenomenological way or using detailed dynamical simulations .",
    "our approach highlights the robust nature of the antisymmetric pa map morphology provided by an azimuthal field along with the appearance of arc - like features arising from the presence of a `` cavity '' , a region devoid of any contribution to faraday rotation .",
    "the objective of this paper has been to elucidate the effects of faraday rotation through a stellar bubble by evaluating of pa maps ( or equivalently rm maps ) under certain simplifying assumptions to focus on broad morphological trends . as such , spherical",
    "symmetry has been assumed for the geometry of the bubble and the run of density , specifically a wind type density that drops as @xmath24 with radius . at this point",
    "it is worth commenting on the limitations of this approach , the kinds of effects that need to be included for application to particular types of bubbles , and strategies for best extracting information about the properties of the bubble and its immediate environment .",
    "the case of an azimuthal stellar magnetic field is likely the only one of observational relevance because of its more gradual decline in field strength as @xmath23 to allow for detection at the 110  pc scale of stellar bubbles .",
    "a robust prediction of even the simplified models presented here is that a sign reversal in polarization pa ( or rm ) is expected when an azimuthal field plays a role in the faraday rotation .",
    "however , that sign reversal will only be achieved if the @xmath29 term can be isolated .",
    "imagine a situation in which the ism along a sightline passing near to a bubble , but without intercepting the bubble , produces a pa value of the form :    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the relevant length scale over which one can define an average product of the interstellar magnetic field and electron number density .",
    "in other words :    @xmath104    assuming that this average value is what would have been sampled for a sightline through the bubble , and further assuming spherical symmetry , the decrement to the interstellar pa rotation caused by the presence of the bubble as a function of impact parameter is    @xmath105    the ism is highly inhomogeneous in terms of its magnetic field distribution , density , and ionization .",
    "consequently , one hardly expects that @xmath106 at the location of the wind bubble would equal the pathlength - averaged value @xmath107 .",
    "still , it is useful to consider the resultant pa map from the combination of the different contributions by adopting such a scenario . choosing @xmath108 and @xmath109 , figure  [ fig5]a shows a pa map and contours for an azimuthal field case , similar to the style of previous figures , but now with the faraday rotation contribution from the ism included",
    ". additionally , figure  [ fig5]b displays what the measured pa would be along an axis at @xmath110 .    figure  [ fig5 ] is important for illustrating how to infer the various components to the measured value of @xmath111 . if one could measure the pa map across a wind - blown bubble with an azimuthal field , the following outlines how to decompose the trace of the signal in figure  [ fig5]b to determine @xmath26 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "note that it is assumed that the interstellar field and electron density in the vicinity of the bubble is approximately constant ( or at least smoothly varying ) .",
    "* for @xmath112 , the pa is set by sightlines that do not intercept the bubble and therefore sample the interstellar field and electron density .",
    "* for @xmath113 , the sightlines intercept the bubble .",
    "the azimuthal field leads to @xmath29 that is predicted to be antisymmetric , but the decrement term @xmath28 is symmetric .",
    "the result is a left - right asymmetric profile . *",
    "the two peaks in figure  [ fig5](b ) can be used to deduce the amplitude of @xmath29 .",
    "the vertical blue double - arrowed line represents the total change in the pa rotation owing to the bubble contribution . introducing @xmath114 as being the maximum pa rotation through the bubble at location @xmath115",
    ", the blue arrow has an amplitude of @xmath116 .",
    "the value of @xmath117 is related to the scale length @xmath118 that depends on the wavelength of observation , the density scale of the bubble , and importantly the surface field strength of the star .",
    "bisection of the vertical arrow , as illustrated with the horizontal dotted line , yields the value of @xmath117 . *",
    "the bisection mentioned in the previous point gives the maximum decrement due to @xmath28 . with spherical symmetry , one should expect a distribution of this decrement as indicated by the green dashed line .",
    "bear in mind that the particular example of figure  [ fig5 ] implicitly assumes a local interstellar field of positive polarity , which leads to the bowl - shaped decrement as shown .",
    "if the local field were of the opposite polarity , the `` decrement '' would in fact produce an _ inverted _ bowl shape , meaning that the green line for @xmath28 would lie above @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , the decomposition process gives both the strength of the local magnetic field and its polarity .",
    "as one last comment , it is possible that no decrement is found .",
    "such a result would arise if the interstellar field in the locale of the bubble were very low , or if the local ism were of low ionization .    to be yet more quantitative , it is possible to relate a measured value of @xmath117 from the bubble contribution to the length scale @xmath118 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : azsoln ] ) gives the solution for @xmath29 in the azimuthal field case .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] plots the value of @xmath119 as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "in other words holding @xmath76 fixed , and measuring the polarization pa in a direction perpendicular to the axis of antisymmetry , figure  [ fig6 ] provides the location @xmath120 .",
    "the scaling for the pa rotation increases rapidly with decreasing value of the impact parameter , @xmath39 .",
    "consequently , the strongest measurable effect of the bubble for faraday rotation will be around the center of the projected bubble . at these locations",
    "one has @xmath121 , for which @xmath122 is easily derived to be    @xmath123    which is indicated by the blue line in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath117 is also straightforwardly derivable as    @xmath124    where @xmath117 appears to diverge as @xmath125 , for which @xmath126 as well .",
    "first , the apparent divergence does not take place owing to the finite size of the star .",
    "second , although large values of @xmath117 can be achieved , the polarization pa suffers a @xmath18 degeneracy .",
    "many rotations in @xmath3 over a small observed angular scale rapidly leads to polarimetric cancellation . for expected star , wind , and bubble parameters , the vast majority of the bubble will like have at best a modest value of @xmath3 , except perhaps at quite long wavelengths",
    "] is measured from the data corresponding to a selection of @xmath76 on the pa map . from these measures",
    "one can determine @xmath127 from the data . in the absence of any other information",
    ", there is an inclination ambiguity .",
    "still , an upper limit to @xmath118 is obtained from assuming an edge - on view of the system , in which case a lower limit to the stellar surface magnetic field strength is also obtained .",
    "the overall scale of the pa rotation through a stellar bubble is set by a combination of stellar and wind parameters and the size of the bubble itself ( which , of course , is related to its age ) . for the azimuthal field case , which is the one most likely to be of observational significance",
    ", we have already that @xmath128 . for the number density of electrons in a spherical stellar wind",
    ", we have been using @xmath129 .",
    "the density scale constant is given by    @xmath130    where @xmath131 is the mass - loss rate , @xmath132 is the mean molecular weight per free electron , and @xmath56 is the wind terminal speed .",
    "then the scale constant for faraday rotation becomes    @xmath133    this scale parameter is found to be larger for stars with stronger surface fields , larger size , and higher mass - loss winds ; it is smaller for faster winds and larger ( older ) bubbles .",
    "it also has the standard quadratic dependence on wavelength .    using the preceding expressions",
    ", one can derive a ratio of the stellar radius to the faraday rotation length scale for the bubble , @xmath118 , to be    @xmath134    the scale of this ratio is huge and thus warrants a comment of interpretation .",
    "implicit is that the length scale for faraday rotation @xmath118 has been evaluated for the magnetic field and wind density near the stellar surface , which are enormous compared to interstellar conditions . as a result , @xmath118 is driven to incredibly small values on the order of 1  cm and less .",
    "however , expected values of faraday rotation across the bubble are much smaller than at the scale of the star . defining an associated scale @xmath135 related to the dimensions of the bubble instead of the star gives @xmath136 , which when using the parameterization of equation  ( [ eq : zb ] ) is of order @xmath137 . in other words",
    "the length scale associated with rotation of the polarization pa through @xmath18 is roughly 100 times larger than the radius of the bubble .",
    "the goal of this study has been to develop insight into the possibilities of using faraday rotation to probe stellar magnetism in wind - blown bubbles .",
    "adopting spherical symmetry and considering two field topologies of azimuthal and split monopole fields , analytic and semi - analytic results were presented in the form of pa maps arising from faraday rotation across a stellar wind bubble .",
    "the field strength for a split monopole declines too fast to have detectable effects for faraday rotation .",
    "instead , only the azimuthal field scenario is likely to lead to detectable signals , for which the key result derived here is the antisymmetric morphology for the pa rotations ( or equivalently , the rms ) across the bubble in addition to a simple @xmath75 scaling of the amplitude of pa rotation .",
    "inclusion of a central spherical region of zero magnetic field leads to prominent and antisymmetric pa rotations in arc - like structures like those observed in snr g296.5 + 10.0 ( harvey - smith  2010 ) .    to date",
    ", studies of faraday rotation effects across hii regions appear consistent with variations in the interstellar magnetic field ( e.g. , harvey - smith , madsen , & gaensler 2011 ) .",
    "clearly there may be only a restricted subset of bubbles for which our models will have applications .",
    "moreover , dispersion in the interstellar rm may present challenges in detection and interpretation of the effects we have described even when present , as for example variations in the interstellar rm can have typical amplitudes of order 10 rad / m@xmath2 ( mao  2010 ) .",
    "we are considering strategies for interpreting the interaction of interstellar magnetic fields with stellar bubbles using faraday rotation effects .",
    "given recent results in relation to snr g296.5 + 10.0 , the pn cases ( ransom  2008 , 2010 ) , and the rosette nebula ( savage  2012 ) , faraday rotation offers great promise as a means of using stellar bubbles to discern the properties of stellar and/or interstellar magnetic fields .",
