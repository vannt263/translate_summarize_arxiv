    "multipartite entanglement is a crucial resource for many tasks in quantum information science , but its quantification is difficult due to the existence of different types of entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is therefore unsurprising that many different entanglement measures have been proposed in order to quantify the amount of entanglement of multipartite quantum states @xcite .",
    "here we build upon our results about highly and maximally entangled permutation - symmetric quantum states in terms of the geometric measure of entanglement @xcite . this restriction to a subset of quantum states  studied under a particular entanglement measure  makes it possible to gain strong results @xcite , and to find a rare visual representation of multipartite entanglement .",
    "permutation - symmetric quantum states are invariant under any permutation of their subsystems .",
    "such states appear in many - body physics , and they have found use in leader election @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they have been actively implemented experimentally @xcite , and their symmetric properties facilitate the analysis of entanglement @xcite . in order to analyze the usefulness of symmetric states for measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc ) @xcite , the geometric measure of entanglement",
    "is particularly suited , because the classification of states as mbqc - resources has been performed in terms of this measure @xcite .",
    "the central tool for our analysis of symmetric entanglement is the majorana representation @xcite , a generalization of the bloch sphere representation of single qubits . by means of this representation",
    "any @xmath0 qubit symmetric state can be unambiguously mapped to @xmath0 points on the surface of the unit sphere .",
    "recently the majorana representation has been used to search for and characterize different classes of slocc entanglement @xcite , which is related to the classification of phases in spinor condensates @xcite .",
    "it has also been employed to search for the `` least classical '' state of a spin-@xmath1 system @xcite , and the solutions of this problem are intimately related to the maximally entangled symmetric states .",
    "furthermore , the majorana representation has been used for the study of spherical designs @xcite , berry phases in high spin systems @xcite , quantum chaos @xcite , optimal resources for reference frame alignment @xcite , phase estimation @xcite , phases in spinor bec @xcite , classicality in terms of the discriminability of states @xcite , for finding solutions to the lipkin - meshkov - glick model @xcite and for finding efficient proofs of the kochen - specker theorem @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section [ geometric_measure ] we briefly recapitulate the geometric measure of entanglement .",
    "this is followed by section [ symm_states ] where the geometric entanglement of permutation - symmetric states and its implications for mbqc is discussed . in section [ majorana_representation ] the majorana representation",
    "is introduced for symmetric states of @xmath0 qubits , which is followed by section [ analytic ] which reviews our analytical and numerical findings that we recently published in @xcite . in section [ solutions ]",
    "the usefulness of the majorana representation is demonstrated for highly entangled symmetric states whose point distributions are described by platonic solids .",
    "the entanglement of such states is particularly easy to determine with the known theoretical results , and it is found that there exists an intriguing analogy with the dual polyhedra of the platonic solids @xcite .",
    "anticoherent spin states @xcite and the mathematical concept of spherical designs @xcite are briefly mentioned , and it is shown that in general the maximally entangled symmetric states do not represent anticoherent states or spherical designs .",
    "finally , section [ discussion ] concludes this article with a summary of our results .",
    "the geometric measure of entanglement is a distance - like entanglement measure in the sense that it assesses the entanglement in terms of the remoteness from the set of separable states @xcite .",
    "it is defined as the maximal overlap of a normalized pure state with all normalized pure product states @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 a product state closest to @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath4 , and it should be kept in mind that a given @xmath3 can have more than one closest product state .",
    "the problem of maximizing the entanglement can be written as a max - min - problem : @xmath5    the geometric measure is closely related to the robustness of entanglement @xmath6 @xcite and the relative entropy of entanglement @xmath7 @xcite , two other distance - like entanglement measures .",
    "the inequalities @xmath8 hold for all states @xcite , and they become equalities for stabilizer states , dicke states and permutation - antisymmetric basis states @xcite .",
    "some advantages of the geometric measure are its comparatively easy calculation , its applications in related fields of physics @xcite , and its operational interpretations , e.g. in local state discrimination @xcite , additivity of channel capacities @xcite and for the classification of states as resources for measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc)@xcite",
    ".    a general quantum state of a finite - dimensional system can be cast as @xmath9 with complex coefficients @xmath10 and an orthonormal basis @xmath11 .",
    "the state @xmath3 is called real if ( for a given basis ) the @xmath10 are all real , and positive if the @xmath10 are all positive .",
    "every positive state @xmath3 has at least one positive closest product state @xmath4 @xcite , a result which simplifies the determination of their entanglement .",
    "permutation - symmetric quantum states are states that are invariant under any permutation of their subsystems , i.e. @xmath12 for all @xmath13 . for @xmath0",
    "qubits the hilbert space of symmetric states is spanned by the dicke states , the equally weighted sums of all permutations of computational basis states with @xmath14 qubits being @xmath15 and @xmath16 being @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "a general pure symmetric state of @xmath0 qubits is a linear combination of the @xmath20 symmetric basis states @xmath21 .",
    "we will abbreviate this notation to @xmath22 whenever the number of qubits is clear .",
    "it was recently found that all closest product states of multipartite ( @xmath23 3 parts ) symmetric states are symmetric themselves , and that bipartite symmetric states have at least one symmetric closest product state @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that positive symmetric states have at least one positive symmetric closest product state @xcite .",
    "these results considerably reduce the complexity of finding the closest product state and thus the entanglement of a symmetric state .",
    "the theoretical and experimental analysis of symmetric state entanglement , e.g. as entanglement witnesses or in experimental setups @xcite , is valuable , because symmetric states appear in many - body physics .",
    "for example , the ground state of the lipkin - meshkov - glick model is permutation - invariant , and its entanglement has been quantified in term of the geometric measure @xcite .      in this subsection",
    "we will briefly discuss the known upper and lower bounds on the maximal possible amount of geometric entanglement .",
    "it should however be kept in mind that the maximally entangled state and its amount of entanglement depends on the chosen entanglement measure @xcite .",
    "the maximal possible entanglement of general @xmath0 qubit states scales linearly with the number of qubits , namely @xmath24 the left - hand side of the inequality is clear from the trivial example of an @xmath0 qubit state ( @xmath0 even ) composed of @xmath25 bipartite bell states , or from 2d cluster states @xcite .",
    "the upper bound was derived in @xcite .",
    "it is also known that most @xmath0 qubit states are much closer to the upper bound than to the lower bound .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath26 qubits the overwhelming majority of states have entanglement @xmath27 @xcite .    for symmetric states",
    "a trivial lower bound can be derived from the dicke states .",
    "a closest product state of @xmath21 is known @xcite to be @xmath28 from this the entanglement follows as @xmath29 the maximally entangled dicke state is @xmath30 for even @xmath0 and the two equivalent states @xmath31 and @xmath32 for odd @xmath0 .",
    "their stirling approximation for large @xmath0 yields @xmath33 .",
    "an upper bound to the geometric measure of symmetric @xmath0 qubit states has been derived from the decomposition of the identity on symmetric subspace , yielding @xmath34 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "an alternative proof with the benefit of being visually accessible by means of the majorana representation will be given in theorem [ const_integral ] .",
    "combining these bounds , it is seen that the maximal symmetric entanglement of @xmath0 qubits scales as @xmath35 i.e. polylogarithmically between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "numerical evidence suggests that the actual values are much closer to the upper bound than to the lower bound , and @xmath38 can be considered a reliable lower bound @xcite .",
    "we have seen that the maximal entanglement of symmetric states scales much slower than that of general states , namely logarithmically rather than linearly .",
    "this need not be a disadvantage for symmetric states , though , and in fact could render them useful for mbqc @xcite , because it was shown that if the entanglement of a state is too large , then it can not be a good resource for mbqc . more specifically , if the @xmath0 qubit entanglement scales larger than @xmath39 for some constant @xmath40 , then such a computation can be simulated efficiently classically @xcite .",
    "this rules out many general quantum states as mbqc resources , but not symmetric ones .    on the other hand , universal resources for mbqc",
    "must be maximally entangled in a certain sense @xcite .",
    "considering the qualitative departure of the scaling relation from , it is questionable whether symmetric states are sufficiently entangled to be mbqc resources .",
    "indeed , permutation - symmetric states can be ruled out as exact , deterministic mbqc resources , because their entanglement does not scale faster - than - logarithmically @xcite .",
    "somewhat weaker requirements are imposed upon approximate , stochastic mbqc resources @xcite , although this generally leads only to a small extension of the class of suitable resources in the vicinity of exact , deterministic resources ( e.g. 2d cluster states with holes ) .",
    "it is therefore believed that symmetric states can not be used even for approximate , stochastic mbqc .    as an example",
    ", we will show that dicke states with a fixed number of excitations can not be useful for @xmath41-approximate , deterministic mbqc @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath41-approximate universal resource states can be converted into any other state by locc with an inaccuracy of at most @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath41-version of the geometric measure @xcite is defined as @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a distance that is `` strictly related to the fidelity '' , meaning that for any two states @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a strictly monotonically increasing function with @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 can be understood as the guaranteed entanglement obtained from a preparation of @xmath44 with inaccuracy @xmath41 .",
    "one possible choice of @xmath43 is the trace distance , which for pure states reads @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the fidelity . in this case one can choose @xmath52 .",
    "as shown in example 1 of @xcite , the family of w states @xmath53 , with @xmath54 , is not an @xmath41-approximate universal resource for @xmath55 .",
    "this result can be generalized to all families of dicke states @xmath56 with a fixed number of excitations @xmath16 .    for any",
    "fixed @xmath57 the family of dicke states @xmath56 can not be an @xmath41-approximate universal mbqc resource for @xmath58 .    using equation and the stirling approximation for high @xmath0",
    ", the asymptotic geometric entanglement of the family @xmath59 is found to be @xmath60 specifically , the amount of geometric entanglement remains finite for arbitrary values of @xmath0 , allowing us to apply proposition 3 and theorem 1 of @xcite to show that the necessary condition for @xmath41-approximate deterministic universality , @xmath61 is violated for @xmath62 .",
    "of course , it should be noted that many other quantum information tasks are not restricted by the requirements of mbqc - universality , and that highly entangled symmetric states can therefore be valuable resources for such tasks .",
    "the classical angular momentum @xmath63 of a physical system can be represented by a single point on the surface of the unit sphere in @xmath64 , corresponding to the direction of @xmath63 .",
    "quantum mechanics does not allow for such a simple representation , but it is possible to uniquely represent a pure state of spin-@xmath1 by @xmath65 undistinguishable points on the sphere @xcite . this is a generalization of the bloch sphere representation of a qubit .",
    "an equivalent representation can be shown to exist for symmetric states of @xmath0 spin-@xmath66 particles @xcite , with an isomorphism mediating between all states of a spin-@xmath1 particle and the symmetric states of @xmath65 qubits .",
    "hence , this `` majorana representation '' allows us to uniquely compose any symmetric state of @xmath0 qubits @xmath67 from a sum over all permutations @xmath68 of @xmath0 undistinguishable qubits @xmath69 : @xmath70 and where the normalization factor @xmath71 depends on the given state .",
    "the identity allows the visualization of the multi - qubit state @xmath67 by @xmath0 points on a sphere . in the following these points",
    "will be called the _ majorana points _ ( mp ) , and the sphere on which they lie the _ majorana sphere_.    as outlined in the previous section , for @xmath72 qubits every closest product state @xmath73 of a symmetric state @xmath67 is symmetric itself @xcite , and can therefore be written as @xmath74 , with a single qubit state @xmath75 .",
    "the closest product states of a given symmetric state can therefore be visualized by bloch vectors too , and in analogy to the majorana points , we call @xmath75 a _ closest product point _ ( cpp ) .    for symmetric states the scalar product from the definition of the geometric measure can be concisely expressed in terms of the mps and a cpp : @xmath76 to determine the cpp of a given symmetric state , one therefore has to maximize the absolute value of a product of scalar products .",
    "the factors @xmath77 are the angles between the corresponding bloch vectors on the majorana sphere , thus turning the determination of the cpp into a geometrical optimization problem .    from equation",
    "it follows that the application on an arbitrary single - qubit unitary operation @xmath78 to each of the @xmath0 subsystems of a symmetric state @xmath67 yields @xmath79 thus the symmetric state @xmath67 is mapped to a symmetric state @xmath80 whose mp distribution can be obtained from a joint rotation of the mps of @xmath67 along a common axis on the majorana sphere .",
    "the two locc - equivalent states @xmath67 and @xmath80 have the same _ relative _ mp distribution , and therefore the same number and relative distribution of cpps , as well as the same amount of entanglement .      for pure symmetric states of two qubits the only absolute degree of freedom in the majorana representation ( and hence entanglement )",
    "is the distance between the two mps .",

    "this is however not the maximally entangled symmetric state , and a numerical search yields the `` square pyramid state '' @xmath152 , shown in figure [ bloch_5](b ) , as the maximally entangled one .",
    "all its mps and cpps can be determined analytically by solving quartic equations .",
    "one on the five cpps coincides with the north pole while the other four are equidistantly spread over a horizontal plane in the southern hemisphere .",
    "notably , the `` center of mass '' of the five mps of @xmath153 does not coincide with the origin of the sphere , and the implications of this will be outlined in section [ anticoherent_queens ] .    there is strong evidence that the `` icosahedron state '' @xmath154 , shown in figure [ icosahedronpic1](a ) , is the maximally entangled symmetric state of 12 qubits .",
    "the mps form the vertices of a regular icosahedron , while the 20 cpps are centered on the faces of the icosahedron , describing a dodecahedron inside the majorana sphere .",
    "figure [ icosahedronpic1](b ) is the spherical plot of the function @xmath155 which already appeared as the integrand of equation .",
    "this function is variously known as the characteristic polynomial , majorana polynomial @xcite , amplitude function @xcite or coherent state decomposition @xcite .",
    "the cpps and mps of a symmetric state can be readily identified as the global maxima and the antipodes of the zeros of @xmath156 , respectively .",
    "figure7a ( -5,0)(a )    figure7b ( -5,0)(b )      each of the five platonic solids shown in figure [ platonic ] has a dual polyhedron with faces and vertices interchanged , and this dual polyhedron is again a platonic solid @xcite . as seen in figure [ platonic_dual ] , the octahedron and cube form a dual pair , and",
    "so do the icosahedron and dodecahedron .",
    "in contrast to this , the tetrahedron is self - dual , i.e. it is its own dual .",
    "figure8a    figure8b    figure8c    interestingly , these dualities are also inherited to the majorana representations of the corresponding symmetric quantum states .",
    "for example , we have seen that the 20 cpps of the icosahedron state @xmath157 form the vertices of a dodecahedron .",
    "on the other hand , when considering the 20 qubit `` dodecahedron state '' @xmath158 , it is easy to show that this state has 12 cpps which occupy the vertices of an icosahedron .",
    "thus the majorana representation of the dodecahedron state can be immediately obtained from figure [ icosahedronpic1 ] ( a ) by interchanging the mps and cpps .",
    "the same duality exists between the octahedron state and the cube state , c.f .",
    "figure [ 6_cpps ] ( c ) .",
    "furthermore , the tetrahedron state is its own dual , as seen in figure [ 4_cpps ] ( d ) . unlike the dual of the platonic solid , however , the dual tetrahedron state is not turned `` upside down '' as seen in figure [ platonic_dual ] , but rather coincides with the original tetrahedron state .",
    "as outlined in section [ majorana_representation ] , there exists an isomorphism between the states of a spin-@xmath1 particle and the symmetric states of @xmath65 qubits .",
    "the coherent states of a quantum particle can be regarded as the most classical states , and in terms of the majorana representation these states are those whose mps all coincide at a single point , thus describing a `` classical '' spin vector .",
    "anticoherent spin states , first studied in @xcite , are states that exhibit maximally nonclassical behavior in the sense that their spin vector vanishes . since such states can be considered the `` opposite '' of coherent states , it would be interesting to determine the mps and the geometric entanglement of their symmetric counterparts . for example , one could ask whether maximally entangled symmetric states correspond to anticoherent states or to the mathematical concept of spherical designs @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that the `` center of mass '' of the five qubit square pyramid state @xmath159 does not coincide with the origin of the majorana sphere straightforwardly implies that this state is neither anticoherent nor a spherical design @xcite .",
    "an alternative to anticoherent states was formulated in @xcite , where the least classical states are coined `` queens of quantum '' .",
    "the majorana representations of these states differ from our maximally entangled symmetric states , but when replacing the hilbert - schmidt metric with the bures metric @xcite , the solutions of the two problems become identical . in other words , the majorana representation of the spin-@xmath1 `` queen of quantum '' in terms of the bures",
    "metric is identical to that of the maximally entangled symmetric state of @xmath65 qubits in terms of the geometric measure .",
    "we have analyzed and discussed the geometric entanglement of highly and maximally entangled symmetric states of @xmath0 qubits .",
    "the upper bound on symmetric entanglement rules out symmetric states as exact , deterministic mbqc resources . for the case of",
    "approximate mbqc we present arguments against the usefulness of symmetric states , and provide a proof for the class of dicke states . with the known analytic results about the majorana representation of symmetric states it is easy to numerically determine the most entangled states and to discuss their properties . as an example we showed how the determination of the cpps of `` platonic states '' is greatly simplified with the help of the theoretical results . with the help of the maximally entangled symmetric five qubit state",
    "it was shown that the solutions to the majorana problem do not necessarily relate to anticoherent states or spherical designs .",
    "it is found that the well - known concept of the dual polyhedra of platonic solids possesses a direct analog for symmetric quantum states , thereby deepening the relationship between the majorana representation and the polyhedra of classical geometry .",

    "mm thanks the `` special coordination funds for promoting science and technology '' for financial support .",
    "there exist two common definitions of the geometric measure , which we distinguish by denoting @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",

    "this readily follows from @xmath163 . for spherical designs we observe that by setting @xmath164 in definition 2 of @xcite , it follows that for all spherical designs the `` center of mass '' must necessarily coincide with the sphere s origin"
