    "disordered systems are characterized by two kinds of variables : dynamical variables , with mean relaxation time @xmath12 , and `` structural '' variables , related to the randomness of the system and with mean relaxation time @xmath13 . as introduced by brout @xcite , there are two limits in which disorder problems can be formally treated , namely , the annealed and the quenched limits .",
    "the latter is appropriate to systems where disorder relaxes in a much longer time scale than dynamical variables ( @xmath14 ) , and so disorder variables can be considered as effectively frozen .",
    "the opposite situation , in which disorder and dynamical variables fluctuate in the same time scale ( @xmath15 ) , corresponds to the annealed limit .",
    "since exact solutions can be found for some models , in these cases it is worthwhile using the annealed limit as an approximation to a quenched system , as it will be further discussed .",
    "[ disorder]as shown by mazo @xcite , the free energy of a random quenched system is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath18 is the absolute temperature of the system , @xmath19 is the fixed probability of occurrence of the random configuration @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the partition function of the system for that particular configuration , and the summations run over all possible configurations @xmath20 .",
    "the second summation in eq.[fq ] is interpreted as due to an entropy of mixing of the random variables .",
    "it is in general ignored , since the only way to measure an entropy is to change it , which is not possible in this case because the probabilities @xmath22 are rigid by assumption .",
    "irrespective of that term , in general one finds that , for almost all thermodynamic functions obtained from the free energy by differentiation , the average value @xmath23 of the function can also be calculated as an average of the corresponding values @xmath24 over all the disorder configurations , @xmath25    when lattice models are considered , disorder is usually represented by site or bond random variables . for example , in problems of adsorption of gas molecules on a crystal surface one may want to consider sites with random potentials or random interactions between particles in different adsorption sites . for simplicity , consider a lattice of @xmath26 sites ( or bonds ) .",
    "suppose that some random variable @xmath27 can take one of @xmath28 values @xmath29 at a given site ( or bond ) @xmath5 with probability @xmath30 , such that @xmath31 .",
    "since that probability is independent of the values of the other random variables in the system , the probability of a particular configuration @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of sites ( or bonds ) to which the value @xmath35 of the random variable is associated in that given configuration @xmath36 .",
    "obviously the @xmath34 s obey the constraint @xmath37 it is possible to show that for this case the entropy of mixing in eq.[fq ] takes the form @xmath38 which is proportional to the volume of the system .",
    "so , if one keeps the entropy of mixing term and tries to calculate ( in appropriate units ) the pressure of a quenched lattice gas the result is @xmath39 , \\label{pqe}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the pressure calculated for a particular configuration @xmath41 .",
    "clearly eq.[pqe ] is a physically incorrect expression for the pressure , since in the zero density limit the first term vanishes , while the second term is positive .",
    "furthermore , in the non - random limit ( @xmath42 for all @xmath43 ) all configurations are identical , but the entropy of mixing still contributes to the `` pressure '' .",
    "finally the entropy of mixing diverges in the continuum limit ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) @xcite .",
    "thus the correct expression for the pressure must lack the entropy of mixing , taking the form @xmath46 which is the expression used in previous studies of random lattice gases @xcite .",
    "the need to drop out the entropy of mixing in the calculation of the pressure of a quenched fluid was also pointed out by singh and kovac @xcite on the basis of the interpretation of that term as an information entropy , introduced by sobotta and wagner @xcite .    for most systems",
    "the quenched limit is more realistic than the annealed limit , since in general @xmath47 , as it happens in spin glasses , for instance .",
    "however , the exact mathematical treatment of the quenched limit is very difficult , due to the fact that the calculation of the free energy involves averaging logarithms of partition functions . on the other hand",
    ", the annealed free energy can be written in the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the average of the partition function over the disorder configurations .",
    "this is often calculated with the constraint that the thermal averages of the random variables obey some prescribed distribution , which is realized by the introduction of lagrange multipliers playing the role of pseudo - chemical potentials .",
    "this implies that in the annealed limit the disorder variables are adjusted so as to minimize the free energy , a procedure which singles out a subset of the disorder configurations and introduces correlations between the disorder variables themselves .",
    "so , the annealed limit is in general not a good approximation to the quenched limit .",
    "nevertheless , morita @xcite showed that a quenched system can be represented by a fictitious ( annealed ) equilibrium system subject to an additional potential , composed of an infinite series of lagrange multipliers adjusted by the ( quenched ) @xmath50-``particle '' correlation functions ( @xmath51 ) for the random variables .",
    "indeed , for various ising models it can be verified that by controlling correlations between pairs of random variables ( @xmath52 ) results for annealed systems approach those of the corresponding quenched systems @xcite .",
    "this treatment introduces mathematical difficulties which are of course increasingly greater , and so this work will analyze the usual case in which one tries to control only the concentration of the random variables ( @xmath53 ) .    in the next section",
    "it will be shown that an entropy of mixing term can also be identified in a large class of annealed models , and must likewise be discarded in order to produce meaningful results .",
    "consider a @xmath26-site @xmath11-dimensional lattice gas model whose particles interact via an arbitrary uniform ( non - random ) potential plus short - range interactions satisfying the annealed probability distribution @xmath54 for all pairs of nearest - neighbor sites @xmath43 and @xmath5 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the uniform term , the summation runs over all nearest - neighbor pairs of sites and @xmath57 for any site @xmath43 , variable @xmath58 if the site is empty or @xmath59 if the site is occupied by a particle .",
    "following the approach of thorpe and beeman for the ising model @xcite , this situation can be formally treated by writing @xmath60 in the form @xmath61 and introducing @xmath28 pseudo - chemical potentials @xmath62 to control the averages of the random numbers @xmath63 , which for all @xmath64 are subject to the constraints @xmath65    the annealed grand partition function of the system is given by @xmath66 \\sum_{\\{n\\}}\\exp \\left [ \\beta \\mu \\sum_{j=1}^{n}n_{j}-\\beta h\\right ] , \\ ] ] where the primed summation runs over those configurations satisfying the first two constraints in [ vinc ] .",
    "after performing the partial trace over the random variables one obtains @xmath67 \\prod_{<i , j>}\\left\\ { \\sum_{k=1}^{m}\\exp \\left [ \\beta \\left ( \\xi _ { k}+j_{k}n_{i}n_{j}\\right ) \\right ] \\right\\ } .",

    "notice that in general the effective interaction @xmath77 depends on the temperature .",

    "the last summation on the right hand side of eq.[fanri ] is an entropy of mixing term , identical to that in eq.[pqe ] , and must be dropped as discussed in sec.[disorder ] . with that correction",

    "it is then clear that , as in the quenched limit , the entropy of mixing term can be made explicit in the free energy of any lattice gas with annealed short - range interactions , and that the correct equation of state can be obtained by discarding that term .",
    "this is a fairly general result and will be applied in the next section to the @xmath0 lattice gas with random nearest - neighbor and uniform long - range interactions .",

    "an alternative approach can be used to solve this problem , namely , the mapping onto the random ising model .",
    "this is discussed in appendix [ equivalence ] and has the advantage of making evident the breaking of hole - particle symmetry .",
    "furthermore , it provides a way of avoiding the use of the maxwell construct by previously locating free energy minima , which directly indicate phase transitions .",
    "the results above are applied to the case in which the nearest - neighbor interactions are selected from the bimodal distribution @xmath119 where the interactions @xmath120 are assumed repulsive ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "this is done in order to introduce competition effects , which , as in the pure model , are responsible for complex behavior . in the absence of competition between short- and long - range interactions",
    "the system presents at most one phase transition .",
    "the ground state properties of the model , discussed in detail in appendix [ ground ] , indicate that at @xmath10 and for @xmath122 the system undergoes at most three phase transitions . for @xmath123 , when there is competition between the nearest - neighbor interactions , at fixed pressure the system can present itself in structures characterized by @xmath7 ( gas phase ) , @xmath124 , @xmath125 ( liquid phases ) , and @xmath9 ( close - packed phase ) . for @xmath126",
    "all nearest - neighbor interactions are repulsive , and the stable phases are those for which @xmath7 ( gas ) , @xmath127 , @xmath125 ( liquid phases ) and @xmath9 ( close - packed ) . for @xmath128",
    "the system undergoes at most two transitions , associated with those of the pure model @xcite , the liquid - phase density being shifted to @xmath125 .",
    "the characterization of the phases @xmath129 , @xmath124 and @xmath130 as liquid phases is based on the instability of the corresponding structures . as in the uniform case ,",
    "the @xmath129 phase at @xmath10 is stable at certain pressures because particles are forced by nearest - neighbor repulsion to occupy every other site of the lattice . at any finite temperature ,",
    "thermal fluctuations overcome the effect of the repulsion , inducing local fluctuations of the density and destroying the structure .",
    "the stability of the @xmath124 and @xmath125 phases at @xmath10 , on the other hand , is related to the existence of interaction domains ( appendix [ ground ] ) .",
    "these are a consequence of the interactions mobility in the annealed limit and are formed as particles are added to the system at fixed volume in order to minimize the free energy . in the @xmath124 phase all sites in the @xmath131 domains",
    "are occupied , while all those in @xmath120 domains are empty .",
    "for @xmath125 all sites in @xmath131 domains and every other site in @xmath120 domains are occupied .",
    "however , interaction domains are also destroyed by thermal flucuations at any finite temperature , making the corresponding structures unstable .    in the following subsections the properties of the model at all temperatures",
    "are discussed for the various possible cases .",
    "the relevant parameters are renormalized by @xmath132 , @xmath133    in passing it should be mentioned that , for repulsive long - range interaction ( @xmath134 ) , the system does not undergo a phase transition irrespective of the sign of the short - range interaction .      for dilute short - range interactions",
    "there are at most two phase transitions , whose critical temperatures are different for @xmath135 because of the breakdown of hole - particle symmetry , as already stated .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath136 of the gas - liquid ( g - l ) transition is always higher than @xmath137 , the critical temperature of the liquid - close - packed ( l - cp ) transition .",
    "this is in agreement to what is verified for the corresponding non - random continuum model @xcite , in which there is no hole - particle symmetry .    for @xmath138",
    "there is always a range of values of @xmath139 in which one or two triple points exist , as can be seen from the reentrant behavior of the triple point temperature ( @xmath140 ) curves in the @xmath141 diagrams of figs .",
    "1(a)-(c ) , for @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively .",
    "the critical temperature of the g - l transition coincides with the triple point temperature for @xmath145 , whose dependence on @xmath146is shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath147 approaches @xmath148 as @xmath149 , while for @xmath150 , where there is no short - range repulsion , @xmath147 approaches @xmath151 .",
    "this is the value of @xmath139 for which @xmath140 vanishes for all @xmath152 when @xmath128 .",
    "examples of the behavior of the isotherms and phase diagrams for @xmath142 are shown in figs . 2 - 4 .",
    "2 , for @xmath153 , there are two - phase transitions even at @xmath10 and there is no triple point . for low temperatures",
    "the derivative of the l - cp transition pressure with respect to @xmath18 is negative .",
    "this is related to the destruction by thermal fluctuations of the interaction domains built at @xmath10 , which makes the effective short - range repulsion weaker , lowering the pressure needed to pack the particles . in fig .",
    "3 , for @xmath154 , there is only one phase transition ( g - cp ) at @xmath10 , although two transitions occur for a range of temperatures above the triple point . in fig .",
    "4 , for @xmath155 , the critical temperature of the l - cp transition coincides with the triple point temperature , and for @xmath156 there is only one phase transition .",
    "the behavior of the system when there are two triple points will be exemplified in the next subsection .",
    "when there is competition between short - range interactions even a small amount of randomness is responsible for interesting behavior , as can be seen in the @xmath157 projection of the coexistence surfaces shown in figs .",
    "5(a ) and ( b ) for @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) , @xmath160 and two slightly different values of @xmath139 . in both cases",
    "there are three phase transitions at @xmath10 , defining in decreasing density the close - packed , the two liquid ( l@xmath161 and l@xmath162 ) and the gas phases .",
    "the lowest critical temperature corresponds to a l@xmath162-g transition . above",
    "that there is an intermediate range of temperatures in which the system presents only two transitions . for @xmath163 that range",
    "is limited by a triple point , immediately above whose temperature there is again three phase transitions , as shown in fig .",
    "but for @xmath164 that triple point is replaced by another critical point , giving rise to a coexistence `` bubble '' , as can be seen in figs .",
    "the @xmath141 diagram for @xmath159 and @xmath165 is shown in fig .",
    "when the long - range attraction is sufficiently weak the system can present three phase transitions , whose critical temperatures are shown as solid lines in the figure .",
    "triple points ( broken lines ) are present for intermediate values of @xmath139 .",
    "the breaking and the reentrant behavior of the @xmath136 curve , evident in the inset of fig .",
    "6 , is related to the appearance of coexistence `` bubbles '' . that unusual behavior is observed only for values of @xmath152 between @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "the system may also present a quadruple point , i.e. coexistence of four phases , if @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "this is exemplified for @xmath170 and @xmath142 in the @xmath141 diagram in fig .",
    "7 , where four triple point curves ( dotted lines ) intersect at the quadruple point @xmath171 .",
