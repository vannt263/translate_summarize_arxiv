    "time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) has seen a surge of applications in recent years  @xcite , with calculations of electronic excitations in a wide variety of systems of physical , chemical , and biochemical interest .",
    "errors in tddft excitation energies are typically within a few tenths of an ev , while implementations can scale with size even more favorably than that of time - dependent hartree - fock . in principle , tddft yields _ exact _ excitation spectra : the errors are due to approximations to the exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals . approximations enter at two stages in usual linear response calculations : first , in the xc contribution to the one - body ground - state kohn - sham ( ks ) potential out of which bare excitations are calculated .",
    "for example , its too rapid asymptotic decay in lda / gga causes problems for high - lying bound states  @xcite .",
    "second , the dynamic xc kernel must be approximated ; this corrects the bare ks transitions towards the true transitions .",
    "almost all calculations employ an adiabatic approximation , which entirely neglects frequency - dependence in the kernel .",
    "its remarkable success for many excitations is not well understood .",
    "understanding where it fails is important in constructing more accurate functional approximations .",
    "the lack of frequency - dependence is why adiabatic tddft ( atddft ) fails for states of double excitation character  @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations , atom trapping , and photoassociation spectroscopy all need accurate calculations of excited molecular dissociation curves  @xcite , but these are challenging for approximate methods .",
    "even ground - state dissociation is difficult  @xcite .",
    "closely linked are the difficulties in obtaining long - range charge - transfer ( ct ) excitations .",
    "the latter are notoriously underestimated in atddft  @xcite , yet are vital in biological and chemical systems large enough that density functional methods are the only feasible approach .",
    "we show here that a strong frequency - dependence in the kernel is needed near _ every _ excitation of a molecule composed of two different open - shell fragments at large separation : the ubiquitous adiabatic approximation fails for _ all _ excitations .",
    "we show this is due to static correlation in the ks ground - state , leading to every single excitation being almost degenerate with a double excitation .",
    "we resolve what the frequency - dependence of the exact xc kernel is for the tails of excited dissociation curves , and derive an approximation based on this .",
    "our kernel yields both charge - transfer and local excitations , and contains the correct dissociation limit and leading - order polarization .",
    "it bootstraps an adiabatic approximation , and yields results to the same good level of accuracy that atddft has for more common local excitations : that is , our kernel undoes the problematic static correlation in the ks system .    a crucial role is played by the step structure in the exact ground - state ks potential that develops as a heteroatomic molecule dissociates  @xcite .",
    "the step has size equal to the difference in the ionization potentials of the two fragments , so aligns the highest occupied molecular orbitals ( homos ) of each .",
    "its consequences for tddft have only begun to be explored  @xcite .",
    "recently we showed that near the _ lowest _ ct excitation on each fragment , the step imposes a strong frequency - dependence on the exact kernel  @xcite . here , we go much further , showing the dramatic frequency - dependence required for both higher ct _ and _ all local excitations .",
    "local and ct excitations are intimately entangled by the step in the ks system and we construct the kernel that disentangles them .    it is important to note that although local and semi - local approximations to the ground - state potential ( ie lda and ggas ) lack the step , static correlation still features , since in these cases , the homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) become degenerate as the molecule dissociates .",
    "so , the construction of our xc kernel has relevant implications for the case of the usual approximate ground - state ks potentials too .    in sec .",
