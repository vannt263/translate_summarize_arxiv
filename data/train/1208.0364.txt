    "let @xmath0 be some function from the positive integers @xmath1 into @xmath2 , and let @xmath3 be a graph and @xmath4 some vertex of it .",
    "then we define _ reinforced random walk _ on @xmath3 starting at @xmath4 with reinforcement function @xmath0 as follows .",
    "it is a walk on @xmath3 i.e.  a random sequence of vertices @xmath5 with @xmath6 a neighbour of @xmath7 ; and the transition probabilities depend only on the past .",
    "specifically , for an edge @xmath8 and time @xmath9 we define the number of traversals @xmath10 using @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an unordered edge , so @xmath13 counts traversals of @xmath8 in both directions . now apply @xmath0 and normalize to get probabilities .",
    "totally , the definition is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the neighbourhood relation in our graph .",
    "this finishes the definition of the process .",
    "this is well defined assuming all degrees of all vertices are finite , and we assume this from now on on all our graphs .",
    "there are also versions where reinforcement is applied to vertices or to directed edges , but for simplicity we concentrate for now on edge reinforced walks .",
    "it comes as no surprise that different @xmath0 give different processes , sometimes dramatically so . to make things more concrete",
    "let us discuss a few examples .    1 .",
    "once - reinforced random walk is the process defined by @xmath16 in other words , edges which have already been traversed are given double weight when compared to unknown edges , but the number of traversals does not matter .",
    "2 .   linearly reinforced random walk is the process defined by @xmath17 . in other words , whenever you traverse an edge , you increase its weight by @xmath18 .",
    "3 .   strongly reinforced random walk , where @xmath0 grows faster than linear .",
    "for example , one may take @xmath19 .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , the order of difficulty seems to be decreasing .",
    "once - reinforced random walk is the least understood , while the superlinear case is the simplest .",
    "let us start with the superlinear case .",
    "it turns out that in this case the walk gets stuck on a single edge , going back and forth endlessly . to understand why ,",
    "let us prove the following weaker claim :    let @xmath3 be an arbitrary graph , @xmath4 a vertex of @xmath3 and @xmath8 an edge going out of @xmath20 .",
    "examine reinforced random walk on @xmath3 starting from @xmath4 with reinforcement function @xmath21 .",
    "then with positive probability the process goes back and forth over @xmath8 endlessly i.e.  for all @xmath9 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the other vertex of @xmath8 .",
    "denote the other vertex of @xmath8 by @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 be the event that @xmath22 and @xmath26 for all @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "let us calculate the probability of @xmath29 given @xmath25 .",
    "the numbers of traversals are @xmath30 and @xmath31 for any edge @xmath32 .",
    "hence the probability is @xmath33 for some constant @xmath34 that depends only on the degrees of @xmath4 and @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the probability of @xmath25 is @xmath35 for some positive @xmath36 .",
    "this proves the claim .",
    "there is no zero - one law for the behaviour of processes like reinforced random walk , so one can not easily conclude from the theorem above that some event of interest happens with probability 1 .",
    "nevertheless , this has been proved with almost complete generality .",
    "let @xmath3 be a graph and @xmath0 a function satisfying @xmath37 then reinforced random walk on @xmath3 with reinforcement function @xmath0 eventually gets stuck on a single edge with probability @xmath18 , under either of the following conditions    1 .",
    "@xmath0 is increasing , or 2 .",
    "@xmath3 contains no cycle of odd order .",
    "see limic @xcite and limic and tarrs @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured that neither condition is necessary , but clearly , the result is quite complete as is .",
    "let us now consider once - reinforced random walk , but let us add a parameter @xmath38 and examine the reinforcement function @xmath39 an exciting conjecture due to beffara & sidoravicius is that , say for the graph @xmath40 , @xmath41 , there is a _ phase transition _ in @xmath38 . for @xmath38",
    "very small the walk is essentially simple random walk . for @xmath38",
    "very large the walk looks like a man trapped in a balloon : it constantly jumps against the boundaries of the balloon , occasionally inflating it , but the balloon keeps its round shape , as it inflates .",
    "the `` balloon '' , of course , is the set of visited sites .",
    "in particular for @xmath41 there should be a phase transition between recurrence and transience .",
    "let us stress that @xmath38 does not depend on @xmath9 .",
    "it is not difficult to establish results if one first fixes @xmath9 and then makes @xmath38 very small or very large . in this case for @xmath42 one",
    "can directly check that the process is identical to simple random walk ( with high probability ) , while for @xmath43 the process gets stuck on its first edge .",
    "but the conjecture is that for a fixed @xmath38 there is a marked difference in behaviour as @xmath44 .",
    "some simulation results can be seen in figure [ fig : once ] .",
    "= 0.48    once - reinforced random walk , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    @xmath45    once - reinforced random walk , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    @xmath46    once - reinforced random walk , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    @xmath47    once - reinforced random walk , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    @xmath48    once - reinforced random walk , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    @xmath49    once - reinforced random walk , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    @xmath50    each simulation was done on a @xmath51 grid and stopped when the process reached the boundaries .",
    "the 2-dimensional case was chosen since it is easiest to depict , but one should probably caution that in fact it is not clear what is the true behaviour in 2 dimensions , even on a conjectural level .",
    "colour depicts the number of reinforced edge .",
    "this means that the second edge which is reinforced is given colour @xmath52 , not the second edge which is traversed ( colour change rate is not identical in the 6 images ) .",
    "the fractal - like colour patterns seen in @xmath47 are indicative of the process leaving holes all around and then going back to fill them at a macroscopically later time .",
    "presumably @xmath53 is quite close to the point of criticality where the processes of roughening and smoothing balance exactly .",
    "the case of large @xmath38 in this conjecture is related to a series of similar models .",
    "internal diffusion - limited aggregation is a process where the walker , upon reaching a new vertex , is transported to the starting point @xmath4 . for this model",
    "it is known since the early 90s that the set of visited vertices is spherical @xcite , with impressive improvements in the precision of the results achieved lately @xcite . a variation",
    "where , when the walker , upon reaching a new vertex is transported to a random vertex in the existing cluster also gives a ball @xcite .",
    "getting closer to once - reinforced random walk we may examine _ excited to the center_. in this model the walker , upon getting to a new vertex gets a small drift towards the center .",
    "less is known about this problem , basically only that the process is recurrent in any dimension , regardless of the strength of the drift [ unpublished , 2006 ] .",
    "once - reinforced has all the difficulties of excited to the center and more : there is no preferred direction and there is a phase transition .",
    "hence it seems quite challenging at this point .",
    "existing rigorous results on the model are on a tree @xcite , and it is not difficult to solve the one - dimensional case , but neither case exhibits a phase transition , so for now this phenomenon is beyond reach .",
    "let us close this comparison by returning to the simulation results above .",
    "as can be seen , the shapes for @xmath48 or @xmath54 are not that round .",
    "this is unlike internal diffusion - limited aggregation where even quite small simulations are very close to a ball .",
    "a similar phenomenon can be seen in simulations of excited to the center done by yadin .",
    "this is simply indicative that the boundary smoothing mechanism is far less efficient in these models .",
    "we now move to the main topic of this talk , linearly reinforced random walk , lrrw for short . naively one might conjecture that , since @xmath55 diverges so slowly , maybe the behaviour of lrrw is not that different from the behaviour of strongly reinforced random walk .",
    "let us start with a simple example that shows that this is not at all the case .",
    "the example will be a graph with @xmath56 vertices connected in a line , and @xmath4 being the middle vertex",
    ". the reinforcement function will be @xmath57 . with this weight ,",
    "the process is equivalent to the classic plya urn .",
    "recall that in the plya urn model one repeatedly takes out a ball , and then returns two balls of the same colour as the ball you took out . looking at the weights of the lrrw at time @xmath58 ( i.e.  the values of @xmath59 ) , and dividing them by @xmath52 , one gets a plya urn .",
    "let us recall plya s theorem @xcite=10.4 cm = 2.2 cm 8 0pt    [ thm : polya]at time @xmath9 ( i.e.  when the urn contains @xmath60 balls ) , the probability that it contains @xmath61 black balls is exactly @xmath62 , for any value of @xmath61 between @xmath18 and @xmath9 .",
    "assume inductively that the claim has been proved for @xmath63 .",
    "now , to get @xmath61 black balls at time @xmath9",
    "you need one of the following :    1 .",
    "have @xmath64 black balls at time @xmath63 and take a black ball out of the bin ; or 2 .",
    "have @xmath61 black balls at time @xmath63 and take a white ball out of the bin .",
    "the probability of ( 1 ) is @xmath65 where the term @xmath66 is our inductive assumption , and the term @xmath67 is the probability to pick a black ball when you have @xmath64 black balls out of a total of @xmath9 balls .",
    "this formula also holds for @xmath68 , though for a different reason : here the probability is zero since @xmath69 black balls are not allowed , and the formula indeed gives @xmath69 .",
    "a similar calculation shows that the probability of ( 2 ) is @xmath70 summing ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) gives @xmath71 and the induction is complete .",
    "thus we see that the picture is very different from that of strongly reinforced random walk .",
    "looking at strongly reinforced random walk at some very large time would give that with probability very close to @xmath18 , the walk visited one of the edges a very small number of times , and the other edge all the rest ( from symmetry each one gets probability close to @xmath72 ) .",
    "here this is not the case , typically each edge is visited a number of times proportional to @xmath9 . on the other hand",
    ", this is also very different from what we expect for , say , once - reinforced random walk .",
    "it is not difficult to analyze this explicitly and see that once - reinforced would have the number of visits to each edge at time @xmath9 being @xmath73 , with the random errors being of order @xmath74 .",
    "so we see that the linear case is quite special .",
    "0    the analogy to plya s urn works in a number of other cases .",
    "examine the graph @xmath75 .",
    "examine a single vertex .",
    "since there are no cycles , you know that when you leave your vertex through some edge @xmath8 , you are bound to return through @xmath8 , if you return at all .",
    "the other vertices can only effect you through preventing return , not in any other way .",
    "thus you can couple lrrw on @xmath75 to a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "plya urns .",
    "the same holds for any tree , except that you get multicoloured plya urns .",
    "but these are also well understood . using these ideas ,",
    "pemantle @xcite was able to analyze lrrw on regular trees .",
    "he showed that there is a phase transition in the initial weight @xmath38    [ thm : pmntl]let @xmath3 be a regular tree of degree @xmath76 , and let @xmath77 be the reinforcement function .",
    "then there exists an @xmath78 such that for @xmath79 lrrw is ( strongly ) recurrent , while for @xmath80 it is transient .",
    "here strong recurrence means that the expected time to return to your starting point is finite .",
    "this is significantly stronger than usual recurrence : infinite graphs ( like @xmath75 or @xmath81 ) are recurrent but not strongly so ( for @xmath75 this is the well - known `` gambler s ruin '' theorem ) . in a way it means that the process behaves like random walk on a _ finite _ graph",
    "again , compare to the case of once - reinforced random walk on a tree which is transient for any value of the parameter @xcite .",
    "theorem [ thm : pmntl ] shows that importance of the parameter @xmath38 , and from now on we will simply say `` lrrw with @xmath38 '' rather than the cumbersome `` lrrw with reinforcement function @xmath77 '' .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath38 has the opposite effect compared to once - reinforced random walk : there small @xmath38 gave random - walk - like behaviour , while here it is the large @xmath38 that give this .",
    "another case where the theory of urns is applicable is _ directed _ reinforced random walk .",
    "one modifies the definition of @xmath13 to count directed traversals i.e. @xmath82 and then again define @xmath83 by taking @xmath84 and normalizing it . here",
    "it is not important what graph one looks at , each vertex can be isolated and treated as a multicoloured urn independent of all others .",
    "nevertheless , this urn argument only reduces the model to a kind of _ random walk in random environment _ , a notorious problem in its own right .",
    "this was tackled on the graphs @xmath40 by enriquez and sabot @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there is no phase transition when @xmath85 , the walk is transient for any choice of @xmath38 .",
    "we will return to plya s urn later , but for now let us go back to general graphs .",
    "another way to understand why lrrw is special is that it has a property called _ partial exchangeability_. this means that for a given path , its probability depends on how many times each edge is visited , but not on the order in which these visits happen .",
    "figure [ fig : partial - exchangeability ]    shows two such paths in a triangle .",
    "both paths have length 4 , and both cross one edge twice and the other two edges once , but are different .",
    "the numbers in the figure are the probability of each traversal for lrrw with @xmath86 .",
    "the reader can verify that the numbers are not the same , but their product is @xmath87 indeed the numerators on the left are a permutation of the numerators on the right ; and ditto for the denominators .",
    "the general proof is the same :    lrrw is partially exchangeable .",
    "we may assume without loss of generality that the reinforcement function is @xmath88 for some @xmath89 .",
    "let @xmath90 be a path in the graph @xmath3 .",
    "then the probability @xmath91 that @xmath92 is the beginning of the lrrw path is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is of course the analog of @xmath13 above for the path @xmath90 i.e.  @xmath95 .",
    "now , if @xmath96 for some @xmath97 , then the numerators contain the terms @xmath38 , @xmath98 at the @xmath97 places where @xmath8 is an edge of @xmath90 .",
    "this is not specific to linear reinforcement .",
    "now assume that the vertex @xmath99 appears @xmath100 times in the path @xmath101 ( note that we do not count @xmath102 ) .",
    "then the denominators contain @xmath103 , @xmath104 at the @xmath100 places where @xmath105 .",
    "for @xmath106 you get a similar picture , except the denominators contain @xmath107 . in other words",
    "it does not matter at which order did @xmath90 traverse the edges coming out of @xmath108 , since each such traversal increases the total weight of the edges surrounding @xmath108 by @xmath18 ( and another @xmath18 is added when returning to the vertex ) .",
    "this is the point which is special to linear reinforcement .",
    "hence , if you know @xmath109 for all @xmath8 you can reconstruct both numerators and denominators up to a permutation ( this requires the observation that you can identify the last vertex of @xmath90 , since it is the only one with odd total number of appearances , or @xmath4 if no vertex has this property ) . thus you can calculate @xmath91 from @xmath94 , and the process is partially exchangeable .",
    "partial exchangeability is interesting because of the following theorem of diaconis & freedman @xcite    let @xmath110 be a random sequence of elements in some state space , which is recurrent",
    ". then @xmath20 is partially exchangeable if and only if it is a mixture of markov chains .",
    "here recurrent means that the sequence returns to its starting vertex with probability @xmath18 .",
    "this has to be specified as for general random sequences the various definitions of recurrence are not identical .",
    "in fact , the counterexamples in @xcite which show that recurrence is necessary consist of two states and a process that gets stuck in the second state .",
    "a mixture of markov chains means that there is some measure @xmath111 on the space of markov chains such that the probability of every event @xmath112 is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a markov chain and @xmath115 is the probability of @xmath112 under the markov chain @xmath114 .",
    "the same concept is known under the name of random walk in random environment .",
    "again , you first pick an environment @xmath114 randomly , then perform random walk on it .",
    "we already mentioned random walk in random environment when we discussed the directed case above .",
    "but there each vertex was independent , while in the general case this is typically not the case .",
    "we will not prove the theorem , but just make some remarks on its proof .",
    "recurrence is used to break the infinite process into blocks , from one visit of @xmath4 to the next .",
    "these blocks then turn out to be _ fully _ exchangeable , i.e.  any permutation has the same probability .",
    "this allows to apply de finetti s theorem which states that such a process is a mixture of i.i.d",
    ".  processes .",
    "de finetti s theorem itself is not difficult either , it is an application of krein - milman .",
    "the point to note here is that the proof is soft and abstract , without any explicit calculations .",
    "let us demonstrate the utility of this fact by applying it to plya s urn , i.e.  to lrrw on a line of length @xmath56 with @xmath116 .",
    "there is no question as to recurrence , since our walker returns to its starting point every 2 steps without failure .",
    "our random environment can only relate to the central vertex , so asking `` what is the random environment ? ''",
    "is equivalent to asking `` what is the probability to go left from the central vertex ? '' . in other words , there is only one parameter .",
    "let us denote it by @xmath117 .",
    "[ thm : polyaunif]the parameter @xmath117 defined above is uniform in @xmath118 $ ] .",
    "fix @xmath117 and examine the markov chain on a line of length @xmath56 which moves from the central vertex to the left vertex with probability @xmath117 and to the right vertex with probability @xmath119 .",
    "denote by @xmath120 the number of times the left edge was crossed by time @xmath9 . by the law of large numbers",
    "we know that @xmath121 the random walk in random environment tells us that for the measure @xmath111 that we seek , @xmath122 this holds for every measurable @xmath112 , but let us restrict our attention to intervals . by the explicit solution of plya s urn ( theorem [ thm : polya ] above ) , the left hand side is @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the lebesgue measure of @xmath112 .",
    "taking @xmath44 ( which can be done inside the integral as @xmath111 is a probability measure and the integrand is bounded ) gives @xmath125 since this holds for all intervals @xmath112 , we get that @xmath111 is uniform , as needed .    in other words ,",
    "the theorem of diaconis and freedman allows us to get from the `` static '' description of the plya urn we had before , a `` dynamic '' description which is fuller .",
    "we now know that plya s urn is equivalent , _ as a process _ , to choosing some number @xmath126 $ ] uniformly and then picking each time a black ball with probability @xmath117 and a white ball with probability @xmath119 .    in general graphs it proved to be a significant challenge to find an explicit formula for the environment , and",
    "this is what we turn to next .",
    "let us consider for a moment finite graphs . even a triangle would prove to be highly nontrivial ! lrrw is recurrent on any finite graph  this is not difficult to show , but we will skip it here .",
    "the theorem of diaconis & freedman promises us that _ some _ random environment exists such that lrrw is equivalent to random walk in the environment .",
    "but what is it ?",
    "it turns out there is a formula for it , known fondly as the `` magic formula '' .",
    "the history of its discovery is complicated and the reader would be best served by reading about it in detail in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the environment is always _ reversible _",
    "( a fact which does not follow from diaconis & freedman ) .",
    "this means that there is a ( random ) weight function @xmath127 where @xmath112 is the set of edges of @xmath3 such that the probability to go from @xmath20 to @xmath24 is @xmath128 it is common to denote the denominator by @xmath129 and we shall do so below .",
    "reversibility is perhaps the most important property a markov chain may or may not possess .",
    "most notably a reversible markov chain gives rise to a _ self - adjoint _ operator ( on @xmath130 with the weight being @xmath114 ) which is amenably to spectral analysis .",
    "now , @xmath114 is not unique since multiplying @xmath114 by a constant gives rise to exactly the same markov chain .",
    "so we need to normalize and we normalize so that @xmath131 . for completeness ,",
    "let us state the magic formula for non - constant initial weights , i.e.  assume for every edge @xmath8 there is some @xmath132 and the transition probabilities at time @xmath9 are @xmath133 , normalized .",
    "the magic formula is then :    let @xmath134 be a finite graph .",
    "examine lrrw on @xmath3 , starting from @xmath4 with initial weights @xmath132 , and let @xmath111 be the corresponding random environment . then the density of @xmath111 at a given @xmath114 is given by @xmath135 where the sum inside the square root is a sum over all spanning trees of @xmath3 ; where @xmath136 is a normalization constant ; and where @xmath137 .",
    "the most problematic term is the sum over trees , as it introduces long - range dependencies . by the matrix - tree theorem",
    "this sum can be written as a determinant , but that does not simplify the formula significantly .    as an exercise , let us analyse plya s urn again :    [ second proof of theorem [ thm : polyaunif ] ] we use the magic formula .",
    "all @xmath138 , @xmath139 and for @xmath99 ( i.e.  one of the side vertices ) , @xmath140 .",
    "since the normalization is @xmath141 , we have @xmath142 .",
    "denote the weight of the left edge by @xmath117 , so for one of the side vertices @xmath143 while for the other it is @xmath119 .",
    "all in all this gives @xmath144 the expression inside the square root is so simple because a line graph has exactly one spanning tree ( the graph itself ) , so the sum is only over one term .",
    "everything cancels and we get that the density is @xmath145 , which of course means that @xmath146 , proving the theorem .    throughout the last decade the magic formula stood in the center of research on lrrw .",
    "even the case of the ladder was not so easy , and was done in @xcite .",
    "the next result achieved was a tightness result that allowed to show that lrrw is always equivalent to a random walk in random environment , even in the transient case ( which is not covered by diaconis & freedman ) @xcite .",
    "the most impressive result , also due to merkl & rolles @xcite , was the proof that a certain two - dimensional graph is recurrent . a conjecture that goes back to the 80s",
    "@xcite is that lrrw on @xmath81 is recurrent , at least for @xmath38 sufficiently small .",
    "merkl & rolles got quite close , but their proofs required to replace each edge by a line of length 130 or more .    around the same period a surprising connection to certain quantum models appeared , a topic we will discuss next .",
    "the hyperbolic sigma model has its roots in physics . as some of the readers ( and , frankly",
    ", the author ) may not be familiar with the necessary background , we will be short and vague .",
    "hopefully the description will still be useful to some .",
    "our starting point is supersymmetry .",
    "supersymmetry started its life as a branch of particle physics that postulated that each of the known particles has a partner ( a `` superpartner '' ) which is similar in most aspects , but the superpartner of a fermion is a boson and vice versa .",
    "the existence of these particles leads to cancellations which would solve several theoretical problems with the current model .",
    "these superpartners were never found in particle accelerators , but the mathematics of these cancellations turned out to be very fruitful .",
    "one potential application of supersymmetry to problems which have nothing to do with bosons or fermions is the wegner - efetov approach to random matrices and to certain disordered quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the titular hyperbolic sigma model captures some of the mathematical difficulties of this approach , and , conjecturally , most of the phenomenology .",
    "it has been studied by disertori , spencer & zirnbauer @xcite .",
    "the model , roughly , is as follows .",
    "we are looking at functions @xmath147 from the vertices of our graph ( say @xmath40 ) into hyperbolic space .",
    "the action ( or energy ) @xmath148 is a sum over the edges of some interaction _ which respects the symmetries of the hyperbolic space_. then each @xmath147 is given probability density proportional to @xmath149 where @xmath150 is a parameter which is analogous to the initial weights @xmath38 in lrrw .    the approach taken in @xcite to tackle",
    "the hyperbolic sigma model is to make a change of variable in the hyperbolic plane ( change to the so - called horospherical coordinates ) and then integrate some of the variables .",
    "the result was a sigma model with values in @xmath151 but with a much more complicated interaction term , which included a determinant very similar to the one appearing in the magic formula .",
    "this caused significant curiosity but for a few years it was not clear whether the similarity is coincidental or not .",
    "this mystery was solved in november 2011 .",
    "it was sabot and tarrs who managed to make the connection between lrrw and the hyperbolic sigma model rigorous @xcite .",
    "they investigated a variation on lrrw called the vertex - reinforced jump process , defined in continuous time . on the one hand",
    "the vertex - reinforced jump process has a random walk in random environment representation with the density of each environment _ identical _ to the formulas that appear in the hyperbolic sigma model .",
    "this allowed them to harness the results of @xcite to show that the vertex - reinforced jump process is recurrent for small @xmath38 in any graph ( the jump process has a parameter which acts analogously to @xmath38 for lrrw ) . on the other hand",
    ", they showed that lrrw is given by a vertex - reinforced jump process with random weights .",
    "thus , after some modification of the techniques of @xcite to work with different , unbounded @xmath150 in different edges , they were able to show :    for every graph @xmath3 there exists some @xmath152 such that lrrw is recurrent for all @xmath153 .",
    "simultaneously , with angel and crawford , we arrived at the same result @xcite .",
    "our approach was completely different and did not use the magic formula at all .",
    "the basic idea is very simple .",
    "[ basic idea of the proof]examine some edge @xmath154 and assume you have traversed @xmath8 for the first time from @xmath20 to @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath0 be the edge through which you arrived into @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath38 is extremely small , then upon arriving to @xmath20 you see one edge , @xmath0 , with weight @xmath155 , and all the others with weight @xmath38 .",
    "hence you are very likely to return via @xmath0 .",
    "this will repeat on the second , third etc .",
    "visit to @xmath20 . at each time , because @xmath0 has much larger weight than @xmath8 ( its weight is even increasing , but we will not use that ) , it will choose to exit @xmath20 through @xmath0 multiple times until finally exiting through @xmath8 .",
    "denote the number of times it exited through @xmath0 before the first exit through @xmath8 by @xmath13 .",
    "we now recall that the process is also a random walk in random environment .",
    "the environment might be complicated , but we have earned a bit of information about it . we know that the walker exited the vertex @xmath20 @xmath13 times through @xmath0 before the first time it exited through @xmath8 .",
    "this must mean that the weight of @xmath0 is approximately @xmath13 times larger than that of @xmath8 !",
    "in other words , we see that the weight of edges decays exponentially in the `` first entrance distance '' , i.e.  if we define @xmath156 as the edge through which we entered the other vertex of @xmath0 , @xmath157 as the edge through which we entered the other vertex of @xmath156 etc . , we finally reach @xmath158",
    ". then the argument says that the weight of @xmath8 should decay exponentially in @xmath159 .",
    "comparing to the approach of disertori - spencer - sabot - tarrs , our approach is much softer , and has almost no explicit calculations .",
    "we rely on the existence of a random walk in random environment representation , i.e.  on the theorem of diaconis & freedman , but that too , as explained above , is a soft result .    trying to formalize this leads to some minor technical difficulties .",
    "the first is that , to get exponential decay , different edge ratios need to be independent .",
    "however , different edges are not independent , because the `` first entrance path '' is a global property which introduces dependencies between all quantities . to tackle this difficulty we use a somewhat brutish approach and simply count over all such paths , i.e. write",
    "@xmath160 this allows to just fix two edges @xmath8 and @xmath0 sharing a vertex @xmath20 , and define a variable as in the basic idea .",
    "these variables ( call them @xmath161 ) are independent and have expectation @xmath162 .",
    "thus we argue , very roughly , as follows @xmath163 the first equality is because under the event that @xmath90 really is the first entrance path , @xmath164 is really the product of the @xmath161 along @xmath90 .",
    "the inequality that follows comes from just throwing this event away .",
    "this seems very wasteful , but look at the final result : we show that the expectation is exponentially small , and not only that , we can make the exponent base as small as we want by reducing @xmath38 .",
    "so losing a fixed exponential term by counting over the @xmath90 is something that our approach can sustain .",
    "the third step in ( [ eq : wr ] ) is simply independence , and the fourth is the estimate that came from the `` basic idea '' sketch above .",
    "another technical difficulty that might be worth mentioning is that , even though the weights typically decrease along the first entrance path , sometimes they increase .",
    "once you incorporate this phenomenon into the basic sketch , you see that the @xmath161 , despite being typically @xmath165 , in fact have infinite expectation .",
    "we solve this by taking everything to some small fixed power ( @xmath166 worked ) .",
    "thus ( [ eq : wr ] ) as written is false , and what we actually prove is @xmath167 returning to our favourite example , plya s urn , we see that the phenomenon is real : the ratio between the weights of the two edges has no first moment .",
    "so some power must appear in the formulation of the result , though @xmath166 is not optimal .",
    "with these two problems solved , we were able to show the exponential decay of weights .",
    "let us state this formally :    let @xmath3 be a graph with all degrees bounded by @xmath168 .",
    "then there exists @xmath169 such that for all @xmath170 , @xmath171",
    "the next step to understand the phase transition is to understand the transient regime . using our techniques we were able to show the existence of a transient regime on any non - amenable graph . but getting to @xmath40 seems to require a new idea .",
    "next one would like to show that the phase transition is unique , namely that there is some @xmath78 such where the process moves from recurrence to transience , and not , say , that the process switches from recurrence to transience and back a few times before finally becoming transient for high enough @xmath38 .",
    "in many models proving this kind of fact requires monotonicity , but there are also other approaches , so e.g.  @xcite .",
    "there are also many other models we would like to know similar results .",
    "we already covered other reinforced walks , but the connection to the hyperbolic sigma models suggests many more questions .",
    "are there other sigma models where one can get an interacting representation for random walk on the generated field ?",
    "all - in - all this is an exciting and fast - moving field , with a lot more to understand .",
