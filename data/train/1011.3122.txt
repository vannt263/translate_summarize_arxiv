    "leptogenesis  @xcite is often studied in parametric regimes where the masses of the right - handed neutrinos are either hierarchical or degenerate .",
    "the hierarchical limit is particularly useful for gaining valuable analytical insights into the connections between leptogenesis and the observed neutrino oscillations  @xcite . to be specific ,",
    "we discuss here the simple case of two right - handed neutrinos @xmath0 with masses @xmath1 and yukawa couplings @xmath2 to the higgs and lepton doublets , _",
    "i.e. _ a model as specified in ref .",
    "the key simplification in the hierarchical limit , @xmath3 , is that the evolution of the lepton asymmetry during leptogenesis as a function of @xmath4 depends up to a proportionality factor only on the ratio @xmath5 , which characterises the washout strength . here , @xmath6 is the temperature and @xmath7 is the planck mass .",
    "the remaining proportionality factor characterising the amount of @xmath8 violation is @xmath9m_1/m_2 $ ] , up to corrections of order @xmath10 , which one neglects in the hierarchical limit . on the other hand ,",
    "mass - degenerate right - handed neutrinos lead to resonant leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a phenomenologically attractive scenario , since the decay asymmetry is enhanced , which allows for lower temperatures at which leptogenesis takes place .",
    "thus , the production of unwanted relics , most notoriously of gravitinos within supersymmetric models  @xcite , along with the lepton asymmetry asymmetry can be avoided",
    ". a lower energy scale might also give rise to new experimentally accessible signals connected with leptogenesis , see _",
    "e.g. _  @xcite .    however , the origin of the masses of the right - handed neutrinos is yet unknown and their masses may well be neither hierarchical nor degenerate .",
    "when the hierarchical limit @xmath3 no longer applies , it is well known that the decay asymmetry of @xmath11 is not simply proportional to @xmath12 with negligible corrections , as can be verified by inspection of the vertex and wave - function contributions to the decay asymmetry of @xmath11  @xcite . in the finite - temperature background",
    ", there are additional corrections due to new cuts . while in the vacuum background",
    ", the @xmath8-violating contribution from the vertex function arises exclusively from the cut through @xmath13 , where the internal lepton and higgs boson are on - shell , at finite temperature also the two other possible cuts through @xmath14 or @xmath15 in the vertex diagram contribute , _ cf .",
    "_ figure  [ fig : doublediamond ]  ( b ) .",
    "this is because in the finite - temperature background , the cut - particles do not need to correspond to stimulated ( suppressed ) emission processes for bosons ( fermions ) , but they can also correspond to absorption processes of particles from the plasma . the presence of these cut contributions has been mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , by now , neither analytical expressions for these terms have been derived nor have these been evaluated numerically in order to compute effective decay asymmetries or the resulting lepton asymmetry .",
    "these are the main goals of the present work .",
    "the new cut contributions are a finite density effect , and a powerful method of describing out - of - equilibrium field theory is given by the schwinger - keldysh closed - time - path ( ctp ) formalism  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been applied to leptogenesis and has resulted in some recent activity which we build upon within the present work  @xcite .",
    "main advantages of the ctp approach to leptogenesis over the conventional description by semi - classical boltzmann equations may be seen in the absence of the need of an explicit subtraction procedure for real intermediate states ( ris )  @xcite and in the systematic treatment of finite - density corrections .    within the ctp approach",
    ", the vertex diagram in figure  [ fig : doublediamond ]  ( b ) appears as a subdiagram in the self - energy figure  [ fig : doublediamond ]  ( a ) , which is a contribution to the lepton self - energy .",
    "this self - energy in turn enters the collision term of the kadanoff - baym equation for the lepton , that can be reduced to a kinetic equation which describes the gain and the loss and therefore the time evolution of the lepton number density . in order to simplify the collision term to a manageable form , it is useful to substitute equilibrium propagators for @xmath16 and @xmath17 and to employ kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) relations .",
    "the present work relies strongly on ref .",
    "@xcite , where these simplification strategies are explained and justified in detail and where also many definitions and quantities that we use here are introduced .",
    "an additional simplifying assumption that we introduce here , but that will not hold true in general , is that also @xmath18 is maintained in equilibrium ( _ e.g. _ through interactions with an additional lepton flavour ) , such that @xmath11 is the only out - of - equilibrium particle .",
    "we leave a study of the situation where more than one of the right - handed neutrinos deviates from equilibrium to future work .",
    "provided the initial distribution function for @xmath11 is thermal , as we assume in the present work , the main contributions to the lepton asymmetry occur at times when the value of @xmath4 is in the range of around one up to a few , for an in - detail discussion , see ref .",
    "this is because at these temperatures , @xmath11 becomes non - relativistic and therefore deviate from equilibrium . as a consequence , we anticipate the new cuts to be important under the following conditions :    * since the effect is due to the finite densities , @xmath19 should not be much larger than @xmath20 , because otherwise the new contributions are maxwell - suppressed , just as the equilibrium distribution functions for energies of order @xmath19 much larger than @xmath6 .",
    "* the new effects will be most pronounced in case leptogenesis occurs at comparably low values for @xmath21 , when it is around one .",
    "this is the case in the transitional regime between strong and weak washout .",
    "in such a situation , the finite density effects that include the contributions from the new cuts , take their largest relevance . * a loophole to these arguments are situations where @xmath22 .",
    "( we denote within this work by @xmath11 the neutrino that deviates from equilibrium , whereas @xmath18 is assumed to be very close to equilibrium at the time relevant for leptogenesis .",
    "this definition differs from what is commonly used in the literature , where @xmath11 corresponds to the lightest right - handed neutrino , _ cf .",
    "_ refs  @xcite . in this case , the finite density effects from the @xmath18 are also important when leptogenesis occurs at larger values of @xmath21 , since the distribution of @xmath18 can still be unsuppressed .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : vertex ] , we give the expressions for the @xmath8-violating source terms that bias the lepton number and that are valid for finite ratios of @xmath12 . for the standard cut through @xmath23 ,",
    "we quote the result from ref .",
    "@xcite , while for the new cuts through @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , we derive new expressions . in section  [ sec : examples ] , we present the first numerical results for the cut through @xmath23 at finite @xmath12 and finite density , as well as for the new cuts through @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we first define and evaluate expressions for the effective @xmath8 violation for several ratios of @xmath12",
    ". then , we solve the kinetic equations for the lepton asymmetry for the same values of @xmath12 and specific illustrative choices of @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",

    "these are the cut propagators . as a consequence of this ,",
    "the third propagator is off shell .",
    "since the @xmath55 and @xmath56 propagators are purely on shell , it follows that only terms where the off - shell propagator is of the time - ordered @xmath6 or anti - time - ordered @xmath57 type contribute .",
    "the collision term  ( [ collision : kb ] ) can therefore be split into the portions @xmath58 where the superscripts indicate through which two of the loop propagators in the vertex correction the cut goes .",
    "likewise , we decompose the vertex contribution to the source term as @xmath59    within the present work , we make the simplifying assumption that @xmath18 is in thermal equilibrium at all times , whereas @xmath11 is in equilibrium initially but then deviates from equilibrium when it becomes non - relativistic .",
    "we note that in general , both @xmath11 and @xmath18 will deviate from equilibrium at the same time .",
    "in fact , situations are conceivable where the initial abundance of @xmath18 is zero and @xmath27 is so small that @xmath18 does not equilibrate before becoming non - relativistic .",
    "therefore , the equilibrium deviation of @xmath18 can be large when compared to @xmath11 , and inverse decays of @xmath18 may largely enhance the lepton asymmetry .",
    "for now , leave this interesting possibility for future work and note that @xmath18 may be maintained in equilibrium by a stronger coupling to a different lepton flavour within which no asymmetry is produced .",

    "therefore , the effect of the new contributions is more relevant if it extends to larger values of @xmath21 .",
    "second , we remark that that for small @xmath21 , finite temperature effects should become relevant , which we do not take into account within the present work .",
    "the most important correction is the contribution of the top quarks to the debye mass - square of the higgs boson , @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the top - quark yukawa coupling .",
    "besides , also the @xmath122 gauge couplings of the higgs bosons and the leptons are of relevance .",
    "a full evaluation of these finite - temperature effects in the context of leptogenesis has not been performed yet , but it would be of great importance for obtaining quantitatively accurate results in models where asymmetries generated at values of @xmath21 that are somewhat smaller than one are relevant .",
    "moreover , the size of the top - quark yukawa coupling at the energy scale of leptogenesis depends due to running on the mass of the higgs boson , which is yet unknown . for the present discussion ,",
    "we therefore keep in mind that for the contributions that are generated at @xmath123 , we have to anticipate an inaccuracy of order one .",
    "c ( a ) : @xmath124 +    c ( b ) : @xmath125 +     +    c ( c ) : @xmath126 +    c ( d ) : @xmath127 +    in figure  [ fig : epseff ] , the ratios  ( [ ratio : v ] ) and  ( [ ratio : full ] ) are plotted for several values of @xmath12 .",
    "the main features for each of the particular values can be summarised as follows :    * for @xmath124 , the hierarchical limit is of course not a good approximation .",
    "the total asymmetry is dominated by the resonantly enhanced contribution @xmath115 . as a consequence of this ,",
    "@xmath128 is much larger than one .",
    "since the distribution of @xmath18 is only very weakly thermally suppressed when compared to @xmath11 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 agree only for comparably large values of @xmath21 . * for @xmath125",

    "we note that the very substantial deviation of @xmath129 from @xmath130 for very small values of @xmath21 needs to be interpreted with care in the light of the thermal corrections mentioned above . * for @xmath126 , the results obtained from the hierarchical limit @xmath131 and the source @xmath129 with the standard cuts only are now in good agreement , as anticipated .",
    "this serves also as a consistency check for our numerical evaluation of @xmath130 in the form of a multi - dimensional integral as compared to @xmath116 through the one - dimensional integral given in ref .",
    "the new cut contributions become suppressed for even smaller values of @xmath21 along with the stronger maxwell suppression of @xmath18 .",
    "the comment regarding scenario  ( b ) , that the deviations that originate for values @xmath132 need to be interpreted with care due to thermal corrections , is even more relevant for the present case . * in this scenario , @xmath127 .",
    "since @xmath18 is now lighter than @xmath11 , the coupling @xmath27 must be chosen sufficiently small , such that @xmath18 does not equilibrate and wash out the lepton asymmetry before it becomes non - relativistic and maxwell suppressed .",

    "in this situation , sizable contributions to the final lepton asymmetry are generated for @xmath109 , such that the effects of the new cuts becomes relevant .",
    "we choose for @xmath0 thermal initial conditions . in the early universe",
    ", these may be established through interactions via heavy gauge bosons that freeze out at times before leptogenesis takes place .",
    "we assume that @xmath18 is maintained in equilibrium due to a yukawa coupling with an additional lepton flavour , within which no asymmetry is produced .",
    "the coupling @xmath27 is chosen smaller than @xmath26 , such that washout effects from inverse decays of @xmath18 are negligible .",
    "( explicitly , for the scenarios with @xmath108 , the largest error from washout through @xmath27 occurs for @xmath124 .",
    "since the thermal suppression of @xmath18 compared to @xmath11 is very small in this case and we have chosen @xmath134 , we expect that the washout is underestimated by 20% .",
    "the accuracy improves for larger ratios of @xmath108 due to the thermal suppression of @xmath18 and its irrelevance for washout ) .",
    "while this appears as a somewhat special setup , we note that even when @xmath27 is large , the vector of couplings of @xmath18 to the various left - handed lepton flavours defines a particular linear combination @xmath135 of leptons that are washed out through inverse decays of @xmath18 .",
    "this linear combination can in general be linearly independent of the linear combination @xmath16 within which the lepton asymmetry through decays and inverse decays of @xmath11 is produced .",

    "the new cuts give rise to relative corrections at the 10% level .",
    "note however that the absolute correction is larger when compared to scenarios ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the relative correction is marginalised due to the resonant enhancement of @xmath115 . * for @xmath125 , there are sizable deviations of the full result from the result with the cut through @xmath13 only , that arise in the region @xmath109 . * for @xmath126 ,",
    "the new contributions are of importance for smaller values of @xmath21 when compared to scenarios ( a ) and ( b ) . in the light of the thermal corrections that we anticipate to be important for small values of @xmath21 ,",
    "the quantitative result needs to be interpreted with care .",

    "the contribution to the @xmath8-asymmetry is rendered ineffective because the separation between the resonances of the lepton quasi - particles is well within their overlap due to the finite widths .",

    "second , the effect is most pronounced in scenarios where a sizable amount of the asymmetry is produced for comparably small values of @xmath21 , as it is the case for the transitional regime between weak and strong washout . as a loophole , we find that the largest effects arise within a somewhat unconventional scenario with @xmath110 , since in this situation the new cuts are important throughout the time of the out - of - equilibrium decays of @xmath11",
    ". therefore , relevant contributions from the new cuts also result for larger values of @xmath21 .",
    "however , in regard of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that decay asymmetries from the heavier singlet neutrinos generically survive subsequent washout , such a scenario may not only appear as a mere loophole .",
    "provided the reheat temperature is large enough to produce the heavier singlet neutrino in the early universe , the present work implies that a large contribution to the baryon asymmetry of the universe generically results from the new cuts .",

    "@xcite appeared , where non - standard cuts are discussed as well .",
    "since finite density effects are neglected , it is found there that the new cuts are only allowed within certain scattering processes .",
    "more precisely , in order to satisfy the kinematic thresholds for the presence of cut contributions in the vacuum , diagrams with additional radiation of standard model particles are considered . note that if the resulting amplitudes were substituted as source terms into the kinetic equations for the lepton asymmetry , they would be subject to the same maxwell suppression that occurs also in the present case for @xmath87 .",
    "however , compared to the new source terms that we have derived in the present work , the terms discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite are subject to further suppression because of the insertion of additional coupling constants .      * the results  ( [ s : ell ] ) and",

    "we expect the new cut contributions to be of crucial importance for phenomenological studies where it is assumed that @xmath110 , such as refs .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath18 may or may not be in equilibrium .",
    "( note the different definitions of @xmath0 in these works ) .",

    "we expect the new cuts still to be important in such a situation , but the interpretations of the particular cut particles in terms of absorption processes may change to emissions and vice versa . * in the present work , we have restricted ourselves to compute the lepton asymmetries for thermal initial conditions for @xmath0 .",
    "this is in part motivated by the fact that for a vanishing initial density of @xmath11 , the final asymmetry is a remainder of an incomplete cancellation of a contribution that is created initially at small @xmath21 , when @xmath11 is underabundant , and an opposite one through later decays when @xmath21 is larger and @xmath11 overabundant .",
    "the fact that the cancellation is incomplete is because the opposite asymmetries are affected differently by the washout , since they occur at different temperatures . in order to obtain a quantitatively reliable result for the remaining asymmetry , a rather accurate prediction of the asymmetry that is created through inverse decays at small",
    "@xmath21 is necessary . due to the uncertainties because of thermal corrections , that we have emphasised in this paper ,",
    "such an accurate prediction is presently not available .",
    "the situation somewhat improves for the thermal initial conditions that we consider within the present work , because @xmath11 is always overabundant and the produced asymmetry is therefore of the same sign for all values of @xmath21 .    in regard of these points ,",
    "we briefly comment on possible technical improvements that may prove very useful in order to increase the accuracy of the predictions for leptogenesis from the new cuts as well as from the standard cuts",
    ". it would be particularly interesting , if the following issues were addressed :    * as it should be clear from the discussions within this paper , the uncertainties due to thermal corrections for small @xmath21 are problematic for the predictivity of the new cut contributions as well as more generically for leptogenesis in the weak washout regime , in particular for vanishing initial conditions for @xmath11 . in order to resolve this issue ,",
    "a calculation of the rates @xmath186 for temperatures that are of order @xmath20 or larger is necessary .",
    "both , the tree - level rates as well as the @xmath8-violating loop effects need to be calculated . for that purpose ,",

    "furthermore , the finite widths of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which are much larger than for @xmath11 and have been neglected so far , need to be taken into account in a future calculation .    considering these comments and a number of related papers",

    "<S> for standard leptogenesis from the decay of singlet right - handed neutrinos , we derive source terms for the lepton asymmetry that are present in a finite density background but absent in the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> these arise from cuts through the vertex correction to the decay asymmetry , where in the loop either the higgs boson and the right - handed neutrino or the left - handed lepton and the right - handed neutrino are simultaneously on shell . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the source terms numerically and use them to calculate the lepton asymmetry for illustrative points in parameter space , where we consider only two right - handed neutrinos for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> compared to calculations where only the standard cut through the propagators of left - handed lepton and higgs boson is included , sizable corrections arise when the masses of the right - handed neutrinos are of the same order , but the new sources are found to be most relevant when the decaying right - handed neutrino is heavier than the one in the loop . in that situation , they can yield the dominant contribution to the lepton asymmetry .     </S>",
