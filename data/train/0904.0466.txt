    "understanding the phase structure and the critical properties of strongly interacting matter is one of the central problems addressed in studies of qcd thermodynamics .",
    "lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) calculations at finite temperature show a clear separation between the confined ( hadronic ) and deconfined ( quark - gluon plasma ) phases @xcite .",
    "universality arguments imply that two - flavor qcd exhibits a second order chiral phase transition belonging to the same universality class as the @xmath1 spin system in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the long - range properties of the chiral phase transition can be explored within effective models of the same universality class , independent of the specific dynamics .",
    "one such model is the chiral quark - meson model , which often is used as an effective realization of the low - energy sector of qcd @xcite .",
    "thus , by studying the thermodynamics of this model near the phase transition , one can explore the leading singularities of thermodynamic quantities in two - flavor qcd at the second order chiral phase transition .",
    "in other words , we can find the universal properties of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking at finite temperature and/or density .",
    "however , at this point we stress that a description of the qcd phase transition within effective models is subject to limitations .",
    "first , in chiral effective models one can not address the deconfinement phenomenon in qcd and second , one can not obtain quantitative information on the thermodynamics outside the chiral critical region .",
    "more generally , non - universal quantities depend on the specific dynamics of the theory and can therefore not be computed reliably within effective models .    as a rule , phase transitions and critical phenomena",
    "are related with singular behavior of some susceptibility which in turn provide a measure of the fluctuations of a physical quantity . at a second order phase transition ,",
    "there are long - range critical correlations that appear due to the presence of massless modes .",
    "the long - range correlations imply divergent susceptibilities and consequently large fluctuations .    in the mean field approximation , which is often used to describe the chiral phase transition @xcite , one fails to obtain a quantitatively correct description of critical phenomena , since the influence of fluctuations and non - perturbative effects near the phase transition are neglected .",
    "however , methods based on the renormalization group ( rg ) can account for both of these important effects ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of the rg method is that it can describe physics across different momentum scales . in particular , within the rg framework one can capture the dynamics of the long - range fluctuations near the critical point .",
    "wilsonian rg techniques , such as the functional renormalization group ( frg ) , are particularly useful in describing phase transitions @xcite .",
    "one of the important results of rg theory is that it provides a rationale for universality , i.e. , the fact that models can be grouped into universality classes that , depending only on the dimension of the system and the symmetry of the order parameter , show the same critical behavior .",
    "in this paper we use the frg method in the quark ",
    "meson model to explore the universal properties of the chiral phase transition .",
    "this model has been studied using different rg approaches  @xcite both in vacuum as well as in medium , at finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "various critical exponents have also been computed  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we go beyond previous rg studies of this model .",
    "we analyze the critical region in the broken and in the symmetric phase close to the critical point and discuss the scaling functions for different physical quantities as well as the magnetic equation of state @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we compute the critical exponents for the order parameter and its transverse and longitudinal susceptibilities as well as for the correlation lengths .",
    "we also calculate the effective critical exponents  @xcite in the presence of the chiral symmetry breaking field .",
    "finally , we explore the scaling behavior of different ratios of susceptibilities and the order parameter @xcite .",
    "we also show that within the frg method , with a suitable truncation of the frg flow equations , the quark - meson model exhibits a universal behavior that is in quantitative agreement with that recently found in lattice calculations of the @xmath1 spin system in three dimensions  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : crit ] we discuss the universal scaling properties of various physical quantities and extract their critical exponents . in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we summarize our results and discuss their relevance .",
    "we employ the chiral quark  meson model to explore the scaling properties and the critical equation of state within the frg method .",
    "this model is relevant for studying strongly interacting hot and dense matter with two degenerate light ",
    "quark flavors , since it is expected to belong to the same universality class as qcd at the chiral phase transition .",
    "the chiral quark - meson model represents an effective low - energy realization for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking at the intermediate momentum scale @xmath2 gev .",
    "one can view this model as an effective model of qcd , where the gluon degrees of freedom have been integrated out .",

    "the frg is an important tool for addressing nonperturbative problems within quantum field theory .",

    "the fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote bosonic and fermionic fields , respectively .    the effective average action @xmath20 governs the dynamics of a theory at the momentum scale @xmath21 and interpolates between the bare action @xmath27 and the full quantum effective action @xmath28 .",
    "the regulator function @xmath29 , which suppresses the small momentum modes , is to some extent arbitrary .",
    "the derivative of this function @xmath30 is peaked at the scale @xmath21 and thus implements the wilsonian idea of successively integrating out shells in momentum space .",

    "where the field @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 and the fermionic field @xmath26 carries two flavors corresponding to the up and down quarks .",
    "the matrix @xmath34 is the euclidean analogue of @xmath35 .    in the following we",
    "assume that each spectral function is dominated by a pole , corresponding to a quasiparticle .",
    "furthermore , we neglect the wavefunction renormalization for both the bosonic and fermionic fields ( @xmath36 ) , i.e. the anomalous dimension is set to zero .",
    "thus , changes of quasiparticle properties in the medium are accounted for , but the fragmentation of singel - particle strength is ignored .",
    "finally , we neglect the scale dependence of the yukawa coupling @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : trunc ] ) .",
    "consequently , the only scale dependence we are left with is that of the potential @xmath38 .",
    "this approximation to the average effective action @xmath20 in ( [ eq : trunc ] ) corresponds to the leading order derivative expansion , which is obtained as the leading term in a systematic expansion in powers of derivatives of the fields . for uniform field configurations ,",
    "the average effective action @xmath20 evaluated in this approximation is proportional to the effective potential @xmath39 , since @xmath40 the leading order derivative expansion offers a relatively transparent framework , which nonetheless yields a very useful description of the critical fluctuations near a phase transition .",
    "in addition to defining the form of the effective action , one also needs to specify the regulator functions @xmath29 . if suitably chosen , the momentum integration is both infrared and ultraviolet finite , leading to a numerically stable solution of the flow equations .",
    "we use the so called optimized regulator functions  @xcite , @xmath41 for bosons and @xmath42 for fermions . such regulator functions in general lead to a stabilization of the rg flow and an improved convergence towards the physical theory  @xcite .",
    "due to the theta function , the regulator acts as a momentum - dependent mass term for all modes with @xmath43 .      in the previous section",
    "we have introduced the basic concepts of frg . in the following",
    "we will use this method to find the nonperturbative thermodynamic potential at finite temperature and density .",
    "we treat bosons and fermions in thermal equilibrium in the standard imaginary time formalism . in thermal equilibrium",
    "the ( fermion ) boson fields satisfy ( anti- ) periodic boundary conditions in the euclidean time direction with periodicity @xmath44 .",
    "the momentum integration is replaced by a matsubara sum as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 for bosons and fermions , respectively .",
    "we employ a modified form of the optimized regulator , where the euclidean 4-momentum squared @xmath47 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : brb ] ) and ( [ eq : brf ] ) is replaced by the 3-momentum squared @xmath48 .",
    "thus , for bosons we use  @xcite @xmath49 the finite quark chemical potential @xmath50 is introduced by the following substitution of the time derivative @xmath51 in the fermionic part of the effective action ( [ eq : trunc ] ) . at finite @xmath50 , the fermionic regulator function is then of the form @xmath52 clearly , the modified regulators are invariant only under spatial rotations of the momentum @xmath53 in a particular frame , but not under euclidean rotations involving the imaginary time direction .",
    "however , this is not a crucial issue in calculations at finite @xmath54 and @xmath50 , where the heat bath defines a preferred frame .",
    "furthermore , the euclidean invariant form leads to various difficulties , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "a great advantage of the regulators ( [ eq : brb2 ] ) and ( [ eq : brf2 ] ) is that , in the quasiparticle approximation , the matsubara sums for the one - loop diagrams are identical to those appearing in a free theory .",
    "thus , with the regulators ( [ eq : brb2 ] ) and ( [ eq : brf2 ] ) one obtains the following flow equation for the thermodynamic potential density ( @xmath55 )    @xmath56,\\ ] ]    where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the bosonic and fermionic distribution functions @xmath59 @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the pion and sigma energies , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the first and the second derivatives of the thermodynamic potential with the explicit symmetry breaking term removed , @xmath64 , with respect to @xmath32 and @xmath65 the quark energy . finally , the quark degeneracy is given by @xmath66 .",
    "the flow equation ( [ eq : frg_flow ] ) is identical to the one obtained within the proper time renormalization group ( ptrg ) scheme  @xcite .",

    "thus , for @xmath73 , i.e. , for an explicitly broken symmetry , we find @xmath74 which relates the coupling @xmath75 and the expectation value of the scalar field @xmath76 .",
