    "graph coloring is one of the most challengeable and practical topics in combinatorics .",
    "a proper ( vertex ) coloring is an assignment of colors to each vertex of a graph such that no edge connects two identically colored vertices .",
    "the smallest number of colors needed for proper coloring of a graph @xmath7 is the chromatic number , @xmath8 . in general",
    ", determining the chromatic number of a graph is an arduous problem .",
    "it is known that computing the chromatic number and even more especially , deciding whether a given planar graph is @xmath9-colorable are np - complete problems  @xcite . in other words , it means that no convenient method is known for calculating the chromatic number of an arbitrary graph .",
    "this question now arises naturally : can we at least make a `` good '' approximation on the number of colors we need ? to estimate the chromatic number of a graph , we usually need to go through following steps :    * giving a proper coloring , to find out how many different colors are * sufficient * for coloring . * giving a rigors argument , to show that how many different colors are * necessary * for coloring .",
    "in other words , in the first part we obtain an upper bound and in the second part , we obtain a lower bound on the chromatic number . whatever these bounds are closer , our estimation is better !",
    "to provide new ( topological ) lower bounds on the chromatic number of graphs , hom complexes were defined by lovsz and it has been extensively studied by many authors , see  @xcite .",
    "the breakthrough proof of the well - known kneser conjecture by lovsz  @xcite implies the following lower bound on the chromatic number of graphs .",
    "if @xmath10 is @xmath2-connected , then @xmath11    this result was extended to all complete graphs by babson and kozlov , see  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath12 is @xmath2-connected , then @xmath13 .    to provide a better lower bound on the chromatic number of graphs , lovsz made the following conjecture :    let @xmath14 be the odd cycle with @xmath15 vertices .",
    "if @xmath16 is @xmath2-connected , then @xmath17 .",
    "more generally , bjrner and lovsz made the following conjecture to generalize the concept of a topological obstruction to graph coloring .",
    "if @xmath3 is @xmath2-connected , then @xmath18 .",
    "the first conjecture was confirmed by babson and kozlov  @xcite , but the second one was disproved by hoory and linal  @xcite .",
    "regarding conjecture @xmath6 , the following definition was proposed by kozlov in  @xcite .",
    "a graph @xmath0 is called a ( homotopy ) test graph if for every graph @xmath7 , the @xmath2-connectedness of @xmath3 implies @xmath4 .",
    "so in this terminology , complete graphs and odd cycles are test graphs .",
    "there are many more test graphs known besides these , see  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new topological lower bound for the chromatic number of a special family of graphs . in order to do this ,",
    "we introduce a combinatorial analogue of the borsuk - ulam theorem for @xmath7-spaces .",
    "moreover , as an application of this bound , we give a new proof of the fact that complete graphs and even cycles are test graphs .",
    "one can interpret our approach as a combinatorial method to find test graphs .",
    "we hope that the proposed technique can be effectively used for finding new test graphs .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section @xmath6 , we review some standard facts on simplicial complexes , partially ordered sets , and @xmath7-spaces . in section @xmath9 , we present our main tool : @xmath7-tucker lemma .",
    "finally , in section @xmath19 , our main results are stated and proved .",
    "in this paper , all graphs are finite , simple and undirected . here and subsequently",
    ", @xmath7 stands for a non - trivial finite group , and its identity element is denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "the following is a brief overview of some of the basic concepts we need .",
    "if @xmath21 is a set , then a group action of @xmath7 on @xmath21 is a function @xmath22 denoted @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 and @xmath25 for all @xmath26 and all @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath21 is a topological space and @xmath7 is a topological group , then @xmath21 is called a @xmath7-space if @xmath7 acts continuously on @xmath21 . if , moreover , the action is free , i.e , for all @xmath27 , @xmath28 implies @xmath29 , @xmath21 is called a free @xmath7-space .",

    "the dimension of a simplex @xmath40 is @xmath41 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath34 is the maximum dimension of the simplices in @xmath34 .",
    "we denote the geometric realization of @xmath34 by @xmath42 .",
    "a map @xmath43 is called simplicial if it maps any simplex to a simplex , that is , @xmath44 implies @xmath45 .",
    "every simplicial mapping @xmath46 can be extended linearly to get a continuous mapping @xmath47 , which is called the affine extension of @xmath48 .",
    "a simplicial @xmath7-complex is a simplicial complex together with an action of @xmath7 on its vertices that takes simplices to simplices .",
    "note that if @xmath34 is a simplicial @xmath7-complex then the geometric realization @xmath42 is a @xmath7-space under the natural induced action of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , if the induced action of @xmath7 on @xmath42 is free , then @xmath34 is called a free simplicial @xmath7-complex . for two simplicial @xmath7-complexes @xmath34 and @xmath49 , a simplicial map @xmath50 is called a simplicial @xmath7-equivariant map if @xmath51 for all @xmath33 and all @xmath52 .",
    "one can easily see that , the affine extension of a simplicial @xmath7-equivariant map is a @xmath7-equivariant map .      a partially ordered set or poset is a set and a binary relation @xmath53 such that for all @xmath54 : @xmath55 ( reflexivity ) ; @xmath56 and @xmath57 implies @xmath58 ( transitivity ) ; and @xmath56 and @xmath59 implies @xmath60 ( anti - symmetry ) .",

    "now we are in a position to state the main result of the paper .",
    "let @xmath65 be a finite free @xmath7-poset . if for any comparable elements @xmath120 and @xmath121 in @xmath65 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 are adjacent in @xmath124 , where @xmath125 , then @xmath126    let @xmath127 be a proper coloring of @xmath116 with @xmath128 colors .",
    "this coloring map induces a simplicial @xmath7-equivariant map @xmath129 as follows .",
    "first note that @xmath130 , since for each @xmath131 the vertices in @xmath132 form a clique of size @xmath133 in @xmath116 , therefore @xmath134 . for a given @xmath70 in @xmath65 ,",
    "let @xmath135 be the one among all @xmath136 , @xmath33 with the minimum chromatic number in @xmath116 .",
    "that is , @xmath137 .",
    "note that since every two distinct vertices in @xmath138 are adjacent , the element @xmath135 is uniquely determined .",
    "now , set @xmath139 to show that @xmath140 is a simplicial @xmath7-equivariant map , we need to check :    1 .   for each @xmath33 and @xmath131 , @xmath141 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath142 , then @xmath143 for each nontrivial element @xmath33 ( it shows that @xmath140 is a simplicial map ) .",
    "let @xmath131 and @xmath33 are given . by the definition of @xmath140 ,",
    "there exists a @xmath144 such that @xmath145 .",
    "since @xmath146 and @xmath135 is uniquely determined in @xmath116 , therefore @xmath147 now , let @xmath70 and @xmath148 be comparable elements of @xmath65 .",

    "if @xmath150 for some @xmath33 , then @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "the first equality shows that @xmath153 , since otherwise the vertices @xmath135 and @xmath154 are adjacent in @xmath116 which is contradicts the fact that @xmath155 is a proper coloring of @xmath116 .",
    "thus , @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , we have shown that @xmath140 is a @xmath7-simplicial map .",
    "its map naturally lifts to the @xmath7-equivariant map between @xmath7-spaces @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "thus , according to proposition 1 , @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , @xmath159    now , let us mention two interesting consequences of the theorem .",
    "first , let us recall the definition of the hom complex .",
    "as we pointed out , this concept was defined by lovsz and it has been studied by many authors to provide topological lower bounds on the chromatic number of graphs .",
    "we need the following version of this concept .",
    "let @xmath160 be a graph with vertex set @xmath161 .",
    "for a graph @xmath1 , we define @xmath162 , hom poset , to be the poset whose elements are given by all @xmath84-tuples @xmath163 of non - empty subsets of @xmath164 , such that for any edge @xmath165 of @xmath160 we have @xmath166 .",
    "the partial order is defined by @xmath167 iff @xmath168 for all @xmath169 .",
    "we define the hom complex @xmath170 as the order complex of the resulting poset .",
    "let @xmath171 be the cyclic group of order @xmath172 , and let @xmath173 be the complete graph .",
    "the cyclic group @xmath174 acts on the poset @xmath175 naturally by cyclic shift .",
    "more precisely , for each @xmath176 and @xmath177 , define @xmath178 . clearly this action is free on @xmath175 , and consequently @xmath175 is a free @xmath179-poset .",
    "it is fairly easy to see that this @xmath174-poset @xmath175 satisfies the assumptions of theorem @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , one the one hand we have @xmath180 on the other hand , we have an obvious graph homomorphism from @xmath181 to @xmath1 by sending each vertex @xmath182 to an arbitrary element of @xmath183 .",
    "this give us the following lower bound on chromatic number @xmath184 the following corollary is an immediate consequence of the definition of the test graphs , proposition @xmath185 , and the above argument .",
    "all complete graphs are test graphs .    as another application of our main result",
    ", we also reprove that all cycles of even length are test graphs .",
    "let @xmath186 be a cycle of even length with vertex set @xmath187 .",
    "the group @xmath188 acts on @xmath189 as follows , @xmath190 .",
    "clearly , @xmath189 with this action is a free @xmath191-poset .",
    "one can check that @xmath189 satisfies the assumptions of theorem @xmath9 , therefore we have @xmath192 indeed , we have a graph homomorphism from @xmath193 to @xmath1 by sending each vertex @xmath194 to an arbitrary element of @xmath183 .",
    "thus , @xmath195 in conclusion , we have the following corollary .",
    "all cycle graphs of even length are test graphs .",
