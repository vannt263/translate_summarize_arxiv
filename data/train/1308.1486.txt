    "it is , however , not exclusively due to the functional  indeed , the rsmchf ( no src ) pec deviates slightly from the exact pec .",

    ", the accurate value of this energy for @xmath132 is 0.010.015@xmath142 .",
    "this difference suggests that the srlda exchange  correlation density - functional potential , from which the mc - srlda wavefunction ( and hence the rsmchf energy ) is obtained , may not be accurate enough , especially as the wavefunction is strongly multi - configurational in this region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ occnumberswithdist ] .",
    "interestingly , errors on the short - range potential and the short - range md correlation density functional seem to compensate in the rsmchf energy when @xmath154  but not for the other bond distances .",

    "optimization of the sroep at the long - range mcscf level should , on the other hand , give essentially the exact solution.@xcite it is noteworthy that , in a minimal atomic - orbital basis , the exact energy would actually be obtained at both rsmchf ( no src ) and mc - srfep ( no src ) levels of theory since the wavefunction is then fixed to @xmath156 , where the bonding @xmath157 and the anti - bonding @xmath158 molecular orbitals are simply linear combinations of the atomic @xmath159 orbitals of each hydrogen atom.@xcite in our calculations , as larger basis are used , orbitals can rotate so that different energies can be obtained .",

    "<S> acc .  * 114 * , 305 ( 2005 ) ] is explored in the context of multi - configuration range - separated density - functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> the new decomposition of the short - range exchange  correlation energy relies on the auxiliary long - range interacting wavefunction rather than the kohn </S>",

    "<S> the advantage , relative to the traditional ks decomposition , is that the wavefunction part of the energy is now computed with the regular ( fully - interacting ) hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> one potential drawback is that , because of double counting , the wavefunction used to compute the energy can not be obtained by minimizing the energy expression with respect to the wavefunction parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is overcome by using short - range optimized effective potentials ( oeps ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting combination of oep techniques with wavefunction theory has been investigated in this work , at the _ hartree - fock _ ( hf ) and _ multi - configuration self - consistent - field _ ( mcscf ) levels . in the hf case , </S>",
    "<S> an analytical expression for the energy gradient has been derived and implemented . </S>",
    "<S> calculations have been performed within the short - range local density approximation on h@xmath0 , n@xmath0 , li@xmath0 and h@xmath0o . </S>",
    "<S> significant improvements in binding energies are obtained with the new decomposition of the short - range energy . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of optimizing the short - range oep at the mcscf level when static correlation becomes significant has also been demonstrated for h@xmath0 , using a finite - difference gradient . </S>",
