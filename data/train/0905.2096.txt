    "in 1978 fisher and de gennes @xcite realized that there should be a so called `` thermodynamic '' casimir effect .",

    "in the neighbourhood of the critical point , various quantities diverge following power laws . e.g.",
    "the correlation length , which measures the spatial extension of fluctuations , behaves as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the reduced temperature and @xmath9 the critical temperature . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the amplitude of the correlation length in the high and low temperature phase , respectively . while @xmath10 and @xmath11 depend on the microscopic details of the system , the critical exponent @xmath12 and the ratio @xmath13 are universal .",

    "this behaviour is described by the theory of finite size scaling ( fss ) .",
    "for reviews see @xcite . in general the physics in the neighbourhood of the transition is governed by the ratio @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the linear extension of the container and @xmath16 the correlation length of the bulk system .",
