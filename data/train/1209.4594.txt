    "observations of our own galactic center ( gc ) reveal that stars there move on keplerian orbits in the potential of a central compact object , which is consistent with a massive black hole ( mbh ) of mass @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it is widely assumed that the milky way is not unique in this sense , and that there is an mbh in the center of most , if not all , galaxies .",
    "the gc , with its relatively low - mass mbh , represents a sub - class of galactic nuclei where the dynamical relaxation time is expected to be shorter than the hubble time @xcite , so that the stellar distribution near the mbh could have had time to reach a relaxed state that is independent of initial conditions .",
    "moreover , because of its proximity , it is the only system to date where the dynamical state can be directly probed by observations .",
    "however , recent star counts in the gc @xcite indicate that the radial density profile of the spectroscopically identified low - mass red giants on the @xmath13 pc scale , thought to trace the long - lived population there , rises inward much less steeply ( or even decreases ) than is expected for a dynamically relaxed stellar population @xcite .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that , contrary to expectations , the gc is not dynamically relaxed by two - body interactions .",
    "this could be due , for example , to a cosmologically recent major merger event with another mbh , which carved out a central cavity in the stellar distribution @xcite , or due to the presence of faster competing dynamical processes that drain stars into the mbh @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is however further complicated by a recent study of the diffuse light density distribution in the gc @xcite , which is thought to track the low - mass , long - lived main - sequence stars that are too faint and numerous to be individually resolved , and consist of the bulk of the stellar mass . in contrast with the stellar number counts , the diffuse light distribution appears to rise inward rather steeply down to the @xmath14 pc scale , where destructive stellar collisions ( not accounted for in the purely gravitational treatment of two - body relaxation ) , can plausibly suppress the stellar density profile @xcite .",
    "these uncertainties about the dynamical state of the gc , and by implication , the state of galactic nuclei in general , have far - reaching ramifications .",
    "the possibility that the gc is unrelaxed severely limits the validity of extrapolating results derived from the unique observations of the gc to other galactic nuclei .",
    "while a relaxed system can be understood and modeled from first principles , independently of initial conditions , an unrelaxed one reflects its particular formation history , which is expected to vary substantially from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "this , and the possibility that the gc lacks the predicted high - density central stellar cusp , have in particular crucial implications for attempts to understand the dynamics of extra - galactic gravitational wave ( gw ) sources and to predict their rates , since the low - mass mbh in the gc has long been considered the archetype of low - frequency extra - galactic targets for planned space - borne gw observatories @xcite .",
    "the study of dynamical relaxation around a mbh has a long history , beginning with the seminal studies of @xcite , who used various simplifying approximations @xcite to enable analytical and numerical approaches , and continuing more recently with studies of the time to approach steady state near a mbh in large @xmath0-body simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". a complementary approach of extracting the diffusion coefficients ( dcs ) from stellar energy evolution in @xmath0-body simulations was carried out in several studies @xcite , leading to widely differing predictions about the dynamical state of galactic nuclei , especially very close to the mbh @xcite .",
    "these open questions , and the fundamental importance of the process of orbital energy relaxation , motivate a re - examination of the analytic description of energy relaxation , coupled to detailed comparisons with carefully controlled simulations .      in this study",
    "we use analytical considerations and high - accuracy @xmath0-body simulations to address the following open questions : what is the relation between local energy relaxation and the approach to a global steady state ?",
    "what are the properties of evolution due to energy relaxation on the short and intermediate timescales ?",
    "how rare are extreme energy exchange events , and what is their contribution to relaxation ? what is the physical meaning , and the correct value , of the coulomb cutoffs introduced to control the formal divergences in the relaxation rates ? in practical terms , these questions all reduce to the problem of relating the analytical / statistical description of local two - body interactions , to the global measurable properties of a stellar system .",
    "these issues must be addressed in order to better understand dynamical processes in galactic nuclei , improve their modeling , and reliably apply results from @xmath0-body simulations to real physical systems .",
    "our approach to these problems is complementary to that of @xcite .",
    "@xcite simulated a very large system with a non - keplerian , and non - self - similar initial df and potential and a relatively low mass ratio @xmath5 over a relaxation timescale .",
    "@xcite show that there is an agreement between the @xmath0-body and fokker - planck ( fp ) simulations by comparing the evolution of a small inner sub - system where the potential is dominated by that of the mbh and where the analytical/ numerical solution of @xcite ( henceforth the bw cusp ) is relevant .    here",
    ", we carry out a suite of small @xmath0-body simulations of a system with realistically high values of @xmath15 and a potential that is dominated by the mbh , designed specifically to simplify the analytic treatment and to allow complete modeling of the time - dependent evolution on short timescales .",
    "this allows us to rigorously test and verify the theoretical predictions , and in particular the scaling of the relaxation with energy and with the slope of the cusp .",
    "the choice of focusing on short timescales is to a large extent forced by the high computational cost of the simulations , since we model a high mass ratio system ( @xmath16 , comparable to the mass ratio in the gc ) with @xmath17 particles which are strongly bound to the mbh .",
    "the short timescale behavior is however also of interest in itself , since dynamical processes near a mbh can be limited by the lifetime of the stars ( for example , the massive stars in the gc ) , or by fast destructive processes ( for example , collisional destruction or tidal disruption ) .",
    "the elementary description of energy relaxation is by the energy _",
    "transition probability _ , @xmath18 ( eq .  [ eq : k - je ] ) , which is the orbit - averaged probability per unit time , per unit energy , for the energy of a star to change from @xmath19 to @xmath20 in a single scattering event .",
    "the resulting distribution of the accumulated change in energy over a finite time @xmath21 , @xmath22 , is represented by the _",
    "propagator _ , @xmath23 , which describes the energy distribution of an initially mono - energetic system of test stars , after a time @xmath21 .",
    "past standard treatments of energy relaxation in stellar systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the fp formalism implicitly assumed that only the two lowest moments of the energy transition probability ( i.e. the 1st and 2nd dcs ) play part in the evolution of the system .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the free propagator is a gaussian with width proportional to @xmath24 , that is , energy evolves by normal diffusion .",
    "however , as we show , the @xmath25 divergence of the transition probability @xcite implies that higher order dcs do play a role , which is dominant on short timescales , and diminishes with time , but still remains non - negligible even when the system relaxes to steady state .",
    "the implications are that energy relaxation progresses somewhat faster than @xmath24 , as an anomalous diffusion process .",
    "our approach of measuring energy relaxation in @xmath0-body simulations on short timescales forces us to develop a robust statistical model for describing these timescales . by treating the problem in fourier space , we are able to derive the full propagator explicitly .",
    "it can then be evaluated either numerically in non - perturbative form , or analytically in a perturbative manner .",
    "this enables us to show that the propagator is a heavy - tailed df that evolves as @xmath26 on timescales much shorter than the fp energy diffusion timescale .",
    "this short timescale behavior is an example of an anomalous diffusion process @xcite .",
    "one consequence is the much higher probability of events that would be expected to be extremely rare for a gaussian probability distribution .",
    "another implication of the very slow convergence of this propagator to the central limit is that attempts to measure relaxation in relatively short @xmath0-body experiments can yield very misleading results , which reflect more the method used , than the quantity probed . by analyzing the scaling properties of the energy propagator we suggest a robust statistical estimator , using fractional moments , which is independent of the high energy cutoff . with it",
    "we measure the rate of energy relaxation on short timescales and confirm our analytical treatment , and in particular , the validity of the propagator and the dcs used in the standard fp approximation .",
    "finally , we use the propagator to evolve a system by mc simulations up to steady state , and thereby confirm the approximate validity of the fp results on long timescales .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ s : e - relax ] we summarize the process of energy relaxation around a massive object in terms of a normal diffusion process described by the fp equation , and derive an analytical solution for the evolution of a stellar cusp to steady state . in section  [ s : beyondfp ] we present an elementary description of energy relaxation in terms of the transition probability and its integrated propagator , and describe the emergence of anomalous diffusion that ultimately approaches normal diffusion on long timescales . in section  [",
    "s : measurements ] we formulate a method to analyze our @xmath0-body simulations and use it to confirm and calibrate our analytical description of relaxation . in section  [ s : gcorbit ] we briefly discuss the observable effects of anomalous diffusion on short period stars orbiting the galactic mbh , perturbed by a dark cusp of stellar remnants .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in section  [ s : summary ] .",
    "the standard approach @xcite of treating relaxation in a self - gravitating system involves several simplifying assumptions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the 2-body perturbations experienced by a test star are assumed to be independent of each other , that is , non - coherent .",
    "the encounter is assumed to be between two unbound stars , approaching each other from infinity .",
    "the perturbations are assumed to be local in two respects .",
    "( 1 ) the exchange of energy and angular momentum occurs over a very short time at the point of closest approach .",
    "( 2 ) the local conditions ( stellar density and velocity ) at the position of the test star , at the time of interaction , apply to all perturbers irrespective of their impact parameter , which is equivalent to assuming an infinite homogeneous system around the point of interaction .",
    "these assumptions can not be satisfied for arbitrarily large impact parameters , and therefore require the introduction of a large - distance cutoff , which enters in the coulomb factor @xmath27 .",
    "note however that it is far from obvious that these assumptions hold near a mbh .",
    "the potential there is dominated by the central mass , and on intermediate scales ( close to the mbh , but far enough to ignore relativistic effects ) is approximately keplerian , @xmath28 ; the stellar density decreases steeply with radius ; and there is strong energy - dependent stratification of dynamical timescales .",
    "we discuss here the implications of these factors on energy relaxation near a mbh .",
    "finally , it is commonly assumed that this markovian process is also a diffusive processes , and can therefore described by the fp equation .",
    "determining the stellar distribution in the vicinity of an mbh is a classical problem in stellar dynamics , first discussed in the context of an mbh embedded in a globular cluster @xcite .",
    "the general time evolution of the phase - space distribution function ( df ) of test particles with mass @xmath29 , @xmath30 , due to two - body interaction with field stars in a local velocity - mass distribution @xmath31 , is given by the master equation @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the transition probability per unit time per unit velocity volume that a test star changed its velocity from @xmath35 to @xmath36 as a result of a single encounter with a field star @xmath37    this description of stellar dynamics as a relaxation process assumes that changes in energy and angular momentum result from uncorrelated velocity deflections , which are local in time and space ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dynamical mechanisms that involve long timescale correlations , e.g. resonant relaxation @xcite , are not taken into account here .",

    "the master equation is then reduced to an equation of energy only ( here and below the energy and potential of bound stars is defined as positive ) , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the orbit- and eccentricity - averaged energy transition probability , and @xmath43 is the stellar number density in energy space    @xmath44    by assuming weak encounters , @xmath45 , and expanding @xmath46 and @xmath47 around @xmath48 , the master equation can be expressed as a kramers - moyal expansion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

[ eq : gamma1-cusp - inf ] , [ eq : gamma2-cusp - inf ] ) ; for higher moments the dependence is much weaker , @xmath56 ( eq . [ eq : dcsh ] ) , and can usually be ignored .    by truncating the sum after the first two terms",
    ", the kramers - moyal expansion is reduced to the fp equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the stellar flux .",
    "the fp approximation is valid only if the higher order terms can be neglected .",
    "this is usually justified by arguing that the @xmath59 terms of the expansion are of the order of the @xmath59 dcs themselves , which are smaller than the first two dcs by a factor of @xmath60 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , as we show in section  [ sub : st - propagation ] , such a comparison is meaningful only when @xmath61 ( eq . [ eq : dcsh ] ) , i.e. the change in energy has accumulated to an order unity change .",
    "this is a valid assumption only over long timescales ; on short timescales the system can not be described by the first two dcs only .",
    "it is further commonly assumed that stars that are unbound to the mbh ( @xmath62 ) are drawn from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the stellar number density and velocity dispersion of this simplified model of the host galaxy .",
    "the inner energy boundary is determined by the maximal orbital energy @xmath66 where stars can survive against any of the various disruption mechanisms that operate in the extreme environment near a mbh ( e.g. tidal disruption , tidal heating , orbital decay by gravitational wave emission , stellar collisions ) , @xmath67    the steady state solution ( @xmath68 ) of the fp equation can be simply obtained if a cusp solution @xmath69 is assumed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although this solution does not satisfy the boundary conditions ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : boundary - out ] , [ eq : boundary - in ] ) , it is in fact a reasonable approximation of the full solution far from the boundaries at @xmath70 , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for a full analytic solution see @xcite .",

    "the bw cusp solution has zero net flow ( @xmath79 ) since the term in the equation that contains the second dc is independent of energy , and since there is no drift @xcite .",
    "this solution was confirmed by integrating the fp equation , both numerically ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and statistically ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , by monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations .      stellar systems out of equilibrium evolve by redistributing their energy and angular momentum .",
    "when this proceeds by diffusion , the timescales associated with the various dcs generally reflect the dynamical evolution timescale .",
    "one such timescale is the energy diffusion time @xmath1 , @xmath80 which expresses the timescale for a test star to change its orbital energy by order unity .",
    "another commonly used quantity is the chandrasekhar relaxation time @xcite , @xmath81 where the second equality expresses the timescale for a typical test star with velocity @xmath82 , to change its kinetic energy by order unity , in a maxwellian , isotropic and homogeneous stellar system with stellar mass @xmath83 , number density @xmath84 and velocity dispersion @xmath85 .",
    "the coulomb logarithm is defined by the ratio of maximal and minimal impact parameters @xmath86 , where @xmath87 ( small angle approximation ) , and @xmath88 is the size of the system .",
    "these two timescales are related , but different , since @xmath89 is local when an infinite homogeneous system is assumed . ] in physical space ( @xmath90 ) , whereas @xmath1 is local in @xmath91 space , and hence is orbit - averaged over all ( @xmath90 ) values along the orbit , and often samples a wide range of conditions in the stellar cluster .",
    "it is therefore to be expected that the values of the two timescales can be quite different , even though they express the same basic property of the system : systems with short relaxation timescales evolve rapidly , and those with long timescales evolve slowly .",
    "for example , when the two timescale are compared at @xmath92 , typically @xmath93 ( eq . [ eq : t - e - cusp ] ) .",
    "the diffusive timescales can not be used in themselves to estimate how long it takes an out - of - equilibrium system to approach steady state , assuming that such exists .",
    "this generally depends on the specific initial conditions , and the operative definition of convergence to steady state .",
    "numeric experiments show that in many cases @xmath94 , evaluated at the radius of mbh influence , is a reasonable estimator for the relaxation time to steady state , @xmath2 .",
    "we now proceed to use the fp equation to demonstrate analytically why that is so , and to derive the relation between @xmath1 , @xmath94 and @xmath2 in a power - law stellar cusp around a mbh . in section [ ss : longtimes ]",
    "we verify that our analysis is not limited by the approximate nature of the fp treatment , by numerically integrating the system using mc simulations where the individual energy steps are generated using the isotropic propagator @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , we show that strong encounters , which are ignored in the fp treatment , reduce the time to reach steady state by a factor of only @xmath96 .",
    "consider a background stellar population in steady state with a power - law cusp @xmath97 , where @xmath0 is the total number of stars with @xmath98 .",
    "the dcs ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : gamma1-cusp - inf ] ,  [ eq : gamma2-cusp - inf ] ) are @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    "this system describes , for example , test stars that are scattered by a steady state distribution of field stars . over time",
    ", the perturbation will spread out until it relaxes to the @xmath103 steady state distribution .",
    "the dimensionless fp equation for the evolution of @xmath104 is @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "we assume that the number of stars with @xmath98 is constant ( i.e.   there is a reflective boundary at @xmath108 ) .",
    "the perturbation then evolves as ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : n(x , t)-impulse - respond ] ) @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 is the bessel function of the first kind and @xmath113 is the @xmath83th zero of @xmath112 .",
    "similar solutions for a power - law background cusps with @xmath114 are presented in appendix [ s : fp - solution ] .",
    "the time it takes for the small perturbation to decay , and for the system to converge back to its steady state , depends on the location of the initial perturbation , and on the operative definition of the convergence .",
    "the dynamical evolution back to steady state is slower for higher @xmath115 ( closer to the mbh ) , in spite of the fact that the relaxation time decreases in that limit as @xmath116 ( @xmath117 .",
    "this counter - intuitive result can be understood by considering a perturbation of mass @xmath118 at @xmath119 , where the enclosed steady state mass scales as @xmath120 .",
    "it then follows the fractional perturbation scales as @xmath121 , and the rate for relaxing the perturbation scales as @xmath122 .",
    "we therefore conservatively define the relaxation time as the time it takes a @xmath123-function perturbation in the limit @xmath124 to decay to an order unity perturbation , @xmath125 , where @xmath126 where here @xmath127 is the gamma function .",
    "this corresponds to the relaxation time @xmath128    the conclusion that @xmath129 is robust , since it mostly reflects the time it takes the perturbation to propagate down to @xmath130 , rather than the exact details of the convergence criterion .",
    "for example , an alternative definition of @xmath2 in terms of evaporation , leads to a similar result . consider the evaporation of a perturbation through the outer boundary @xmath130 , and define the relaxation time to steady state as the time it takes the number of stars still in the system to decrease by a factor @xmath131 ( the conclusions depend only logarithmically on the exact value of @xmath132 ) . in this setting the probability to find the test star in the system",
    "is given by ( see eq .  [ eq : n - p(x , t ) ] )    @xmath133    and the relaxation time ( in the limit @xmath134 is given by @xmath135 similar to the relaxation time we obtained before .",
    "this simple model can also explain the behavior seen in a variety of dynamical simulations of relaxation around a mbh ( @xcite figure 2 ; @xcite figure 1 ; @xcite figure 30 ) : the initial relaxation to steady state is extremely rapid ( super - exponential ) , while at later times it slows down to exponential decay .",
    "( [ eq : eta ] ) indeed shows that the perturbation converges to steady state as a series of exponential decaying terms with progressively faster rates @xmath136 .",
    "thus , the higher terms vanish rapidly in a combined super - exponential rate , leaving last only the first and slowest term , which decays exponentially on a timescale @xmath137 .",
    "the relaxation time to steady state , @xmath2 , can be related to the chandrasekhar time @xmath89 in the host galaxy ( idealized here as an isotropic and homogeneous system ) . beyond the mbh radius of influence at @xmath138 , where @xmath65 is the asymptotic velocity dispersion and the stars are unbound to the mbh ( @xmath62 ) .",

    "table [ t : propagators ] summarizes the properties of the four isotropic propagators that enter our analysis of relaxation .",
    "the inclusion of strong encounters in the transition probability can only accelerate relaxation .",
    "therefore , the sp is expected to lead to the fastest relaxation , followed by the ep , while the wp and the fp are slowest , since they assume the weak limit .",
    "the question of the existence and values of the moments of the propagators reflect the form assumed for the transition probability , and in turn are related to the nature of the long - term evolution of the system .",
    "the weak limit assumption introduces a cutoff on the energy exchange , which ensures that all moments exist .",

    "this lower limit is to be compared to the time for relaxation that can be formally defined for the ep through its @xmath288 diffusion coefficient , where for the @xmath78 cusp , @xmath289 ( see eq .",

    "however , it is not at all guaranteed that this convenient and useful limit provides a valid description of the accumulated effects of the transition probability  this has to be proved case by case .",
    "there are in fact many examples of anomalous diffusive processes , whose origins can be traced to divergences of the moments of the transition probability , such as the super - diffusive levy flights ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )    the fp equation has been applied extensively in past studies of nuclear dynamics near a mbh . however , the simplifications , assumptions and free parameters ( many necessitated by the diverging , un - screened nature of the gravitational force ) , which are needed to justify and use this method , remained largely untested .",
    "this called for a more rigorous validation of the basic underlying assumptions .",
    "this need was further motivated by some conflicting theoretical and numerical results on the emerging timescales of diffusion and relaxation in galactic nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these impact multiple issues of interest : the rates of tidal disruptions , the rates of gw emission events from inspiralling compact objects , and the stellar distributions very close to mbhs , and in particular those of compact remnants and stars on relativistic orbits .",
    "furthermore , the one system where the stellar distribution around an mbh can be directly observed , the gc , does not follow the fp predictions for an isolated old population , in contrast to prior expectations @xcite .",
    "past studies of relaxation theory usually bypassed the use of the transition probability ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "they assumed from the outset that the diffusion coefficients exist and only the first two are important , and calculated them by adopting cutoffs ( the small angle and hyperbolic orbits approximations ) for the exchanged energy in 2-body interactions .",
    "however , this procedure limits the possibility of describing the behavior on short - timescales , of verifying that relaxation does in fact converge to normal diffusion , and of estimating the contribution of strong encounters .",
    "we focused here on the short - timescale behavior of energy relaxation , which can be directly probed by high - accuracy @xmath0-body simulations , and is easier to describe analytically in terms of small deviations from an almost stationary df .",
    "we derived a rigorous analytical description of relaxation on short - timescales , which we validated by fitting to numerical results using a robust statistical analysis method .",

    "it should be emphasized that the convergence of the propagator to the central limit , and the return of the stellar system to steady state , are in principle unrelated processes , which proceed at unrelated rates .",
    "there is therefore no a - priori guarantee that the fp treatment is a good approximation for describing relaxation .",
    "however , we showed that in the weak limit , the evolution of the propagator converges to the fp description long before the system relaxes to its steady state .",
    "we also showed that the inclusion of strong collisions shortens the convergence time by less than a factor of @xmath419 , because the system reaches steady state before these rare collisions have time to play a substantial role .",
    "together these results validate the use of the fp approximation on the intermediate and long timescales , and prove that a perturbed bw cusp will regain is steady state after @xmath274 , where @xmath1 is the diffusion time at the outer boundary .",
    "we conclude that stellar cusps around lower - mass mbhs ( @xmath11 ) , which have evolved passively over a hubble time , should be dynamically relaxed .",
    "anomalous diffusion can affect processes observed on short timescales . as an example , we showed that if future observation of stars orbiting the galactic mbh detect orbital energy perturbations due to the dark cusp of stellar remnants that is expected to be there , estimates of the cusp density will depend critically on accounting for the anomalous nature of the diffusion .",
