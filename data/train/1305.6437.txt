    "the detailed and systematic investigations on the grs would give us a unique information on the shape phase transition in nuclei .",
    "in contrast to low - energy modes of excitation in nuclei , the grs substantially reflect bulk nuclear properties .",
    "thus , their studies may provide information on the nuclear matter .",
    "the grs can be qualitatively investigated by using various macroscopic models , such as fluiddynamical models which properly take account of deformation of the fermi sphere  @xcite . however",
