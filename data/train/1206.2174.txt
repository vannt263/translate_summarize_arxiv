    "the interaction between a quantum system and its environments leads to loss of quantum coherence , or decoherence , in the system .",
    "understanding decoherence is crucial for grasping the boundary between quantum and classical physics .",
    "@xcite it is also essential for testing theories describing quantum measurements .",
    "@xcite    from an engineering point of view , the decay of coherence in quantum bit devices ( qubits ) is the most important obstacle for constructing a working quantum computer .",
    "solid state qubits are leading candidates in the projects of designing quantum circuits , where the coherence times of the qubits are required to be sufficiently long to allow for manipulations and transfer of information by logical gates .",
    "the most important source of decoherence in many realizations of solid state qubits are believed to be bistable fluctuators  two level systems ( tlss ) , present as tunneling states in the amorphous substrate  @xcite used to fabricate the qubit , or in the tunneling junction in superconductor - based devices .",
    "@xcite    these tlss are quantum mechanical systems that are , in turn , coupled to their own environments , which are conventionally considered as uncorrelated thermal baths",
    ". usually one does not worry about the fine details of the environment of the tlss , but rather uses simplified models .",
    "the most popular is the bloch - redfield approach ,  @xcite where the environment is taken into account by introduction of the relaxation and decoherence rates of the tlss .",
    "if the tlss couple more strongly to their own environment than to the qubit , they are usually treated classically .",
    "this means that the dynamical description of the tlss is replaced by a classical dynamics of a fluctuator , which switches randomly between its two metastable states according to a random telegraph process ( rtp ) .",
    "@xcite this approach is often referred to as the spin - fluctuator model .",
    "@xcite in many cases , however , the decoherence of the qubit is determined by only a few fluctuators that are more strongly coupled to the qubit than others .",
    "@xcite in such cases , one might question the validity of the classical model . from a practical point of view",
    ", it is therefore important to know when such a simplified classical description can replace the full quantum mechanical one .",
    "it is also of more fundamental interest in view of the decoherence approach to the quantum - classical transition .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we will develop a simple model allowing to show when a quantum system can in practice be replaced by a classical one , in the sense that interference effects can no longer be observed due to the entanglement with the environment .",
    "however , we believe that this is only a question of a system becoming _ in practice _ classical , i.e. , when we can use a classical model to calculate a physical property of a quantum system . it does not shed any light on the real limitation of quantum mechanics such as the measurement problem , where one discuss deviations from linear quantum mechanics , see ref .   for a discussion .",
    "previously , the boundary between quantum and classical regime for the tls has been explored in a model where the qubit is coupled to an impurity state , and an electron can tunnel between this state and an electron reservoir ( metal ) .",
    "@xcite the qubit dephasing rate calculated in the quantum model was found to converge to the classical result in the high - temperature limit . in the study by abel and marquardt ,",
    "@xcite a threshold for strong coupling between the qubit and the tls was defined by the onset of visibility oscillations in the qubit as a function of the ratio between the coupling to the qubit and the reservoir . the threshold for visibility oscillations",
    "was found for higher values of the qubit coupling in the quantum model compared to the classical model , the thresholds finally converge at high @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the tls - reservoir coupling . thus , both in the decoherence rate and in the visibility oscillations",
    "the classical limit is recovered at high temperature . in this model ,",
    "the temperature plays a dual role : it affects both the energy relaxation rate of the tls , which maps to the switching rate of the rtp , and it affects the dephasing rate of the tls .",
    "the usefulness of separation of the two effects is seen by the fact that it is perfectly possible to consider finite - temperature classical fluctuators by using an asymetric rtp.@xcite this is never obtained in any limit of the model discussed in refs .  .",
    "the subsequent considerations are based on the following qualitative picture : the dephasing of the qubit is caused by the generation of entanglement between the qubit and the environment .",
    "if the qubit and the tls are strongly coupled , then they behave as a combined four - level quantum system and the quantum nature of the tls will be important . in such a situation one can not replace it by a classical rtp . on the other hand , if the tls is sufficiently strongly coupled to the environment , it means that the information about its state is continuously transferred to the environment and this prevents any quantum interference to take place . from this",
    "we can guess that the relevant quantity determining whether the tls can be considered either classical or quantum is the ratio of the qubit - tls coupling ( which determines the rate of entanglement generation between the qubit and tls ) and the tls dephasing rate .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the applicability of the classical model for qubit decoherence due to a tls . in order to achieve this",
    "we study a model where the dephasing rate of the tls can be varied independently of the temperature , so that the classical limit can be taken at any temperature and correspond to the proper assymetric rtp .",
    "we investigate the regime where the tls is coupled weakly to the qubit . by use of a model borrowed from the study of tlss in glasses ,",
    "we compare the pure decoherence rate of the qubit subject to either a quantum tls , in turn coupled to its environment , or a classical fluctuatur , modeled by random telegraph noise .",
    "our model allows us to separate the effects of temperature , coupling to the bath , and decoherence rate of the tls .",
    "we find that the difference in the qubit decoherence rate predicted by the quantum model and the classical one depends on the ratio , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the qubit - tls coupling strength and @xmath4 is the decoherence rate of the tls in the pointer basis .",
    "we start by describing the quantum mechanical model for the tls .",
    "the model we use for the tls originates in the study of tunneling states in glasses , i.e. , a particle , or a group of particles that can be approximated by a single configuratiol coordinate in a double - well potential .",
    "@xcite if the particle is charged , it may give rise to a potential on the qubit that depends on its position in the double - well .    following phillips ,  @xcite the hamiltonian for the coupled qubit - tls",
    "is split into the hamiltonians @xmath5 for the qubit , @xmath6 for the tls , @xmath7 for the qubit - tls interaction , @xmath8 for the environment and @xmath9 for the tls - environment interaction : @xmath10 where the pauli matrices @xmath11 , @xmath12 are operators in the hilbert spaces of the qubit and the tls , respectively .",
    "the energy splitting , @xmath13 , and the tunnel amplitude , @xmath14 , can be calculated from the shape of the double - well potential .",
    "@xcite the energy of the qubit depends on the position of the particle in the double - well ( we will in the following refer to the eigenstates of @xmath15 as the position basis ) , and the coupling strength is given by @xmath3 . in this work",
    ", we will assume the simplified case where the qubit does not directly interact with the environment and therefore has no intrinsic dynamics in the absence of the tls .",
    "furthermore , we consider a model where the qubit is subject to pure dephasing @xmath16=0 $ ] , there is no energy relaxation of the qubit in this model and the decoherence of the qubit is therefore insensitive to the qubit energy splitting @xmath17 . when energy relaxation is present , coherent beatings between the qubit and resonant fluctuators are observed .",
    "@xcite in this strong coupling regime , the fluctuator has to be treated as a quantum system .",
    "our present work concentrates solely on non - resonant fluctuators , which are typically modeled classically .",
    "the double - well potential is in general perturbed by electromagnetic and strain fields modifying the asymmetry energy @xmath13 , while perturbations of the barrier height can usually be ignored .",
    "@xcite in our model we therefore assume that the environment couples to the tls in the position basis , i.e. , the eigenbasis of @xmath15 . rather than formally specifying @xmath8 and @xmath9 we consider two kinds of interaction between the tls and the external environment , resonant and non - resonant .",
    "resonant interaction , e.g. , phonons with frequency close to the eigenfrequency of the tls , are responsible for direct transitions between the eigenstates of the tls , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we model this interaction by use of the generalized measurement operators defined for a small time step @xmath20 as@xcite    @xmath21    here @xmath22 is the identity matrix in the hilbert space of the qubit and the matrices @xmath23 ` measures ' whether the tls is in the ground ( excited ) state , projects the tls onto this state and flips it .",

    ". the non - resonant interaction does not cause transitions between the eigenstates of the tls .",
    "however , we might assume that in general the state of a phonon interacting with the tls is perturbed by the interaction , and that the perturbation depends on the position of the system in the double - well .",
    "schematically we can write @xmath28 where @xmath29 index the state of the tls in the position basis , @xmath30 is the initial state of the phonon and @xmath31 is the state of the phonon after the interaction , conditioned upon that the tls was initially in the state indexed by @xmath32 .",
    "the interaction , eq .",
    ", results in entanglement between the phonon and the tls , reducing the coherence of the latter .",
    "the rate of decoherence due to non - resonant phonons depends on the overlap element @xmath33 and on the rate of phonons interacting with the system .",
    "we model this interaction by the single parameter @xmath34 , which is responsible for the decay rate of the off - diagonal density matrix elements of the tls in the position basis .    , while the resonant phonons are responsible for relaxation parallell to the z-axis , which is the eigenbasis of the tls .",
    "we define the pointer basis by the basis in which the equilibrium density matrix @xmath35 is diagonal .",

    "experimentally , since the composite density matrix @xmath109 is required , the mutual information can only be extracted in the case where one has access to measurement on both the qubit and the fluctuator simultaneously . since",

    "therefore , one should be careful in applying the classical telegraph model unless one expects the decoherence rates of the fluctuators to be much larger than the qubit - fluctuator coupling .",
