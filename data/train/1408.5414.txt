    "it is well established that a significant fraction of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are intrinsically obscured by gas and dust surrounding the central supermassive black holes ( smbh ) .",
    "obscured agn are needed to explain the @xmath230  kev peak of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ; e.g.,@xcite ) , however , their space density is observationally poorly constrained .",
    "agn obscured by gas with column density of @xmath3  @xmath1 have been identified in large numbers in deep soft x - ray ( @xmath4  kev ) surveys @xcite , which are powerful means for identifying the bulk of the agn population at high redshift and thus providing valuable constraints on the growth history of smbh ( e.g.@xcite ) . however ,",
    "the heavily obscured , compton - thick sources ( @xmath5  @xmath1 ; see , e.g.@xcite for a review ) required by the cxb models remain elusive .",
    "recent surveys with the hard x - ray ( @xmath6  kev ) telescopes ( _ burst alert telescope _ ; @xcite ) and ( _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ ; @xcite ) indicate that in the local universe the fraction of obscured agn ( with @xmath7  @xmath1 ) is approximately 80% , while compton - thick sources likely contribute about 20% of the total number of agn ( estimated from the observed @xmath810% fraction corrected for survey completeness , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "obscured agn therefore contribute significantly to the local supermassive black hole space density @xcite and may be even more important at earlier epochs @xcite .",
    "the peak of the cxb at @xmath230  kev can be reproduced by invoking a significant number of compton - thick sources at moderate redshift ( e.g.,@xcite ) , however , to date only a few percent of the cxb has actually been resolved at its peak energy ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of the obscuring column density and the degeneracy in relative contributions of absorption- and reflection - dominated hard x - ray spectra are therefore poorly constrained with the current data .    a primary goal of the ( _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array _ )",
    "hard x - ray mission is to study the evolution of obscuration in agn at @xmath9 through its comprehensive extragalactic survey program @xcite .",
    "in addition to blank - field observations ( mullaney , _ in prep . _ ; civano , _ in prep . _ ) , the program includes a survey of known sources selected from the catalog with two goals : ( i ) obtain high - quality spectroscopy of the nearby @xmath10-selected agn , and ( ii ) perform a wide - field search for serendipitous background sources @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present observations and modeling of the hard x - ray spectra of three local agn : ngc  424 , ngc  1320 , and ic  2560 , two of which are selected from the program outlined above .",
    "all three show spectra dominated by reflection from cold , distant , compton - thick material , the properties of which are impossible to fully constrain using only soft x - ray data .",
    "these compton - thick agn demonstrate how spectroscopy of the nearby targets can characterize their x - ray properties better than previously possible , and how the new constraints may lead to improved understanding of both local agn and their distant counterparts .",
    "ultimately , the surveys will allow us to directly determine the fraction of compton - thick sources in the agn population and the distribution of the obscuring column density for heavily obscured agn .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the target selection , and the new data obtained from quasi - simultaneous observations with and _ swift_.  3.1 and  3.2 demonstrate that reflection is the dominant component of the hard x - ray spectra of these three agn . ",
    "3.3 provides a more detailed spectral analysis including the data .",
    "a comparison with the previously published x - ray results , as well as a discussion of the multi - wavelength properties and constraints on the agn geometry , is presented in  4 .",
    "we summarize our results in  5 . in this work",
    "we use standard cosmological parameters ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) to calculate distances . unless noted otherwise ,",
    "all uncertainties are given as 90% confidence intervals .",
    "the extragalactic survey program includes a wide - field shallow component ( average exposure of 20  ks ) in which the observatory is pointed towards a known agn previously detected with @xmath10 , or selected because of high obscuration inferred from soft x - ray ( @xmath13  kev ) observations .",
    "the wide field of view of the instrument and its nearly uniform coverage of the whole sky down to a sensitivity of @xmath14  erg  s@xmath15  @xmath1 in the 14195  kev band @xcite , provide a reasonable sample of predominantly local ( @xmath16 ) agn .",
    "its more uniform and deeper exposure of the sky away from the galactic plane compared to makes the survey source catalog an excellent starting point for selecting targets for more detailed spectroscopic studies , such as possible with @xmath10 .",
    "the targets were selected for observations from the catalog utilizing 54 months of bat operation @xcite . unless prevented by technical constraints , all targets in this program receive on average 7  ks of quasi - simultaneous coverage ( with delay of @xmath81 day ) in the soft x - ray band from the @xmath10 in order to enable spectral analysis over the broad 0.379  kev band .",
    "two of the targets presented here , ngc  424 ( tololo  0109383 ) and ngc  1320 , were selected from the 54-month catalog .",
    "the third target , ic  2560 , was selected from a sample of relatively faint agn with some indication of compton - thick obscuration from previous observations ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "soft x - ray spectroscopy , as well as multi - wavelength data , indirectly suggest that ngc  424 and ngc  1320 are also likely to be compton - thick @xcite .",
    "the selection of the sample presented here is based on a basic spectral analysis of all 20-ks snapshot observations of agn up to may 2013 .",
    "out of 34 observed agn we selected 3 that show the most prominent compton reflection component signature : very hard spectrum ( @xmath17 , assuming a simple power law model ) , strong compton hump ( high reflection fraction , @xmath18 , assuming the simplest reflection model ) and iron emission ( large equivalent width of the neutral iron k@xmath19 line , @xmath20  kev ) .",
    "this is not a uniformly selected , statistically complete sample  we will address such samples in future work .",
    "however , the hard x - ray properties of these three targets can be considered representative of a larger class of heavily obscured agn , which make up approximately 10% of the sample of nearby agn being surveyed with @xmath10 .",

    "we use version 12.8.1 @xcite for all our modeling .",
    "in addition , we : take into account redshifts and galactic absorption column density listed in table  [ tab : basic_data ] ; assume a contribution from a soft power law component ( @xmath38 ) with free normalization ; assume solar abundances and a high - energy cutoff in the nuclear continuum at 200  kev ; that the ngc  424 data are consistent with this value ; for the other two targets this parameter is unconstrained .",
    "this choice is consistent with the recent literature , e.g.,@xcite and @xcite . ]",
    "leave the cross - normalization constants between instruments to vary freely .",
    "we perform all parameter optimizations using the cash statistic @xcite , but report the @xmath39 values of each best fit due to their straightforward interpretability .",

    "the addition of two unresolved gaussian components ( @xmath41  kev ) at 6.40 and 7.06  kev , corresponding to neutral iron k@xmath19 and k@xmath42 lines , improves the fits significantly . although the reduced @xmath39 ( @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the number of degrees of freedom ) reaches @xmath451 for the case of ic  2560 and @xmath451.5 for the other two agn , the fits are difficult to justify physically . the best fits",
    "are all qualitatively the same : the intrinsic power law with a photon index which tends to @xmath46 is absorbed by a column density of @xmath47  @xmath1 , and the equivalent width of the gaussian component at the energy of the iron k@xmath19 line exceeds 2  kev .",
    "these values of @xmath48 are much harder than typical for the coronal continuum of agn , while the equivalent width of the iron line strongly indicates presence of a reflection component .",
    "the photon indices can be assumed to take on a typical value of 1.9 at a cost of increasing the @xmath39 , however the best fits remain qualitatively the same .",
    "they are shown for each of the three agn in the top panels of figure  [ fig : ss1 ] .",
    "we next add a reflection component , which we approximate using the pexrav model @xcite .",
    "this model produces the reflected continuum of an infinite slab of infinite optical depth , and is therefore only an approximation for the reflection off a distant torus .",
    "we apply this component to produce only the reflected continuum .",

    "we start our fitting procedure with both the transmitted and the reflected component .",
    "we also include narrow gaussian components at 6.40 and 7.06  kev and the soft @xmath49 power law .",
    "the basic result of the fitting is that the contribution of the transmitted components are minor for all three agn : the data requires either very high absorption column ( @xmath50  @xmath1 , which is the upper limit of the ` plcabs ` model ) , or zero normalization .    for ngc  424",
    "the best - fit column density is @xmath50  @xmath1 and the intrinsic power law continuum slope is @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) . if we fix the absorption column density at a lower value , the normalization of the transmitted component decreases until it becomes consistent with zero for @xmath53  @xmath1 .",
    "if the transmitted component is removed from the model altogether , the best fit ( @xmath54 ) is found for @xmath55 .",

    "the best - fit model ( @xmath62 ) is dominated by the reflection component , but does include a transmitted power - law component with @xmath63 and @xmath64  @xmath1 . simply removing the latter component",
    "degrades the fit only to @xmath65 .",
    "an alternative model , dominated by the ` plcabs ` component above 10  kev , can be found with the assumption of @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the models presented in this subsection are summarized in figure  [ fig : ss1 ] .",
    "for all three agn we find that a statistically good description of their hard x - ray spectra can be achieved using models consisting almost entirely of reflection components .",
    "however , with the quality of the data acquired in short 20-ks exposures it is not possible to exclude a minor contribution from a transmitted intrinsic continuum .",
    "the large equivalent width of the iron lines point towards strong reflection and essentially rule out the possibility that the hard x - ray spectrum is primarily due to the transmission of the intrinsic continuum through mildly compton - thick material .",
    "we further examine a set of more appropriate physically motivated models .",
    "an improvement over the approximation , which assumes infinite optical depth , is offered by theoretical models that use monte carlo simulations of the propagation of x - ray photons through material of finite optical depth in a physically motivated geometry .",
    "the first model of that kind is @xmath68   @xcite .",
    "the basis of the model is a literal torus with a 60@xmath69 half - opening angle .",
    "it consists of two main spectral components : a transmitted continuum component ( formally called zeroth - order continuum , mytz , by the authors of the model ) and a scattered one ( myts ; also referred to as reprocessed , or reflected ) .",
    "the former is produced by scattering photons _ away _ from the line of sight , while the latter is formed by photons scattered _ into _ the line of sight of the distant observer .",
    "we start with the complete model , which is characterized by a single column density ( @xmath70 , corresponding to the column density in the equatorial plane of the torus ) . the internal normalizations between the components are fixed .",
    "the first model we test is an edge - on torus with inclination fixed at 90@xmath69 .",
    "this model does not fit any of the and data considered here : the reduced @xmath39 values do not get any lower than 23 . note that these models are transmission - dominated and therefore formally similar ( but physically more appropriate ) to the plcabs - only model examined in  [ sec : modeling1 ] .",
    "next we fit for the inclination angle of the torus under different assumptions of the equatorial column density , @xmath71 , since a straightforward fit for both of those parameters is highly degenerate .",
    "the results are again qualitatively the same for all three agn , regardless of @xmath71 : the best - fit inclination angles are found to be close to @xmath72 , matching the opening angle of the torus .",
    "for example , at @xmath73  @xmath1 ( shown in the upper panels of figure  [ fig : ss2 ] ) , the best - fit inclinations are @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 degrees for ngc  424 , ngc  1320 and ic  2560 , respectively .",
    "the best - fit photon indices are @xmath77 for ngc  424 and @xmath78 for ngc  1320 , while for ic  2560 the fit runs into the upper domain limit of at @xmath79 .",
    "the fits are slightly better for higher assumed @xmath71 , but they never reach @xmath80 .",
    "most of the @xmath39 contribution comes from the iron line region , which we treat in more detail in  [ sec : modeling3 ] .",
    "these results can easily be understood as the tendency of the fit to maximize the contribution of the reflected component ( which increases with decreasing inclination , as the observer sees more of the inner far side of the torus ) , while not completely uncovering the source of the continuum at the center ( since in the line of sight the light suffers significant absorption by passing through the edge of the torus for any inclination greater than @xmath72 ) . in all cases the spectra are dominated by the reflection component , with only a minor contribution from transmission of the nuclear continuum along the line of sight .",
    "finally , we try a model in which the two spectral components of the model are treated independently . in this case , the transmitted zeroth - order continuum , mytz , and the scattered / reflection component , myts , have fixed inclination parameters ( 90@xmath69 for the former and 0@xmath69 for the latter ) , separate column densities ( @xmath59 and @xmath81 , respectively ) and a relative normalization ( @xmath82 ) different than unity .",
    "this again leads to solutions in which the reflection component dominates over the transmission component ( by a factor of @xmath83 , compared to the internal normalization of the complete model ) .",
    "however , the fit parameters are different for each agn , as shown in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : ss2 ] . for ngc  424",
    "we find that a transmission component with @xmath84  @xmath1 contributes significantly in the iron line region , while the reflection continuum dominates above 10  kev . in the case of ngc  1320",
    "the normalization of the transmitted component is consistent with zero .",
    "the lower quality of the ic  2560 spectum allows for a number of degenerate solutions that sensitively depend on the choice of assumptions . assuming @xmath85 as before , one interesting possible solution ( @xmath86 ) is reflection from compton - thin material ( @xmath87  @xmath1 ) dominating below 10  kev with a direct power law absorbed by @xmath88  @xmath1 dominating above that .",
    "removal of the latter component , however , leads to a slightly better reflection - only model ( @xmath89 ) , which we elaborate on in  [ sec : modeling3 ] . in conclusion , the physically motivated models of the agn torus , in addition to the phenomenological models presented in  [ sec : modeling1 ] , demonstrate that the observed spectra are consistent with being reflection - dominated .",
    "the conclusion of both of the preceeding two subsections is that the reflection - dominated models provide either better , or statistically equivalent but simpler , descriptions of the observed hard x - ray spectra compared to transmission - dominated or two - component models .",
    "here we summarize the results obtained with the simultaneous and data , and also consider the higher - quality , non - simultaneous , archival data . in order to avoid the complexities associated with the detailed modeling of the soft x - ray emission unrelated to the agn",
    ", we only use the data above 3  kev .",
    "the model parameters of interest are listed in table  [ tab : model_parameters ] .      before using the data from @xcite jointly with the data",
    ", we first checked whether the target changed dramatically in flux between the two observations .",
    "we construct a simple phenomenological model for the 310  kev region by fitting the spectrum with a continuum and gaussian components for 8 emission lines , fixed to the following energies : .",

    "we therefore conclude that the flux variability is not severe and proceed with a joint spectral analysis .    the best - fit approximate reflection - only model ( using @xmath10 ) for the ngc  424 data from and is found for @xmath55 , with @xmath54 .",

    "we therefore estimate that the intrinsic 210  kev luminosity of ngc  424 is @xmath262  erg  s@xmath15 . based only on data below 10  kev , @xcite infer a somewhat lower luminosity of @xmath263  erg  s@xmath15 . using broad - band data from and ( 0.6100  kev ) @xcite argued that under reasonable assumptions on geometry the intrinsic 210  kev luminosity could be as high as @xmath219  erg  s@xmath15 . with that luminosity ngc  424",
    "would closely match the intrinsic relation between @xmath247 and @xmath248 from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : luminosities ] ) .",
    "the adopted intrinsic luminosities may be converted to bolometric ones using empirical calibrations ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "we estimate the bolometric correction factors for both the mid - ir and 210  kev bands to be 1020 , not including the considerable intrinsic uncertainty of a factor @xmath453 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is then @xmath264  erg  s@xmath15 for ngc  424 and @xmath265  erg  s@xmath15 for ngc  1320 and ic  2560 .",
    "combined with the measured masses of the smbh harbored by the agn we can estimate their eddington fraction , @xmath266 , where @xmath267 is the bolometric luminosity and @xmath268 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "the mass of the smbh in ic  2560 has been measured dynamically using the water megamasers @xcite , while for ngc  424 and ngc  1320 it was infered from measurements of stellar velocity dispersion via the @xmath269 relation @xcite .",
    "using those values we infer eddington fractions of @xmath25% for ngc  424 ( @xmath270  ) and ngc  1320 ( @xmath271  ) , and @xmath230% for ic  2560 ( @xmath272  ) .",
    "the uncertainties on these values are likely up to a factor of 5 , but it is encouraging that the quantities are consistent with empirical correlations observed in large agn samples ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "we also find that the agn with the highest eddington fraction , ic  2560 , has the steepest photon index , in accordance with the statistical relation found by @xcite and consistent with the spread observed for individual sources in their sample .      by modeling the hard x - ray spectra of ngc  424 ,",
    "ngc  1320 and ic  2560 we have unambigously confirmed that the dominant component in their hard x - ray spectra is a reflection of the nuclear continuum from distant , cold material .",
    "although minor contributions from heavily absorbed intrinsic continua ( at the @xmath810% level ) can not be completely ruled out with the data from short exposures presented here , it is clear that the sources are reflection - dominated and therefore that their nuclear regions must be heavily obscured by compton - thick material .",
    "the type of reflection spectrum that fits all of the data best is the `` face - on '' component of the model , which can be envisioned as the component that remains when the observer looks down the axis of symmetry of the torus , but with the central region , from where the intrinsic continuum is emitted , blocked by a completely opaque patch . according to @xcite ,",
    "this component closely approximates the spectrum one would observe in the case of a uniform compton - thick torus being tilted towards the observer just enough for the far side of the torus to be visible in reflected light , but not enough to allow the nuclear continuum to be observable over the closer edge of the torus ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "although the inclination limits for the situation described above depend on the scale height of the gas and dust distribution , one can argue that if the obscuring material really does reside in a toroidal structure , its orientation with respect to the observer would need to be close to edge - on .",
    "this orientation is indeed plausible given that water megamaser emission has been observed in two out of three targets @xcite , with ic  2560 being well established as a classical disk megamaser ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a discussion of the possible disk / torus and masing clouds geometry ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the type of reflection spectrum that fits the data ( both `` face - on '' and models ) is more characteristic of surface scattering than scattering through dense material , which argues towards a tilted edge - on and possibly clumpy torus scenario , rather than complete enclosure in a spherical distribution of material .",
    "the model used here is uniform , has sharp edges and a fixed covering fraction of @xmath273 .",
    "these are approximations made in order to simplfy the model calculation ",
    "astrophysical tori are likely neither uniform , nor have an outer solid surface .",
    "for those reasons , a blind application of the literal torus in which one would fit for all free parameters of the model ( especially inclination ) may not be reasonable or even recommended @xcite .    from the multi - wavelength data presented in ",
    "[ sec : discussion - luminosities ] we infer a reflection efficiency in the 210  kev band of the order of 1% , broadly consistent with any torus orientation @xcite .",
    "in order to achieve the observed reflection dominance , the material surrounding the source must intercept a relatively large fraction of the nuclear luminosity ( i.e. ,  large covering fraction ) , while the side of the torus closer to the observer covers the direct line of sight with only a small global covering fraction  letting the bulk of the backside reflection spectrum pass through unimpeded .",
    "a compelling physical scenario may be that of a clumpy torus @xcite . in that case the central source would be surrounded by a large number of individual high - column - density clouds with a large global covering factor , but also plenty of essentially clear lines of sight for their reflection spectra to reach the observer . in the clumpy torus picture",
    "the complete extinction of the intrinsic continuum along the line of sight to the nucleus could be explained by a large inclination angle and larger density of clouds in the equatorial plane of the system , which is again consistent with the observations of megamasers .",
    "torus clumpiness also offers a natural explanation for the weak absorbed power law component required to model the ngc  424 spectrum : along some off - nuclear lines of sight there could be openings with relatively low column density ( @xmath274  @xmath1 , compared to the surrounding @xmath275  @xmath1 ) , through which we observe a weak continuum produced by optically thin thomson scattering of the nuclear continuum on free electrons .",
    "those free electrons are located in , or above , the opening of the torus and scatter the intrinsic continuum and the broad line region photons into our line of sight .",
    "this mechanism has already been invoked to explain the weak broad lines ( e.g. ,  h@xmath19 , h@xmath42 , fe  ii ) seen in the optical spectrum of ngc  424 , which is otherwise typical of a seyfert  2 agn @xcite , and the broad emission lines detected in polarized light @xcite , typical of type  1 agn with a `` hidden '' broad - line region . with newer data it is becoming possible to go beyond the simplistic type  1 and type  2 classification and more directly probe the geometry of the obscuring material .",
    "we have shown in previous sections that the infrared and the soft x - ray data , and especially the hard x - ray data from @xmath10 , unambigously confirm the heavy obscuration of the central source in ngc  424 regardless of the optical classification .    using high angular resolution interferometric data ,",
    "@xcite find that the dominant contribution to the nuclear mid - infrared flux comes from relatively cold optically - thin dust in a structure elongated in the direction of the torus axis of symmetry ( as determined from the spectropolarimetric data of @xcite ) .",
    "this observation suggests an interesting dust distribution in which optically thin clouds line the torus opening and possibly reach out to the narrow - line region ( see figure  9 in @xcite ) .",
    "there is a possibility that a fraction of the optically thick clumps that predominantly reside in the torus get entrained in a wind together with the optically thin clouds that dominate the mid - infrared output ; this is broadly consistent with our spectral modeling ( i.e.  symmetrically broadened neutral , and doppler - shifted ionized iron lines ; see  [ sec : modeling3-ngc424 ] ) .",
    "the example of ngc  424 highlights the importance of modeling the hard x - ray spectra of compton - thick agn in synergy between data from different spectral bands in order to probe the unresolved agn structure .",
    "the high degree of similarity with the circinus galaxy and ngc  1068 in both the interferometric mid - infrared data @xcite and the hard x - ray spectra from ( @xcite ; bauer @xmath10 , _ in prep .",
    "_ ) may be indicating that these objects are not merely isolated special cases . due to the lack of similar data for ngc  1320 and",
    "ic  2560 , at this point we can only speculate that they may exhibit a similar sort of geometry as ngc  1068 , circinus and ngc  424 , which are brighter and have higher - quality broadband data .",
    "further evidence for clumpiness of the obscuring matter surrounding the nuclei in general can be found in observations of dramatically changing column density in some nearby agn ( e.g.,@xcite ) , as well as the optical classification changes observed in at least a dozen agn up to date ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) . for ngc  424 and ic",
    "2560 no significant variaibility in absorption has been observed in the literature , but an optically thin scattering medium has been invoked in modeling of their soft x - ray spectra in some observations @xcite .",
    "we observe no spectral changes between three epochs of ngc  1320 observations and the data are currently not of sufficient quality to constrain a possible thomson - scattered continuum component .",
    "hard x - ray variability could in principle be used to further constrain the physical size of the torus ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , which might be possible with future repeated observations .",
    "the moderately large sample of nearby heavily obscured agn currently surveyed with will provide the high - quality hard x - ray data needed for such work in the near future .    ) for a range of column densities along the line of sight to the nucleus .",
    "thick colored lines correspond to tracks of best - fit models for ngc  424 ( red ) , ngc  1320 ( green ) and ic  2560 ( blue ) .",
    "the differences between the three thick colored tracks are mostly due to different intrinsic photon indices ; from 1.9 for ngc  1320 to 2.55 for ic  2560 ( 2.3 for ngc  424 ) . with thinner red lines we show the effect of changing the intrinsic photon index of ngc  424 by 0.05 and 0.1 in either direction .",
    "overplotted are data for the first 10 detected serendipitous sources ( squares , from @xcite ) and a lower limit for a heavily obscured sdss quasar ( diamond ) presented in @xcite .",
    "any source with a low count rate and a band ratio within the shaded grey area ( or higher ) may be considered a compton - thick agn candidate . however",
    ", the obscuration would need to be inferred from the mid - infrared , or other multi - wavelength data .",
    "[ fig : redshifting ] ]      the three sources presented here join a relatively small sample of nearby compton - thick agn that have been studied spectroscopically in some detail over the broad 0.2200  kev energy range ( e.g.,@xcite ) . opens up an opportunity to extend our empirical knowledge towards less luminous and more distant compton - thick agn , and ultimately understand their properties better .",
    "early results from the extragalactic surveys ( @xcite ; mullaney @xmath10 , _ in prep . _ ; civano @xmath10 , _ in prep . _ ) already include candidate conterparts to these local agn at higher redshift ( e.g. , @xmath276 , @xcite ; @xmath277 , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "short @xmath220-ks observations of obscured luminous quasars at low redshift ( @xmath278  erg  s@xmath15 , @xmath279 ; @xcite ) may reach sufficient photon statistics to enable modeling similar to that presented in this paper . however , for most of the high - redshift sources one is limited to using band ratios as indicators of their spectral shape . in figure",
    "[ fig : redshifting ] we show the ratio of counts in the 38 and 824  kev bands for @xmath280 compton - thick reflection - dominated agn ( @xmath281  @xmath1 ) with x - ray spectra equal to those of the three agn presented in this paper .",
    "their tracks cross those of compton - thin agn ( obscured by @xmath282  @xmath1 ) , showing that information beyond the band ratio is needed in order to isolate compton - thick agn .",
    "the distinction between compton - thick and compton - thin obscuration is of key importance in population studies ( e.g. , the distribution of @xmath59 in obscured agn ) and understanding of the cxb , since the agn obscured by @xmath283  @xmath1 contribute significantly more hard x - ray radiation per source @xcite .",
    "a three - band x - ray approach , similar to the one recently proposed by @xcite , or @xcite , would provide better means of discrimination between the levels of obscuration .",
    "however , at low number counts the uncertainties on band ratios in two bands can already be large , and dividing the data into three bands may not be beneficial .",
    "the possible confusion outlined in figure  [ fig : redshifting ] is aggravated by the fact that a spread in intrinsic photon indices exists in the population , as demonstrated by the differing photon indices of the three agn presented here .",
    "compared to the observed distribution of @xmath48 with a mean of 1.9 and an intrinsic width of a 0.3 ( e.g.@xcite ) , the photon indices determined from spectral analysis of the data span almost the full observed range , but do not represent extreme sources .",
    "the constant difference of approximately 0.4 between photon indices determined using the models and those determined using can be understood as arising from the different geometries and parameters assumed ; we explore those differences in detail in a forthcoming publication ( brightman @xmath10 , _ in prep . _ ) . as obscured agn studies expand to higher redshifts and lower luminosities , the variance of different systems will only increase , which further motivates establishing good spectral templates based on nearby objects such as the ones presented here .",
    "the typically low signal - to - noise ratio of sources identified in the blank - field surveys makes it difficult to distinguish different agn types based only on band ratios and it is therefore crucial to consider multi - wavelength data .",
    "for example , any source found to occupy the grey area in figure  [ fig : redshifting ] has a spectral slope consistent with a heavily compton - thick agn , but only those with an extreme @xmath237 ( as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : discussion - luminosities ] ) should be considered true candidates .",
    "a similar concept of compton - thick agn selection was employed by @xcite .",
    "many other studies of empirical multi - wavelength correlations and indirect obscuration indicators have been conducted in the past ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , directly or indirectly leading towards better selection criteria . with our small sample of three",
    ", we can identify the megamaser - biased selection of compton - thick agn in @xcite as potentially inadequate , as none of our sources ( despite two of them hosting water megamasers ) , would be classified as compton - thick based on their multi - wavelength selection criteria . perhaps owing to the similarity and simplicity of their spectra , all three sources generally pass the selection criteria proposed in the literature .",
    "in this paper we use the empirical correlations , mainly between @xmath247 and @xmath248 , in two ways : ( i ) assuming they hold for our sources , we infer that the intrinsic 210  kev luminosity has been suppressed by a factor of @xmath2100 , and ( ii ) having determined that the x - ray spectra are dominated by reflection , which is typically assumed to be of the order of 1% efficient in the 210  kev band , we verify that our sources still match the intrinsic relations and the compton - thick agn selection criteria . in that process",
    "we construct a complete self - consistent picture for each of our targets in order to provide a valuable benchmark for future multi - wavelength studies . with more precise measurements , better selection , tighter correlations and larger samples it will become possible to constrain the geometry of the circumnuclear material on statistical grounds and provide new tests for the contending agn models ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we present hard x - ray spectroscopy of three highly obscured , nearby seyfert nuclei : ngc  424 , ngc  1320 , and ic  2560 .",
    "observations unambiguosly confirm that they are among the most obscured agn in the local universe : the obscuration of the nuclei is well into the compton - thick regime , where the nuclear continuum is suppressed to the extent that the distant / cold reflection component dominates the x - ray spectrum above 3  kev .",
    "although hard x - ray data from nearly obscuration - unbiased surveys with and were previously able to provide basic fluxes and spectral shapes , with it is possible study moderately large samples of hard x - ray selected agn spectroscopically . with better understanding of local heavily obscured examples and their multi - wavelength properties",
    "we aim to achieve greater reliability in identifying their more distant counterparts .",
    "this will ultimately lead to improved indirect indicators that are often the only tools available for high - redshift agn studies .      *",
    "all three sources show strong fluorescent iron lines and prominent compton humps , as expected for reflection spectra .",
    "they stand out from the sample of local hard x - ray selected agn by their hard effective photon indices and very high reflection strength , if modeled with simple spectral models . from a preliminary analysis of the ongoing survey of nearby agn",
    ", we estimate that similar sources constitute approximately 10% of that currently incomplete sample . *",
    "detailed modeling reveals that the x - ray spectra above 3  kev are dominated by reflection components and that no contributions from heavily absorbed intrinsic continua are formally required by the data .",
    "we thus infer that in all three cases the intrinsic continuum is obscured by @xmath284  @xmath1 and find @xmath285  @xmath1 for the column density of the reflecting material .",
    "the dominance of the reflection component is further supported by the strong fluorescent fe  k@xmath19 lines with equivalent width of 12.5  kev .",
    "* as the intrinsic x - ray continua are not observed in transmission , we estimate their luminosities from multi - wavelength data , and infer a reflection efficiency of the order of 1% in the 210  kev band . based on that efficiency and the surface - type reflection that fits the data best we argue for an edge - on clumpy torus geometry .",
    "further studies of statistically representative samples of compton - thick agn are needed to constrain the typical reflection efficiency , which is currently only assumed to be of the order of 1% in cxb models . *",
    "considering the extension of compton - thick agn studies to the high - redshift , low - count regime , we show that the band count ratio in the bandpass is not a good discriminator between mildly and heavily compton - thick sources at @xmath280 and advocate usage of mid - infrared data to infer obscuration or reflection dominance . in that context",
    ", we use archival multi - wavelength data to verfy that ( i ) our sources obey intrinsic luminosity relations derived empiricaly from large agn samples , and ( ii ) they would not miss being classified as compton - thick agn using most of the selection techniques proposed in the literature .",

    "<S> we present x - ray spectral analyses for three seyfert  2 active galactic nuclei , ngc  424 , ngc  1320 , and ic  2560 , observed by in the 379  kev band . </S>",
    "<S> the high quality hard x - ray spectra allow detailed modeling of the compton reflection component for the first time in these sources . using quasi - simultaneous and data , as well as archival data , </S>",
    "<S> we find that all three nuclei are obscured by compton - thick material with column densities in excess of @xmath0  @xmath1 , and that their x - ray spectra above 3  kev are dominated by reflection of the intrinsic continuum on compton - thick material . due to the very high obscuration , absorbed intrinsic continuum components </S>",
    "<S> are not formally required by the data in any of the sources . </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the intrinsic photon indices and the column density of the reflecting medium through the shape of the reflection spectra . using archival multi - wavelength data </S>",
    "<S> we recover the intrinsic x - ray luminosities consistent with the broadband spectral energy distributions . </S>",
    "<S> our results are consistent with the reflecting medium being an edge - on clumpy torus with a relatively large global covering factor and overall reflection efficiency of the order of 1% . given the unambiguous confirmation of the compton - thick nature of the sources , we investigate whether similar sources are likely to be missed by commonly used selection criteria for compton - thick agn , and explore the possibility of finding their high - redshift counterparts . </S>"
