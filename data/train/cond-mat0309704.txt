    "silicon carbide is an important wide band gap semiconductor which offers a variety of applications for high power and high frequency devices . during device processing ,",
    "various intrinsic defects are introduced that affect the electronic properties of the material .",
    "the mobile intrinsic defects , namely vacancies and interstitials , play a pivotal role in self diffusion and dopant diffusion as well as in the annealing of ion - implanted material .",
    "substitutional impurities are _ per se _ immobile . they need vacancies or interstitials as vehicles for the migration .",
    "the rapid diffusion in the course of annealing can considerably affect the implanted dopant profiles .",
    "for example , a transient enhanced dopant diffusion was observed in boron@xcite and aluminum@xcite implanted 4h - sic .",
    "it is initiated by an excess concentration of intrinsic defects , most likely silicon interstitials as the analysis of recent experiments indicates@xcite in contrast to the earlier assumption@xcite of a vacancy - mediated mechanism .",
    "similar mechanisms are operative in the more fundamental self diffusion . as a matter of fact , a microscopic understanding of the mechanisms underlying the self diffusion should provide insight into the mechanisms of the dopant diffusion . in the most recent studies@xcite of self diffusion in 3c- and",
    "4h - sic diffusion constants have been measured for the carbon and silicon self diffusion .",
    "the basic diffusion mechanisms , however , have not been unraveled . in particular , the role of interstitials and vacancies in different diffusion processes remains open for both polytypes .    alongside with the diffusion , the annealing of mobile intrinsic defects contains information about the migration of vacancies and interstitials .",
    "the annealing of vacancy - related defects has been studied by positron annihilation spectroscopy ( pas)@xcite and electron paramagnetic resonance techniques ( epr)@xcite in irradiated material .",
    "the identification of the epr - centers as isolated silicon@xcite and carbon@xcite vacancies has been verified theoretically.@xcite it was found that the annealing behavior of carbon and silicon vacancies shows striking differences . for example , in epr - experiments@xcite the silicon vacancy was found to anneal in several stages at 150@xmath1c , 350@xmath1c and 750@xmath1c , whereas for the carbon vacancy a single characteristic annealing temperature of 500@xmath1c was observed.@xcite recently , an epr - center was observed by epr experiments@xcite in material annealed above 750@xmath1c and interpreted as a vacancy - antisite complex .",
    "this complex may be a decay product of the metastable silicon vacancy ( in _ p_-type and intrinsic material ) as predicted by theory.@xcite a comprehensive interpretation of annealing experiments in terms of elementary processes crucially depends on an understanding of the underlying diffusion mechanisms of intrinsic defects .",
    "theoretical investigations by _ ab initio _ methods can provide important insight in a microscopic picture of the self- and dopant - diffusion as well as the annealing kinetics . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the mobile intrinsic defects and their migration mechanisms in 3c - sic using a method based on density functional theory .",
    "the frenkel pair recombination and other diffusion - controlled annealing mechanisms are treated elsewhere.@xcite our investigation is based on recent theoretical studies of the ground state properties of vacancies@xcite and antisites@xcite and addresses interstitials and vacancy - antisite - complexes that are relevant for the migration .",
    "we show that different types of silicon interstitials , which have entirely different migration paths , are important in _ p_-type and _ n_-type material .",
    "the metastability of the silicon vacancy in _ p_-type material is demonstrated to have strong implications for vacancy - assisted diffusion mechanisms .",
    "the considered diffusion processes are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : scn.diff ] , which shows the most important migration channels for vacancies and interstitials in 3c - sic .",
    "we find that interstitials are by far more mobile than vacancies and therefore play a prominent role in diffusion .",
    "we also demonstrate that the diffusion mechanisms strongly depend on the charge state of the mobile defects .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "beginning with a description of the method in section  [ sec : dft ] we turn to the ground state properties of interstitials , vacancies and vacancy - antisite - complexes in section [ sec : i ] and [ sec : v ]",
    ". the migration mechanisms of vacancies and interstitials are analyzed in section  [ sec : v.i.mig ] .",

    "we carried out first principles calculations using the plane wave pseudopotential package  @xcite within the framework of density functional theory ( dft).@xcite the local density approximation  @xcite ( lda ) is employed for the exchange - correlation functional and spin effects are included within the lsda where necessary .",
    "we describe the intrinsic defects and their environment using periodic supercells .",
    "large supercells with 64 and 216 crystal lattice sites are used .",
    "the electron transitions between the defect and its periodic images give rise to the formation of defect bands and affect the defect energetics .",
    "this artificial defect - defect interaction can be efficiently reduced by a special k - point sampling.@xcite a special k - point mesh  @xcite with 8 k - points in the brillouin zone ( 2@xmath82@xmath82-mesh ) provides converged defect energies for the 64-atom cell .",
    "it is crucial to preserve the correct degeneracy of the isolated defect levels , as the degeneracy may lead to a jahn - teller instability . in those cases , where symmetry - lowering jahn - teller - distortions are important",
    ", we perform the calculations using only the @xmath9-point in a 216 atom cell ( for which already sufficiently converged formation energies are obtained ) , with the exact point symmetry of an isolated defect . in the case of charged defects",
    "we follow the approximate procedure of makov and payne  @xcite to account for the electrostatic interaction of the periodically arranged defects as well as their interaction with the compensating background .",
    "the relevance of such corrections has been already pointed out by torpo _",
    "et  al . _ for the vacancies in 4h - sic.@xcite especially for the highly charged interstitial defects this procedure improves the defect energetics considerably . in fig .",
    "[ fig : madelung ] we demonstrate this for the carbon - coordinated silicon interstitial si@xmath6 ( cf .",

    "we find that the completely ionized interstitial silicon ( charge state 4@xmath10 ) is strongly screened by the surrounding lattice .",
    "a comparison of the formation energies calculated for the 64 and 216 atom cell with and without the madelung correction shows indeed that the correction leads to a more consistent description .",
    "whereas we obtain 0.5ev and 1.9ev without the correction using special k - points , the corrected results of 4.23ev and 4.47ev agree to within 0.24ev . here",

    "the extrapolation of @xmath19 obtained in the 216 atom cell to the isolated defect using the monopole correction is shown by the solid line . ]",
    "soft norm - conserving pseudopotentials of the troullier - martins type  @xcite and a plane - wave basis set are employed .",
    "the carbon pseudopotential has been optimized for calculations with a small basis set ( matching radii @xmath20=1.6bohr , @xmath21=1.7bohr and @xmath22=1.5bohr ) . for the silicon potential the standard parameters are used . with these pseudopotentials and a basis set including plane waves of a kinetic energy up to 30ry defect formation energies",
    "have been calculated with a basis set induced convergence error below 0.1ev ( for an energy cut - off of 40ry all energy differences are converged ) . for each defect",
    "the coordinates of all atoms in the supercell have been relaxed .",
    "this is essential to obtain a correct energetic description .      as a guide through the hierarchy of intrinsic defects one often uses their relative abundance in thermodynamic equilibrium . at constant volume",
    "the concentration of defects is determined by the free energy of defect formation @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the concentration of the sites that are open to the defect , @xmath26 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath27 is the temperature .",
    "the free energy of formation is specified by the formation energy @xmath28 and the formation entropy @xmath29 of the defect : @xmath30 usually the defect abundance is well described by the formation energy @xmath31 alone . even though the formation entropy may amount up to 10@xmath32 ( values of about 8@xmath32",
    "have been recently reported for vacancies in si  @xcite and gaas  @xcite ) , its contribution can be relevant only at fairly high temperatures and for defects with comparable formation energies .    in the compound material",
    "sic the equilibrium defect concentration depends on the chemical environment which is characterized by the carbon and silicon chemical potentials , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the chemical potentials may vary only within certain bounds to prevent the formation of other more stable phases than sic . in excess of carbon ( c - rich conditions )",
    "such a phase can be graphite . in the other extreme ( si - rich conditions",
    ") , this would be crystalline silicon .",
    "the formation energy of a defect is calculated as  @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the total energy of the defect supercell , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the number of carbon and silicon atoms in the supercell . in case of an ionized defect , @xmath39 is the number of excess electrons transferred from the fermi - level @xmath40 to the localized defect levels ( for positively charged defects @xmath39 is negative ) . in equilibrium ,",
    "the chemical potentials of the environment @xmath41 and @xmath34 are related to the chemical potential of the crystal @xmath42 by @xmath43 . with this relation",

    "these substitutions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : form.raw ] ) yield @xmath47 where @xmath48 is expressed by the number of the involved atoms and chemical potentials , which are obtained by total energy calculations for the perfect crystals . as described above",
    ", neither @xmath33 nor @xmath34 can exceed the values of the corresponding bulk phases ( graphite or diamond and silicon ) .",
    "therefore @xmath46 may vary only between the negative heat of formation of the corresponding polytype @xmath49 and 0 ( c - rich and si - rich conditions , respectively ) .",
    "our calculated value of the heat of formation amounts to 0.61ev and depends only slightly on the polytype .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the value of 0.58ev obtained by zywietz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and slightly lower than the experimental value of 0.72ev .",
    "here we have deliberately chosen diamond as the reference .",
    "this choice is comparable to the alternative choice of graphite due to the small energy difference between graphite and diamond .",
    "note that our definition of the formation energy @xmath50 is independent of this aspect .",
    "the value of @xmath50 of ref .   is retained by evaluating e@xmath51 for @xmath52 . for the calculation of charged defects",
    "it is convenient to state the value of the fermi - level @xmath40 relative to the valence band edge @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the energy @xmath50 is given by the formula @xmath54 the value of @xmath53 is not reliably accessible in the calculation of the involved defects .",
    "therefore we take the value @xmath53 from a calculation for the perfect crystal and remove shifts in the average potential by aligning the bulk - spectrum features in the density of states of the defect cell and the defect - free cell .",
    "the alignment is consistent within 0.06ev over the whole energy range . by this procedure",
    "we also verified that the defect cells contain a sufficiently large bulk - like environment around the defect .",
    "the realization of a specific charge state of a deep defect for a given fermi - level @xmath55 requires that the formation energy of the defect in the corresponding charge state is lower than for the other possible charge states and that all occupied single particle levels lie below the conduction band edge .",
    "even though the kohn - sham levels have no physical interpretation by the design of the theory ( only the electron density and the total energy are a well defined quantities ) , they reproduce the experimental quasi - particle band structure quite well . yet ,",
    "the calculated kohn - sham band gaps are usually smaller than experimental values ( in 3c - sic and 4h - sic we obtain 1.2ev and 2.2ev as compared to the experimental findings of 2.39ev and 3.27ev ) . in this paper",
    "we follow a common practice ( cf .",
    "e.g. ref .  ) and use the experimental value for the conduction band edge . with this approach",
    "it is not possible to unambiguously determine the charge states that are only stable in a region close to the conduction band edge .",
    "the thermodynamic ionization level of a charged defect is given by the value of the fermi - level at which the defect alters its charge state .",
    "it is obtained from the formation energy by @xmath56 here @xmath57 and @xmath58 indicate the different charge states of the defect . usually only one electron is transfered between the electron reservoir and the defect levels .",
    "a simultaneous transfer of two electrons is unfavorable due to the cost of the effective electron - electron repulsion .",
    "however , in some cases  @xcite the electron - electron repulsion can be compensated by a configurational relaxation arising from a strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "this effect , known as the negative-@xmath59 effect , leads to an attractive effective electron - electron interaction and the ionization level @xmath60 appears below @xmath61 .",
    "in order to analyze possible migration paths of interstitials and vacancies we apply two different standard methods . for the interstitial migration we use an implementation  @xcite of the ridge method of ionova and carter.@xcite in this method ,",
    "a saddle point search is conducted for given initial and final configurations of the migration event , both configurations being slightly distorted towards each other .",
    "the two configurations are iterated such that they approach each other and the energy barrier along the line connecting the two configurations is minimized . by this procedure",
    "both configurations converge to the saddle point and the lowest migration energy barrier @xmath62 is obtained .",
    "the search is repeated for all relevant charge states and the obtained transition states are analyzed .",
    "this automatic search of the saddle point fails when defect levels of different symmetry cross along the migration path . in this situation , which applies to the migration of vacancies",
    ", we analyze the potential energy surface using the drag method .",
    "this approach has been previously employed in a study of the gallium vacancy migration in gaas.@xcite for a relevant set of coordinates ( reaction coordinates ) , the potential energy surface is calculated by constraining the coordinates of interest and minimizing the total energy for all remaining coordinates .",
    "the consistency of our choice of the reaction coordinates is verified .",

    "sic as a compound semiconductor possesses various interstitial configurations , some of them being distinguished only by a carbon- or silicon - like environment .",
    "important interstitial configurations are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : isi ] .",
    "there are tetrahedral configurations with either four silicon or carbon neighbors and a hexagonal configuration .",
    "besides these , split - interstitial configurations and bond - center configurations can exist . in a split configuration an interstitial silicon atom shares a site with a lattice atom , which could be either carbon or silicon .",
    "these dumbbell - like interstitials occur with orientations of the atom pair in the @xmath63- and the @xmath0-directions . in a bond - center configuration",
    "the interstitial silicon is centered at the bond of two neighboring lattice atoms .",
    "we have considered all of the above configurations in our investigation .",
    "the hexagonal and bond - center interstitials as well as the split - interstitials on the carbon sublattice turned out to be unstable in all relevant charge states .",

    "( [ eq : form ] ) more transparent , we consider the case @xmath65 , i.e. si - rich conditions , in figs .",
    "[ fig : isi ] and [ fig : ic ] . since in case of silicon interstitials @xmath66 , their formation energies rise by 0.61ev when referring to c - rich conditions , while the formation energy of the silicon vacancy drops by the same amount .",
    "the charge states of the defects in the different ranges of @xmath55 are indicated . except for the split - interstitial si@xmath67 all silicon interstitials are positively charged .",
    "the hierarchy of silicon interstitials strongly depends on the position of the fermi - level .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of the existence of the deep interstitial levels . in _",
    "p_-type material the most abundant is the tetrahedrally carbon - coordinated interstitial si@xmath68 followed by the split - interstitial si@xmath67 . around mid - gap , this ordering changes : as the interstitial si@xmath69 is completely ionized ( carrying a charge of 4@xmath10 ) its formation energy rises more rapidly than that of the si@xmath67 interstitial , which is neutral for @xmath55 around mid - gap . for si@xmath6 we can only estimate the formation energy of the charge states 3@xmath10 ( c.f .",
    "this also applies for the split - interstitial si@xmath4 .",
    "therefore we have plotted the formation energy only up to the estimated position of the lowest ionization level .",
    "the tetrahedrally silicon - coordinated interstitial si@xmath70 and the split - interstitial with @xmath63-orientation have a higher formation energy than the other stable configurations .    in the following",
    "we describe the electronic structure of silicon interstitials .",
    "the interstitial si@xmath69 does not introduce deep levels into the band gap .",
    "the silicon atom loses its valence electrons and becomes completely ionized .",
    "however , the interaction with the carbon and silicon neighbors induces an electron flow to the silicon interstitial , resulting in an electron distribution that resembles that at a regular silicon lattice site .",
    "s_- and _ p_-components of the electron density integrated over a sphere with a radius of 1.75bohr ( half the nearest neighbor distance in sic ) around the si - atom deviate from the values for a silicon site in a perfect crystal by less than 1% .",
    "this is also true for spheres of smaller radii . in fig .",
    "[ fig : n.sitc ] we have plotted the charge redistribution @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the electron density of the supercell containing the interstitial and @xmath73 refers to the density of the perfect crystal .",
    "the polarization of the surrounding carbon - silicon bonds and the formation of bonds with the silicon interstitial is clearly visible .",
    "although we have not found any localized one - particle levels within the band gap , we do not expect the charge state 4@xmath10 to persist throughout the whole experimental band gap .",
    "indeed , slightly above the experimental conduction band energy we observe a localized state . due to the large charge state correction",
    "the corresponding ionization level @xmath74 lies substantially lower , in a region somewhat above the experimental mid - gap .",
    "thus the charge state 4@xmath10 should be stable at least up to the mid - gap position of the fermi - level . yet",
    ", the quantitative determination of the ionization level is not possible in dft - lsda calculations due to the well - known band gap problem .",
    "the localized level is in resonance with the kohn - sham ( and experimental ) conduction band . to obtain their relative position ( which is crucial for a correct occupation of levels )",
    "one would have to apply a xc - discontinuity correction to the conduction band and the localized state , which is well beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "this problem is less acute in 4h - sic , where the band gap is substantially wider .",
    "we found  @xcite that the carbon - coordinated si - interstitial in 4h - sic possesses a similar ionization level @xmath74 and a corresponding one - particle state that is located within the kohn - sham band gap .",

    "the large variation of the experimental activation energies between 3c - sic and 4h - sic is surprising . besides the poly - crystalline nature of the cubic material , an incomplete point defect equilibrium or the preferential injection of either vacancies or interstitials at the interface of the tracer material and sic may be responsible .",

    "this finding inevitably affects the given prefactor and activation energies .      in sic , dopant atoms may substitute for carbon or silicon .",
    "for example , aluminum and phosphorus are known to preferentially bind to the silicon sublattice  @xcite and nitrogen prefers carbon sites.@xcite boron is predicted to bind either to the carbon or silicon sublattice  @xcite depending on the stoichiometry of the sample ( c / si - ratio ) .",
    "the migration of these dopants is mediated by mobile intrinsic defects . a mobile vacancy and a substitutional dopant atom may form a mobile dopant - vacancy - complex . an attractive interaction within the mobile pair",
    "enables migration until the pair eventually dissociates .",
    "mobile interstitials may initiate a migration of the dopant by a kick - out reaction .    in equilibrium , the dominating mechanism of dopant diffusion",
    "depends not only on the involved migration barriers but also on the abundance of the involved intrinsic defects .",
    "a transient enhanced dopant diffusion that was recently observed for boron  @xcite and aluminum  @xcite is triggered by an excess concentration of intrinsic defects , generated for example by the dopant implantation .",
    "assuming that a similar amount of interstitials and vacancies is generated , the migration barriers for different mechanisms are the relevant quantities to compare .",
    "naturally , for dopants on the carbon and the silicon sublattice different migration mechanisms apply .",
    "even though the migration mechanism should certainly be dopant - dependent , some general conclusions about the dopant diffusion can be drawn from our results for the diffusion of vacancies and interstitials .",
    "first of all , the availability of the mobile defects depends on the doping conditions .",
    "the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] showed that a mechanism based on silicon vacancies is not available in _ p_-type material .",
    "the metastability of v@xmath3 in _ p_-type material should affect dopant complexes with a silicon vacancy in a similar way .",
    "thus only the migration of a donor complex that involves the carbon vacancy should be relevant .",
    "in such a complex the dopant and the vacancy may be nearest neighbors or second nearest neighbors , when the dopant substitutes for silicon or carbon , respectively . whereas the migration of the second neighbor pair proceeds entirely on the carbon sublattice by second neighbor hops , the migration of the nearest - neighbor pair involves an initial exchange of the dopant and the vacancy and further migration of the vacancy around the dopant.@xcite this",
    "may only be accomplished by second neighbor hops . a mechanism based on",
    "nearest neighbor hops fails as the necessary v@xmath3-si@xmath2-complexes are unstable . in _",
    "n_-type material a mechanism based on silicon vacancies becomes available . with the same arguments as above a migration",
    "will involve only second neighbor hops of the vacancy .",
    "consequently , the diffusion of acceptors on the silicon sublattice most likely is mediated by silicon interstitials in _ p_-type material .",
    "more general conclusions on the role of the mechanisms based on carbon and silicon interstitials are not possible . here",
    "we only note that carbon - interstitials and silicon - interstitials ( in compensated and _ n_-type material ) have lower migration barriers than the corresponding vacancies .",
    "the interstitial mediated dopant migration may be limited by the availability of interstitials and the barriers associated with the migration of the dopant interstitial .",
    "these arguments are supported by our findings for boron  @xcite and by recent experiments on the diffusion of boron  @xcite and aluminum.@xcite our calculations reveal that a migration via the nearest - neighbor complex b@xmath3-v@xmath2 is unlikely .",
    "the barrier of the initial transformation has a similar magnitude as the transformation of v@xmath2-c@xmath3 into v@xmath3 in _ p_-type material .",
    "furthermore , the nearest - neighbor complex b@xmath3-v@xmath2 is practically unstable in _ p_-type material .",
    "the migration of the second - neighbor complex b@xmath2-v@xmath2 consists of three hops and involves migration barriers in _ p_-type material of as much as 5.6ev , which exceeds the barrier for the carbon vacancy .",
    "we find much lower migration barriers for a kick - out mechanism by silicon interstitials ( b@xmath3 ) or carbon interstitials ( b@xmath2 ) and a subsequent migration of the boron - interstitials .",
    "though earlier experiments  @xcite favored a vacancy related mechanism , the recent quantitative modeling of boron diffusion experiments  @xcite attribute the diffusion to a kick - out mechanism based on silicon interstitials .",
    "a similar conclusion was suggested by co - implantation experiments.@xcite here the transient enhanced diffusion observed after boron implantation was suppressed by carbon co - implantation and elevated by silicon co - implantation .",
    "a picture of the defect migration has been derived from theoretical investigations based on an _ ab initio _ method within the framework of dft .",
    "the analysis of the microscopic structure , the abundance and the migration mechanisms of interstitials and vacancies contribute to this picture .",
    "a strong influence of the doping conditions is reported for the mobile silicon defects . among the silicon interstitials two different interstitial configurations are relevant , the tetrahedrally carbon - coordinated interstitial in _ p_-type material and the split - interstitial in compensated and _ n_-type material .",
    "this affects the interstitial migration in _ p_-type material : the migration of the tetrahedrally carbon - coordinated interstitial is slower than the migration of the split - interstitial .",
    "a metastability of the silicon vacancy occurs in _ p_-type and compensated material .",
    "it transforms into the more stable carbon vacancy - antisite complex .",
    "this transformation of the silicon vacancy is more likely than its migration .",
    "the thermal activation of the reverse process determines the mobility of the vacancy - antisite complex .",
    "a central result is the finding that interstitials are more mobile than vacancies .    the importance of interstitials and vacancies in the self and dopant diffusion is determined by their abundance and diffusivity .",

    "for instance , silicon interstitials dominate the silicon self diffusion in _ p_-type material .",
