    "at present , it is still an open question in the high energy physics community whether the discovered new scalar particle at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite is actually the higgs boson of the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) .",
    "this new particle seems to behave as the sm higgs boson , and the most recent combined measurement of its mass by the atlas and cms collaborations set @xmath12 125.09 @xmath13 0.21 ( stat . )",
    "@xmath13 0.11 ( syst . ) gev  @xcite .",
    "however , many more measurements and data will be needed to extract reliable conclusions .",
    "it is worth noticing that the study of perturbativity and stability of the sm higgs boson potential suggests that , given the measured higgs boson mass , new physics must be present before the planck scale  @xcite . apart from the introduction of new particles ,",
    "extensions of the sm scalar sector may affect the properties of the sm - like higgs boson discovered at the lhc .",
    "experimental data is being used to constrain these extensions . among the minimal extensions of the sm",
    "is the inclusion of additional higgs bosons . in the two - higgs - doublet models ( 2hdm )",
    "one additional higgs doublet is introduced and five physical higgs bosons are obtained  @xcite : two",
    "cp - even scalars ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , one cp - odd scalar ( @xmath16 ) , and a charged higgs pair ( @xmath17 ) ; being the lightest higgs boson very similar to the sm one in the so - called _ decoupling limit _  @xcite . the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite ,",
    "one of the most - predictive frameworks beyond the sm , also contains two higgs doublets with a light neutral scalar boson compatible with the existing measurements , including the recently discovered higgs boson . in this letter",
    "we approach the question of the existence of an extended higgs structure beyond the sm by investigating the neutral higgs sector of various types of models .",
    "we consider in this work the ratio of branching ratios of a neutral higgs boson @xmath15  @xcite , @xmath18 analyzing in detail the yukawa - coupling effects and their phenomenological consequences . at leading order , in either the sm , the 2hdm or the mssm ,",
    "this ratio is given by just the ratio of squared ( running ) masses : @xmath19 however , this ratio receives large renormalization - scheme independent radiative corrections in supersymmetric ( susy ) models at large @xmath20 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values .",
    "these corrections are insensitive to the susy mass scale ( @xmath21 ) and absent in the sm or 2hdm .",
    "therefore , this ratio is a discriminant quantity between susy and non - susy models .",
    "the leading radiative corrections to this ratio can be cast into an effective yukawa susy coupling @xmath22 , and summarized in a simple correction factor @xmath23  @xcite , thus for a down - type quark or a charged lepton one can write : @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the running fermion mass , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the vacuum expectation values ( _ v.e.v.s _ ) of the two higgs doublets ; being @xmath26 the one giving mass to down - type quarks and charged leptons , @xmath28 is the ratio of the _ v.e.v.s _ and @xmath29 is the sm _ v.e.v_. this expression includes all possible @xmath30 enhanced corrections of the type @xmath31  @xcite correctly resumed .",
    "the leading part of the ( potentially ) non - decoupling contributions proportional to the trilinear soft - susy - breaking coupling @xmath32 can be absorbed in the definition of the effective yukawa coupling at low energies and only subleading effects survive  @xcite .",
    "therefore , expression  ( [ eq : deffhb ] ) contains all leading potentially large radiative effects .",
    "the resummation of the two - loop dominant corrections for large values of @xmath3 has been calculated in  @xcite .",
    "the interplay between higgs physics and susy , with the inclusion of radiative corrections , has been extensively discussed in the literature , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that the susy radiative corrections to the couplings of the higgs bosons to bottom quarks can be significant for large values of @xmath20 , and that they do not decouple in the limit of a heavy supersymmetric spectrum  @xcite , opposite to their behavior in electroweak gauge boson physics  @xcite .",
    "the partial decay width @xmath33 of the lightest supersymmetric neutral higgs particle has received particular attention .",
    "the complete one - loop corrections have been studied in  @xcite , and comprehensive studies of the one- and two - loop susy - qcd corrections are also available in  @xcite and  @xcite . the effective lagrangian description of the @xmath34 vertex and the implications for higgs - boson searches from susy effects can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the decoupling properties of the susy - qcd corrections to @xmath33 have been extensively discussed in  @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "the analysis of @xmath35 was presented in  @xcite .",
    "the observable @xmath0 , as the ratio of the two last mentioned processes , has been also analyzed in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "some recent analyses of these two branching ratios and other higgs decay modes , confronting lhc data with the mssm predictions , can be found , for example , in  @xcite .",
    "the ratio  ( [ eq : rdef ] ) is very interesting from both the experimental and the theoretical sides .",
    "it is a clean observable , measurable in a counting experiment , with only small systematic errors since most of them cancel in the ratio .",
    "the only surviving systematic effect results from the efficiency of @xmath36- and @xmath37-tagging . from the theoretical point of view , it is independent of the production mechanism of the decaying neutral higgs boson and of its total width . therefore , new - physics effects affecting the production cross - section do not appear in the ratio and also this observable is insensitive to unknown higher order qcd corrections to higgs boson production . besides , since this ratio only depends on the ratio of the masses  ( [ eq : rteosm ] )",
    ", there is no other parameter ( e.g.   @xmath38 ) that could absorb the large quantum corrections .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the ratio of the higgs boson decay rates into @xmath37 quarks and @xmath36  leptons  ( [ eq : rdef ] ) normalized to the standard model expectation @xmath39 is a very efficient quantity to distinguish a general 2hdm from the mssm , whose higgs sector could be fully covered at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "this normalized value is a function depending only on @xmath30 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , and encoding all the genuine susy corrections .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath41 and @xmath42 at the one - loop level can be obtained approximately by computing the supersymmetric loop diagrams at zero external momentum ( @xmath43 )  @xcite .",
    "these two quantities are independent of the susy mass scale @xmath21 since they only depend on @xmath30 and the ratio @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the conclusions about the sensitivity to the susy nature of the higgs sector through the analysis of the ratio @xmath0 are independent of the scale of the susy masses .    nowadays",
    ", the experiments at the lhc become increasingly sensitive to the higgs boson couplings .",
    "cms and atlas have indeed performed a generic fit to higgs - boson coupling ratios . in order to carry out this analysis",
    ", they define a set of higgs boson couplings normalized to the sm ones , @xmath45 , and the production rates measurements give a measurement of the coupling ratios for two particles : @xmath46 in the present work , we are interested in the bottom - quark and @xmath36-lepton measurements , for which cms and atlas collaborations provide  @xcite @xmath47 besides , the expected accuracy for the measurement of the fundamental higgs couplings @xmath48 and @xmath49 in future course of the lhc run corresponds to an uncertainty of @xmath50-@xmath51 ( @xmath37 quarks ) and @xmath52-@xmath53 ( @xmath36 leptons ) , going down to @xmath54-@xmath55 and @xmath56-@xmath57 for the high luminosity lhc ( hl - lhc ) . at the linear collider ( lc )",
    "the expected uncertainty is smaller , @xmath58 for @xmath48 coupling and @xmath59 for @xmath49 coupling  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the present experimental results on the higgs boson mass and couplings in the analysis of the ratio  ( [ eq : rdef ] ) as well as the expected future precision , and discuss the possibility to discriminate between models at various levels of future accuracy .",
    "in section  [ matanb ] we present the relevant expressions for our study and analyze the ratio @xmath0 ( eq .  ( [ eq : rdef ] ) ) in view of the present lhc data on higgs boson coupling ratios as given in  ( [ eq : lambdasexps ] ) .",
    "section  [ sensitivities ] is devoted to the analysis of the future sensitivities of this ratio at present and future colliders , and the study of the potential discrimination between susy or non - susy models .",
    "finally , the conclusions of this work are summarized in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we concentrate on the analysis of the ratio @xmath0 defined in  ( [ eq : rdef ] ) for the cases of the lightest cp - even higgs boson , @xmath14 . for the sake of the discussion and the analysis it will be useful to introduce the ratio @xmath0  ( [ eq : rdef ] ) normalized to the sm value for equal values of the higgs boson mass . for a higgs boson @xmath60",
    "we define : @xmath61 we can write this normalized ratio for each neutral mssm higgs boson in terms of the non - decoupling quantities @xmath41 and @xmath42 as  @xcite @xmath62 in  @xcite , by assuming a @xmath63 measurement of this ratio for the lightest higgs boson at the lhc  @xcite , it was found that one can be sensitive to the susy nature of the lightest higgs boson @xmath14 for @xmath64   up to @xmath65 in the most favorable scenario , being up to @xmath66 in some other regions . nowadays , the combination of the lhc coupling measurements of eq .",

    "( [ eq : lambdasexps ] ) we obtain : @xmath68 in this work we consider this experimental determination and we discuss their phenomenological consequences through the analysis of the normalized ratio @xmath69  ( [ eq : xnorm ] ) in different susy scenarios . besides , we also include in our numerical analysis a combined analysis of cms and atlas results . from the generic fit to higgs coupling ratios given above one can determine the values of these coupling ratios to be @xmath70 we obtain these values by using the procedure for combination of results described in  @xcite . as a consequence",
    "we get a value for the ratio of @xmath71 the one - standard deviation ( 68% c.l . )",
    "favored bands on @xmath69  ( [ eq : xnorm ] ) are : @xmath72 while the cms result includes the sm value ( @xmath73 ) in its favored region , the atlas and our combined results disfavor the sm ( at 68% c.l . ) .",
    "susy can provide the necessary corrections to bring the predicted theoretical value of @xmath69 inside the atlas favored band .    for the theoretical numerical analysis",
    ", we consider different susy scenarios , by checking that those scenarios are compatible with the present experimental value of the higgs boson mass , @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "the higgs boson mass is computed by using feynhiggs 2.11  @xcite . for completeness",
    ", first we consider the four scenarios analyzed in  @xcite and we find that the susy spectra defined in these scenarios provide a higgs boson mass value not compatible with the present experimental result .",
    "the only exception is the scenario with @xmath75 @xmath76 , in which we obtain that @xmath77 is around @xmath78 . for the purpose of making contact with the previous results",
    ", we include this scenario in the following discussion .",
    "besides , we choose susy spectra as defined in  @xcite for the @xmath79 , @xmath80 , light - stop , and light - stau scenarios in the mssm , which are compatible with the higgs boson mass of the observed signal at the lhc , and the benchmark scenario 2392587 of the phenomenological mssm ( pmssm )  @xcite , a general version of the r - parity conserving mssm with 20 input parameters .",
    "the sm parameters are fixed to be : @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "the cp - even mixing angle is computed including the leading corrections up to two - loop order by means of the program feynhiggsfast  @xcite .",
    "the branching ratios of higgs boson decays into @xmath84 and @xmath85 have been also computed with feynhiggs 2.11 and we find a perfect agreement with our results for values of @xmath86 50 .",

    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we turn now our attention to the heavy neutral higgs bosons @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in case of these heavy states",
    "are found at the lhc , one still has to answer the question whether they belong to a simple 2hdm , or whether they belong to a susy extension of the sm .",
    "the ratio of branching ratios @xmath0  ( [ eq : rdef ] ) can be useful in this task .",
    "[ rha - tanb ] shows the normalized ratio @xmath88  ( [ eq : xnorm ] ) as a function of @xmath30 for the @xmath79 , light - stop , light - stau , and pmssm scenarios with @xmath89 .",
    "note that once we are close to the decoupling limit ( @xmath90 ) the couplings of @xmath91 are indistinguishable , and , furthermore , the ratio @xmath92 becomes independent of @xmath93 .",
    "we show through different shaded regions the expected accuracies for the future measurement of @xmath0  ( [ eq : rdef ] ) , @xmath1332% ( shaded gray area ) , @xmath1312% ( shaded green area ) , and @xmath134% ( shaded orange area ) . for the sake of readiness",
    ", we only show the smallest accuracies reported in table  [ accuracy ] .",
    "we see that , given a large enough value of @xmath30 , all the scenarios ( except the @xmath80 ) provide a value for @xmath88  ( [ eq : xnorm ] ) larger than the expected experimental accuracies . within the @xmath79 scenario ,",
    "it would be possible to observe at the lhc 32% deviations with respect to the sm value for @xmath94 . at the hl - lhc , we could be sensitive to susy within this scenario for a 12% deviation from values of @xmath95 20 .",
    "the results for the light - stop , light - stau , and pmssm scenarios are very similar and even more favorable in order to detect any susy deviation with respect to the sm value .",
    "the lhc could observe @xmath96 deviations for values of @xmath3 larger than 20 and the hl - lhc would be sensitive to susy with @xmath97 deviations for @xmath95 5 .",
    "if an accuracy of @xmath98 is achieved at a future lc , it would be possible to probe the susy nature of @xmath15 and @xmath16 higgs bosons for @xmath95 5 in any of these four scenarios .",
    "therefore , if a new heavy higgs scalar or pseudoscalar is discovered , and its couplings to bottom quarks and @xmath36 leptons are measured with a moderate level of precision , it would be possible to distinguish between susy and non - susy higgs sectors at the lhc .",
    "in this work , we have updated the analysis of the observable @xmath99  ( [ eq : rdef ] ) in order to look for a strong evidence for , or against , the susy nature of the higgs boson .",
    "we have considered more realistic mssm scenarios with a lightest higgs boson mass @xmath77 compatible with the current value of the higgs boson mass @xmath100 125 gev .",
    "we have compared the theoretical prediction in the mssm with the current experimental determination of higgs boson couplings to fermions at the lhc  ( [ eq : lambdasexps ] ) .",
    "we find that the sm prediction for @xmath0 agrees well with current cms data , but using atlas data we obtain a ( one - standard deviation ) upper limit below the sm prediction .",
    "by contrast , the susy contributions can provide a prediction that agrees with the experiment at the one - standard deviation level .",
    "current accuracy already allows to exclude portions of the parameter space , showing the potential of the observable @xmath0 to discriminate among different models of new physics .",
    "it is also important to mention that the parameter space regions that are favored by the determination of the higgs boson couplings to fermions are in tension with the direct searches for mssm neutral higgs boson decaying into @xmath36-lepton pairs .",
    "we have also looked at the prospects for future measurements of the higgs boson couplings .",
    "we find that , in wide regions of the parameter space , a moderate accuracy of the couplings would signal the presence of susy in the higgs boson data .",
    "this analysis allows the use of relative couplings , which can improve significantly the accuracy in the experimental determination of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we have moved our attention to the heavier higgs bosons of the mssm , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "if one or both of these heavy neutral higgs bosons are discovered , one would still need to determine whether they belong to a generic 2hdm or to a susy model .",
    "a moderate accuracy determination of their couplings to @xmath37 quarks and @xmath36 leptons , by means of the analysis of the ratio @xmath0 , would be sufficient to discern the susy nature of such particles .",
