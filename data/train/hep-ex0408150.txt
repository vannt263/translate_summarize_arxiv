    "what is today called quark mixing was first introduced in 1963 by cabibbo @xcite as an angle characterizing the relative strength of strangeness changing and strangeness conserving weak amplitudes . in modern language",
    "we write the quark weak current as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are the charge 2/3 , 1/3 quark vectors and @xmath3 is a unitary matrix @xcite , often called the ckm matrix . whether @xmath3 is unitary",
    "can be checked experimentally .    for no good reason at all it became fashionable , in the mid - late nineties , to expect the ckm - matrix not to be unitary , providing great impetus to the study of @xmath4 mesons .",
    "the beautiful experiments at kek and slac have dashed such expectation , verifying unitarity to @xmath5 . by far the best check",
    "comes however from kaon physics .",
    "the so - called first row unitarity requires @xmath6 which , because @xmath7 @xcite , is equivalent to @xmath8 .",
    "semileptonic kaon decays offer possibly the cleanest way to obtain an accurate value of the cabibbo angle or better @xmath9 .",
    "since @xmath10 is a 0 - 0- transition , only the vector part of the weak current has a non vanishing contribution .",
    "such processes are protected by the ademollo - gatto theorem against su(3 ) breaking corrections to lowest order in @xmath11 .",
    "recent advances in lattice gauge techniques have allowed the computing of the pseudoscalar decay constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 . as a consequence",
    ", the @xmath14 partial decay rate provides a new handle for the determination of @xmath9 .",
    "for several years the particle data group ( pdg ) has reported values of @xmath15 and @xmath9 in slight disagreement with unitarity .",
    "the 2004 version @xcite , gives @xmath9=0.22000.0026 and @xmath15=0.97380.0005 from which the sum of the squares is 0.99660.0015 which verifies unitarity to @xmath16 albeit with a deviation of 2 .",
    "this result is however based on the so called pdg fit .",
    "examining inputs used for the fit and the output of the fit , one notices a few peculiarities :    1 .   direct measurements of the partial rates and/or branching ratios for",
    "the relevant decays , @xmath17 , are quite old , with accuracies of @xmath18 2 .   by using ratios of partial rates ,",
    "even far removed from the quantities of interest , the fit comes out with errors as low as 0.7% , this being the case for @xmath19 3 .",
    "radiative contribution to the input values are essentially unknown .",
    "this invalidates the constraints used in the fit as well as the usefulness of the resulting br values for obtaining @xmath9 4 .",
    "there are large differences in the form factor slopes for neutral and charged kaons .",
    "the ratio @xmath20 which is a unique function of the form factor slope parameters is quite inconsistent between charge and neutral kaons .",
    "the most recent results , from kek @xcite and istra+ @xcite , clearly indicate a smaller ratio .",
    "the charged kaon lifetime , given by pdg with an accuracy of 0.2% is in fact an average or fit of values covering an interval of 1.5% .",
    "while pdg might wish to be democratic , some of those values must be wrong .",
    "both central values and errors given by pdg for branching ratios are therefore suspect and anyway not usable , because of ignorance about inclusion of radiation , to obtain @xmath9 to better than several per cent .",
    "in principle the connection between partial decay rates and @xmath9 is as simple as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 contains well known things like the fermi constants , some @xmath23 s and two s , clebsches etc .",
    "there is a phase space integral and some corrections @xmath24 .",
    "we begin with things that follow from measurement .",
    "partial width are always obtained from @xmath25 ,   we must measure both branching fractions and lifetimes . the phase space integral is a function of masses , quite well known and of the shape of the form factor .",
    "the @xmath26 form factor is defined by : @xmath27 where @xmath28 or some other parameterization , with @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 are the initial and final four momenta , @xmath31 is the pion mass and @xmath32 is the vector part of the quark current .",
    "the form factor parameters can and must be measured for the vector form factor @xmath26 and also for the scalar form factor @xmath33 . in the following",
    "we retain the three parameters : @xmath34 defined above and the analogous parameter @xmath35    amongst the corrections , radiative effects are quite important .",
    "since we can not turn off electromagnetism , we must include in the measurement some well defined fraction of the radiative decays .",
    "ideally we want to measure the rate or br for decays to @xmath36 _ etc_. , plus any number of s .",
    "this rate is finite and calculable .",
    "a very important point , being only recently fully recognized , is that radiative effects must be included in the acceptance calculations , in practice in the decay generators used for the monte carlo simulations . otherwise counting mistakes of several per cent are inevitable",
    ".    there is more to the corrections .",
    "there are radiative corrections , both short distance and low energy corrections to the phase space density both with and without external radiation .",
    "there are isospin breaking correction to account for -@xmath37 and @xmath38-@xmath39 ( or @xmath40-@xmath41 ) differences .",
    "finally pions and kaons are not quite the same objects and @xmath42 breaking ( or @xmath43-@xmath41 difference induced ) corrections must be included .",
    "this last corrections is the factor @xmath44 , mentioned above in the definition of the form factor .",
    "we can note that there is a unique value @xmath45 for both @xmath26 and @xmath33 in neutral kaon decays and another for charged kaons .",
    "one ends up with something like : . ]",
    "@xmath46 \\label{gamma1}\\ ] ] @xmath47 is the integral of the phase space density , factoring out @xmath48 and without radiative corrections . short distance radiative corrections are in the sirlin term @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "in addition long distance radiative corrections @xcite for form factor , phase space density and @xmath50 breaking are included as @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the first evidence that not all was correct with the pdg information came from e865 at bnl , who published in 2003 a fully inclusive value for @xmath53 decays @xcite of br(@xmath54)=(5.130.10)% , to be compared to ( 4.870.06)% .",
    "the difference is not very large and moreover e865 actually measures the ratio @xmath55 and relies on pdg for knowledge of the denominator .",
    "early in 2004 kloe @xcite reported on @xmath56 , finding @xmath57=(7.920.12),6 , s , to be compared to ( 7.500.08),6 , s for .",
    "this result does not rely in any way on external information but uses the new , precise kloe result for @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath59 results implies @xmath9=0.22720.0029 while from kloe @xmath9=0.22540.0026 , both values in very good agreement with unitarity which requires a value of 0.22650.0022 .",
    "past experience proves the dangers of using too many intermediate steps and information from different experiments .",
    "the best way to obtain partial rate measurements is to start with a tagged kaon sample and count decays to the appropriate channels .",
    "accurate lifetimes are still lacking , especially for -mesons but also possibly for charged kaons . finally , to extract @xmath9 the form factor parameters",
    "must be measured , values calculated in chiral perturbation not being reliable .    an alternate way consists of measuring all major ratios @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the partial width for channel @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the partial width for a major channel , not included in the previous set",
    ". then the constraint @xmath64 allows solving for all branching ratios @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for the  case , choosing the 4 channels @xmath36 , @xmath67 ,  and  we have 0.0035@xmath680.0036  one can reach in principle an accuracy of 0.0001 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 or 0.03% .    the first method is ideally employed at a  where the production of the  pair in -decay provides a tagged , monochromatic -beam of known flux",
    "this is the choice of kloe @xcite which has obtained preliminary results discussed below .",
    "an advantage of working with a tagged monochromatic  beam is that of performing also lifetime measurements .",
    "the latter can be done by observing the time dependence of decays to a particular channel .",
    "even better , the lifetime can be obtained by just counting all decays in a time , or space , interval .",
    "final results on  decays have been given by the ktev collaboration @xcite . in their very complete study of semileptonic",
    "decays , ktev gives very accurate branching ratios and new precise values for the form factor parameters .",
    "the @xmath69 branching fraction is found to be 0.40670.0011 , strikingly different from the pdg fit value of 0.38780.0027 .",
    "they have also clearly established the necessity of a curvature term in the vector form factor , quantitatively @xmath71 .",
    "the linear term is however smaller , @xmath72 .",
    "this results in a 1% reduction of the phase space integral corresponding to an increase of 0.5% for @xmath9 .",
    "this reinforces the warning that comparison of results obtained with different parameter values are meaningless .",
    "another advantage of the monochromatic tagged  beam is the unambiguous closure of the kinematics .",
    "this however is not quite so important for just counting the number of different decay modes .",
    "there are two main cases to distinguish : 1 ) all neutral particles :  is 99.8% of the total ; 2 ) two charged particles final state , dominated by @xmath19 , @xmath73 and .",
    "the three contribution are quite well distinguished by the variable @xmath74 , computed using the muon and the pion masses for the charged particles and choosing the lowest value .",
    "1 illustrates the channel separation as well as the agreement with monte carlo simulation which fully accounts for radiation in all channels .",

    "it is interesting to note that this last @xmath9 value is low while the one obtained from @xmath93 is high .",
    "it is quite possible that the same cause is responsible for both effects .",

    "it is quite conceivable that in one or two years uncertainties due to lifetime , form factor shape parameters and the branching ratios will be brought to the 0.1% level .",
    "we can only hope that a similar improvement will come about for @xmath44 .",
