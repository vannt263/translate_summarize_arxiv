    "one of the main approaches of modeling limit order books is the zero intelligence approach ( see @xcite ) , which assumes all quantities of interest in the limit order book are governed by stochastic processes .",
    "of the zero - intelligence models developed so far , the approach of @xcite is an attractive starting point for modeling limit order flow in continuous time due to the tractability of the model and it s reduced dimensionality .",
    "they calculate various quantities of interest such as the probability of a price increase or the diffusion limit of the price process .",
    "+ having found evidence in empirical observations , the authors of @xcite extended the framework of @xcite .",
    "they incorporated an arbitrary distribution for the inter - arrival times of the book events as well as a dependency of both , the type of a book event and its corresponding inter - arrival times , on the type of the previous book event .",
    "therefore they used a markov renewal process to model the dynamics of the bid and ask queues , which are assumed to be independent of each other . after a price change they are reinitialized .",
    "the model remains analytically tractable . as in @xcite the bid / ask spread remains equal to one tick and all orders have the same size .",
    "we briefly recap the model used in @xcite highlighting the notations and definitions we will use in this paper . as the model from @xcite ,",
    "price changes are assumed to happen at each time @xmath0 at which the ask or the bid queue is depleted .",
    "the sojourn times are notated as @xmath1 .",
    "the changes in the queue sizes are modeled by a markov chain @xmath2 for the ask side and @xmath3 for the bid side .",
    "their state space is @xmath4 .",
    "when a limit order appears at time t , the queue size increases by one unit and @xmath5 , when a market order or cancellation appears , it decreases by one and @xmath6 .",
    "the notations for the bid side are defined accordingly .",
    "the paper defines a balanced and a unbalanced case .",
    "the classification is dependent on the transition probabilities of the markov chain modeling the queue sizes : @xmath7,\\text { } i , j\\in \\{-1,1\\}.\\ ] ] @xmath8 is defined accordingly .",
    "the balanced case is defined in the following way : @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the unbalanced case is on hand if @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "built on this model , @xcite proposes the following jump model for the stock price @xmath13 based on a counting process @xmath14 and a markov chain @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath14 counts how often the price changes and @xmath15 keeps track of which direction the price changed at each time of @xmath0 , meaning @xmath17 . a price change is assumed to happen at every time the bid or the ask queue of the limit order book is depleted .",
    "we note that results of @xcite were fist announced at ipam fmwsi , ucla , march 23 - 27 , 2015 ( see @xcite ) . also available at srrn ( see @xcite ) and arxiv ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the paper was submitted to siam journal of financial mathematics in april 2015 and an extended version was resubmitted in march 2016 .      as in @xcite , @xcite",
    "assume that all price changes occurring in the price process are of magnitude @xmath18 , a single tick .",
    "table [ price_changesmid ] demonstrates the average price change for each stock in our data set . for apple midprice data we observe 53,654 price changes , from which only 9007 are of magnitude @xmath18",
    ". meaning , 83.21% ( 44,647 ) of the price changes were different from one tick .",
    ".mid - price changes in ticks [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     given that our model focuses explicitly on the midprice , which does not include information about the observed spread , we assume @xmath19 for our model even though it is difficult to justify empirically using our data sets . as demonstrated , the diffusion limit calculated using the midprice is still a valid approximation for long run volatility of the midprice .",
    "after reviewing some of the assumptions from @xcite and @xcite for our sets of data , we showed how to develop the model presented in @xcite ( see sec . 6 : discussion ) .",
    "in section [ twostates ] , we illustrated a model that considers two possible price changes different from one tick , as well as our numerical results . in section [ severalstates ]",
    ", we further generalized the model by now considering an arbitrary number of possible price changes .",
    "as proposed in @xcite , we compared the diffusion coefficients to the standard deviation of the ten minute price changes . applying a linear regression using our available data , we tested how good our model extensions describe the linear relationship .",
    "we showed a large improvement in the adjusted r^2^ with the first extension , where we allowed sizes of price jumps to have a magnitude different to one tick .",
    "the second model extension included a higher number of possible sizes of price changes .",
    "the adjusted r^2^ increased again .",
    "future work could take a closer look at the model behaviour in times of crisis",
    ". it would be interesting to see if the distribution of inter - arrival times of book events changes and if a diffusion limit still exists .",
    "if evidence is found that regime switching has a big influence on the model , it would be the next step to include another markov chain into the model containing the information in what kind of regime the market is .",
    "this extended model could be of use for practical algorithms trying to detect a switching point in price changes and make profit of that knowledge .",
    "it could also be used to detect insider trading .",
