    "for more than 35 years it has been known extra - galactic proton cosmic rays should not exceed the energy of about @xmath2 ev .",
    "this is the gzk bound @xcite .",
    "year after year , observations have continued to defy this result @xcite .",
    "recent observations of showers with reliably determined energies above @xmath3 ev @xcite deepen the puzzle .",
    "the gzk bound is as basic as the big bang and the standard model .",
    "the bound is obtained by attenuation of ultra - high energy ( uhe ) protons on the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the threshold of @xmath2 ev is kinematic , representing a center of mass energy sufficient for production of electron - positron pairs and nuclear resonances .",
    "the cross sections for these reactions and the density of microwave background photons are known .",
    "so the attenuation of protons is known , and exponential attenuation will eliminate protons from sources more about 50 mpc from the earth .",
    "there are not enough sources within 50 mpc to explain the data , making the origin of the @xmath4-violating events very mystifying .",
    "speculative models such as unstable superheavy relic particles and topological defects can create particles of high enough energy , but also require sources within the same limited sphere .",
    "a hint of correlations between observed event directions and cosmologically - distant sources @xcite , if confirmed , also indicates something very mysterious .",
    "the only elementary particle that could cross the requisite intergalactic distances of about 100 mpc or more is the neutrino .",
    "the only electrically neutral , stable particle that could expain correlations with cosmologically - distant sources is also the neutrino .",
    "flux estimates of @xmath5 neutrinos produced by extra - galactic sources and gzk - attenuated nucleons and nuclei vary widely , but suffice to account for the shower rates observed .",
    "the neutrino would be a natural candidate for the events , if its interaction cross section were large enough @xcite .",
    "the neutrino - nucleon total cross section @xmath6 is the crucial issue . in the standard model @xmath6",
    "is based on small - x qcd evolution and @xmath7 exchange physics .",
    "cross sections of order @xmath8 mb are predicted for the region of @xmath9 ev primary energy .",
    "this is far too small to explain the data : so perhaps new physical processes may be at work .",
    "total cross sections at high energies are dominated by characteristics of the t - channel exchanges .",
    "the growth of @xmath6 with energy , in turn , is directly correlated with the _ spin _ of exchanged particles .",
    "for this reason the gzk - puzzle can not be explained by considering new spin-1 exchanges .",
    "new w- or z - like massive _ vector _ bosons would produce @xmath6 growing at the same rate as the standard one , and normalized below it .",
    "indeed any new neutrino physics must not disturb the agreement of laboratory data with 4-fermi physics in the low energy region . at the same time the @xmath4-violating data indicates a cross section growing with energy that must greatly exceed the standard model growth by @xmath9 ev .",
    "how is this possible ?",
    "the paradox is beautifully resolved with _",
    "massive spin-2 _ exchange",
    ". the fascinating possibility of massive spin-2 exchange has recently become popular in the context of hidden  extra \" dimensions@xcite .",
    "kaluza - klein ( @xmath11 ) excitations of the graviton are believed to act like a tower of massive spin-2 particle exchanges .",
    "we calculate the effect using the feynman rules developed by several groups@xcite .",
    "we find neutrino - nucleon cross section values at @xmath12 ev in the @xmath13 mb range from mass scales in the @xmath14 tev range .",
    "interestingly , this range of masses is just that indicated by the extra - dimensions phenomenology , and this range of cross sections is just that indicated by the @xmath4-violating data .",
    "what about low energies ? with spin-2 exchange",
    ", @xmath15 grows like @xmath16 and @xmath17 like @xmath18 in the low - energy , perturbative region ( with a cutoff on t , then one power of s in the total cross section is replaced by the cutoff , of course ) .",
    "the new contributions to @xmath6 are naturally orders of magnitude below the standard model component in the entire regime where neutrino cross sections have been measured . nor is any miracle needed for the neutrino interactions to emerge above ordinary cosmic ray events above @xmath19 ev .",
    "that is because the @xmath4 attenuation process must set in , uncovering a spectrum of neutrinos just at the point where protons get attenuated away .",
    "our model of neutrinos and massive spin-2 exchange explain the @xmath4-violating events consistent with all known experimental limits , as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "striking signatures appear in predictions of signals in planned @xmath20-scale cosmic neutrino detectors .",
    "the 1 tev to 10 pev region will be explored , much like the existing amanda@xcite and rice@xcite detectors . in this regime",
    "the predicted @xcite ratio of upward to downward neutrino - induced showers differs substantially from the standard model , creating a nice diagnostic for new physics .",
    "horizontal air showers develop over long distances and probe smaller cross sections .",
    "using essentially our enhanced cross section with @xmath21 behaviour , but with different parameter choices , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite link horizontal shower studies to extra dimension physics .",
    "they show how fundamental scales up to 10 tev can be probed .",
    "detailed studies of shower characteristics generated by our model for various cross sections are also underway@xcite .",
    "we find that the neutrino - induced and proton - induced showers can not be distinguished on a shower - by - shower basis .",
    "there are exciting prospects for finding signals of new physics in shower angular distributions .",
    "a recent re - calculation within the same kaluza - klein @xmath11 framework @xcite includes the `` brane recoil '' effects advocated by@xcite . after making several technical points , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite present a cross section that is basically equivalent to our @xmath16 growth model .",
    "they conclude that the resulting cross section is too small to explain the uhe cosmic ray showers",
    ". however they do not consider all the parameter choices allowed by current experimental limits and hence we find their conclusions unsupported .",
