    "it is important to emphasize that , while the estimates of the weak lec contributions to @xmath0 are model - dependent , the one - loop and strong lec contributions ( discussed below ) are , though scale - dependent , model - independent . as we will see , the combination of these model - independent nlo contributions is , at typical hadronic scales , rather large , and negative , suggesting a significant reduction of @xmath0 as compared to the conventional value .",

    "we begin our discussion with the non - wlec contributions .",
    "these are model - independent and unambiguous , albeit renormalisation - scale - dependent , since the nlo contributions concerned all involve exactly one weak @xmath158 vertex .",

    "the results are presented at two different renormalisation scales , @xmath164 and @xmath108 , in order to display explicitly the scale dependence of the non - wlec contributions .",
    "when using the wdm estimate for the nlo weak lec s , we employ @xmath108 ( consistent with the expectations of resonance saturation ) , and when using the @xmath97qm estimates , @xmath165 gev ( the matching scale employed in ref .",
    "@xcite in obtaining fits for the @xmath97qm parameters ) .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the non - wlec contributions to @xmath155 and @xmath154 both act to reduce @xmath0 as compared to its lo value .",
    "the @xmath154 non - wlec contribution is weakly scale dependent and , being `` universal '' , follows immediately from the corresponding cp - even results of ref .",
    "although for scales @xmath166 @xmath167 is positive , and hence acts to lower @xmath0 , the scale dependence , in this case , is significantly stronger .",
    "the increase in the magnitude of @xmath98 associated with the loop contributions is what one would expect given the attractive final state interactions ( fsi ) in the @xmath168 channel , and is analogous to the @xmath21 fsi enhancement discussed previously for the cp - even case  @xcite .",
    "the effect of fsi on the cp - odd amplitudes has also been recently discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite it is argued that the value of @xmath98 obtained from approaches which do not generate the final state @xmath19 @xmath169 phases for the @xmath169 @xmath6 amplitudes should be enhanced by fsi by a factor of @xmath170 , while the value of @xmath171 should be suppressed by the weakly repulsive @xmath172 fsi by a factor of @xmath173 .",
    "the numerical values of the enhancement / suppression are obtained using the omnes representation for the amplitude , and correspond to the subtraction point @xmath174 , for which the chpt representation of the amplitude is presumed to be accurate .",
    "it should be borne in mind that the @xmath169 fsi , corresponding to fig .",
    "1(f ) , are already correctly included in our calculations , up to nlo in the chiral expansion .",
    "that the @xmath168 fsi , for example , produce a significant enhancement of @xmath98 , follows from the known fsi enhancement of @xmath21 in the cp - even case  @xcite and the `` universality '' of the one - loop contributions .",
    "one should also note that the omnes function part of the representation of the amplitudes does not incorporate all of the nlo effects ; some nlo effects remain in the polynomial prefactor .",
    "thus the question of interest to us , namely whether the _ complete _ set of nlo contributions raises or lowers @xmath98 _ relative to its lo value _",
    "( i.e. , whether @xmath155 is positive or negative ) is not determined solely by the character of the loop contributions ; it is perfectly possible , in principle , for the nlo lec contributions to be sufficiently negative that the full nlo determination of @xmath155 is negative , even in the presence of the attractive fsi phases .",
    "for the models we have considered , this is not the case , and the combination of non - wlec and wlec contributions to @xmath155 is positive , leading to a suppression of @xmath0 below its lo value .",
    "it is important to note that , so long as one adheres to the convention of incorporating the effect of the @xmath172 leakage contribution by means of a multiplicative correction factor applied to the contribution to the @xmath168 amplitude , there is an amplification effect at work in the gluonic penguin contribution to @xmath13 associated with the nlo contributions to @xmath98 : the more nlo effects _ increase _ the isospin - conserving contribution to @xmath98 , the more they simultaneously _ decrease _ @xmath0 .",
    "since the contribution to @xmath13 , including ib , is proportional to the product of the isospin - conserving contribution and the factor @xmath14 , both effects serve to enhance the @xmath9 contribution to @xmath13 .",
    "the nlo weak lec contributions to @xmath155 and @xmath154 are estimated using the models described in the previous section .",
    "the numerical results are displayed in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "we note first that the contributions to @xmath175 and @xmath176 in the wdm are identical , and hence cancel in the difference , @xmath177 , entering eq .",
    "[ omegaibnlo ] . in the @xmath97qm ,",
    "the wlec contributions to @xmath0 are positive .",
    "indeed the results of tables  [ table2 ] and [ table3 ] show significant cancellation between the wlec and non - wlec contributions in the @xmath97qm .    the total nlo correction factor , @xmath178 which multiplies @xmath179 , resulting from the combination of wlec and non - wlec contributions , is @xmath180 taking the @xmath97qm result as a central value , and the deviation of the wdm result from this central value as a minimal measure of the model - dependence of our result , we find the ib correction to the gluonic penguin contribution to @xmath5 to be @xmath181 where the first error represents the uncertainty associated with the model dependence of the nlo weak lec s , and the second the uncertainty in the input value of @xmath182 .",
    "the central value in eq .  [ omegaibmean ] is significantly lower than both the conventionally - employed value , @xmath183 , and the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath184 . that the relative uncertainty increases from about 30% to 62% is a reflection of the uncertain state of our knowledge of the nlo weak lec s .",
    "we emphasize , however , that , regardless of the actual value of the weak nlo lec contributions , the model - independent one - loop and strong lec contributions , which are unambiguous , produce a significant reduction of @xmath0 for any plausible choice of hadronic scale . as such , the inclusion of the loop contributions is crucial to any attempt to evaluate @xmath0 beyond lo .",
    "for the models considered for the weak nlo lec s , the net effect is to drive @xmath0 significantly below its lo value .",
    "as noted above , the significant cancellation between gluonic penguin and electroweak penguin contributions means that predictions for the value of @xmath13 in the standard model can depend rather sensitively on @xmath0 .",
    "the exact degree of sensitivity , of course , depends on the relative size of these two dominant contributions , on which there is , as of yet , no clear theoretical concensus . in order to illustrate the impact of the decrease of @xmath0 from the conventional central value , @xmath185 , to @xmath186 ,",
    "let us use the rough approximation to eq .",

    "@xcite , from which the values for @xmath13 corresponding to @xmath193 have also been taken .",
    "all results correspond to central values of the input parameters @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "> from the table we see that the decrease in @xmath0 corresponds to an increase in @xmath13 of between @xmath198 and @xmath199 ( @xmath200 for the central @xmath201 values ) .",
    "the increase in the magnitude of @xmath13 is between @xmath202 and @xmath203 , to be compared to the current experimental world average @xmath204 .",
    "the magnitude of the increase will , of course , be even larger for models with larger values of @xmath191 .",
    "it is useful to comment in more detail on the application of the corrections discussed above to microscopic models such as the @xmath97qm and the extended njl model  @xcite .",
    "such models allow one , in principle , to compute the corrections corresponding to the nlo weak lec s self - consistently within the model , as was , for example , done by the trieste group  @xcite for @xmath98 . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite ( in the context of the @xmath97qm ) , however , modifying the model predictions for @xmath13 obtained using the conventional value of @xmath0 is more complicated than simply re - scaling the gluonic penguin contribution to take into account the new value of the factor @xmath14 .",
    "the reason is that the conventional value of @xmath0 ( assumed to be the same for the cp - even and cp - odd cases ) enters also the determination of the cp - even amplitude @xmath22 in the model ; a change in @xmath0 in the cp - even sector would thus necessitate a re - fitting of the parameters of the model .",
    "in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was noted that the re - fitting of parameters necessitated by a shift in @xmath0 would almost entirely compensate for the effect of the shifted value of @xmath0 in the model determination of @xmath13 .",
    "one should , however , bear in mind the caveat that this observation is based on the implicit assumption that @xmath0 is the same in the cp - even and cp - odd sectors .",
    "although this is true for the non - wlec contributions , there is no reason to expect it to be true for the nlo weak lec contributions .",
    "in fact , since these contributions correspond to the hadronization of very different effective operators , it would be rather surprising to find them taking on the same values .",
    "fortunately one does not need to speculate idly on this question : in models such as the @xmath97qm it is possible to simply compute the nlo terms corresponding to the weak nlo lec contributions .",
    "having fitted the model parameters in the cp - even sector , one would then obtain , self - consistently , a determination of @xmath205_{wlec}$ ] for both the cp - even and cp - odd cases . in order to make sure the determination of the strong ib correction to @xmath13 is under control , it is important to separately determine the nlo weak lec contributions to the leakage amplitudes in the cp - even and cp - odd sectors .    to summarize ,",
    "we have presented a complete nlo calculation of the isospin - breaking correction to the gluonic penguin operator contribution to @xmath5 , @xmath0 .",
    "it is found that model - independent nlo one - loop and strong lec contributions are of the opposite sign to the lo contribution , and numerically large , for typical hadronic scales .",
    "combined with model estimates for the nlo weak lec contributions , we find a significant reduction of @xmath0 as compared to the ` standard ' value of @xmath3 .",
    "our final result is @xmath206 ( where the uncertainties associated with model - dependence and @xmath182 have been added in quadrature ) .",
