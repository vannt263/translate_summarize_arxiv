    "multi - target sensor control / management is essentially an optimal non - linear control problem .",
    "the goal of multi - target sensor management is to direct the right sensor on the right platform to the right target at the right time  @xcite .",
    "however , the multi - target sensor control problem differs from the classical control problem in that it deals with highly complex multi - object stochastic systems . in multi - object stochastic systems , not only",
    "do the number of objects vary randomly in time , but the measurements are subject to missed detections and false alarms .",
    "this means that the multi - target state and multi - target observation are inherently finite - set - valued .",
    "consequently , standard optimal control techniques are not directly applicable @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the multi - target sensor scheduling problem can still be cast in the framework of partially observed markov decision processes ( pomdps ) , where the states and observations are instead finite - set - valued , and control vectors are drawn from a set of admissible sensor actions based on the current information states , which are then judged against the values of an objective function associated with each action @xcite .",
    "a unified approach to characterizing systems with finite - set - valued states is the multi - object systems framework , where uncertainty is described by multi - object probability density functions , and formalized via point process theory @xcite , or equivalently by random finite set ( rfs ) theory through mahler s finite set statistics ( fisst ) @xcite .",
    "the key advantage of the rfs based approach is that of a principled framework for modelling , estimation and control of multi - object systems . in this paper",
    ", we formulate the sensor control problem as a pomdp with an information - theoretic objective function as well as finite - set - valued states and measurements .",
    "in essence , our approach can be summarized by three basic steps :    1 .   modelling the sensor and targets as a multi - object stochastic system , i.e. the multi - target states and multi - target observations as rfss 2 .   propagating the multi - object posterior density recursively in time , or alternatively a tractable approximation to the posterior",
    "; 3 .   at each time , determining the control action based on optimization of the reward function over a set of admissible actions .    in the context of single - target tracking ,",
    "the work in @xcite is the first to propose a practical particle implementation based on the kullback - leibler divergence , and the approach in @xcite further considers the issue of observer trajectory planning . in the more difficult multi - target context",
    ", there are a handful of works falling within the rfs framework . using the rnyi divergence as the reward function , in rv10",
    "the particle multi - object bayes filter @xcite is used to propagate the multi - object posterior , while in @xcite the particle probability hypothesis density ( phd ) filter @xcite is used to propagate the first moment of the multi - object posterior .",
    "this paper adopts an information theoretic approach for multi - target sensor control , similar to the approach in @xcite , except that the cardinality balanced multi - target multi - bernoulli ( cb - member ) filter vvc09 is used to propagate a parametrized approximation to the multi - object posterior .",
    "the proposed approach is attractive in that it is applicable to general non - linear non - gaussian models , and when coupled with a particle implementation further reduces the computational load significantly . propagating an approximate multi - bernoulli posterior as proposed is drastically cheaper than propagating the full multi - object posterior as in @xcite , and thus the computation of any associated cost function using a multi - bernoulli approximation is generally cheaper than using the full posterior .",
    "while the proposed use of the cb - member filter incurs the same complexity as the use of the phd filter for the same purpose in @xcite , performing state estimation with the former is more efficient and reliable than the latter because the need for clustering is eliminated .",
    "the work in @xcite also demonstrates that the rnyi divergence can be used as a reward function for multi - target sensor control . in the same regard",
    ", the use of the cb - member filter equally allows the rnyi divergence to be used as a reward function , and further allows a new type of the reward function to be developed .",
    "since the variance of the estimated cardinality of a multi - bernoulli posterior can be evaluated in closed form @xcite , minimizing the cardinality variance can be used as the control objective , thereby enabling direct control of the cardinality estimation error .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is a computationally efficient sensor control algorithm for multiple targets , using the cb - member filter , as well as the numerical assessment of two types of control objectives . our preliminary result ,",
    "in particular the idea of using the cb - member filter , has been reported in the conference paper @xcite .",
    "the current paper provides full details of the algorithm , an alternative cheaper control objective , and more complete numerical studies .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review rfs modelling of multi - object systems and the approximation of the multi - object posterior density using the cb - member filter .",
    "the two reward functions are discussed in section 3 while sequential monte carlo ( smc ) implementation is described in section 4 .",
    "section 5 presents simulation results and finally , section 6 concludes the paper .",
    "in this section , we summarize the cb - member filter , the main tool that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "the filter was originally introduced in vvc09 to account for the cardinality bias of the member filter in mah07 .",
    "in contrast with single - object systems where the states and observations are modelled by random vectors , the states and observations of a multi - object system are random finite sets of vectors in the single - object state space @xmath0 and single - object observation space @xmath1 , respectively : @xmath2here @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the spaces of all finite subsets of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the system is described by the following probabilistic state space model : @xmath7where",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively are the state and observation of the system at time @xmath10 .",
    "equation describes the system dynamics encapsulating all aspects of object birth , death and transition while equation encapsulates all aspects of sensor detection and false alarms .",
    "given the system model - , the objective is to determine at each time step @xmath10 the multi - object posterior probability density @xmath11 . in the bayesian filtering framework , @xmath11 is obtained through two steps : time prediction and measurement update @xcite .",
    "the predicted density at time @xmath10 , denoted as @xmath12 , is computed by the multi - object chapman - kolmogorov equation : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the posterior density from the previous time step @xmath15 .",
    "when new observations arrive at the sensor(s ) , the new posterior density is computed via the multi - object bayes rule : @xmath16notice that the integrals in and are not ordinary integrals , but are set integrals , and  that the recursion and has no analytic solution in general .",
    "a sequential monte carlo ( smc ) implementation of the bayes multi - object filter is given in @xcite .",
    "however , this technique is computationally prohibitive which at best is able to accommodate a small number of targets .",
    "the multi - target sensor scheduling algorithm proposed in @xcite employs this smc implementation of the multi - object bayes filter .    since propagation of the full posterior density given by is in general intractable , several alternatives",
    "have been proposed , which propagate only summary statistics or important parameters in place of the full posterior density .",
    "for example , the phd and cardinalized phd ( cphd ) filters @xcite propagate the intensity or first order moment of the posterior density , and were employed by the multi - target sensor scheduling approach in @xcite .",
    "an alternative is the cb - member filter @xcite , which propagates a parametrized multi - bernoulli approximation of the multi - object posterior density .",
    "the main advantage of the cb - member approach is its direct applicability to non - linear non - gaussian models , which when coupled with an smc implementation , obviates the need for the clustering of the particle population in order to extract estimates .",
    "we now summarize the recursion for the cb - member filter .",
    "a bernoulli rfs @xmath17 has realizations either as the empty set or a singleton and is characterized jointly by a probability of existence @xmath18 $ ] and a probability density @xmath19 .",
    "that is , the bernoulli rfs takes on a singleton value with probability @xmath20 , and conditional upon existence , the value of the singleton is distributed according to the probability density @xmath19 .",
    "a multi - bernoulli rfs is a union of a fixed number @xmath21 of independent bernoulli rfss @xmath22 with existence probability @xmath23 $ ] and probability density @xmath24 .",
    "a multi - bernoulli rfs is completely characterized by the parameter pairs @xmath25 and consequently its probability density can be abbreviated by @xmath26 .",
    "notice that the realizations of a multi - bernoulli rfs are finite sets including the empty set whose cardinality can not exceed @xmath27 . as the explicit expression for the probability density of a multi - bernoulli rfs",
    "is not needed for this paper , the reader is referred to the original references mah07,vvc09 for these details .",
    "the premise of the cb - member filter is that the multi - object posterior density can be approximated by that of a multi - bernoulli rfs .",
    "consequently the cb - member filter recursively propagates only the parameter set @xmath28 instead of the full multi - object posterior .",
    "specifically , if the posterior multi - object density at time @xmath15 can be approximated by a multi - bernoulli rfs of the form @xmath29 then the predicted multi - object density to time @xmath10 is also that of a multi - bernoulli rfs and is given by @xmath30where @xmath31 are the parameters of the multi - bernoulli rfs of births at time @xmath10 , and @xmath32here @xmath33 denotes the probability of object survival given previous state @xmath34 ; @xmath35 denotes the single - object transition density given previous state @xmath34 ; and @xmath36 is the standard notation for the inner product between two continuous functions .    for brevity ,",
    "denote the predicted multi - bernoulli density specified in by @xmath37 .",
    "then , the posterior multi - object density at time @xmath10 can be approximated by that of a multi - bernoulli rfs with unbiased cardinality as follows @xmath38where @xmath39here @xmath9 is the measurement set at time @xmath10 , @xmath40 is the single - object likelihood given the current state @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the probability of object detection at the current state @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the intensity of poisson clutter at time @xmath10 .",
    "the objective function plays a crucial role in sensor control problems as it determines the manoeuvre of the sensor .",
    "suppose at time @xmath10 that a control vector @xmath45 is applied to the sensor , where @xmath46 is the set of admissible control vectors .",
    "denote by @xmath47 the objective function if we were to apply the control vector @xmath48 and subsequently were to observe the measurement sequence @xmath49 .",
    "notice that the reward function depends on @xmath50 future measurements which could be taken to @xmath51 . in this paper",
    "however , we only consider a single step ahead ( myopic ) policy . an established approach to mitigate",
    "the presence of unknown future measurements in the reward function is to take the expectation of @xmath52 over all possible values of the future measurement @xmath53 , i.e. the control vector @xmath54 is chosen so that @xmath55 $ ] is optimal @xcite .    in this paper , we present two different types of objective functions .",
    "the first approach employs the rnyi divergence between the predicted and updated densities , while the second uses the variance of the maximum a posteriori ( map ) cardinality estimate or cardinality variance for short .",
    "the rnyi divergence , or alpha divergence , is commonly used as an objective function in information - theoretic sensor control @xcite and encompasses other information measures such as the kullback - leibler divergence or hellinger affinity as special cases . specifically , the rnyi divergence between the predicted and updated densities is defined as follows @xcite @xmath56^\\alpha\\\\ [ f_{k+1|k}(\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}|\\mathbf{z}_{1:k})\\big]^{1-\\alpha}\\delta\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is an adjustable parameter .",

    "an increase in the value of the rnyi divergence can be roughly interpreted as an indication that more information should be obtained from the future measurements .",
    "thus , the control vector @xmath54 at time @xmath10 can be chosen to maximize the expectation of the rnyi divergence over all possible measurements at time @xmath61 : @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "the elegance of a rnyi divergence based control strategy however carries several drawbacks .",
    "first , it has no analytic solution in general and thus its computation is potentially expensive .",
    "second , the rnyi divergence is a measure of information gain , but in some abstract mathematical sense , and it is unclear if or how it translates directly into practical performance criteria such as cardinality and/or localization errors .      in this section , we propose minimizing the estimated cardinality variance as an alternative objective function , which directly translates to the minimization of the estimated cardinality error .",
    "when the cb - member filter is used to propagate the posterior density , the objective function can be computed analytically , which enables a principled and efficient solution platform for multi - object sensor control .",

    ", this control strategy is expected to perform well if the sensor gives reasonable information on the actual state variables of the targets . however ,",
    "if the sensor does not provide sufficient information on the state variables , for example bearing or range only sensors , the performance degrades in pathological cases as we will illustrate with an example later .",

    "[ fig1 ] illustrates the typical resultant sensor trajectories for the two proposed control strategies .",
    "it can be seen that both control policies result in sensor behaviours that would be expected of a `` good '' control policy as hypothesized above . minimizing the cardinality variance appears to result in smoother changes in the sensor trajectory",
    "while maximizing rnyi divergence appears to permit impulsive jumps in the sensor position .    however , the two control strategies appear to respond differently to target births and deaths .",
    "the rnyi divergence based control prefers for the sensor to stay close to confirmed targets , reacting immediately to a target death nearby , but only changing positions slightly when there is a target birth far away .",
    "this is because the rnyi divergence cost seeks the `` best '' overall information taken across all targets , which is small if the sensor were to move towards a single unconfirmed target located at a distance from the sensor , but much larger if the sensor were to stay in the vicinity of multiple targets which are already confirmed . moreover moving away from multiple confirmed targets and towards a possible unconfirmed target",
    "may even result in a decrease in the overall information .",
    "hence the sensor remains in the vicinity of existing targets . the cardinality variance based strategy on the other hand moves the sensor to middle of the estimated target positions regardless of births of deaths .",
    "this is because the cardinality variance based control does not take into target localization error , and thus seeks to optimize the cardinality estimate even if position estimates are poor .",
    "consequently the sensor is driven to maximize the detection probability and minimize the measurement noise across all targets which is generally achieved by positioning itself in the middle of suspected detections .     and",

    "the average run time for the rnyi divergence based strategies are 0.99 seconds ( cb - member ) , 2.46 seconds ( phd without clustering ) , and 2.51 seconds ( phd with @xmath10-means clustering ) while those for cardinality variance based strategies are 0.61 seconds ( non sampling ) and 41.35 seconds ( with sampling ) . as expected",
    ", the non sampling cb - member based strategy is the fastest .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the averaged optimal subpattern assignment ( ospa ) metric @xcite ( with parameters @xmath155 , @xmath156 ) over 200 monte carlo runs for different control strategies .",

    "[ fig2]a suggest that the performance of phd based strategies relies heavily on the partitioning of the particle population . while k - means clustering",
    "is highly unreliable , the measurement driven estimation @xcite is more consistent . furthermore , using the same rnyi divergence objective function , the cb - member filter based strategy outperforms the phd filter based counterparts in terms of miss distance by approximate 10 m in steady state . on the other hand , among cb - member based strategies , the ospa curves of the cardinality variance based approaches decrease faster than that of the rnyi divergence based counterpart and are marginally lower in steady state as shown in fig .",
    "this is because the cardinality variance based control strategies tend to drive the sensor more quickly towards targets which are initially present and tend to respond more sensitively to the birth of new targets .",
    "in contrast the rnyi divergence based control strategies tend to favour existing targets as they are on average more informative in terms of the objective function . as expected however , among the cardinality variance based approaches , the computational savings realized by the non sampling approach incur a slightly higher estimation error . to sum up ,",
    "the results of figure  [ fig2 ] indicate that , if the sensor obtains sufficient information on the target states , all cb - member based control strategies are effective and outperform the phd based counterparts .",

    "we now consider range only measurements and assume no target birth or death .",

    "it is clear that the rnyi divergence based strategy performs better , although neither control strategy achieves a sufficiently low ospa error .",
    "the under - performance of both strategies can be explained by the lack of observability of the full states , as we now have range - only measurements .",
    "minimizing the cardinality variance tends to drive the observer to a position where all the targets have roughly the same range so that the sensor can detect each of the targets equally well .",
    "however for range only sensors , this results in difficulty resolving the targets . on the other hand , an information theoretic criterion such as the rnyi divergence tends to account for both localization and cardinality criteria ( albeit indirectly ) , and at least in this particular scenario , results in a different control policy with a lower error .",

    "the cb - member filter was used to efficiently but approximately propagate a parametrized representation of the multi - object posterior density , which was then used to calculate a reward function in order to determine the action of the sensor . using the particle cb - member filter not only allowed a conventional reward function , such as the rnyi divergence , to be calculated efficiently , but also enabled the estimated cardinality variance , which admits an analytic solution and provides direct control of cardinality estimation error , to be used as an objective function . in the latter case , a computationally fast control algorithm that does not require",

    "numerical examples were presented , showing that when the sensor measurements are reasonably informative , with a high observabilityof the targets , both proposed control strategies work well . however , in pathological cases where there is low observability  of targets , even though performance of both control policies degrades , the decrease in performance is noticeably worse for the cardinality variance based approach compared to the rnyi divergence based approach .",
