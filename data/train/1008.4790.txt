    "when dealing with the numerical integration of canonical hamiltonian systems in the form @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the identity matrix of dimension @xmath8 ) , two main lines of investigation may be traced in the current literature , having as objective the definition and the study of symplectic methods and energy - conserving methods , respectively .",
    "in fact , the symplecticity of the map and the conservation of the energy function are the most relevant features characterizing a hamiltonian system .    from the very beginning of this research activity , high order symplectic formulae were already available within the class of runge - kutta methods @xcite , the gauss collocation formulae being one noticeable example",
    ". one important implication of symplecticity of the discrete flow , for gauss - legendre methods , is the conservation of quadratic invariants .",
    "this circumstance makes the symplecticity property of the method particularly appealing in the numerical simulation of isolated mechanical systems in the form , since it provides a precise conservation of the total angular momentum during the time evolution of the state vector . as a further positive consequence",
    ", a symplectic method also conserves quadratic hamiltonian functions ( see the monographs @xcite for a thorough analysis of symplectic methods ) .",
    "conversely , if one excludes the quadratic case , energy - conserving methods were initially not known within classical integration methods .",
    "the unsuccessful attempts to derive energy - preserving runge - kutta methods for polynomial hamiltonians , culminated in the general feeling that such methods could not even exist ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a completely new approach is represented by _",
    "discrete gradient methods _ which are based upon the definition of a discrete counterpart of the gradient operator so that energy conservation of the numerical solution is guaranteed at each step and whatever the choice of the stepsize of integration ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the conservation of energy has been approached by means of the definition of the _ discrete line integral _ , in a series of papers ( such as @xcite ) , leading to the definition of _ hamiltonian boundary value methods ( hbvms ) _ ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "they are a class of methods able to preserve , in the discrete solution , polynomial hamiltonians of arbitrarily high degree ( and , hence , a _",
    "practical _ conservation of any sufficiently differentiable hamiltonian .",
    "such methods admit a runge - kutta formulation which reveals their close relationship with classical collocation formulae @xcite . an infinity extension of hbvms has also been proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these limit methods may be interpreted as a generalization of the _ averaged vector field method _ defined in @xcite .",
    "attempts to incorporate both symplecticity and energy conservation into the numerical method will clash with two non - existence results .",
    "the first @xcite refers to non - integrable systems , that is systems that do not admit other independent first integrals different from the hamiltonian function itself . according to the authors words ,",
    "it states that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if [ the method ] is symplectic , and conserved @xmath9 exactly , then it is the time advance map for the exact hamiltonian system up to a reparametrization of time . _",

    "we prefer the use of the term `` integrator '' rather than method since , strictly speaking , our integrator may select a different symplectic formula from one integration step to the next , in order to enforce the energy conservation property . in",
    "what follows , we sketch the main ideas behind this approach . for further generalizations , as well as for a number of numerical evidences",
    ", we refer to @xcite",
    ". we will begin with introducing a family of one - step methods @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the stepsize of integration ) , depending on a real parameter @xmath0 , with the following specifics :    1 .   for any fixed choice of @xmath14 ,",
    "the corresponding method is a symplectic runge - kutta method with @xmath3 stages and of order @xmath4 , which exactly conserves all quadratic invariants ; 2 .   for @xmath15 one",
    "gets the gauss collocation method ( of order @xmath2 ) ; 3 .   for any choice of @xmath16 and in a given range of the stepsize @xmath13 , there exists a value of the parameter , say @xmath17 , depending on @xmath16 and @xmath13 , such that @xmath18 ( energy conservation ) .    the parametric method ( [ met_alpha ] ) realizes a symplectic perturbation of the gauss method of size @xmath5 .",
    "under suitable assumptions , as the parameter @xmath0 ranges in a small interval centered at zero , the value of the numerical hamiltonian function @xmath19 will match @xmath20 thus leading to energy conservation .",
    "this result is formalized as follows :    [ theo1 ] under suitable assumptions , there exists a real sequence @xmath21 such that the numerical solution defined by @xmath22 , with @xmath16 defined in ( [ hamilode ] ) , satisfies @xmath23 .",
    "one important remark is in order to clarify this statement and how it relates to the above non - existence results .",
    "let us select the value of the parameter @xmath24 , if any , in order to enforce the energy conservation between the two state vectors @xmath16 and @xmath25 , as indicated at item 3 above is now maintained constant , otherwise the map would fail to be symplectic .",
    "] : the map @xmath26 is symplectic and , by definition , assures the energy conservation condition @xmath27 .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that it would fail to provide a conservation of the hamiltonian function if we changed the initial condition @xmath16 or the stepsize @xmath13 .",
    "for example , in general for any @xmath28 , we would obtain @xmath29 : in this case we should change the value of the parameter @xmath0 in order to recover the equality condition",
    ". that will satisfy theorem [ theo1 ] starting at @xmath30 will differ from the sequence @xmath21 .",
    "such sequences will be defined as the solution of the nonlinear system ( [ concon ] ) , as described in the next section . ] strictly speaking , the energy conservation property described in theorem  [ theo1 ] weakens the standard energy conservation condition mentioned in the two non - existence results stated above and hence our methods are not meant to produce a counterexample of these statements .",
    "let  @xmath31   and  @xmath32   be the abscissae and the weights of the gauss - legendre quadrature formula in the interval @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "we consider the legendre polynomials @xmath34 of degree @xmath35 , for @xmath36 , shifted and normalized in the interval @xmath33 $ ] so that @xmath37 , for @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the kronecker symbol ) , and the @xmath40 matrix @xmath41 .",
    "our starting point is the following well - known decomposition of the butcher array @xmath42 of the gauss method of order @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is defined as @xmath45 we now consider the matrix @xmath46 obtained by perturbing as follows : @xmath47 where @xmath0 is a real parameter ,  @xmath48 ,   and , as usual ,  @xmath49   is the @xmath50th unit vector .",
    "the family of methods ( [ met_alpha ] ) we are interested in , is formally defined by the following tableau ( see ( [ a])([xs_alpha ] ) ) : @xmath51 therefore @xmath52 and , moreover , the following result holds true @xcite .    for any fixed value of @xmath0 ,",
    "the runge - kutta method ( [ qgauss ] ) is symmetric and symplectic . for @xmath15 , the usual gauss - legendre method of order @xmath2",
    "is recovered . for any fixed @xmath53 , a method of order @xmath4",
    "is obtained .",
    "if we can choose @xmath54 so that the energy - conservation property be satisfied , then , one obtains a _",
    "( symmetric ) , energy and quadratic invariants preserving ( equip ) method _ , as specified in theorem [ theo1 ] , of gaussian type .",
    "indeed , the conservation of quadratic invariants easily follows from the structure of the matrix ( [ xs_alpha ] ) defining the method . in conclusion",
    ", these methods will provide an exact conservation of all quadratic invariants , besides the hamiltonian function . in more details ,",
    "if we denote , as usual , @xmath55 the vector of the stages , @xmath56 , and defining the error function @xmath57 , the nonlinear system , in the unknowns @xmath58 and @xmath0 , that is to be solved at each step for getting energy conservation , reads , for the given stepsize @xmath13 , @xmath59 concerning the question about the existence of a solution of , we make the following assumptions :    * the function @xmath60 is analytical in a rectangle @xmath61 \\times [ -\\bar h , \\bar h]$ ] centered at the origin ; * let @xmath62 be the order of the error in the hamiltonian function associated with the gauss method applied to the given hamiltonian system and the given state vector @xmath16 , that is : @xmath63 then , we assume that for , any fixed @xmath64 in a suitable neighborhood of the origin , @xmath65    we observe that , excluding the case where the hamiltonian @xmath11 is quadratic ( which would imply @xmath66 , for all @xmath0 ) , the error in the numerical hamiltonian function associated with the gauss method is expected to behave as @xmath67 .",
