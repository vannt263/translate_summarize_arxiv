    "low energy bombardment of the surface of amorphous materials @xcite , semiconductors ( amorphized by the sputtering processs ) @xcite , and metallic materials ( at low temperature ) @xcite , by a beam of ions at off - normal incidence , often lead to ripple pattern formation .",
    "the ripple orientation is perpendicular to the projection of the ion beam direction , onto the surface plane , for small incidence angles , and parallel to the projection for grazing incidence .",
    "however , for a metallic surface with anisotropic diffusion , the orientation is perpendicular to a crystallographic direction ( the one favored for diffusion ) at small incidence angle @xcite .    according to the continuum theory @xcite ,",
    "ripples arise , for all angles of incidence @xmath5 , from the curvature dependence of the sputter yield .",
    "the basis of the calculation is the sigmund distribution @xcite describing the energy deposited by the incoming ion .",
    "this distribution results from a study of the collision cascades created by the penetrating ion .",
    "the sigmund distribution is parametrized by the depth @xmath6 , the longitudinal straggle @xmath7 , and lateral straggle @xmath1 of the energy , cf .",
    "( [ eq : sigmund ] ) . the wavelength @xmath8 obtained within the continuum theory",
    "is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the surface diffusivity , and @xmath11 is a negative surface tension coefficient , the latter depending on @xmath12 and @xmath5 .",
    "typical wavelengths are of the order of tens of nanometers . in the absence of non - linearities ,",
    "the @xmath5 dependent @xmath11 , being different along the parallel and perpendicular directions to ion projection , govern the ripple orientation .",
    "however , contrary to the predictions of the continuum theory ( ccf .",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 of @xcite ) , no ripples were observed in @xcite for @xmath15 under xe ion irradiation of si .",
    "other studies have shown that this influence of collision cascading on topography evolution extends to quantum dot formation at @xmath16 on non - rotated substrates@xcite , and at @xmath17 on rotated substrates @xcite .",
    "also , collision cascade statistics has recently been found to shift @xcite the sigmund energy distribution away from the gaussian which has been the basis of the theoretical models so far in use @xcite .",
    "but till now the ripple phase boundaries arising from such influence are thought to be time ( i.e. fluence ) independent .",
    "furthermore , up till now , dependence of ripple formation on the lateral straggle @xmath1 , though acknowledged , is often ignored on accounts of isotropic or symmetric cascading for simplicity .",
    "recently a discrete mc model of sputter - erosion was introduced @xcite which , like the continuum theories , is based on sigmund s spatial distribution of the kinetic energy transfered by an impinging ion .",
    "its very recent application to the study of ripple motion @xcite indicates its capture of the universal features of material - surface modification by ion beam treatment , and affords us a way of exploring the different phases in the surface morphology .    in this paper , we extend this model with inclusion of lateral erosion .",
    "this includes stronger non - linearities in the sputtering process .",
    "hence , the exponential - growth tendency of the ripple amplitude occuring within the linear theory is more stabilized @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we show that the angle @xmath18 above which ripple formation occurs depend on the longitudinal straggle @xmath7 of the ion beam , with higher @xmath7 resulting in lower @xmath18 . moreover",
    ", we find that there are two distinct creation mechanism for ripple : in one region of the parameter space , there is a transition from hole topography at an early time , to ripple topography at a later time . for other parameters ,",
    "the ripples are created from a simple rough topography at early times .",
    "our results also indicate the crucial role of the value of @xmath1 for ripple formation . if we chose @xmath1 larger enough , then we find dots / nano - sized islands similar to those observed by @xcite , and predicted by @xcite without sample rotation .",
    "our results suggest that by using new projectil / target combinations one might find yet unobserved surface topologies .",
    "we mention below some promising projectil / target combinations which might serve as guidelines for experimentalists .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe our simulation model . in the main part we present and discuss our results .",
    "we finish with a summary and discussion .",
    "sketch showing lateral erosion of surface atoms , and collision cascade geometry , as described in the text .",
    "erosion of atom at position @xmath19 or @xmath20 triggers a relaxation , which ensures there is no overhang ; the atom at position @xmath21 or @xmath22 is only eroded , without surface relaxation.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we study system sizes @xmath23 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the material surface is defined by a time - dependent discrete height function @xmath24 [ @xmath25 solid - on - solid ( sos ) model ] which is initially flat , i.e , @xmath26constant .",
    "hence , overhangs can not occur .",
    "we have included surface roughening via sputtering and surface smoothing via surface diffusion .",
    "each simulation step consist of the sputtering generated by one ion and a certain number of diffusion steps .",
    "the simulation time is measured in terms of these steps and corresponds to the fluence in experiments .",
    "for details see ref .",
    "here we only display the main ingredients of the methods , for the convenience of the reader , and describe the extensions with respect to the original method .",
    "we simulate the sputtering process as a combination of ion motion and erosion of atoms .",
    "the ion source , at some random position in a plane directly above the surface plane , projects the ions along a trajectory inclined at @xmath5 to the vertical and with azimuth @xmath27 . after penetrating the solid through a depth @xmath6 , measured along the ion trajectory",
    ", each ion comes to rest and distributes its kinetic energy @xmath28 .",
    "the erosion process is governed by the generally accepted sigmund @xcite distribution .",
    "a surface atom is eroded with a probability proportional to the energy deposited there , which is given by sigmunds s formula @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the distance of the surface atom , from the final stopping point of the ion , along the ion trajectory .",
    "@xmath31 is the distance of the surface atom perpendicular to the ion trajectory .",
    "hence , we use the local coordinate system of the ion with origin at the point of penetration , and the @xmath32-axis coinciding with the ion trajectory @xcite . a sketch is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : sputter ] .",
    "note that all parameters depend on the experimental parameters like materials , ion energy and angle of incidence . for amorphous materials",
    "they can be estimated using the srim simulation package @xcite . except where otherwise stated ,",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is chosen to be @xmath37 , while , in contrast to previous studies , we vary systematically the values of @xmath1 and @xmath7 mimicing different material combinations .    furthermore",
    ", we extend the sputtering model by considering lateral erosion of surface atoms ; thus including non - linearity in a manner analogous to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( @xmath38 ) non - linearity that arises from lateral attachment of adatoms in surface growth @xcite .",
    "this has the effect of relaxing the surface @xcite ( expecially as local surface slopes increase , since @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of surface atoms eroded in column @xmath41 at that instant , due to their being closer to the stopping point of ion than topmost atom in column ( see fig . [",
    "fig : sputter ] ) .",
    "surface migration is simulated @xcite as a nearest neighbor monte carlo hopping process , with a site @xmath41 and nearest neighbor site @xmath42 chosen randomly ; and a hop @xmath43 allowed with probability @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an energy barrier to hopping , comprising of a substrate term @xmath46 , a nearest neighbor term @xmath47 and a step barrier term @xmath48 ; @xmath49 is the number of in - plane nearest neighbors of the diffusing atom ; @xmath50 is the substrate temperature ; and @xmath51 is the boltzmann s constant .",
    "@xmath52 if there is no vacant next - nearest neighbors in the plane below the hopping atom ( at site @xmath41 ) , and there is _ at least _ a vacant next - nearest neighbor in the plane below the hopped atom ( at site @xmath42 ) ; otherwise @xmath53 .",
    "thus this model discourages diffusion to a down - step edge but once the approach is made , it does not discourage a hop down the step ( i.e since @xmath53 then ; see fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "a local heating of the surface occurs right after ion impact , followed by rapid cooling ; hence surface diffusion is greatly enhanced , due to higher effective temperatures arising from the ion impacts .",
    "consequently , we have used a higher effective temperature @xmath54 in our simulations , which was estimated in our previous work @xcite , based on a calculation of the spatio - temporal development of the temperature , arising from the local heating @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the profiles shown in the figures are from sizes @xmath55 , and the bar , on the profiles , indicate the ion beam direction .",
    "distances are in units of a lattice constant , and time in ions / atom ; except where stated otherwise . by varying the collision cascade parameters @xmath7 and @xmath1",
    ", we explore the full topographic features of this sputter - erosion model , for typical ion energies on the order of @xmath19kev ; keeping @xmath6 and @xmath5 constant .",
    "we start with a sketch ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] ) of the six topographic regions that were found , coresponding to different combinations of @xmath7 and @xmath1 , for @xmath56 ions / surface atom at which almost all the surface topographic features are distinct ; the corresponding profiles are shown in fig [ fig : phase_profiles ] .",
    "note that the boundaries shown in this sketch do not represent abrupt transitions from one topography to another , as we shall see below ( in figs .",
    "[ fig : q - mu ] , [ fig : q - sigma ] ) .",
    "rather we observe often a smooth crossover from one behavior to the other .",
    "note that the system is still not in ( dynamic ) equilibrium @xcite , hence the surface morphology still evolves with time and at later time a diagram of the type of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] will look different .",
    "we have picked a typical time , corresponding to timescales easily accessible in experiments , which exhibit a rich behavior as a function of the straggling parameters @xmath1 and @xmath7 . also ,",
    "although the sketch is specifically at @xmath57 , similar `` phases '' also occur at other values of @xmath5 , with slight deviations at the boundaries .",
    "examples of a few experimental parameters ( ion energy , type of material , type of ion etc . ) which lead to the specific parameters used here we obtained from a srim simulation @xcite , are ; region v : @xmath58 neon(ne)-ion , or @xmath59 argon(ar)-ion , sputtering of copper(cu ) , or silver(ag ) ; @xmath60 ne - ion , or @xmath61 ar - ion , sputtering of germanium(ge ) , or gallium arsenide(gaas ) ; @xmath62 helium(he)-ion sputtering of graphite(c ) ; region iv : @xmath63 ne - ion sputtering of silicon(si ) ; region iii : @xmath64 ar - ion sputtering of silicon(si ) ; @xmath65 ne - ion sputtering of c ; with fluences @xmath66 ions/@xmath67 .",
