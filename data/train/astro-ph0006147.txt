    "the circinus galaxy is a large , highly inclined ( @xmath6 ) , spiral galaxy of uncertain morphological type seen through a galactic window with low extinction ( a@xmath7 = 1.5 @xmath8 0.15 mag ) at b = 4@xmath9 ( freeman et al . 1977 ) .",
    "it contains both a type 2 seyfert nucleus and a circumnuclear starburst and , in view of its proximity ( distance 4 @xmath8 1 mpc , thus 1@xmath10 = 19 pc ) , has been intensively studied in recent years .",
    "the seyfert activity was first found through the discovery of water vapor megamaser emission ( gardner & whiteoak 1982 ) , a phenomenon apparently associated exclusively with seyfert or liner - type active nuclei ( braatz , wilson & henkel 1997 ) .",
    "individual water vapor maser spikes vary on timescales as short as a few minutes ( greenhill et al . 1997 ) and the masing gas traces a thin accretion disk about 0.8 pc in radius with , in addition , a significant population of masers that lie away from the disk and may be in outflow ( greenhill et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum below 10 kev exhibits a flat continuum and a very prominent iron line , indicative of compton scattering and fluorescent emission from gas illuminated by an obscured x - ray continuum source ( matt et al .",
    "recent observations above 10 kev have revealed excess emission above an extrapolation of the 0.1 - 10 kev spectrum suggesting that , at the higher energies , the nucleus is seen directly through a column density of @xmath11 4 @xmath12 10@xmath13 @xmath14 ( matt et al .",
    "optical and near infrared spectrophotometry of the nucleus show a typical seyfert spectrum , including strong coronal lines ( oliva et al .",
    "1994 ; maiolino et al .",
    "emission lines from highly ionized species are also found in a 2.5 - 45 @xmath3 m spectrum obtained with iso ( moorwood et al .",
    "the gas is generally believed to be photoionized though quite different photoionization models ( moorwood et al . 1996 ; binette et al .",
    "1997 ; oliva , marconi & moorwood 1999 ) can reproduce the observed emission - line ratios .",
    "optical spectropolarimetry reveals polarized and relatively broad ( fwhm @xmath11 3,300 km s@xmath15 ) h@xmath1 emission from a region @xmath4 60 pc in extent centered on the nucleus , indicating the presence of a ` hidden ' broad line region ( oliva et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "highly ionized gas extends along the minor axis of the galaxy , with a morphology that widens with increasing distance from the nucleus and is reminiscent of the so - called ` ionization cones ' seen in some seyfert galaxies ( marconi et al .",
    "the ` cone ' in circinus does not , however , show the filled structure with sharp , straight edges seen in some other seyferts ( e.g. ngc 5728 , wilson et al . 1993 ) and which strongly suggests the gas is ionized by a shadowed nuclear uv source .",
    "a complex of ionized filaments is found within the ` cone ' and extending radially from the nucleus out to distances of 1 kpc , as well as arcs suggestive of bow shocks at the termini of some of these filaments ( veilleux & bland - hawthorn 1997 ; elmouttie et al .",
    "the filamentary gas appears to be flowing outwards from the nucleus at velocities of 200 km s@xmath15 or higher . in the radio continuum ( elmouttie et al .",
    "1995 , 1998b ) , there is a compact ( @xmath4 20 pc diameter ) flat spectrum nuclear source plus an extended cross - like structure .",
    "one arm of the cross extends along the galaxy disk , and is believed related to star formation activity , while the other extends orthogonal to it .",
    "the orthogonal radio features are strongly polarized and comprise a bi - symmetric plume and edge - brightened lobes .    a circumnuclear star - forming ring of diameter @xmath16 200 pc is delineated by hii regions and seen clearly in h@xmath1 images ( marconi et al . 1994 ; elmouttie et al .",
    "there is also a molecular disk ( elmouttie et al .",
    "1998c ) or ring ( curran et al . 1998 ) of radius @xmath11 300 pc which presumably provides the gas for the star formation .",
    "iso spectra show pah features between 5 and 12 @xmath3 m which are remarkably similar to those found in ` pure ' starburst spectra .",
    "there are also lines from h@xmath17 and low excitation ionic species , both believed to be associated with star forming regions ( moorwood et al .",
    "the distribution and kinematics of the h@xmath2v=10s(1 ) line have been studied from the ground via imaging ( maiolino et al .",
    "1998 ; davies et al . 1998 ) and long slit spectroscopy ( storchi - bergmann et al . 1999 ) . high resolution br@xmath18 imaging ( maiolino et al . 1998 ) has been interpreted in terms of ongoing star formation activity within a few tens of pc of the active nucleus .",
    "maiolino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find that , between the 100 pc and 10 pc scales , the stellar population is relatively young with an age between 4 @xmath12 10@xmath19 and 1.5 @xmath12 10@xmath20 yrs .",
    "they argue that the starburst may have propagated outwards from the nucleus to the 200 pc diameter ring , where hot young stars are currently forming .",
    "the luminosity of the starburst within a 200 pc radius is @xmath16 1.7 @xmath12 10@xmath21 l@xmath22 ( maiolino et al . 1998 ) , while the luminosity of the seyfert nucleus is comparable at @xmath11 10@xmath21 l@xmath22 ( moorwood et al .",
    "together , the two contribute most of the luminosity of the galaxy ( maiolino et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the proximity of this seyfert plus circumnuclear starburst galaxy invites further study .",
    "the connection between nuclear activity and circumnuclear star formation is a topic of great current interest ( e.g. cid fernandes & terlevich 1995 ; genzel et al .",

    "; heckman et al .",
    "1997 ; gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "1998 ) but can only be probed by high spatial resolution observations .",
    "high spatial resolution imaging is also needed to investigate the origin and nature of the gaseous outflow within the `` ionization cone '' .",
    "such observations can also potentially investigate the morphology of the gas and dust responsible for the obscuration of the nucleus in type 2 seyferts .    in this paper , we report an optical and near infrared imaging study of the circinus galaxy with the hubble space telescope , which provides a resolution better than 01 ( 2 pc ) at optical wavelengths .",
    "we have obtained images in the gaseous emission lines [ oiii ] @xmath05007 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath2v=10s(1 ) at 2.12 @xmath3 m , and in the green ( 5470  ) , red ( 8140  ) and near infrared ( 2.04 and 2.15 @xmath3 m ) continua .",
    "in addition , we have obtained an image in the [ fe ii ] @xmath01.644 @xmath3 m line with a ground - based telescope .",
    "as part of go program # 7273 , the circinus galaxy was observed by hst with the wfpc2 instrument on april 10 , 1999 .",
    "this target lies at the heart of the southern continuous viewing zone ( cvz ) , allowing us to obtain 3500 seconds of exposure in a single orbit .",
    "the galaxy was centered on the pc chip , in order to obtain the maximum spatial resolution on the nucleus and ionization cone regions .",
    "images were obtained through filters isolating the emission lines of [ oiii]@xmath05007 ( f502n ) and h@xmath1 ( f656n ) , as well as corresponding green and red continuum regions ( filters f547 m and f814w ) .",
    "the exposure times were @xmath23 seconds and @xmath24 seconds for the  and h@xmath1 imagery , respectively .",
    "no anomalies were reported during the observation period .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard fashion , using the iraf / stsdas software package .",
    "although the data were received in calibrated form , they were recalibrated and reduced in order to take advantage of more up - to - date calibration reference files .",
    "this procedure was accomplished by the calwp2 task , which removes the ccd bias level , subtracts the dark current component , and flat fields the pixel - to - pixel response of the chips .",
    "cosmic rays were removed by combining two images in each of the separate filters , using the anticorrelation technique implemented in the crreject task .",
    "the images were carefully surveyed by hand and additional cosmic rays identified and removed by interpolation .    the data were flux - calibrated using the synphot package for synthetic photometry , together with the most recent hst filter and telescope throughput tables .",
    "a corresponding continuum image was constructed for each narrowband image by assuming a linear continuum and interpolating from the broadband images .",
    "the alignment of the images was then verified using a number of stars in the fields ; small offsets were applied .",
    "the continuum was subtracted from each of the narrowband images to derive maps of the h@xmath1 and  line flux .",
    "we produced maps encompassing the entire 160  field of the wfpc2 instrument ( 01 pixel@xmath15 ) , as well as the 36  field of the high - resolution pc chip ( 0046 pixel@xmath15 ) .",
    "we have also produced a map of the line ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath1 and of the continuum color v ",
    "i. each of the [ oiii ] and h@xmath1 images was `` clipped '' at a signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio of 1 .",
    "the line ratio map was calculated at all points where _ either _ map has s / n @xmath25 1 . because h@xmath1 is seen from all gas which emits [ oiii ] , but [ oiii ] is detected from only the high excitation gas",
    ", our procedure implies that the calculated ratio is an actual measurement only where [ oiii ] is detected , and an upper limit elsewhere ( in hii regions ionized by hot stars , for example ) .",
    "the f656n filter has a peak transmission at 6561  and a width @xmath26 = 21.4  ( as defined in the wfpc2 instrument handbook ) . at the heliocentric systemic velocity of circinus ( 439 @xmath8 2 km s@xmath15 ; freeman et al .",
    "1977 ) , both [ nii]@xmath06548 and h@xmath1 fall on the flat part of maximal transmission in the filter profile . because there is very little gas with recession velocity below 100 km s@xmath15 ( see fig . 4 of elmouttie et al .",
    "1998a ) , the contribution of [ nii]@xmath06583 to our f656n image is always negligible . in hii regions",
    "f([nii]@xmath06548 ) @xmath27 f(h@xmath1 ) and so [ nii ] is a negligible contributor to the image in these regions .",
    "there will be some contribution from [ nii]@xmath06548 in the high excitation gas ; this contribution is difficult to quantify in view of the spatial variation of recession velocity and the minimal number of published measurements of the spatial dependence of f([nii]@xmath06548)/f(h@xmath1 ) . with this caveat",
    ", we shall refer to the continuum - subtracted f656n image as `` h@xmath1 '' .",
    "an additional 4 cvz orbits were used to observe the circinus galaxy with the nicmos camera 2 through filters f204 m , f212n ( on - band h@xmath2v=10s(1 ) ) , and f215n ( off - band h@xmath2 ) .",
    "a total of 6656seconds was spent on the galaxy in each of the narrow - band filters , using five different dither positions .",
    "these were bracketted by two 128-second on - source observations in the f204 m filter , both taken at the same position . at the time of designing the nicmos observations , the temporal stability of the thermal background",
    "was not known .",
    "therefore , three regions of sky located approximately 10 arcminutes from the center of the galaxy were also observed to facilitate background subtraction ; observations of 512seconds each in the f212n and f215n filters were made at the start , middle , and end of the visit , and observations of 256seconds with the f204 m filter were made at the start and end of the visit .",
    "the first step in the data reduction was to perform a subtraction of the nicmos ` pedestal ' using software written and kindly provided by r. van der marel .",
    "a study of the background images revealed no significant variations in either structure or count rate , and these were therefore combined , using median filtering to remove galactic stars , to produce a single background image for each filter .",
    "the images taken at each dither position in the f212n and f215n filters were stacked and background - subtracted .",
    "they were then combined using the calnicb task with integer pixel shifts determined from centroiding of the bright nucleus .",
    "the two f204 m images were similarly combined , although no shift was necessary .    as a final step ,",
    "an image of the h@xmath2v=10s(1 ) emission line only was constructed by subtracting an estimated continuum level from the f212n line - plus - continuum image .",
    "several combinations of the f204 m and f215n ( which possessed similar signal - to - noise ratios ) were investigated , with there being no significant differences between the results .",
    "we therefore chose to construct a continuum image at the pivot wavelength of the f212n filter by assuming that the continuum @xmath28 was a linear function of @xmath0 between the f204 m and f215n filters .",
    "infrared images of circinus were obtained through an h - band filter and a narrow - band [ feii]@xmath01.644@xmath3 m filter using the cirim imager at the 4 m blanco telescope at ctio on the night of may 25 1999 .",
    "the total integration times were 180 s for the h - band and 1800 s for the narrow - band observation , which was split into 9 individual exposures .",
    "sky frames were obtained at 10@xmath29 from the galaxy .",
    "the scale was 021 pix@xmath15 , and the seeing was @xmath30 09 .",
    "reduction of the ground - based images followed standard procedures in iraf .",
    "the images were corrected for extinction using average coefficients for cerro tololo ( frogel , 1998 ) . because the weather became cloudy before a standard star could be observed , flux calibration of the h- and narrow - band images was performed using the aperture photometry of moorwood & glass ( 1984 ) .",
    "we have adopted the h - band image as the continuum ( off - band ) for the [ feii]@xmath31 m image , because the bad weather precluded obtaining a continuum image through a narrower filter .",
    "two potential problems must be considered when adopting this procedure .",
    "first , the h filter contains the [ feii ] @xmath32 m line . from storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we estimate that the equivalent width of the [ feii ] @xmath33 m line ( which has comparable flux to the 1.644@xmath3 m line - [ feii]@xmath34m/1.257@xmath3 m = 0.74 - nussbaumer & storey 1988 ) is @xmath35 5 , much less than the fwhm @xmath303300  of the h - band filter , and so the contribution of the [ feii ] emission to the h - band image is negligible .",
    "second , the h filter is much wider than the [ feii ] filter .",
    "however , it is approximately centered on the line , so differences in continuum level due to color variations should be small .",
    "the continuum - subtracted [ feii ] image was obtained by scaling the narrow - band image with respect to the h - band image .",
    "we first tried using the scale factor obtained from the ratio between the integrated counts of a field star in the h image and in the [ feii ] image ( only one star in our images was bright enough for this purpose ) .",
    "the resulting subtracted image was negative around the nucleus , indicating that color effects were present , and that we had oversubtracted the galaxy continuum .",
    "we then progressively increased the scale factor used to multiply the [ feii ] image until the negative counts were eliminated .",
    "this was obtained by a 12% increase of the factor obtained from the stellar counts .",
    "the hst optical images obtained with wfpc2 are shown in figs 1 - 5 .",
    "the orientation is such that the major axis of the galaxy ( p.a .",
    "30@xmath9 @xmath8 5@xmath9 ; freeman et al .",
    "1977 ) runs horizontally and the near side ( se ) of the galaxy disk is in the lower part of the panels .",
    "1 shows the large - scale structure of the galaxy in h@xmath1 ( upper panel ) and in the i band continuum ( lower panel ) .",
    "some 15 to the sw of the nucleus ( upper right of figure ) in the h@xmath1 image is a region of emission which is also apparent in the ground - based h@xmath1 imaging of elmouttie et al .",
    "( 1998a , their fig .",
    "elmouttie et al .",
    "note the coincidence of this feature with compact radio continuum emission and argue that it is an hii region .",
    "the absence of [ oiii]@xmath05007 at this location in our images supports this interpretation .",
    "two diffuse patches of line emission , also apparently hii regions and visible in ground - based images ( marconi et al . 1994 ; elmouttie et al . 1995 ) , are found @xmath16 30@xmath10 s of the nucleus .",
    "a linear feature , seen in ground - based [ oiii]@xmath05007 ( veilleux & bland - hawthorn 1997 ) and h@xmath1 + [ nii ] ( marconi et al . 1994 ) images , extends @xmath16 40@xmath10 to the sw of the nucleus , onto the upper right wf chip .",
    "this feature is not detected in our [ oiii]@xmath05007 image and is thus of lower excitation than the high excitation gas ( discussed below ) to the nw of the nucleus ( cf .",
    "fig . 6 of marconi et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the i band image reveals a broad , spiral dust band which sweeps s from the intersection of the pc and upper right wf chips , and then turns e and ne , passing across the point where the four chips intersect and continuing to the left hand edge of the lower left wf chip .",
    "this dust lane coincides with a region of weak h@xmath1 emission between the two diffuse patches noted above and the central , bright region of the galaxy .",
    "the dust lane may obscure line emission in this region ( where the four chips meet ) .",
    "2 shows only the pc chip ; the [ oiii]@xmath05007 image is top left , h@xmath1 is top right , v band is lower left and i band is lower right .",
    "3 is an color display of the pc image of h@xmath1 .",
    "the [ oiii]@xmath05007 image contains a ` v ' shaped structure ( see also fig .",
    "5 ) within 2@xmath10 of the nucleus , plus fine scale radial features extending to the nw . there are also concentrations of bright , high excitation line emission towards the top of the panel , with an overall morphology suggestive of an elliptical ring , which might represent the projection of the end of a tilted , hollow , conical structure , with apex near the nucleus .",
    "in addition to the emission from hii regions ionized by hot stars ( discussed below ) , the h@xmath1 image reveals prominent emission from the [ oiii]-emitting gas , including the v - shaped nuclear structure and the radial features and ` blobs ' to the nw .",
    "the fainter [ oiii]@xmath05007 emission further to the nw , imaged by veilleux & bland - hawthorn ( 1997 ) , is off the top edge of the pc chip .    the h@xmath1 image ( fig . 2 top right , fig .",
    "3 ) reveals the well - known ring of hii regions of radius 8  14@xmath10 .",
    "the ring shows considerable structure , some of which results from obscuration .",
    "for example , a prominent dust band , best seen in the v band image ( fig .",
    "2 , bottom left ) , extends ne  sw 2 ",
    "8@xmath10 s of the nucleus .",
    "the sharp nw edge of this band is seen as a sharp edge in the h@xmath1 emission some 9@xmath10 sw of the nucleus . indeed , the h@xmath1 line emission is weaker and more fragmented to the s of the nucleus than in other directions , apparently a result of obscuration by the dust band .",
    "various other dust bands , extending ne - sw to the se ( bottom of panel ) of the nucleus , are seen in the v- and i - band ( bottom right ) images .",
    "given the projected shape of this ring of hii regions , it can not be an intrinsically circular structure in the plane of the galaxy disk .",
    "close to the nucleus , the h@xmath1 image also shows an elliptical ring of hii regions with radius 2@xmath10 towards the ne ( best seen in figs 5 and 12 ) .",
    "we shall refer to this feature as the `` nuclear ring '' .",
    "the nuclear ring extends more than half way around the nucleus , from s through e to n of the nucleus , with major axis more or less along the galaxy disk ( ne - sw ) .",
    "this morphology suggests the nuclear ring is intrinsically circular in shape , and located in the plane of the galaxy disk ( section 4.2 ) .",

    "4 is an image of the flux ratio [ oiii]@xmath05007/h@xmath1 over the pc chip .",
    "we should bear in mind that this ratio can only be measured in the high excitation gas , where both [ oiii ] and h@xmath1 are detected .",
    "elsewhere , in hii regions where [ oiii ] is undetected , only an upper limit to the ratio is obtained ( section 2.1 ) .",
    "this ratio is typically @xmath35 0.5 in the starburst ring , confirming the low excitation of the gas and commensurate with the values expected for hii regions . in the nuclear ring of hii regions ,",
    "some 2@xmath10 ne of the cone s apex , there is a light band where the upper limit to the ratio is lower at @xmath35 0.1 - 0.5 . extending @xmath25 4@xmath10",
    "nw from the cone s apex are seen the high excitation linear streamers and knots which stand out in the [ oiii ] image ( fig .",
    "2 , top left ) .",
    "the ratio for the streamers within 10@xmath10 of the nucleus is lower than further away ; this might be a result of superposition on background hii regions , of reddening close to the nucleus or of a lower ionization parameter due to a higher gas density near the nucleus .",
    "beyond 10@xmath10 , where the high excitation gas projects outside the starburst ring , the [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ratio of the streamers and knots ranges from 1 to @xmath363 , confirming that this gas has seyfert - type excitation and suggesting that it is little reddened by dust internal to the circinus galaxy .",

    "on the other hand , the highlighted dust lanes on the near sides of galaxy disks are usually understood as an effect of the dusty disk on background bulge light ( hubble 1943 ) .",
    "this interpretation would require a significant contribution from bulge light in the inner few hundred pc of circinus .",
    "it is not clear to us which of these two explanations for the excess of dust lanes and reddening on the near side of circinus is the correct one .",
    "we have used tinytim v4.4 to model the point spread function ( psf ) of nicmos camera 2 .",

    "the sigma - clean algorithm was run for all 121 such resampled psfs , and the psf which gave the largest maximum pixel value in the final image was assumed to be the most accurate representation of the true psf .",
    "the second method involved fitting a de  vaucouleurs @xmath43 law to the azimuthally - averaged radial surface brightness profile over the range of radii @xmath44 , and then extrapolating this to smaller radii .",
    "we then scaled the psf so that the sum of the two components matched the peak of the surface brightness .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "the agreement between the flux densities of the compact nuclear source derived by the two methods is very good .",
    "the discrepancy exceeds 4% only in the f212n filter , where the presence of h@xmath2 emission concentrated near the nucleus has presumably caused the profile fitting method to overestimate the true contribution of the point continuum source .",
    "we opt , therefore , to use the fluxes derived from the sigma - clean deconvolution to investigate the nature of the nucleus , and assume internal errors of 5% on both the f204 m and f215n measurements .",
    "however , comparison of our flux - calibrated nicmos images with ground - based measurements ( moorwood & glass 1984 ; glass & moorwood 1985 ) indicates a systematic discrepancy between the two sets of photometry .",
    "our f212n and f215n images are brighter by 31% and 32% , respectively , in all apertures , while the nucleus contributes only 410% of the total light , depending on the aperture size .",
    "our f204 m image is brighter by 23% assuming a flat spectrum in the @xmath45-band , although the true discrepancy will be slightly larger as the flux density of circinus increases with wavelength ( storchi - bergmann et al.1999 ) .",
    "there thus appears to be a systematic offset of @xmath46% in the nic2 photometry for these three filters .",

    "this value is in excellent agreement with the optical depth of the 9.7  silicate feature observed by moorwood & glass ( 1984 ) , assuming an underlying blackbody spectrum and @xmath54 ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) , and is also consistent with the @xmath55mag inferred by marconi et al .",

    "1999 ) . assuming a normal gas - to - dust ratio , the implied extinction is @xmath57 mag or @xmath58 mag .",
    "this difference indicates that the near - ir continuum originates in regions farther from the nucleus than the x - rays , most probably being re - emission of nuclear radiation by dust .",
    "as the near - ir source is unresolved , the radius of the re - emitting structure is smaller than 2 pc and could be the inner regions of a torus .",
    "alternatively , the inner regions of the torus may have an obscuration similar to that of the x - ray source and thus be invisible in the near infrared .",
    "the observed k band light could then originate from hot dust in the inner part of the narrow line region , perhaps along the polar axis of the torus and heated by nuclear optical - uv light or mass outflow , as may be the case in ngc 1068 ( braatz et al .",
    "1993 ; weinberger et al .",
    "such a geometry provides a natural explanation for the lower obscuration to the near infrared source than to the hard x - ray source .",

    "this agreement supports the view that circinus contains a seyfert 1 nucleus with different obscuring columns to the k band and hard x - ray sources .",
    "it also indicates that the hot dust radiating in the near infrared `` sees '' the dust - heating source ( i.e. the compact optical , uv and x - ray source ) through a smaller column of gas than we do .      the continuum - subtracted image of the h@xmath2v=10s(1 ) emission line is shown in fig .",
    "unfortunately , the strong contribution from the point source results in significant residual artifacts at and near the nucleus .",
    "attempts to remove these , by subtracting a scaled psf from the images before combining them , did not prove successful , and we are therefore unable to learn anything about the structure of the h@xmath2 emission closer than 05 from the nucleus .",
    "the molecular hydrogen extends towards the wsw of the nucleus , in agreement with the inner part of the image in the same line presented by maiolino et al .",

    "the molecular hydrogen emission @xmath16 075 to the wsw of the nucleus is at least three times brighter than that at the same distance ene of the nucleus .",

    "a weak radio continuum source coincides with the [ fe ii ] arc ( davies et al .",

    ". however , the circinus values are consistent with the correlation given its scatter .",
    "the observed 3@xmath10 ( 60 pc ) length of the arc rules out the suggestion ( davies et al .",

    "this low nuclear [ fe ii]@xmath01.257/pa@xmath65 ratio is typical of starbursts ( colina 1993 ; simpson et al .",

    "this result may be contrasted with the situation in the nucleus of ngc 1068 , where blietz et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have found that the [ fe ii ] emission is elongated along the radio jet , and may be powered by jet - driven shocks or photoionized by the active nucleus .",
    "we have discovered a compact ( @xmath16 30 pc ) , sharply - bounded , filled v - shaped region of high excitation gas ( figs 5 and 12 ) .",
    "this gas extends to the nw and projects in the same direction as the larger scale ( @xmath11 500 pc ) ` ionization cone ' ( marconi et al .",
    "1994 ; veilleux & bland - hawthorn 1997 ; elmouttie et al .",
    "both the large scale and small scale ` cones ' undoubtedly extend out of the galaxy disk and are visible because they project against the far side of the disk ; any counter - cone is obscured by dust in the disk .",
    "the opening angle of the compact ` v ' is @xmath16 90@xmath37 and the projection of its edges to larger radii fully envelop the more extended high excitation gas .",
    "it is thus entirely possible that the compact ` v ' represents the projection of a ` classical ionization cone ' - ionizing photons escaping anisotropically from an unresolved source of ionizing photons .",
    "this collimation can result from either shadowing of an isotropic ionizing source by an optically thick torus of gas and dust or intrinsic anisotropy of the continuum source ( e.g. wilson 1992 ) .",
    "the v - shaped structure extends down to our resolution ( @xmath38 01 , see figs 5 , 12 ) , so the collimation must occur on scales @xmath4 2 pc .",
    "krolik & begelman ( 1988 ) state that the position of the inner edge of the torus is determined by a balance between the inward flow of clouds and the rate at which the nuclear continuum can evaporate them .",
    "they estimate that the radius of the inner edge is a few times @xmath66 , where @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the central luminosity in units of 10@xmath69 erg s@xmath15 , @xmath70 is the eddington luminosity and @xmath71 is the compton temperature . according to moorwood et al .",

    "there are clear indications that the simplest picture - an anisotropic ionizing source illuminating ambient gas - is inadequate .",
    "first , kinematic measurements ( veilleux & bland - hawthorn 1997 ; elmouttie et al .",
    "1998a ) show that the gas in the large - scale cone is outflowing .",
    "radio maps show polar radio lobes fueled by outflow from the nuclear region ( elmouttie et al .",
    "second , our [ oiii ] image suggests that the high excitation gas some 200 - 400 pc from the nucleus takes the form of a roughly elliptical annulus ( fig .",
    "2 , upper left ) , suggesting we are viewing the open end of an inclined , circular conical structure extending roughly perpendicular to the galaxy disk .",
    "the cone at this radius seems to be hollow in the [ oiii ] image , presumably as a result of a low density outflowing wind or radio jet which has entrained dense gas along its edges , perhaps from the same compact dense torus which is supposed to collimate the ionizing radiation .",
    "third , the existence of this outflow is a potential source of ionizing photons through photoionizing shocks ( e.g. dopita & sutherland 1995 ) .",
    "the outflow velocities observed - 150  200 km",
    "s@xmath15 - are , however , rather low for production of a significant ionizing luminosity , but higher velocity , lower density gas may also be present .",
    "it is in principle possible that ` v ' shaped structures , like that seen in circinus , simply represent gas seen along low - obscuration lines of sight , with high obscuration to either side .",
    "we do not favor this idea because of the alignment of the compact ` v ' with the larger scale , high excitation gas , which is essentially unobscured .",
    "the region between the obscuring structures ( i.e. the compact ` v ' ) would have to be aligned by chance with the larger scale gas in such a picture .",
    "we thus conclude that the compact ` v ' is either a classical ( ionization - bounded ) ionization cone or a matter - bounded outflow with impressively straight edges .",
    "our h@xmath1 image shows the well known ring of hii regions with radius 150 - 270 pc ( figs 2 and 3 ) .",
    "this image also reveals a much more compact ( radius 40 pc towards the ne ) , clumpy structure of hii regions , which appear to form more than half of a nuclear ring ( section 3.1 , figs 5 and 12 ) .",

    "the major axis of the nuclear ring lies in p.a .",
    "@xmath11 30@xmath9 , close to the major axis of the disk .",
    "further , the major - to - minor axial ratio of the approximately elliptical ring is @xmath11 2.3 , which corresponds to an inclination of @xmath78 if the ring is intrinsically circular .",
    "this inclination is identical to the inclination of the large scale stellar disk - @xmath79 ( freeman et al . 1977 ) .",
    "this agreement between both the major axis and inclination for the compact ring and large scale stellar disk indicates that we are dealing with an intrinsically circular ring in the plane of the disk .",
    "the two star - forming rings probably represent dynamical resonances ( e.g. buta 1995 ) and may result from gas being forced from further out in the galaxy towards the nucleus by oval distortions or bars , such as the 100 pc - long gaseous bar claimed by maiolino et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "it is also of interest to ask how close to the nucleus we see hii regions .",
    "the southern part of the ring projects to within 5 pc of the apex of the ionization cone ( fig .",
    "12 ) . however , if our interpretation is correct , the inner edge of the nuclear ring is actually at least 15 pc from the apex .",
    "there is fainter h@xmath1 emission between the ring and the cone s apex , but it is rather smoothly distributed and could be gas ionized by the hot stars which are presumably present in the ring .",
    "we find no conclusive evidence for hot stars within @xmath11 10 pc of the nucleus , so models of starbursts within this region ( maiolino et al .",

    "the filled v - shaped structure has an opening angle of @xmath16 90@xmath9 and is brightest on its s side , adjacent to the brightest h@xmath17 v = 1 - 0 s(1 ) emission .",

    "the length of the ` v ' ( @xmath11 40 pc ) is consistent with expectations for the half thickness of the galaxy s gas disk , so we are observing the interaction of the seyfert nucleus with the normal gas disk , before the ionizing radiation and outflow break out into the galactic halo .",
    "extension of the arms of the ` v ' to larger radii encompasses the high excitation gas previously imaged in ground - based observations .",
