    "the physical picture of superfluidity and of the superfluid - to - normal transition has been intensely studied .",

    "fermi gases in 2d have been cooled down into the pseudogap regime @xcite , but to date the superfluid - to - normal transition has not been observed in the 2d case .",
    "however , in 2d fermi superfluids the interplay between dimensionality , coherence and interaction turns out to be especially interesting since the coherence originates from the interactions , which is not the case in bose gases . in this contribution",
    ", we investigate this interplay through the calculation of the phase correlation functions for the pair field , where the fermionic pairs can be strongly bound bose - condensed molecules ( bec regime ) or weakly bound cooper pairs ( bcs regime ) .",
    "the physics of superfluidity in uniform two - dimensional fermi gases at nonzero temperatures is not governed by a true pair condensate , because a true condensed state is destroyed by fluctuations .",
    "rather , the signature of superfluidity is the appearance of long - range phase correlations .",

    "the correlation function @xmath1 decays exponentially .",
    "the bkt transition for the ultracold fermi gases in the bcs - bec crossover has been theoretically studied using the long - wavelength approximation for the effective action of the bosonic pair field @xcite .",
    "the phase correlation functions for these bosonic pairs has been considered within the same approximation in ref .",
    "@xcite revealing the algebraic decay in agreement with bkt theory .",
    "however , within the long - wavelength approximation this algebraic decay of the correlation function @xmath1 occurs at all @xmath9 , whereas it is physically expected only at sufficiently large distances .",
    "therefore a treatment beyond the long - wavelength approach is necessary in order to describe phase correlations at large and intermediate distances @xmath9 , and to estimate a spatial range at which the quasi long - range order appears . for ultracold bose gases",
    ", correlations were theoretically studied using different approaches , e. g. , a modified many - body @xmath10-matrix theory @xcite or monte carlo calculations @xcite . for the ultracold fermi gases , to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such a treatment beyond the long - wavelength approach has not yet been performed .    in the present work ,",
    "the phase correlation functions for the pair field are obtained using the gaussian pair fluctuation effective action within the path integral formalism .",
    "this investigation has been inspired by the following reasons . in the long - wavelength treatment of bkt physics in ultracold fermi gases in two dimensions @xcite ,",
    "the long - wavelength hydrodynamic approximation is claimed to be non - perturbative  contrary to the gaussian pair fluctuation ( gpf ) approach ( ref . @xcite and its further developments ) . in other words , it was claimed that the gaussian pair fluctuation approach can not describe the quasicondensate .",
    "here we show that this claim is not true . in recent work",
    "@xcite , a systematic long - wavelength expansion of the effective bosonic action has been developed .",
    "this expansion is non - perturbative with respect to the pair field . on the one hand , when we assume the fluctuations to be slowly varying and perform the long - wavelength approximation for the gpf fluctuation action , we arrive at a fluctuation action in the hydrodynamic limit . on the other hand , when we represent the pair field as a sum of the uniform saddle - point value and a small fluctuation , and substitute this trial pair field to the long - wavelength action functional of ref .",
    "@xcite , we must arrive at the same hydrodynamic limit for the fluctuation action .",
    "however , the coefficients of that action functional do not change when we assume the fluctuations to be small .",
    "we can physically expect that the aforesaid two limiting transitions ( a slow varying pair field and small fluctuations ) commute . in this case , ( 1 ) the phase correlation functions calculated using the gpf action will exhibit an algebraic decay @xmath11 at large distances , ( 2 ) the values of @xmath12 will coincide with those following from the long - wavelength theory . a verification of this hypothesis would help us to bridge the gap between the gpf and non - perturbative long - wavelength approaches for the ultracold fermions .",
