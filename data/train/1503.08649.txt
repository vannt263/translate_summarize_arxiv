    "saddle - point van hove singularities@xcite ( vhss ) originate from saddle points in the band structure , around which the band curvature has opposite signs along two orthogonal directions . in two dimensions ,",
    "the density of states ( dos ) diverges at the vhs , and therefore arbitrary weak interactions can produce large effects in the electronic behaviour , giving rise to instabilities in many aspects such as charge , spin , and/or pairing susceptibilities . once the fermi energy approaches a vhs , ferromagnetism,@xcite antiferromagnetism,@xcite and/or superconductivity@xcite can be substantially enhanced .",
    "the vhs is a topological critical point of the fermi surface , across which the quantum lifshitz phase transition takes place.@xcite the lifshitz transition for noninteracting systems is continuous and does not break symmetry . for interacting systems ,",
    "however , the lifshitz transition may become discontinuous and accompany symmetry breaking .",
    "@xcite in cuprates , hall coefficient measurements provide evidence for the fermi surface topology change .",
    "@xcite the lifshitz transition is also proposed to change the fermi liquid into the marginal fermi liquid,@xcite and the vhs is thus argued to be responsible for the linear temperature ( @xmath2 ) dependence of resistivity and the @xmath2-independent thermopower@xcite observed in this regime.@xcite moreover , in the so - called  van hove scenario \" , the presence of a vhs near the fermi energy is argued to play a major role in the high-@xmath3 superconductivity of cuprates.@xcite given the strong influence of vhss on the properties of materials , it is important to identify the presence and understand the role of these singularities , especially for technologically promising low - dimensional materials like phosphorene .",

    "the core electrons are described via the projected - augmented wave ( paw)@xcite method ; 12.9   of vacuum are added in the direction normal to the monolayer to avoid spurious interactions between periodic replicas .",
    "both lattice parameters and atomic positions are relaxed until the forces on each atom are less than 10@xmath6  ev /   and the pressure is less than 1  kbar . after lattice relaxation ,",

    "we have also shown that the critical temperature can be increased up to 0.05  k by applying a modest strain to the phosphorene pliable waved structure .",
