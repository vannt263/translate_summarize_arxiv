    "thanks to a wealth of observational and theoretical studies of agn from radio to gamma - ray frequencies , radio - loud agn are presently thought to contain relativistic jets which propagate from the nucleus out to kpc and , in some cases , mpc scales .",
    "the power of jets required to at least fuel their radio lobes is huge , up to @xmath2 corresponding to an energy release of @xmath3 erg over a time of @xmath4 yr . in radio - quiet agn , the radio emission is instead weak and large scale radio jets are absent .",
    "although the boundary between these two classes is blurred , strong jets ( in terms of kinetic relative to accretion power ) exist only in a minority of agn .",
    "optical studies of _ nearby _ galaxy nuclei ( capetti & balmaverde 2006 ) have shown that _ all _ radio - loud agn invariably reside in giant _ core _ ( or _ missing  light _ ; kormendy et al .",
    "2009 ) ellipticals , i.e. in early - type galaxies whose nuclear surface brightness profile shows a _ deficit _ in star - light with respect to the outer profile .",
    "by contrast , normal , less massive _ coreless _ ( or _ extra  light _ ; kormendy et al .",
    "2009 ) ellipticals _ all _ host radio - quiet agn ( capetti & balmaverde 2006 ) , suggesting that a _ morphology - related dichotomy _ exists among _ ellipticals _ , likely determined by galaxy evolution .",
    "the dichotomy seems also to emerge from a sample of radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos at redshift @xmath5 , the former residing in giant ellipticals that show signs of interaction , and the latter residing in merging gas - rich galaxies of intermediate mass ( wolf & sheinis 2008 ) .",
    "evidence exists that the most powerful radio and gamma  loud agn are associated to the heaviest supermassive bhs in the universe , with @xmath6 ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2009a , b ) indicating that the bh _ mass _ can be a key parameter for radio - loudness .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the launching of jets from accreting bhs have been extensively studied in the past three decades , following the seminal paper by blandford and znajek ( bz hereafter ; 1978 ) .",
    "the bz process exploits energy extraction from a rapidly rotating black hole via a purely electromagnetic interaction of a large scale magnetic field which threads the rotating event horizon . in this framework , jets are produced at the expense of the rotational energy of the black hole @xmath7c^2 $ ] , where @xmath8 is the dimensionless spin parameter related to the bh spin @xmath9 pointing along @xmath10 ( for a maximally rotating [ @xmath11 kerr bh of @xmath12 , @xmath13 erg ) .",
    "this may suffice to power a jet and to explain why agn with comparable optical luminosities can be either radio - loud ( large @xmath8 ) or radio - quiet ( small @xmath8 , as @xmath14 decays @xmath15 for @xmath16 ) depending on @xmath8 ( wilson & colbert 1995 ; sikora et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "advanced fully general - relativistic magneto - hydrodynamical simulations of spinning bhs ( mckinney 2005 , 2006 ) predict high collimation of the inner poynting flow , bulk lorentz factors of order 10 , and jet powers @xmath17 , or @xmath18 , implying in this last case high jet luminosities only for close to maximally spinning bhs ( tchekhovskoy et al .",
    "another essential ingredient determining the bz power is the value of the magnetic field threading the horizon , which is tied to the accretion rate and disc structure ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2009a ) .",
    "in two recent works , garofalo ( 2009a , b ) stressed the importance of the plunging region between the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco , is at 6 for @xmath19 , and at 9 ( 1 ) for retrograde accretion with @xmath20 ( prograde accretion with @xmath21 ) . ] ) of the accretion disc and the bh horizon . in this region",
    "the magnetic field can be substantially amplified from its value at isco , particularly if the bh has a _ retrograde _ spin vector with respect to the accretion disc angular momentum ( we will use here the convention of negative spin , @xmath22 , for retrograde accretion ) . as a consequence",
    ", high jet powers can be extracted even / also from non - maximally rotating bhs ( garofalo 2009b ) .    here",
    ", we explore the consequences of garofalo s conjecture in the aim at connecting the bh spin and accretion mode to the structure of the underlying host galaxy .",
    "moderately high values of the spin parameter @xmath8 ( @xmath23 ) and retrograde accretion appear to enter as unifying ingredients to account for the radio - loud / host morphology dichotomy observed , at low redshifts , among ellipticals .",
    "these considerations go in the direction of the very recent proposal that most radio - loud agn harbor spinning bhs accreting in the retrograde mode ( garofalo et al .",
    "can retrograde accretion onto a spinning bh be established during galaxy evolution ?      to answer this question in a broader context ,",
    "we first consider _ isolated disc _ galaxies , in which bhs are expected to grow _ only _ by accretion . in these galaxies",
    "bh fueling can occur either via multiple uncorrelated episodes of accretion ( moderski et al .",
    "1998 ) , or via secular bar - in - bar instabilities ( shlosman , frank & begelman 1989 ) that remove gradually the gas angular momentum . in the first mode , episodes of chaotic accretion result in low bh spins ( king & pringle 2006 ; volonteri et al . 2007 ) .",
    "prograde and retrograde accretion change both the bh spin modulus @xmath8 and direction @xmath24 since retrograde orbits carry a larger angular momentum than prograde orbits , random episodes result in average values of @xmath25 . in this scenario ,",
    "retrograde accretion events are common , but the accreting bh is always slowly spinning , so no powerful , long  lived collimated jets are produced . in the second scenario ,",
    "the bh grows through _ coherent _ accretion . even if @xmath26 initially , accretion can spin the bh up to @xmath27 after doubling its mass ( precisely , a factor @xmath28 , bardeen 1970 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the bh spin @xmath29 _ aligns _ with the angular momentum of the accretion disc .",
    "the bh remains in the radio - quiet mode if @xmath30 , as retrograde accretion is unlikely to establish , given the coherence of the flow .",
    "a strong jet in a disc galaxy could be triggered by prograde accretion only if @xmath31 ( tchekhovskoy et al . 2009 ) , but the jet power would be @xmath32 times dimmer than that produced by retrograde accretion onto a maximally spinning bh ( garofalo 2009b ) .",
    "the situation is different in the case of _ major mergers _ , i.e. mergers between galaxies of comparable masses .",
    "galaxy mergers are commonly divided in two classes , gas rich ( or _ wet _ )",
    "mergers where the fraction of cold gas is large ( @xmath33 of the mass in stars ) , and gas poor ( or _ dry _ ) mergers where gas is a small fraction of the stellar mass and has no dynamical effect in the merger .      during a _ wet _ merger ,",
    "the tidal field between the two disc galaxies drives large amounts of gas ( up to @xmath34 of the total gas mass ) toward the centres of the two interacting galaxies ( mayer et al .",
    "when the two nuclei later merge in a single structure , the gas settles into a dense , selfgravitating circumnuclear disc in which the bh relative orbit becomes _ circular _ and _ corotating _ until the bhs form a keplerian binary ( dotti et al .",
    "2009 ) . in this phase",
    ", lasting @xmath35 yr , the bhs accrete in a coherent manner at a rate sufficient to _ align _ their spins , initially oriented at random , to the angular momentum of the nuclear disc ( liu 2004 ; bogdanovic , reynolds & miller 2007 ; dotti et al . 2010 ) : in response to the bardeen  petterson warping of the small  scale accretion discs grown around each bh , total angular momentum conservation imposes fast ( @xmath36 myr ) alignment of the bh spins with the angular momentum of their orbit and so of the large  scale circumnuclear disc ( dotti et al . 2010 ) .",
    "thereafter , accretion remains prograde until coalescence , with no major changes in the bh spin orientation . under these circumstances the bh remnant retains the spin direction of the parent bh spins , both oriented parallel to the angular momentum of their orbit : the post - coalescence bh",
    "may thus acquire a large spin @xmath37 ( berti & volonteri 2008 ; kesden , sperhake & berti 2010 ) , sum of the internal and orbital spins .",
    "because of _ fast alignment _ and spin coherence relative to the flow , _ prograde _ accretion continues even after bh coalescence and so _ no powerful long  lived jets are produced , according to our working hypothesis , unless the bh remnant is close to be maximally rotating .",
    "_    we can also follow the evolution of a wet merger by looking at the properties of the galaxy remnant .",
    "gas rich galaxy mergers are expected to form either spheroids with residual rotation or discs , depending on their initial gas content ( robertson et al .",
    "2006 ) , encounter geometry and the presence of cold gaseous streams flowing onto the evolving remnant ( governato et al .",
    "the stellar nucleus of the relic galaxy can in principle be perturbed by the massive bh binary .",
    "the binary hardens ejecting stars via three - body scatterings ( merritt & milosavljievic 2004 ) creating a",
    "_ stellar core_. the post - coalescence bh can further heat the stellar nucleus if it experiences a strong gravitational  wave induced recoil ( @xmath38 km s@xmath39 ; lousto & zlochower 2009 and references therein ) : in its oscillations back to the galactic centre the bh deposits its kinetic energy expanding further the core ( boylan  kolchin et al .",
    "2004 ; gualandris & merritt 2008 ) .",
    "however , in a gas  rich merger , these effects are strongly suppressed : the stellar deficit by the bh binary is weak since the binary hardens mainly via gaseous torques ( see colpi & dotti 2009 for a review ) and _ extra  light _ is produced following the formation of new stars inside the circumnuclear disc ( hopkins et al .",
    "furthermore , spin - orbit alignment from coherent accretion implies small gravitational kicks for the relic bh , limiting the effect of dynamical heating of the nucleus . as a consequence ,",
    "_ we predict that wet mergers result mostly in radio*quiet * agn hosted by coreless , extra ",
    "light elliptical or spiral galaxies_. figure 1 illustrates schematically the evolution of the two bhs and of the remnant galaxy in a gas  rich merger .",
    "( kormendy & bender 2009 ) .",
    "the bhs that initially inhabit the two galaxies are expected to pair and form a binary _ corotating _ with the disc ( dotti et al .",
    "2009 ) . during inspiral under the action of gas - dynamical torques ,",
    "gas accretion aligns the bh spins to the orbit ( dotti et al .",
    "2010 ) so that the post - coalescence bh has a high ( @xmath1 ) spin and _ corotates _ with the disc . after this phase and",
    "according to our working hypothesis the bh is _ radio - quiet_. we notice that a short - lived radio - loud phase could be present , prior to bh coalescence , before disc - orbit and spin - orbit alignment occur . ]",
    "mergers of _ gas  poor _ galaxies ( e.g. between two ellipticals ) lack massive nuclear gas discs .",
    "the bhs thus complete their inspiral in a collisionless background of stars .",
    "the bh spins are expected to be uncorrelated with the geometry of the encounter , so that , as the binary forms , their spins are randomly oriented relative to the binary orbit .",
    "the bhs may capture gas and experience episodes of retrograde accretion until they merge . at coalescence the bh spin changes in modulus and orientation , and memory",
    "is lost of the initial spin directions .",
    "berti & volonteri ( 2008 ) predict , for isotropic dry mergers , a broad distribution of final spins centred around @xmath40 ( close to the value resulting from the coalescence of two non  spinning bhs ) and also large recoil speeds ( e.g. lousto et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "result of a dry merger is expected to be a _ giant , missing  light _",
    "elliptical whose nuclear region has been shaped by the bh ( hopkins et al .",
    "2009b ; kormendy & bender 2009 ) .",
    "hardening through three ",
    "body scatterings with stars excavates a _",
    "stellar core _ in the nuclear region , further expanded by bh heating by the recoil .",
    "the final giant rapidly spinning bh later settles in the galaxy s centre and starts accreting . in the absence of a rotationally supported nuclear gas structure",
    ", half of the accretion events will be retrograde , and the bh enters the _ radio - loud _ phase .",
    "if the bh is very massive ( @xmath41 ) , as seen in giant ellipticals ( kormendy & bender 2009 ) , we argue that its spin direction remains _ stable _ through all accretion episodes : because of its large bh mass and the lack of a massive nuclear disc , the bh angular momentum likely exceeds the angular momentum carried by the accretion disc ( king et al .",
    "indeed , we note that for giant bhs , the warp radius @xmath42 ( delimiting the distance for gravito - magnetic interaction between the bh and the disc ) exceeds the outer radius of the accretion disc determined by self - gravity , @xmath43 .",
    "following perego et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , for a @xmath12 bh , the outer radius @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 is the schwarzshild radius and @xmath46 the eddington factor ) is smaller than @xmath47 implying that over the bardeen - petterson timescale ( @xmath48 yrs ) the _ entire _ disc _ aligns _ o _ antialigns _ ( depending on the disc s initial orientation ) with the bh spin vector that keeps its orientation stable .",
    "thus the bh can sustain a collimated jet over large scales until accretion ceases .",
    "_ we thus expect radio  loud agn to be hosted in missing ",
    "light , core ellipticals , remnants of dry mergers_. this second scenario is summarized in figure 2 .",
    "( kormendy & bender 2009 ) .",
    "right : the bhs that initially inhabit the two galaxies are expected to pair , form a binary and eventually coalesce under the action of stellar torques .",
    "prior to coalescence the two bhs have arbitrary spin moduli and random orientation . in the gas  poor environment the spins of the giant bhs do not align with the orbit and the post - coalescence bh ends with a high spin @xmath1 and large recoil .",
    "once settled at the centre of the galaxy host the bh may experience episodes of _ retrograde _ accretion ( in 50% of the cases ) and become , according to our hypothesis a _ radio  loud _ agn . in the remaining 50% cases",
    "the bh may be active and become an agn .",
    "observations indeed indicate that giant ellipticals host radio  quiet agn , and this is a natural outcome of our working model . ]",
    "in this note , we propose that _ retrograde _ accretion onto a massive ( @xmath6 ) _ post - coalescence _ spinning bh is conducive to the generation of a powerful large - scale jet , in the gas - poor environment of a giant elliptical with core .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation that radio  loud agn are hosted in bright ellipticals that show a stellar core ( whenever optical data are available ) , and with the recent finding on the dichotomy in radio jet orientations in elliptical galaxies ( browne & battye 2010 ) . in less - louder radio - loud agn , browne and battye find a tendency for the axis of the radio emission to align with the minor axis of the starlight of the host , an oblate rotationally supported elliptical .",
    "by contrast they find no preferred radio - optical alignment among the radio - louder objects possibly hosted in triaxial non - rotating ellipticals .",
    "this study appears to support our evolutionary scheme : coreless ( extra  light ) rotationally supported ellipticals ( kormendy et al .",
    "2009 ) that likely form in gas - rich mergers are expected to host a bh accreting in the prograde mode with a high spin aligned with the angular momentum of the large - scale disc , and so aligned with the minor axis of the starlight . by contrast , core ( missing  light ) triaxial ellipticals are expected to host a bh that has a random spin orientation regardless its accretion mode ( i.e. whether prograde or retrograde ) .",
    "the model rests on garofalo s conjecture that around a retrograde bh , magnetic fields threading the horizon reach maximum amplification , resulting in a dramatic enhancement of the jet power even for non  extreme values of @xmath8 .",
    "the interval of spin values for operation of this process is still weakly constrained by theory .",
    "furthermore _ prograde _ accretion can also result in large bz luminosities ( garofalo 2009a , b ) .",
    "thus , there should exist a _",
    "zone of avoidance",
    "_ delimited by a maximum  negative @xmath49 and a minimum  positive @xmath50 , outside which the generation of jets is possible .",
    "the values of @xmath51 and @xmath50 may not be symmetric as non ",
    "symmetric is the underlying kerr spacetime . if retrograde accretion is a necessary condition _ only _ for the most powerful jets hosted in ellipticals , the value of @xmath51 that our model requires is @xmath52 , resulting from isotropic bh coalescences in dry mergers .",
    "if prograde accretion vehicles the production of jets as well , a value of @xmath50 close to @xmath53 ( from chaotic accretion ) would imply the presence of jets in any type of galaxy , from discs in isolation to spheroids in clusters and groups . the paucity of radio  loud disc hosts and the lack , at low redshift , of radio  loud coreless host ",
    "ellipticals suggest that such a low value of @xmath50 is irrealistic .",
    "one would be tempted to require @xmath54 , according to the models by mckinney ( 2005 ) .",
    "the rotational energy stored in giant bh ( @xmath55 ) may suffice to power a radio  loud agn at an average level of @xmath56 for a lifetime",
    "@xmath57 yr .",
    "however retrograde accretion causes the bh to spin down on a time @xmath58 min(@xmath59 ) .",
    "spin  down by accretion occurs on @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the _ net _ inflow rate onto the bh , and @xmath62 the angular momentum per unit mass of a test particle at isco ) .",
    "@xmath63 is close to the salpeter time for @xmath64folding of the bh mass .",
    "the bz timescale @xmath65 depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field that threads the horizon and on the thermal / geometrical structure of the accretion disc ( moderski et al .",
    "1998 ) . in garofalo s scenario ,",
    "retrograde accretion is a transitory phase during the lifetime of a bh ( garofalo et al .",
    "2010 ) whose duration and recurrence depend on the way the bh is fed whether through continuous or chaotic accretion",
    ".    recent observations of extremely bright blazars with bat/_swift _ at redshifts @xmath66 ( ajello et al .",
    "2009 ; ghisellini et al . 2009a ) and of blazars and frgs with lat/_fermi _ ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2009b ) indicate that luminous radio - loud agn host _ giant _ bhs , and that a prominent accretion disc co - exists with a powerful jet suggesting that extraction of rotational energy occurs through accretion ( maraschi 2001 ) . we are tempted to associate the extreme bh mass , inferred from the disc luminosity , to the stability of the bh spin orientation and the jet power to its spin modulus and to accretion in the retrograde mode .",
    "further studies on the _ stability _ of retrograde accretion will help in disentagling the nature on the agn radio  loud / quiet dichotomy .",
