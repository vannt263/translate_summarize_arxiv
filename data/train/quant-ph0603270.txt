    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite allows two parties ( alice and bob ) to generate a secret key despite the computational and technological power of an eavesdropper ( eve ) who interferes with the signals .",
    "this secret key is the essential ingredient of the one - time - pad or vernam cipher @xcite , which can provide information - theoretic secure communications .",
    "practical qkd protocols distinguish two phases in order to generate a secret key : a quantum phase and a classical phase . in the quantum phase a physical apparatus generates classical data for alice and bob distributed according to a joint probability distribution @xmath0 . in the classical phase ,",

    "the public discussion performed by alice and bob during the classical phase of qkd can involve either one - way or two - way classical communication .",
    "two - way classical communication is more robust than one - way in terms of the amount of errors that the qkd protocol can tolerate in order to distill a secret key @xcite .",
    "however , the first security proof of qkd by mayers @xcite , and the most commonly known proof by shor and presskill @xcite are based on one - way communications , and many other security proofs of qkd belong also to this last paradigm @xcite .",
    "moreover , any two - way communication protocol includes a final non - trivial step that is necessarily only one - way , so that the study of one - way communication is also useful for the study of two - way communication .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on one - way classical communication protocols during the public discussion phase .",
    "typically , these schemes consist of three steps : local pre - processing of the data , information reconciliation to correct the data , and privacy amplification to decouple the data from eve @xcite . depending on the allowed direction of communication ,",

    "we address the question of how much secret key can be obtained from the knowledge of @xmath1 and @xmath15 .",
    "this is one of the most important figures of merit in order to compare the performance of different qkd schemes .",

    "( see refs .",
    "we assume that the legitimate users have complete knowledge about their detection devices , which are fixed by the actual experiment .    in the last years , several lower and upper bounds on the secret key rate for particular one - way qkd schemes have been proposed .",
    "the lower bounds come from protocols that have been proven to be secure @xcite .",
    "the upper bounds are generally derived by considering some particular eavesdropping attack and by determining when this attack can defeat qkd @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , to evaluate these known bounds for general qkd protocols is not always a trivial task . typically , it demands to solve difficult optimization problems , which can be done only for some particular qkd protocols @xcite .",

    "( [ upperbound_ccq ] ) hard to evaluate .",
    "another upper bound that applies to the qkd scenario that we consider here is the csiszr and krner s secret key rate for the one - way _ classical _ key - agreement scenario @xcite .",
    "suppose that alice , bob , and eve have access to many independent realizations of three random variables @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath34 , respectively , that are distributed according to the joint probability distribution @xmath35 .",

    "the first channel produces the secret key @xmath40 , while the second channel creates the broadcasted information @xmath41 .",

    "the general idea followed here is similar to that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for two - way upper bounds on qkd .",
    "a quantum state @xmath2 is said to have a symmetric extension to two copies of system @xmath18 if and only if there exists a tripartite state @xmath62 with @xmath63 which fulfills the following two properties @xcite : @xmath64 where the operator @xmath65 satisfies @xmath66 .",
