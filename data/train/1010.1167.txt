    "among all quantum field theories in four spacetime dimensions , maximally supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory , in the t hooft limit of a large number of colors , is a most remarkable one .",
    "for one thing , it is the first and still only known example of an integrable theory in four spacetime dimensions .",
    "this integrability has been exploited successfully , so far , in the context of computing the spectrum of anomalous dimensions of the theory @xcite .",
    "this theory is also singled out as being the prototypical example of the ads / cft duality @xcite , which has produced many insights from strong coupling that have been instrumental in these developments .",
    "integrability structures arise in the study of scattering amplitudes . by `` integrability '' we mean an infinite dimensional symmetry algebra acts on amplitudes .",
    "most of these symmetries are hidden , non - local , symmetries that are not obvious from the usual presentation of the theory .",
    "the simplest example of such a symmetry can be seen from the expression of the one - loop correction to the four - point 1-loop amplitude .",
    "ignoring regularization for a moment , this can be written , for a color - ordered partial amplitude , as @xcite a_4^ = a_4^ ig^2n_c .",
    "besides being very compact , this expression exhibits a very remarkable symmetry .",
    "this becomes manifest when one introduces the so - called dual coordinates @xmath2 which are defined implicitly through p_i^=x_i^-x_i-1^ , in terms of which the integral becomes simply .",
    "the remarkable symmetry is the inversion @xmath3 , which sends @xmath4 : equivalently , the integrand is conformally invariant .",
    "this  dual conformal symmetry \" acts in momentum space and is therefore quite distinct from the familiar conformal symmetry of @xmath5 , whose arena is the original spacetime .    further evidence for this hidden symmetry accumulated in the course of higher - loop computations , where it was repeatedly found that all integrals appearing in loop corrections shared this property @xcite .",
    "of course , scattering amplitudes are infrared divergent , and regularization , for instance using dimensional regularization , will break the symmetry .",
    "so in the end most of the symmetry is broken at loop level .",
    "nevertheless , the breaking of the ( bosonic ) symmetry occurs in a very restricted and controlled fashion which leads to powerful constraints on the answer .",
    "specifically , the breaking is entirely captured by the so - called bern - dixon - smirnov ( bds ) ansatz @xcite . upon dividing by this ansatz ,",
    "any ( finite ) remainder is exactly conformal invariant @xcite . in particular",
    ", the bds ansatz provides the full all - loop answer for 4- and 5-points amplitudes , because nontrivial conformal invariants do not exist in these cases .    in parallel development alday and maldacena",
    "@xcite studied scattering amplitudes at strong coupling using ads / cft .",
    "they confirmed the bds ansatz at 4- and 5-points but observed deviations for sufficiently large number of particles @xcite ; deviations at 6 points were also deduced from investigation of regge limits @xcite .",
    "these violations are described by conformal invariant remainders , consistent with the symmetry analysis just mentioned .",
    "the strong coupling analysis led to a very geometrical understanding of the dual symmetry : a certain t - duality @xcite takes planar @xmath5 to itself , loosely speaking interchanging the dual coordinates and space - time coordinates .",
    "it converts a scattering process to the expectation value of a polygonal wilson loop with vertices at the points @xmath2 , m_n(p_1, ",
    ",p_n ) w_n(x_1, ",
    "successive segments of the polygonal contour have length @xmath6 ; we refer the reader to @xcite for an excellent review .",
    "the `` hidden '' symmetries of the scattering amplitudes have now become ordinary conformal transformations of this wilson loop .",
    "it makes sense to compute the same wilson loop at weak coupling .",
    "the result was found , by explicit computations , to agree with scattering amplitudes , but with a certain very specific set of helicity configurations , the so - called mhv amplitudes @xcite .",
    "this wilson loop / mhv amplitude duality has been confirmed up to two loops for the six - point function @xcite .    in parallel development , it was understood how dual ( super)conformal generators act on the polarization data that defines a scattering amplitude , allowing to define the symmetry away from the mhv limit .",
    "tree amplitudes in that case have been shown to be invariant under a full dual superconformal @xcite , while loops carry only a ( mildly broken ) dual conformal invariance @xcite .    a certain small piece had thus been missing for some time in order to bring this story to its full completion : a geometrical understanding of the symmetry for non - mhv amplitudes , similar to that afforded by the wilson loop in the mhv case .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to provide a super - wilson loop that fulfills just that purpose .",
    "a significant extension of the scope of the duality was proposed recently in @xcite .",
    "there it was proposed that the duality holds not only for final answers , but already for suitably defined integrands .",
    "the relevant `` integrands '' have been defined in two recent papers , in two very different contexts .    in the context of wilson loop computations , eden , korchemsky and",
    "sokatchev @xcite introduced a `` loop integrand '' by using the so - called method of lagrangian insertion . in this method ,",
    "loops are computed by taking repeated derivatives with respect to the coupling constant , which in sym brings down powers of the lagrangian density . at @xmath7 loops these are",
    "to be integrated over @xmath7 copies of space - time , the integrand being given as a tree - level correlation function of the wilson loop with @xmath7 lagrangian insertions . this way the computation of a wilson loop is turned into a set of @xmath8 integrals . by adding suitable total derivatives to the action density , a `` chiral '' lagrangian insertion involving @xmath9 instead of @xmath10 can be used , which was found in @xcite to be greatly convenient .",
    "independently , arkani - hamed and collaborators @xcite including the present author introduced a loop integrand in the context of scattering amplitude computations . at the simplest level",
    ", this `` integrand '' is just the familiar momentum - space one , obtained after summing over all feynman graphs and doing numerator algebra .",
    "normally , such an integrand is not quite well - defined , because loop momenta are only dummy integration variables : it is unclear how to add different feynman graphs under the same integration sign .",
    "one could always shift one diagram relative to the others .",
    "this ambiguity turns out to be absent in the planar limit , where region momenta @xmath2 can be used to canonically add diagrams .",
    "this way a gauge - invariant integrand is obtained .",
    "the work @xcite gave an efficient recursive procedure for computing it , starting from manifestly on - shell and physical tree amplitudes .",
    "the two integrands are known empirically to produce the same integrals , and it is therefore very natural to ask whether they are actually the same .",
    "both integrals are chiral ( non parity - invariant ) : in the first case due to a technical choice , in the second case due to one considering mhv amplitudes as opposed to its parity conjugate @xmath11 .",
    "thus they do not obviously disagree .",
    "remarkably , explicit comparison in @xcite has revealed that they precisely agree ! in this paper we aim to provide an explanation for this fact .",
    "the explanation will , in fact , lead directly to a wilson loop with polarizations , and to a general proof of the duality .",
    "our starting point is the singularities of the integrand defined by lagrangian insertions in @xcite .",
    "this is a rational function of the insertion point @xmath12 , with simple poles of the form @xmath13 where @xmath12 becomes null - separated from a corner of the wilson loop .",
    "these singularities can be understood at the operator level : a singular propagator knocks out one factor of @xmath14 from a lagrangian insertion , f^2 ~ _ _ f^(y ) + . here",
    "@xmath15 is some spinor associated with the separation @xmath16 that is becoming null .",
    "the resulting correlation function can be made gauge - invariant in a natural way , by adding two segments to the wilson loop joining @xmath2 to @xmath12 and back .",
    "thus the residue at the pole is a wilson loop with two more edges and @xmath14 inserted at a corner : . in the scattering amplitude context",
    ", exactly the same residue is interpreted as the forward limit of a nmhv tree amplitude with two particles added @xcite .",
    "thus wilson loops , with suitable insertions , know about the forward limit of nmhv tree amplitudes !    as we will see , the duality is not limited to forward limits : with suitable insertions along the contour , general nmhv tree amplitudes are also reproduced .",
    "furthermore , there is no reason to stop at nmhv level .",
    "we will define a super - wilson loop that knows about all n@xmath17mhv amplitudes , and agrees with all mhv - stripped super - amplitude @xmath18 where a_n m_n [ mhv ] .",
    "this new sweep of super - wilson loops depends on the same momentum and polarization data as scattering amplitudes do .",
    "importantly , within this enlarged sweep of objects , recursion relations become possible that relate objects with @xmath7 larangian insertions to other objects with fewer lagrangian insertions but more edges .",
    "these recursion relations will be seen to be identical to those found in @xcite , establishing that the two sweeps of objects are the same , to all loops , for arbitrary polarizations , at the integrand level .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : momtwist ] we introduce the coordinates that prove to be particularly well - suited for our description of scattering amplitudes , the so - called momentum twistor variables . in section [ sec : nmhv ] we begin the construction of the super - wilson loop through a process of `` reverse - engineering the answer . ''",
    "we complete the construction in section [ sec : wloop ] by requiring that the object be supersymmetric , in a certain specific sense .",
    "then in [ sec : example ] we give a simple example confirming that the super - wilson loop is indeed able to reproduce 1-loop nmhv amplitudes .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to establishing the recursion relations , at tree - level [ sec : tree ] and for loop integrands [ sec : loop ] .",
    "the paper ends with some conclusions , together with appendices that give more details about the wilson loop operator and various computations . in a final appendix we outline , based on physical arguments ,",
    "how divergences are expected to factorize within the lagrangian insertion procedure .",
    "there are many useful ways to describe tree amplitudes in @xmath5 sym .",
    "since we are interested in the dual wilson loop picture , we should employ those variables that make the symmetries of the wilson loop most manifest .",
    "incidentally , these variables are also the ones which produce the most compact analytic expressions : these are the momentum ( super-)twistor variables introduced by hodges @xcite .",
    "momentum twistors can be used in any planar theory with massless particles .",
    "their main achievement is to explicitly solve both the momentum conservation and mass - shell condition constraints , allowing for a constrain - free description of the external data .",
    "the constrains can be solved in two successive steps .",
    "the first step was already implicit in the introduction : one can trivialize momentum conservation in a planar theory by introducing variables @xmath2 such that p_i^= x_i^- x_i-1^. [ xspace ] planarity provides the required ordering of the particle labels . in the scattering amplitude picture the @xmath2 are called region momenta , while in the dual theory they are the positions of the corners of the wilson polygon .    to solve the mass - shell constraints",
    "@xmath19 we proceed to assign a `` momentum twistor '' to each particle .",
    "this is a four - component object z_i^ (    c _ i^ + _ i^    ) = (    c _",
    "i^ + x_i^_i^    ) . where the spinor @xmath20 is the one entering the standard decomposition @xmath21 , for @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath20 is defined only projectively and so is @xmath23 : @xmath23 and @xmath24 are to be identified , for any nonzero complex number @xmath25 .    the fact that this does solve the on - shell conditions will be explained shortly . as a first check one can count the degrees of freedom .",
    "we have @xmath26 momentum twistor components , subject to @xmath27 projective invariances and @xmath28 translation invariances for the @xmath2 , leaving @xmath29 degrees of freedom . the original scattering data , on the other hand , has @xmath26 variables subject to @xmath30 constraints , giving also @xmath29 degrees of freedom .",
    "thus all constraints have become symmetries .",
    "the inverse change of variable can be constructed explicitly @xcite : x_i^ = .",
    "the symbol @xmath31 is the standard antisymmetric 2-bracket , defined using the upper two components @xmath32 of @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( and more precisely defined in appendix ) .",
    "another useful equation is _",
    "i^ = , while the lorentz - invariant distance is simply ( x_i - x_k)^2= ii+1kk+1ii+1kk+1where @xmath35 is the totally antisymmetric contraction @xmath36 .    geometrically , the point @xmath2 in minkowski space is identified with the line @xmath37 in momentum twistor space , that passes through the points @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the condition that @xmath2 and @xmath40 be null separated is that @xmath41 .",
    "geometrically , this happens if and only if the lines @xmath37 and @xmath42 intersect .",
    "we can now see why the mass - shell conditions are solved : the lines @xmath43 and @xmath37 automatically intersect , the intersection being just the point @xmath38 .",
    "thus @xmath44 for any value of the momentum twistors .",
    "momentum twistors make conformal properties manifest , even though conformal invariance is not a prerequisite for their use .",
    "the conformal group in four dimensions is so(4,2 ) which is realized linearly on the momentum twistors .",
    "more precisely , momentum twistors transform in the spinor representation of ( the double - cover ) of so(4,2 ) .",
    "recall that we are describing the dual conformal transformations , which are those acting simply in the @xmath2 coordinates of the wilson loop and not to be confused with the ordinary conformal transformations ( acting on the original spacetime where the scattering process occurs ) .    because the antisymmetric tensor @xmath45 is invariant , any expression made out of 4-brackets is conformally invariant , while any 2-bracket breaks conformal invariance .    to describe @xmath5 polarization states",
    "one introduces the expansion for the on - shell states @xcite |i= |g^+_i+ _",

    "capitalized indices range from @xmath47 to @xmath28 and carry the su(4)@xmath48 r - symmetry charge , yielding two gluon helicities , four chiral fermions , four antichiral fermions and 6 scalars .    similarly to the @xmath2 coordinates , one can introduce grassman anticommuting coordinates @xmath49 such that @xmath50 .",
    "momentum super - twistors are then defined as ^= (    c _",
    "i^ + _ i^ + _",
    "i^a    ) = (    c _ i^ + x_i^_i^ + _ i^a _ i^    ) .",
    "the inverse map is [ etachange ] _",
    "similar to the @xmath2 , the @xmath49 trivialize super - momentum conservation @xmath51 , which is part of the supersymmetry algebra .",
    "a consequence is that @xmath52 and @xmath46 only make sense on the support of suitable super - momentum conserving delta functions .",
    "that is why , whenever one works with super - momentum twistors , one has to work with the mhv - stripped stripped amplitudes @xmath18 introduced above .",
    "dual conformal invariance of the tree - level scattering amplitudes in @xmath5 amounts to @xmath18 being expressible , using @xmath38 and @xmath53 variables , using only four - brackets .",
    "the ( super ) momentum twistors make tree amplitudes extremely well localized in the coordinates @xmath2 ; this is the coordinate space of wilson loop and so this is particularly relevant for us . for instance , consider the nmhv super - amplitude .",
    "it admits the very compact form @xcite .",
    "1 < i < j < n-1 [ 1ii+1jj+1 ] [ nmhv ] where the square bracket is the ubiquitous supersymmetry invariant ( yangian invariant ) [ abcde ] = .    with simple choices of @xmath54",
    "the same expression gives nmhv tree amplitudes in pure yang - mills theory .",
    "the amplitudes with such values of @xmath55 are nontrivial linear combinations of those with prescribed @xmath46 values , and the conversion between @xmath46- and @xmath55- amplitudes requires full @xmath5 amplitudes . in that sense",
    "the duality under consideration requires the full @xmath5 supersymmetry : it is those amplitudes with prescribed @xmath46 that will appear on the wilson loop side .",
    "to see how @xmath46-components localize along the wilson loop consider for instance the component proportional to @xmath56 in the scattering amplitude .",
    "it comes from only one term indices on the variables @xmath57 .",
    "whenever we write a product of four @xmath46 s , it is understood that all @xmath46 s have different @xmath58-charge . here , for instance , we could be extracting the component @xmath59 .",
    "] , [ 123kk+1 ] _ 1_2_k_k+1 .",
    "manifestly , this is completely localized to the corners @xmath60 and @xmath61 of the wilson loop : by inserting scalar field operators at corners of the wilson loop _ i^a_i+1^b and connecting two corners with a scalar propagator this will be reproduced = _ 1_2_k_k+1 . .",
    "this completely fixes the dependence of a putative super - wilson loop on the product @xmath62 , if the tree nmhv amplitude is to be reproduced .",
    "any other dependence on @xmath62 could not reproduce this simple result .",
    "other simple lessons gathered from the nmhv formula are that no dependence can occur on products such as @xmath63 ( because this would generate terms not in ( [ nmhv ] ) ) , and that any operator inserted on the edge @xmath64 can depend only on the single momentum twistor @xmath53 .    to find out what these edge insertions are for scalar field components , consider the component @xmath65 of the super - amplitude [ 123kk+1 ] ~_2 ^ 2_k_k+1 .",
    "[ inducedphi ] according to the above analysis we must reproduce this using a propagator linking the corner @xmath66 to the edge @xmath67 , or its endpoints . a natural ansatz for the edge operator on segment 2 , which will be motivated shortly , is 14 _ 0 ^ 1 dt _ 2^a_2^b .",
    "the derivative is required to match with the dimensionality of the corner term and its form will be explained in a moment . for the moment",
    "this ansatz contains an undetermined spinor @xmath68 . to determine it we compute the partial amplitude",
    "@xmath65 it produces : 12_0 ^ 1 dt = .",
    "this conformal properties of this expression are not obvious . to make such properties manifest we rewrite the right - hand side using momentum twistor variables : where the square bracket means cyclic sum .",
    "it now becomes apparent that the choice @xmath69 produces almost the right answer : = + , where we have used the schouten identity .",
    "the remainder is localized on the corner @xmath70 , and can be dealt with by a suitable corner term .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "first , the integral has produced a rational function of the external data ( e.g. , there is no logarithm ) .",
    "this is surprising because integration often produces logarithms . here",
    "this can be traced to the chiral derivative acting on @xmath71 .",
    "in fact , a rational answer will only be obtained for derivatives of the form @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",
    "investigation of the latter case reveals that it is incapable of producing the correct nmhv answer , leaving the above ansatz as the only possibility .",
    "therefore what we have found so far is that the coupling of the wilson loop to scalar fields can be uniquely determined by `` reverse - engineering '' the nmhv formula : _ i 14 _ 0 ^ 1 dt _",
    "i^a_i^b + _",
    "ab(x_i ) ( _ i+1^b - 12 ) .",
    "it is clear that by considering more and more polarizations we could continue with this `` reverse - engineering '' process and determine couplings to fermions and gauge boson .",
    "the tree - level nmhv analysis , however , will always be determined by free - theory two - point functions and is incapable of constraining non - linear couplings . to fully determine the super wison - loop this way",
    ", we would have to consider n@xmath74mhv tree amplitudes , or nmhv loop amplitudes , and so on .",
    "fortunately there is a better way to proceed .",
    "tree - level scattering amplitudes are known to be invariant under dual super - conformal transformations .",
    "they are in fact invariant under a whole yangian algebra , but here we should focus only on those symmetries which the wilson loop formulation is expected to make manifest .",
    "these contain the poincar supersymmetries @xmath75 of the wilson loop which are expected to match certain elements of the su(4@xmath764 ) supersymmetries acting on momentum twistors .",
    "specifically , the expected correspondence is obtained by matching the quantum numbers : q_a^ & & _ i _ i^ = _ i , + q^a & & _ i _ i^a = _ i _ i^a .",
    "( notice that the r - charges carried by elementary fields are opposite in the t - dual theory . )",
    "the theory is also invariant under super - conformal generators @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which will be discussed below .",
    "it is useful to note that @xmath79 does not actually act on the original space - time scattering data : from that viewpoint @xmath79 is simply a redundancy in the @xmath52 variables , much like translation invariance of the @xmath2 .",
    "thus the super - wilson loop has better be invariant under these transformations .",
    "however , contrary to translation symmetry , the bosonic part @xmath80 is not trivially invariant under @xmath79 : this invariance is a very nontrivial constraint .    to proceed we write the general couplings in the form w_n [ wloop ] where the @xmath81 are edge operators and the @xmath82 are vertex operators . in line with the above analysis , we will impose that @xmath83 depends only on @xmath53 , and that @xmath82 depend only on @xmath53 and @xmath84 .",
    "ultimately this is justified by the fact that a solution will be found with these constraints .",
    "the edge operator begins with the gauge connection @xmath85 .",
    "the variation of this term is nonzero , as said above , @xmath86 .",
    "this forces us to add a fermion term such that @xmath87 : _ i = -p_ia + 12c_0 _ i _ a^ _ i^a +  this is unique if we assume that @xmath88 depends only on @xmath53 .",
    "the procedure is systematic and by repeating it one obtains terms of higher and higher order in @xmath46 . with some algebra",
    "we find 2_i & = & -_i _ i a + 1c_0 _ i _ a _",
    "i^a + 12c_0 ^ 2 _ i^a_i^b & & - _ abcd _ i^b_i^c _",
    "i^d - _ abcd_i^a_i^b_i^c_i^d , [ edge ] together with the vertex terms _",
    "ii+1 = 1 + ( _ i+1^a_i^b - 12 _ i^a_i^b ) +  the somewhat lengthy expression for the vertex term is reported in appendix .",
    "the overall factor of @xmath89 in the edge term is just from @xmath90 : for simplicity all terms are written as spinor products . in each term",
    "there is a unique way to contract the indices , taken conventionally to be with a lower spinor index on the left and upper index on the right .",
    "the constant @xmath91 has appeared because the two supersymmetries act on different superspaces : it is not _ a - priori _ obvious how to normalize one compared to the other .",
    "the correct value can be obtained by matching with the nmhv tree amplitude . with careful normalization ( which was omitted in the previous section )",
    "we find c_0=()^1/4 .",
    "[ defc0 ]    our construction and verification that the wilson loop is invariant under the claimed @xmath92 supersymmetry has proceeded by brute force application of the supersymmetry generators given in appendix .",
    "more precisely , the edges transform by total derivatives , which are cancelled by vertex variations . the precise form of the total derivative is given in appendix .",
    "it is also important to use the equations of motion .",
    "what about other symmetries ?",
    "consider the generator @xmath93 .",
    "it is easy to compute the lowest term in the edge variation : ( s_a^ + c_0 _",
    "i^ ) ( -_i _ i a + 1c_0 _ i _ a _ i^a +",
    " ) = -(_i x^ ) _ i _ a - ^ _ i _ a +  = 0 + ( ) .",
    "thus the lowest term of the variation vanishes ; here we have used the definition of @xmath94 . since the higher - order terms in @xmath46 are obtained by repeated action of @xmath79 , and since @xmath79 and @xmath93 commute , this can be used to show that the full operator is invariant .",
    "more precisely , @xmath95 is annihilated by @xmath79 , vanishes in lowest degree , and depends on edge @xmath96 only through @xmath53 .",
    "but there is no such thing , so @xmath97 to all orders in @xmath46 .",
    "the same argument shows that the operator is ( formally ) conformal invariant .",
    "in fact there is nothing to compute , since we already know that the wilson loop is conformal invariant to order @xmath98 .",
    "so @xmath99 vanishes in lowest component , is annihilated by @xmath100 ( using that @xmath101\\propto \\tilde s_a$ ] and that @xmath93 is already known to be a symmetry ) , and depends on edge @xmath96 only through @xmath53 : this implies @xmath102 .",
    "we say `` formally '' because , contrary to @xmath79 and @xmath93 , @xmath103 contains bosonic derivative which make it more singular at short distances .",
    "indeed it is well - known that @xmath103 becomes anomalous at loop level @xcite ; @xmath79 and",
    "@xmath93 do not become anomalous , however .",
    "finally , one might ask whether the operator is well defined , given that it contains null - separated fields .",
    "it appears that built - in cancellation mechanisms prevent ill - defined contractions of null - separated fields from occurring in it .",
    "for instance , the scalar field component @xmath104 proportional to @xmath105 that is induced from edge 2 and vertex 2 , as seen from ( [ inducedphi ] ) , vanishes when @xmath71 becomes null - separated from the endpoints of edge 2 .",
    "thus no singular contraction involving this component of the is possible . in other cases",
    "supersymmetric cancellations can be seen .",
    "indeed a formal argument based on supersymmetry can be given to argue the absence of problematic contractions : by using 12 of the supercharges @xmath106 to set three adjacent @xmath107 to zero , any potential power - divergent contraction between the two vertices will be prevented .",
    "now of course one could do this anywhere around the loop , suggesting no such contraction occurs anywhere .",
    "another line of argument is that the operator is essentially generated by repeated action of @xmath79 on the bosonic wilson loop : since one never worries about the power - divergent contractions of @xmath108 ( only about logarithimc divergent contributions at loop level ) , this leaves little reason to worry about such contractions for the super - extension of the operator . for these reasons we will discuss such issues any longer .    in summary",
    ", we have defined a super - wilson loop operator that is manifestly invariant under @xmath92 and @xmath78 and is also formally conformal invariant .",
    "its scalar component agrees with that obtained in the preceding subsection .",
    "it is not invariant under the remaining supersymmetries , as will be discussed below .      in a remarkable recent paper , which appeared while this manuscript was being prepared , mason and skinner",
    "@xcite introduced a wilson loop in momentum twistor space , whose expectation value they argued ( using mhv rules in momentum twistor space @xcite ) reproduces all - loop scattering amplitudes in @xmath5 sym .",
    "the twistor transform of this operator , which they also discussed , gives a wilson loop in the same four - dimensional space - time as the wilson loop we are considering .",
    "this space - time wilson loop they expressed as the integral over a super - connection , = where & & ( a + _ a ^a + 12 d_ab^a^b - 16 _ abcd d^a^b^c^d + 124_abcd df ^a^b^c^d +  ) & & + d^a ( -12_ab^b + 13_abcd ^b^c^d + 16 _ abcd f ^b^c^d +  ) . [ supercon ] reference @xcite explained the general method for constructing this operator and gave also explicit expressions up to scalar components .",
    "here we wrote down a few extra higher - order terms by `` guessing '' .",
    "( in each term shown there is a unique way to contract the indices .",
    "the notation is the same as above . )",
    "we believe that the shown terms are still not complete , though , since we also find that , if the object is to transform by super - gauge transformations under supersymmetry , it should contain other non - linear terms such as @xmath109 .",
    "the full operator thus presumably contains term going all the way up to order @xmath110",

    "the first term is precisely our edge term while and the total derivative gives exactly our vertex term !",
    "we have also checked other scalar components .",
    "the agreement is even more striking for products like @xmath62 , which are pure vertex terms for us but which appear in mason and skinner s edges as pure total derivatives . given the role played by supersymmetry in both constructions , we expect complete agreement for the other terms as well .",
    "a second minor difference is that the connection in @xcite contains no factors of the coupling .",

    "the same expectation is now written e^ _ y _ ^4 [ ] . where _",
    "^4= 12 ^2- 14 ! ^4 .",
    "the reason for writing the kinetic term in this particular fashion will become clear shortly .",
    "the answer being the same as above we must still be able to compute loops by taking derivatives with respect to the coupling .",
    "but now one also gets terms from the explicit dependence on @xmath15 of the operator , as well as from the kinetic term in the lagrangian .",
    "the equivalence with ( [ defperturb ] ) would appear to be lost .",
    "consider for instance the first derivative of the two - point function ( properly normalized so that the tree - level contribution is of order @xmath130 ) : = - - id^4y .",
    "for a one - loop computation this is to be evaluated to order @xmath130 .",
    "now the first term would appear to be of order @xmath170 , however , the second term contains contact terms since @xmath171 .",
    "these two sorts of terms are easily seen to exactly cancel each other .",
    "furthermore , this use of the equations of motion flip the sign of the potential term , recovering precise agreement with the 1-loop term in ( [ defperturb ] ) .",
    "the same works at higher - loops . derivatives of the explicit @xmath172 factors from previous lagrangian insertions get cancelled by contact terms where multiple lagrangian insertions go on top of each other .",
    "the moral is that , in this theory , by writing the kinetic term in the appropriate fashion it is possible to cancel contact terms against explicit coupling constant factors .",
    "then it is correct to freely use the equations of motion inside the lagrangian insertions .",

    "we insist , however , that the form ( [ insertion ] ) is essentially forced upon us by the coupling constant dependence of the super wilson loop .",

    "this being said , it appears very likely that the integrand defined by lagrangian insertion is a rational function in general . in what follows",
    "we will assume that this is the case , which will be justified _ a posteriori _ by the remarkable self - consistency of the emerging picture .",
    "so we let the integrand be a rational function of the insertion points and external data .",
    "then we can continue using the bcfw deformation technology we used at tree - level to determine it .",

    "these `` single - cut '' terms were in fact our motivation for defining a super - wilson loop , so that it could reproduce those terms .",

    "need not agree , because natural regularization schemes on the two sides of the correspondence are different . to finish the proof of the correspondence , it is important to make sure that the logarithm of the amplitude ( the relevant quantity ) has a well - controlled scheme dependence . a general argument for this",
    "is presented in appendix .",
    "we have constructed , directly from field theory , a family of supersymmetric wilson loop operators in @xmath5 yang - mills theory .",
    "this family depends on the same momentum and polarization data as scattering amplitudes do . by analyzing the factorization properties of this object in various channels at zeroth order in the coupling ,",
    "we have derived recursion relations for it .",
    "these recursions are the same as those obeyed by tree - level scattering amplitudes , showing that the two objects are the same .",
    "furthermore , similar recursion relations extend to appropriately defined `` loop integrands '' which can be defined on each side .",
    "the duality between the two objects thus extends to all loops , already at the level of integrands .",
    "the super - wilson loop sheds some light on the nature of the duality .",
    "understanding this at tree level is already nontrivial and interesting , since we have seen that in a sense loops are made by sewing trees . in the wilson - loop side",
    "it turns out that only the self - dual sector contributes to tree amplitudes ( this is especially clear in the chalmers - siegel form ( [ chalmersiegel ] ) and even more so in the work @xcite ) .",
    "this immediately makes a striking prediction on the scattering amplitude side : _ there must be a subsector of @xmath5 sym that is sufficient to compute all tree amplitudes .",
    "_ this sector is certainly not directly the self - dual sector , because the asymptotic fields of negative helicity gluons are not self - dual by definition .",
    "however it should be somehow close to the self - dual sector .",
    "the amount of its non - self - duality is presumably related , through the t - duality , to the non - self - duality of the fields on the support of the wilson loop .",
    "so at this stage it is not clear what the subsector is , and what its relation to self - dual @xmath5 is , but it might be productive to understand this issue .",
    "it is important to note that we have not computed completely the form of the wilson loop operator : we have computed only those components that we needed , dropping certain nonlinear terms containing with 5 or more powers of @xmath52 at the corners .",
    "most of our results regarding factorization and recursion relations assumed little more than the existence of a supersymmetry - covariant wilson loop , and supersymmetry always allowed us to make do without these terms .",
    "nevertheless , since to our knowledge such a superconnection has never be written down in complete detail , we feel that it would be good to see it worked out fully somewhere .    on a technical side ,",
    "the examples that we have worked out have the unsatisfactory feature that conformal invariance is not manifest at all intermediate steps .",
    "the six - dimensional formalism for four - dimensional conformal field theories , presented recently by weinberg @xcite , might be very useful in that respect .",
    "especially when combined with momentum twistors , which are in the spinor representation of so(4,2 ) and allow for particularly compact expressions for chiral conformal invariants , this should provide a particularly efficient formalism .",
    "another question on which the super - wilson loop sheds some light is the longstanding observation that tree amplitudes are invariant under a full yangian symmetry , while loop amplitudes ( even those which are finite ) do not exhibit it @xcite . in particular , half the dual supersymmetries @xmath205",
    "are preserved to all loops , while the other half @xmath206 is broken starting from 1-loop .",
    "this has been understood as a holomorphic anomaly in @xcite .",
    "the wilson loop defined here and in @xcite makes the unbroken half of the supersymmetry fully manifest but explicitly breaks the other half , as discussed in section ( [ sec : betterhalf ] ) , the wilson loop , constructed from various other requirements , turns out to violate explicitly these symmetries but by an amount explicitly proportional to @xmath207 .",
    "thus the empirical observation of @xcite are built - in into the operator . the symmetry enhancement that occurs at tree - level",
    "must clearly be related to the self - dual sector , although precisely how is not completely clear yet .",
    "the explicit breaking suggests a novel way of computing what has appeared as an `` anomaly '' before .",
    "indeed , we have found that the variation is given by ( [ anomaly ] ) ^a w_n = dx _ , where the ( color - adjoint ) parenthesis is to be inserted along the wilson loop ; a similar expression holds for the superconformal generators @xmath181 . as just remarked , the right - hand side is manifestly of order @xmath207 .",
    "furthermore , at any loop order , the right - hand side can have at most single - logarithmic divergences .",
    "in fact , it appears very likely that these divergences are concentrated to the corners of the @xmath208 integral , so that the correlation function itself is finite to any loop order .",
    "if this formula is correct , it might prove a particularly powerful way of computing derivatives of the logarithm of mhv amplitudes at higher - loop levels ; these derivatives , and the full answer , are known to exhibit remarkable simplicity and structure @xcite .",

    "we can use this to do perform the fermion integrals , d^4_a d^4_b ^0|4(_b + _ 2_a ) = bn-1n1 ^ 2 .",
    "the @xmath246 integral is to be done on a small circle around the special value where @xmath247 .",
    "now all we got so far near this point is a double zero .",
    "however some terms in the wilson loop ( [ edgea ] ) contain denominators @xmath248 , which produce poles .",
    "the terms in the wilson loop contain at most three such powers , which is exactly what we need to obtain a finite residue .",
    "thus we need only keep those terms with three powers of @xmath249 .",
    "these are ( -12 _ 0 ^ 1 dt _ _ _ _ df(y + t p ) + _ _ f(y+p ) ) .",
    "the edge integral in the parenthesis is a total derivative , which cancels precisely against the vertex term at one endpoint .",
    "there remains only the other endpoint , located at @xmath12 .",
    "finally the contour integral can be expressed as _ _",
    "this agrees precisely with ( [ bcfwcut ] ) , as anticipated in the main text .",
    "more precisely , this equality has been derived for @xmath188 . however , both the correlation function with lagrangian insertions and the expression ( [ good_forward_limita ] ) are manifestly invariant under @xmath106 supersymmetries .",
    "thus it follows that they agree for all values of the @xmath46 .",
    "several natural regulators are possible for the wilson loop :    * dimensional regularization to @xmath250 dimensions .",
    "* dimensional regularization of the measure in the lagrangian insertion procedure , keeping the integrand in four dimensions @xcite . * multiplication of the lagrangion insertion integrand by @xmath251 ( similar to adding masses in the higgs - inspired scheme of @xcite )",
    ".        none of these regulators will produce the same answer .",
    "the last two differ in whether masses are kept in numerators . here",
    "we would like to argue that the logarithm of the wilson loop , which is the relevant physical quantity , can only differ from one approach to the other in a very mild and controlled way .",
    "more precisely , the logarithm of the wilson loop takes the form ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) w_n= _ i ( _ ^2 + d + c ) + .",
    "in the scattering amplitude side this form follows from factorization theorems in the planar limit .",
    "it is completely expected , and verified in practice ( to four loops in @xcite ) , that different regulators only affect the scheme dependent constants @xmath253 and @xmath254 but the `` finite part '' is unchanged .",
    "this is part of the physical content of factorization .",
    "the modest point we would like to make in this appendix is that factorization is made particularly explicit by the lagrangian insertion procedure .",
    "first we observe that all the above regulators are compatible with the lagrangian procedure ( in fact , some are only defined within it ) .",
    "so , we can use it in our analysis .",
    "the main observation then is that in this procedure the logarithm can be taken already at the level of the integrand .",
    "that is , for instance , at two - loops , one can consider the integral w_n= _",
    "y_1,y_2 ( m^_n(y_1,y_2 ) - 12 m^_n(y_1 ) m^(y_2 ) ) .",
    "the claim is that the parenthesis is much better behaved then each term in it object , with divergent regions with @xmath255 and @xmath256 not close canceling explicitly .",
    "this can be easily verified at two - loop using the well - known two - loop integrand for four particles @xcite .",
    "more generally , we would like to argue that divergences in the logarithmic occur only from the regions where all particles collectively approach the same singular region .",
    "in other words , that factorization occurs already at the integrand level .",
    "the mechanism we suggest is very simple : lagrangian insertions are color singlet operators .",
    "imagine that , at @xmath7 loops , a subgroup of lagrangian insertions approaches a singular region .",
    "there is a scaling parameter @xmath257 , for instance near a hard collinear singular region , @xmath258 , which we can introduce to make all these insertions approach the hard collinear region at the same rate .",
    "similar scaling variables can be introduced to deal with the soft wide - angle and soft - collinear regions . in the scaling limit",
    "we have a number of color - singlet operators inserted very close to an edge , plus other `` passive '' insertions at some other fixed locations .",
    "we know from general power - counting that the singularity in this limit will be at most logarithmic : the correlation function times the measure factor can not not blow up in the limit",
    ". the only terms which survive thus behave like dimension-0 color - single corrections to the edge operator , as seen from the passive insertions . but",
    "such a correction can only be proportional to the edge itself .",
    "that is the field induced by the edge region is not affected , in the scaling limit , by the presence of the insertions .",
    "this implies the factorization of the integrand in this limit into a product of two correlation functions , one involving the singular subgroup , and one involving the passive subgroup .",
    "since such products are killed by the logarithm , we conclude that the integrand for the logarithm of the @xmath167 is regular whenever a proper subgroup of insertions approaches a singular region . as a corollary ,",
    "if we take the scaling limit as all lagrangian insertions approach a singular region , and strip off a collective @xmath259 , the integral over the relative coordinates must be finite .",
    "this integrand multiplies the zeroth order expectation value of the wilson loop .",
    "since the mechanism is the color neutrality of the lagrangian insertion , it applies in @xmath260 dimensions as well and thus implies the equality of the first three regulators listed above , up to the finite `` constants under the logarithm '' .",
    "( the scaling limit in the soft directions , under which soft singularities factorize independently , is multiplicative .",
    "thus the integral over relative rapidities , of the integrand for hard collinear divergences , is guaranteed to be finite . )    a definite prediction of this argument is that there should exist a finite @xmath261-dimensional integral which gives the cusp anomalous dimension to @xmath7 loops .",
    "its integrand is the connected correlation function of @xmath7 lagrangian insertions in the universal background field very close to a segment of the wilson loop , that is sourced by this segment and the two cusps at its endpoints .",

    "<S> we show that this object is determined by a host of recursion relations , which are valid at tree level and at loop level for a certain  loop integrand \" defined within the lagrangian insertion procedure . </S>",
    "<S> these recursion relations reproduce the bcfw ones obeyed by tree - level scattering amplitudes , as well as their extension to loop integrands which appeared recently in the literature , establishing the duality to all orders in perturbation theory . finally , we propose that a certain set of finite correlation functions can be used to compute all first derivatives of the logarithm of mhv amplitudes .    </S>",
