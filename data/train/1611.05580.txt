    "fast radio bursts ( frbs ) represent a new phenomenological class of astrophysical transient .",
    "they are bright ( @xmath6jy peak flux density ) pulses of radio emission that show the effects of propagating though large column densities of plasma : dispersion through ionized plasma , multipath propagation due to inhomogeneities in the plasma @xcite , and faraday rotation due to magnetization of the plasma @xcite .",
    "the column densities exceed predictions for the galaxy , suggesting that the frbs are extragalactic and possibly cosmological in origin @xcite .",
    "they have hitherto only been detected using single - dish telescopes , which have poor angular resolution .",
    "only one frb has been found to repeat @xcite , greatly enhancing prospects for its localization in follow - up observations .",
    "for the remaning frbs , which have not repeated , attempts at localization have relied on detecting counterpart multi - wavelength transients that might be expected if the frbs arise from cataclysmic explosions or outbursts .",
    "a claimed association of frb  150418 with a centimeter - wavelength afterglow and host galaxy @xcite has been disputed and instead attributed to common agn variability , either intrinsic @xcite , or caused by milky way scintillation @xcite . with so little detail on the locations of frbs , theories for their production and sources are understandably varied , ranging from ultabright pulses from pulsars @xcite , to cosmic strings @xcite .",

    "we report on a centimeter - wavelength radio monitoring campaign of the parkes localization region of frb  131104 , and the discovery of an unusual , variable radio source ( at  j0642.9@xmath115118 ) that flares coincident in time and location with frb  131104 . at  j0642.9@xmath115118 is not coincident with swift j0644.5@xmath115111 ; indeed , our observations exclude any bright radio afterglow of swift j0644.5@xmath115111 . in section [ sec : radioobs ] , we present radio observations of the field and the light curve of at  j0642.9@xmath115118 . in section [ sec : opticalobs ] , we present an optical characterization of at  j0642.9@xmath115118 .",

    "its position at the edge of the bat field of view , illuminating only 2.9% of detectors , resulted in a @xmath16 detection in the image plane despite its high fluence of @xmath17erg@xmath18 . assuming a distance of 3.2gpc for frb  131104 based on comparing its extragalactic dm with models for the ionized content of the universe , the isotropic energy output of swift j0644.5@xmath115111 was @xmath15erg , with a duration of @xmath14s .",
    "this is somewhat longer , and somewhat less energetic than most long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) detected by _ swift _",
    "@xcite , but is inconsistent with other grb subtypes ( e.g. , ultra - long grbs ) .",
    "@xcite consider it likely that , largely independent of the source model , a radio afterglow would have been present .",
    "we constrain such an afterglow in section  5.2 using our observations .",

    "this corresponds to an odds ratio of between @xmath19 600:1 and 1800:1 . following an argument made by @xcite",
    ", we compare this odds ratio with the expected number of frbs that exhibit similar counterparts , which we can estimate by comparing the detection rate of events such as swift j0644.5@xmath115111 with the frb rate .",
    "there is an inconsistency between the inferred all - sky @xmath0-ray pulse rate and the frb rate , as noted by @xcite , that also calls into question the association .",
    "if swift j0644.5@xmath115111 had occurred in the region of the bat field of view with @xmath20 coding , it would have resulted in an image - based burst trigger .",
    "@xcite estimate that the rate of long - duration image - triggered events , presumably similar to swift j0644.5@xmath115111 , is 25yr@xmath21 .",

    ", we predict that bat should have been sensitive to the counterparts of between @xmath24 and @xmath25 frbs in a year .",
    "we calculate this using the fluence - complete frb rate of 2500sky@xmath21day@xmath21 events with fluences @xmath26jyms @xcite , and assume both that the frb source counts are consistent with a euclidean universe , and that swift obtains a @xmath27 observing duty cycle .",
    "thus , the odds ratio of @xcite observing their counterpart is the ratio of the @xmath0-ray event rate to the radio event rate .",

    "therefore , the odds ratio of frb  131104 having a @xmath0-ray counterpart ( based on the disparity of the @xmath0-ray pulse and frb rates ) , and the odds ratio of swift j0644.5@xmath115111 being associated with frb  131104 ( the calculation presented in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are comparable .",
    "this demonstrates that a true association is not significantly more likely than the probability of an unassociated occurrence .",
    "this issue was qualitatively acknowledged by @xcite . to reconcile",
    "the event rates would require frb  131104 to be of a fundamentally different , much rarer class than the other frbs .",
    "furthermore , the false alarm probabilities of such unassociated occurrences given by @xcite are likely underestimated .",
    "the calculations relied on estimating the background rate of @xmath16 image - plane detections , when lower - significance detections may still have exceeded their final false - alarm probability threshold of @xmath28 .",
    "their background rate was also only calculated for events with 200s to 400s durations , whereas they may still have claimed a counterpart discovery with either a shorter or longer event coincident with frb  131104 .",
    "the false alarm rate for all the possible associations that @xcite could have claimed is hence likely higher than was estimated .",

    "a @xmath30-pointing mosaic was necessary to cover to twice the half - power beam point of parkes observations ( which is the first null in the primary beam ) at the highest frequency of the atca observations .",
    "this was especially crucial because of the possibility of a population of ultrabright frbs that could be detected in the outer main beam or sidelobe of the telescope @xcite .",

    "the lower spatial resolution observations suffered from higher noise , but other problems such as source confusion were not a problem because the field is relatively sparse .",
    "data were bandpass calibrated using observations of either pks  0823@xmath11500 or pks  1934@xmath11638 , and flux calibrated using the latter .",

    "we reduced the data using the standard gmos pipeline , with a bias observation obtained on mjd  57363 , and flat - field observations taken in between our science exposures .    unfortunately , intermittent high cirrus was present , precluding accurate spectrophotometric calibration and making sky emission lines difficult to subtract .",
    "we nonetheless used observations of a spectrophotometric calibrator on mjd  57562 ( ltt  3218 ) to calibrate telluric absorption features .",
    "as the seeing on both nights was @xmath68  fwhm , as measured from acquisition images , we could not deconvolve the spectral traces of g1 and g2 . furthermore",
    ", some light from g1 was likely refracted out of the slit as gmos does not contain an atmospheric dispersion corrector .",
    "hence , following optimal extraction of the spectra , we only considered data taken using the r400 grating at wavelengths shorter than 9250  and divided the data by a smooth polynomial fit to the continuum . the resulting spectrum , which contains numerous artifacts due to imperfect sky subtraction and is binned to 8  resolution , is shown in fig .  [ fig : optical_image ] .",
    "we tentatively identify two redshifted systems in this spectrum : one at @xmath69 and one at @xmath70 .",
    "the first system is consistent with the spectra of early - type galaxies @xcite , a hypothesis which is additionally evidenced by a possible spectral break in the continuum around 4000 .",
    "we thus interpret it as corresponding to g2 .",
    "the redshift of the second system , presumably g1 ( the radio source ) , is estimated primarily using the strong emission line at 7040  and by assuming ( based on the wise and blue optical colors ) that it is an agn . identifying the 7040  line with [ oii]3272  results in a clear prediction , specifically that strong emission lines ( e.g. , ly@xmath66 , civ , mgii ) should be seen at shorter wavelengths .",
    "it appears to exhibit h@xmath0 and h@xmath71 in absorption .",
    "the lack of these normally broad lines in emission , combined with the compact nature of its radio counterpart evidenced by the variability , is suggestive of a narrow - line radio galaxy @xcite , or perhaps a radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 @xcite .",
    "more sensitive spectra with broader wavelength coverage would help in this classification , for example by searching for the feii emission features that distinguish the narrow - line seyfert 1 class .",
    "our observations can be used to search for afterglow emission associated with the potential @xmath0-ray transient swift j0644.5@xmath115111 . in the classic fireball model @xcite",
    ", the flux density of radio synchrotron emission is directly related to the input energy .",
    "@xcite calculated the flux density assuming the spectrum is not self absorbed and that the frequency of interest is below the peak of the spectrum so that the flux density is still rising .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for our observations within @xmath72 and @xmath3  d after the frb . assuming a distance @xmath73  gpc consistent with the pulses extragalactic dispersion measure , after time @xmath74  d at a frequency @xmath75  ghz , the flux density is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the energy emitted in @xmath0-rays",

    ", we could have detected the source in both the @xmath5  ghz and @xmath29  ghz observations @xmath3  d after the explosion , with a significance of @xmath83 .",
    "this suggests that either the input luminosity is smaller than estimated in @xcite , that the environment surrounding the burst is unlike that of long @xmath0-ray bursts or core - collapse supernova explosions , or that the @xmath0-ray transient is unrelated to the frb or spurious .",
    "we interpret the variable radio source at  j0642.9@xmath115118 as emission from compact components in a radio - loud agn .",
    "this is evidenced by the persistent radio variability on timescales of days to months , the optical to mid - infrared colors of its host system , and its possible spectral identification .",
    "the lightcurve of the flare following frb  131104 , with the spectrum inverting when it brightens , is consistent with the classic picture of an expanding and cooling synchrotron bubble .",
    "although the flare lightcurve is consistent with the radio afterglows of relativistic transients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the persistence and low - level variability of the radio source beyond the flare means that we have no evidence to favor a transient coinciding with a variable radio source , over simply a variable radio source .    at  j0642.9@xmath115118",
    "is nonetheless interesting .",
    "this object has substantial differences from the variable radio source identified with frb  150418 @xcite .",
    "first , we clearly identify the flare of at  j0642.9@xmath115118 with the days immediately after the frb , as we observe the flux density rise and the spectrum invert .",
    "additionally , scintillation in the milky way interstellar medium is less likely to cause the variability of at  j0642.9@xmath115118 because the source is at a relatively high galactic latitude ( @xmath84 ) , and the scattering is expected to be in the weak regime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 7.5  ghz .",
    "it is possible that the source was magnified by an extreme scattering event @xcite , but that is improbable as only one in @xmath85 compact sources are undergoing one at a given time . perhaps most importantly , at  j0642.9@xmath115118 has not re - brightened to within a factor of two of its flux densities as the peak of the flare , unlike the case for frb  150418 @xcite .",
    "the flare of at  j0642.9@xmath115118 following frb  131104 thus appears to be a transient occurrence within the scope of our monitoring of its flux density .",
    "blind surveys for transients at lower frequencies find objects with such extreme variability ( factor of three on few - month timescales ) only very rarely ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is not surprising . assuming constant brightness temperature , intrinsic agn variability timescales scale with frequency proportional to @xmath86 .",
    "transient agn flare events at higher frequencies are hence generally expected to be shorter in time , and are often also larger in modulation , than at lower frequencies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "scintillation timescales in the strong scintillation regime are expected to be more rapid .",
    "the post - frb flare of at  j0642.9@xmath115118 is clearly most dramatic at the highest observing frequency .",
    "the temporal coincidence of at  j0642.9@xmath115118 flare with frb  131104 nonetheless motivates us to consider the possibility that it is associated with the frb . in this case ,",
    "agn activity would be implicated in frb production .",
    "the potential redshift ( @xmath87 ) of at  j0642.9@xmath115118 is consistent with the extragalactic dm of the frb @xcite .",
    "while other source channels have been more strongly advocated for frbs , it is not implausible that agn could produce frbs .",
    "millisecond - duration radio pulses propagating through relativistic plasma in agn jets may be immune to both absorption and scattering effects @xcite , implying that frbs originating close to launching regions could be observed from agn viewed along the jets .",
    "mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been proposed for the production of frbs in agn jets , analogous to the mechanisms for generating tev photons .",
    "there are however reasons to disfavor an association between at  j0642.9@xmath115118 and the frb .",
    "the background transient and variable event rate at @xmath29  ghz ( where the flare is the most prominent ) , and hence the false - alarm rate for the association , is poorly constrained .",
    "even so , the frb rate needs to be reconciled with the background rate @xcite .",
    "intrinsic agn variability is likely to dominate the background slow - transient rate . a detailed analysis of the radio agn population and its variability properties in comparison with the frb rate",
    "would be required to assess how commonly a single object would be expected to emit an frb , and what its signature could be .",
    "further physical modeling of the conditions and orientations under which frbs could escape agn would help refine such an analysis .",
    "this analysis would be further aided by a large area survey for transient and variable sources at high frequencies , as well as dedicated follow - up observations of other frbs , in particular to assess the frequency of short - duration flares in agn .",
    "however , a substantially more constraining result would be the direct interferometric localization of a population of frbs to flaring agn .",

    "<S> the localization of fast radio bursts ( frbs ) has been hindered by the poor angular resolution of the detection observations and inconclusive identification of transient or variable counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> recently a @xmath0-ray pulse of @xmath1  s duration has been associated with the fast radio burst frb  131104 . </S>",
    "<S> we report on radio - continuum imaging observations of the original localization region of the frb , beginning three days after the event and comprising 25 epochs over 2.5  yr . besides probabilistic arguments that suggest that the association between the @xmath0-ray transient and the frb is not compelling , we provide upper limits on a putative radio afterglow of this transient that are at odds with standard models for its progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> we further report the discovery of an unusual variable radio source spatially and temporally coincident with frb  131104 , but not spatially coincident with the @xmath0-ray event . </S>",
    "<S> the radio variable flares by a factor of @xmath2 above its long term average within @xmath3  d of the frb at 7.5ghz , with a factor - of-@xmath4 increase at @xmath5  ghz . within our observations , </S>",
    "<S> the variable has persisted with only modest modulation and never approached the flux density observed in the days after the frb . </S>",
    "<S> we identify an optical counterpart to the variable . </S>",
    "<S> optical and infrared photometry , and deep optical spectroscopy , suggest that the object is a narrow - line radio agn . </S>"
