    "the study of hypernuclei has been attracting great interest of nuclear physics community in providing the information from nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction to hyperon - nucleon ( yn ) and hyperon - hyperon ( yy ) interactions . due to the injection of hyperons",
    "a new dimension is added in normal nuclear system and hyperons serve as a potential probe for exploring many nuclear properties in domain of strangeness  @xcite . however , hyperon - nucleon interaction is weaker than nucleon - nucleon but it is imperative as well as important to describe the nuclear many - body system with strangeness .",
    "various theoretical approaches skyrme hartree fock  @xcite , relativistic mean field  @xcite , cluster , variational , diffusion monte carlo  @xcite , and g - matrix  @xcite have been employed by scientific community to estimate the strength of hyperon - nucleon as well hyperon - hyperon interactions .",
    "further , these models have established themselves as very effective in testing the existence of bound hypernuclei and the stability of nucleonic core against hyperon(s ) addition or the occurrence of exotic strange matter which facilitate the path toward multi - strange systems .",
    "magic numbers in nuclear physics are certain neutron and proton numbers in atomic nuclei , in which higher stability in the ground state is observed than in the neighbouring nuclides and are most abundant in nature .",
    "the various experimental signatures that show discontinuity at magic numbers are : the energy required for the separation of one and two nucleons , the energies of alpha and beta transitions , pairing energy and the excitation of low - lying vibrational  @xcite .",
    "the separation energy is sensitive to the collective or single particle inter play and provides a sufficient information about the nuclear structure effects .",
    "the discovery of magic numbers paved the way to great progress in understanding of nuclear structure and these numbers became the cornerstones for future theoretical developments in nuclear physics .",
    "it is worthy to mention that the several signatures are seen for the evolution of the magic gaps along the nuclear chart including superheavy region  @xcite .",
    "the quest for proton or neutron magic numbers in the elusive mass region of superheavy nuclei is of utmost importance as the mere existence of superheavy nuclei is the result of the interplay between the attractive nuclear force ( shell effects ) and the large disruptive coulomb repulsion between the protons that favours the fission  @xcite .",
    "it is well established that 2 , 8 , 20 , 28 , 50 , 82 and 126 are the nucleonic magic number .",
    "in addition to this , z = 120 and n = 172 , 184 are predicted to be next magic number by various theoretical models in superheavy mass region  @xcite .",
    "these predictions have been made on the basis of separation energy , shell gaps , pairing energy and shell correction energy etc .",
    "it may therefore relevant to extend the line of thought to the hypernuclear chart .",
    "it is well known that the spin - orbit interaction in @xmath0 channel is weaker than nucleonic sector and thus the @xmath0 magic numbers are expected to be close to the harmonic oscillator ones : 2 , 8 , 20 , 40 and 70 . in this paper , our main motive is to make an extensive investigation to search the @xmath0 magic number within the rmf approach and to obtain the stability of triply magic system with doubly magic core .",
    "the magic numbers in nuclei are characterized by a large shell gap in single - particle energy levels .",
    "this means that the nucleon in the lower level has a comparatively large value of energy than that on higher level giving rise to more stability .",
    "the extra stability corresponding to certain number can be estimated from the sudden fall in the separation energy .",
    "the @xmath0 separation energy is considered to be one of the key quantity to reveal the nuclear response to the addition of lambda hyperon .",
    "therefore , in present work , we obtain the the binding energy per particle and one - lambda as well as two - lambda separation energies for considered multi - hypernuclei .",
    "moreover , two - lambda shell gaps is also calculated to make the clear presentation of the magic number which also support to the two - lambda separation energy . to mark the @xmath0 shell gaps , single - particle energy levels",
    "are analyzed that may correspond to @xmath0 magic number .",
    "in addition , to analyze the structural distribution as well as impact of @xmath0 hyperon on bubble structure for considered nuclei , total ( nucleon plus @xmath0 ) density is reported .",
    "nucleon and lambda mean field and spin - orbit interaction potentials are also observed . on the basis of binding energy per particle , the stability of triply magic hypernuclei",
    "is reported .",
    "rmf theory has been quite successful for studying the infinite nuclear systems and finite nuclei including the superheavy mass region  @xcite .",
    "it is quite successful to study the equation of state for infinite nuclear matter as well as pure neutron matter , where the existence of strange baryons is expected  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "addition of strangeness degree of freedom to rmf formalism is obvious for the suitable expansion of the model and such type of attempts have already been made  @xcite .",
    "rmf explains not only the structural properties of singly strange hypernuclei but also provides the details study of multi - strange systems containing several @xmath0 s , @xmath1 s or @xmath2 s .",
    "in fact , rmf explains spin - orbit interaction very nicely in normal nuclei as well as hypernuclei .",
    "the contribution of spin - orbit interaction is very crucial in emerging the magic number in nucleonic sector and the same is expected in strange sector .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : a brief introduction on hypernuclei and magic number is given in section  [ int ] .",
    "section  [ form ] gives a brief description of relativistic mean field formalism for hypernuclei with inclusion of @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section  [ resu ] .",
    "the paper is summarized in section  [ sum ] .",
    "relativistic mean field theory has been applied succesfully to study the structural properties of normal nuclei as well as hypernuclei  @xcite . the suitable expansion to hypernuclei has been made by including the lambda - baryon interaction lagrangian with effective @xmath0n potential .",
    "the total lagrangian density for single-@xmath0 hypernuclei has been given in many refs .",
    "@xcite . for dealing the multi - lambda hypernuclei in quantitative way",
    ", the additional strange scalar ( @xmath5 ) and vector ( @xmath6 ) mesons have been included which simulate the @xmath4 interaction  @xcite .",
    "now , the total lagrangian density can be written as @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the dirac spinors for nucleon and @xmath0-hyperon , whose masses are m and @xmath11 , respectively . because of zero isospin , the @xmath0-hyperon does not couple to @xmath12- mesons .",
    "the quantities @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the masses of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 mesons and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are their coupling constants , respectively .",
    "the nonlinear self - interaction coupling of @xmath28 mesons is denoted by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the total energy of the system is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the sum of the single - particle energies of the nucleons ( n ) and hyperon ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the energies parts @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the contributions of meson fields , coulomb field , pairing energy and the center - of - mass energy , respectively . in present work , for meson - baryon coupling constant ,",
    "nl3 * parameter set is used through out the calculations  @xcite . to find the numerical values of used @xmath41meson coupling constants , we adopt the nucleon coupling to hyperon couplings ratio defined as ; @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the relative coupling values are used as @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49  @xcite . in present calculations",
    ", we use the constant gap bcs approximation to include the pairing interaction and the centre of mass correction is included by @xmath50 .",
    "before taking a detour on searching the @xmath0 magic behaviour in multi-@xmath0 hypernuclei , first we see the effects of introduced @xmath0 hyperon on normal nuclear core ; how the binding energy and radii of normal nuclear system is affected by addition of @xmath0 s ? to analyze this , we consider a list of normal nuclei covering a range from light to superheavy mass region i.e. @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "total binding energy ( be ) , binding energy per particle ( be / a ) , lambda binding energy ( @xmath53 ) for @xmath54 and @xmath55 state and radii for considered core nuclei and corresponding hypernuclei are tabulated in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the calculated @xmath53 is compared with available experimental data and we found a close agreement between them .",
    "this means the used parameter set is quite efficient to reproduce the experimental binding energy and ofcourse we can use it to make more calculations related to magicity in hypernuclei . since , we are dealing with closed shell hypernuclei and hence our rmf calculations is restricted to spherical symmetric .",
    "the addition of @xmath0 hyperon to normal nuclei enhances the binding and shrinks the core of the system .",
    "this is because of glue like role of @xmath0 hyperon that residing on the @xmath54state for most of the time .",
    "these observations are shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "binding energy of hypernuclei are larger than their normal counter parts and a reduction in total radius ( @xmath56 ) of hypernuclei is observed , that means the @xmath0 particle makes the core compact with increasing binding .",
    "for example , the total radius of @xmath51 and @xmath57 is 2.541 and 5.624 fm , which reduce to 2.536 and 5.616 fm by addition of single @xmath0 into the core of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "moreover , for the sake of comparison with experimental data , binding energy and radii of the hypernuclei produced by replacing the neutrons means having a constant baryon number are also framed in table  [ tab1 ] and the shrinkage effect is also noticed .",
    "this results show that an important impact of @xmath0 hyperon on binding as well as size of the system . the increasing value of @xmath53 for @xmath54state from light to superheavy hypernuclei confirming the potential depth of @xmath41particle in nuclear matter which would be -28  mev  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]      various signatures of the evolution of magic shell gaps have been discovered across the nuclear landscape during the past few decades  @xcite such as ( i ) a large binding energy then neighbouring nuclides , ( ii ) sudden fall at separation energy , ( iii ) a large shell gap , etc .",
    "it becomes therefore quite relevant to extend the prediction of magic numbers to the hypernuclear chart .",
    "looking for the magic behaviour firstly , we emphasize on binding of some selected nuclei whose nucleonic core is doubly magic such as @xmath58 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath59 and @xmath64 .",
    "some certain number of @xmath0 hyperon binds the nuclear core with maximum stability that may correspond to @xmath0 magic number in hypernuclei and might form a triple magic system with doubly magic nuclear core as initially discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and recently in ref .",
    "for example , @xmath65 2 , produce a maximum binding for @xmath51 and @xmath66 reveal the maximum binding with @xmath65 8 .",
    "also , @xmath52 shows a peak binding on addition of 90 @xmath0 s . in this way",
    ", we extract some lambda number which are 2 , 8 , 18 , 20 , 40 , 70 , 90 produce a maximum stability for their particular system and suppose to be @xmath0 magic number as much as close to harmonic oscillator number .",
    "but several other strong signatures are exist to identify the magicity and we make the analysis in this direction to look out the correct @xmath0 magic number . after analyzing the @xmath67 and @xmath68 , for considered light to superheavy mass multi - hypernuclei",
    "it is noticed that a sudden fall is observed at @xmath65 2 , 8 , 14 , 20 , 28 , 34 , 40 , 50 , 58 , 68 , 70 and 82 .",
    "and hence , the analysis suggest that these numbers are supposed to be @xmath0 magic number in multi - lambda hypernuclei and form a triply magic system having doubly magic nucleonic core .    in order to identify the @xmath0 magic number strongly ,",
    "two - lambda shell gaps is examined which provide more strong signature of magicity and favoured @xmath68 . pronounced peak in two - lambda shell gap",
    "is observed at @xmath65 2 , 8 , 20 and 40 indicating a strong shell closure .",
    "the peaks observed with a significant magnitude at @xmath65 14 , 18 , 34 , 50 , 58 , 70 and 82 indicating a shell closure also . further to testify , we look for the lambda shell gaps by examining the single - particle energy levels .",
    "we noticed that a large single - particle gap is appeared in @xmath69 hypernucleus at @xmath65 2 , 8 , 18 , 20 , 28 , 34 , 40 , 50 , 58 and 70 confirming the lambda magic number .",
    "the analysis of single - particle energy levels for @xmath52 multi hypernuclei clear the results by showing a large energy gap in 2 , 8 , 18 , 20 , 34 , 40 , 50 , 58 , 70 and 82 .",
    "it is to mention that a significant shell gap is observed for 34 and 58 suggesting a strong @xmath0 shell closure .",
    "the inversion of normal level scheme is responsible to emerge the @xmath0 magic number 34 and 58 .",
    "the experimentally confirmation of nucleonic shell closure of 34 supports our predictions  @xcite .",
    "the nucleonic number 14 , 16 , 18 and 32 have also been in discussion and expected to be shell closure  @xcite . in addition , nucleon number 16 and 32 have also been experimentally confirmed in exotic nuclei as a new neutron magic number  @xcite . therefore , it is concluded that the @xmath0 magicity quite resembles with the nuclear magicity and it is expected that our predictions might be used as significant input to make the things clear regarding new sub shell closure .",
    "the predicted @xmath0 magic number in multi - hypernuclei are framed in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the present lambda magic numbers are quite agreeable with the prediction of ref .  @xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite where bruckner - hartee fock calculations using the lambda density functional have been made .",
    "it is clear from the plot of @xmath70 , that 34 , 58 and 70 have peaks of great magnitude , while 68 in a feeble magnitude and suppose to be subshell closure .",
    "moreover , strong nucleonic magic number 28 is observed very feeble in lambda magicity .",
    "it is to mention that the lambda number 14 is appeared in medium mass hypernuclei , on contrary to this 18 is observed in superheavy mass multi hypernuclei .",
    "in summary , we have suggested the possible @xmath0 magic number i.e. 2 , 8 , 14 , 18 , 20 , 28 , 34 , 40 , 50 , 58 , 68 , 70 , 82 in multi-@xmath0 hypernuclei within the relativistic mean field theory with effective @xmath0n as well as @xmath0@xmath0 interactions .",
    "the survey of @xmath0 magic number is made on the basis of binding energy , one- and two - lambda separation energies @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and two - lambda shell gaps @xmath70 .",
    "it is noticed that pronounced single particle energy gap is observed for lambda number 34 and 58 in pb and superheavy multi hypernuclei representing the strong @xmath0 magic number .",
    "our predictions are strongly supported by nuclear magicity , where nucleon number 34 is experimentally confirmed as a neutron shell closure  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the weakening strength of lambda spin - orbit interaction potential is responsible for emerging the new lambda magic number .",
    "the predicted @xmath0 magic numbers are in remarkable agreement with earlier predictions  @xcite and hypernucler magicity quite resembles with nuclear magicity . in the analogy of nuclear stability , we noticed a similar pattern of binding energy per particle in hypernuclear regime and ni hypernucleus with 8 @xmath0 s is found to be most tightly bound triply magic system in hypernuclear landscape .",
    "the addition of @xmath0 hyperons have significant impact on nucleon distribution and remove the bubble structure partially or fully . the spin - orbit interaction potentials and mean field potentials",
    "is also studied for predicted triply magic hypernuclear systems and the added @xmath0 s affect both the potential to a large extent .",
    "the present results may be used as a significant input to produce the triply magic hypernuclei in laboratory in future .",
    "it is also concluded that the addition of @xmath0 hyperons draw the nuclear system towards more stability with increasing strangeness .",
    "we noticed that the core of superheavy nuclei has more affinity to absorb large number of hyperons .",
    "this means such systems are able to simulate the strange hadronic matter containing large number of heavy hyperons such as @xmath1 s and @xmath2 s including several @xmath0 s and the formation of such systems has large implication in nuclear - astrophysics .",

    "<S> in present study , we search the lambda magic number in hypernuclei within the framework of relativistic mean field theory ( rmf ) with inclusion of hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon potentials . based on one- and two - lambda separation energy and two - lambda shell gap ; 2 , 8 , 14 , 18 , 20 , 28 , 34 , 40 , 50 , 58 , 68 , 70 and 82 are suggested to be the @xmath0 magic number within the present approach . </S>",
    "<S> the weakening strength of @xmath0 spin - orbit interaction is responsible for emerging the new lambda shell closure other than the model scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted @xmath0 magic numbers are in remarkable agreement with earlier predictions and hypernuclear magicity quite resembles with nuclear magicity . </S>",
    "<S> our results are supported by nuclear magicity , where neutron number n = 34 is experimentally observed as a magic which is one of the @xmath0 closed shell in our predictions . in addition , the stability of hypernuclei is also examined by calculating the binding energy per particle , where ni hypernucleus is found to be most tightly bound triply magic system in considered hypernuclei . </S>",
    "<S> nucleon and lambda density distributions are observed and it is found that introduced @xmath0 s have significant impact on total density and reduces the central depression of the core nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> nucleon and lambda mean field potentials and spin - orbit interaction potentials are also observed for predicted triply magic hypernuclei and the addition of @xmath0 s affect the both the potentials to a large extent . </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle energy levels are also analyzed to explain the shell gaps for triply magic multi-@xmath0 hypernuclei . </S>"
