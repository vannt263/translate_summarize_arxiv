    "there is growing evidence indicating that non - baryonic cold dark matter constitutes a major component of the universe s total mass , seen only via its gravitational influences @xcite .",
    "current models of the universe @xcite suggest that it accounts for @xmath2 of the closure density of the universe .    weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are a promising cold dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "wimps , stable particles which arise in extensions of the standard model , undergo only weak - scale interactions with matter but have masses ranging from tens of gev to a few tev . if wimps exist , their relic abundance ( governed by electroweak scale interactions ) is remarkably close to the inferred density of dark matter in the universe @xcite .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) of supersymmetric theories is a theoretically well developed wimp candidate @xcite .",
    "if r - parity is conserved , the lsp is stable and hence should be present in the universe as a cosmological relic from the big bang .",
    "a likely candidate for this lsp is the neutralino @xcite .",
    "current lep data and cosmological constraints impose a lower limit of about 51  gev and an upper limit of 600  gev on the neutralino mass @xcite .",
    "in this paper we describe an indirect method to search for such relic wimps using the super  kamiokande detector to look for a high energy neutrino signal resulting from wimp annihilation in the earth , the sun , and the galactic center .",
    "this is in contrast to direct - detection experiments which look for signatures of wimp interactions with a nucleus in a low background detector .",
    "however , both direct and indirect detection experiments probe the coupling of wimps to nuclei , allowing a comparison of our results with those of direct - detection of dark matter experiments .",
    "if wimps are indeed the dark matter composing our galactic halo they will accumulate in the sun and earth . when their orbits pass though a celestial body the wimps have a small but finite probability of elastically scattering with a nucleus .",
    "if the resulting velocity after such scattering is less than the escape velocity , they become gravitationally trapped and eventually settle into the core of that body .",
    "wimps which have accumulated in this way annihilate into @xmath3 leptons , b , c and t quarks , gauge bosons , and higgs bosons . over time",
    ", equilibrium is achieved between capture and annihilation , making the annihilation rate half of the capture rate .",
    "high energy @xmath1are produced by the decay of the annihilation products .",
    "the expected neutrino fluxes from the capture and annihilation of wimps in the sun and earth depend upon the composition and escape velocity of the celestial body , the flux of wimps , and the the wimp - nucleon scattering cross - section .",
    "there are many calculations of expected neutrino fluxes from wimp capture and annihilation in the sun and earth @xcite .",
    "recently it has also been noticed that if cold dark matter is present at the galactic center it can be accreted by the central black hole into a dense spike in the density distribution @xcite .",
    "wimp annihilations in this region could make it a compact source of high energy neutrinos .",
    "the energetic @xmath1resulting from wimp annihilation could be detected in neutrino detectors .",
    "the mean neutrino energy ranges from 1/3 to 1/2 the mass of the wimp , and the neutrinos can undergo charged current interactions with the rock around the detector to produce muons .",
    "thus , neutrino - induced muons coming from the direction of the sun , the earth and the galactic center could provide a signature of non - baryonic cold dark matter .",
    "the super  kamiokande ( `` super  k '' ) detector is a 50,000  tonne water cherenkov detector , located in the kamioka - mozumi mine in japan with 1000  m rock overburden .",
    "it is divided by a lightproof barrier into an inner detector with 11,146 inward - facing 50  cm hamamatsu photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) and an outer detector equipped with 1,885 outward - facing 20  cm hamamatsu pmts serving as a cosmic ray veto counter @xcite .",
    "interactions of atmospheric @xmath1 in the rock around the detector produce upward through - going muons in super ",
    "k energetic enough to cross the entire detector .",
    "the effective target volume extends outward for many tens of meters into the surrounding rock and increases with the energy of the incoming neutrino , as the higher energy muons resulting from these interactions can travel longer distances to reach the detector .",
    "upward through - going muons are the signature of the highest energy portion of the atmospheric neutrino spectrum observed by super  k , with the calculated parent neutrino energy spectrum peaking at 100  gev @xcite .",
    "the downward going cosmic ray muon rate in super ",
    "k is 3  hz , making it impossible to distinguish downward - going neutrino - induced muons from this large background , restricting neutrino detection to those events coming from below .",
    "event reconstruction of a muon is performed using the charge and timing information recorded by the pmt s .",
    "muons are required to have @xmath4  meters measured path length ( e@xmath5  gev ) in the inner detector , resulting in an effective area for upward through - going muons of @xmath6 with a trigger efficiency of @xmath7100% .",
    "the arrival direction and time is reconstructed for each muon , with the reconstructed direction of the muon an average of @xmath8 from the direction of the parent neutrino .",
    "1416 upward through - muon events have been observed in 1268 live - days from april 1996 to april 2000 .",
    "more details of the data reduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "the expected background for a wimp search due to interactions of atmospheric @xmath9 s in the rock below the detector is evaluated with monte carlo ( `` mc '' ) simulations using the bartol atmospheric @xmath10 flux @xcite , the grv-94 parton distribution function @xcite , energy loss mechanisms of muons in rock from @xcite , and a geant - based detector simulation .",
    "analysis of the most recent super - k atmospheric neutrino data @xcite is consistent with @xmath11 oscillations with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "therefore for evaluating our background we suppress the atmospheric muon neutrino flux using these oscillation parameters . for the sun",
    ", there is an additional background of high energy neutrinos resulting from cosmic ray interactions in the sun itself , but this is about 3 orders of magnitude less than the observed atmospheric @xmath10 flux and hence can be neglected @xcite .",
    "an absolute normalization for the total neutrino flux was obtained by constraining the total number of mc events to be equal to the observed events after taking oscillations into account . in order to compare the expected and observed distributions of upward through - going muon events with respect to the sun and galactic center , each mc event",
    "was assigned a random time based on the arrival times of the observed upward through - going muon events .",
    "this procedure allowed the angle between each mc muon and any celestial object to be obtained , and thus the distribution of observed and expected upward muons about the three celestial bodies .",
    "we searched for a statistically significant excess of observed neutrino - induced upward through - going muons compared to the mc background in cones about the potential source with half angles ranging from 5 to 30 degrees .",
    "smaller wimp masses result in a larger angular spread of the resulting muons , so different cone angles are used to ensure the capture of @xmath14 of the signal for a wide range of wimp masses .",
    "the different cone angles optimize the signal - to - noise ratio for various potential wimp masses .",
    "no statistically significant excess was seen in any of the half angle cones .",
    "we can therefore calculate the flux limit of excess neutrino - induced muons in each of the cones .",
    "the flux limit is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the poissonian upper limit ( 90% c.l . )",
    "given the number of measured events and expected background due to atmospheric neutrinos @xcite ( taking into account oscillations ) , and the denominator is the exposure where a(@xmath17 ) is the detector area in the direction of the expected signal ( @xmath17 ) ; @xmath18 is the detector efficiency ( @xmath19 for upward through - going muons ) ; and t is the experimental livetime .",
    "figure  [ fig-4 ] shows the flux limits thus obtained for various cone sizes .",
    "varying the oscillation parameters applied to the background calculation only slightly changes the flux limits close to the celestial objects .",
    "the cone with half angle @xmath20 experiences the largest fluctuation , with the flux limits varying as much as 10@xmath21 for different oscillation parameters in the neighborhood of the super  k allowed region .",
    "the comparison of super - k flux limits with previous estimates by other experiments is also shown in figure  [ fig-4 ] .",
    "all the other experiments have muon energy thresholds around 1  gev .",
    "the wimp flux limits for the earth and the sun by macro , kamiokande , baksan , and imb are given in @xcite , and the wimp flux limits for the galactic center by the above detectors are given in @xcite .",
    ", the x - axis is half - cone angle size in degrees.,width=313 ]    once wimps are gravitationally captured in the sun and the earth they settle into the core with an isothermal distribution equal to the core temperature of the sun or the earth  @xcite .",
    "although both the sun and the galactic center are effectively point sources of energetic neutrinos resulting from wimp annihilations , the earth is not . furthermore , muons scatter from the incoming direction of their parent neutrino due to the kinematics of the initial interaction and multiple coulomb scattering in the rock below the detector .    the kamiokande collaboration @xcite has calculated the angular windows for sun and earth which contain 90@xmath21 of the signal for various wimp masses .",
    "using these windows , 90@xmath21 confidence level flux limits can be converted to a function of wimp mass using the cones which collect 90@xmath21 of expected signal for any given mass .",
    "these flux limits as a function of wimp mass are shown in figure  [ fig-7 ] for the earth and sun .",
    "in contrast to the indirect wimp search described above , direct - detection experiments seek to observe the @xmath22(kev ) energy deposited in a low - background detector when a wimp elastically scatters from a nucleus therein .",
    "however , rates for both techniques depend primarily upon the wimp nucleon cross - section , either to collide with a nucleus in the detector , or in a celestial body ( and drop below the excape velocity ) .",
    "the two additional uncertainties which arise in indirect searches for wimps relate to the second moment of the neutrino energy spectrum and the suppression of annihilation of wimps relative to capture .",
    "thus , using extreme cases for the above two factors it is possible to compare the sensitivities of direct and indirect experiments .",
    "@xcite calculate the maximum and minimum values of the ratio of direct to indirect detection rates for wimps with both scalar and axial vector interactions .",
    "they find that the event rate in a 1  kg of germanium detector is equivalent to that in @xmath23 @xmath24 of upward muon detector .",
    "the dama direct - detection experiment reports a detection of wimps based on the annual modulation of their event rate .",
    "their cumulative analysis is consistent with the possible presence of wimp at the 4@xmath25 confidence level , with the best fit values being : @xmath26 = 52  gev and @xmath27  pb @xcite .",
    "the cdms direct - detection experiment , however , does not see any wimp signal .",
    "cdms data give limits on the spin - independent wimp - nucleon elastic - scattering cross - section that exclude parameter space above a wimp mass of 10  gev  c@xmath28 .",
    "this excludes the entire 3@xmath25 allowed region for the wimp signal reported by the dama experiment at @xmath29  c.l . @xcite .    using the results of @xcite it is possible to obtain limits on wimp - nucleon spin - independent cross - section from the super - k flux limits and compare them with the results of the dama and cdms direct - detection experiments .",
    "the combined wimp flux limits from the sun and the earth as a function of wimp mass were calculated . since the goal is to calculate an _ upper limit _ on wimp - nucleon cross - section , the most conservative direct / indirect ratio in @xcite was used with the super  k flux limits to calculate the limit on wimp nucleon cross - section as a function of wimp mass .",
    "the super - k upper limits on wimp nucleon cross - section are shown in figure  [ figsk ] , along with the cdms upper limits and the dama best fit region .",
    "these limits rule out a signification portion of the wimp parameter space favored by the dama experiment .",
    "allowed region ( inside crosses ) and the cdms 90% c.l .",
    "excluded region ( above dashed line).,width=313 ]",
    "an indirect search for dark matter was performed using 1416 neutrino - induced upward through - going muon events observed by the super - k detector corresponding to 1268 days of livetime .",
    "high energy @xmath9 can be produced from wimp annihilation in the sun , the earth , and the galactic center .",
    "we looked for an excess of upward muons over the atmospheric neutrino background coming from near those bodies .",
    "no statistically significant excess was seen .",
    "the lack of excess neutrinos allows flux limits to be obtained for various cone angles around these potential sources and compared with previous measurements from other detectors . for the sun and the earth these flux limits",
    "can be calculated as a function of the wimp mass .",
    "a comparison of these results with the direct - detection results from cdms and dama shows a similar sensitivity to a potential wimp signal over a wide range of parameter space .",
