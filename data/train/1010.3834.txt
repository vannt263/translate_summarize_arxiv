    "the information loss problem @xcite is related to the issue of whether or not the quantum theory of gravity is unitary .",
    "it is unclear how we can reconstruct the original information of a black hole after the black hole has totally evaporated .",
    "if a theory is not unitary , we can not expect a fundamental predictability from the theory .",
    "therefore , many researchers have tried to explain how a black hole can conserve information during the evaporation @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "an even worse situation occurs if there is a wormhole or a bubble universe that includes a second asymptotic region .",
    "if a wormhole metric is given , it will violate unitarity @xcite ; and if there is a sufficient amount of exotic matter , we can maintain the wormhole for quite long time @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear how to build such an initial condition . in many cases",
    ", the initial condition already violates unitarity so that a wormhole is not related to the information loss problem .",
    "there have been some discussions suggesting that we can derive a bubble universe from a false vacuum bubble in a true vacuum background @xcite . according to the thin shell approximation",
    ", we can obtain a bubble universe solution that inflates inside of a schwarzschild wormhole @xcite@xcite@xcite ; however , if we assume the null energy condition and global hyperbolicity , whenever we obtain such inflating bubble solutions , the initial conditions suffer from the past incompleteness @xcite . therefore ,",
    "unless we violate the null energy condition , we can not derive a bubble universe .",
    "of course , if we assume arbitrary exotic matter by hand , we can induce a bubble universe , but it is not justified unless the matter is allowed by a fundamental theory , e.g. , string theory . a better idea to overcome",
    "the null energy condition was to assume a tunneling , the so - called farhi - guth - guven tunneling @xcite .",
    "the probability of such tunneling was calculated though it was extremely low . however ,",
    "if it is possible in principle , it may imply that the nature allows a violation of unitarity .",
    "on the other hand , when the geometry of the background is an anti de sitter space , according to the ads / cft correspondence @xcite ( and if we trust the correspondence ) , the time evolution in the anti de sitter background should be unitary @xcite ( this idea may be extended to a de sitter background @xcite ) .",
    "then , we can choose between two possibilities :    1 .",
    "the generation of a bubble universe does not necessarily imply a violation of unitarity , 2 .",
    "farhi - guth - guven tunneling is impossible in such a situation .",
    "for the first possibility , we can guess that although a schwarzschild wormhole ( or black hole ) separates two universes and information passes from the first to the second asymptotic region , hawking radiation from the black hole can emit information to the first asymptotic region .",
    "this should imply a copy of information on a space - like hypersurface .",
    "although such a copy is improbable , if no observer can see the copy of information , we can relax ; this is known as the black hole complementarity principle @xcite . although local physics seems to be violated , no one can see the violation , and then , it is `` a perfect crime . ''",
    "however , according to our previous papers , we strongly suspect that black hole complementarity is not a correct conjecture @xcite@xcite .",
    "if our opinion is correct , then the reasonable next choice is to think that such exotic tunneling should not be allowed in the anti de sitter background .",
    "apart from our opinion , the second possibility is also the consensus between people who are involved in holography .",
    "only classically buildable bubbles that do not contain inflating regions are allowed by unitary processes @xcite .    in this controversial context",
    ", we will argue that a bubble universe solution is possible without assuming unbuildable bubbles .",
    "_ we will only assume buildable bubbles _",
    ", where the term ` buildable ' means that the bubble does not contain an inflating region . however , we can violate the null energy condition through hawking radiation of the de sitter space @xcite ; a false vacuum bubble will emit hawking radiation and will violate the null energy condition @xcite@xcite .",
    "then an outside observer of the bubble can obtain a small region that can be approximated by a negative energy bath , which means the region is homogeneously filled by negative energy .",
    "if we further assume that there is a second tunneling of a false vacuum bubble in the negative energy bath , then the region allows expanding and inflating bubble solutions via a violation of the null energy condition , even though the bubble is classically buildable .    in this paper",

    "as we know , there is no known false vacuum bubble bounce solution if the bubble is smaller than the size of the horizon of the background de sitter space @xcite@xcite .",
    "+ however , in scalar - tensor gravity , there are some bounce solutions of false vacuum bubbles @xcite , and in some cases , the scalar - tensor gravity will be embedded in string theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , although it is rare , string theory may allow such situations .",
    "2 .   in many cases ,",
    "we observed not only outgoing negative energy fluxes but also outgoing positive energy fluxes . of course",
    ", in the thin shell limit , we will control such excessive energy to be sufficiently small .",
    "however , in realistic and natural situations , the positive energy flux may annihilate negative energy baths .",
    "even though such a negative energy bath is formed , the amount of negative energy will in general be very small . then",
    ", to see the formation of a bubble universe , the tension of the bubble should be extremely small while the inside vacuum energy remains at a constant value .",
    "it is not impossible in principle , as long as we tune the potential so that the difference of fields between the two vacuums to be sufficiently small @xcite .",
    "however , it needs a fine - tuning on the potential .",
    "if a potential has fundamental constraints , then such small tensions will not be obtained and hence the negative energy bath will be disabled by large tensions .",
    "4 .   in addition",
    ", although such tension is sufficiently small , as the shell expands , if the shell becomes larger than the region of the negative energy bath , the tension will be positive again .",
    "therefore , the effective cosmological constant of the inside de sitter space should be sufficiently large so that inflation begins before the shell becomes larger than the negative energy bath .",
    "+ however , if we assume an arbitrarily fine - tuned potential ( e.g. , landscape @xcite ) , such small tension is possible in principle .",
    "therefore , the scenario of the formation of a bubble universe using a negative energy bath requires favorable chances and fine - tunings of the potential .",
    "however , if it is in principle possible , for example in string theory , then it will still have theoretical importance .",
    "we studied the dynamics of collapsing false vacuum bubbles with semi - classical effects beyond the thin shell approximation using double - null simulations . using this setup , we investigated the possibility of the generation of a negative energy bath using buildable bubbles .",
    "we also studied the creation of a bubble universe in a negative energy bath .",
    "there is a novel comment on the causal structure of a collapsing false vacuum bubble .",
    "an ingoing observer can not see @xmath183 at the @xmath127 horizon if there is no violation of the null energy condition . if a false vacuum bubble which is slightly larger than the size of the horizon of the internal de sitter space collapses , the @xmath128 region should disappear , and it seems that @xmath184 at the @xmath127 horizon . as we violate the null energy condition by renormalized energy - momentum tensors , we can smoothly connect a de sitter space and a flat space .",
    "therefore , the semi - classical effects regularize and smoothly connect the dynamics of false vacuum bubbles .    before concluding this paper , we summarize the already known ideas and our new conclusions and suggestions .",
    "the following ideas are already known by previous researchers :    * if tunneling from a buildable bubble to a unbuildable bubble is possible , it will violate unitarity @xcite ; but it is controversial whether or not such tunneling is allowed @xcite . *",
    "false vacuum bubbles violate the null energy condition and emit negative energy to an out - going null direction @xcite@xcite@xcite . * if a violation of the null energy condition is allowed so that the tension of a false vacuum bubble can be negative , then an expanding and inflating bubble is buildable and possible @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "now the authors contribute the follow points in this paper :    * we numerically confirm the emission of the negative energy of false vacuum bubbles , even though the false vacuum bubble is buildable . as we tune initial conditions , the amount of negative energy is sufficiently controllable . *",
    "the authors connect ideas ( b ) and ( c ) above to make a bubble universe , without assuming unbuildable bubbles : if negative energy ( emitted by buildable false vacuum bubbles ) is concentrated in a region ( idea ( b ) ) , then it will be possible to see an expanding and inflating bubble in the region ( idea ( c ) ) .",
    "first of all , we reduced one condition for a bubble universe to other simple conditions .",
    "previously , researchers thought that to obtain a bubble universe from buildable bubbles , we needed farhi - guth - guven tunneling .",
    "now we argue that farhi - guth - guven tunneling is not a necessary condition and even though we have buildable bubbles , they violate the null energy condition and it will be possible to form a bubble universe .",
    "the other necessary conditions of our scenario are some fine - tunings of the potential .",
    "although it is unnatural , if string theory allows such fine - tunings , this can be a good starting point for interesting discussions on information and unitarity .",
    "the authors would like to thank ewan stewart , jakob hansen and wonwoo lee for discussions and encouragement .",

    "we know the exact @xmath195-dimensional results ( up to @xmath135-loop order ) and hence equations  ( [ tq1 ] ) , ( [ tq2 ] ) , and ( [ tq3 ] ) are the most intuitive and reasonable approximation to the @xmath196-dimensional cases . for black hole cases ,",
    "there are studies confirm that this approximation gives correct thermodynamics @xcite .    here",
    ", we applied this method to a false vacuum bubble . however , there are some obstacles to comparing the analytic results and the numerical results in the false vacuum background .",
    "the known semi - classical results are temperature , entropy , the renormalized energy - momentum tensor components , etc . , for the _ static limit _ or for the de sitter space .",
    "the relevant quantity is to compare the renormalized energy - momentum tensor components of the static limit to our numerical results .",
    "note that , in our setup , we prepare a classical background without hawking radiation and then we turn on a field combination or hawking radiation on the background .",
    "( of course , the einstein equations and field equations are satisfied . )",
    "therefore , energy - momentum tensor components can not be static and they are essentially time dependent .",
    "moreover , the energy - momentum tensors will give back - reactions to the metric components and these back - reactions will make the comparison difficult .    in this appendix",
    ", we compare the energy - momentum tensor components @xmath197 as we vary @xmath112 .",
    "we have to determine a space - time position where we make comparison .",
    "this is not so well - defined , but one reasonable position is to see the maximum value of @xmath197 along an almost asymptotic out - going null surface ( @xmath198 ) , since that is relatively free from the back - reactions of renormalized energy - momentum tensors .",
    "figure  [ fig : test ] is a plot for the maximum of @xmath199 along an asymptotic surface ( @xmath198 ) as varying @xmath201 .",
    "the gradient is @xmath200 and approximately @xmath135 .",
    "note that the smallest value of @xmath197 is observed on an almost same radius .",
    "we analytically expect that the renormalized energy - momentum tensors in a de sitter background should be @xcite @xmath202 where @xmath203 is a certain constant radius .",
    "therefore , we expect that the proportionality will be approximately @xmath135 .",
    "this correspondence is not so trivial since our numerical setup does not contain a direct relation between @xmath112 and @xmath197 .",
