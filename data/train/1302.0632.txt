    "single electron transistors consisting of a nanodevice placed between electrodes have received much attention recently since they are believed to carry great promise as a future replacement for conventional mosfet which will reach its limit at 10 nm in 2016 @xcite .",
    "unparalleled precision enabled by nanotechnology revolution brought immense momentum to this field .",
    "determination of the switching behaviour of these devices in the presence of strong electron - electron correlations is a requirement for their utilization in electrical circuits .",
    "moreover , investigation of transient electron dynamics @xcite should also help fine tuning of quantum computers @xcite as well as single electron guns @xcite .",
    "initial investigations on the effect of kondo correlations on the transient current flowing immediately after after abrupt changing of the gate or bias voltage @xcite uncovered different time scales @xcite .",
    "since it takes kondo resonance considerable amount of time to get fully formed @xcite , strong interference between the kondo resonance and the van hove singularities in the contacts density of states results in damped oscillations in the long timescale for an asymmetrically coupled system @xcite .",
    "better agreement between the experiments and theoretical predictions can be attained by using realistic density of states for the contacts with the help of ab initio methods @xcite .",
    "transport experiments can derive additional benefit from the measurement of thermopower ( seebeck coefficient ) @xmath0 since its sign is a benchmark providing direct information about the alignment of the impurity orbitals with respect to the fermi level of the contacts .",
    "consequently , this provides unambiguous evidence about the existence of kondo resonance at the fermi level of the contacts .",
    "recent experiments measuring thermoelectricity in molecular junctions yielded key signatures confirming these predictions @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical studies on this set - up mainly focused on steady - state behaviour of thermopower .",
    "different groups independently observed that the position of the dot level is critical to determine the sign of thermopower in kondo regime @xcite . in the first attempt to study the transient behaviour of thermopower @xcite",
    ", it was uncovered that the inverse of the saturated decay time of thermopower to its steady state value is equal to the kondo temperature when the dot level is abruptly moved to a position close to the fermi level such that the kondo resonance is present in the final position .",
    "it is quite interesting to investigate the effect of changing the left and right tunnel couplings of the dot to the electrodes sinusoidally with a phase lag @xcite .",
    "if the phase lag is nonzero , this results in asymmetrical coupling .",
    "another interesting situation arises when the dot energy level is subjected to time dependent ac perturbations in symmetrical coupling .",
    "this enables to monitor the evolution of thermopower in real time when the kondo temperature changes constantly as a result of the oscillatory motion of the dot energy level between the leads @xcite .",
    "this type kondo shuttling has been made possible with experimental advances on controlling dot - lead coupling @xcite .",
    "we previously studied the behaviour of current in this set - up and found that the time averaged conductance exhibits considerable deviation from its monotonic decrease as a function of applied bias when the bias is equal to the driving frequency @xcite .",

    "the electron operators on the dot are rewritten in terms of a massless ( slave ) boson operator and a pseudofermion operator as @xmath14 subject to the requirement that @xmath15 the last requirement is essentially a bookkeeping tool that prevents the double occupancy in the original hamiltonian when @xmath16 .",
    "the main advantage of using this transformation is that we can now safely drop the quartic hubbard term since its effects are now incorporated in other terms anyway .",

    "assuming no explicit time dependency for the hopping matrix elements , the coupling of the quantum dot to the electrodes for a symmetrically coupled system can be expressed as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a constant given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the density of states function of the electrodes .",

    "we accomplish this by solving coupled integro - differential dyson equations in a two - dimensional cartesian grid .",
    "however , the self - energy of the pseudofermion and slave boson must be built into these equations in order to be able to obtain a solution . to this end",

    "time averaged thermopower has been previously studied in this system neglecting the kondo effect @xcite .",

    "we will only consider the linear response instantaneous thermopower due to the validity of onsager relations in this regime .",
    "kondo effect has long been a trademark of many body physics taking place at sufficiently low temperatures due to a hybridization between the net spin localized inside an impurity and the continuum electrons of a nearby metal .",
    "its main manifestation is a sharp resonance around the fermi level of the metal arising when the impurity level is located below the fermi level .",

    "the dc value of the dot energy level was chosen as @xmath45 to ensure that the dot level lies sufficiently below the fermi level such that the kondo temperature is much lower than the ambient temperature . in principle , it is possible to choose a lower dot energy level as dc value . however , it would be problematic with our parameters because we would need to increase the driving amplitudes even higher in that case to approach the fermi level sufficiently and the dot energy level would go beyond the bandwidth which is at @xmath46 in its lowest position .",
    "this type of modulation induces a continuous change in kondo temperature @xmath33 since its value depends on the dot energy level in eq .",
    "( [ tkondo ] ) .",
    "consequently , the shape of the kondo resonance pinned to the fermi level of the contacts constantly changes .",

    "instantaneous thermopower is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for three different driving amplitudes @xmath44 immediately after the gate voltage has been turned on at constant driving frequency and ambient temperature . since the dot level is oscillating sinusoidally , the value of the kondo temperature is fluctuating alongside with it between zero and a maximum value .",
    "these maximum values are @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 for driving amplitudes of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively . in this figure ,",
    "thermopower slowly acquires a positive value as the dot level approaches the fermi level for all driving amplitudes . for the smallest driving amplitude , it reaches a maximum positive value at its closest point to the fermi level before it starts decreasing again as the dot level begins to go down",

    "[ fig2 ] , but the gate voltage is applied with a smaller frequency this time . an obvious consequence of this on the instantaneous thermopower is the longer oscillation periods for all driving amplitudes .",
    "besides this trivial effect , we notice that the smooth oscillation behaviour for the smallest driving amplitude did not change much . on the other hand , there are significant changes for the other two larger driving amplitude cases compared to the larger driving frequency .",
    "their fluctuation behaviour seems qualitatively similar but they both dive much deeper into negative territory as the dot level comes close to the fermi level .",

    "we will elucidate its reason later .",
    "[ fig4 ] depicts the time averaged value of the instantaneous thermopower as a function of inverse driving frequency for two different ambient temperatures at a constant driving amplitude of 2.5@xmath41 .",
    "the first conclusion that can be drawn from this figure is that the absolute value of the time averaged thermopower is always different at all driving frequencies when the ambient temperature changes .",
    "moreover , absolute value of the time averaged thermopower starts to increase for both ambient temperatures as the driving frequency is decreased but it saturates at a certain driving frequency and stays constant thereafter .    this is a quite peculiar and interesting observation and in order to test whether it is valid for other driving amplitudes as well , we performed the same analysis for the largest driving amplitude of 3.0@xmath41 keeping all the other parameters constant .",
    "we do not increase the driving amplitude beyond this value to avoid entering mixed valence regime where the kondo and breit - wigner resonances overlap .",
    "we are only interested in investigating the effect of kondo resonance on thermopower in this paper .",
    "the result for this driving amplitude can be seen in fig .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the conclusion we had drawn is indeed valid here too .",
    "namely , time averaged thermopower is quite sensitive to ambient temperature and it saturates when the driving frequency is decreased .",
    "however , there is an important difference .",
    "absolute values of the time averaged thermopower at both ambient temperatures and all driving frequencies are greater than the previous case in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where the driving amplitude was 2.5@xmath41 .",
    "this is also an important result which we will dwell on below .",
    "we now want to provide an unambiguous microscopic explanation to the results we presented above .",
    "it is clear that the development of the kondo resonance plays a crucial role in transport of this prototypical device .",
    "evolution of the kondo resonance is incorporated in the dot density of states and the relation between the dot density of states and the thermopower at low temperatures is given by the sommerfeld expansion .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath53 in atomic units . in this equation , @xmath54 is the value of the dot density of states at fermi level of the contacts and @xmath55 is its derivative .",
    "it has been shown that the formation of the kondo resonance occurs slightly above the fermi level @xcite making the derivative of the dot density of states at fermi level positive at ambient temperatures close to or less than the kondo temperature .",
    "this will give rise to a negative thermopower in this regime .",
    "on the other hand , breit - wigner resonance around the dot energy level is the only prominent feature of the dot density of states in the absence of kondo resonance at ambient temperatures much greater than the kondo temperature .",
    "consequently , the thermopower would be positive if the dot level is positioned sufficiently away from the fermi level since the dot density of states at fermi level will lie in the long tail of the breit - wigner resonance .",
    "thus , a shift in the sign of the thermopower by tuning the temperature is a signature of the emergence of the kondo resonance .",
    "= 0.003@xmath41 ( black dashed ) and @xmath40=0.002@xmath41 ( blue dot dashed ) for driving amplitude of 3.0@xmath41 . , width=328,height=226 ]    when the driving amplitude is 2.0@xmath41 , the dot level can not approach the fermi level to be able to develop the kondo resonance .",
    "therefore , t@xmath56 for all dot levels involved in this oscillation and the thermopower never dips into negative territory .",
    "it starts from zero when the dot level is farthest from the fermi level because the density of states is essentially zero everywhere around the fermi level .",
    "however , it gradually acquires a positive value as the dot level approaches the fermi level because the tail of the breit - wigner resonance starts to reach the fermi level causing a negative slope there .",
    "thermopower reaches a maximum positive value before the dot level starts to retreat .",
    "the values are not sensitive to temperature because kondo resonance can not be formed at all at any stage of this motion .",
    "the oscillation of the dot energy level covers a larger energy range as the driving amplitude is ramped up to 2.5@xmath41 .",
    "the value of the thermopower initially follows the value obtained when the driving amplitude was 2.0@xmath41 but it starts to deviate significantly when the dot level approaches the fermi level because the kondo resonance begins to emerge there . that is accompanied with a change in slope of the density of states of the dot and consequently a change in sign of the thermopower .",
    "the thermopower sees its minimum value when the dot level is at its closest point to the fermi level because the kondo resonance is at its most developed form here .",
    "as the dot level starts to retreat , the kondo resonance is gradually suppressed hence the thermopower becomes positive after a while .",
    "similar conclusions hold for the largest driving amplitude of 3.0@xmath41 except for the fact that the instantaneous thermopower dips lower into negative territory since the dot energy level manages to get even closer to the fermi level hence the kondo resonance is more developed .",
    "the saturation behaviour of the time averaged thermopower at low driving frequencies is also closely related to the development of the kondo resonance .",
    "as the driving frequency is lowered , dot energy level begins to spend more time near the fermi level .",
    "this in turn gives the kondo resonance more time to develop since its full formation takes considerable amount of time @xcite .",
    "consequently , time averaged thermopower values start to increase in negative territory .",
    "when the driving frequency is lowered below a certain value , we observe that the time averaged thermopower saturates .",
    "this is simply because the dot level is allocated sufficient time in the vicinity of fermi level anymore .",
    "dependence of the time averaged thermopower curves to ambient temperature is quite interesting too and requires further elaboration .",
    "it is clear from both fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that the difference between the time averaged values obtained at the same driving frequency increases as the driving frequency is reduced until it stays constant below a certain frequency .",
    "this behaviour is further testimony to the crucial role development of the kondo resonance plays in thermopower . at elevated driving frequencies ,",
    "time averaged thermopower is not sensitive to ambient temperature because the dot level can not spend sufficient time near the fermi level .",
    "naturally , the kondo resonance can not be formed adequately hence a lack of sensitivity to ambient temperature .",
    "as the driving frequency is reduced , the difference becomes more pronounced and stays constant after the kondo resonance gets the chance to develop itself fully below a certain frequency .",
    "in conclusion , we studied in linear response both the instantaneous and time averaged values of thermopower for a quantum dot sinusoidally driven by a gate voltage .",
    "we found that the instantaneous thermopower exhibits complex fluctuations as the driving amplitude is ramped up .",
    "we interpreted the origin of dipping into negative territory as a sign of development of the kondo resonance at fermi level .",
    "we studied the behaviour of the time averaged thermopower as a function of inverse driving frequency and observed that it tends to saturate at low driving frequencies .",
    "moreover , the results depend on ambient temperature quite sensitively .",
    "we believe that the scenario we discussed in this paper has great potential to be realized experimentally .",
    "the temperature gradient between the contacts can be achieved with laser irradiation and the sinusoidal motion of the dot level can easily be realized with an ac gate voltage .",
    "we also think that state of the art ultrafast pump - probe techniques @xcite could make recording thermopower in real time possible .",
    "therefore , we hope to create motivation and experimental progress in this field with our novel results .",
