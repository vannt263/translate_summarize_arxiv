    "malignant gliomas are aggressive brain tumours typically associated with a poor prognosis , sharp deterioration in the patients quality of life and markedly low survival rates , making this disease a challenge to treat . according to the world health organization ( who ) @xcite",
    ", gliomas are classified into different categories varying from low - grade ( slow - growing ) to high - grade ( rapidly - growing ) tumours depending on their proliferative capacity and invasiveness , glioblastoma multiforme ( gbm ) being the most malignant form . despite advances in surgical and medical neuro - oncology @xcite ,",
    "complete tumour resection is unlikely and subsequent recurrence is almost inevitable .",
    "a major obstacle to cure this devastating type of brain tumours is attributed to its highly invasive nature .",
    "glioma cells have a remarkable capacity to infiltrate the surrounding normal brain tissue and migrate long distances from the tumour bed , which enables them to escape surgical resection , radiation exposure and chemotherapy @xcite . the persistently poor prognosis and high treatment failure rates demand more effective therapeutic strategies that should be based on a deeper mechanistic understanding of the key events triggering tumour invasion .    the influence of the microenvironment on the behaviour of glioma cells plays a crucial role in the resulting diffusive tumour growth and infiltration into the adjacent brain tissue .",
    "hypoxia , the presence of abnormal and sustained low oxygen levels in the tumour tissue , strongly correlates with glioma malignancy @xcite . at higher glioma cell densities ,",
    "tumours contain hypoxic regions with an inadequate oxygen supply due to tumour - induced vascular abnormalities . under such oxygen - limiting conditions ,",
    "glioma cells develop a wide variety of rescue mechanisms to survive and sustain proliferation . these include recruitment of new blood vessels driven by secretion of pro - angiogenic factors , modulations of cell oxygen consumption and activation of cellular migratory mechanisms to escape from poorly oxygenated regions @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ability of glioma cells to switch phenotype in response to metabolic stress may have important implications for tumour progression and resistance to therapies .",
    "for instance , the mutually exclusive switching between proliferative and migratory phenotypes experimentally observed , and known as the migration / proliferation dichotomy ( or go - or - grow mechanism ) , is considered to significantly increase invasiveness in response to low oxygen levels @xcite .",
    "however , how the dynamical interplay between glioma cells and their microenvironment leads to development of hypoxic regions , as well as their global impact on glioma invasion are still not fully understood .",
    "a particularly important component of the tumour microenvironment is the vasculature .",
    "there exist various positive and negative feedback mechanisms between glioma cells and the vasculature .",
    "gliomas are reported as highly vascularised neoplasias @xcite , where excessive vascularisation is induced by a wide range of pro - angiogenic factors @xcite . however , over - expression of pro - angiogenic factors produced by hypoxic glioma cells is commonly observed and results in local vascular hyperplasia with defective blood vessels .",
    "such morphological abnormalities in the vasculature are a common feature of gliomas , where blood vessels have significantly larger diameters and thicker basement membranes than those in normal brain tissue @xcite , see figure  [ fig1](a , b ) .",
    "moreover , vaso - occlusive events have been reported to initiate a hypoxia / necrosis cycle influencing the dynamical balance between migration and proliferation of glioma cells .",
    "in fact , different pathological and experimental observations suggest that vaso - occlusion could readily explain the rapid peripheral expansion and diffusely infiltrative growth behaviour of malignant gliomas @xcite",
    ". blood vessel occlusion can mainly occur due to increased mechanical pressure exerted on them by tumour cells or induced by intravascular pro - thrombotic mechanisms @xcite , see figure  [ fig1](c , d ) .",
    "occluded or collapsed blood vessels induce perivascular tumour hypoxia and favour glioma cell migration towards better oxygenated regions .",
    "this fact has been linked to waves of hypoxic glioma cells actively migrating away from oxygen - deficient regions leading to pseudopalisade formation @xcite .",
    "since hypoxia - induced migration is recognised to support further neoplastic dissemination , investigating the overall effect of vaso - modulatory interventions on the tumour front speed and infiltration width turns crucial .",
    "the high degree of angiogenesis and vascular pathologies observed in malignant gliomas have been the target of several vaso - modulatory strategies @xcite .",
    "current clinical and preclinical findings suggest that angiogenesis inhibitors alone , with the potential to starve glioma cells , have limited efficacy in terms of tumour shrinkage , functional vasculature destruction and patient survival @xcite .",
    "furthermore , anti - angiogenic factors as inhibitors of neovascularisation are also restricted by transient effects and development of therapy resistance @xcite .",
    "instead , improved tumour vascularisation , either via normalisation or due to a stress alleviation strategy based on reopening compressed blood vessels , is an emerging concept expected to reduce tumour hypoxia , improve perfusion and enhance the delivery of cytotoxic drugs and radiotherapy efficacy @xcite .",
    "recent evidences indicate that judicious application of an anti - angiogenic therapy may normalise the structure and function of tumour vasculature @xcite , where potential benefits are schedule- and patient - dependent @xcite .",
    "although vasculature - targeting interventions could provide therapeutic benefits , further mechanistic insights into glioma invasion responses are still needed to improve treatment outcomes and patient survival @xcite .",
    "in this work , we propose a mathematical model of reaction - diffusion type that is based on well - supported biological assumptions for the growth of vascularised gliomas .",
    "in particular , we focus on the interplay between the migration / proliferation dichotomy of glioma cells and modulations of functional tumour vasculature .",
    "mathematical modelling has the potential to improve our understanding of the complex biology of tumours and their interactions with the microenvironment , as well as may help to design more effective and personalised therapeutic strategies @xcite .",
    "several mathematical models have been developed to identify mechanisms that facilitate proliferation and migration of glioma cells @xcite , see also @xcite for reviews .",
    "most of these models have been formulated to study glioma invasion based exclusively on cell diffusion and proliferation rates @xcite . among modelling results ,",
    "interpretation of glioma growth patterns compared to clinical data @xcite , as well as plausible predictions of the success or failure of different treatment techniques have been reported @xcite .",
    "recently , different models including the influence of tumour microenvironmental conditions such as hypoxia , necrosis and angiogenesis have been developed @xcite .",
    "however , the role of vaso - occlusion in glioma invasion , considering the go - or - grow mechanism , has not been addressed so far .",
    "accordingly , we intend to generate insights into the effects of vaso - modulatory interventions on tumour front speed and infiltration width .",
    "the main aim is to use the better understanding to investigate the potential of personalised therapeutic protocols . to that end ,",
    "we begin by defining the biological assumptions taken into account when developing our glioma - vasculature interplay model .",
    "we then investigate the effect of modulations of cell oxygen consumption and vaso - occlusion rates in glioma invasion .",
    "we show that one - size - fits - all vaso - modulatory interventions should be expected to fail to control glioma growth and lead to a trade - off between tumour front speed and infiltration width .",
    "the model results provide a better understanding of glioma - microenvironment interactions , and it is therefore suited for analysing the potential success or failure of vaso - modulatory treatment strategies . we conclude with a discussion of the main implications of our model results in designing novel personalised therapeutic protocols .",
    "the mathematical model we develop describes the growth of vascularised gliomas focusing on the interplay between the migration / proliferation dichotomy and vaso - occlusion at the margin of viable tumour tissue .",
    "the system variables are density of glioma cells @xmath0 and functional tumour vasculature @xmath1 , as well as concentrations of oxygen @xmath2 and pro - angiogenic factors @xmath3 in the tumour microenvironment , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the dimension of the system .",
    "figure  [ fig2](a ) shows a diagram of the system interactions / assumptions considered , which are summarised as follows : + * [ a1 ] * glioma cells switch phenotypes between proliferative ( normoxic ) and migratory ( hypoxic ) depending on the oxygen concentration in the tumour microenvironment @xcite . + * [ a2 ] * under hypoxia conditions glioma cells secrete large amounts of pro - angiogenic factors @xcite . + * [ a3 ] * pro - angiogenic factors drive new blood vessel formation and vasculature remodelling @xcite . + * [ a4 ] * endothelial cells uptake pro - angiogenic factors @xcite . + * [ a5 ] * functional tumour - associated vasculature releases oxygen @xcite . + * [ a6 ] * oxygen availability is essential for glioma growth and progression @xcite .",

    "the model accounts for the dynamics of normoxic and hypoxic glioma cells based on the go - or - grow mechanism and influenced by the functional tumour - associated vasculature , as well as concentrations of pro - angiogenic factors and oxygen in the tumour microenvironment . specifically , we focused on the effects of cell oxygen consumption and vascular modulations on relevant properties of glioma invasion , i.e. tumour front speed and infiltration width .",

    "microenvironment decreases which limits cell proliferation and enhances hypoxia - induced migration . however , the extent to which such oxygen - mediated cell responses to vasculature - targeting treatment interventions influence glioma invasion depends on the specific intrinsic tumour features .",
    "modulations of the functional tumour - associated vasculature reveals the existence of a critical cell proliferation / diffusion ratio for glioma invasion responses , see figure  [ fig5](b ) .",
    "this fact is observed for gliomas evolving with sufficiently high cell proliferation rates for variations in the oxygen concentration , due to vaso - occlusion or normalisation , significantly influences tumour cell dynamics . in such cases , tumour vascular modulations",
    "are predicted to produce opposing effects on front speed and infiltration width .",
    "moreover , we found that depending on the intrinsic tumour features two distinct regimes can be identified where invasive behaviours in responses to vaso - modulatory interventions are different .",
    "a pro - thrombotic treatment is predicted to increase front speeds , but in turn reduces infiltration capacity of gliomas characterised by a cell proliferation / diffusion ratio below the critical threshold . on the contrary , gliomas in the other regime under the same treatment strategy",
    "become increasingly infiltrative and slowly growing .",
    "analogously , vascular normalisation therapies produce opposing results for the corresponding parameter regimes .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the migration / proliferation dichotomy introduces a critical glioma cell density threshold separating tumour growth and extinction dynamics , a phenomenon called allee effect @xcite . here",
    ", we also identify critical parameter values that distinguish different glioma invasive behaviours with respect to variations of cell oxygen consumption or vaso - occlusion .",
    "interestingly , this is an emergent consequence of the go - or - grow plasticity , since in its absence ( see _ model i _ ) no critical behaviour is observed . assuming or not tumour vasculature dynamics , the go - or - grow induced criticality is expressed either in the form of a critical intrinsic proliferation / diffusion ratio @xmath123 or an intrinsic proliferation rate @xmath124 , respectively , see figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "this result highlights the importance of further investigating the clinical effects of the go - or - grow phenomenon on glioma invasion .    the above _ in silico _",
    "findings demonstrate that _ one - size - fits - all _ vaso - modulatory interventions should be expected to fail to control glioma invasion due to the complexity of the involved mechanisms and the heterogeneity of patient- and tumour - related factors .",
    "this study proves the value of personalised treatment strategies based on a precise tumour profiling and provides a modelling framework with the potential to parametrise model predictions based on biopsy measurements .",
    "in particular , individual estimation of intrinsic proliferation and diffusion rates , for instance via biopsy tumour sample analysis , would be crucial components of such future tailored approaches to personalised glioma therapy .",
    "moreover , this work substantially expands the current theoretical concepts in glioma invasion , showing that any vasculature - targeting therapeutic intervention will inevitably lead to a trade - off between tumour front speed and infiltration width .",
    "this finding suggests that vaso - modulatory therapies should be embedded in personalised combination therapy regimens , in which anti - angiogenesis might be integrated with individually adjusted other modules targeting proliferation , metabolism or tumour immunology .",
    "for instance , in the case of gliomas characterised by a high intrinsic proliferation / diffusion ratio , a pro - thrombotic or an anti - vasogenic treatment technique may reduce tumour invasion speed , but at the same time leads to highly infiltrative responses that makes this therapeutic strategy rather inappropriate .",
    "however , selecting a blood vessel normalisation strategy results in faster growing gliomas as a bulk with less - infiltrating morphologies .",
    "thus , surgical resection could be considered to remove such compact tumours . in turn",
    ", the benefits of conventional treatments such as chemotherapy , radiotherapy and immunotherapy might increase in better - vascularised tumours @xcite .",
    "therefore , an accurate glioma patient stratification during clinical decision - making is predicted relevant for the efficacy of vasculature - targeting therapies , based on either tumour - associated blood vessel deterioration or normalisation .    this work provides a mathematical framework for exploring novel approaches to rational combination therapies or regimens composed of subsequent periods of vaso - modulatory interventions and potentially other therapeutic modules . in our model",
    "the vaso - occlusion term is rather phenomenological and more accurate modelling is required .",
    "furthermore , the migration / proliferation dichotomy has been modelled in the simplest possible way and more informed models could be integrated . in turn , intra - tumour genetic diversity is not directly considered , but we take into account phenotypic diversity depending on the oxygen availability , that is crucial for therapeutic outcomes . the latter is supported by evidences that genetic diversity is tumour - subtype specific and not significantly affected during treatment , while phenotypic heterogeneity is different before and after therapy @xcite . despite the fact that the model involves a large number of model parameters , their values were defined independently from each other based on published experimental data . for those parameters",
    "estimated , a parametric analysis was performed and we concluded that variations of their values do not affect the general conclusions of this study . at this stage , we restrict the modelling strategy to the effects of vasculature - targeting therapies , however , we are aware of the fact that further aspects of tumour biology may play a crucial role .",
    "in fact , we aim to investigate the interactions between the immune system and angiogenesis as an additional level of complexity given the potential success of immunomodulatory therapies . in particular , macrophages are likely to be involved in relevant mechanisms and will be included in future developments of the current approach .",

    "<S> in contrast , the therapeutic intention of normalising the abnormal structure and function of tumour vascular networks , e.g. via alleviating stress - induced vaso - occlusion , is to improve chemo- , immuno- and radiation therapy efficacy . </S>",
    "<S> although both strategies have shown therapeutic potential , it remains unclear why they often fail to control glioma invasion into the surrounding healthy brain tissue . to shed light on this issue </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a mathematical model of glioma invasion focusing on the interplay between the migration / proliferation dichotomy ( go - or - grow ) of glioma cells and modulations of the functional tumour vasculature . </S>",
    "<S> vaso - modulatory interventions are modelled by varying the degree of vaso - occlusion . </S>",
    "<S> we discovered the existence of a critical cell proliferation / diffusion ratio that separates glioma invasion responses to vaso - modulatory interventions into two distinct regimes . </S>",
    "<S> while for tumours , belonging to one regime , vascular modulations reduce the tumour front speed and increase the infiltration width , for those in the other regime the invasion speed increases and infiltration width decreases . </S>",
