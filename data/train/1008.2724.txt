    "currently , the concept of slow - roll inflation is widely accepted by cosmologists , due to many precise observations , such as the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap)@xcite .",
    "we can explain all observations simply , using single field slow - roll inflation .",
    "however , future observations might detect non - standard signals , which will be evidence for a non - standard inflationary theory .",
    "the energy scale of inflation is considered to be very high compared to current experimental scale .",
    "thus , we can say that a new inflationary theory might contain information with regard to high energy physics , such as a superstring theory .",
    "therefore it is important to study theories beyond standard single field slow - roll inflation .",
    "one of candidates for a modified inflationary model is inflation with the gauss - bonnet and chern - simons corrections .",
    "these are the only two meaningful combinations of second order curvature terms , as a low energy effective theory@xcite , and can also be derived from some superstring models@xcite .",
    "cosmology with the gauss - bonnet term can affect background evolution and result in a non - singular cosmological model@xcite or other interesting solutions@xcite .",
    "in inflation with the chern - simons term , primordial gravitational waves are circularly polarized@xcite , which is considered as an interesting target for some future observations@xcite .",
    "many authors studied gauss - bonnet and chern - simons modified inflation . however , _ slow - roll _ inflation with the gauss - bonnet terms is not much studied , except in the papers@xcite . taking current observations into consideration , slow - roll inflation is the most plausible paradigm for inflation . therefore investigating slow - roll inflation with the",
    "gauss - bonnet and chern - simons corrections is an important subject .",
    "we have studied this topic in the previous paper@xcite . in this paper , we re - formalize slow - roll inflation in gravity with the gauss - bonnet and chern - simons corrections .",
    "we derive formulas for the observables , namely the scalar spectral index @xmath7 , the tensor spectral index @xmath8 , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath9 and the circular polarization ratio @xmath10 , in our inflationary model .",
    "the gauss - bonnet term violates the consistency relation @xmath0 .",
    "we show if this violation is observationally confirmed , the derivative of the gauss - bonnet coupling function at the observation scale , namely the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) scale , is fixed .",
    "we study the two typical cases , blue and scale invariant spectra of tensor modes . because blue and scale invariant mean @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively",
    ", these cases strongly violate this consistency relation .",
    "if these are confirmed in future observations , the gauss - bonnet coupling function must be @xmath3 , at the cmb scale . of course",
    ", even if no such effects are observed in future , we can get the constraint @xmath11 , at least . however , it is unclear whether these interesting cases are consistent with current observations . therefore , we perform calculations in some concrete examples .",
    "we show new - inflation - type potential with symmetry breaking scale of @xmath4 leads to an observationally consistent blue spectrum ; potential with flat region in @xmath12 leads to a consistent scale invariant spectrum . in both cases ,",
    "the almost constant @xmath13 is required .",
    "the chern - simons term leads to circular polarization of gravitational waves .",
    "we show if this circular polarization is detected , we can fix the derivative of the chern - simons coupling function , at the cmb scale",
    ". it might be @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the value of the gauss - bonnet and chern - simons coupling functions at the cmb scale will be fixed , or constrained , with future observations .",
    "we organize this paper as follows : in section ii , the action we considered is shown and slow - roll inflation in this action is studied , calculations of perturbations in slow - roll inflation is in section iii , interesting features of our model are mentioned in section iv , and section v is for conclusion .",

    "hence , the chern - simons correction represents parity violation in gravity .",
    "this action is composed of the einstein - hilbert term and a canonical scalar field which couples to the gauss - bonnet and chern - simons terms through the coupling functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "note that only these two types of higher curvature corrections , namely the gauss - bonnet and chern - simons terms , are essential as a low energy effective theory@xcite . here , we take these terms as small corrections . in principle , coupling functions must be fixed by quantum gravity , such as a superstring theory .",
    "however , it is impossible to determine these coupling functions , because we havent succeeded to construct quantum gravity .",
    "therefore , we treat these as free functions and attempt to fix or constrain these coupling functions from cosmological observations . through these attempts , we may get new information with regard to quantum gravity , because these coupling functions are related to properties of quantum gravity .    here , as a background metric",

    "variating eq.([s ] ) in the frw metric , eq.([frw ] ) , we get background equations : @xmath24 where a dot denotes a time derivative and the hubble parameter @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 .",
    "because of parity symmetry of eq.([frw ] ) , the chern - simons correction can not affect these background equations .",

    "the time derivative of the hubble parameter is small . in the case that @xmath47 can be treated as a constant , we can solve the equation for @xmath25 easily : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a constant of integration . because we choose @xmath59 , @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",

    "the chern - simons coupling function @xmath136 does nt appear in the background and scalar perturbations , but , at the same time , this appears in tensor perturbations , because _ circular _ modes clearly violate parity symmetry .    from eqs.([atct ] ) , we can see that if @xmath137 , @xmath134 takes a negative value in one of helicity modes at the cut - off scale @xmath138 .",

    "the detection of this blue signal might be evidence for this inflationary model , because @xmath172 is always satisfied in a conventional model .",
    "we have derived both scalar and tensor spectra .",

    "however , we can still expect @xmath10 is of order a few percent , which is considered to be observable in future experiments@xcite .",
    "note that we have got no observational constraint on @xmath136 and @xmath132 , because these only appear in tensor modes , which we havent detected .    in a conventional model , the transformation of potential @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is constant , has no effect on spectral indices , tensor - to - scalar ratio and e - folding number .",
    "hence , an overall factor of potential is fixed by the scalar power spectrum @xmath111 . in our model , from eqs.([slow - roll_param ] ) and ( [ e - fold_0 ] ) , it is clear that these observables depend on the transformation @xmath181 . in this case , the transformations which keep @xmath182 and @xmath39 constants are @xmath181 and @xmath183 .",
    "slow - roll inflation in the gauss - bonnet modified gravity violates the consistency relation @xmath184 .",
    "however , in the case of standard multi field inflation , this relation also modified as @xmath175 .",
    "therefore , the case of over production of gravitational waves , @xmath185 , is important . from eqs.([ntex ] ) and ( [ rex ] ) , we can see over - production is realized if @xmath186 is satisfied .",
    "taking a look at the definition of slow - roll parameters and @xmath36 , eqs.([slow - roll_param ] ) and ( [ def_zeta ] ) , we can see in the situation that @xmath187 is realized , gravitational waves will always be overly produced .",
    "thus , we can expect over production in many models .",
    "if the violation of this relation is observationally confirmed , we can reconstruct the value of the derivative of the gauss - bonnet coupling function @xmath13 . from eqs.([slow - roll_param ] ) @xmath188 the potential @xmath189 and the slow - roll parameter @xmath48 are related by the scalar power spectrum @xmath111 . from eq.([psex ] ) @xmath190 hence , @xmath13 is written as @xmath191 let us parameterize the violation ratio of consistency relation by using @xmath192 : @xmath193 the expression for @xmath13 becomes @xmath194",

    "particularly , the model which overly produce tensor modes exists@xcite .",

    "next , let us study the chern - simons coupling function .",
    "considering future observations , deriving the expression for @xmath201 by using observable is meaningful . from the definition of @xmath132 , eq.([def_omega ] ) , @xmath201 is @xmath202 thus , we can see that for confirming existence of the chern - simons term , it is important to detect circular polarization in tensor modes .",
    "we can also use this expression to predict this polarization ratio . because @xmath203 is required by the definition , eq.([def_pi ] ) , we can get the constraint on the value of @xmath201 : @xmath204    of course , if we allow an appearance of ghost in tensor modes , a situation might be changed drastically . however , it exceeds the scope of this paper .      here , we comment on the lyth bound@xcite .",
    "the statement of this bound is following : if primordial gravitational waves are detected , the variation of inflaton field must exceed a scale on the order of planck mass .",
    "in our model , this bound also holds . from eq.([e - fold_0 ] ) @xmath205 and @xmath206 this can be easily understood : large @xmath9 corresponds to small @xmath53 , and this leads to small @xmath207 .",
    "note that effect of gravitational waves on the cmb multi pole is relevant in approximately @xmath208 , which corresponds to @xmath209 .",
    "this means that if gravitational waves with tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath9 are observed , the field value of inflaton has changed its value approximately @xmath210 during @xmath209 .",
    "hence , from this equation , we can set the lower bound on variation of inflaton field @xmath211 during whole inflation : @xmath212 we can see that the lyth bound holds in our case , while an equation of motion is modified due to the gauss - bonnet correction .",
    "therefore , extremely small field inflation , namely @xmath213 , can not produce an observable amount of tensor modes .",
    "in our model , a spectrum of primordial gravitational waves can be blue or scale invariant , and these cases strongly violate the consistency relation @xmath0 .",
    "hence , these ( especially , a blue spectrum ) are important for confirming our model with future observations . in this section ,",
    "we use concrete examples to check these interesting situations are consistent with the current wmap result .",
    "we show characteristics of potential and the gauss - bonnet coupling function which realize a blue or scale invariant spectrum .",
    "we also consider the case in which potential is cancelled out by the gauss - bonnet effective potential .",
    "we take e - folding number as @xmath214 for calculations in examples .",
    "the most interesting and unique phenomenon in our model might be a blue spectrum of tensor modes .",
    "note that it is impossible to achieve a blue spectrum in a conventional model . for achieving a blue spectrum ,",
    "@xmath63 is required .",
    "hence @xmath215 is necessary because @xmath27 . in a case of blue spectrum",
    ", a scalar field is climbing up potential , not rolling down .",
    "of course , this blue situation must be over at some time , or inflation lasts forever , because @xmath64 is satisfied in this blue case .",

    "we show this in fig.[blue ] .     and the coupling function @xmath35 , which achieve a blue spectrum , is shown .",

    "hence , there is a necessary condition for a blue spectrum : @xmath217 and combining with eq.([v_o ] ) @xmath218 remember @xmath219 and @xmath220 . to observe tensor modes",
    ", @xmath9 can not take an extremely small value .",
    "hence , @xmath192 can not exceed a value of order unity and @xmath221 must hold . in a consistent blue spectrum case , hence , we need the derivative of the gauss - bonnet coupling function @xmath13 on the order of @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "it is important that both too small and too large a value of @xmath13 can not result in a desirable blue spectrum . in other words ,",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ] @xmath362    in @xmath301 models , trajectories approach to some points for each @xmath294 in large @xmath293 limit , in fig.[trjflat ] .",
    "this is understood from eq.([e - fold_0 ] ) . in the large @xmath293 limit of @xmath301 models ,",
    "only a large @xmath77 region contribute to the integration for an e - folding number . because @xmath363 in this region , we can omit @xmath364 term : @xmath365 this shows that , in this large @xmath293 limit , @xmath13 approaches to @xmath366 .",
    "this also fixes the value of @xmath200 and all slow - roll parameters .",
    "the observables @xmath7 and @xmath9 become @xmath367 hence , trajectories approach to some points in large @xmath293 .",
    "this shows that @xmath368 model leads to very small @xmath9 because @xmath9 approaches to @xmath369 at @xmath370 .    from above results",
    ", we can say that an observationally consistent flat spectrum can be obtained . hence , confirming existence of the gauss - bonnet term is possible , with observing a scale invariant tensor mode . in the cases we considered ,",
    "@xmath371 and nearly constant @xmath13 might lead to a consistent flat spectrum .",
    "note that @xmath234 denotes the difference between the filed value of a flat region and the vacuum of potential .",
    "we can expect these conditions are also satisfied in many other cases . to realize a flat spectrum , @xmath3 is necessary in any model .      as mentioned in the end of section [ sec_slow - roll ] ,",
    "if we take @xmath372 , potential is cancelled out by the gauss - bonnet effective potential .",
    "considering this fact , let us take @xmath35 as follows : @xmath373 where @xmath374 is a constant and we assume @xmath375 .",
    "the function @xmath36 becomes @xmath376 eq.([dphizeta ] ) becomes @xmath377 hence if @xmath378 is realized , a scalar field always rolls up potential toward a hill - top .",
    "this is not a desirable situation .",
    "therefore we take @xmath379 .",
    "slow - roll parameters becomes @xmath380 where we used @xmath381 . in this case",
    ", @xmath48 becomes negligible .",
    "note if the gauss - bonnet term is dominating , @xmath47 becomes negligible . in this case , the observables @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are @xmath382 because the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath9 is zero , the value of the spectral index @xmath8 is meaningless .",
    "therefore observationally speaking , this situation is not interesting .",
    "however , because @xmath383 , three slow - roll conditions are automatically satisfied . hence , even if we use extremely steep potential , inflation can be achieved .",
    "in this paper , we studied slow - roll inflation with the gauss - bonnet and chern - simons corrections .",
    "we defined three slow - roll parameters , while we used five parameters in the previous paper@xcite .",
    "we derived expressions for the scalar spectral index @xmath7 , the tensor spectral index @xmath8 , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath9 and the circular polarization ratio @xmath10 by using these parameters .",
    "we showed that in our model , the consistency relation @xmath0 is not automatically satisfied .",
    "if this violation is observationally confirmed , we can determine the derivative of the gauss - bonnet coupling function @xmath13 at the cmb scale . in our model ,",
    "even both blue and scale invariant spectra of gravitational waves can be realized .",
    "because blue and scale invariant mean @xmath1 and @xmath384 , respectively , these cases violate this consistency relation strongly .",
    "therefore these are the key for confirming our model in future observations .",
    "we showed that if either a blue spectrum or a scale invariant one is observed , it supports existence of the gauss - bonnet coupling function of @xmath350 at the cmb scale .",
    "we checked whether or not these blue and scale invariant spectra are consistent with current observations .",
    "for this purpose , we used concrete examples .",
    "we showed that new - inflation - type potential with @xmath4 symmetry breaking scale and potential with flat region in @xmath12 might result in observationally consistent blue and scale invariant spectra , respectively .",
    "an almost linear form of the gauss - bonnet coupling function is appropriate in both cases .",
    "these tell us that the detection of a blue or scale invariant spectrum of tensor modes can be actually expected with future observations .",
    "we also showed that if circular polarization of gravitational waves is detected , the derivative of the chern - simons coupling @xmath201 must be on the order of @xmath222 .",
    "thus , we can say that existence of gravitational higher coupling terms in a inflationary model will be confirmed , or at least constrained , with future experiments .",
    "these higher curvature terms are expected to appear in non - gaussian part of perturbations .",
    "therefore , calculating non - gaussianity in our model is important future work .",
