    "the investigations of the exact special solutions of nonintegrable systems play an important role in the study of nonlinear physical phenomena .",
    "there are a few methods to construct such solutions  @xcite in terms of rational , hyperbolic , trigonometric or elliptic functions .",
    "these methods use the results of the painlev test , describing behavior of solutions in the neighbourhood of their singular points , but do not use local solutions obtained as the laurent series . in 2003",
    "r.  conte and m.  musette  @xcite have proposed the method , which uses such solutions .",
    "this method constructs global single - valued solutions in two steps .",
    "the first step is construction of the local special solutions as the laurent series .",
    "the second step is construction of the first order polynomial autonomous differential equations which have the same laurent series solutions .",
    "the general solutions of these equations are special solutions of the initial system . in this paper",
    "we present the computer algebra program , which realizes this method .",
    "when we study some mechanical problem the time is assumed to be real , whereas the integrability of motion equations is connected with the behavior of their solutions as functions of complex time .",
    "solutions of a system of ordinary differential equations ( ode s ) are regarded as analytic functions , maybe with isolated singular points . a singular point of a solution",
    "critical _ ( as opposed to _ noncritical _ ) if the solution is multivalued ( single - valued ) in its neighbourhood and _ movable _ if its location depends on initial conditions  @xcite . _ the general solution _ of an ode of order @xmath0 is the set of all solutions mentioned in the existence theorem of cauchy , i.e. determined by the initial values .",
    "it depends on @xmath0 arbitrary independent constants .",
    "_ a special solution _ is any solution obtained from the general solution by giving values to the arbitrary constants . _",
    "a singular solution _ is any solution which is not special , i.e. which does not belong to the general solution .",
    "a system of ode s has * _ the painlev property _ * if its general solution has no movable critical singular point  @xcite .    * _ the painlev test _ * is any algorithm , which checks some necessary conditions for a differential equation to have the painlev property .",
    "the original algorithm , developed by p.  painlev and used by him to find all the second order ode s with painlev property , is known as the @xmath1-method .",
    "the method of s.v .",
    "kovalevskaya  @xcite is not as general as the @xmath1method , but much more simple .",
    "the remarkable property of this test is that it can be checked in a finite number of steps .",
    "this test can only detect the occurrence of logarithmic and algebraic branch points .",
    "to date there is no general finite algorithmic method to detect the occurrence of essential singularities . in 1980 , developing the kovalevskaya method further , m.j .",
    "ablowitz , a.  ramani and h.  segur  @xcite constructed a new algorithm of the painlev test for ode s .",
    "this algorithm appears very useful to find solutions as a formal laurent series .",
    "first of all , it allows to determine the dominant behavior of a solution in the neighbourhood of the singular point @xmath2 . if the solution tends to infinity as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a negative integer number , then substituting the laurent series expansions one can transform nonlinear differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations on coefficients of the laurent series .",
    "all solutions of an autonomous system depend on the parameter @xmath2 , which characterizes the singular point location .",
    "if a single - valued solution depends on other parameters , then some coefficients of its laurent series have to be arbitrary and the corresponding systems have to have zero determinants .",
    "the numbers of such systems ( named _ resonances _ or _ kovalevskaya exponents _ ) can be determined due to the painlev test .    in  @xcite the following classical results",
    "have been used to construct the suitable form of the first order autonomous equation :    \\1 .",
    "the painlev theorem  @xcite .",
    "solutions of the equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a polynomial in both @xmath7 and @xmath8 has no movable essential singular point .",
    "\\2 . the fuchs theorem  @xcite .",
    "if the equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 are polynomials in @xmath7 and analytic functions in @xmath11 , has no critical movable singular points , then the power of @xmath12 is no more than @xmath13 , in particular , @xmath14 is a constant .",
    "therefore , the necessary form of a polynomial autonomous first order ode with the single - valued general solution is @xmath15 in which @xmath16 is a positive integer number and @xmath17 are constants .",
    "\\3 . the briot and bouquet theorem  @xcite .",
    "if the general solution of a polynomial autonomous first order ode is single - valued , then this solution is either an elliptic function , or a rational function of @xmath18 , @xmath19 being some constant , or a rational function of @xmath20 .",
    "note that the third case is a degeneracy of the second one , which in its turn is a degeneracy of the first one .",
    "to analyze the method of the laurent series solutions construction let us consider the generalized hnon ",
    "heiles system with an additional non - polynomial term , which is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath21 and the corresponding system of the motion equations : @xmath22   \\displaystyle   y_{tt}^{\\vphantom{7 } } { } = { } -\\lambda_2 y -x^2+cy^2 , \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\eqno(2)\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are arbitrary numerical parameters .",
    "note that if @xmath29 , then one can put @xmath30 without loss of generality . if @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , then @xmath35 is the initial hnon  heiles system  @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath36 , solution of system  @xmath35 , satisfies the following fourth - order equation , which does not include @xmath27 : @xmath37 we note that the energy of the system @xmath38 is not an arbitrary parameter , but a function of initial data : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the form of this function depends on @xmath27 : @xmath43    this formula is correct only if @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath45 , what is possible only at @xmath34 , then we can not express @xmath46 through @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , so @xmath38 is not a function of the initial data . if @xmath47 , then eq .",
    "@xmath48 with an arbitrary @xmath38 corresponds to system @xmath35 with @xmath34 , in opposite case eq .",
    "@xmath48 does not correspond to system @xmath35 .    the painlev test of eq .",
    "@xmath48 gives the following dominant behaviors and resonance structures near the singular point @xmath2 :    * 1 .",
    "* the function @xmath36 tends to infinity as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",
    "* 2 . * for @xmath50 ( _",
    "case 1 _ ) the values of resonances are @xmath52    in _ case 2 _ ( @xmath51 ) @xmath53    the resonance @xmath54 corresponds to an arbitrary parameter @xmath2",
    ". other values of @xmath55 determine powers of @xmath11 ( their values are @xmath56 ) , at which new arbitrary parameters can appear as solutions of the linear systems with zero determinant . for integrability of system",
    "@xmath35 all values of @xmath55 have to be integer and all systems with zero determinants have to have solutions at any values of free parameters included in them .",
    "it is possible only in integrable cases .    for the search for special solutions , it is interesting to consider such values of @xmath28 , for which @xmath55 are integer numbers either only in _ case 1 _ or only in _",
    "case 2_. if there exist negative integer resonances , different from @xmath54 , then such laurent series expansion corresponds rather to singular than general solution .",
    "we demand that all values of @xmath55 , but one , are nonnegative integer numbers and all these values are different . from these conditions",
    "we obtain the following values of @xmath28 :  @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( _ case 1 _ ) , or @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( _ case 2 _ , @xmath62 ) , and also @xmath63 , in which these two _ cases _ coincide .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite ( for @xmath34 ) and  @xcite ( for an arbitrary value of @xmath27 ) that single - valued three - parameter special solutions exist in two nonintegrable cases : @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 are arbitrary ) .    when the resonance structure is known it is easy to write the computer algebra program , which finds the laurent series solutions with an arbitrary accuracy .",
    "for example , we have found 65 coefficients of the laurent series for both above - mentioned values of @xmath28 , the sizes of the corresponding output files are about 10 mb .      we have found local single - valued solutions .",
    "of course , the existence of local single - valued solutions is a necessary , but not a sufficient condition for the existence of global ones , because solutions , which are single - valued in the neighbourhood of one singular point , can be multivalued in the neighbourhood of another singular point .",
    "so , we can only assume that global three - parameter solutions are single - valued .",
    "if we assume this and moreover that these solutions are elliptic functions ( or some degenerations of them ) , then we can seek them as solutions of some polynomial first order equations .    the classical method to find special analytic solutions for the generalized hnon ",
    "heiles system is the following :    \\1 ) transform system ( 2 ) into eq .",
    "@xmath48 .",
    "\\2 ) assume that @xmath36 satisfies some first order equation , substitute this equation in ( 3 ) and obtain a nonlinear algebraic system .",
    "\\3 ) solve the obtained system .",
    "the second way proposed by r.  conte and m.  musette , is the following :    \\1 ) choose a positive integer @xmath16 and define the first order ode ( 6 ) , which contains unknown constants @xmath17 .",
    "\\2 ) compute coefficients of the laurent series solutions for  @xmath35 or @xmath48 with some fixed @xmath28 .",
    "the number of coefficients has to be greater than the number of unknowns .",
    "\\3 ) substituting the obtained coefficients , transform eq .",
    "@xmath66 into a linear and overdetermined system in @xmath17 with coefficients depending on arbitrary parameters .",
    "\\4 ) eliminate the @xmath17 and obtain the nonlinear system in five parameters .",
    "\\5 ) solve the obtained system .    to obtain the explicit form of the elliptic function , which satisfies the known first order ode , one can use the classical method due to poincar , which has been implemented in maple  @xcite as the package `` algcurves ''  @xcite .",
    "the second way has a few preferences .",
    "the first preference is that one does not need to transform system  @xmath35 to one differential equation either in @xmath36 or in @xmath20 .",
    "moreover at @xmath59 not @xmath20 , but @xmath67 may be an elliptic function . to construct the laurent series for @xmath67 is easier than to find the fourth order equation in @xmath67",
    "the main preference of the second method is that the number of unknowns in the resulting algebraic system does not depend on number of coefficients of the first order equation .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath68 with @xmath69 includes 60 unknowns @xmath17 , and it is not possible to use the first way to find similar solutions . using the second method",
    "we obtain ( independently of the value of @xmath16 ) a nonlinear algebraic system in five variables : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath38 and two arbitrary coefficients of the laurent - series solutions .",
    "the first way also has one important preference .",
    "it allows to obtain solutions for an arbitrary @xmath28 , whereas using the second method one has to fix value of @xmath28 to construct the laurent series solutions , because the resonance structure depends on @xmath28 .",
    "let us consider computer algebra procedures , which assist to construct the first order equation in the form @xmath70 with the given laurent - series solutions : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is some integer number .",
    "we can eliminate from eq .",
    "@xmath70 terms more singular than  @xmath73 : @xmath74 at singular points @xmath73 tends to infinity as @xmath75 , so we can present @xmath76 as the laurent series , beginning from this term : @xmath77 and transform @xmath78 in overdetermined algebraic system : @xmath79 in @xmath80 . we choose @xmath81 to be more than the number of coefficients @xmath80 .",
    "the maple procedures , which make this transformation are presented in appendix .",
    "the trivial variant is the following : procedure @xmath82 calculates the number of coefficients @xmath80 , procedure @xmath83 constructs the first order equation in the form ( 4 ) and procedure @xmath84 constructs the laurent series @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 should be more than @xmath82 .",
    "the first computer algebra realization , which generates only terms used in future , has been written in amp  @xcite by r.  conte .",
    "this algorithm bases on the @xmath1method of the painlev test .",
    "our realization bases on transformations of the laurent series and generates only useful terms as well .",
    "there exist maple  @xcite and reduce  @xcite realizations of our algorithm .",
    "the maple realization \\{procedure @xmath87 } is presented in appendix .",
    "let us consider how this procedure works .",
    "we put @xmath88 , other @xmath89 are unknown . the procedure @xmath87 does the following :    \\1 ) calculates @xmath90    \\2 ) constructs the list which corresponds to eq .",
    "@xmath85 : @xmath91 for example , if @xmath92 and @xmath93 we obtain @xmath94 , 0 , 0 ] , [ a[1,0 ] , 1 , 0 ] , [ a[2,0 ] , 2 , 0 ] , [ a[3,0 ] , 3 , 0 ] , [ a[0,1 ] , 0 , 1 ] , [ a[1,1 ] , 1 , 1 ] , [ 1 , 0 , 2]];\\ ] ]    \\3 ) to simplify the following procedures puts @xmath95    \\4 ) constructs the list of the laurent series coefficients of @xmath76 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "coefficient corresponding @xmath97 is constructed due to procedure @xmath98 as the sum of the corresponding coefficients of terms @xmath99y^jy_t^j$ ] .",
    "these coefficients are calculated by procedure @xmath100 , where @xmath101,i , j]$ ] .",
    "the obtained system is linear in @xmath99 $ ] and nonlinear in parameters of the laurent series .",
    "this system can be transformed into a nonlinear system in parameters of the laurent series , so the number of unknowns does not depend on @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting nonlinear system can be solved using the standard grbner basis method .",
    "the painlev test is a very useful tool to find single - valued solution .",
    "the corresponding computer algebra algorithm has been constructed in maple and reduce .",
    "the `` naive '' algorithm calculates many terms to be discarded on the following step .",
