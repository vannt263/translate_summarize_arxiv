    "in @xcite , we introduced a general method which assigns to any system of fields on cobordisms and system of action functionals on these fields a positive topological field theory ( tft ) . here",
    ", positivity refers to the fact that the state sum of such a theory takes values in a semiring , and is not definable over rings .",
    "thus positivity here does not refer to positivity of the associated hermitian pairing on the state modules in a unitary theory , as e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the reason why semirings are used is a fundamental discovery of eilenberg ( @xcite ) : certain semirings allow for an additive completeness that enables summation over families with large index sets .",
    "the so - called `` eilenberg - swindle '' shows that such a completeness can never hold in nontrivial rings . in @xcite",
    ", we also announced an application of the abstract framework to explicitly constructing a positive tft for all compact smooth manifolds in every dimension at least @xmath2 , which is capable of detecting exotic smooth structures . in the present paper , we carry out this construction in full detail . from now on , all manifolds are understood to be smooth .",
    "+ based on certain algebraic data , which are independent of any manifold and to be described more precisely below ,",
    "we first construct a commutative , eilenberg - complete monoid @xmath3 , which comes naturally equipped with two multiplications , yielding semirings @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the elements of @xmath3 are formal power series in one variable @xmath6 with coefficients in finite - dimensional matrices .",
    "the variable @xmath6 has the interpretation as a bookkeeping device for certain loops on cobordisms .",
    "given any integer @xmath7 we construct a theory @xmath8 with the following properties . to any closed @xmath9-manifold @xmath10 ( not necessarily orientable ) , we assign state - semimodules @xmath11 over @xmath12 .",
    "these are infinitely generated unless @xmath10 is empty .",
    "therefore , as in hilbert space theory , the algebraic tensor product is inadequate for describing the states of a disjoint union @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is another closed @xmath9-manifold .",
    "instead , using a suitably completed tensor product @xmath15 , we construct in proposition [ prop.zmonoidalonmodules ] an isomorphism @xmath16 diffeomorphisms @xmath17 induce isomorphisms @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath19 is another diffeomorphism , then the functoriality relation @xmath20 holds , as well as @xmath21 there is a contraction product @xmath22 which serves as a means of propagating states along cobordisms and uses the multiplication of @xmath4 . to any @xmath23-dimensional cobordism @xmath24 ( not necessarily orientable ) from @xmath10 to @xmath14 , we assign an element @xmath25 called the _ state sum _ of @xmath26 .",
    "technically , we work with embedded cobordisms , which is no loss of generality , but it needs to be investigated to what extent the state sum is independent of the embedding . let @xmath26 be a cobordism from @xmath10 to @xmath14 and @xmath27 a cobordism from @xmath28 to @xmath29 . if @xmath26 and @xmath27 are disjoint , then @xmath30 under the identification @xmath31 ( theorem [ thm.statesumdisjunion ] ) .",
    "the tensor product on the right hand side of the above equation of state sums uses the multiplication in @xmath5 .",
    "the most important characteristic of any tft is the gluing property .",
    "let @xmath27 be a cobordism from @xmath10 to @xmath14 and @xmath32 a cobordism from @xmath14 to @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 be the cobordism from @xmath10 to @xmath33 obtained by gluing @xmath27 and @xmath32 along @xmath14 .",
    "then the gluing theorem [ thm.gluingmain ] asserts that the state sums @xmath35 are related by the gluing law @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the above contraction product .",
    "the embedding of a cobordism gives in particular rise to a `` time '' function .",
    "we say that time on @xmath26 is _ progressive _ , if at every time @xmath38 , there is a point on @xmath26 at which the time function is submersive .",
    "let @xmath26 be a cobordism with progressive time from @xmath10 to @xmath14 and @xmath27 a cobordism with progressive time from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath39 be a diffeomorphism that maps @xmath10 to @xmath28 ( and thus @xmath14 to @xmath29 ) .",
    "we show in theorem [ thm.tcdiffeoinvariance ] that if @xmath40 extends to a time consistent diffeomorphism ( cf . definition [ def.timeconsistent ] ) @xmath41 , then the state sums of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are related by @xmath42 under the isomorphism @xmath43 in particular , the state sum can at most depend on the time function of the embedding , if at all .",
    "+ the value of the state sum @xmath44 on a given boundary condition lies in @xmath3 and hence is a power series in @xmath6 . in section [ sec.rationality ]",
    ", we prove that for cobordisms @xmath26 of dimension @xmath45 , this value is actually a rational function in @xmath6 ( theorem [ thm.rationalinq ] ) .",
    "moreover , the denominator is universal ( independent of @xmath26 ) , and hence all the information is contained in a polynomial in @xmath6 ( which does depend on the boundary conditions ) .",
    "+ it is not a priori clear that tfts are capable of recognizing exotic smooth structures .",
    "could it not be that the gluing law required of a tft trivializes the theory to such an extent , that it can not recognize the subtle global phenomenon of exotic smooth structures ?",
    "the present paper shows that this is not the case .",
    "recall that an _",
    "exotic sphere _ is a closed smooth @xmath23-dimensional manifold @xmath46 which is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the smooth standard sphere @xmath47 . for any smooth closed manifold @xmath48 @xmath49 homeomorphic to @xmath47",
    ", we define in section [ sec.exoticspheres ] an invariant @xmath50 and call it the _ aggregate invariant _ of @xmath10 .",
    "in fact we already showed in @xcite that , given any positive tft , this kind of invariant is always defined .",
    "it , too , uses eilenberg - completeness in an essential way and has no counterpart in classical tfts over rings .",
    "we prove that if @xmath51 @xmath49 is exotic , then @xmath52 in @xmath3 ( corollary [ cor.asigmanotasn ] ) .",
    "the proof relies on the work @xcite of o. saeki on cobordism of so - called special generic functions . in seeking a tft that can detect exotic spheres , one",
    "is initially encouraged by milnor s classical @xmath53-invariant ( @xcite ) in dimension @xmath54 .",
    "it is given on a closed oriented @xmath54-manifold @xmath10 by first choosing a compact , smooth , oriented manifold @xmath55 with @xmath56 ( always possible ) and then setting @xmath57 - \\sigma ( w)$ ] modulo @xmath54 , where @xmath58 $ ] is a pontrjagin number and @xmath59 is the signature of the intersection form .",
    "this residue class modulo @xmath54 is independent of the choice of @xmath26 by the hirzebruch signature theorem for closed manifolds . by novikov additivity",
    ", the signature always behaves like a tft .",
    "it turns out that the pontrjagin number is also additive , and thus behaves like a tft , _ provided _ @xmath60 . in fact , only under these assumptions is the pontrjagin number @xmath58 $ ] topologically well - defined .",
    "it follows that @xmath61 - \\sigma ( w ) \\in { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{z}}}$ ] transforms like a tft if @xmath62 .",
    "the problem is that pontrjagin numbers do not in general satisfy a gluing law : easy examples such as @xmath63 show that it may well be that @xmath34 has a nontrivial pontrjagin number , while the pontrjagin classes of @xmath27 and @xmath32 are trivial .",
    "this can also be understood from the analytic viewpoint : a choice of riemannian metric on @xmath26 determines an associated curvature two - form @xmath64 and , expressed in terms of @xmath64 , top - degree differential form representatives @xmath65 of polynomials in pontrjagin classes . by the additivity of integrals ,",
    "@xmath66 does of course satisfy a gluing law , but this integral is not topological . indeed , according to atiyah - patodi - singer @xcite ,",
    "if we use the hirzebruch @xmath67-polynomial , then @xmath66 is the sum of @xmath59 and the @xmath68-invariant of the boundary , at least when @xmath26 is isometric to a product near @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath68 invariant , however , is known to depend on the metric of the boundary .",
    "thus , at best , one would obtain a riemannian field theory , not a topological field theory .",
    "kreck , stolz and teichner informed us that using the work of galatius , madsen , tillmann and weiss ( @xcite ) , they obtained results on expressing pontrjagin numbers as partition functions of invertible tfts .",
    "witten s paper @xcite shows how exotic spheres arise in physics in the context of global gravitational anomalies .",
    "+ this brings us to our method of constructing @xmath8 , which does not use pontrjagin numbers at all . for our overall blueprint , we take inspiration from physics : first , specify a system of fields on cobordisms and closed manifolds . then construct an action functional on these fields .",
    "this action should assign a `` quantized '' algebraic / combinatorial structure to a given smooth field . finally define the state sum by summing the actional functional of all fields on the cobordism .",
    "the fundamental idea of positive tfts , as explained in @xcite , is to use eilenberg - completeness to implement this summation , thereby circumventing measure - theoretic problems that frequently plague the rigorous development of path integrals . as the fields",
    ", we use in principle smooth maps from the cobordism into the plane which have only fold singularities . such maps are not dense in the space of all smooth maps and are known to carry a lot of information on the topology of their domain . if the boundary of a connected cobordism @xmath26 is empty , then a smooth map @xmath70 is homotopic to a fold map if and only if the euler characteristic of @xmath26 is even .",
    "thus our tft will have nothing to say about closed cobordisms of odd euler characteristic .",
    "if the boundary of @xmath26 is not empty , then the parity of the euler characteristic is no obstruction to the existence of fold maps : for example if @xmath26 is the cylinder @xmath71\\times m$ ] on a closed manifold @xmath10 of odd euler characteristic , then suspending a morse function on @xmath10 will give a fold map on @xmath26 , despite the euler characteristic of @xmath26 being odd .",
    "we summarize the required basic properties of fold maps in section [ sec.foldmaps ] .",
    "the problem is that using all such fold maps will not yield a tft for two reasons : it is not clear how to define the action functional , and the gluing law can not be established .",
    "therefore , one must find suitable further conditions to place on a fold map .",
    "this is somewhat delicate since one must simultaneously enable the gluing law while not losing too many fold maps in order to still detect exotic spheres .",
    "this problem is solved in definition [ def.foldfield ] , where we introduce the concept of a fold _ field _ , which is central to this work .",
    "we do not prove any new results on fold maps .",
    "the goal was rather to understand whether , and how , they can be used to obtain tfts . now given a fold field on a cobordism , we must define the action functional on it .",
    "this is done in two steps : the first one uses the singular set of the fold map to assign a combinatorial object to the map .",
    "the second step uses representation theory to map the combinatorial object to linear algebra . for step one ,",
    "we define the brauer category @xmath72 , a categorification of the brauer algebras @xmath73 .",
    "the latter arose in the representation theory of the orthogonal group @xmath74 , see @xcite , @xcite , and have since played an important role in knot theory .",
    "the brauer category is a compact ( i.e. every object is dualizable ) , symmetric , strict monoidal category . loosely speaking ,",
    "the morphisms are @xmath0-dimensional unoriented tangles in a high - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "as those can always be disentangled , @xmath72 is very close , but not equal , to the category of @xmath0-dimensional cobordisms .",
    "one difference is that the objects of the latter , being @xmath75-manifolds , are unordered ( finite ) sets , whereas the objects of @xmath72 are _ ordered _ tuples of points .",
    "another difference is that the cobordism category has a huge number of objects ( though few isomorphism types ) , whereas the brauer category has very few objects to begin with and has the property that two objects are isomorphic if and only if they are equal .",
    "the important point is that the morphisms of @xmath72 are determined entirely by the combinatorics of their endpoint connections and the number of loops they contain . in section [ ssec.actionfoldfieldsbrauer ]",
    ", we construct a map @xmath76 , which assigns to every fold field a morphism in the brauer category . for the second step ,",
    "we construct in theorem [ thm.functorytangvect ] linear representations of the brauer category , that is , symmetric strict monoidal functors @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the category of finite dimensional real vector spaces and linear maps .",
    "it is technically important here that one endows @xmath78 ( as such , i.e. without changing its objects or morphisms ) with a tensor product so that it becomes a _ strict _ monoidal category .",
    "that this can in fact be done was shown by schauenburg in @xcite . to construct representations @xmath79 ,",
    "we begin in section [ ssec.linearduality ] by introducing the algebraic concept of a _ duality structure _ ( definition [ def.dualitystructure ] ) . using techniques from knot theory introduced by turaev in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , we find in proposition [ prop.tanggensrels ] a presentation of the brauer category by generating morphisms and relations .",
    "this result then allows us to prove that every duality structure on a finite dimensional vector space gives rise to a symmetric strict monoidal functor @xmath79 . in order to detect exotic smooth structures ,",
    "it is important that some of these representations @xmath79 are faithful on loops .",
    "this is shown in proposition [ prop.expleloopfaithful ] .",
    "given such a @xmath79 , we form the composition @xmath80 .",
    "given a cobordism @xmath26 , we get the state sum @xmath44 in section [ ssec.statesums ] by evaluating @xmath80 on all fold fields ( obeying boundary conditions ) on @xmath26 and summing the resulting values using the eilenberg - completeness of @xmath3 ( see in particular equation ( [ equ.statesumdef ] ) ) .",
    "+ the commutative monoid @xmath3 depends on a choice of duality structure and uses the associated representation @xmath79 as described above .",
    "it is constructed in section [ sec.proidemcompletion ] by applying a general process called profinite idempotent completion .",
    "roughly , this process completes a subset of a vector space which is invariant under rescaling by powers of a given scalar ( in the application the trace of the loop ) to an idempotent complete semimodule .",
    "the rest of that section describes the purely algebraic , as well as the important completeness and continuity properties , of @xmath3 .",
    "it also introduces the semirings @xmath4 and @xmath5 , whose common underlying additive monoid is @xmath3 .",
    "the product on @xmath4 comes from the composition of morphisms , while the product on @xmath5 comes from the monoidal product of morphisms .",
    "+ the informational content of our state sum invariant seems to be a mixture of index constraints such as morse inequalities , i.e. roughly homological content , and certain characteristic classes .",
    "however , our tft packages this mixture in such a way that a gluing theorem holds , which does not involve contributions from the common boundary .",
    "recall that homology itself does not glue in this sense , since the mayer - vietoris sequence _ does _ involve the homology of the boundary . similarly , as discussed above , characteristic classes and numbers do not in general glue like tft - type invariants .",
    "+ atiyah s original tqft axioms imply that state modules are always finite dimensional , but on p. 181 of @xcite , he indicates that allowing state modules to be infinite dimensional may be necessary in interesting examples of tfts .",
    "the state modules of our positive tft are indeed infinitely generated , as mentioned before .",
    "atiyah s classical axioms also demand that the state sum @xmath81 of a cylinder @xmath82 be the identity when viewed as an endomorphism .",
    "the map @xmath81 on @xmath11 should be the `` imaginary time '' evolution operator @xmath83 ( where @xmath38 is the length of the interval @xmath84 ) , so atiyah s axiom means that the hamiltonian @xmath85 and there is no dynamics along a cylinder .",
    "we do not require this for positive tfts and will allow interesting propagation along the cylinder .",
    "in particular , one can not phrase positive tfts as monoidal functors on cobordism categories , as this would imply that the cylinder , which is an identity morphism in the cobordism category , would have to be mapped to an identity morphism .",
    "since @xmath81 need not be the identity , it can also generally not be deduced in a positive tft that @xmath86 , an identity that would not make sense in the first place , as @xmath11 need not have finite dimension .",
    "the present paper does not make substantial use of the cobordism category . nor do we consider @xmath23-categories or manifolds with corners here .",
    "+ we have tried to make the exposition as self - contained as possible . in particular ,",
    "the reader is not assumed to be familiar with @xcite .",
    "likewise , no prior exposure to semirings and semimodules over them is necessary .",
    "section [ sec.monssemirings ] is devoted to a careful review of the required elements of semimodule theory .",
    "particular emphasis is placed on explaining the notion of eilenberg - completeness , as well as additive idempotence and continuity .",
    "proposition [ prop.eilensummaslovint ] relates eilenberg summation to idempotent integration theory as developed in idempotent analysis by the russian school around v. p. maslov , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it follows that the entire paper , in particular our state sum , could be recast in terms of maslov s idempotent integral .",
    "a few words about the completed tensor product @xmath87 which is the topic of section [ sec.funcompltensorprod ] , are in order . in the complete idempotent _ commutative _ setting , litvinov , maslov and shpiz have constructed in @xcite such a tensor product .",
    "this is an idempotent analog of topological tensor products in the sense of grothendieck .",
    "now , the present paper needs such an analog even over noncommutative semirings , since the semirings @xmath88 are generally not commutative .",
    "we construct such a completed tensor product @xmath15 in section [ sec.funcompltensorprod ] .",
    "our main result is theorem [ thm.funiso ] , which provides a tensor decomposition of function semimodules .",
    "this is essential for establishing some of the above properties of @xmath8 . + * general notation .",
    "* the letter @xmath84 will denote both the unit interval @xmath71 $ ] and unit objects in monoidal categories",
    ". the symbol @xmath0 will denote the ( real ) number as well as identity morphisms of various categories .",
    "in addition , we often find it convenient to denote certain identity morphisms by the symbol @xmath89 .",
    "we do this in the interest of readability : we usually reserve @xmath90 for the identity map on some topological space @xmath91 , whereas @xmath92 is used for any identity morphism in categories different from the topological one .",
    "the imaginary part of a complex number @xmath93 will be denoted by @xmath94 .",
    "this is not to be confused with the image of a map .",
    "thus @xmath95 is the imaginary part of a complex valued function @xmath96 , not the image of @xmath96 .",
    "categories will be denoted by boldface letters such as @xmath97 .",
    "we write @xmath98 for the class of objects and @xmath99 for the class of morphisms .",
    "if @xmath40 is a morphism in some category , then @xmath100 and @xmath101 denote its domain and codomain , respectively .",
    "closed smooth @xmath9-dimensional manifolds will be named @xmath102 , while compact smooth @xmath23-manifolds with possibly nonempty boundary ( cobordisms ) will be named @xmath103 etc . for the present paper ,",
    "we wish the natural numbers to be an additive monoid . thus we include zero , @xmath104 + * acknowledgments . * we are grateful to vladimir turaev for helpful comments and to osamu saeki for providing us with some initial orientation concerning fold maps .",
    "we thank dominik wrazidlo for his remarks on an early version of the manuscript , leading to several improvements .",
    "in the course of the construction of our tft , two particular monoidal categories will play an important role : the brauer category and the category of real vector spaces @xmath78 .",
    "the brauer algebras @xmath73 arose in the representation theory of the orthogonal group @xmath74 , see @xcite , @xcite , and have since played an important role in knot theory .",
    "we shall require a categorification , which we denote by @xmath72 , of brauer s algebras .",
    "the present section gives a detailed construction of this categorification , together with derivations of its main properties .",
    "we also construct linear representations of @xmath72 ( theorem [ thm.functorytangvect ] ) and prove that there exist linear representations of @xmath72 which are faithful on loops ( proposition [ prop.expleloopfaithful ] ) .",
    "let @xmath78 denote the category of finite dimensional real vector spaces and linear maps .",
    "we shall endow @xmath78 with the structure of a symmetric strict monoidal category .",
    "the ordinary tensor product of vector spaces is well - known not to be associative , though it is associative up to natural isomorphism .",
    "thus , if we endowed @xmath78 with the ordinary tensor product and took the unit object @xmath84 to be the one - dimensional vector space @xmath105 , then , using obvious associators and unitors , @xmath78 would become a monoidal category , but not a strict one .",
    "there is an abstract process of turning a monoidal category @xmath97 into a monoidally equivalent strict monoidal category @xmath106 .",
    "however , this process changes the category considerably and is thus not always practical .",
    "instead , we base our monoidal structure on the schauenburg tensor product @xmath107 introduced in @xcite , which does not change the category @xmath78 at all .",
    "the product @xmath107 satisfies the strict associativity @xmath108 we shall thus simply write @xmath109 for this vector space . the unit object @xmath84 remains the same as in the usual nonstrict monoidal structure , @xmath110 , and one has @xmath111 the strict monoidal category @xmath112 thus obtained is monoidally equivalent to the usual nonstrict monoidal category of vector spaces .",
    "the underlying functor of this monoidal equivalence is the identity . in particular",
    ", there is a natural isomorphism @xmath113 @xmath114 , where @xmath115 denotes the standard tensor product of vector spaces .",
    "note that via @xmath116 we are able to speak of elements @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 .",
    "the identity @xmath121 holds for elements @xmath122 and @xmath120 . the basic idea behind",
    "the construction of @xmath107 is to set up a specific new equivalence of categories @xmath123 such that @xmath124 is the identity and then setting @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the strictly associative tensor product in @xmath127 . then @xmath128 let @xmath129 be the standard braiding @xmath130 on @xmath131 .",
