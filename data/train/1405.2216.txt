    "the receiver is located at ( 1200 , 1200 ) and is exercising omni - directional reception with minimum sinr of 6 db and the actual experienced sinr at the reciever is 33 db .",
    "we note that as the distance from a receiver increases , a cochannel transmitter can exercise higher transmission power .",

    "thus , when the unit - side is 1 m , the sampling point is very close to the actual receiver location and the spectrum - opportunity is accurately quantified .",
    "this difference in the quantification of the available spectrum illustrates that sampling rate should be chosen based on the _ access - density _ or the _ propagation environment characteristics_.",

    "we can see that :    * in case of underlay spectrum access , all the su networks are exercising spectrum , thus the number of scheduled requests is same as the number of su networks .",
    "however , since the transmit power is heavily constrained , the signal power at the secondary receivers is very low .",
    "also , these receivers experience interference from the pu transmitter and the transmitters of the cochannel su networks . * in case of overlay spectrum access , when pu transmitter is not within the sensing range of the su network transceivers , a spectrum access is exercised .",
    "the su sensitivity is considered to be -80 dbm and the ple of 3.5 which implies 1390 m of sensing range .",
    "thus , very often , with overlay spectrum - access policy , a spectrum - access is not performed and the spectrum consumption performance is poor when pu is present . when su transmitter can exercise access to the spectrum , the signal power at the su receivers may not be high due to constraints on the su transmit - power and those receivers need to tolerate interference from the cochannel pu and su transmissions .",
    "* the dynamic overlay ( stov ) with unconstrained su transmit power faces similar issues and shows low spectrum consumption performance when pu is present .",
