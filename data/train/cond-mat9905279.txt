    "it is a dailylife experience that the top surface of a mass of granular matter need not be horizontal unlike that of a stagnant liquid",
    ". however , there exists an upper limit to the slope of the top surface , and the angle between this maximum slope and the horizontal is known , for non - cohesive material , as the coulomb critical angle @xmath0 . above this angle , the material becomes unstable , and an avalanche at the surface might occur .",
    "the coulomb angle is related to the friction properties through @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an internal friction coefficient  .    as of today",
    ", the physical picture associated with the onset of the avalanche is still obscure .",
    "one could imagine a local scenario in which the dislodgement of some unstable grains leads by amplification to a global avalanche ( see for instance  ) .",
    "alternately , one can think of a delocalized mechanism  , in which a thin slice of material is destabilized and starts to slide as a whole . in the present paper",
    ", we will focus on the latter point of view .",
    "it has been recently suggested   that the thickness of the initial gliding layer should be of the order of @xmath3 , the mesh size of the contact force network  . for simple grain shapes ( spheroidal ) ,",
    "one expects @xmath4 510 grain diameter @xmath5 .",
    "the angle at which the avalanche process actually starts is of the order of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the size of the free surface . at the moment of onset ,",
    "our picture is that this initial layer starts to slip , and is rapidly fluidized by the collisions with the underlying heap , therefore generating a layer of rolling grains on the whole surface .    now that we have proposed a description of the initial situation",
    ", we may turn to the model scheme accounting for the further evolution of the avalanche .",
    "some years ago , bouchaud , cates , ravi prakash and edwards introduced a model to describe surface flows of granular materials  .",
    "the model assumes a rather sharp distinction between _ immobile _ particles and _ rolling _ particles and , accordingly , introduces the following two important physical quantities ( see fig .",
    "[ bcrepicture ] ) : the local height of immobile particles @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 denotes the horizontal coordinate   and @xmath10 the time ) , and the local amount of rolling particles @xmath11 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath8 is written in the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the local slope , @xmath14 a characteristic frequency and @xmath15 the neutral angle of grains at which erosion of the immobile grains balances accretion of the rolling grains .",
    "for the rolling particles , bouchaud and co - workers wrote a convection - diffusion equation   that was later simplified by de gennes as   @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the downhill typical velocity of the flow , and is assumed to be constant .",
    "according to the bouchaud - cates - ravi prakash - edwards ( bcre ) model , @xmath18 is linear in @xmath19 [ see eq .  ] .",
    "this is natural at small @xmath19 , when all the rolling grains interact with the immobile particles .",
    "but as explained in refs .  , this can not hold when @xmath19 becomes larger than a given _ saturation length _ @xmath20 , since the grains in the upper part of the rolling phase are no longer in contact with the immobile grains .",
    "the length @xmath20 is expected to be of the order of a few grain diameters @xmath5  .",
    "this led boutreux , raphal , and de gennes to propose   a modified _ saturated _ version of the bcre eq .  , valid for thick surface flows and of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 .",
    "the constant @xmath22 has the dimensions of a velocity .    the description of thick avalanches modelized by eq .",
    "was discussed in ref .  .",
    "however , one might encounter situations where the local amount @xmath19 of rolling particles is rather large except in some regions of space where it takes values smaller than @xmath20 . for such cases ,",
    "various ` generalized ' forms of the bcre equations valid both in the large and small @xmath19 limit , and able to handle intermediate values have been proposed  . as we will be concerned only with thick flows",
    ", we will henceforth use the saturated form  .",
    "we now consider the hypothesis made in eq .",
    "that the downhill typical convection velocity of the rolling grains @xmath17 is constant . as a matter of fact , @xmath17 might vary for two reasons .",
    "first , @xmath17 depends on the local slope @xmath24 of the static bed , reflecting that the mean convection velocity should increase as the sandpile is further tilted .",
    "however , in the situation we are going to consider , the slope should never depart from @xmath25 by more than a few degrees , so that the variations of @xmath17 originating in this may reasonably be taken to be negligible .",
    "second , @xmath17 might as well depend on the local amount of rolling particles @xmath19 .",
    "this dependence is quite natural , since as soon as the thickness of the flow exceeds a few grain diameters , one would expect a velocity gradient perpendicular to the flow to establish . such a possibility was already considered by bouchaud _",
    "_  , but , to our best knowledge , not further studied .",
    "we think that taking this velocity gradient into account does lead to an improvement of the model description of avalanches . in the forthcoming sections we will analyse the physical consequences of this modification .",
    "if analyticity is assumed , we can expand @xmath26 in powers of @xmath19 , and considering only the first two contributions to be significant , we write :    @xmath27    with @xmath28 a constant , homogeneous to a shear rate , and @xmath29 a constant velocity .    when @xmath19 becomes small , eq .",
    "tells us that @xmath26 becomes constant [ @xmath30 .",
    "physically this velocity should correspond to the typical convection velocity of a single grain on a bed of immobile grains .",
    "for simple grain shapes ( spheroidal ) and average levels of inelastic collisions , one expects this velocity @xmath29 to scale as @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the gravity )  .",
    "similarly , the shear rate @xmath28 is expected to scale as @xmath33  .",
    "we can therefore rewrite eq .",
    ":    @xmath34    we note that @xmath29 becomes negligible compared to @xmath35 as soon as @xmath19 exceeds a few grain diameters .    in our approach ,",
    "the typical velocity @xmath26 depends on the local rolling height @xmath19 [ eq .  ] .",
    "such a form is in part motivated by the recent work of douady _ et al . _",
    "( see also section  [ conclusion ] ) .",
    "it is also supported by the experimental results of rajchenbach _ et al . _ who carried measurements in a rotating drum  .",
    "these authors have found linear velocity profiles in the surface flow , with a shear rate @xmath28 independent of the thickness of the flow .",
    "however , in other experiments of chute flows carried on rough inclined planes , anzaza _ et al . _   and pouliquen   observe that the mean velocity ( averaged on cross - sections ) scales as a power - law of the thickness with an exponent about 3/2 . in the following",
    "we will mainly focus on the linear form  , since it allows us to give explicit analytical solutions , and shall discuss the changes that are to be brought in the case of a power - law velocity in section  [ sectionrmax ] .    in the next section",
    ", we will derive the governing equations from the saturated bcre equations and the above considerations on the velocity profile inside the flow .",
    "we may define a reduced profile @xmath36 , deduced from @xmath37 by substracting the ` neutral ' profile @xmath38 :    @xmath39    using eqs  ,  ,   and  , we easily obtain the following system :    @xmath40    in our approach , eqs .   and   are the governing equations for surface avalanches displaying linear velocity profiles .",
    "an important point is that we must have @xmath41 for eqs .   and   to be valid .",
    "if we reach @xmath42 in a certain spatial domain , then eq .   must be replaced in that domain by @xmath43 .",
    "we will now solve eqs .   and   in the following simple situation :",
    "we consider a cell , of dimension @xmath7 , partially filled with monodisperse grains of diameter @xmath5 , as shown on fig .",
    "[ figopencell ] .",
    "the heap has an initial uniform slope @xmath0 , the coulomb angle of the material .",
    "the origin of the @xmath9 axis is taken at the bottom of the cell , and the orientation of the axis is such that the slope of the heap is positive .",
    "we now consider that an avalanche has just started in the cell ( see section  [ onset ] ) , so that we have at time @xmath44 a layer of rolling grains in the whole cell , of thickness @xmath45 greater than the saturation length @xmath20 .",
    "we may thus use the saturated equations   and   from the beginning of the avalanche .    as the rolling population will rapidly grow and become independent of the initial thickness @xmath3 ( for @xmath3 small ) , we can as well consider the initial condition on @xmath19 to be :    @xmath46    we also know the initial value of @xmath36 :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is defined as the ( positive ) difference between the coulomb angle and the neutral angle .",
    "we have additional conditions in our system , due to the boundaries . at the top of the cell",
    ", there is no feeding in rolling species , so that we impose :    @xmath49    another condition arises from the fact that grains fall off the cell at the bottom and can not accumulate there :    @xmath50      equation   can be readily solved along with conditions   and   to give :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 denotes the heavyside unit step function [ @xmath53 if @xmath54 , @xmath55 otherwise ] .",
    "this result corresponds to the uphill propagation ( at constant speed @xmath56 ) of a surface wave on the static phase .",
    "let us call @xmath57 the time - dependent position of the wavefront , given by :    @xmath58    ( where the subscript @xmath59 stands for ` uphill ' ) .",
    "the wave starts from the bottom of the cell at time @xmath44 and reaches the upper end at time @xmath60 defined by :    @xmath61    at a given time @xmath10 ( smaller than @xmath60 ) , the profile of the static phase can be described as follows : ahead of the wavefront , the profile is linear and the slope is the initial angle @xmath0 ( since @xmath62 ) . behind the wavefront [ @xmath63 ,",
    "the slope has decreased and reached the neutral angle @xmath25 ( @xmath64 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ figh ] ) . for times",
    "@xmath65 the slope of the static phase inside the cell is uniformly equal to the final value @xmath25 , which is thus the angle of repose of our specific open cell system  .      substituting eq .   into the evolution equation   for @xmath19",
    "gives :    @xmath66    eq .",
    "is a non - linear convection equation .",
    "the rolling species are thus convected downhill , with a convection velocity dependent on the local rolling thickness @xmath19 . in the spatial region",
    "@xmath67 , the right - hand side ( which couples the evolution of @xmath19 to that of @xmath36 ) plays the role of a source term , leading to an amplification of the avalanche . on the contrary , for @xmath68",
    ", the right - hand side goes to zero , so that the material flowing through the surface @xmath69 from uphill is simply convected , without amplification nor damping .",
    "equation   can be solved analytically by using the _ method of characteristics _  , which utilizes the property that certain types of partial differential equations reduce to a set of ordinary differential equations along particular lines , known as the characteristic curves . for more details on this method and on its application in the case of eq .",
    ", see appendix .",
    "before we go to the precise solutions , we can try to get some physical insight of the way the avalanche is going to develop .",
    "the global shape of the rolling phase at different moments during the avalanche is of course very dependent on the boundary condition   for @xmath19 in the cell , but also on the condition   for @xmath36 , since the evolution of @xmath36 and @xmath19 are coupled .",
    "however , the effects of these boundary conditions can not spread over the entire cell instantly after the beginning of the avalanche , and shall propagate with finite velocities .",
    "we then expect the progression of these boundary effects ( one could say , the propagation of the ` information ' on the boundaries ) to control the evolution of both the rolling and the static phase . for instance , in the case of the static profile @xmath36 , eq .   tells us that the bottom boundary condition   [ @xmath70 at any time @xmath10 ] brings progressively @xmath36 to zero everywhere in the cell , and also , that the propagation proceeds with a velocity @xmath56 .",
    "hence , we expect that the description of the avalanche should naturally split up in different temporal ` stages ' , according to the degree of extension of the different boundary effects , and that the cell should divide in several ` regions ' , according to whether it is under the influence of the top boundary condition or the bottom , or both , etc .",
    "this shall become clear as we will now go into the precise description of the avalanche .",
    "this stage starts at @xmath44 with the beginning of the avalanche . from the above considerations , we know that the boundary effects start to propagate with finite velocities from both ends of the cell .",
    "we can therefore define ` propagation fronts ' for these effects : we call @xmath72 the position of the front originating in the boundary condition at the _ top _ of the cell [ the subscript @xmath73 means that the motion of this front is downhill ] , and @xmath57 the corresponding ` uphill ' front , originating in the _ bottom _ boundary condition , and that we already defined earlier as @xmath74 [ eq .  ] .",
    "figure  [ figstagei]-a presents a typical picture of the situation during stage i , where the fronts , after leaving their respective cell ends , move in opposite directions and one toward the other . as a consequence , they shall finally meet at a certain time , that we hereafter denote @xmath75 .",
    "this time @xmath75 defines the end of what we call ` stage i ' ( which is thus characterized as the time interval @xmath76 ) , and the beginning of ` stage ii ' ( described in next section ) .",
    "the relative positions of the fronts naturally define three spatial regions in the cell ( fig .",
    "[ figstagei]-a ) . to the left of @xmath77 , the effects of the bottom boundary condition [ eq .  ]",
    "are predominant .",
    "we call this region the _ bottom _ region .",
    "we remark that it is constantly extending uphill during stage i [ following the motion of @xmath57 ] . to the right of @xmath72",
    ", we define the _ top _ region , which extends downhill , and where the evolution of the avalanche is controlled by the upper end condition [ eq .  ] .",
    "finally , between those two regions remains a _",
    "central _ region , where none of the boundary effects can yet be felt .",
    "this last region shrinks during stage i , and ultimately disappears at time @xmath79 when the bottom and top region connect .",
    "we now describe the precise evolution of the avalanche , region by region [ we will only give the form of the rolling amount @xmath11 , since @xmath8 is already known from eq .  ] .      from the above definition",
    ", the top region corresponds to the spatial domain @xmath80 . within this domain , eq .   reads :    @xmath81",
    "[ since @xmath82 .",
    "solving this equation with the boundary condition ( see appendix for details ) gives the expression of @xmath19 valid in this region :    @xmath83    we also obtain the precise position of the ` downhill front ' @xmath72 :    @xmath84    thus , according to eq .",
    ", @xmath19 has a stationary shape ( independent of time ) , but on a domain that extends downhill with time .",
    "interestingly , we note that the motion of @xmath72 is uniformly accelerated throughout the stage .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the non - linearity in eq .  .      in the central region ,",
    "the boundary conditions have no influence on the evolution of @xmath19 and @xmath36 .",
    "the central region is hence spatially defined by @xmath85 , and shrinks at both ends to disappear at the end of the stage .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath19 is the same as in the top region [ eq .  ] , but now we must impose the initial condition   ( no boundary condition ) .",
    "the solution ( see appendix ) writes :    @xmath86    in the central region the rolling phase grows linearly with time and uniformly in space , thus forming a plateau ( see fig .",
    "[ figstagei]-b ) .",
    "this constant growth rate is a consequence of the saturated form of the bcre equations we have used [ eq .  ] .",
    "the uniformity of the solution , on the other hand , stems from the fact that since none of the boundaries is at work , and since the initial static profile was uniform , the central region behaves like an infinite medium for which translational invariance is to be obeyed .",
    "we finally remark that solutions   and   connect continuously at @xmath87 .",
    "the bottom region is controlled by the bottom boundary condition , and spreads over the spatial interval . in this region the evolution equation for @xmath19 displays no more amplification (",
    "because @xmath88 ) : .",
    "since there is no constraint on @xmath19 at the bottom of the cell , the condition on @xmath19 is given by the physical assumption that it should be continuous across the border of the central and bottom regions , i.e. @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "this leads to the following expression for @xmath19 :    @xmath91    in this region also the height of rolling grains increases with time , due to an increasing input of material at the frontier with the central region .",
    "i ends when the top and bottom regions meet , at @xmath79 defined by @xmath92 . using eqs .   and",
    ", we easily obtain    @xmath93    as will be shown later , the maximum thickness of the avalanche , @xmath94 , is actually reached for @xmath79 and @xmath95 .",
    "we can clearly see on fig .",
    "[ figstagei ] that the @xmath19-profile at time @xmath79 displays a cusp . as the prediction of the maximum amplitude",
    "@xmath94 is an important result of our analysis , we shall devote section  [ sectionrmax ] to it , and defer the analytical derivation of @xmath94 and its application to physical examples until there .    fig .",
    "[ figstagei]-b presents successive ` snapshots ' of the rolling phase profile during stage i.      stage ii starts at @xmath79 . at time @xmath75 , the two ` propagation fronts ' of the boundary effects @xmath57 and @xmath72 pass each other , and then pursue their respective motions towards the opposite cell edge .",
    "figure  [ figstageii]-a illustrates this situation . as in stage",
    "i , it appears that the cell is naturally divided in three spatial regions : a top region [ defined spatially as @xmath96 , under the sole influence of the upper edge of the cell ; a bottom region , under the influence of the bottom edge ; and finally , a central region [ @xmath97 , where in contrast with stage i , the effects of _ both _ boundaries now combine . as another difference with the situation described in stage i ,",
    "the top and bottom regions progressively shrink , whereas the central one grows in extension ( fig .",
    "[ figstageii]-a ) .    due to their motion , the fronts @xmath98 and @xmath77 are bound to reach , sooner or later , the bottom and top end of the cell ( respectively ) . at time @xmath60 [ eq .",
    "] , the uphill front reaches the upper limit of the cell ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the static profile is then in its relaxed final state , with a uniform slope @xmath25 .",
    "this is the end of stage ii , which is thus defined as the time interval @xmath100 . in most cases , as is discussed below , we expect the downhill front to reach the bottom edge _ before _ @xmath101 .      in this region , we have @xmath102 , so that the evolution equation   still holds , and we still have to solve with respect to the upper boundary condition of eq .  .",
    "therefore , as in stage i , @xmath19 is given by eq .",
    "[ but now , the lower limit of the domain on which this solution is valid is @xmath57 , not @xmath72 ] .",

    "it is easy to prove that the crest remains located on the downhill front @xmath98 .",
    "besides , @xmath98 now moves at constant speed ( in contrast with stage i where it accelerated ) : .",
    "we can also prove that the height of the crest remains constant ( equal to @xmath94 ) as it travels downhill , until it finally comes out of the cell .",
    "the exit time @xmath109 of this crest @xmath94 is obtained by solving @xmath110 :    @xmath111      the bottom region is defined as the region where .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath19 is the same as in the central region , and we impose continuity at the border with the central region .",
    "we find that @xmath11 is given by eq .   as in stage i. physically , in this region",
    ", we simply observe the convection of what was left in the bottom region at the end of stage i.    the bottom region disappears when the downhill front reaches the bottom end : @xmath110 , that is by definition at time @xmath112 [ eq .  ] .",
    "to determine precisely the subsequent evolution of the avalanche , we must discuss whether the disappearance of the bottom region occurs before the end of stage ii or not ( that is , whether @xmath113 or @xmath114 ) . using eq .",
    ", we form the ratio : @xmath115    provided that the cell dimension @xmath116 and that @xmath117 ( these requirements being usually satisfied for common experiments ) , we have @xmath118 , and @xmath119 . hence we generally expect @xmath120 , and , consequently , as claimed earlier , in most cases the bottom region disappears before the end of stage ii .",
    "to resume , during stage ii , the central region extends both downhill and uphill with constant ( though different ) velocities at each end , progressively invading the whole cell .",
    "it reaches the bottom edge at time @xmath109 ( in situations where @xmath120 ) , then the upper edge at time @xmath60 . at the end of stage",
    "ii , the central region occupies the entire cell , and @xmath121 is everywhere given by eq .  .",

    "[ figstageii]-b .",
    "this stage lasts from @xmath101 until the end of the avalanche , at @xmath122 .",
    "both fronts have reached the edges of the cell at the end of stage ii ( @xmath123 ) , and there is only one region ( see fig .  [ figstageiii]-a ) . moreover , as @xmath124 , the slope of the static part is everywhere @xmath25 and no amplification of the rolling grains can take place ; the rolling phase is simply convected downwards .",
    "we now have to solve the evolution equation , with respect to the initial condition that stage iii evolves from what has been left by stage ii [ i.e. @xmath121 as given by eq .  ] .",
    "solving with the method of characteristics gives the following implicit solution    @xmath125    where @xmath126 ( t - t_{2})\\ ] ] ( and @xmath127 ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of these equations is actually very simple : eq .",

    "equation   gives a determination of this initial position @xmath3 , by stating that from @xmath60 until the considered instant @xmath10 , the quantity of grains moved with a constant speed @xmath129 $ ] , dependent on the local height .",
    "in other words , during stage iii , the @xmath19-profile left by stage ii is convected downhill , but each vertical slice rolls with its own velocity , which is a function of its height .",
    "the grains that were near the top edge of the cell at the end of stage ii are convected the most slowly , since there @xmath19 was close to zero .",
    "the profile inherited from stage ii thus dilates upon rolling , under the effect of velocity inhomogeneities ( fig .",
    "[ figstageiii]-b )  .    the last grains to fall off the cell are those that leave the top end of the cell at the beginning of stage iii , at time @xmath60 .",
    "since at the top edge we have @xmath42 , these grains move with a constant speed @xmath130 . at time @xmath10 ,",
    "they are located at @xmath131 , and the avalanche is extinct uphill : @xmath42 for @xmath132 .    finally , the avalanche ends when the last grains reach the bottom limit of the cell ( @xmath133 ) , that is at time @xmath134 .",
    "up to now , we have focused on flows displaying linear velocity profiles . for such flows ,",
    "as we saw in section  [ stagei ] , the avalanche reaches its maximum amplitude @xmath94 at the end of stage i , at time @xmath79 [ eq .  ] .",
    "the exact analytical expression of @xmath94 is easily found by using eq .   at time",

    "however , as pointed out by pouliquen  , the influence of the rough underlying bed plane on the rheology of chute flows is complex and not clearly understood , and might not be comparable to situations where the flow occurs on a _ free _ granular bed as has been considered in this paper . since the question is still open , we will here present an intuitive derivation of @xmath94 valid for any power - law . to check the validity of this simple derivation ,",
    "we first present it in the linear case @xmath150 , the generalization being then straightforward .",
    "let us consider a point initially at the top edge of the cell . at @xmath44",
    ", it starts being swept along by the granular flow and we assume that this point travels with the local surface velocity of the flow @xmath151 .",
    "we are now interested in the temporal evolution of the rolling height @xmath19 _ at this travelling point _ , which shall be computed from the lagrangian derivative @xmath152 .",

    "we compute @xmath157 in the following way : the distance that the travelling point goes over during the amplification is of order @xmath158 , so that @xmath157 must verify :          this is exactly eq",
    ".   found analytically , which was itself the limit of the complete expression of @xmath94 [ eq .",
    "] for large values of l ( greater than a hundred @xmath5 ) , and @xmath56 of order @xmath162 .",
    "the strongest assumption in the above simple derivation is that the amplification takes place over a .",
    "rigorously , this distance is ; but what makes our simple derivation successful is that the position of the downhill front at time @xmath75 , @xmath163 , is generally quite close to zero ( for @xmath7 greater than a hundred @xmath5 and @xmath56 of order @xmath162 ) .",
    "the loss of material at the bottom edge of the cell might be measured experimentally , and could be compared to the following theoretical prediction .",
    "this loss corresponds to the flow rate at the bottom of the cell @xmath168 , and is given by @xmath169 where @xmath170 is given by eq .   during stages",
    "i and ii , and by eq .   during stage iii .",
    "figure  [ figroutput ] shows the predicted shape of @xmath171 as a function of time ( solid curve ) . the curve displays a maximum at time @xmath112 ,",
    "corresponding to the moment when the maximum amplitude @xmath94 rolls out of the cell .",
    "the maximum flow rate is obtained by replacing @xmath170 by @xmath94 in eq .  .",
    "it is of interest to compare our prediction for the loss of material with that of boutreux _ et al .",
    "_  , who assumed a constant downhill velocity @xmath17 in the rolling phase .",
    "this comparison , however , requires some caution : in our approach , the granular flow is characterized by a constant velocity gradient @xmath28 , whereas , in boutreux _",
    "_ , the description is based on a typical downhill convection velocity of the grains @xmath17 ( see section  [ profile ] ) .",
    "figure  [ figroutput ] compares the results of both approaches for the loss of material , assuming @xmath172 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "we notice that , during the avalanche , we had several spatial zones in the cell where r was close to 0 ( @xmath173 ) , e.g. at the upper edge of the cell , or at the end of the avalanche .",
    "thus in these zones , the use of the saturated eqs .   and   is not fully justified . in order to obtain a continuous description between the saturated case and the thin one",
    ", we could use the interpolated equations that have been proposed by de gennes   and studied in a model case by boutreux and raphal in ref .  :",
    "the results of   show however that the physical behaviour is not dramatically changed , and that the description in the zones of small r with saturated equations might be slightly wrong but qualitatively verified .",
    "it is of common knowledge that real granular materials are generally intrinsically polydisperse .",
    "this may have drastic effects on the behavior of the flow , and capturing more precisely the physics of real avalanches would certainly suppose to take polydispersity into account .",
    "however , the treatment of full polydispersity is a difficult task . yet , the bcre equations have been extended to the case of binary mixtures  , and it could be interesting to study the changes brought up in this case by a velocity gradient in the flow .",
    "the general approach introduced by bouchaud _",
    "_ to describe surface flows is rather phenomenological , and as pointed out by bouchaud and cates  , we still lack criteria to determine the range of physical situations to which it can be successfully applied . in a recent work , douady _",
    "et al . _",
    "proposed a justification of the bcre modelization on the basis of hydrodynamic conservation laws .",
    "according to these authors , the form of the bcre equations should not remain invariant when different laws are chosen for the velocity profile in the flow .",
    "_ argue that only for a velocity linear in @xmath19 ( or constant ) shall the equations take the simple form of our equations [ eqs .   and  ] ; in other cases , they find that a supplementary term coupling @xmath19 and @xmath37 should add in eq .  .",
    "certainly , more work needs to be done in this direction in order to exactly assert the domain of validity of the bcre analysis .",
    ".   is a first - order partial differential equation , of the quasi - linear class , that is , linear in the first derivatives .",
    "such equations can be solved by the well - known method of characteristics .",
    "see , for example , ref .  .",
    "more specifically , we will solve eq .",
    "along characteristic curves given in the parametric form @xmath175 , with @xmath176 the parameter .",
    "the functions @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 are derived from the set of coupled ordinary differential equations :        we here give the detailed calculations only for the first stage of the avalanche .",
    "the derivations are separated into the different spatial regions that were defined earlier , and we will show how they naturally emerge from the derivations .",
    "we also use the boundary condition @xmath182 for @xmath183 , which we parametrize with the parameter @xmath3 . for simplicity s sake , on each characteristic crossing the boundary curve we arbitrarily choose the value of the parameter @xmath176 to be zero at the crossing point .",
    "this determines the integration constants to be :            we now want to write the solution @xmath19 explicitly in terms of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , so that we have to eliminate @xmath3 and @xmath176 .",
    "eq .   can be solved to give @xmath176 as a function of @xmath9 , and replacing into eq",
    ".   brings the analytical solution :        we now have to verify the condition that @xmath185 . by combining eq",
    ".   with   this condition",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath188 .",
    "replacing @xmath19 into this inequality [ by  ] gives us a spatial condition for solution   to be valid : we must have @xmath189 , where          the evolution equation for @xmath19 is the same as in the top zone , so that the differential equations giving the characteristics also are the same [ eqs .  ] .",
    "but now we must impose the initial condition @xmath191 , which gives the following set of initial conditions for the characteristics : @xmath192 ( and @xmath127 ) .",
    "we obtain :        this solution is valid in a certain spatial domain .",
    "it is limited upwards by the top region [ i.e. @xmath195 .",
    "it is also limited downwards by @xmath57 , because at this point the form of the evolution equation of @xmath19 changes ( the amplification term vanishes ) , and consequently does the form of the differential equations that give the characteristics .        here",
    ", the boundary condition is given by the continuity of @xmath19 at the border of the central and the bottom zones : @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "this gives the initial conditions : @xmath197 .",
    "solving and rewriting @xmath19 explicitly in terms of @xmath9 and @xmath10 leads to the solution :        for a detailed description of the coulomb approach and its extensions , see r.m .",
