    "in this paper , we calculated the three - loop @xmath31 corrections to the @xmath2 decay widths of the sm higgs boson with mass @xmath1 , including the case @xmath3 . to this end , we constructed a @xmath68 effective yukawa lagrangian by integrating out the top quark .",
    "this lagrangian is a linear combination of dimension - four operators acting in qcd with @xmath68 quark flavours , while all @xmath9 dependence is contained in the coefficient functions .",
    "we renormalized this lagrangian and , by exploiting the rg invariance of the energy - momentum tensor , rearranged it in such a way that the renormalized operators and coefficient functions are separately independent of the renormalization scale , @xmath52 , to the order considered .",

    "in contrast to the two - loop @xmath26 case @xcite , where it was sufficient to consider just one term in the lagrangian , we needed to take into account three types of operators and to allow for them to mix under renormalization .",

    "<S> we calculate the top - quark - induced three - loop corrections of @xmath0 to the yukawa couplings of the first five quark flavours in the framework of the minimal standard model with an intermediate - mass higgs boson , with mass @xmath1 . the calculation is performed using an effective - lagrangian approach implemented with the hard - mass procedure . as an application , we derive the @xmath0 corrections to the @xmath2 partial decay widths , including the case @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the couplings of the higgs boson to pairs of leptons and intermediate bosons being known to @xmath0 , this completes the knowledge of such corrections in the higgs sector . </S>",
    "<S> we express the results both in the @xmath4 and on - shell schemes of mass renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> we recover the notion that the qcd perturbation expansions exhibit a worse convergence behaviour in the on - shell scheme than they do in the @xmath4 scheme .    </S>",
