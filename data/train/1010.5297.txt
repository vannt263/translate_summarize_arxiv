    "experimental studies on the specific heat and other quantities for this compound will be carried out in near future .     and the magnetization @xmath0 as functions of temperature in different magnetic fields .",
    "( a ) , ( b ) and ( e ) illustrate the ferrimagnetic case @xmath143 , ( c ) and ( f ) are for the paramagnetic case @xmath144 , and ( d ) depicts the ferromagnetic case @xmath145 . ]",
    "next , we will study the effect of an external magnetic field on the specific heat .",
    "three typical cases will be studied : ferrimagnetic ( @xmath143 ) , paramagnetic ( @xmath146 ) , and ferromagnetic ( @xmath145 ) cases .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - spec field ] , the specific heat in the presence of an external field for the ferrimagnetic case ( @xmath40 , @xmath42 ) is shown .",
    "[ fig - spec field](a ) shows at small fields with @xmath147 , the peak of specific heat moves towards high temperatures , and its height firstly decreases , and then increases with enhancing the field until it approaches the spin flop critical field @xmath100 , which polarizes all spins . in fig .",
    "[ fig - spec field](b ) , when the field keeps increasing , the peak of specific heat becomes dulled , and then splits into double peaks ( except for the point @xmath148 ) , which can be viewed as a field - induced splitting .",
    "similar phenomena have also been observed in other ising and heisenberg spin systems.@xcite the double peak scenario will eventually be spoiled by further increasing @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath149 , the specific heat will again be single - peaked .",
    "it is notable that the divergent peaks at zero field disappear immediately when the field is switched on , which means that the phase transitions are absent and the system remains in the ferrimagnetic phase at all temperatures .",
    "when @xmath19 , the ferrimagnetic ordered phase spontaneously breaks the @xmath107 symmetry contained in the hamiltonian ( see eq .",
    "[ formular - hamiltonian ] ) , and possesses a nonzero order parameter .",
    "when @xmath115 , the thermal fluctuations will destroy the magnetic order , while @xmath107 symmetry will be recovered , and @xmath0 vanishes immediately [ the solid line in fig . [ fig - spec field ] ( e ) ] .",
    "however , the external field explicitly breaks the @xmath107 symmetry in the hamiltonian , and @xmath0 is nonzero even at high temperature @xmath115 [ the symbol lines in fig .",
    "[ fig - spec field ] ( e ) ] .",
    "therefore , no phase transition occurs in the presence of a magnetic field . in fig .",
    "[ fig - spec field](e ) , according to the magnetization @xmath0 at zero temperature , the curves can be classified into three classes . when @xmath150 , the curves start from @xmath1",
    "; while @xmath151 , the spins are polarized and @xmath83 at @xmath22 ; when @xmath148 , the case is of a little subtlety , where @xmath0 equals to the statistical mean value @xmath152 at zero temperature .    in figs .",
    "[ fig - spec field ] ( c ) and",
    "( f ) , the paramagnetic case @xmath144 is studied .",
    "the field will firstly promote the peak height of the specific heat , and moves the peak to the high temperature side .",
    "when @xmath21 is close to the critical field , the specific heat will again be dulled , where the height is decreasing , and the peak splits into two sub peaks except at the point @xmath148 . when the field @xmath153 a single peak of the specific heat recurs .",
    "the @xmath154 curves in fig .",
    "[ fig - spec field ] ( f ) are quite similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig - spec field ] ( e ) and can be classified analogously .",
    "at last , the ferromagnetic case @xmath155 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - spec field ] ( d ) .",
    "the divergent peak for the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic phase transition disappears owing to the same reason in the ferrimagnetic case as mentioned above .",
    "the specific heat reveals a round peak , which moves towards the high temperature side .",
    "by continuously enhancing the field , the height of the peak decreases down firstly and then goes slowly up .    besides",
    ", we have also studied other situations with different couplings , and found that they can be ascribed into the above three classes .",
    "for instance , other ferrimagnetic cases with @xmath156 and ferromagnetic cases with all ferromagnetic couplings ( @xmath157 ) behave similarly with those presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - spec field ] .",
    "in this article , we have systematically studied the thermodynamics and magnetic properties of ising model on a dk lattice by exact solutions and the trg numerical method .",
    "it is shown that the phase diagrams are composed of three phases including ferromagnetic , ferrimagnetic , and paramagnetic phases .",
    "phase transitions between them are identified by studying the specific heat and magnetization .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath158 of @xmath0 near @xmath38 is determined as @xmath159 , which appears to fall into the universality of the 2d ising models .",
    "the trg results of zero - field specific heat agree very well with the exact solutions , showing that trg is an efficient and accurate tool in dealing with 2d ising models .",
    "the trg method is also utilized to study the properties in the presence of a magnetic field . in the magnetization curves",
    ", @xmath17 plateaux at low @xmath65 are identified and , the relations of the plateau width with coupling constants @xmath160 are obtained .",
    "in addition , the zero temperature @xmath97 phase diagrams are presented to clarify the various ground state phases in external magnetic field .",
    "the zero - field susceptibility @xmath108 of the paramagnetic case ( @xmath161 ) is found to obey curie law at low @xmath65 and curie - weiss law at high @xmath65 . while in the ferrimagnetic or ferromagnetic case , the divergent peak of @xmath108 is found at the critical temperature .",
    "moreover , the specific heat under different magnetic fields is also investigated .",
    "it is uncovered that the phase transitions are absent immediately when a magnetic field is switched on , and the field - induced peak splitting of the specific heat is recognized when @xmath21 is close to the critical field .",
    "we have also fitted the experimental data of susceptibility of the complex co(n@xmath2)@xmath3(bpg)@xmath4 dmf@xmath5 with the trg results , and obtained the couplings @xmath162k and @xmath163k . based on trg calculations ,",
    "a ferrimagnetic - paramagnetic phase transition is expected to occur at about @xmath131k in this complex , which will be studied in future .",
    "the present study offers a systematic understanding for physical properties of the 2d ising model on the dk lattice , and will be useful for analyzing future experimental observations in related magnetic materials with dk lattices .",
