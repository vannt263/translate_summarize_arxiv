    "full counting statistics@xcite concerns the distribution of the number of transferred charge , or equivalently , all corresponding cumulants ( irreducible moments ) of the distribution . conventional transport measurements have focused on the first cumulant , the mean current , and in some cases also the second cumulant , the noise.@xcite higher order cumulants , however , reveal additional information concerning a variety of physical phenomena , including quantum coherence , entanglement , disorder , and dissipation.@xcite for example , non - zero higher - order cumulants reflect non - gaussian behavior .",
    "counting statistics in mesoscopic physics has been a subject of intensive theoretical interest for almost two decades , but recently it has also gained considerable experimental interest : in a series of experiments,@xcite high order cumulants and even the entire distribution function of transferred charge have been measured , clearly demonstrating that counting statistics now has become an important concept also in experimental physics .",
    "the theory of counting statistics was first formulated by levitov and lesovik for non - interacting electrons using a scattering formalism.@xcite subsequent works have focused on the inclusion of interaction effects in the theory.@xcite in one approach , coulomb interactions are incorporated via markovian ( generalized ) master equations as originally developed by bagrets and nazarov.@xcite this approach is often convenient when considering systems with strong interactions , e.g. , coulomb - blockade structures .",
    "more recent developments include theories for finite - frequency counting statistics,@xcite conditional counting statistics,@xcite connections to entanglement entropy@xcite and to fluctuation theorems,@xcite and extensions to systems with non - markovian dynamics.@xcite the last topic forms the central theme of this paper .",
    "we have recently published a series of papers on counting statistics.@xcite previous methods for evaluating the counting statistics of systems described by master equations had in practice been limited to systems with only a few states , and in ref .",
    "we thus developed techniques for calculating the first few cumulants of markovian systems with many states , for example nano - electromechanical systems.@xcite in ref .  , braggio and co - workers generalized the approach by bagrets and nazarov by including non - markovian effects that may arise for example when the coupling to the electronic leads is not weak .",
    "the methods presented in these papers were subsequently unified and extended in ref .  , where we presented a general approach to calculations of cumulants of arbitrary order for systems with many states as well as with non - markovian dynamics .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to provide a detailed derivation and description of this method , which recently has been used in a number of works,@xcite as well as to illustrate its use with three examples of current experimental relevance .",

    "[ sec : non - markov ] we introduce the generic non - markovian generalized master equation ( gme ) which is the starting point of this work .",

    "numerical differentiation , however , is notoriously unstable , and often one can only obtain accurate results for the first few derivatives with respect to the counting field , i.  e.  the cumulants . in order to circumvent this problem , we develop a numerically stable recursive scheme based on a perturbation expansion in the counting field .",

    "we study the large deviation function of the system,@xcite which describes the tails of the distribution of measurable currents , and discuss how it is related to the cumulants .",
    "the second example concerns charge transport coupled to quantized mechanical vibrations as considered in a recent series of papers on transport through single molecules@xcite and other nano - electromechanical systems.@xcite due to the many oscillator states participating in transport the matrix representations of the involved operators are of large dimensions and it is necessary to resort to numerics .",
    "we demonstrate the numerical stability of our recursive algorithm up to very high cumulant orders ( @xmath0 ) and show how oscillations of the cumulants can be used to extract information about the analytic structure of the cumulant generating function .",
    "we calculate the large deviation function and show that it is highly sensitive to the damping of the vibrational mode .",
