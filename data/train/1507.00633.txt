    "in particle accelerators , physicists routinely accelerate elementary particles and bring them to collision .",
    "baados , silk and west ( bsw ) @xcite have proposed a scenario , where black holes may act as particle accelerators and first showed that the collision of geodesic particles in the vicinity of a black hole horizon yields a total unbounded centre of mass ( cm ) energy .",
    "this amounts to a natural collision process similar to the artificially tested process in the high - energy laboratory at cern .",
    "the difference is that the latter is under strict human control albeit a bit too expensive process whereas the former one is free of charge , occurring in cosmos frequently as an ordinary event .",
    "not only do the black holes create a similar bsw effect , but also naked singularities as well as the throat regions of wormholes @xcite .",
    "rotating black holes and wormholes act more efficiently in comparison with static ones to yield a high cm energy zas1,bobir , zas2,zas3,pradhan , pour , sadeghi , josji , joshi2,pavlov , stuchlik , zas4,gao , liu , zaslavskii6 .",
    "another aspect of the bsw effect is that it occurs irrespective of the dimensionality of spacetime or the nature of the underlying theory .",
    "that is , even in lower / higher dimensions of 3 + 1- spacetime we can have an accelerator effectzas3,schh , zav2,ayesha , zav , zaavv2,josji3,wei , adami , harada , malafarina , west , anton , sheoran , tanatarov , piran , sotiriou , lake , nunes , grib , grib2,chenn , ghoshh , debnath , jing , dingliu . from this token",
    "we have shown recently that in 1 + 1- dimensional hoava - lifshitz theory of gravity @xcite , we did have the bsw effectali1 .",
    "collision must take place near the horizon of the formed black hole so that the particles get boost from the unlimited attraction of the black hole@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility of bsw effect in the modified einstein theory known as the @xmath0 gravity @xcite . in this theory the einstein - hilbert action characterized by the ricci scalar ( r ) is extended to cover an arbitrary function of r. theoretically such a concept has an infinite number of extensions which are to be severely restricted by experimental tests .",
    "naturally any higher power of r hosts higher order derivatives of the metric and expectedly obtaining exact solutions is not an easy task at all .",
    "the solution for @xmath0 gravity that we shall consider in this study is a static one with @xmath5 , in which the constant @xmath6 , so that our model of @xmath0 has no vacuum einstein limit . by comparison with the schwarzchild - de sitter line element",
    "the second integration constant @xmath7 can be interpreted as a cosmological constant .",
    "in the first part we shall choose @xmath3 with @xmath8 , so that our solution will represent a black hole .",
    "near its horizon we shall show that collision of particles moving in opposite directions exhibits bsw effect .",
    "next , we assume that @xmath9 and repeat the similar calculation that yields again an unbounded cm energy .",
    "however , if the particles move in the same radial direction there is no such effect . in the following stage of our study",
    "we choose @xmath10 ( with @xmath8 ) and consider the collision process in the vicinity of @xmath11 , which stands for a naked singularity .",
    "it also provides unbounded cm energy ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "in contrast to mostly finite energy cases emergence of a zero total energy is not to be encountered in other collision processes .",
    "another piece of work that we take into consideration is the analogue of a compton process in which an infalling particle collides with an outgoing photon",
    ". note that by photon it is meant a massless particle following a null geodesics .",
    "the source of the photon can be attributed to the hawking process whereby both massless and massive emissions from the black hole through tunneling are admissible .",
    "it is observed once more that the bsw effect occurs even with such photons .",
    "finally , head - on collision of two photons near a black hole is also shown to yield an unbounded energy , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bswplot3 ] .",
    "the outgoing photon may be considered to originate from a radiating charged mass accelerated toward the black hole .",
    "similarly the outgoing particle can be the outcome of the hawking process .",
    "furthermore , there are many  open questions that motivate our paper : how does the extension of the ricci scalar as a @xmath0  function affect the bsw mechanism ?",
    "whether such solutions lead to some important outcome ?",
    "hence , these regular solutions do have several interesting features and consequences on bsw mechanism .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii summarizes static spherically symmetric black holes in f(r ) gravity .",
    "collision of particles , mainly between radiating and infalling particles near the horizon of black holes , is analysed in section iii .",
    "section iv considers collisions involving photons , both outgoing and infalling .",
    "we complete the paper with our conclusion in section v.",
    "the action of general , sourceless @xmath0 gravity theories in four dimension is @xmath13 in which @xmath0 is the function of the scalar curvature @xmath14 , and @xmath15 stands for the determinant of the metric tensor @xcite .",
    "the spherically symmetric line element is given by    @xmath16    in which the function of @xmath0 @xmath17 with the constant @xmath18 yields the solution    @xmath19    with the ricci scalar    @xmath20    inclusion of a cosmological constant @xmath7 yields the function of the scalar curvature as follows @xcite @xmath21and the corresponding metric function of @xmath22 is @xmath23    with the scalar curvature@xmath24    note that the fact that @xmath6 is already revealed by the metric function @xmath22 . in the sequel for both cases , @xmath25 and @xmath26 we shall investigate the possibility of bsw effect .",
    "lastly , for the case of @xmath10 , ( @xmath25 ) which corresponds to a naked singular solution at @xmath11 we shall search for the collider effect .    obviously in the two parametric solution employed , @xmath7 is a dispensable parameter whereas @xmath2 not . that is",
    ", our choice of @xmath0 gravity lacks the einstein s general relativity limit . with deliberation",
    "we  have made such a choice to see the significance of the bsw effect in a @xmath27 model that is not connected with the general relativity .",
    "this is precisely the case with @xmath6 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the  @xmath28black holes in the @xmath27 gravity can act as particle accelerators . for different cases we investigate the cm energy for the collision ,  4-d velocity components of the colliding particles in the background of the 4-d @xmath0 black holes by taking the radial motion on equatorial plane ( @xmath29 ) ( fig .",
    "[ bswplot ] ) .",
    "our lagrangian is chosen by    @xmath30    in which a dot implies derivative with respect to proper time .",
    "the velocities follow as@xmath31    and@xmath32    where e and l are the energy and angular momentum constants , respectively .",
    "we may also add that although l can be anything we shall make the choice @xmath33 , so that our geodesics are almost radial .",
    "this will be our general trend in the sequel .",
    "after that , by using the normalization condition ( @xmath34 ) , it is found that the radial velocity is@xmath35    and clearly we are interested in time - like geodesics .",
    "we proceed now to present the cm energy of two particles with four - velocities @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "other possibility is  when choosing @xmath52 where there are opposite particles with their angular momenta close to zero ( @xmath58 ) i.e. pure radial geodesics . in this case",
    "it yields@xmath59 .",

    "the second case of interest is for the chosen @xmath0 black hole model with a cosmological constant in which the metric function a is @xmath65    where the event horizon is located at @xmath66    for @xmath67    at this point we must add that we are not interested in the other roots of @xmath68 that specify the inner horizon .",
    "it is observed that for real @xmath69 we must have @xmath70 , which restricts the cosmological constant to the case of @xmath71 .",
    "the center of mass energy for the case of colliding ingoing and outgoing particles is obtained with reference to ( [ 25 ] ) as    @xmath72    it is clear that  as a goes to zero at the horizon , it diverges ( @xmath73 . so there is a bsw  effect .  on the other hand , the case @xmath56 demands that the center of mass energy @xmath57is finite .",
    "there is a naked singularity for our @xmath0 model at the location of @xmath11 , with @xmath10,where the metric function  is given by ( let @xmath25 )    @xmath74    as it is calculated above the collision of two particles generally is @xmath75 upon taking the lowest order terms in the vicinity of the horizon , since @xmath76 , we can make the expansion   @xmath77    when r goes to zero , the center of mass energy also goes to infinity for radially moving particles @xmath78    this suggests that the particles are boosted by the naked singularity and strictly there is a bsw  effect near such a singularity .",
    "inclusion of the angular momenta @xmath46 and @xmath47 , however , leads to a divergent energy near the naked singularity .",
    "the massless photon coming from the hawking radiation can naturally scatter an infalling particle or vice versa ( fig .",

    "the center of mass energy near horizon limit is given for the metric function ( [ metricfunc ] ) as    @xmath102    so that when @xmath99 and @xmath52 ( or @xmath103from@xmath104 ) , it diverges @xmath101    thus , there is also a bsw effect for a compton- like scattering near the @xmath27  black holes with cosmological constant .",
    "last case is when the @xmath0  has naked singularity .",

    "we should add , however , that physically this case is of little interest since neither the photon nor the particle has the chance to escape from a naked singularity .",
    "as a final example we consider the problem of collision between two photons in the vicinity of our @xmath0 black hole ( fig . [ bswplot3 ] ) .",
    "the photons follow null geodesics in opposite directions and make head - on collision . in quantum electrodynamics colliding energetic photons can transmute into particles . since our analysis here is entirely classical we shall refer only to the center of mass energy of the yield without further specification .",

    "this naturally follows a null geodesics .",
    "their corresponding centre of mass energy diverges ( @xmath118 ) , consequently for  two colliding photons we obtain a bsw effect .",

    "the latter develops null- singularities after the collision process .",
