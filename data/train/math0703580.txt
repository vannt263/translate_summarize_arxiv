    "the isometry problem or more specifically the isometrical deformation problem of surfaces in a 3-dimensional euclid space form preserving mean curvature has been studied by a number of mathematicians .",
    "one of the first mathematicians who has studied this subject is bonnet @xcite .",
    "bonnet , after pointing out that the isometry problem of a surface preserving mean curvature can not be solved in the general case , showed that all surfaces with constant mean curvature can be isometrically mapped to each other and deformable surfaces with non constant mean curvature are isothermic weingarten surfaces which can be deformable to the revolution surfaces .",
    "cartan @xcite considered the problem as an application of differential forms and after rather long calculations , classified weingarten surfaces which can be deformable to the revolution surfaces and showed that there are finite number surfaces in each class .",
    "recently , this problem has been reconsidered .",
    "chern @xcite , using differential forms , obtained a characterization for an isometrical deformation preserving mean curvature .",
    "roussos @xcite who has many works on this subject , using chern s method , in the general case , obtained a characterization for the isometry preserving mean curvature .",

    "the surface which admits an isometry - preserving mean curvature is called bonnet surface .",
    "one of the bonnet surfaces which can be isometrically mapped to each other is called bonnet associate of the other surface .",
    "similar definitions are valid for the bonnet hypersurfaces .",
    "kokubu @xcite considered deformable bonnet hypersurfaces and showed that they consist of bonnet surfaces in @xmath3 and bonnet hypersurfaces in @xmath4 .",
    "later , soyuok @xcite examined the problem of determining bonnet surfaces in @xmath3 and showed that a surface is a bonnet surface if and only if a surface has a special isothermal parameter system .",
    "moreover , as an application of this , he obtained cartan s results and explained geometrically why there are a finite number of surfaces in the classes determined by cartan .",
    "soyuok @xcite , in another work , examined the problem determining bonnet hypersurfaces in @xmath4 and obtained quantities of these hypersurfaces .",
    "furthermore , he showed that a 3-dimensional hypersurface is a bonnet hypersurface if and only if it has a special orthogonal net .",
