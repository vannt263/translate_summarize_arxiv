    "many theoretical models predict that neutrinos are generated by hadronic processes within high energy astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , supernova remnants or gamma ray bursts .",
    "individual sources might be too weak to produce an unambiguous directional signal , however the total neutrino flux from all sources could produce a detectable diffuse neutrino signal .",
    "astrophysical neutrinos generated in top - down models are , by definition , of diffuse nature . to date",
    "the highest sensitivities to diffuse neutrino fluxes in a range 10 tev @xmath5 100 pev are achieved with the nt200(baikal ) @xcite and amanda @xcite neutrino telescopes .",
    "the baikal neutrino telescope nt200 is operating in lake baikal at a depth of 1.1 km and is taking data since 1998 .",
    "since 2005 , the upgraded 10-mton scale detector nt200 + is in operation . detector configuration and performance",
    "have been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "due to high water transparency and low light scattering , the detection volume of nt200 for high energy @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 events significantly exceeds the instrumented volume .",
    "our previous analysis @xcite of 1038 live - days data , collected in the years 1998 - 2002 with nt200 , has allowed to set the limits on diffuse neutrino fluxes predicted by several theoretical models . here",
    "we discuss a new analysis method which is based on an energy and space - angular reconstruction of high - energy cascades and present limits on diffuse neutrino fluxes which are improved by a factor of about three over the previous ones .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the baikal survey for high energy neutrinos searches for bright cascades produced at the neutrino interaction vertex in a large volume around and below the telescope .",
    "the main background source are atmospheric muons , with a flux @xmath9 times higher than that of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we select events with high multiplicity of hit channels @xmath10 , corresponding to bright cascades . to separate high - energy neutrino events from background events , a cut to select events with upward moving light signals has been developed .",
    "we define for each event @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the arrival times at channels @xmath13 on each string , and the minimum over all strings is calculated .",
    "positive and negative values of @xmath14 correspond to upward and downward propagation of light , respectively .",
    "we require @xmath15 this cut accepts only time patterns corresponding to up - ward traveling light signals .",
    "it rejects most events from brem - cascades produced by downward going muons since the majority of muons is close to the vertical ; they would cross the detector or pass nearby and generate a downward time pattern . only few muons with large zenith angles",
    "may escape this cut and illuminate the array by their own cherenkov radiation or that from bright cascades from below .",
    "the energy spectrum of neutrinos from galactic and cosmological sources or from the decay of topological defects is expected to have a significantly flatter shape than the spectrum of atmospheric muons and neutrinos .",
    "this gives rise to different @xmath16 and cascades energy distributions .",
    "results of a search for high - energy neutrinos , based on @xmath16 as a rough indicator of the energy deposited in the effective detection volume were published in @xcite . here",
    "we present results of an extended analysis which is based on a full reconstruction of cascades parameters .",
    "we use a two step procedure for cascade parameters reconstruction which is applied to events with @xmath17 hit channels . at the first step , using the time information of hit channels , the coordinates of the cascade vertex are reconstructed by minimizing @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the time measured by the @xmath20-th channel , @xmath21 is the expected arrival time of cherenkov photons induced by a cascade with @xmath22 coordinates , and @xmath23 are the timing errors . at the next step ,",
    "taking into account the found coordinates @xmath22 , we reconstruct the cascades energy @xmath24 , as well as zenith and azimuth angles @xmath25 and @xmath26 of cascade axis by maximizing the likelihood function @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the probability to detect a signal of amplitude @xmath29 by the @xmath20-th hit channel .",
    "these probability functions are calculated with taking into account the absorption and scattering of light in water and the relative orientations of optical modules and cascades .",

    "downward going atmospheric muons are the most important source of background .",

    "the data are consistent with simulated background for both @xmath14 and @xmath10 distributions .",
    "a full cascade reconstruction algorithm ( for vertex , direction , energy ) was applied to the data @xcite .",
    "cuts were then placed on this reconstructed cascade energy to select neutrino events .",
    "the reconstructed zenith - angule and energy distributions of data are shown in fig.1 ( dots ) .",
    "eight events were reconstructed as upward going cascades ( zenith angle @xmath65 in the left panel and the distribution in the dashed box in right panel ) .",
    "also the mc - generated ( histograms ) and reconstructed ( boxes ) zenith - angule and energy distributions from simulated atmospheric muons are shown in fig.1 ; 12 upward reconstructed cascade - like events are expected . as seen from fig.1 , within systematic and statistical uncertainties",
    "there is no significant excess above the background from atmospheric muons .",
    "we introduce the following final neutrino signal cuts on the cascade energy : e@xmath66130 tev and e@xmath6610 tev for downward ( 40@xmath6790@xmath68 ) and upward going cascades , respectively ( see for details @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , events which fulfil selection requirements used in our previous analysis @xcite are also considered as neutrino candidates .",
    "with zero observed events and 2.3@xmath691.2 expected background events , a 90% confidence level upper limit on the number of signal events of @xmath702.4 is obtained .    a model of astrophysical neutrino sources , for which the total number of expected events , @xmath71 , is larger than @xmath72 , is ruled out at 90% cl .",

    "the model by stecker @xcite labeled `` s05 '' , represents models for neutrino production in the central region of active galactic nuclei .",

    "fig.2 shows our upper limit on the all - flavor @xmath78 diffuse flux , which is a significant improvement of the earlier obtained limit @xcite .",

    "the neutrino telescope nt200 in lake baikal is taking data since april 1998 .",
    "due to high water transparency and low light scattering , the detection volume of nt200 for high energy neutrino events is several megatons and significantly exceeds the instrumented volume .",
    "this results in a high sensitivity to diffuse neutrino fluxes from extraterrestrial sources  more than an order of magnitude better than that of underground searches and similar to the published limits of the amanda neutrino telescope .",
