    "the present study extends this work through the use of a dynamical quark model which allows for su(6 ) symmetry breaking in the baryon wavefunctions , and also for non - spectator effects  @xcite , where the interactions of a pair of quarks with a given flavor and total spin are allowed to depend on the flavor and spin of the remaining quark .",
    "our study also differs numerically through the use of different experimental input .",
    "we will show that these two different approaches give quite different results for the @xmath11 masses , which implies an inconsistency between the measurements of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 breit - wigner masses , the extracted value of @xmath16 , and our prediction based on large @xmath1 and the quark model . in section iv , we will show that the @xmath17 mass splitting based on pole mass values is more consistent with quark model and large @xmath1 expectations .",

    "the pairing models of baryon isospin splittings of cutkosky  @xcite and rosner  @xcite assume the universality of splittings of a given type within the ground state octet and decuplet baryons .",
    "this amounts to the assumption of su(6 ) flavor - spin symmetry in the wavefunctions , although the interactions must be allowed to depend on the light - strange quark mass difference and so break su(3)@xmath36 .",

    "dynamical models such as that used here  @xcite and by isgur  @xcite allow for breaking of su(6 ) symmetry in the wavefunctions and so allow for and calculate non - spectator effects .",
    "however , these models neglect potentially important additional effects due to electromagnetic box and penguin graphs , as shown by stephenson , maltman , and goldman  @xcite , and these may also contribute to non - spectator effects .",
    "it is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that isospin splittings in the hyperons are much larger than for the @xmath43 and @xmath11 baryons due to cancellations between pair terms in the latter which are not present in the former .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath43 and @xmath11 splittings may be sensitive to non - spectator effects , which may not necessarily show the same cancellations .",
    "it is therefore important to include these effects when examining the @xmath11 , @xmath15 , and @xmath14 mass splittings in a model ( such as ours ) constrained to fit the @xmath44 and other isospin splittings .",
    "note that certain of the mass relations based on large-@xmath1 and perturbative flavor breaking mentioned here are either satisfied by construction or by virtue of the assumption of su(6 ) symmetry in the wavefunctions of the model of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , and that our model allows for explicit breaking of these relations .    as an example of such an effect , any model which consistently treats the hyperfine contact interaction and the isospin splittings will predict that the @xmath45 splitting is slightly larger than @xmath44 , because the effect of @xmath46 on the quark kinetic energy is less diluted by relativistic effects in the @xmath11 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath47 is smaller than @xmath48 for a finite quark momentum @xmath49 .",
    "the nucleon has a net attractive contact interaction which gives the quarks a larger mean momentum , whereas the @xmath11 has a repulsive contact interaction .",
    "slight differences in the magnitude of the electrostatic and magnetic interactions introduce almost no difference between these two splittings .",
    "although they are somewhat reduced in magnitude in the larger @xmath11 state with slower moving quarks , these two terms come in with opposite sign and so the differences largely cancel .",
    "the relation @xmath50 from jenkins and lebed  @xcite and rosner  @xcite has an expected accuracy of @xmath51 , which is significantly lower order than , say , eq .",

    "@xcite for details ) . this can be interpreted as a strong form factor for the light constituent quarks , and this smearing parameter implies a relatively small strong size for the constituent quark . on the other hand , relativistic calculations of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon carried out with light - cone techniques require a substantially larger electromagnetic size for the constituent quark in order to fit the nucleon form factors using the resulting wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic component of the electromagnetic interaction _ between _ quarks , which is one source of isospin - violating mass splittings , was smeared in ref .",
    "@xcite , also with a substantially smaller smearing parameter @xmath57 than that used for the strong contact interaction .",
    "this implies that smaller smearing parameters should be used in the strong contact interaction , coupled with a larger strong coupling @xmath58 to preserve the size of the contact splittings .",
    "this reduces the level of high - momentum components in the nucleon , and therefore reduces the electromagnetic size of the quarks required to fit the nucleon moments , bringing the strong and electromagnetic constituent quark sizes into rough agreement .",
    "wavefunctions have been generated for the ground state octet and decuplet baryons with a strong contact interaction which is smeared with @xmath59 gev for light quark pairs [ with similar reductions for the @xmath60 and @xmath61 quark pairs ] , and with an increased @xmath62 , which result in a fit to the ground state baryon and the entire light - quark baryon spectra of similar quality to that of ref .",

    "@xcite . a value of @xmath16 this large is also disfavored in our quark model .",

    "note that this argument is based on the difficulty of accommodating substantially unequal values of @xmath39 and @xmath76 in the quark model . in our quark model both @xmath76 and @xmath39 have negligible contributions from the dependence of the kinetic energy and strong interactions on the @xmath90 mass difference .",

    "we will return to this point in section  [ sec : bw ] .",
    "as our analysis of the @xmath11 isobar masses depends crucially on the relations in eqs .",
    "( [ d_3 ] ) and  ( [ d2s*2 ] ) , it is of some interest to test the predicted accuracy of these and other relations based  @xcite on large-@xmath1 and perturbative flavor breaking with a dynamic quark model which includes su(3)@xmath36 breaking effects , as well as su(6 ) symmetry breaking and effects higher order in the isospin - symmetry violating quantities such as @xmath93 .",
    "certain of these relations can not be compared to experiment due to large experimental uncertainties , particularly in the splittings of the @xmath11 states .",
    "our quark model can provide estimates for the level of accuracy of such relations .",
    "we have already seen above that the most highly suppressed @xmath94 and @xmath95 operators from ref .",

    "we have @xmath102 mev , which corresponds to an accuracy of @xmath103 , which compares favorably with the predicted accuracy of this relation from ref .",
    "@xcite of @xmath104 .",
    "similarly , the coleman - glashow relation @xmath105 is satisfied by our quark model to within 0.03 mev , which corresponds to an accuracy of @xmath106 , and is predicted to be accurate  @xcite to @xmath107 in the large-@xmath1 and su(3)@xmath36 limit .",
    "two additional @xmath97 relations from ref .  @xcite with an expected accuracy of @xmath108 are @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and are both rather poorly satisfied by our dynamical model , which has @xmath111 mev , which corresponds to an accuracy of @xmath112 , and @xmath113 mev which corresponds to an accuracy of @xmath114 .",
    "a similar lack of agreement is obtained for a wide range of parameters .",
    "both of these relations are derived  @xcite using a mass relation which does not correspond to a single su(6 ) representation .",
    "this suggests that some mass relations which span more than one su(6 ) representation , and those derived from them , may not be consistent with our dynamical model .",
    "it is interesting to note that our quark model fit _ without _ imposition of constraints from the @xmath11 masses gives a value @xmath115 mev , close to the pedroni _",
    "_ value @xmath89 mev .",
    "this is also true of the fit of cutkosky  @xcite .",
    "if instead of using the breit - wigner masses to determine @xmath17 we use the pole masses  @xcite , we find a smaller splitting @xmath116 a similar result for this splitting was found by cutkosky@xcite in a fit to the octet and decuplet baryons which excluded the @xmath11 masses .",
    "evaluating eq .",
    "( [ ddiffd2s2 ] ) with the pole mass difference and our value of @xmath74 gives @xmath117 which is at least compatible with our quark model expectation that @xmath45 should be slightly larger than @xmath66 mev , though the uncertainty associated with pole mass splittings can not support any more quantitative conclusions .",
    "this naturally leads one to consider whether pole or breit - wigner masses should be used in mass relations .",
    "as has been pointed out by hhler@xcite , the pole position ( and not the breit - wigner mass ) is a quantity which can be most rigorously associated with a resonance .",
    "one obvious way to address this question is to use the best @xmath118 mass relation from ref .",
    "@xcite with an expected accuracy of @xmath119 , @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the average of the isobar masses of baryon @xmath122 .",
    "this leads , unfortunately , to a central value between the @xmath2 breit - wigner and pole ( 1210 mev ) masses . however , dillon has noted@xcite that the consistency of eq .",
    "( [ d_0 ] ) with the @xmath11 pole masses is improved if pole values@xcite are used consistently for each particle .",
    "this distinction has no effect on the @xmath123 mass , but does shift the @xmath124 and @xmath125 terms slightly . here again , improved values for the @xmath14 ( and @xmath126 ) breit - wigner and pole masses would lead to a corresponding improvement in our understanding of the @xmath2 .",
    "while the @xmath2 `` mass '' has been variously quoted near 1210 mev , 1232 mev , and even 1241 mev@xcite , the differences are mainly due to model dependence in the separation of resonance and background contributions .",
    "the pole position remains stable near 1210@xmath12750 mev in all of these works . as an exercise",
    ", we have repeated our quark model calculation of the isospin splittings but with the strong contact interaction altered to fit @xmath128 evaluated with the @xmath11 pole mass , leaving all other details of the model unchanged .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath44 , @xmath16 , and @xmath129 were largely unchanged at @xmath130 mev , @xmath131 mev , and @xmath132 mev respectively , although the magnitudes of the splittings @xmath133 ,  @xmath134 , and @xmath135 were reduced .",
    "this simple exercise suggests that it may be possible to accommodate the average pole masses and their difference in a quark model of this kind .",
    "two different constructions for the @xmath11 isobar masses are compared .",
    "both are based on the well determined @xmath3 and @xmath4 masses , and a relation based on perturbative flavor breaking and large-@xmath1 , with an expected very high degree of accuracy realized in our dynamical quark model .",
    "the additional constraint is taken to be either a combination of @xmath11 masses extracted from @xmath12 deuteron elastic scattering data , or a second large-@xmath1 relation in combination with a quark model calculation .",
    "the expected high degree of accuracy of this second large-@xmath1 relation is also realized in our explicit quark model .",
    "if the breit - wigner @xmath3 and @xmath4 masses are adopted , these two different constructions are in conflict .",
    "the quark model relation , upon which this conflict is based , is a basic consequence of the type of model used , and does not depend sensitively on parameter values .",
    "the accuracy of certain relations based on perturbative flavor breaking and large-@xmath1 is unknown because of uncertainties in the masses extracted from the data .",
    "we have found that in most cases the predicted accuracy is realized in our model .",
    "the exceptions are relations which are not restricted to a single su(6 ) representation .",
    "we have also shown that the relations between masses based on perturbative flavor breaking and large-@xmath1 and those derived from the quark model are more consistent with the @xmath11 pole masses than the corresponding breit - wigner values .",
    "this suggests that @xmath5 mev and the pole mass difference @xmath136 mev are consistent with theoretical expectations .",
    "we support rosner s assertion that improved @xmath14 and @xmath126 masses are vitally important .",
    "these would sharpen comparisons between the large-@xmath1 and quark model predictions and allow more quantitative comparisons between mass relations using breit - wigner and pole masses .",
    "with one additional @xmath11 mass , we could use eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) to determine the remaining state , bypassing the deuteron data . while the @xmath80 mass determined from pion photoproduction data",
    "is the most obvious candidate , we should point out a potential problem .",
    "this is most obvious if we rewrite eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) in the form @xmath137 which would be utilized , given the @xmath3 and @xmath4 masses . since @xmath3 has a larger uncertainty than @xmath4 and the ` expected ' @xmath138 splitting is only about 1.5 mev , we could easily have an experimental @xmath138 splitting consistent with zero .",
    "this uncertainty would then be magnified in our estimate of the @xmath79 mass .",
    "while a direct measurement of the @xmath79 mass would have the greatest impact , it is unfortunately the least favorable experiment , involving the extraction of @xmath139 scattering from a deuteron target .",
