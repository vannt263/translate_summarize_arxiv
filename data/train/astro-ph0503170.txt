    "the _ spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic legacy program ( swire ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is expected to detect over two million galaxies at infrared wavelengths from 3.6 to @xmath16 over @xmath17 and to redshifts @xmath18 .",
    "our elais - n1 sample corresponds to a completeness of @xmath19% and we used a @xmath1 central region where the completeness was uniform to within @xmath20 .",
    "reliability of each @xmath2 detection was ensured by requiring an irac @xmath21 association with snr @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 ) and separation @xmath24 .",
    "stars were identified and rejected using a combination of the @xmath21 stellarity index ( @xmath25 ) and cuts in @xmath26 versus @xmath27 flux ratio ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this study is the first of its kind at this wavelength and sensitivity , reaching a factor of @xmath28 deeper in flux density than the iras @xmath29 galaxy surveys .",
    "the method of counts - in - cells ( cics ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) provides the full galaxy count distribution function within a cell of given size , and its moments are related to the classical @xmath30-point correlations . the variance in particular",
    "is related to the cell - averaged _ two - point _ correlation function .",
    "the advantage of cics over traditional , direct binning methods is that the data does not require binning , moments from cics have better signal - to - noise ratio properties , no random comparison sample is needed , and systematics from catalog boundaries and finite sampling are better handled .",
    "figure [ fig ] ( left panel ) shows the angular - averaged correlation function as a function of cell diameter .",
    "the angular range corresponds to _ comoving _ scales of @xmath31mpc at the expected median redshift of @xmath32 for the full sample , as predicted from the @xcite model and @xmath33 .",
    "the striking feature is that redder ( mid - ir excess ) galaxies exhibit a stronger projected clustering than blue galaxies on scales @xmath15 .",
    "this difference is difficult to explain by varying projection effects since their _ photometric _ redshift distributions ( although incomplete ) are not too dissimilar .",
    "more work is needed to verify this .",
    "we have estimated correlation lengths by inverting limber s equation with three different model redshift distributions and assuming a simple evolution model for 3d clustering : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a proper coordinate and @xmath36 implies constant ( stable ) clustering in proper coordinates .",
    "we found spatial correlation lengths in the range @xmath37 to @xmath38mpc for the full sample assuming @xmath36 ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) . for the redshift model of @xcite ,",
    "whose predictions agree remarkably well with observed @xmath2 counts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find @xmath10mpc .",
    "we also found that red galaxies are more clustered by a factor of @xmath39 in their spatial correlation amplitude on @xmath40mpc scales at @xmath41 than blue galaxies ( not shown ) .",
    "this may suggest that merger driven starbursts are dominating the mid - infrared excess population at @xmath42 .",
    "we note however that our 3d clustering estimates depend strongly on the assumed redshift distribution .",
    "this reinforces the need to establish the redshift distribution of swire galaxies .",
