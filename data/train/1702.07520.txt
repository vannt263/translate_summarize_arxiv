    "there has been considerable interest recently in the expected magnitude and shape of the fission aggregate antineutrino spectra emitted from reactors .",
    "this interest has been driven by the fact that reevaluations @xcite of the spectra for all four actinides ( @xmath0u , @xmath1u , @xmath2pu and @xmath3pu ) contributing to reactor antineutrino fluxes led to a systematic increase in the expected number of antineutrinos above about 2 mev , relative to earlier evaluations @xcite , which , in turn , led to the so - called reactor neutrino anomaly @xcite .",
    "the changes in the evaluated spectra were in part due to changes in the treatment of sub - dominant corrections to nuclear beta decay , particularly the treatment of the finite - size and weak - magnetism corrections .",
    "there are four sub - dominant corrections to beta decay that must be considered in calculating the antineutrino spectra .",
    "these are the recoil , radiative , finite - size , and weak - magnetism corrections .",
    "the recoil correction is quite small , and the radiative correction has been taken from the work of sirlin @xcite , both before and since the occurrence of the anomaly . in the earlier work of schreckenbach _",
    "@xcite , the finite - size and weak - magnetism corrections were applied to the aggregate fission antineutrino spectrum as a single energy - dependent correction to the entire spectrum , whereas in the reevaluations @xcite these corrections were applied for each end - point energy ( or end - point energy range ) contributing to the spectrum . in all cases , the finite - size and weak - magnetism corrections that were applied involve some level of approximation .",
    "for example , the finite - size correction is often taken to be the form appropriate for allowed beta decay transitions although it is well recognized @xcite that about 30% of the transitions making up the antineutrino spectra are forbidden . in the case of the 70% allowed transitions ,",
    "the expression @xcite for the finite - size correction has been found @xcite to be reasonably accurate .",
    "for the weak magnetism correction , there is both a one - body and two - body contribution . as discussed in detail below , in case of the one - body weak - magnetism correction , both a spin @xmath4 and orbital angular momentum @xmath5 operator enter , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 for nucleon @xmath8 .",
    "thus , in general , the weak - magnetism correction is nuclear structure dependent .",
    "however , in most analyses of reactor antineutrino spectra @xcite , the nuclear structure dependence is simplified by assuming that matrix elements of the orbital angular momentum operator are proportional to matrix elements of the spin operator , i.e. , it is assumed that @xmath9 .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to check the validity of the latter nuclear structure assumptioni , particularly for allowed fission fragment beta - decays .      in earlier work @xcite",
    ", we examined the usual approximations made for the finite - size correction to allowed beta decay by evaluating the zemach moments using energy density functional theory , and found these approximations to be good  @xcite .",
    "the approximations made for the weak - magnetism correction are of an entirely different origin , and need to be assessed separately .",
    "weak magnetism is generally a small correction to beta - decay , that arises to first order from an interference term between the dominant gamow - teller contribution and the magnetic dipole contribution to the weak current .",
    "the magnetic dipole operator , @xmath10 , involves the sum of three terms in the vector current @xmath11 , namely , the spin current , the orbital current , and meson - exchange currents . @xmath12 the label  mec \" indicates leading - order meson - exchange currents , which are dominated by pion - exchange , and whose form are not a subject of the current work .",
    "we note that , unless matrix elements of @xmath13 are suppressed , the first term in eq.([mu - terms ] ) tends to dominate because the vector magnetic moment is large compared to unity , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "the first order contribution from the weak magnetism correction @xmath15 to the beta - decay spectrum for allowed and and first forbidden decays is given in ref .",

    "; they are discussed in the review @xcite .    in several references",
    "@xcite , a simple model was used in which the orbital angular momentum of the @xmath21 nucleon @xmath22 was replaced by @xmath23 , and it was argued that any change in the quantum numbers of the @xmath24-decaying nucleon would eliminate the @xmath25 term , so that this term could be dropped .",
    "this simple model effectively assumes that @xmath26 in eq.([wm ] ) . examining the validity of this approximation , which replaces the fractional contribution from the orbital currents by  -1/2 \" in the expression for weak - magnetism correction , is the central focus of the present work .",
    "in addition , we examine whether matrix elements of the operator @xmath13 truly dominate over those for the orbital angular momentum operator @xmath27 , for the set of transitions relevant to reactor antineutrino spectra .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the simple case of pure single - particle matrix elements ( spme ) for the spin and orbital currents involved in the weak - magnetism correction . in this case , the fractional orbital correction is , @xmath28 where  @xmath29 \" and  @xmath30 \" are the single particle orbits involved in the initial and final states , and @xmath31 for the allowed transitions .",
    "we introduce the following short - hand notation : with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we use the signs in these definitions to stand for @xmath34 and @xmath35 in @xmath36 ( eq .  ( [ bigeq ] ) ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath37 stands for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and _",
    "etc._. from the analytical expressions for the @xmath40 symbols , listed in ref .",

    "this is particularly true for spin - orbit partners .",

    "<S> the weak magnetism correction and its uncertainty to nuclear beta - decay play a major role in determining the significance of the reactor neutrino anomaly . here </S>",
    "<S> we examine the common approximation used for one - body weak magnetism in the calculation of fission antineutrino spectra , wherein matrix elements of the orbital angular momentum operator contribution to the magnetic dipole current are assumed to be proportional to those of the spin operator . </S>",
    "<S> although we find this approximation invalid for a large set of nuclear structure situations , we conclude that it is valid for the relevant allowed beta - decays between fission fragments . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the uncertainty in the fission antineutrino due to the uncertainty in the one - body weak magnetism correction is found to be less than 1% . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the dominant uncertainty from weak magnetism for reactor neutrino fluxes lies in the uncertainty in the two - body meson - exchange magnetic dipole current . </S>"
