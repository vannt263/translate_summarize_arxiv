    "in this note we shall prove the following .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is a weakly contact hypersurface in a closed , connected , semipositive ( see remark  [ remark : semipositive ] ) symplectic manifold @xmath1 .",
    "then the rational gromov - witten invariants of @xmath1 satisfy @xmath2 ) \\cup \\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\ldots,\\alpha_k ; \\beta ) = 0\\ ] ] for all @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "let us recall the relevant definitions before discussing the consequences .",
    "we say that a hypersurface @xmath0 in a symplectic manifold @xmath1 is a weakly contact hypersurface if it admits a co - oriented contact structure  @xmath7 such that , denoting by @xmath8 the canonical conformally symplectic structure on  @xmath7 , @xmath9 defines a ray of symplectic structures on the vector bundle @xmath10 . as a special case ,",
    "this is satisfied whenever @xmath0 admits a contact form that extends to a neighborhood as a primitive of  @xmath11 , which is the standard notion of a contact type hypersurface .",
    "the weakly contact condition is more general ( e.g.  it does not require @xmath12 to be exact ) and corresponds to the definition of a _ weak symplectic filling _ introduced in @xcite ; as shown there , it is equivalent to the condition that @xmath11 should tame an almost complex structure  @xmath13 for which @xmath0 is a @xmath13-convex hypersurface .",
    "the _ gromov - witten invariants _ of a symplectic manifold @xmath1 associate to each pair of integers @xmath14 with @xmath15 and each homology class @xmath4 a homomorphism @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the deligne - mumford compactification of the moduli space of riemann surfaces with genus  @xmath18 and @xmath19  marked points .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the poincar duality isomorphism . in the absence of transversality problems",
    ", @xmath21 is interpreted as a count of rigid unparametrized @xmath13-holomorphic curves of genus  @xmath18 , for a generic @xmath11-tame almost complex structure  @xmath13 , with @xmath19 marked points such that for @xmath22 , the @xmath23th marked point is mapped to a generic smooth representative of @xmath24 , and the underlying conformal structure of the domain lies in a generic smooth representative of @xmath25 . in practice ,",
    "the transversality problems that arise in this definition can not generally be overcome without the introduction of abstract multivalued perturbations , thus one actually counts rationally weighted solutions to a perturbed cauchy - riemann type equation , and the count may be rational even if all the homology classes are integral . in this paper",
    ", we shall simplify matters by always assuming our symplectic manifold @xmath1 to be _ semipositive _ , a condition that excludes the existence of pseudoholomorphic spheres with negative first chern number .",
    "transversality problems can then be overcome by allowing generic domain - dependent almost complex structures , and the gromov - witten invariants take integer values , see e.g.  @xcite .    [",
    "remark : semipositive ] though we will not prove it here , the main theorem is almost certainly true without the semipositivity assumption , and this is why we have stated it with the word `` semipositive '' in parentheses .",
    "various approaches have been proposed for overcoming the analytical difficulties in defining the gromov - witten invariants , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "most recently , a rigorous definition was given in @xcite , using the polyfold machinery of hofer , wysocki and zehnder , and an earlier version of the present paper made the optimistic claim that the arguments given here can be carried out in that more general context .",
    "while that is probably true , subsequent discussions with hofer have led to the conclusion that it is not fully provable using the technology in its present state : in particular , homological intersection theory and poincar duality are not currently well enough understood in the polyfold context to justify equation   without semipositivity .",
    "i would like to thank joel fish and helmut hofer for helping clarify this point .",
    "recall that a closed symplectic manifold @xmath1 is said to be symplectically uniruled if it has a nonzero rational gromov - witten invariant with at least one pointwise constraint , i.e.  there exist @xmath4 , an integer @xmath3 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 such that @xmath28),\\alpha_2,\\ldots,\\alpha_k ; \\beta ) \\ne 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 \\in h_0(m)$ ] denotes the homology class of a point .",
    "morally , this means one can find a set of constraints so that there is always a nonzero count of constrained holomorphic spheres passing through a generic point .",
    "now observe that if @xmath30 is a nonseparating hypersurface , then @xmath31 \\ne 0 \\in h_*(m;{{\\mathbb q}})$ ] and one can therefore find a cohomology class @xmath32 with @xmath33 \\rangle \\ne 0 $ ] and hence @xmath34 ) \\cup",
    "\\alpha_1 = { \\operatorname{pd}}([{\\operatorname{pt}}]).\\ ] ] the main theorem then implies the following result .",
    "if @xmath1 is a closed ( semipositive ) symplectic manifold that is symplectically uniruled , then every weakly contact hypersurface in @xmath1 is separating .    some motivation to prove such a result comes from the weinstein conjecture , which states that any closed contact type hypersurface in a symplectic manifold has a closed orbit of its characteristic line field .",
    "there is a long history of results that prove this conjecture under various assumptions on the existence of holomorphic curves in the ambient symplectic manifold , cf .",
    "however , such results have often been proved only for _ separating _ contact hypersurfaces , leaving the question without this extra assumption open .",
    "our theorem thus shows that the extra assumption is superfluous , e.g.  combining it with guangcun lu s result , we obtain :    [ cor : weinstein ] if @xmath35 is a contact manifold that embeds into a symplectically uniruled symplectic manifold as a contact type hypersurface , then every contact form for @xmath35 admits a periodic reeb orbit , i.e.  the weinstein conjecture holds for  @xmath35 .    for more on symplectic manifolds to which this result applies ,",
    "see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "nonseparating contact type hypersurfaces do exist in general , though they are usually not easy to find .",
    "a construction in dimension  @xmath36 was suggested by etnyre and outlined in @xcite*example  1.3 : the idea is to start from a symplectic filling with two boundary components , attach a weinstein @xmath37-handle to form the boundary connected sum and then attach a symplectic cap to form a closed symplectic manifold , which contains both boundary components of the original symplectic filling as nonseparating contact hypersurfaces . at the time @xcite was written ,",
    "examples of symplectic fillings with disconnected boundary were known only up to dimension  6 ( due to mcduff @xcite , geiges @xcite and mitsumatsu @xcite ) , but recently a construction in all dimensions appeared in work of the author with massot and niederkrger @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that these examples can be combined with the symplectic capping result of lisca and mati @xcite*theorem  3.2 for stein fillable contact manifolds to construct examples of nonseparating contact hypersurfaces in all dimensions , but we will not pursue this any further here .    note that it is somewhat easier to find examples of _ weakly _ contact hypersurfaces that do not separate : for instance , considering the standard symplectic @xmath38 as a product of two symplectic @xmath39-tori , for any nonseparating loop @xmath40 the hypersurface @xmath41 admits an obvious foliation by symplectic @xmath39-tori , and this foliation can be perturbed to any of the tight contact structures on  @xmath42 ( cf .",
    "notice that one can not use the same trick to produce a nonseparating weakly contact hypersurface in @xmath43 with any product symplectic structure , as the latter is uniruled . can be proved by more elementary means without mentioning gromov - witten invariants , cf .",
    "@xcite*theorem  1.15 .",
    "] this implies the well known fact ( see  @xcite ) that the obvious foliation by spheres on @xmath44 can not be perturbed to a contact structure .",
    "the theorem of lu @xcite also establishes the weinstein conjecture for separating contact type hypersurfaces under the more general assumption @xmath45),\\alpha_2,\\ldots,\\alpha_k ; \\beta ) \\ne 0,\\ ] ] i.e.  one need not assume @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , using the more recent technology of `` stretching the neck '' @xcite , one can give a straightforward alternative proof of lu s result which also shows that any _ nonseparating _ contact hypersurface in a manifold satisfying must have a closed characteristic .",
    "note however that in the genus zero case , this is a weaker statement than corollary  [ cor : weinstein ] : it asserts that a _ particular _ contact form on @xmath47 admits a closed reeb orbit , but not that this is true for every possible choice of contact form .",
    "the obvious stretching argument does not appear to imply this stronger statement in general except when @xmath0 separates  @xmath48 .",
    "it seems unlikely moreover that our main result would hold under the more general assumption certainly the method of proof given below does not work , as it requires the fact that the relevant holomorphic curves in  @xmath48 can always be lifted to a cover ( since @xmath49 is simply connected ) .",
    "however , it was pointed out to me by guangcun lu that due to relations among gromov - witten invariants ( see @xcite*7 ) , certain conditions on higher genus invariants will imply that @xmath1 is also uniruled , e.g.  this is the case whenever there is a nontrivial invariant of the form @xmath50),\\alpha_2,\\ldots,\\alpha_k ; [ { \\operatorname{pt}}]).\\ ] ] the point here is that one counts curves with a fixed conformal structure on the domain , so one can derive holomorphic spheres from them by degenerating the conformal structure to `` pinch away '' the genus .",
    "note that in the above formulation of the weinstein conjecture for closed contact hypersurfaces , the ambient symplectic manifold need not be closed , e.g.  every contact manifold is a contact hypersurface in its own ( noncompact ) symplectization . as was shown in @xcite , there are many contact manifolds that do not admit any contact type embeddings into any closed symplectic manifold  as far as i am aware , all contact manifolds that are currently known to admit such embeddings are also symplectically fillable .",
    "i would like to thank guangcun lu for comments on a preliminary version of this paper , and patrick massot , helmut hofer and joel fish for useful conversations .",
    "the question considered here was brought to my attention by a talk of clment hyvrier about his recent paper @xcite at the _ sixth workshop on symplectic geometry , contact geometry and interactions _ in madrid , february 24 , 2012 .",
    "my approach to the proof owes a slight debt to an observation made by an anonymous referee for the paper @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is a closed , connected , semipositive symplectic manifold and @xmath30 is a weakly contact hypersurface . arguing by contradiction ,",
    "we assume there is a nontrivial rational gromov - witten invariant of the form @xmath51 ) \\cup \\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\ldots,\\alpha_k ; \\beta ) \\ne 0\\ ] ] for some @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . obviously @xmath31",
    "\\in h_*(m;{{\\mathbb q}})$ ] must then be nontrivial , so  @xmath0 is nonseparating .",
    "the essential idea of the proof will be to make  @xmath0 into a pseudoconvex hypersurface and show that implies the existence of a holomorphic sphere that touches it tangentially from the wrong side .",
    "we shall borrow an idea from @xcite and consider a connected infinite cover of  @xmath48 , defined by cutting @xmath48 open along  @xmath0 to produce a cobordism with boundary @xmath54 , and then gluing together an infinite chain of copies @xmath55 of this cobordism .",
    "specifically , if we denote for each @xmath56 the boundary of the cobordism @xmath57 by @xmath58 then each @xmath59 has a neighborhood in @xmath57 naturally identified with a suitable half - neighborhood of  @xmath0 in  @xmath48 , and we use these identifications to glue @xmath57 to @xmath60 along @xmath61 .",
    "this produces a smooth , connected and noncompact manifold ( see figure  [ fig : infinitechain ] ) @xmath62 which has a natural smooth covering projection @xmath63 and is separated by infinitely many copies of the hypersurface  @xmath0 , which we shall denote by @xmath64      since  @xmath65 is weakly contact , we can choose an @xmath11-tame almost complex structure  @xmath13 on  @xmath48 for which @xmath0 is a @xmath13-convex hypersurface , meaning that the maximal complex subbundle of @xmath66 is a contact structure and its canonical conformally symplectic structure also tames  @xmath13 .",
    "this almost complex structure can be lifted to @xmath67 as @xmath68    we must now make the meaning of more precise . as mentioned in  [ sec : statement ] , we shall use the definition for the semipositive case given in @xcite , though it is likely that the argument given below will be generalizable to the context of polyfolds once the latter theory is more fully developed .",
    "let @xmath69 denote the moduli space of unparametrized @xmath13-holomorphic spheres in  @xmath48 homologous to  @xmath70 with @xmath19 marked points .",
    "since this can not be assumed to be a smooth object due to multiply covered curves , we follow the prescription of @xcite and choose also a generic small perturbation of @xmath13 to a domain - dependent almost complex structure ; to keep the notation simple , we shall denote this perturbation by  @xmath71 .",
    "denote the resulting moduli space of solutions to the perturbed equation by @xmath72 .",
    "this is a smooth finite - dimensional manifold , and it has a natural compactification @xmath73 such that @xmath74 consists of strata of codimension at least  @xmath39 ( see @xcite for the precise meaning of this statement ) .",
    "thus for each @xmath22 , the natural _ evaluation maps _",
    "@xmath75 defined by sending a solution to its value at the @xmath23th marked point , define pseudocycles in the sense of @xcite .",
    "there is also a",

    "there are rational numbers @xmath80 and smooth submanifolds @xmath81 and @xmath82 such that @xmath83 & = \\beta \\in h_*(\\overline{{{\\mathcal m}}}_{0,k};{{\\mathbb q } } ) , \\\\",
    "c_i [ \\bar{\\alpha}_i ] & = { \\operatorname{pd}}(\\alpha_i ) \\in h_*(m;{{\\mathbb q } } )   \\quad \\text { for $ i=1,\\ldots , k$}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] define the smooth map @xmath84 after generic perturbations of the above submanifolds and of @xmath71 , the _ constrained moduli space _",

    "since the domains of the solutions in @xmath72 are spheres and thus simply connected , the loop @xmath88 provided by the lemma can be lifted to @xmath67 as a continuous family of spheres @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , the nontrivial intersection of @xmath90 with  @xmath0 implies that evaluation of @xmath91 at the first marked point traces a noncompact path in @xmath67 intersecting @xmath57 for every @xmath56 .",
    "it follows that there exists a parameter value @xmath92 for which the image of @xmath93 touches  @xmath94 but not the interior of  @xmath95 .",
    "the above is not yet a contradiction since @xmath93 is a solution to a perturbed problem and not an actual @xmath13-holomorphic curve , but we can now argue as follows . choosing a sequence @xmath96 of generic domain - dependent almost complex structures that converge to  @xmath13 as @xmath97 , the above argument gives for each",
