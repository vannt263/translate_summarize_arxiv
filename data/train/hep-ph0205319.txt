    "golec - biernat and wsthoff ( gbw ) have shown @xcite that a saturation model is able to describe the hera data for the proton structure function @xmath3 at small values of bjorken variable @xmath1 .",
    "the agreement of their model with the data is quite good for all available values of @xmath2 , including the lowest ones .",
    "the gbw model is based on a dipole picture of photon - proton interaction @xcite .",
    "its main ingredient is that at high energy , a particular frame can be chosen in which the interaction factorizes in two processes well separated in time .",
    "first the photon fluctuates in a @xmath4 pair of given transverse size @xmath5 , which then scatters off the proton . the factorized dipole - proton cross section @xmath6 contains the qcd evolution .",
    "it only depends on the size of the dipole @xmath5 and on the bjorken variable @xmath1 .",
    "the following parametrization was chosen by gbw : @xmath7 where it was assumed that the transverse momentum scale @xmath8 had a power - like dependence on @xmath1 : @xmath9 this choice was motivated by the following considerations .",
    "when @xmath10 , the model reduces to colour transparency .",
    "when one approaches the region @xmath11 , the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gbwmod ] ) takes care of resumming many gluon exchanges , in a glauber - inspired way . intuitively , this is what happens when the proton starts to look dark . in the region @xmath12 ,",
    "such a microscopic interpretation is no more valid but the exponential has the virtue to force the cross section to tend to a constant at large @xmath13 ( which also means at small values of @xmath1 because of the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath8 ) , thus respecting the unitarity constraint through a strict compliance with the froissart bound .",
    "these formulae involve 3 free parameters only , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "once those are determined by a fit to the @xmath0 data , one can take advantage of the universality of the dipole cross section to extend the model to more exclusive processes .",
    "diffractive structure functions @xcite are predicted in a quite satisfactory way .",
    "elastic electro- and photoproduction of vector mesons is also accounted for very successfully @xcite .",
    "some attempts were recently made to predict the @xmath17 cross section @xcite .",
    "however , several points remain unsatisfactory in this model , both on the theoretical and on the phenomenological side .",
    "first , the form of the dipole cross section is quite _",
    "ad hoc_. then , we note that for the description of small-@xmath2 data , an arbitrary quark mass of order @xmath18 has to be chosen . on the phenomenological side",
    ", the original saturation model fails at describing the @xmath19-slope of @xmath0 at large @xmath2 .",
    "a revisited version has just been released @xcite , which takes care of some collinear resummations .",
    "the new model is much more successful , but it seems to incorporate less saturation effects since the saturation scale @xmath8 is shifted towards a lower value @xcite .",
    "this might indicate that either saturation effects are there but can be mimicked by a dglap evolution , or dglap effects are still predominant . in the latter case",
    "the success of the original dipole model could be attributed to collinear resummations effectively taken into account in the dipole - proton cross section , though this is not at all apparent .",
    "our goal in this paper is to go back to the main known features of saturation and to incorporate them in a simple parametrization for the structure function .",
    "our main result is that an exponentiated elementary dipole - dipole cross section ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : finalehighq2],[eq : finalelowq2 ] ) and figs .  2,3,4 ) fits remarkably well the hera data .",
    "we give some motivation and interpretation for this parametrization in sec .",
    "[ sec : form ] and we present the comparison to the data in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] .",
    "following gbw , we choose the so - called dipole - frame , in which all the qcd evolution is incorporated in the proton .",
    "the photon has just time to fluctuate in a @xmath4 pair which subsequently interacts with a highly evolved proton .",
    "we describe qualitatively the energy evolution of the proton in subsection  ( [ subsec : sat ] ) and the scattering in secs .",
    "( [ subsec : s1 ] ) and  ( [ subsec : s2 ] ) .",
    "the model is summarized on fig.1 .",
    "when the center - of - mass energy increases ( or equivalently when the bjorken variable @xmath1 decreases at fixed @xmath2 ) , more and more quantum fluctuations are revealed in the proton .",
    "indeed , @xmath1 coincides with the fraction of longitudinal momenta ( with respect to the proton momentum ) , of the probed partons .",
    "the lifetime of a partonic fluctuation is proportional to this quantity .",
    "thus going to smaller @xmath1 means probing shorter time intervals , and thus becoming sensitive to more fluctuations .",
    "the rise of the parton densities with @xmath20 is predicted in qcd for a heavy onium @xcite : the density @xmath21 of gluons of longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath1 and transverse momentum @xmath22 is found to obey a linear integro - differential equation , the bfkl equation @xcite .",
    "its solution shows that the gluon density increases like a power of @xmath1 : @xmath23 .",
    "appart from a diffusion term which would appear in a more refined treatment , this rise is independent of @xmath22 .",
    "this model is not correct for very small @xmath1 because the gluons interact with each other and thus each energy level can only accomodate a finite number of them : the density of partons of given transverse momentum should saturate at some point .",
    "this feature has been taken into account by a modification of the bfkl equation .",
    "this modification consists in supplementing it with a nonlinear term : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the linear bfkl kernel .",
    "this is the glr equation @xcite .",
    "several groups have derived saturation equations within qcd ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . among them , kovchegov was able to write a simple equation @xcite which reduces to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sat ] ) when the partons are probed by a dipole of small size .",
    "all available approaches to saturation predict that the transverse momenta of the partons are on average shifted to a scale @xmath8 called the saturation scale such that @xmath26 this was confirmed by a numerical study presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "corrections to formula  ( [ eq : qsat ] ) have been computed recently , see ref.@xcite .",
    "the curve @xmath27 in the @xmath28 plane is called the critical line .",
    "the saturation scale @xmath29 is believed to reach 1 gev around @xmath30 : this is what comes out of the gbw phenomenological approach but a direct experimental evidence was also provided in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is convenient to pair the gluons in colour dipoles of given size @xmath31 ( which is possible in the large @xmath32 limit @xcite ) .",
    "the dipoles are then characterized by a density @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is their average size .",
    "it is also the mean distance between the center of neighbouring dipoles .",
    "we shall assume that the evolved proton is a collection of independent dipoles at the time of the interaction whose sizes are distributed around @xmath34 .",
    "we will approximate the distribution @xmath33 by a delta function of the mean value of the dipole size @xmath35 .",
    "its complete evaluation is presently out of reach .",
    "our confidence in this approximation relies on the observation made in ref.@xcite where it was shown that the data for @xmath36 for any @xmath37 and @xmath2 is function of the combined variable @xmath38 only , to a very good accuracy .    to fix the normalization of @xmath39",
    ", we assume that the total area of these dipoles over the area of the proton is a constant ratio , of order 1 .",
    "this is a kind of boundary condition on the critial line , in the spirit of refs.@xcite and  @xcite and yields the constraint @xmath40 this assumption is supported _ locally _ by the saturation equations of the type  ( [ eq : sat ] ) .",
    "however , it also means implicitly that throughout the evolution , the area of the proton remains of order @xmath41 .",
    "this can only result from non - perturbative confinement effects .",
    "it was indeed shown @xcite that the kovchegov equation , i.e. local saturation alone would lead to violations of unitarity due to the fast expansion of the nucleon radius .",
    "note that the same hypothesis of a proton of fixed transverse size is contained in gbw model .",
    "the dipole distribution in the proton eventually reads @xmath42      in our model where the proton is represented by a density @xmath39 of dipoles , the cross section for dipole - proton scattering reads @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the photon wave function on a @xmath4 dipole state .",
    "@xmath45 is the dipole - dipole cross section computable in perturbative qcd .",
    "we only have to consider its lowest order expression , since all the qcd evolution is put in the dipole density @xmath39 : there is no more room for radiative corrections in @xmath46 .",
    "it reads  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the different factors that appear in this expression have a straightforward interpretation .",
    "this cross - section is the imaginary part of the dipole - dipole elastic amplitude , which requires the exchange of at least two gluons paired in a colour singlet .",
    "these gluons must be able to resolve the smallest dipole , hence their transverse momentum is larger than @xmath50 .",
    "this is colour transparency .",
    "it accounts for the factor @xmath51 .",
    "the correcting logarithm , which becomes sizeable when the dipoles have very different sizes , comes from the monopolar coulomb field , which results in a logarithm in 2 dimensions . indeed , when @xmath52 , the smallest dipole sees the constituents of the largest one as two well - separated colour charges .",
    "in order to have an equal treatment for the photon and the proton and to get the simplest model , we treat the photon as a dipole of size @xmath53 instead of taking account of the complete probability distribution @xmath54 .",
    "this picture is relevant for a longitudinal photon whose wave function is sharply peaked ( around @xmath55 ) .",
    "it is less relevant for transverse photons since their wave function develops a plateau at large @xmath2 @xcite : this is due to the well - known fact that large size dipole configurations ( aligned jet configurations ) are always present in the transversely polarized photon .",
    "we shall however ignore this difficulty .",
    "indeed we believe it is not essential to our discussion since anyhow we donot pretend to be able to describe the very large @xmath2 region . in this spirit , we approximate the distribution @xmath56 by a dirac distribution : @xmath57 @xmath58 is a normalization factor that gives the rate of such a fluctuation @xmath59 .",
    "we take @xmath60 fixed and at the scale 1  gev .",
    "the approximation made here is that we stick to a kinematical region close to @xmath8 where @xmath61 .",
    "injecting eqs.([eq : approxphot ] ) , ( [ eq : approxprot ] ) and ( [ eq : elem ] ) into eq.([eq : section ] ) , we obtain : @xmath62 these formulae deserve an immediate interpretation .",
    "when @xmath63 ( first formula ) , we are in the usual picture of dis where a photon of small size probes the parton ( dipole ) content of the proton .",
    "the flux factor is @xmath58 , the target density is @xmath64 , and the elementary cross section is @xmath65 .",
    "this is the hard pomeron regime : the cross section grows like the exponential of the rapidity , due to the multiplication of dipoles in the proton .",
    "when @xmath66 instead , the dipoles of the proton are smaller than the dipole of the photon .",
    "the use of a perturbative elementary dipole - dipole cross section is justified if @xmath1 is very small so that the scale of the coupling constant @xmath29 is large enough .",
    "how large has always been subject to debate .",
    "we will assume that @xmath67 is fine .",
    "the proton looks like a collection of `` small '' size probes .",
    "the picture is inverted with respect to the previous case : @xmath34 , which is both the mean dipole size and their separation , fixes the resolution .",
    "the flux factor is @xmath64 , the target density is @xmath58 and the elementary dipole - dipole cross section is @xmath68 .",
    "the growth of the parton densities with the energy is compensated by the photon - parton cross section , which falls with the energy .",
    "we are in the soft pomeron regime , in which the @xmath69 cross section grows only like a small power of the energy , @xmath70 .",
    "we note that in this region , the precise relationship between the photon virtuality @xmath2 and the dipole size is not very relevant : corrections to it come as an additional energy - independent @xmath71 term .",
    "an important propery of this parametrization is first that it only depends on @xmath38 and second that the quantity @xmath72 is exactly symmetric under the exchange @xmath73 .",
    "these two features have been observed in the hera data @xcite .",
    "we would now like to refine the model by including multiple gluon exchanges , which as we will argue , are important when @xmath74 . throughout",
    "we will preserve the symmetry just pointed out .",
    "usually multiple gluon exchanges are disfavoured by the smallness of the coupling constant and/or by powers of @xmath75 .",
    "we can see this by computing the probability that a dipole going through the proton undergoes an interaction .",
    "if the dipoles are uniformly spread over the surface of the proton , this probability is @xmath76 as long as it is small enough compared to 1 .",
    "note that @xmath77 coincides with the packing factor @xmath78 usually defined in the context of saturation ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we first observe that parametrically @xmath79 for @xmath60 evaluated at the scale @xmath80 .",
    "then when @xmath81 , @xmath77 is much less than 1 : multiple gluon exchanges are disfavoured by a power of this small factor .",
    "when @xmath82 however , @xmath77 is of order @xmath83 and it is not justified to neglect multiple gluon exchanges .    in a classical framework , these multiple interactions could be accounted for by modifying the interaction probability in the following way .",
    "we note that @xmath84 is the probability of no interaction , where @xmath85 is the @xmath85-matrix element for the dipole - proton interaction for a given impact parameter ( it is constant over the area of the proton within our approximations ) .",
    "the dipole - proton total cross section is then @xmath86 .",
    "multiplying it by the rate @xmath58 of splittings @xmath59 , we obtain for the total photon - proton cross section @xmath87 the exponential is reminiscent of a glauber resummation which would be well justified for example in the case of a nuclear target .",
    "but we must keep in mind that the resummation is theoretically not under control for a proton target and there is up to now no systematic way to do it in qcd .    we choose to keep the exponential form",
    "but we add a free parameter @xmath88 in its argument , so that we recover eq.([eq : sansresom ] ) in the two - gluon exchange limit and the strength of the 4-gluon interaction be fixed by the data .",
    "we will check phenomenologically that the result is not very sensitive to @xmath88 . absorbing all dimensionless normalizations in the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath88",
    ", we obtain the following formula : @xmath89 note that this formula is very close to the original gbw model ( see eq.([eq : gbwmod ] ) ) .",
    "the main difference is the @xmath71 present in the exponential , which will play an important role for the description of the data , as we shall see in the following section .",
    "let us now consider the case @xmath90 .",
    "we wish to preserve the symmetry of @xmath91 for @xmath73 at large @xmath92 .",
    "hence we take the following ansatz for the cross section in this regime : @xmath93 we have kept the same parameters except @xmath88 which is replaced by @xmath94 . indeed",
    ", there is no reason why the resummation should be the same for @xmath63 and for @xmath66 .",
    "let us now try to interpret formula  ( [ eq : finalelowq2 ] ) .",
    "the probability that a specific dipole in the proton has one interaction is @xmath95 . by interpreting the proton as a single effective dipole , with flux @xmath64 and the photon as a set of dipoles with density @xmath58",
    ", we are led to eq.([eq : finalelowq2 ] ) by the same argument of a glauber resummation of multiple gluon pair exchanges .",
    "of course , this is only an _ a posteriori _ interpretation which has to be taken with great care .",
    "indeed , it is usually argued that for @xmath66 , the dipoles in the proton are strongly correlated .",
    "in this section , we compare eq.([eq : finalehighq2 ] ) ( for @xmath63 ) and eq.([eq : finalelowq2 ] ) ( for @xmath66 ) to the recent zeus data for the @xmath0 structure function both in the high @xcite and low @xcite @xmath2 regime , and for @xmath96 .",
    "we assume the parametrization  ( [ eq : qs ] ) for the saturation scale @xmath29 .",
    "we end up with 5 free parameters to be determined by the fit : @xmath15 and @xmath16 parametrize @xmath29 , @xmath58 is the global normalization , and @xmath88 and @xmath94 is the strength of the 4 gluon coupling with respect to the 2 gluon coupling , for @xmath63 and @xmath66 respectively .",
    "the fit is performed with the 177 experimental points which remain after the selection @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath98 is 1.09 per degree of freedom .",
    "it rises to 1.15 when we take all available @xmath2 ( 185 data points ) .",
    "the parameters for @xmath29 are @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the exponent for the rise of the parton densities @xmath16 is consistent with the one found within other approaches .",
    "the saturation scale is 1  gev already for relatively high @xmath1 ( @xmath101 ) , but we can not make a point of this fact since many neglected effects could shift the saturation scale by a constant factor ( for instance the full photon wave function would have such an effect ) .",
    "the exponents @xmath88 and @xmath94 are very loosely determined by the data : we find @xmath102 and @xmath103 , with an error of about @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively",
    ". if we fix them , to 1 for instance , the quality of the fit does not drop much ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the result of the fit is presented on figs .  2 and  3 .",
    "we have added some of the available data points which were not included in the fit and which sit at large @xmath2 and large @xmath1 .",
    "we see a good agreement over the whole @xmath2 , @xmath1 range .",
    "the @xmath1-slope seems to be reproduced fairly well even at large @xmath2 .",
    "however , we slightly overshoot the normalization in this region .",
    "we have also shown , for comparison , the cross section without multiple scatterings , given by eqs.([eq : sansresompert ] ) and  ( [ eq : sansresom ] ) .",
    "we observe that the data is well reproduced for @xmath107 and for @xmath108 , but the resummations are needed around the transition region @xmath109 .",
    "we note that without the resummation of multiple gluon exchanges through the exponentiation , we would obtain a very poor global fit .",
    "however , we have a very good agreement with the data when we fit separately formulae  ( [ eq : sansresompert ] ) and  ( [ eq : sansresom ] ) to the high and low @xmath2 data , but with very different parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the two regions .",
    "we plot the quantity @xmath110 in fig .",
    "the symmetry under the exchange of @xmath111 and @xmath29 is apparent .",
    "our parametrization reproduces it exactly , by construction .",
    "we see that the glauber resummations help to describe the early turnover seen near @xmath112 .",
    "a final remark concerns the comparison with the golec - biernat and wsthoff model .",
    "we have already noted that in the high-@xmath2 domain , the main difference between our formula  ( [ eq : finalehighq2 ] ) and the gbw model is the @xmath71 in the exponent . we have checked that this term is crucial to fit the data . in the gbw model of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is absent from the exponent , but there is an overall @xmath71 factor coming from the photon wave function .",
    "we can summarize our model as follows .",
    "we have assumed that in the dipole frame the energy evolution of the proton leads to the multiplication of the partons and consequently to the appearance of a transverse momentum scale @xmath29 . when @xmath113 , we have the usual dis picture , where the photon probes a set of independent partons .",
    "the rate of the growth of the parton densities has been parametrized by @xmath64 .",
    "this procedure led us to formula  ( [ eq : sansresompert ] ) .",
    "then , we have taken seriously its extrapolation to small values of @xmath2 , and we have observed that the symmetry of the dipole - dipole cross section by exchange of the dipole sizes is exactly seen in the data for @xmath114 total cross section .",
    "when @xmath109 , we have argued that the probability of multiple interactions between the photon and the proton becomes sizeable .",
    "a glauber - like resummation was introduced for @xmath113 and extrapolated by symmetry for @xmath90 .",
    "although very simple and based on very qualitative ideas , the model agrees quantitatively with the recent high precision zeus data .",
    "this model provides an intuitive picture of geometric scaling both in the large @xmath111 ( hard pomeron , perturbative ) and small @xmath2 ( soft pomeron , non - perturbative but weakly coupled ) regimes based on a symmetry between low @xmath2 and high @xmath2 recently observed in the photon - proton cross section .    on the theoretical side",
    ", we may observe that our model could be related to unitary models based on regge theory ( see ref.@xcite ) . in these models , a separation scale of 1  @xmath115 between small and large distance is assumed .",
    "this could correspond to our `` saturation '' radius @xmath116 which is of the same order . in our approach ,",
    "the fan diagrams involving triple pomeron vertices are hidden in the parametrization of the proton evolution ( they are explicitly present in kovchegov s approach for instance ) .",
    "the formula ( [ eq : finalehighq2 ] ) may be seen as an eikonalization of fan diagrams .",
    "on the other hand , in a recent paper @xcite the dipole - proton scattering amplitude was derived in the context of linear bfkl supplemented by absorptive boundary conditions ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the final formula looks very much like eq .",
    "( [ eq : sansresompert ] ) .",
    "it differs only by an anomalous dimension which we donot take into account in our qualitative approach .",
    "the @xmath71 has also presumably a different origin .",
    "however , this gives us confidence that the formula we propose is anyway well rooted in qcd in the restricted perturbative domain @xmath113 .",
