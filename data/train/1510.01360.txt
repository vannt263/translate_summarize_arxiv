    "it is almost 50 years since the shubnikov  de haas ( sdh ) oscillations were observed @xcite in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas . in the next half century , the magnetoresistivity measurements led to remarkable discoveries such as the quantum hall effect and new dirac materials such as graphene .",
    "the diagonal part of the conductivity , @xmath0 , exhibits oscillatory behavior ( sdh effect ) as a function of the carrier concentration and/or magnetic field . a theoretical description of the sdh oscillations is usually provided by the formula @xcite @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the conductivity in the absence of magnetic field @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the cyclotron frequency with @xmath5 being the effective carrier mass and @xmath6 being the electron charge , and @xmath7 is the relaxation time . in the last term in the brackets of eq .",

    "equation  ( [ dos - oscil ] ) is written assuming that the landau levels have a lorentzian shape with a width @xmath22 independent of energy or magnetic field .",
    "the same assumption yields @xmath23 when the electrical conductivity ( [ sigma_xx ] ) is calculated in the bare bubble approximation .",
    "in general , @xmath24 and the real part of the electron self - energy have to be found by solving a self - consistent equation @xcite .",
    "when this is taken into account , the function @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ sigma_xx ] ) acquires a nontrivial form .",
    "nevertheless , the function @xmath25 turns out to be smooth and close to 1 for @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the case of a 2d electron gas with parabolic dispersion , @xmath27 , corresponds to @xmath28 , and the trivial phase , @xmath29 .",
    "the massive dirac fermions with the dispersion , @xmath30 , are characterized by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the fermi velocity and @xmath33 is the gap in the quasiparticle spectrum , @xmath34 with @xmath35 , and the nontrivial phase , @xmath36 . in the latter case , the oscillatory behavior is only possible for @xmath37 .",
    "it is not as widely known that the sdh oscillations can also be observed in the hall resistivity @xcite .",
    "the hall resistivity is not just a monotonic or steplike function of @xmath12 and/or @xmath3 , towards the quantum hall regime , but also contains the _",

    "it is difficult to measure the hall resistivity oscillations not only because at low fields they are experimentally weaker than the diagonal resistivity ones , but also since they must be separated from the large linear background . on the other hand , at high fields the long - period oscillations with a rapidly varying amplitude have to be separated from the monotonic background @xcite .",
    "the _ anomalous hall effect _ ( ahe ) is a phenomenon which consists of the occurrence of the hall effect in solids with broken time - reversal symmetry in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "when this field is applied , the hall resistivity @xmath43 is characterized by an empirical relation @xcite ( see ref .",

    "equation  ( [ hall - anom - empiric ] ) applies to many materials over a broad range of external magnetic fields .",
    "the discovery of dirac materials such as graphene , silicene , etc . and topological insulators has considerably increased the interest in ahe both from theory ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and experiment @xcite .    considering the relationship ( [ hall - anom - empiric ] ) from a perspective of the quantum magnetic oscillations , it is reasonable to question whether these oscillations would emerge in the anomalous hall conductivity . in this article",
    ", we will show that in the dirac materials the oscillations of the anomalous hall conductivity can be as strong as the sdh oscillations of the diagonal conductivity . to observe these oscillations in the existing dirac materials , one should measure either valley or spin hall effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by presenting in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] the model describing massive two - component dirac fermions and exhibiting the anomalous hall effect . in sec .",
    "[ sec : diagonal ] we consider the sdh oscillations of the diagonal conductivity .",
    "it is shown that in addition to the usual term , the diagonal conductivity also contains an anomalous term . the final expression for the sdh oscillations of the anomalous hall conductivity",
    "is presented in sec .",

    "[ sec : observation ] , we suggest the experiments that would allow one to observe the predicted oscillatory behavior . in the conclusion given in sec .  [ sec : conclusion ] , the validity and applicability of the obtained results is discussed in a broader context .",
    "we study the minimal model for ahe with broken time - reversal symmetry represented by the two - component massive dirac fermions in the presence of scalar gaussian disorder .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian density is @xmath48 + \\delta \\tau _ { 3 }   -\\mu \\tau _ { 0},\\]]where the pauli matrices @xmath49 and the unit matrix @xmath50 act in the pseudospin space , @xmath51 with @xmath52 is the momentum operator , and @xmath53 is the dirac mass .",
    "the index @xmath54 distinguishes two inequivalent irreducible @xmath55 representations of the dirac algebra in @xmath56 dimensions that correspond to the two independent valleys in the brillouin zone of the dirac materials .",
    "the external magnetic field @xmath57 is applied perpendicular to the plane along the positive @xmath58 axis .",
    "the main merit of the model ( [ dirac - hamiltonian ] ) is that it not only allows one to obtain simple analytical expressions , but also provides a deep insight into the underlying physics @xcite .",
    "for example , for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the intrinsic ( not induced by disorder ) part of the hall conductivity reads @xcite ( see also ref .   for a review ) @xmath61 in @xmath62 is omitted in what follows because it enters as a product @xmath63 in all final expressions .",
    "yet a theoretical description of the ahe is a challenging problem .",
    "the presence of disorder makes the problem rather complicated even in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "it has been recently shown @xcite that a widely used self - consistent born approximation @xcite fails when one considers how the expression ( [ hall - clean - final ] ) is modified for @xmath37 by disorder .",
    "finishing the discussion of the model ( [ dirac - hamiltonian ] ) , we recall that the ahe may also be interpreted in terms of the motion of electrons in a fictitious magnetic field created by the berry curvature @xcite ( see , also , ref .   for a review ) .",
    "the presence of magnetic field significantly increases the complexity of the problem . to obtain analytical results , we model the smearing of landau levels by lorentzians with a constant width @xmath24 and use the kubo formula with the bare vertex .",
    "we thus ignore the difference between the transport and single - particle lifetimes , which is important for the analysis of the experimental data @xcite unless the scatterers are short range .    to illustrate the range of validity of this approximation , we recapitulate the results for the diagonal conductivity of the dirac fermions , @xmath0 . using the kubo formula , we show in appendix  [ sec : appendix - conductivity ] that the conductivity @xmath0 is the sum of the usual , @xmath64 , and the anomalous , @xmath65 , terms @xmath66 with @xmath67 \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{c } \\mathcal{d}_{\\textrm{n}}(\\epsilon , \\mathcal{b},\\gamma,\\delta ) \\\\ \\mathcal{d}_{\\textrm{ah}}(\\epsilon ,",
