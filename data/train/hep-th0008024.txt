    "invariant functions under the transformations of a compact linear group ( hereafter abbreviated in clg ) @xmath0 , acting in an euclidean space @xmath1 , play an important role in physics , and the determination of their properties is often a basic problem to solve in many physical contexts , such as the determination of patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking , the analysis of phase spaces and structural phase transitions ( landau s theory ) , covariant bifurcation theory , crystal field theory and so on .",
    "a @xmath0-invariant function @xmath13 , @xmath14 , takes on constant values along each orbit of @xmath0 , thus , if one has to analyze its properties , it is certainly more economical , and generally more effective , to think of it as a function defined in the orbit space @xmath7 of the action of @xmath0 in @xmath1 . in this way , it is possible to take fully into account the invariance properties of @xmath13 , while maintaining its regularity properties , but avoiding the troubles that could be met , for instance in the determination of the minima , owing to its degeneracy along the @xmath0-orbits .",
    "this approach to the study of the properties of a @xmath0-invariant function , obviously requires a detailed knowledge of the structure of the orbit space @xmath7 , which can be obtained as follows , using the methods of invariant theory @xcite .",
    "let @xmath15 be a minimal integrity basis ( hereafter abbreviated in mib ) of the ring @xmath16^g$ ] of polynomial invariants of @xmath0 .",
    "the mib defines an _ orbit map _",
    "@xmath17 , mapping @xmath1 onto a semi - algebraic subset , @xmath18 , of @xmath8 , which provides a diffeomorphic image of @xmath7 ( see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if @xmath13 is a @xmath0-invariant polynomial or @xmath19-function it can be written in terms of a polynomial or , respectively , @xmath19-function @xmath20 , in the form @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath20 has the same range as @xmath13 , but its domain is a faithful image of @xmath7 .",
    "the price to pay in the orbit space approach to the analysis of a @xmath0-invariant function is essentially twofold :    1 .",
    "mib s are sometimes difficult to determine .",
    "the domain of the associated function @xmath20 is not the whole euclidean space @xmath8 , but reduces to the semi - algebraic subset @xmath18 @xcite , not trivial to determine .    as for the problem stated under item 2 , the following simple solution has been proposed .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , if the relations among the elements of the mib s are known , the polynomial equalities and inequalities defining @xmath18 and its strata can be determined from the rank and positivity properties of a matrix @xmath10 , defined only in terms of the gradients of the elements of a mib . when there are no relations among the elements of the mib s , that is for compact _ coregular _ linear groups , the matrices @xmath10 play the role of inverse metric matrices , and the isomorphism classes of the orbit spaces of all these groups can be classified in terms of equivalence classes of matrices @xmath10 .",
    "a way to obtain the matrices @xmath10 generated by clg s , bypassing the actually insoluble problem of determining a mib for each group , has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to use an axiomatic approach , that is to forget altogether the original definition of the matrices @xmath10 and to characterize them as far as possible through their structural properties ( _ allowable _ ) .",
    "the possibility of actually computing them is favored by the identification and convenient formalization of a set of sufficiently strong , but handy , analytic conditions , shared by all @xmath10 s .",
    "the less immediately evident of these conditions have been translated into a set of differential equations ( _ boundary conditions _ ) involving the elements of the matrices @xmath10 .    in the case of coregular groups ,",
    "it has been proved that , in the case of less than 5 basic invariants @xcite , the allowable @xmath22-matrices can be determined from the solution of a unique universal differential equation ( that here we shall call _ master equation _ ) , satisfying convenient initial conditions .",
    "the master equation involves as free parameters only the degrees @xmath11 of the basic polynomial invariants .",
    "the conditions defining allowable @xmath22-matrices for _ coregular _ clg s turn out to be so restrictive that , for each choice of a set of degrees @xmath23 , they turn out to select ( at least for @xmath24 ) only a finite number of equivalence classes of matrices @xmath10 .",
    "thus , even if the results obtained along these lines are still strongly incomplete , one may reasonably hope to be able to obtain in the future a classification of the orbit spaces of all compact coregular linear groups , even if the classification of these groups is not yet complete and/or the explicit form of the elements of the corresponding mib s is not known .    in this paper , we shall shortly review the geometry of linear group actions and describe how the invariant theory may successfully be applied to determine the stratification of the orbit space of a compact linear group .",
    "then , we shall turn our attention on the axiomatic approach for the determination of the of clgs .",
    "we shall focus on new developments concerning the generated by groups in the class @xmath25 of non - coregular groups with only one independent relation among the @xmath26 elements of their mib s .",
    "we shall show that the relation among the elements of a mib is determined by one of the irreducible factors of the determinant of @xmath10 , which , along with @xmath10 , has to satisfy the master equation and some additional conditions , part of which can be put in the form of a subsidiary differential equation ( _ second order boundary conditions _ ) .",
    "the effectiveness of these conditions is tested in the simplest case of three basic invariants , by determining all the solutions and selecting those which lead to allowable .",
    "in fact , the conclusion of our analysis is that , leaving aside the trivial cases in which at least one of the invariants @xmath27 is linear ,    * there is only one monoparametric discrete family of allowable non - equivalent  @xmath28 , @xmath29 , whose elements may be generated by groups in @xmath30 .",
    "the degrees of the @xmath31 s are @xmath32 , @xmath33 and , with a convenient choice of the @xmath31 s , the basic relation can be written in the form @xmath34 . *",
    "every allowable  of the family is generated by at least a group @xmath35 .",
    "* if the action of the groups is restricted to the unit sphere @xmath36 of @xmath1 ( which is not essentially restrictive for what concerns the characterization of the orbit space ) , all the orbit spaces @xmath37 , @xmath35 turn out to be isomorphic .",
    "we shall present the matter in the following order . in section 2",
    "we shall recall some known results concerning the characterization of orbit spaces ( see , for instance , @xcite ) in the  approach . in section 3",
    "we recall the derivation of the boundary conditions , of the master relation and of the additional conditions that must be satisfied in the case of coregular clg s .",
    "suitable conditions are subsequently derived for non - coregular groups , with particular attention to the case in which there is only one basic relation : this is the original part of the paper . in ",
    "4 we formalize our approach to the determination of the  that could virtually be associated to actual non - coregular clg s with one independent relation among the basic invariants ; the boundary conditions and the master relation are presented as equations and the notions of proper and allowable solutions of the master equation are defined . in ",
    "5 we compute first all the proper and allowable solutions of the master equation and , after a further selection , we arrive at the determination of the equivalence classes of the  of all the non - coregular clg s of class @xmath38 .",
    "the last part of the section is devoted to the problem of the correspondence between allowable  and generating clg s .",
    "our conclusions agree with a result about locally smooth actions on manifolds with orbits of codimension @xmath39 ( * ? ? ?",
    "iv  8.2 , p.  206 ) .",
    "according to it , if the action of the group is restricted to the unit sphere @xmath40 of @xmath41 , then either @xmath42 is diffeomorphic to the unit interval @xmath43 $ ] , or @xmath42 is diffeomorphic to the @xmath44-sphere @xmath45 .",
    "the former case refers to coregular groups of class @xmath46 , the latter , both to non - coregular groups of class @xmath47 ( whose orbit space is isomorphic to some @xmath48 , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 acts on @xmath51 ) , and to coregular groups of class @xmath52 ( e.g. the linear groups @xmath53 acting in @xmath54 for @xmath55 ) .",
    "the fact that coregular and non - coregular groups may share orbit spaces belonging to the same isomorphism class is an intriguing fact that suggested us to treat the axiomatic approach stressing , whenever possible , analogies and differences between those two cases .",
    "it is worth noting that the effectiveness of our method does not depend on the dimension of the real vector space upon which @xmath0 acts , so it may be applied , in principle , to determine the orbit spaces of all non - coregular groups with only one independent relation among the basic polynomial invariants .",
    "in this section , we shall first define most of our notations and recall , without proofs , some results concerning invariant theory and the geometry of orbit spaces of clg s , then we shall introduce the first definitions and the basic tools for our subsequent analysis . for the unreferenced results",
    "see for instance @xcite .      for our purposes , it will not be restrictive to assume that @xmath0 is a matrix subgroup of @xmath56 acting linearly in the euclidean space @xmath57 .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath58 a point of @xmath59 .",
    "the group @xmath0 acts in @xmath1 in the following way :    @xmath60 the @xmath0-orbit @xmath61 through @xmath62 and the _ isotropy subgroup _ @xmath63 of @xmath0 at @xmath3 are defined by the following relations :    @xmath64    for all @xmath65 , the isotropy subgroup @xmath63 at @xmath66 is a lie group , which is not necessarily connected even if @xmath0 is . if @xmath0 is continuous , the lie algebra @xmath67 of @xmath63 is formed by the elements of the lie algebra @xmath68 of @xmath0 annihilating @xmath66 ; moreover , the @xmath0-orbits are smooth , closed and compact submanifolds of @xmath1 .",
    "they are connected if the group @xmath0 is .",
    "for @xmath0 continuous , a tangent space @xmath69 to an orbit @xmath70 can be defined at all @xmath71 .",
    "it is formed by the tangent vectors at @xmath66 to regular curves through @xmath66 , lying in @xmath70 .",
    "therefore @xmath69 , as a vector space , may be identified with @xmath72 , which is isomorphic to the lie algebra quotient @xmath73 .",
    "the normal space @xmath74 to the orbit @xmath70 through @xmath66 is the orthogonal complement in @xmath1 to @xmath69 .",
    "it may be decomposed into the direct sum @xmath75 , where @xmath76 denotes the orthogonal invariant space to @xmath70 at @xmath66 , formed by all the vectors of @xmath77 which are invariant under @xmath78 .",
    "since it can be prooved that each component space in the decomposition @xmath79 is globally @xmath78-invariant , the representation @xmath80 induced by @xmath0 in @xmath1 turns out to be completely reducible .    if @xmath0 is discrete , such as the finite subgroups of @xmath81 , it may be thought of as a compact lie group with trivial connected component of the unit .",
    "the orbit @xmath61 is a finite set formed by @xmath82 points .",
    "therefore , the tangent space at each point @xmath83 reduces to the null vector of @xmath1 and the normal space is the entire @xmath1 .    in any case",
    ", the invariance of the euclidean norm under orthogonal transformations assures that the g  orbit through @xmath66 is contained in the sphere of radius @xmath66 , centered in the origin of @xmath1 , while the linearity of the action of @xmath0 in @xmath1 implies    @xmath84 the isotropy subgroup of @xmath0 at the origin of @xmath1 coincides with @xmath0 .",
    "the isotropy subgroups of @xmath0 , at points lying on the same orbit @xmath61 are conjugate subgroups in @xmath0 :    @xmath85    the class of all the subgroups of @xmath0 conjugate to @xmath63 in @xmath0 will be said to be the _ orbit type of _ @xmath61 and of its points ; the orbit type specifies the symmetry properties of @xmath61 under transformations induced by elements of @xmath0 .",
    "the points @xmath3 ( or , equivalently , the orbits of @xmath0 ) sharing the same orbit type form an _ isotropy type stratum of the action of @xmath0 in _ @xmath59 , hereafter called simply a _ stratum of _ @xmath1 .",
    "all the connected components of a stratum can be shown to be smooth iso - dimensional sub - manifolds of @xmath1 .",
    "since any sufficiently small displacement from a point @xmath66 in the direction orthogonal to @xmath61 does not change the symmetry properties of @xmath66 iff that direction belongs to @xmath76 , it is possible to prove that the following identity holds fot the tangent space @xmath86 to the stratum in @xmath1 :    @xmath87    the _ orbit space _ of the action of @xmath0 in @xmath88 is defined as the quotient space @xmath89 ( obtained through the equivalence relation between points belonging to the same orbit ) endowed with the quotient topology and differentiable structure .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath90 the canonical projection @xmath91 .",
    "whole orbits of @xmath0 are mapped by @xmath90 into single points of @xmath92 .",
    "any function @xmath93 defined on @xmath7 is differentiable iff @xmath94 is differentiable on @xmath1 .",
    "the image through @xmath90 of a stratum of @xmath57 will be called an ( _ isotropy type _ ) _ stratum of _ @xmath92 ; all its connected components turn out to be smooth iso - dimensional manifolds .",
    "almost all the points of @xmath7 belong to a unique stratum @xmath95 , the _ principal stratum _ , which is a connected open dense subset of @xmath7 .",
    "the boundary @xmath96 of @xmath95 is the union of disjoint _ singular _ strata .",
    "all the strata lying on the boundary @xmath97 of a stratum @xmath98 of @xmath7 are open in @xmath97 .",
    "the following partial ordering can be introduced in the set of all the orbit types : @xmath99<[k]$ ] if @xmath100 is conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath101 .",
    "the orbit type @xmath99 $ ] of a stratum @xmath98 is contained in the orbit types @xmath102 $ ] of all the strata @xmath103 lying in its boundary ; therefore , more peripheral strata of @xmath7 are formed by orbits with higher symmetry under @xmath0 transformations .",
    "the number of distinct orbit types of @xmath0 is finite and there is a unique minimum orbit type , the _ principal orbit type _ , corresponding to the principal stratum ; there is also a unique maximum orbit type @xmath104 $ ] , corresponding to the image through @xmath90 of the set of points of @xmath1 , which are invariant under @xmath0 ; this set contains at least the origin of @xmath1 .",
    "since any orbit @xmath70 is mapped by @xmath90 into a single point of the orbit space , ( [ opli ] ) implies that the tangent space @xmath105 to a stratum @xmath106 of @xmath7 is isomorphic to the normal invariant space @xmath76 , where @xmath66 is any point belonging to the orbit @xmath107 .",
    "this fact has been exploited to construct a faithful image of the orbit space @xmath7 in a euclidean space@xcite . before reviewing this result",
    ", we shall recall a few basics of the geometric approach to invariant theory .",
    "a function @xmath13 is said to be @xmath0-invariant if    @xmath108 the set of all real , @xmath0-invariant , polynomial functions of @xmath66 forms a ring @xmath109^g$ ] , that admits a finite integrity basis @xcite .",
    "therefore , there exists a finite collection of invariant polynomials @xmath110 such that any element @xmath111^g$ ] can be expressed as a polynomial function @xmath112 of @xmath113 :    @xmath114 the polynomial function @xmath115 will be said to have weight @xmath116 , if @xmath116 is the degree of the polynomial @xmath117 and it will be said to be @xmath116-homogeneous if @xmath118 is homogeneous .",
    "we shall denote the homogeneity degree of @xmath119 by @xmath120 .",
    "the elements of a basis of @xmath121^g$ ] can be chosen to be homogeneous polynomials .",
    "the number @xmath26 of elements of a minimal integrity basis and their homogeneity degrees @xmath122 s are only determined by the group @xmath0 .    to avoid trivial situations , in this paper",
    "we shall only consider linear groups with no fixed points , but for the origin of @xmath57 . in this case , the minimum degree of the elements of a minimal integrity basis is necessarily 2 , and the following conventions can be adopted :    @xmath123    hereafter , by a _",
    "minimal integrity basis _",
    "( abbreviated into _ mib _ ) we shall always mean a _ minimal homogeneous integrity basis _ of the ring of @xmath0-invariant polynomials , so chosen that the conventions of ( [ conventions ] ) hold true .",
    "the orbits of a compact group @xmath0 are separated by the elements of any mib of @xmath0 , i.e. , at least one element of a mib takes on different values on two distinct orbits .",
    "but it can be said more .",
    "each mib @xmath124 , defines an orbit map @xmath125 , @xmath126 , which maps all the points of @xmath57 lying on an orbit of @xmath0 into a single point of @xmath127 .",
    "the range @xmath18 of the orbit map @xmath128 yields a faithful image of the orbit space of @xmath0 , and the elements @xmath129 of the mib , thought of as coordinates in the space @xmath8 , provide a smooth parametrization of the points of @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that every orbit map induces a diffeomorphism of @xmath7 onto a semi - algebraic connected closed subset @xmath130 of @xmath8 : @xmath131    the analysis of the structure of @xmath7 is easier if one confines his attention to the orbit space of the action of @xmath0 on the unit sphere @xmath132 of @xmath1 .",
    "this is not restrictive for the following reasons .",
    "owing to the linearity of the action of @xmath0 , the isotropy subgroups of @xmath0 at points lying on the same straight line through the origin of @xmath1 coincide ; thus an essentially complete specification of the structure of @xmath7 is obtained from the structure of @xmath133 .",
    "indeed , there is a bijection @xmath134 mapping the set @xmath135 of strata of @xmath133 onto the set @xmath136 of strata of @xmath137 , such that @xmath138 is homeomorphic to @xmath139 .",
    "moreover , the orbit space @xmath133 is compact and connected .",
    "the same is consequently true for its image under an orbit map @xmath128 : the semi - algebraic set @xmath140 is compact and connected .",
    "a set @xmath141 of @xmath0-invariant polynomials will be said to be _ regular _ if its elements are algebraically , and therefore functionally , independent .",
    "the linear group @xmath0 will be said to be _ coregular _ if its ring of invariant polynomials admits regular integrity bases .    if @xmath142 is a mib of a coregular linear group , the polynomial function @xmath143 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) is uniquely determined and , when it is @xmath116-homogeneous it satisfies the following relation , which is an immediate consequence of euler equation @xmath144 :    @xmath145    let @xmath146 be a complete set of basic homogeneous relations among the elements of a non - regular set @xmath141 of @xmath0-invariant homogeneous polynomials . the polynomials @xmath147 can be chosen to be @xmath116-homogeneous and irreducible on the complex numbers .",
    "the associated equations    @xmath148 define an irreducible algebraic variety in @xmath8 ( and in @xmath149 for @xmath150 ) , which will be called the _",
