    "the solution of approximate dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) has proved to be an effective means for modelling quark propagators in hadronic physics  @xcite .",
    "recent calculations within the genre of models which we shall refer to as the dse technique include those of the light hadron spectrum  @xcite and of electromagnetic form factors of the pion and kaon  @xcite .",
    "although no rigorous proof exists , it is the philosophy of the dse technique that one possible signal of confinement in qcd should be the absence of timelike poles in the quark propagator  @xcite .",
    "it has furthermore been conjectured that the propagator @xmath1 could be an entire function in the complex @xmath2 plane  @xcite",
    ". such a scenario would , for instance , avoid certain unpleasant consequences which can result when modelling mesons via the bethe - salpeter equation which samples the quark propagator over a region of the complex plane .",
    "determining the analytic structure of fermion propagators in qcd  @xcite or other confining theories  @xcite by the direct solution of model dses is not easy .",
    "it appears that the pole or branch cut structure obtained in any particular model is heavily dependent on the approximations employed . in general ,",
    "two aspects of the quark dse must be approximated : the quark - gluon vertex , and the gluon propagator . in this paper",
    ", we shall look at both these aspects within the heavy quark sector . in existing numerical studies in the light quark sector which produce propagators with conjugate singularities  @xcite ,",
    "the quark gluon vertex has usually been approximated by the bare vertex ( the so called rainbow approximation ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , it was shown that an entire function propagator can be obtained if the vertex function is modelled by a more sophisticated form respecting the ward - takahashi identity .",
    "this suggests that it is worthwhile exploring the importance of accurately modelling the quark - gluon vertex , as well as the gluon propagator , when studying the analytic structure of the quark propagator .    in a recent development",
    ", the dse technique has been extended to the realm of heavy quarks  @xcite in a way inspired by heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this exercise was twofold .",
    "firstly , if one acknowledges the success of the dse technique in the light quark sector , it is clear that the dynamics of confined particles is driven by non - perturbative dynamical self dressing . in hqet , non - perturbative self dressing and the detailed analytic structure of the heavy quark propagator are largely ignored .",
    "it is important to know whether this is justified , or whether the successes of hqet are purely fortuitous .",
    "secondly , one has the hope that an accurate determination of the heavy quark propagator will eventually prove useful for building phenomenological models of heavy quark hadrons .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a preliminary attempt is made to calculate the spectrum of heavy quark ",
    "light antiquark mesons by using the combination of rainbow dse and ladder bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) .",
    "it is found that , within the limitations of the model , the pole structure of the heavy quark propagator prevents solution of the meson bse .",
    "this is clearly a shortcoming of the approximations involved . in ref .",
    "@xcite the heavy quark dse is examined from the point of view of the gauge technique .",
    "this is essentially an improvement on the rainbow approximation to the quark - gluon vertex which is designed to respect the ward - takahashi identity .",
    "an alternative approach , and one which we follow in this paper , is to replace the bare vertex ansatz with the ball - chiu vertex ansatz  @xcite .",
    "we shall see that in the heavy fermion limit the gauge technique and the ball - chiu vertex are equivalent .",
    "regarding the gluon propagator , our treatment differs from ref .",
    "@xcite in that it is principally numerical , enabling us to concentrate on a more realistic class of model gluon propagators . specifically we study the simple gaussian ansatz employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , designed to model the infrared enhanced behaviour of the gluon propagator , and a model proposed by frank and roberts ( fr )  @xcite which includes both an enhanced infrared behaviour and the known asymptotic ultraviolet behaviour . in order to deal with the fr propagator , it has been necessary to formulate a properly renormalised version of the heavy quark dse of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in summary ,",
    "our main finding is as follows : improving the vertex ansatz does little to improve the analytic structure of the quark propagator .",
    "however , improving the ansatz employed for the gluon propagator , particularly by including a realistic asymptotic ultraviolet tail , moves poles in the heavy quark propagator to a less intrusive part of the complex momentum plane .",
    "this portends well for future application of the heavy quark dse technique .",

    "there it was demonstrated that the model with bare quark gluon vertex and gaussian feynman - like gauge gluon propagator had no solutions because of poles in the heavy and light quark propagators . ideally , one would like improvements in the dse approximations to move the poles further from the real @xmath88 axis to avoid the region of the @xmath88 plane sampled by a bethe - salpeter calculation .    from table  [ tab ]",
    "we conclude that simply replacing the bare vertex by the ball - chiu vertex in itself does nothing to improve the pole structure of the heavy quark propagator , either for the landau gauge gluon propagator or the feynman - like gluon propagator .",
    "in particular we find that , as the gaussian width @xmath124 increases , a mass pole pole moves in along the imaginary @xmath88 axis .",
    "a pole on the imaginary axis indicates that the fermion can propagate as a free particle , and the position on the positive imaginary axis gives the contribution to the quark mass from the dynamical self dressing . for the bare vertex , the pole splits into conjugate pairs either side of the imaginary axis as @xmath124 decreases . in this instance",
    "the quark becomes a confined particle .",
    "numerical difficulties described above prevented us from confirming that the same situation occurs in the case of the ball - chiu vertex . as @xmath126 we must recover the solution eq .",

    "the position of any propagator mass pole should be independent of the gauge fixing procedure  @xcite . while we certainly do not claim that that our treatment is gauge covariant , it is amusing to note that replacing the bare vertex by the ball - chiu vertex ( and feynman gauge by the computationally convenient feynman - like gauge ) appears to go some way towards satisfying this requirement .",

    "we note a clear movement of the propagator pole further away from the real @xmath55 axis when the asymptotic ultraviolet tail is included in the gluon propagator .",
    "since it is the proximity of the pole to the real axis which prevented a solution to bse in our earlier studies , this suggests that this movement of the pole portends well for future possible studies of heavy quark mesons if careful attention is paid to the asymptotic ultraviolet behaviour of the gluon propagator .    however , a note of caution is in order .",
    "a different choice of renormalisation point would result in the plots in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] shifting by different amounts respectively along the imaginary axis , ensuring that both plots pass through the same point @xmath162 .",
    "consequently , the actual amount by which the pole moves away from the real @xmath55 axis as a result of adding an asymptotic tail to the gluon propagator is an artefact of the choice of renormalisation point , though the movement will always be _ away _ from the real axis .",
    "of course only by carrying though the bse calculation completely can one say for certain whether bound state meson solutions can be obtained .",
    "we have explored the analytic structure of heavy quark propagators following a recently proposed formalism which borrows ideas both from the dse technique and hqet .",
    "it is our belief that , if the successes of hqet are to be properly understood , we must first understand how the non - perturbative dynamics of qcd affect the heavy quark propagator . within the light quark sector",
    "the analytic structure of the quark propagator is perhaps best understood in terms of model dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "it is therefore a worthwhile exercise to extend the dse technique to the heavy quark limit .",
    "the initial attempt in this direction  @xcite failed essentially because the approximations used led to spurious propagator poles which prevented solution of the bound state bethe - salpeter equations .",
    "two approximations were involved : modelling of the quark - gluon vertex and of the the gluon propagator .",
    "we have focused on each of these aspects in turn in this paper . in order to deal with an improved ansatz for the gluon propagator with a realistic asymptotic ultraviolet behaviour",
    ", it has been necessary to formulate a properly renormalised version of the heavy quark dse technique proposed in ref .  @xcite . as an interesting corollary to our formalism",
    "we observe that the freedom to choose the renormalisation point is tantamount to the freedom in zeroth order hqet to choose the heavy quark mass up to a residual mass .",
    "we have first examined the effect of replacing the bare vertex with anstze based on the ball - chiu vertex  @xcite , which is primarily designed to satisfy the ward - takahashi identity .",
    "specifically , we have considered the minimal ball - chiu vertex and two variants : that proposed by curtis and pennington  @xcite and that proposed by haeri  @xcite .",
    "the two variants differ from the minimal vertex by the inclusion of extra transverse components .",
    "we find that , to zeroth order in the inverse of the heavy quark mass , the heavy quark propagator is insensitive to which of the three above anstze is used .",
    "one is led to question to what extent transverse additions to the minimal ball - chiu vertex can be ignored in determining the leading order heavy quark propagator . if they can be be ignored in general there are immediate benefits in using the heavy fermion limit as a test - case for studies of confining field theories .    in our numerical calculations we began with the landau gauge form of the model gaussian gluon propagator @xmath163 , eq .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) , which was employed ( together with the bare vertex ) in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we find no improvement in the propagator pole structure in going from the bare vertex to the ball - chiu vertex while maintaining a gaussian gluon propagator .",
    "that is to say , timelike mass poles indicating non - confinement , or conjugate poles which are likely to interfere with the successful solution to bound state problems , are not removed simply by improving the quark gluon vertex ansatz alone .",
    "however , in the limit in which the width of the gaussian gluon propagator is taken to zero ( the ` infrared dominant model ' ) , we do obtain an entire function heavy quark propagator , free from singularities except an essential singularity at infinity .",
    "this is consistent with the equivalent finite quark mass calculation  @xcite , and may provide a useful propagator for phenomenological modelling purposes .",
    "we conclude then that it is most likely the remaining approximation , namely the gaussian model gluon propagator , which is responsible for the poor analytic structure previously obtained for the quark propagator . to explore this possibility",
    ", we have replaced the simple gaussian gluon propagator ansatz of ref .",
    "@xcite by a gaussian smeared version of the more sophisticated frank and roberts ansatz @xmath164 given by eq .",
    "( [ frprop ] ) . in this case ,",
    "convergence of the integral in the dse which is lost by naively retaining only the lowest order of the @xmath57 expansion of the quark propagator must be restored by judiciously including at least the spatially dependent @xmath165 part : @xmath166 the renormalised current quark mass @xmath99 then becomes an ultraviolet regulator , and in the case of the fr propagator the lowest order contribution to the mass expansion of the heavy quark self energy behaves as @xmath167 , where @xmath168 delineates the scale at which the asymptotic ultraviolet behaviour of the fr propagator sets in .",
    "our numerical solutions of the heavy quark dse show a clear movement of the offensive propagator poles away from that part of the complex momentum plane likely to be sampled by a bethe - salpeter calculation of heavy quark meson states .",
    "however we caution that the amount by which the poles shift is , strictly speaking , dependent on the choice of renormalisation point . without carrying through the the bethe - salpeter analysis one can not say for sure that the problem is solved .",
    "a further study of the bse for heavy mesons is expected to be the focus of future work .",
    "our work has also thrown up a couple of other interesting questions worthy of attention .",
    "firstly , it should be possible to check directly to what extent the propagator pole structure is invariant with respect to the choice of gauge fixing parameter @xmath33 . as the postions of propagator poles should be gauge independent  @xcite , this provides a straightforward measure of the ability of a particular vertex ansatz to respect gauge covariance of the model .",
    "secondly , one is led to question the meaning of propagator poles obtained from a euclidean dse formalism . whether propagator poles obtained in this way are an artefact of the approximations used or whether they are a genuine property of quark propagators has been an open question for some time  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the heavy fermion limit may help to shed some light on this problem by developing a bethe - salpeter formalism for heavy quarkonium states .",
    "it is well known that the non - relativistic limit of the bethe - salpeter equation for a heavy fermion ",
    "heavy antifermion bound state can be written in the form of a schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "the derivation typically assumes physical mass poles in the fermion propagators whose residues contribute to the resulting schrdinger equation .",
    "an analogous derivation for the case of propagator poles which have moved off the timelike momentum axis as a result of a confining gluon propagator may help both with interpretation of quark propagator poles and with understanding the success of heavy quark potential models .",
    "the author is grateful to c.  d.  roberts and p.  maris for helpful discussions .",
