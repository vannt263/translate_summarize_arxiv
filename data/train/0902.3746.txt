    "we found , in literature , many evidences of a lot of unsolved problems , which are still open questions in the picture of einstein field equations .",
    "one of the most important issue of general relativity ( gr ) is a complete comprehension and interpretation of the cosmological constant in accordance with data . in the framework of friedmann equations we write equations of motion of @xmath4 , and of pressure @xmath9 , in terms of scale parameter @xmath5 ; on the other hand we do not consider any kind of mass dynamics , induced as an emergent effect of a statical mass distribution too ; this could mean that we lose information about matter dynamics and distribution , in sense that we consider it as the static part of a dynamic equation , where the scale factor @xmath5 is the true dynamical element . in order to consider a more direct matter dynamics we focus on @xmath4 of universe and we supposed the validity of the scale - free model @xcite into the framework of gr ; i.e. to say that could exist a statistical model which describes the motion of matter and defines implicitly , in this way , the true dynamics of the scale factor .",
    "this interpretation will allow us to describe a dynamics of universe , starting only from the basic assumptions that every part of universe ( in the framework of homogeneity and of isotropy ) is characterized by a distribution of gravitons , induced by the simple presence of mass .",
    "every graviton is linked to each other by a network or by a family of networks and its existence is provided by the implicit presence of nodes , characterized by a space - time vector @xmath10 , in which is possible to have a graviton .",
    "this model appears to be useful for matter distribution of universe , making us able , also , to consider the universe like a disordered system .    in particular , it is possible to describe the existence of heterogeneous spectrum of local interaction patterns topologically linked to the presence of nodes . following the features done by other authors @xcite",
    ", we try to investigate the consequences of degree heterogeneity on dynamic properties of networks isolating a region of universe of correlated networks with a completely random organization , defined by the distribution @xmath6 , where @xmath11 has to be considered as an integer number .",
    "this ansatz shows apparently that dynamics would be limited to a particular region but it is generalized , simply , assuming , as in the beginning , a homogeneous and isotropic universe , which allows us to extend a particular result to the whole system ( the universe evolution ) .",
    "moreover the possibility to consider an elevate number of networks , @xmath12 , is the basic idea to consider firstly , because , although @xmath13 , it is true , at the same time , that @xmath12 is a very large number .    in order to describe dynamics , we need all the quantities @xcite describing it .",
    "these are the cosmographic parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite ; respectively the hubble parameter , the deceleration parameter , the jerk parameter and finally the snap parameter ; these are defined in principle for all @xmath14 , or redshifts @xmath15 . assuming the power law degree distribution of the form @xmath6 , which is the basic idea of the model , and supposing no interactions among networks , that is equivalent to say that the type of interaction described by us , i.e. mean - field type , we are also able to infer how the scale - free model also deals with transitions and , so , it could be also fruitful to explain , for a fixed number of gravitons into account , for what values of the involved quantities the transition era could start , that could be a real topic to test the statistical model proposed @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to characterize the model considering the value of parameter @xmath11 , which is the most influent parameter of the model .",
    "for example some evidences describe a probability distribution with @xmath7 , which for real systems appears to be a correct choice @xcite .",
    "of course , indeed , depending to the value of @xmath11 , we find many different behaviors ; in the present paper we do not matter initially about the exact value of @xmath11 in order to describe a particular behavior .    for our purposes , following the description of @xcite , the first quantity introduced to describe the matter distribution is @xmath16 , which represents the average density of particles in nodes of degree @xmath17 and for all the variables ,",
    "it holds @xmath18,\\ ] ] which is a first example of langevin equation for our model ; it suggests that the first two terms on the right side of equation are due to diffusion in uncorrelated random graphs and the third could be considered as a reaction kernel that depends only on @xmath19 . from this equation",
    "we derive the dynamics of a particular choice of @xmath17 . in order to show the evolution of density @xmath20 , the density which is present in friedmann equations",
    ", we must require that @xmath21 in the continous limit , the above sum becomes an integrals over the @xmath17 space , which has to be troncated by using @xmath22 .",
    "easily , following @xcite @xmath23    we consider that near a critical point @xmath24 , density is small , thus we expect that the mean - field regime holds when @xmath25 and @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding langevin equation is @xmath26 where we considered @xmath27 three integration constants and , in particular @xmath28 if we assume universe as a whole system we must require the possible presence of noise term ; we describe an universe without noise if @xmath29 with the @xmath30 parameter which has to be in relation with @xmath11 because , if eq .",
    "( @xmath31 ) holds , we must require @xmath32 or equivalently at least @xmath33 ; because @xcite @xmath30 appears to be the maximum degree of the network size @xmath12 , it must satisfy @xmath34 and so our interval is always in agreement with this request .",
    "the basic idea becomes , so , to start with the scale - free probability , concerning a discrete interactions among gravitons and so , after defining the density time evolution ( eq .",
    "( @xmath35 ) ) , considering the cosmographic evolution of parameters of the universe .",
    "all the considerations we will do , have to respect eqs .",
    "( @xmath31 ) and ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "it will be possible to link the universe description also to critical parameter , as said before , in order to describe the transition era , and it will be clear in the next sections .",
    "the article is divided as follows : in the next section we describe , briefly , all the results involved by the use of gr in the framework of scale - free model for generic redshift @xmath15 ; in particular , we derive the functional form of the dynamical parameter @xmath5 , first , which will be the basis for the construction of the cosmographic parameters , later ; their own expressions will be found very easily for generic redshifts without approximation in this section . in the third section",
    "we compare the results , obtained in the previous one , in the observable limit @xmath37 with comparison with wmap data , trying to link also the expressions found with the definition of @xmath38 , which represents the density of cosmological constant @xmath8 , i.e. _ dark energy _ , and we try to infer the role of @xmath8 , just in the statistical way considered .",
    "the last section is devoted to some qualitative considerations , conclusion and perspectives for future works on this direction .",
    "in this section we infer from scale - free model a specific dynamics for universe , without a particular limit on @xmath15 , or of time @xmath14 , of the dynamical quantities involved .",
    "such a dynamics , defined from the statistical background is easily valuable , thanks to the first friedmann equation , which is an expression that makes a correspondence between @xmath0 and @xmath4 as follows @xmath39 where we have considered , in principle , to take @xmath40 in the above expression ; and using the positions @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we can imagine to evaluate @xmath4 and its derivative @xmath43 by putting them into eq .",
    "( @xmath35 ) , having , so , a differential equation for @xmath0 , in the case @xmath44 , which translates the matter statistical distribution into an astrophysical differential equation for @xmath0 , which reads @xmath45 it could give us the correspondent evolution of universe dynamics in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath5 ; in fact , the solution for @xmath0 is writable , in terms of @xmath5 , because of definition @xmath46 .",
    "all the discussion is completely global , in sense that , at this stage , we are not considering any kind of approximation on @xmath14 , or on @xmath15 , as already mentioned before ; that is the same to say that a complete comprehension of dynamics is , in this paragraph , involved .    for the sake of simplicity we rewrite",
    "( @xmath47 ) at @xmath48 , making the following positions @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 and so we get the simple solution for @xmath0 @xmath52 where @xmath53 . in the previous expression we consider the position @xmath54 too",
    "and we notice that the integration constant could be considered as an arbitrary time @xmath55 . depending from @xmath56 sign",
    "we could have different evolutions of @xmath0 ; this sign , indeed , can not be less than zero : a similar choice , i.e. @xmath57 , shows us a definite time interval in which @xmath0 ( and so @xmath5 ) loses its meaning .",
    "hence , for describing a variable @xmath5 , for all the time , we must have @xmath58 .",
    "on the other hand , this is evident , in order to have a solution , which has no periodicity , into account .",
    "this could , also , be tested , by considering directly its expression , @xmath59 and it gets @xmath60 which is always positive for all the possible values assumed by @xmath9 and @xmath61 , if we require that @xmath62 .",
    "our choice is the simplest one : because of @xmath63 are  phenomenological  quantities , defining the type of reaction and process , we could assume , without losing information , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . indeed , it is possible in principle , that @xmath66 and @xmath67 , but we will deny this , comparing also with wmap data .",
    "our efforts , on the other side , describe a model , whose validity is strongly dependent from @xmath63 values , which has to be chosen by data . + from integrating eq .",
    "( @xmath47 ) , it is possible to get , also , a precise value for @xmath68 . the theoretical expression , that we find , is @xmath69 which is the solution of equation @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , together with @xmath72 condition , which is obvious , if we consider the positive direction of time .",
    "( @xmath73 ) gives two positive solutions , i.e. @xmath74 @xmath75 both solutions are , in the thermodynamic limit , equivalent and they would read @xmath76 ; in our case , for @xmath13 , only eq .",
    "( @xmath77 ) is relevant , if happens that @xmath78 .",
    "this condition will represent the correct interval for @xmath9 and @xmath61 choice .    moreover , eq . ( @xmath77 )",
    "is also useful because tells us the value of @xmath55 in the expression ( @xmath79 ) ; it reads @xmath80 after evaluating the @xmath0 dynamics we naturally achieve to find the expression for scale factor @xmath5 .",
    "we get @xmath81 where the function @xmath82 is expressed by @xmath83 @xmath84 with the integration constant @xmath85 of the form @xmath86     with @xmath40 .",

    "the other expressions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which discriminates the type of universe dynamics , are described in appendix for their complexity .",
    "recently the possibility to get , from data , all the elements for universe dynamics , has been reported by several works ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "a form of so - called cosmography , which corresponds to the possibility to infer , by some useful parameters , the universe evolution , is involved . we know , in fact",
    ", that we are living in the so - called period of _ precision cosmology _ , in which observations are extremely precise and allows us to test better than past , a given evolutionary models .",
    "the expressions we need are the so - called deceleration @xmath1 , jerk @xmath2 , snap @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the cosmographic parameters are defined by derivatives of the scale factor for our epoch ; they , instead of their simplicity , allow to fit the data also in terms of redshift , that is an implicit measure of time .",
    "it is remarkable to remember that the model , we are going to consider , here and in the following , is the standard model @xcite which is not useful when @xmath15 is not little , i.e. @xmath37 , that is , indeed , the case of validity of the taylor expansion of scale parameter .",
    "+ in fact , for our time , the cosmographic parameters are defined by the expression @xmath93 and so they reads @xmath94",
    "@xmath95    @xmath96    @xmath97    we denote with a subscript @xmath98 these parameters , in sense that they are evaluated at @xmath99 ; on the meaning of these parameters see for example @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will take into account wmap observations and so we will assume that the value of the hubble constant is @xmath100 km / sec / mpc at our time @xmath101 @xcite .    following these advice , it is clear that , the cosmographic parameters may also be tested by wmap data @xcite and , above all , for the observed limit @xmath37 .",
    "it is also possible to express them , in terms of the dark energy density @xmath38 , which could stress also the role of a cosmological constant involved into einstein field equations , and so , give a description of @xmath8cdm model in terms of statistical background .    in order to understand such description",
    ", we can follow the prescription of @xcite .",
    "hence , we will use the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parameterization for the equation of state setting @xcite , which reads @xmath102 , with @xmath103 .",
    "easily , noting the correspondence @xmath104 , i.e. @xmath105 .",

    "+ it is necessary to note that all the expressions obtained are in the case @xmath40 , which is the observed one @xcite .",
    "inducing a curvature term @xmath122 is possible to achieve an expression for @xmath5 , which is not analytically defined .",
    "it appears as a strong complication of the model ; indeed , it seems so also because observation provide a curvature density @xmath123 , but we could easily consider a graphic of it , in order to fix ideas .     with @xmath124 .",

    "now we can write down all the parameters in terms of @xmath126 , as follows @xmath127 and eqs .",

    "we investigated in this paper that the scale - free model , achieving a statistical interpretation of the  background  of space time , by the presence of a large number of gravitons , allowed us , thanks to networks interactions , to define directly @xmath4 dynamics , without using , the scale factor @xmath5 dynamics , in the picture of mean field approximation .",
    "moreover we showed , that , if that dynamics is involved into the framework of gr , we are able to define all the cosmographic parameters , in terms of time evolution and , in principle , also of redshift @xmath15 .",
    "best results were @xmath134 which represents the acceleration parameter of universe and tells us the universe expansion and also the cosmological constant @xmath8 , which became dependent from statistical and cosmological parameters .",
    "this could be thought as an explanation of the peculiar reason for what a cosmological constant has to be put into einstein field equations , in order to respect the correct statistical matter distribution and matter evolution .",
    "we have , also , discussed the possibility to evaluate the parameters of scale - free theory at our epoch in terms of measured cosmographic parameters and vice - versa .",
    "starting from these results , we can discuss , indeed , also the possibility of defining a dark matter dynamical equations thanks to the expression of density motion , defined in the introduction and , of course , we can also focus a possible reformulation of @xmath8 in the framework of a microscopic theory , involved by the scale - free model directly .",
    "the choice of @xmath6 appears to be comparable with the density of a high - energy astrophysical object and could suggest that scale - free model could be a possible adaptable statistical model for the cases of fermi processes @xcite .",
    "the scale - free model appears to be a framework model for gravitation so , in principle , extensions of gr are adaptable with scale - free model .",
    "moreover , all the previous results , concerning finite networks , could be extended in the case of infinite networks by using diverging cut - off @xmath135 .",
    "it is possible to show , that depending from @xmath136 and @xmath61 values , different results are involved , and this will concern to future efforts .",
    "other fields of future interest are to be found in the possibility to join the statistical behavior , described in this work , not necessary in the case of gr @xcite",
    ". it will be clear in future work , that modifications occur if a different field theory is involved ; idea which is possible , because the model appears to be independent from the field background .",
    "concluding , of course , the statistics in this sense is a first kind of example in which the possibility to consider a different approach to the problem of @xmath8 . this is possible , also passing through a quantum picture as showed , for example , in @xcite .",
