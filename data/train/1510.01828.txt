    "in equilibrium statistical mechanics , the notion of an ordered state is well understood and the degree of order is characterized with the aid of two - point and one - point functions .",
    "thus , the long - range order ( lro ) @xmath10 is defined through the asymptotic behaviour of a two - point correlation function , while the order parameter @xmath11 , the spontaneous value in a vanishing field , is a one - point function . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "fluctuations become insignificant and @xmath11 and @xmath12 have well defined values @xcite . further , for systems with short - ranged interactions , conditions under which ordering is possible are known .",
    "ordering occurs only if the spatial dimension exceeds one for a scalar order parameter , or exceeds two if ordering breaks a continuous symmetry @xcite .    in nonequilibrium steady states ,",
    "other types of behaviour are possible and characterization of order needs to be addressed afresh .",
    "of particular interest is a class of systems in which fluctuations are anomalously strong , but which nevertheless have a propensity to order , leading to fluctuation - dominated phase ordering ( fdpo)@xcite .",
    "fdpo arises in several types of systems .",
    "these include passive scalar systems , in which a passive species is driven by an autonomously evolving field , e.g. , particles driven by a fluctuating surface or a noisy burgers fluid in one and two dimensions @xcite , or , in the context of active systems , by a 2d nematic field @xcite .",
    "fdpo also arises in a model 1d granular gas in which the coefficient of restitution depends on the velocity of approach @xcite .",
    "the signature of fdpo is a cusp singularity at small argument in the scaled two - point correlation function , signifying a breakdown of the porod law .",
    "the relation of this singularity to giant number fluctuations has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of active systems .",
    "stronger singularities of the scaling function arise if the passive particles do not have hard core interactions @xcite .",
    "finally , there seems to be an intriguing connection between fdpo and systems with quenched disorder , and cusp singularities have been observed in a number of systems with rough surfaces and interfaces  @xcite .",
    "this paper deals with the characterization of order in a passive scalar system which exhibits fdpo .",
    "the system consists of hard - core particles sliding locally downwards , along the local slopes of a one - dimensional fluctuating surface with overall slope zero  @xcite .",
    "the surface evolves through its own dynamics whereas the particle movement is guided by local surface gradients .",
    "as time passes , particles are driven towards each other and the spatial extent of particle - rich regions increases as a function of time , until it is of the order of system size in steady state .    in earlier work ,",
    "this tendency was quantified by studying coarsening properties , as the system evolves in time starting from a completely disordered state . as usual for coarsening systems",
    ", the equal time correlation function @xmath13 obeys scaling , with a growing length scale @xmath14 .",
    "the unusual point here is that the scaling function shows a cusp singularity as the argument @xmath15 approaches zero . in momentum space",
    ", this translates into the scaled structure factor varying as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the wave vector .",
    "the exponent @xmath18 is less than 1 signifying a cusp singularity , which represents a marked deviation from the linear behaviour characteristic of the porod law ( @xmath19 ) which holds normally for scalar field coarsening @xcite .",
    "further , cusp singularities were also observed in the correlation function in steady state @xcite , and also in the decay of the temporal auto - correlation function  @xcite .    in this paper , our focus is on the study of both static and dynamic aspects of the order parameter or one point function @xmath20 .",
    "we argue that a single scalar order parameter does not suffice to properly characterize the order and we need to monitor a larger set .",
    "this set is built from the long - wavelength fourier components of the density profile .",
    "we present evidence that these fourier components have probability distributions which remain broad in the thermodynamic limit ; that they are anticorrelated with each other ; and that the probability distributions of the components for different sizes are described by simple scaling laws .",
    "we supplement our studies of the sliding particle system by studying a related coarse - grained depth model , and show that this model exhibits broadly similar behaviour .",
    "further , the temporal behaviours ( of autocorrelation and cross - correlation of the fourier modes ) are studied and scaling properties are investigated .",
    "this includes a study of dynamical structure function and the flatness , which is found to exhibit a divergence at small argument , indicating that the behaviour in time is intermittent  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the sliding particle ( sp ) and coarse - grained depth ( cd ) models of fluctuating surfaces and review the behaviour of the two - point correlation function . in sec .  [",
    "sec : statics ] , we discuss the static properties of one point function , arguing that long - wavelength fourier transforms of the density profile constitute an appropriate set of order parameters .",
    "we discuss their probability distributions , the correlations between them , and scaling properties . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] , we discuss the corresponding dynamical properties including cross correlations between modes .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss some simple models that show fdpo . the sliding particle ( sp ) model involves a system of hard core particles sliding under gravity on a stochastically evolving surface @xcite through either edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) or kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) dynamics @xcite .",
    "we also define the coarse grained depth ( cd ) model which only involves the height field of the fluctuating surface , and which provides considerable insight .",
    "we then summarize the results of @xcite on the scaling behaviour of two - point correlation functions in these models .",
    "this is a lattice model of particles moving on a 1d fluctuating surface  @xcite .",
    "the particles and links are represented respectively by @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "both @xmath23 s and @xmath24 s are ising like variables that can take values @xmath25 on a one dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions . the occupation of any site @xmath26 can be given in terms of @xmath27 s , as @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , and the local slope of the surface connecting site @xmath26 is given by the variable @xmath30 or @xmath31 and is denoted by / or @xmath32 respectively .",
    "the evolution of the surface can be modelled by either the ew or the kpz dynamics .",
    "this is incorporated in our model by the stochastic corner flips involving exchange of adjacent @xmath24 s : thus @xmath33 occurs with rate @xmath34 , while @xmath35 changes with rate @xmath36 .",
    "the symmetric surface fluctuations , i.e. @xmath37 , belong to the ew class whereas @xmath38 belongs to the kpz class .",
    "the dynamics of the particles can be modelled by exchanging the position of a particle and a vacancy ( hole ) pair at adjacent sites @xmath39 with rates that depend on the intermediate local slope : thus the moves @xmath40 and @xmath41 occur at a rate @xmath42 , while the reverse moves occur at a rate @xmath43 .",
    "this asymmetry reflects the fact that it is easier to move downwards under the influence of a gravitational field . in our study",
    "we consider the strong field limit i.e. , @xmath44 for the particle system and set @xmath45 .",
    "the dynamics conserves both @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and we study that sector where @xmath48 and @xmath49 vanish corresponding to the half - filled system of particles on a surface with zero average tilt .          in order to describe the dynamics of the hills and valleys of the surface ,",
    "let us consider the height profile @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "we wish to define a model involving only @xmath52 , to mimic the sp model .",
    "since sp particles slide down and occupy the lower portion of the height profile , we define an analogous variable @xmath27 in the cd model as taking on the values @xmath53 , @xmath31 , or @xmath54 depending on whether the surface profile at site @xmath26 is below , above , or exactly coincident with a reference level : @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the instantaneous average height which fluctuates with time .",
    "the nomenclature coarse - grained depth model derives from the fact that the mapping @xmath57 may be viewed as a coarse graining which eliminates all fluctuations of the height other than the sign .",
    "the cd model is concerned with the static and dynamic properties of @xmath21 , which mimics the particle configuration in the sp model .",
    "the two - point correlation function characterizes the steady state approached by the system of particles driven by a fluctuating surface that exhibits lro .",
    "we monitor the evolution of the local density using monte carlo simulations .",
    "for both the ew and kpz surfaces , no equilibration is needed because every configuration of hills and valleys with periodic boundary condition carries equal weight and can be chosen at random as a valid surface configuration in the steady state .",
    "the particles are distributed randomly on sites . in every monte carlo step",
    ", we performed @xmath58 updates ( @xmath6 each for sites and bond variables ) at random .",
    "the density distribution is guided by the evolution of the surface profile .    to quantify the tendency towards clustering",
    ", one can define the equal time two point correlation function as @xmath59 for the sp model , and @xmath60 for the cd model .",
    "the correlation functions have the scaling form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a time - dependent length scale which describes the typical linear size of a cluster at time @xmath63 , typically growing as a power law in time i.e. @xmath64 . here",
    ", @xmath7 is the dynamical exponent characteristic of the surface fluctuations .",
    "this length scale @xmath62 for density fluctuations is set by the base lengths of typical coarse - grained hills which have overturned in time @xmath63 .    in 1d",
    ", we have @xmath8 for ew and @xmath9 for kpz surface evolution .",
    "the existence of such a single growing length scale is a signature of coarsening towards a phase - ordered state .",
    "the coarsening is driven by surface fluctuations , rather than temperature quenching . as previously studied in refs .",
    "@xcite the scaling curves have cusps at small values of @xmath65 with a nonzero intercept .",
    "that is , @xmath66 .",
    "the intercept @xmath67 is equal to the lro measure @xmath68 .",
    "this is because an arbitrary large but fixed distance @xmath69 corresponds to @xmath70 in a coarsening system , since @xmath71 diverges as @xmath72 .",
    "the cusp exponent @xmath18 is found numerically to be @xmath73 for ew evolution and @xmath74 with kpz dynamics of the interface  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the cusp exponent @xmath75 can be found analytically for the cd model .",
    "the cusp implies a tail of scaled structure factor @xmath76 for large @xmath77 .",
    "this shows a deviation from the porod law @xmath78 , characteristic of customary coarsening .",
    "if instead of considering coarsening in an infinite system , we consider steady state in a finite system of size @xmath6 , we may replace @xmath79 by @xmath6 to conclude that the scaled two - point correlation function in the steady state can be written as @xmath80 with @xmath81 . here , as with coarsening , the cusp exponent @xmath82 for ew and @xmath83 for kpz surface evolution .",
    "the long - wavelength fourier transforms of the density profile ( in the sp model ) or the coarse - grained depth ( in the cd model ) constitute a set of order parameters appropriate to characterize the type of large - scale clustering that sets in . in this section ,",
    "we study the probability distributions of these parameters and their scaling properties as the system size is changed .",
    "let us define fourier components of the density @xmath84 where , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "as we will see below , the lowest nonzero fourier components @xmath87 can be used as a measure of the phase separation in our system with conserved dynamics .",
    "figure [ fig : qkkcd ] shows the mean values @xmath88 as a function of @xmath17 for various values of @xmath6 for sp and cd models .",
    "two points should be noted .",

    "( b ) in order to study the @xmath91 limit , it is instructive to observe the behaviour of the low-@xmath92 modes @xmath93 with @xmath94 and monitor @xmath95 .",

    "[ fig : qkkcd ] that @xmath96 , @xmath97 , etc .",
    ", each approach a finite limit as @xmath98 .",
    "the values of first four fourier modes for various models are tabulated in table  [ tab:1 ] for both the ew and kpz surface evolutions . from the table , we observe that @xmath99 is the largest , and it thus provides a first characterization of order .    .",

    "the mean values of the fourier components @xmath102 decrease with increasing @xmath92 , providing strong evidence that macroscopic clustering occurs in the system .",
    "figure  [ fig : qtime ] shows the time series for the long - wavelength fourier modes @xmath0 .",
    "the strong excursions about their average values lead to broad probability distributions .",
    "in fact these distributions remain broad in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is contrary to the situation in normal equilibrium phase transitions where the order parameter has a well defined value in the thermodynamic limit and its distribution consists of delta functions at values that characterize the phase .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : probability ] , we have shown the probability distribution functions of the first eight modes @xmath103 for both the sp and cd models with ew and kpz surface evolutions . these distributions are obtained numerically for system sizes @xmath104 , 128 , and 192 for ew , and @xmath105 , 256 , and 512 for kpz surface evolutions . it is evident from the figure that the distributions for various modes are spread over a wide range of values .",
    "furthermore , these distributions approach a limiting form on increasing the system size ; they remain broad even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the probability distributions of the fourier modes for the sp and cd models are broadly similar except for the first mode @xmath106 .",
    "for the cd model , the distribution @xmath107 increases monotonically with @xmath106 , while , for the sp model , it first increases and then decreases .",
