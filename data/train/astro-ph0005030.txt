    "[ se29:intro ]    the general picture of low mass star formation has been formed since the 1980 s with the availability of infrared and millimeter wavelength broad band photometry from the ground , and with the iras satellite and kao observatory ( e.g. , lada & wilking @xcite ; adams et al .",

    "@xcite ; andr et al .",
    "a classification scheme was made , where the continuum emission of class  0 and  i objects peaks in the submillimeter and far - infrared .",
    "these objects are still deeply embedded in their accreting envelopes . in the class",
    "ii phase , the wind of the protostar has cleared its surrounding environment , such that it becomes optically visible , and shows emission lines . the continuum emission of these objects peaks in the near - infrared , but there is still significant excess emission above the stellar continuum .",
    "they are believed to be surrounded by optically thick dusty disks .",
    "finally , little dust emission remains for class  iii objects , when the disk is optically thin , and planetary companions may have been formed .",
    "our knowledge of the physical and chemical state and evolution of the material surrounding protostars , has progressed with the availability of medium and high resolution spectroscopic instrumentation at near and mid - infrared wavelengths ( @xmath6  @xmath0 ) .",
    "the progress made , is best illustrated by the observations of high mass protostars , which are bright and easy to observe .",
    "the ( ro-)vibrational bands of various molecules ( co , @xmath3 , @xmath7 , silicates ) were observed from the ground , revealing profile variations of the 3.07  @xmath0 , and 4.67  @xmath0 @xmath3 and co ice bands ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "@xcite ; tielens et al .",

    "this was interpreted as evaporation of the volatile co ice , and crystallization of @xmath3 ice in the molecular envelopes .",
    "this heating effect is strengthened by the detection of hot gas in 4.6  @xmath0 co observations ( mitchell et al .",
    "@xcite ) . with the launch of the _ infrared space observatory _ in 1995 ( iso ; kessler et al .",
    "@xcite ) , it became possible to observe all other molecular bands in the infrared ( whittet et al .",
    "it was shown that high mass protostellar evolution can be traced in the gas - to - solid abundance ratios ( van dishoeck et al . @xcite ; van dishoeck & blake @xcite ) , and the profiles of the ice bands , in particular solid @xmath4 ( gerakines et al .",
    "@xcite ; boogert et al .",
    "thus , there is overwhelming evidence that thermal processing , i.e. evaporation and crystallization of ices in and around hot molecular cores , plays an important role in the evolution of high mass molecular envelopes .",
    "the composition and evolution of the molecular material around low mass protostars are not as well studied .",
    "it seems unlikely that the molecular material evolves similar to that around high mass protostars .",
    "low mass protostars evolve much slower , release less radiative energy , drive less energetic winds , and form disks .",
    "it is not established whether low mass objects possess hot cores as well , and whether the ices survive the process of star formation .",
    "if ( some of ) the ices survive , are they included into comets , and if so , are the ice structure and composition still the same compared to interstellar ices ? how important are energetic processes , such as cosmic ray bombardment , in altering the ice composition on the long time scale of the formation of low mass stars ?    to investigate the influence of low mass protostars on their molecular envelope , we make an infrared spectroscopic study , also called wl  15 and ylw  7 ( elias @xcite , wilking et al .",

    "these were reduced similarly to the low resolution spectrum .",
    "we found that the overall shape of the spectrum near 45  @xmath0 is quite badly affected by detector memory effects , presumably due to the occurrence of scan breaks ( de graauw et al .",
    "we corrected for this , by applying a wavelength - dependent shift to match the low resolution spectrum .",
    "this does not affect our conclusions , since the high resolution spectrum was only used to study narrow features .",

    "the gas could be concentrated in a high density photospheric layer above the disk . to sufficiently heat it by radiation from the central star ,",

    "hence , indeed the observed @xmath3 , @xmath200 , and probably `` 6.85 ''  @xmath0 ices could be associated with this extended envelope .",
    "some of the apolar co ice has evaporated in the envelope after the formation of the low mass protostar , as indicated by the significantly lower co/@xmath3 ice ratio toward , compared to other sight - lines with little thermal processing in the ices ( , elias  16 ; table  [ te29:abun ] ) . in this picture",

    "knowledge of the source structure is essential to interpret the observed solid and gas phase species .",
    "for example , if the ice is present in the disk , rather than in the envelope , we must see the disk in a near edge - on configuration .",
    "is there independent evidence for the presence of a disk surrounding and what would be its orientation ?",
    "the most direct view is provided by lunar occultation observations . a central object with diameter of @xmath91",
    "au emits 90% of the 2.2  @xmath0 continuum emission ( simon et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the remaining 10% comes primarily from an object of 60  au in diameter , which could be the hot part of a disk ( @xmath201  k ) .",

    "the disk is optically thick up to 100  @xmath0 , and becomes optically thin at longer wavelengths where the sed drops steeply ( e.g. van den ancker et al .",
    "the similarity of the seds does however not necessarily imply that is dominated by an optically thick disk as well .",
