    "we fix the following ideal triangulation @xmath2 on @xmath0 :       we use the same notation as in the previous example , so @xmath389 is the shape parameter of tetrahedron @xmath390 with respect to edge @xmath391 , and @xmath392 . from the face pairings of @xmath2",
    "we deduce the following complex - curvature and log - curvature maps :      notice that @xmath394 where the sign ambiguity depends on the argument of @xmath395 .",
    "however , applying the combinatorial gauss  bonnet theorem to the vertex , we deduce that @xmath396 hence @xmath397 we observe that @xmath117 has constant rank @xmath398 , @xmath399 moreover , for all @xmath400 , @xmath140 is the 3dimensional variety generated by the ideal @xmath401      for @xmath405 @xmath406 , so @xmath407 by analytic continuation @xmath408 and @xmath409 are disjoint , hence the above argument shows that @xmath408 and @xmath409 are disjoint complex varieties contained in the complex variety @xmath410 .",
    "moreover , because all shape parameters are assumed to have positive imaginary part , it follows from ( [ g ] ) that @xmath411 and hence @xmath412            for all @xmath420 , the restriction map @xmath421 is a local diffeomorphism onto its image .",
