    "dilaton field appears naturally both from the kaluza - klein compactification and the string spectrum .",
    "the simplest way to incorporate the scalar field as the spin-0 partner of spin-2 gravitational field is brans - dicke theory in which the gravitational coupling constant is replaced by a scalar field . in @xcite , the author considered the holographic bound in the region within the particle horizon for a general brans - dicke universe .",
    "the discussion for the case @xmath0 matter dominated is not complete because there is no analytical solution for that case . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the holographic bound for the @xmath0 matter dominated brans - dicke universe in regions within particle horizon and apparent horizon .",
    "the particle horizon idea was first proposed by fischler and susskind @xcite . because the holographic bound in the region within the particle horizon is not satisfied for closed matter dominated universe , bak and rey used the apparent horizon to solve the problem @xcite .",
    "however , kaloper and linde showed that the holographic bound in the regions within apparent horizon could be violated in the anti - de - sitter space @xcite .",
    "bousso s covariant entropy conjecture gave a means to select a null hypersurface starting from any 2 dimensional spacelike surface so that the holographic bound would be satisfied in the null hypersurface @xcite .",
    "this holographic bound can be applied to general spacetime starting from any surface .",
    "a generalized version of this conjecture was proved by flanagan , marolf and wald under some assumptions on the entropy flux @xcite .",

    "note that @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the particle horizon is @xmath10 the apparent horizon is @xmath11    the idea of holographic bound is that the matter entropy inside a spatial region @xmath12 does not exceed 1/4 of the area @xmath13 of the boundary of that region measured in planck units . from the metric ( [ metric ] ) , the holographic bound in a region with radius @xmath14 for closed universe is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the constant comoving entropy density .",
    "if we consider the spherical region inside the particle horizon @xmath17 , then the holographic bound ( [ bound ] ) becomes @xmath18 it is obvious that the bound is violated when @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the holographic bound proposed by fischler and susskind does not apply to the closed universe .",
    "if we consider the spherical region inside the apparent horizon @xmath19 , the holographic bound ( [ bound ] ) becomes @xmath20 therefore , the holographic bound is satisfied if it is satisfied initially .",
