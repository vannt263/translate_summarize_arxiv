    "particles in a plasma experience grazing collisions because they are ionized , interacting even at long distances as described by the coulomb potential .",
    "so far , the full coulomb model has been impossible to handle rigorously in a scaling limit ( see @xcite for a heuristic argument , and @xcite for a rigorous partial result ) , and the strategy has been to use an approximation by soft - sphere models with their bump - function potentials .",
    "microscopically , soft - sphere models consist of a lightweight particle traveling through a random configuration of large stationary particles , called  obstacles \" or  scatterers , \" whose shape and density are determined by a parameter .",
    "the lightweight particle grazes obstacles when it gets within their ranges of influence , called  protection \" disks . in two dimensions , this can be visualized as a ball rolling through a random field of hills .",
    "it is desirable to understand these microscopic models in the weak coupling limit , when the radius of the obstacles goes to zero , and to derive rigorously a macroscopic description in terms of a linear pde .",
    "more precisely , we introduce a parameter @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath3-th obstacle , centered at @xmath4 ( see figure [ softspheres ] ) , is described by a suitably smooth and compactly supported ( say , in the unit ball ) radial potential @xmath5 whose rescaling is : @xmath6 we use the convention of @xcite ; another convention for rescaling has @xmath7 , as in @xcite .",
    "then the microscopic dynamics for an obstacle configuration , @xmath8 , are newtonian : @xmath9    the collection of obstacle centers , @xmath10 , is a realization of the poisson point process in @xmath11 with intensity @xmath12 , e.g. , the expected number of obstacles in @xmath13 is @xmath14    the case @xmath15 , where the particle travels a relatively long distance between collisions and each obstacle has a relatively large influence , corresponds to the boltzmann - grad limit of the hard - sphere model of a dilute ( or lorenz ) gas , with the macroscopic evolution given by the boltzmann equation .",
    "( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite ; and for the quantum lorenz gas , @xcite . )    for @xmath16 $ ] , the number of obstacles must be about @xmath17 per unit of volume in order to have a net effect that is nonzero and finite ( this is more than in the boltzmann - grad limit , where the number is about @xmath18 ) .",
    "this large number of obstacles balances the small factor of @xmath19 in the rescaled potential , and as @xmath20 in this , the weak coupling limit , the macroscopic dynamics of these plasma models are given by the linear landau equation .",
    "previously , the results for this family of models were incomplete .",
    "desvillettes and ricci proved a weak version ( convergence in expectation ) of the two - dimensional weak coupling limit for @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "they approximated the landau equation by the boltzmann equation in order to use a modification of gallavotti s technique for the boltzmann - grad limit . from the outset , however , they needed @xmath0 to be small , so that the radius of each obstacle is much smaller than the expected free flight time .",
    "the method is further limited to the regime @xmath21 by an estimate of the probability of self - intersection , but can be improved to include @xmath22 ( see appendix ) .    on the other hand , kesten and papanicolaou proved a stronger convergence ( in law ) of the weak coupling limit at the upper endpoint of the parameter range , @xmath23 , for dimensions three and higher and with a general random field , called the stochastic acceleration problem @xcite .",
    "then drr , goldstein , and lebowitz proved a two - dimensional version , with the poisson distribution of obstacles @xcite .",
    "more recently , komorowski and ryzhik handled the stochastic acceleration problem in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite and @xcite for the quantum weak coupling limit . )",
    "the difficulty in the middle range of @xmath0 is that obstacles overlap a great deal more than for small @xmath0 , but their individual influence is greater than for @xmath23 .",
    "there s an additional difficulty in the two - dimensional case because the probability of self - intersections is nontrivial .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that  bad \" self - intersections ( ones that are repeated or almost tangential ) are negligible in the scaling limit . this is important because such self - intersections cause a correlation between the past and the present ( see figures [ almosttang ] and [ manyselfint ] ) , and controlling memory effects is the main difficulty in these problems . in higher dimensions",
    ", this is unnecessary , because the probability of any self - intersection is negligible in the limit .    for @xmath24",
    ", the family of stochastic processes @xmath25 converges as @xmath20 in law to the velocity diffusion @xmath26 generated by @xmath27 , the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath29 is an initial distribution of positions and velocities , and @xmath30 is the flow for the microscopic dynamics , then @xmath31 \\xrightarrow{{\\varepsilon}\\to 0 } h(t , x , v),\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the solution of the linear landau equation : @xmath33    moreover , the microscopic distinctions of the obstacles steepness and density all disappear in the scaling limit , and the models have the same macroscopic behavior :    the diffusion coefficient in , @xmath34 , is independent of @xmath2 $ ] and can be expressed by the following formula : @xmath35    the main novelties in the present paper are better estimates on clusters of overlapping obstacles and the amount of time spent interacting with each cluster . by controlling these quantities ,",
    "we show that the total influence of clusters is negligible in the scaling limit .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows :    * to prove convergence in law , we must show that the measures @xmath36 induced by the microscopic processes @xmath37 on @xmath38 ^ 2 ; \\mathbb{r}^2 \\times \\mathbb{r}^2)$ ] converge weakly to @xmath39 induced by the diffusion @xmath40 . * * to this end , we first define some stopping times to eliminate wild behavior ( e.g. , too many self - crossings , or at too small an angle ) , which is negligible in the limit ( section 2 ) . * * next we prove that the family of stopped processes is tight ( section 3 ) . * * and we identify the limit as a velocity diffusion ( section 4 ) . * then we examine , in section 5 , the particular case of convergence in expectation , using a gallavotti - type method and a combinatorial argument about clusters of obstacles .",
    "* finally , in section 6 , we prove the proposition about the diffusion coefficient being constant in @xmath0 , and show that the formulas of @xcite and @xcite agree . *",
    "the appendix contains a narrower extension of the techniques of @xcite .",
    "we prove the theorem for the processes with stopping times that can be removed for the limiting process .",
    "these cut - offs prevent wild behavior that would lead to a correlation ( the regimes of dependence in figures [ almosttang ] and [ manyselfint ] ) between the past of a trajectory and its future .",
    "first , for @xmath41 ^ 2 ; \\mathbb{r}^2 \\times \\mathbb{r}^2)$ ] , define : @xmath42 then we define the stopping times as follows .",
    "the first time the trajectory approaches its past within distance @xmath43 and with angle less than @xmath44 is cut off by @xmath45 : @xmath46 \\text { such that } { \\lvert q(s ) - q(t ) \\rvert } \\leq a , \\\\   & \\min_{u \\in [ s , t ] } p(s)\\cdot p(u ) \\leq 0 , \\text { and } \\frac { { \\lvert p(t ) \\cdot p(s ) \\rvert } } { { \\lvert p(t ) \\rvert } { \\lvert p(s ) \\rvert } } \\geq \\cos \\phi \\}.   \\end{split}\\ ] ] the first time trajectory crosses itself more than @xmath47 times is cut off by @xmath48 : @xmath49 additionally there is a velocity cut - off , to prevent the trajectory getting `` stuck '' somewhere or going too fast : @xmath50    we call the overall stopping time @xmath51 : @xmath52 these stopping times actually depend on @xmath53 , so we write the stopped processes as : @xmath54 and their induced measures are written as @xmath55 . to see that the cut - offs can be removed ,",
    "namely that @xmath55 and the measure induced by the original process , @xmath36 , have the same limit , @xmath56 , we claim that , for arbitrary @xmath57 : @xmath58    the first statement is immediate .",
    "the second follows from a self - crossing lemma in @xcite , which says roughly that tangential self - intersections are negligible .",
    "the third follows as a corollary , because the trajectory is almost surely a continuously differentiable curve .",
    "we will show that the family of processes @xmath59 is tight , to get the weak convergence of the induced measures @xmath55 .",
    "first we need some generalizations of the lemmas in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath60 4 ) .",
    "we can view the poisson point process of obstacles from the particle s perspective ( a locally poisson process denoted @xmath61 , realizations of which are measures on @xmath62 ) , and the difference ( denoted @xmath63 ) turns out to be a martingale .",
    "this is expressed in the following equation , where the first term on the right - hand side is a martingale , and the second is a measurable left - continuous process called the compensator .",
    "@xmath64    then we write the potential as @xmath65 , the stopped position process @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "it is convenient to express @xmath59 in terms of @xmath61 , : @xmath68      to control the probability of @xmath69 scatterers being found within distance @xmath70 of the particle at time @xmath71 , we introduce some notation : @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74    [ ol ] for any @xmath75 , @xmath76    the proof follows @xcite with appropriate modifications .",
    "we start from a result of the conservation of energy , with @xmath77 : @xmath78    hence @xmath79 , if @xmath69 is a bound on @xmath80    then , if we set @xmath81 we have @xmath82 that is to say , if the particle does not come close to @xmath69 scatterers at once before time @xmath83 , then @xmath84 for all @xmath71 before @xmath83 ; hence @xmath85 is bounded by @xmath86 .",
    "now we consider the square @xmath87 ^ 2 $ ] , which we call @xmath88 .",
    "if the particle is close to @xmath69 scatterers simultaneously before time @xmath83 , then @xmath89    tile @xmath88 by squares @xmath90 with side length @xmath91 and @xmath92 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath93    for each @xmath3 , cover @xmath90 symmetrically by the larger square @xmath94 of side - length @xmath95 ; this implies that @xmath96    hence , by the poisson field s translation invariance , @xmath97 markov s inequality with an exponential finishes the proof .",
    "we would like to control , again for @xmath98 , the time that the particle takes to cross the ball @xmath99 , compared to a trajectory crossing the ball with constant velocity .",
