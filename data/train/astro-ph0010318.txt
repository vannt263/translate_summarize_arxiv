    "the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( asca ) has provided data from over a dozen seyfert   galaxies to reveal the presence of iron emission lines which are broadened by a considerable fraction of the speed of light  greater than 0.2  @xmath4 in some cases ( mushotzky et al .",
    "1995 ; tanaka et al . 1995 ; nandra et al .",
    "1997a ) . the observed line profiles are the most direct evidence for the presence of supermassive ( @xmath5  m@xmath6 ) black holes in the centers of these galaxies : the spectra have distinctive skewed , double - peaked profiles which reflect the doppler and gravitational shifts associated with emitting material in a strongly curved spacetime ( chen & halpern 1989 ; fabian et al .",
    "1989 ; laor 1991 ; kojima 1991 ) .",
    "the data strongly support a model wherein the emission lines are produced by iron k@xmath0 fluorescence at 6.4  kev when optically thick , `` cold '' regions of an accretion disk ( such that the ionization state of iron is less than fe  xvii ) are externally illuminated by hard x - rays  ( george  & fabian 1991 ; matt , perola & piro 1991 ) . in one bright ,",
    "well - studied source , mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , the high signal - to - noise ratio has enabled parameters of a simple geometrically thin , relativistic model to be estimated ( tanaka et al .",

    "the model parameters which may be gleaned from line profiles include disk radii , emissivity of the disk , observed inclination angle of the disk  @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is face - on and @xmath9 is edge - on ) , and the spin parameter of the black hole , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the hole s angular momentum . if the hole is rotating , we assume that the disk lies in the equatorial plane of the black hole , as a result of the bardeen  peterson ( 1975 ) alignment mechanism , and that the disk is corotating . of these parameters ,",
    "perhaps the most problematic is the disk emissivity .",
    "the distribution of the hard x - ray flux which illuminates the disk determines the emissivity of the fluorescing disk material , and therefore has a strong influence on line profiles .",
    "the emissivity is usually assumed to be axisymmetric .",
    "this is reasonable if the observed profile is obtained with a long integration time since strong asymmetries presumably would average out .",
    "specific choices for emissivity include a power - law in radius ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ; bromley , chen  & miller 1997 ) , a form consistent with a point source of illumination ( matt , fabian  & ross 1993 ; matt , fabian  & ross 1996 ; reynolds & begelman 1997 ) , and a function proportional to the total energy flux in the page & thorne ( 1974 ) accretion model ( dabrowski et al .",
    "dabrowski et al .",
    "( 1997 ) also considered a non - parametric form of the emissivity function . recently , iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1999 ) performed a line - profile fit assuming nonaxisymmtric x - ray illumination of the disk in mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "nonaxisymmetric emissivity might be expected for the bright state of this source if the mass of the central black hole is @xmath12 . in this case",
    "the integration time of the observations is shorter than the orbital period at a radius of a few times that of the horizon .",
    "the calculation of emissivity may be complicated somewhat by the local physics of the disk as well as the nature of the illuminating source .",
    "if the incident radiation is strong it can cause iron to become highly or fully ionized . for iron atoms at ionization stages",
    "no higher than fe  , k@xmath0 emission occurs at 6.4  kev , however , resonant absorption and successive auger processes prevent significant line emission by fe   through fe  .",
    "lithium and helium  like ions , fe   and fe  , emit at approximately 6.7  kev , while hydrogen  like ion fe   produce k@xmath0 line at 6.97  kev ( matt et al .",
    "1996 ; matt et al .  1993 ; see also the review by fabian et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "local anisotropy of rest - frame emission is another effect which can influence an observed line profile .",
    "it is often assumed that the emitter is locally isotropic , although laor  ( 1991 ) considered limb darkening and matt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) considered effects of resonant absorption and scattering which can result in anisotropic emission .    the next level of detail in modeling local disk physics was to consider non - keplerian flows , as when material falls within the innermost stable orbit around a schwarzschild black hole ( reynolds & begelman 1997 ) , or when there is turbulence in a disk of finite thickness ( pariev & bromley 1998 ) .",
    "more recently , temporal variations in line profiles ( lee et al . , 2000 ;",
    "iwasawa et al .",
    ", 1999 ; nandra et al . , 1999 ) have been observed .",
    "simulations of line profiles with a time - dependent illumination ( reynolds et al .",
    "1999 ; young & reynolds , 2000 ; ruszkowski 1999 ) are also performed .",
    "knowledge of the line variability can provide information about the size of the inner region of the accretion disk and the mass of a black hole .    to circumvent uncertainties in the emissivity of the disk and yet still obtain estimates and constraints of fundamental disk parameters such as the inner radius , bromley , miller & pariev ( 1998 ) suggested using the minimum and maximum frequency shifts of a broad emission line as a diagnostic . as first demonstrated by cunningham ( 1975 ) , the edges of a line profile from an emitting disk annulus uniquely determine the radius of the annulus and its inclination .",
    "similarly , bounds may placed on these parameters when the emission comes from many such annuli .",
    "these bounds are more robust indicators than estimates derived by fitting the full profile shape when the emissivity is nonaxisymmetric or when the continuum has been poorly modeled in the central regions of the broad lines .    in this work",
    "we use the method of line frequency extrema to study the geometric and kinematic properties of relativistic accretion disks .",
    "we provide new methods of line edge detection based on polynomial fits to the line profile and continuum , and compare the results to the @xmath13 rejection technique used by bromley , miller & pariev ( 1998 ) . in   2 we describe the minimum and maximum frequency diagnostic and ways to determine the position of a line edge and its error . in ",
    "3 we apply the technique to the iron line profiles from mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , ngc  4151 , and ngc  3516 , and we compare the results of the edge fitting to the fitting of the whole line profile .",
    "finally , we discuss prospects for our method with data from future x - ray missions .",
    "the information contained in a line profile is rich , but the parameter space of models is also fairly large . here , as in bromley , miller & pariev ( 1998 ) , we sacrifice detailed modeling for broad characteristics of the accretion disk by examining only the edges of the line .",
    "the gain is a reduced dependence on unrealistic model assumptions such as axisymmetric emissivity or the behavior of the continuum emission over the entire frequency range of the line .",
    "for example , the usual continuum model is a power law in frequency , but there is evidence from iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that the index can vary in time .",
    "since the lines are extraordinarily broad , one risks the possibility of a poor guess for the continuum which would affect the shape of the inferred profile .",
    "this in turn can affect inferences of the disk model parameters , including inner and outer radii .",
    "worse , the profile might also be misinterpreted because our assumptions of axisymmetry might be incorrect , a possibility which is worrisome in light of time variability of the continuum and line profile .",
    "for example , patchy , local flares would violate axisymmetry unless the observed line profile were integrated over a long period of time .    from cunningham ( 1975 )",
    ", it is clear that minimum and maximum frequency shifts of a line profile themselves contain information about fundamental disk parameters , regardless of details which may complicate the shape of the profile . here",
    "we use the frequency extrema diagnostic for both standard infinitesimally thin disk case and for the disk model taking into account turbulent broadening and additional frequency shifts of the line due to doppler effect associated with the accretion inflow and correction to the gravitational redshift because of the elevation of the line emitting spots above the equatorial plane of the disk . for the latter case we use results by pariev  & bromley ( 1998 ) for the line profiles emitted from the surface of the `` standard '' @xmath0-disk ( novikov & thorne 1973 ) . the parameters which uniquely define the system of black hole and accretion disk are the mass of the black hole @xmath14 , spin parameter of the black hole @xmath15 , and inclination of the disk relative to the observer @xmath7 .",
    "the shape of a time - independent line profile can not provide us with the absolute scale of the system , @xmath16 , although variable features in the profile can indicate the black hole mass . in the present work we deal only with time - averaged observations ,",
    "hence the mass @xmath14 enters only as degenerate scale factor with disk radius . in the case of the shakura  & sunyaev ( 1973 ) @xmath0-disk model ,",
    "additional model parameters include the luminosity of the disk in eddington units , @xmath17 , and a viscosity parameter @xmath0 .",
    "of course , with fixed values for these parameters , an observation of the luminosity can constrain the black hole mass .    here",
    "we first define @xmath18 and @xmath19 to be the minimum and maximum frequency shifts of a line relative to the rest - frame frequency .",
    "then we consider emission from an infinitesimal annulus of the disk with boyer - lindquist radius @xmath20 . for a given value of the spin parameter @xmath15 ( as well as luminosity @xmath21 and viscosity parameter @xmath0 for a thick disk ) there exists a unique mapping @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , connecting frequency extrema of a line and the inclination angle @xmath7 and radius @xmath20 of the annulus .",
    "an example of such a mapping is given in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "note that we use units of gravitational radius , @xmath24 , so that for a nonrotating black hole the radius of event horizon is @xmath25 , and the radius of the innermost stable orbit is @xmath26 ; for the maximally rotating astrophysical black hole with @xmath27 ( thorne 1974 ) , the radius of the event horizon decreases to @xmath28 and the accretion disk becomes stabilized down to the radius @xmath29 .",
    "it is this extension of the stable disk down to small radii which is the most prominent effect of rotation of the black hole .",
    "emission in an observed line consists of the sum of contributions from many infinitesimal annuli .",
    "these annuli produce a curve in the @xmath30@xmath31 plane , which corresponds to a single , constant inclination angle @xmath7 .",
    "of course a measured profile will generate a single point in this plane which is simply the extreme values of redshift and blueshift along a constant-@xmath7 curve .",
    "the position of the measured point in the @xmath30@xmath32 diagram indicates that emission can come only from the quadrant of the @xmath30@xmath31 plane defined by inequalities @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "at the same time , some emission must come from the points on both sides of this quadrant , i.e. from the points having either @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "the position of this point can fix the range of possible disk inclination angles @xmath7 : since @xmath30 increases with increasing @xmath20 along the curve @xmath37 , the upper limit on inclination angle of the disk is given by the value of @xmath7 for the curve @xmath37 passing through the data point .",
    "the lower limit is provided by the @xmath37 curve which just touches the horizontal line @xmath38 . if @xmath39 , then the lower limit for @xmath7 is 0 .",
    "furthermore , for each @xmath7 within the observed bounds one can determine the outer @xmath40 and inner @xmath41 radii of annulus , which give a contribution to the observed profile .",
    "generally , the middle regions of the disk can have arbitrary amounts of iron line emission , but there must always be some emission coming from points of the disk surface at radii @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    if several line profiles are available for the same object in different phases of emissivity , then we may be able to place further constraints on the inclination angle of the disk and to check the validity of the accretion disk model ( i.e. that bounds for @xmath7 are not mutually exclusive ) .",
    "narrower limits for @xmath7 put tighter constrains on @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we emphasize that these constraints are independent of the emissivity law across the disk .    as mentioned above , by looking only at the position of the edges of line profiles we clearly lose a large amount of the information contained in the shape of a line profile .",
    "we instead obtain very strong bounds on the inner radius and inclination angle of the disk . in the case of time variability over time",
    "scales not resolved during photon counts integration time , positions of the frequency extrema are still able to provide estimates of the inclination angle of the disk and bounds for the inner edge of the disk .",
    "this is an important feature when there are changes in the disk illumination and/or possible obscuration of parts of the disk by absorbers ( weaver & yaqoob 1998 ) which can substantially alter the main core of the line .",
    "another advantage of looking only at the positions of the edges of the line is that it circumvents the effects on the line profile of possible resonant absorption of the line photons in the disk corona .",
    "as shown by ruszkowski & fabian ( 1999 ) , reasonable assumptions about the velocity field in the corona of the disk suggest that an absorption feature is located slightly redward of @xmath46 leaving the red and blue edges of the line unaffected . in this case",
    "a direct fit of the profile with a standard keplerian disk model would give poor results .",
    "the frequency extrema method does not require detailed models of absorbing corona or occulting cloud , nor is it sensitive to the reflection from a surrounding torus or any other sources of narrow @xmath47 iron line emission except in the rare instances when the disk is observed almost directly face - on and all disk emission is reddened .",
    "we used a general purpose ray - tracing code to calculate values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for a number of narrow rings and a number of different inclinations @xmath7 .",
    "the code , described by bromley , chen  & miller ( 1997 ) , generates a pixelized image of the accretion disk as would be seen by a distant observer .",
    "the observed frequency at each pixel is given by @xmath48 where subscripts @xmath49 and @xmath50 are observer and emitter respectively , @xmath51 is the 4-velocity of the emitter and @xmath52 is the emitted photon s 4-momentum .",
    "note that the emitter 4-velocity is specified by the disk model , while the photon 4-momentum is calculated by numerically tracing the photon geodesic back in time from the pixel in the observer s sky plane to the surface of the disk .",
    "then , we sort pixels into narrow rings and determine extrema of @xmath53 over all pixels fallen into a ring between @xmath20 and @xmath54 . to create a grid of lines",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath55 on @xmath30@xmath31 plane we use cubic spline interpolation .",
    "the ray tracer itself is a general - purpose second - order geodesic solver for a kerr geometry .",
    "an arbitrary disk surface can be specified so that the photon trajectories terminate on this surface .",
    "for axisymmetric geometries the number of individual geodesics which need to be traced numerically in order to produce complete set of images is of the same order as in the method of transfer functions by laor ( 1991 ) .",
    "using of parallel supercomputer allowed us to compute an image of 1000@xmath561000 pixels during about 1 minute of run - time .",
    "details about modeling the emitter 4-velocity , @xmath51 in equation  ( [ eq : gee ] ) , can be found in pariev  & bromley ( 1998 ) . here , we assume that outside of the orbit of marginal stability the bulk emitter 4-velocity is the sum of a keplerian 4-velocity and a small , inward radial velocity component as given by novikov  & thorne ( 1973 ) .",
    "we do not take into account the @xmath57 component of inflow velocity , nor the dependence of @xmath58 component of velocity on the height of the disk .",
    "these are higher order corrections to radially directed inflow . inside of the marginal stability radius ,",
    "all orbits are presumed to be in free - fall in the equatorial plane with integrals of motion equal to the values at the innermost stable orbit .",
    "we assume a simple model for turbulent motion in the disk , with an isotropic gaussian distribution of turbulent velocities with the square mean equal to the square of the speed of sound @xmath59 averaged over the disk thickness , namely @xmath60\\frac{1}{\\nu_e}\\label{broad}\\mbox{,}\\ ] ] where the intensity @xmath61 at a specified frequency @xmath62 depends upon the rest frame energy of the @xmath63 line ( @xmath64 ) , the angle cosine @xmath65 of the photon emission with respect to the normal of the disk as measured in the source frame , and the radial coordinate @xmath66 of the emitting material on the surface of the disk ; @xmath67 is the surface emissivity ; @xmath68 is the sound speed at the radius of emission ,  @xmath66 .",
    "we consider only the case of isotropic emission , when @xmath69 .",
    "the width of a gaussian line profile in the comoving frame with the disk surface is @xmath70 . the sound speed at a radius @xmath66 is proportional to the accretion rate and , therefore , to the luminosity of the disk ( shakura  & sunyaev 1973 ; novikov  & thorne 1973 ; equation  [ 15 ] in pariev  & bromley 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , the amount of smearing of the line at a given radius is proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "note , that the actual turbulent velocities may have a mean value less than the speed of sound ( see pariev  & bromley  1998 for details ) , thus we are considering the maximum possible effect of turbulence on line profiles .",
    "turbulent broadening causes the whole line profile to be smoothed .",
    "particularly , blue and red edges are no longer sharp but have wings of the order of @xmath71 at the radii where the edges of the profile are formed .",
    "accretion inflow causes a slight shift of the profile to the red , but does not strongly influence the position of the profile edges , since the edges are formed in regions of the disk which have radial inflow velocities nearly perpendicular to the light ray emerging toward the position of the observer .    adding a gaussian turbulent velocity spectrum makes the determination of edges of a theoretical line profile somewhat uncertain .",
    "moreover , the observed extent of a line depends upon the signal  to  noise ratio of the observational data . keeping in mind that our gaussian prescription for turbulent broadening is crude and velocities of turbulent motions along line of sight can not exceed the speed of sound , we assume the following procedure for finding the minimum and maximum redshifts in the case of a turbulent disk model with finite thickness and accretion inflow : we add the value of @xmath72 to the uncorrected @xmath73 in order to obtain @xmath31 and subtract the value of @xmath74 from the uncorrected @xmath30 in order to obtain @xmath30 .",
    "this procedure is also consistent with a signal  to  noise ratio of about 10% in currently available observational data for line profiles .",
    "the grid of @xmath30@xmath31 obtained in this way was used in all estimates of parameters of thick disk model and is shown by dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig5 ] for nonrotating and extremely ( @xmath27 ) rotating black holes . to determine the greatest possible effect of the physical structure of the disk",
    ", we have chosen a high disk luminosity , @xmath75 , and an @xmath0 viscosity parameter of @xmath76 .",
    "these values still consistent with an optically thick disk .",
    "the main effect kinematics and finite disk thickness is to yield larger values for @xmath31 and smaller values for @xmath30 . for a nonrotating black hole",
    "the disk extends down to @xmath77 , at which point the thickness of the disk as well as radial inflow velocity approach zero , while the surface density increases without bound ( novikov & thorne 1973 )  this is a consequence of the zero - torque boundary condition at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "thus the difference between the thin and thick disk models vanishes at @xmath77 . in reality",
    ", the gas smoothly transits near @xmath77 from a slow inward spiral caused by viscous stresses to a plunging geodesic orbit into the black hole .",
    "nonzero viscous torque and radial inflow should also change the parameters of the disk just beyond the @xmath77 orbit ( e.g. beloborodov , abramowicz  & novikov , 1997 ) .",
    "thus , the shape of the dashed curves in fig .  [ fig1 ] for @xmath78 should be altered for more realistic situations so that the transition from @xmath79 to @xmath80 is smoothed out and dashed lines should move upward and to the left near the @xmath81 curve of the thin disk model .",
    "agol & krolik  ( 2000 ) consider thin - disk structure when there is a finite time - steady torque on the inner edge of the disk .",
    "according to them , additional dissipation near innermost edge of the disk due to the applied torque would cause increased heating and increased sound speed compared to novikov - thorne disk .",
    "larger sound speed causes dashed lines on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] to move upward and to the left . however , paczynski  ( 2000 ) points out that any torque at the innermost stable circular orbit should be small as soon as the disk is thin and @xmath82 .",
    "the subject of the transition from nearly keplerian flow to rapid infall to the black hole is under active investigation ( e.g. , gammie 1999 ) .",
    "we only mention that our method of line frequency extrema diagnostic could be used to put constrains on models resulting from such investigations , but this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the deviation of frequency extrema plots for disks of finite thickness from those for infinitely thin disks scales as @xmath83 with the total thermal luminosity of the disk @xmath21 , while the exact value of the @xmath0 parameter is not nearly as important ( pariev  & bromley , 1998 ) .",
    "when then accretion rate and the ratio @xmath17 decrease , the sound speed , radial inflow velocity and thickness of the disk also decrease . in the limit of very small accretion rates and very small @xmath17 , the solid and dashed grids in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] becomes coincident .",
    "for very low accretion rates the disk can be regarded as thin , with each light - emitting element moving on a circular keplerian trajectory with little turbulent broadening .",
    "blending of emission lines having different rest - frame frequencies would influence results of using frequency extrema method .",
    "the most important sources of blending can be the presence of k@xmath0 emission from highly ionized iron , emission of iron k@xmath84 at @xmath85 , and nickel k@xmath0 @xmath86 line ( george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "the most difficult to estimate is the contribution of the hot ( i.e. , highly ionized ) iron k@xmath0 line .",
    "hot disks can fluoresce in the k@xmath0 line under certain circumstances , depending on the three - dimensional temperature structure of the disk .",
    "these issues were given consideration by matt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , matt et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and ycki  & czerny  ( 1994 ) :",
    "the basic conclusion reached by these authors is that the rest - frame frequency , intensity , and angular dependence of the emission are determined by the value of the ionization parameter @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the x - ray illuminating power - law flux striking a unit area of the disk surface , and @xmath89 is a comoving hydrogen number density . in order to determine @xmath90 one must know the characteristics of the source of illuminating x - rays such as its intensity , spatial distribution , and motion relative to the disk .",
    "some aspects of the dependence of the line profile and equivalent width on these characteristics have been outlined in reynolds  & begelman  ( 1997 ) and reynolds  & fabian  ( 1997 ) .",
    "our estimate of the parameter @xmath90 along the lines described in reynolds  & begelman  ( 1997 ) shows that for a thin @xmath0disk around a schwarzschild black hole it can plausibly lie either above or below the threshold value for ionization @xmath91 , depending upon x - ray efficiency of the illuminating source and its spectral index . for the kerr case when the disk extends close to the event horizon , relativistic aberrations of the illuminating radiation due to gravity , frame dragging , and the motion of material in the disk become very significant , generally leading to the enhancement of the irradiating flux as measured in the comoving frame of the disk material .",
    "consequently , the parts of the disk at small radii are more likely to emit hot iron lines @xmath92 and @xmath93 . however , due to resonant scattering and auger processes , little line emission is produced in the transition region from cold to hot iron lines .",
    "furthermore , in regions where lines can form , x - ray flares above the disk can cause higher ionization of the disk surface directly below the flare than the rest of the disk .",
    "all this makes the analysis of the iron line profile complicated and dependent upon unknown positions of illuminating x - ray sources , accretion rates and mass of the central black hole .",
    "we assume that the iron k@xmath0 line has @xmath46 rest frame energy everywhere in the accretion disk .",
    "for all observational data considered here , the core of the line is centered close to @xmath46 , while higher energies for the core can be ruled out with very large degree of confidence .",
    "this means that parts of the disk not very close to the black hole ( @xmath94 ) , where the core of the line is formed , produce the cold iron @xmath46 line .",
    "one is not so certain about inner parts of the disk producing the red tail of the line , but we assume that the k@xmath0 line has the rest frame energy of @xmath46 throughout the disk .",
    "the maximum possible error in finding @xmath30 introduced by this assumption is @xmath95 , which in most cases is no more than the size of @xmath96 error box for the values of @xmath30 for the present quality of x - ray observations .",
    "since the k@xmath84 @xmath85 line is emitted by the same iron atoms that are responsible for the k@xmath0 line , the shape of the two profiles should be the same .",
    "the ratio of fluorescent yields in k@xmath84 and k@xmath0 lines is @xmath97 ( george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "if one makes the reasonable assumption that nickel is distributed over the disk surface in the same way as iron , then the profile of nickel k@xmath0 line will be similar to that of iron , but shifted by @xmath98 .",
    "the relative abundance of nickel with respect to iron is not known precisely for observed sources but a reasonable value is about @xmath99 ( george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "the fact that the iron k@xmath84 line and the nickel k@xmath0 line are faint compared to iron k@xmath0 allows us to perform an effective decomposition of the blended profile into the sum of individual profiles of three lines .",
    "if @xmath100 is the observed excess of photon counts per second over the fitted continuum , and @xmath101 is the actual profile of iron k@xmath0 line , then one has the relation @xmath102 here we will use the term `` energy - corrected profile '' for the function @xmath103 .",
    "one can solve this equation for @xmath103 iteratively , feeding approximations to the function for the contributions from the k@xmath84 and nickel lines . as an initial guess , we take @xmath104 and each subsequent approximation @xmath105 is obtained using previous values of @xmath106 : @xmath107 the actual data points are the integrals of a continuous energy distribution within energy bins .",
    "the accuracy in determining @xmath101 , which we need according to the quality of the data , is of the order of a few per cent .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient for our purposes to treat data points just as a discrete samples of the underlying continuous function .",
    "we computed values of @xmath108 at the center of each energy bin , linearly interpolating between bins to obtain values of @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "when the shifted frequency went beyond the red boundary of the observed data , we used a value of zero for the shifted profile .",
    "for the data considered here , the iteration procedure converged with sufficient accuracy in only two iterations .",
    "the main effect of the blending correction is to suppress the blue wing of the line or perhaps create an `` absorption '' feature if the blue wing is weak or absent .",
    "we compared results of determining @xmath31 using uncorrected and energy - corrected profiles for the same observation , we found that only in the data with the highest signal - to - noise was there a difference in the detected edge position of greater than @xmath96 .",
    "thus , at the quality of present x - ray spectral data for most seyfert galaxies , the corrections for blending with lines other than iron k@xmath0 line are small .",
    "we are interested in the determining boundary between the line and continuum , not the full profile shape , and we now argue that we can work with the observed counts directly without restoring actual x - ray fluxes by deconvolving with the response matrix of the x - ray detector .",
    "all the data considered below were obtained with the asca sis detector ; its sensitivity to a monochromatic line varies by a factor of five over the 3 - 8  kev waveband , with the response function broadening the signal by about 100  ev .",
    "one or two satellite peaks also appear at a level not exceeding 3% of the intensity of the main line .",
    "the frequency of the satellite peak is about two thirds that of the initial line .",
    "in addition , the monochromatic line produces a small continuous response in each channel with counts less than 1% of the counts in the channel at the peak .",
    "the magnitudes of detector response effects are well within the errors of the observed intensity of the line and the spread over 100  ev is comparable to smallest standard error in the position of the edges measured here ( see tables  1 and  2 with the results for edges ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that folding the broad line and continuum spectrum through the detector response matrix does not have significant ( i.e. more than one standard error ) influence on the locations of the line edges .    to locate the edge of a line profile , we start with an unconvolved , continuum - subtracted , energy - corrected line profile as observed in the restframe of the host galaxy ( i.e. , cosmological redshift has been removed ) .",
    "the continuum subtraction was performed differently by different observers : iwasawa et al .",

    "however , this reflection component affects line flux by only about 5 per cent .",
    "wang et al .  ( 1999 ) fitted the continuum in the 1.04.0 and 8.010.0  kev band with a model which consists of a dual absorbed power law with some fraction ( about 5 per cent ) of the direct continuum scattered into our line of sight and absorbed only by the galactic column .",
    "compton reflection was not included in this fit since there is no reliable indication of the existence of the reflection in this object .",
    "nandra et al .",
    "( 1999 ) fitted the continuum in the 3.04.0 and 7.010.0  kev range by a single power law only .",
    "we need to examine only sections of the profile containing a suspected line edge and fit the profile with a linear , polynomial model @xmath112 in frequency @xmath113 . in most instances ,",
    "a quadratic fit gives the best results , since the cubic term added artificial oscillations to the fit .",
    "a linear @xmath13 method determines the polynomial coefficients @xmath114 , and these in turn provide roots of the polynomial model . the real root ( if it exists ) which is closest to the center of the line is taken as the position of the edge .",
    "to estimate the error in measuring the energy of the edge of the line using the roots of a best - fit polynomial we use monte - carlo realizations of the observed counts : each profile consists of a number of counts @xmath115 in energy channels spanning the intervals from @xmath116 to @xmath117 , where @xmath118 are the central energies of each channel number @xmath7 , @xmath119 are half  widths of the channels .",
    "the half  widths of the channels increase with increasing energy and range from about 50  ev at 3  kev to about 700  ev at 9  kev . for each real observed profile we create 20000 artificial data sets by randomly drawing a flux value @xmath120 from a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath115 and variance equal to the width of @xmath120-error bar @xmath121 .",
    "then we perform a @xmath13 minimization of each artificial data set to get the best - fit polynomials and their roots .",
    "repeating this procedure for all 20000 monte - carlo data sets allows us to construct a probability distribution for the location of the line edges determined in this way .",
    "generally , such distributions are skewed with tails extending out from the center of the line .",
    "we calculate the mean and the variance of this distribution of edges .",
    "then , we take the mean as the best approximation for the true position of the edge and variance as a standard error of this edge determination . to be more conservative in light of the fact that the distribution of best - fit values is not strictly gaussian , we take our final values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 to have error boxes twice as large as the standard error given by monte - carlo distribution of fits . in most cases ,",
    "the ellipse in the @xmath122-@xmath31 plane with semimajor axes that are twice the standard errors contain 95% of all roots found .",
    "the results of fitting with the polynomial model are given in table  1 .",
    "for the fits we choose only channels on one side of the line peak , either red or blue depending on which edge we are looking for .",
    "each set of channels are continuous in energy and define some interval which brackets a line edge , i.e. , the interval contains regions where the spectrum is well - fit to the continuum model as well as channels which exhibit clear and significant signal from line emission .",
    "once chosen , the set of channels remains the same for all fits in a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "the actual energy range covered by the fitting intervals varies substantially for different profiles depending on how sharp is the transition from the line to continuum .",
    "roughly , energy range is about 23  kev for the red edge and 12  kev for the blue edge . instead of specifying the energy range for each fit we choose to number all points on the plot of the profile and to list those which are used in a particular fit .",
    "the points are numbered consecutively with the point number  1 referring to the redmost channel .",
    "the numbers of points used in the fits are given in the third column of table  1 .",
    "we also propose a non - linear `` sharp edge '' model to locate a line edge . in this model",
    "the continuum is exactly zero and the line is a linear or quadratic piece which extends from the continuum to higher intensities . at the red edge of a line",
    "the model is @xmath123 while for the blue edge @xmath124 where in the last case @xmath125 is negative .",
    "the line edge is @xmath126 , the location of the kink which delineates the flat continuum and the regions of increasing flux @xmath126 .    as with the polynomial fitting , we determine the distribution of @xmath126 in many monte - carlo realizations , and take the mean and variance of this distribution as the estimated position of the edge and its corresponding uncertainty .",
    "the fitting function ( [ fitred])-([fitblue ] ) is not smooth and this causes many fits to give @xmath126 values very close to a mean channel frequency @xmath118 , mimicking a discrete distribution .",
    "therefore , the cumulative distribution of @xmath127 looks like the sum of several step functions .",
    "the contour around the mean point @xmath122@xmath31 determined from the monte carlo simulations which characterizes the scatter in the @xmath30@xmath31 simulation points is rectangular in shape rather than the usual ellipse ( as in the case of gaussian distributed @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "we verified that for most fits the rectangle , centered on the mean value for the monte - carlo simulated @xmath30 and @xmath31 values and having sides equal to twice the variance of the monte - carlo simulations , contains about 95% of fitting points inside it .",
    "we plot these @xmath96 `` error - rectangles '' as well as best fit to actual data points on the @xmath30@xmath31 diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig5][fig7 ] . in order to make figs .",
    "[ fig6][fig7 ] easier to read , we use asymmetric error bars instead of full `` error rectangles . ''",
    "these error bars originate at the point corresponding to the best fit to the actual data .",
    "the ends of all four error bar segments define the error rectangle , i.e. the length of each of the four error bars is equal to the distance between best fit point and an edge of the rectangle .",
    "all our conclusions about disk geometry assume that the error distributions lie within such rectangles .",
    "table  2 shows edge estimates based on this non - linear model , analogous to table  1 .    in order to verify that the non - linear model gives reasonable determinations of the positions of the line edges we applied the same monte - carlo method for finding the edge of an artificial line profile",
    "this mock line profile was created from a real profile in the following way . starting with the same energy channels @xmath128 as for the real data set , we find the best fit of the non - linear model to the actual data set @xmath129 and take values of @xmath130 of this fit .",
    "then , using error values corresponding to the real data we apply the same monte - carlo procedure of finding the edge of the artificial data set and thus determine the distribution of the parameter @xmath126 .",
    "generally , we obtain the smaller errors and lower @xmath13 for this type of fit , while the one standard error intervals for @xmath126 found by both monte - carlo simulations are overlapping ( see few exceptions for poor quality edges below ) .",
    "this result is expected since the most likely profile for the data is the actual measured points , while the most likely profile for any given monte carlo realization is the underlying model profile .",
    "which model , polynomial or non - linear , better approximates the true shape of observed profile ?",
    "theoretically one expects that the profile formed by a thin keplerian disk has sharp edges .",
    "let us consider the part of the disk surface near the innermost edge of the disk , where the reddest photons near the red edge of the line with frequencies from @xmath30 to @xmath131 are emitted .",
    "this part of the disk has the shape of the crescent elongated along the inner edge of the disk ( e.g. , fig .  8 in luminet 1979 , or color figures in bromley",
    "et al . 1997 ; pariev  & bromley 1998 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the area of this crescent is @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , the flux ( or photon counts ) per unit frequency near the red edge of the line should be @xmath133 ( if the illumination intensity does not approach zero at the inner edge of the disk ) .",
    "certainly , the coefficient in these proportionalities gets very small for rapidly rotating black holes because of the large gravitational redshift close to the event horizon and strong relativistic decrease of the intensity of the emitted x - rays .",
    "the whole area of the disk , where the red edge of the line is formed ( @xmath134 ) , is also small .",
    "the part of the disk forming the bluest photons has an elliptic shape centered at a point far from the event horizon .",
    "similar consideration for the blue edge of the line gives @xmath135 .",
    "however , the coefficient here is large , because the region on the disk surface producing the bluest photons is relatively large .",
    "it is for this reason that observed line profiles show much sharper , well - defined blue edges .",
    "sharp red edges can be noticed only for slowly rotating black holes but become less prominent for rotating black holes . indeed",
    ", line profiles for a schwarzschild system , calculated with high resolution , have a much more distinctive sharp red edge ( e.g. , fig .  5 in pariev  & bromley 1998 ) than in the case of an extreme kerr metric . ( e.g. , fig .  6 in pariev  & bromley 1998 ) .",
    "while polynomial fitting does not take into account the theoretically expected shape of the edge profile , the nonlinear model ( [ fitred])-([fitblue ] ) is an approximation to the real edge .",
    "however , many observed profiles do not show easily discernible sharp edges in the presence of noise .",
    "in particular , red edges have the appearance of smooth transits between line and continuum .",
    "blue edges are sharper , but are often accompanied by a trough at higher frequencies . hence even in this case , the blue edge is often better described by the polynomial model than the non - linear model with its zero - continuum requirement . as a result the latter is seen to have large errors in most cases . however , when blue edges occur without a significant negative trough , the nonlinear model gives a better fit than the polynomial profile .",
    "we have demonstrated through monte carlo experiments that we can obtain reasonable values for line edges and get good estimates of uncertainties .",
    "we checked that our technique is not sensitive to the functional form of the line profile , a test which indicates how robust our method is to the emissivity function of the disk and the energy - dependent detector response .",
    "specifically , we verified that our fitting technique gives values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 that are not overly sensitive to the multiplication of the data by a smoothly varying , positive definite function .",
    "this procedure resulted in substantial changes in the variance of estimated roots .",
    "if the function does not change greatly in the vicinity of the edge , the new mean of monte - carlo simulations remained within the largest of the one @xmath136-errors for the non - modified and modified data sets .    we also checked our method using two functions , one on either side of the best fit line edge , each giving a multiplicative factor which modifies the observed intensity , to vary both the line and the continuum independently . by choosing particular shapes for these function",
    "one can either augment or suppress the line with respect to the continuum data adjacent to the line .",
    "this mimics the effect of increasing or decreasing the emissivity of that part of the disk which contributes to the line edge .",
    "it turns out that multiplication by such a function can significantly change the error in the determination of the edge but the location of the edge itself still remains within the largest of the one @xmath136 errors for the original and modified data . in the case where the line is suppressed and the tail of the line became very shallow , the error in the position of the edge increases .",
    "conversely , highlighting the line and suppressing fluctuations in the continuum decreases the error .",
    "these tests indicate that the monte - carlo method gives robust estimates of the position of the edge without great sensitivity to the details of the disk emissivity function .",
    "certainly , there are limits .",
    "for example , if the disk is illuminated in an inhomogeneous fashion as a result of flares located close to the disk surface , the line contribution from a highly localized region of the disk could be mistaken for the red edge of the whole profile . in this case",
    "one would miss a faint red tail extending beyond this jump and get an overestimate of the inner extension of the accretion disk .    as discussed below",
    ", our monte carlo procedure worked poorly for estimating line edges in some particularly noisy data sets such as those of iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the dark minimum ( dm ) and bright flare ( bf ) states of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "the best fit for the red edge in dm data gives negative values for @xmath126 , while the monte - carlo scattering of points around best fit for the red edge in bf data gives negative mean value of @xmath126 in sharp contrast with the best fit of @xmath137 to the actual data points .",
    "to evaluate the position of the red edge in these noisy data sets we can formulate alternative methods for line edge detection which are based more directly on statistical properties of the line . for example , given a set of flux measurements as a function of energy , we could test the hypothesis that the fluxes are all consistent with continuum emission , using @xmath13 to measure of goodness - of - fit ( e.g. , bromley , miller & pariev 1998 ) .",
    "an edge detection algorithm then might be to test the continuum hypothesis on the red - most channels , including successively bluer channels until the continuum hypothesis can be rejected at some specified level of confidence . the edge of the line",
    "would then identified with the energy of the bluest channel .    in principle , this `` running @xmath13 '' method is conservative .",
    "it requires only that enough channels be sufficiently different from the continuum that we can reject the continuum model . if the continuum were extremely well sampled , then possibly a sequence of outlying fluxes all packed at , say , the blue end of the set of channels could be dismissed as merely expected statistical fluctuations .",
    "a less conservative method should consider correlations between the fluxes in neighboring channels to enable a more sensitive edge detection .",
    "a further drawback of the running @xmath13 method is that it can not distinguish between absorption and emission features . in practice",
    ", one can replace the flux in suspected absorption regions with exact continuum values or even randomly generated values . to down weight the effects of possible absorption features",
    "we also consider a `` sign '' statistic to estimate the likelihood that a set of fluxes contains a line edge .",
    "specifically , we count the number of fluxes above and below the continuum and compare with the expected binomial distribution .",
    "we applied both these methods to the line profile data and obtained limits on the red edge of the lines in the iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) deep minimum and bright flare data .",

    "[ fig2]a and  [ fig2]b , [ fig6]a and  [ fig6]b , one can see that the model of a thick disk around nonrotating black hole with the luminosity of @xmath151 is enough to bring the lower bound on @xmath7 from the position of the int data point down to @xmath1 . to reduce the most probable inclination estimate from the five data points ( t,97,97b , int , bf ) to @xmath1 requires higher accretion rates at a level of @xmath152 .",

    "if one believes that the luminosity of the accretion disk is 60% of the eddington limit , one can conclude that the black hole in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 can not rotate at the maximum rate , since disks around fast rotating kerr black holes do not have turbulent velocities high enough to make a @xmath1 inclination angle consistent with @xmath31 for the `` int '' data point . together with the lower bound for @xmath15 from the @xmath30 values of the reddest observed line profiles ( see below ) this leads to the estimate of @xmath158 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that knowledge of the accretion disk luminosity can lead to a value of @xmath15 from the position of the blue edge of the line . in the future , with improved understanding of the inner disk structure , one can hope to use the shape and position of the blue edge of the profile to obtain a better quantitative estimate of @xmath15 .",

    "the most probable innermost radius of emission as determined by the 97a and dm points with an assumed inclination angle of @xmath1 is 45@xmath160 , and it is still within 6@xmath160 for our higher inclination angle estimates .",
    "the location of the inner edge of the disk at these radii corresponds to the rotational parameter @xmath161 to be in the range between @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "since there is no significant iron absorption edge in the dm and 97a profiles , it is unlikely that any free - falling gas below innermost stable orbit can account for the observed extended red tails ( young , ross , & fabian , 1998 ) .",
    "if the red tails of the dm and 97a profiles are produced by the emission of ionized iron , this will decrease @xmath122 by a few per cent and make the estimates of the innermost radius of the disk even smaller and the rotational parameter @xmath161 even higher .",

    "the inability of the kerr thick disk model to account for the blue wings of the line strengthens our conclusion that the black hole in ngc  3516 should be rotating slowly",
    "in this work we suggest a method which allows us to put bounds on the geometry and kinematics of the line emitting surface of a relativistic accretion disk around a supermassive black hole .",
    "our technique is not sensitive to models of the illuminating source , the distribution of illuminating radiation over the disk surface , or the angular distribution of the reflected line in the rest frame of the reflecting material .",
    "we use our method to determine the positions of the red and blue edges of observed emission lines and extract information from these positions by comparison with the results of a fully relativistic ray - tracing code .",
    "the code generates maps of line - frequency extrema , and it can be used to demonstrate explicitly the differences which can arise as a result of black hole spin and turbulence in an accretion disk .    conventionally , the only way to identify black hole rotation is to find emission from within the innermost stable orbit of a nonrotating black hole .",
    "our method illustrates that if one has information about the geometry of the accretion flow from some other observation such as the inclination angle of a jet , along with an estimate of the luminosity relative to eddington , then a new measure of the hole s",
    "spin may be available . we can thus break the `` degeneracy '' that exists between rotating and nonrotating black holes in a new way .",
    "certainly , our method can not be a substitute for the fitting of the whole shape of the line assuming a particular emissivity law ( power law axisymmetric in most works ) and it can not provide interesting information about the emissivity law itself .",
    "however , it can provide bounds on the geometry of the disk and the angular momentum of the black hole , which any emissivity model should satisfy .",
    "therefore , it is important to emphasize the position of the line edges and to test model parameters obtained as a result of line profile fitting against the constraints provided by our method .",
    "a drawback of the method are uncertainties in the determination of the position of the edges .",
    "a main focus of this paper is to find a reasonable edge detection algorithm to replace the conservative edge - boundary limits found by bromley , miller & pariev ( 1998 ) .",
    "we perform monte - carlo simulations of the data set using fits to the line edges with both a nonlinear sharp - edge model and a polynomial model which makes no a priori assumption about the shape of the line profile .",
    "we find reasonable agreement between models , both in terms of best - fit values and the error distributions .",
    "another drawback of the method is possible contamination with iron k@xmath84 line , nickel k@xmath0 line , @xmath159 and @xmath93 k@xmath0 lines of highly ionized iron .",
    "we made corrections to profiles for the iron k@xmath84 line using a k@xmath84-to - k@xmath0 yield ratio and for the nickel k@xmath0 line using a fiducial yield of @xmath99 relative to iron k@xmath0 ( see george & fabian  1991 ) .",
    "for quality of spectra currently available , these corrections are small .",
    "we illustrate frequency extrema method by applying it to the seyfert galaxies mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , ngc  4151 , and ngc  3516 .",
    "the results for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 show that the commonly assumed inclination angle of @xmath1 for a thin accretion disk is inconsistent with the position of the blue edge of the line at a @xmath2 level .",
    "the thick turbulent disk model can remedy this discrepancy , since it leads to appearance of a smooth blue wing in the line while the changes to the main profile are not so large ( pariev  & bromley , 1998 ) .",
    "recent estimates of the mass of the black hole in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 favor a luminosity ratio @xmath201 , which is enough to account for the @xmath31 for all observations of the iron line in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 published to date .",
    "furthermore , frequency extrema lead us to conclude that the black hole in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 must be rotating with at least @xmath202 .    for ngc  4151 our method excludes face  on and edge  on geometries , while giving bounds for the inclination angle of x - ray emitting inner disk of @xmath3 .",
    "these bounds are consistent with the models of the ionization cone grazing the disk by pedlar et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and two x - ray emitting disks of wang et al .",

    "( 1993 ) based on the observation of the biconical geometry of the narrow line [ o  ]  @xmath1665007 sources . because of very low ratio of @xmath17 , effects of turbulence in this source are negligible .",

    "( 1999 ) favors schwarzschild vs. kerr model for ngc  3516 . although @xmath204 for this source , the determination of the mass of the black hole is very uncertain .",
    "the possibility exists that the thick disk model may be relevant for ngc  3516 and could explain the blue wings of the line , observed during monitoring of this source by nandra et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "further reverberation mapping results will provide better estimates of the mass of the black holes in nearby seyferts and allow the thick turbulent disk model to have more predictive power for each individual source .",

    "<S> the observed iron k@xmath0 fluorescence lines in seyfert   galaxies provide strong evidence for an accretion disk near a supermassive black hole as a source of the emission . here </S>",
    "<S> we present an analysis of the geometrical and kinematic properties of the disk based on the extreme frequency shifts of a line profile as determined by measurable flux in both the red and blue wings . </S>",
    "<S> the edges of the line are insensitive to the distribution of the x - ray flux over the disk , and hence provide a robust alternative to profile fitting of disk parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our approach yields new , strong bounds on the inclination angle of the disk and the location of the emitting region . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our method to interpret observational data from mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and find that the commonly assumed inclination @xmath1 for the accretion disk in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is inconsistent with the position of the blue edge of the line at a @xmath2 level . a thick turbulent disk model or the presence of highly ionized iron may reconcile the bounds on inclination from the line edges with the full line profile fits based on simple , geometrically thin disk models . </S>",
    "<S> the bounds on the innermost radius of disk emission indicate that the black hole in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is rotating faster than 30  % of theoretical maximum . </S>",
    "<S> when applied to data from ngc  4151 , our method gives bounds on the inclination angle of the x - ray emitting inner disk of @xmath3 , consistent with the presence of an ionization cone grazing the disk as proposed by pedlar et al .  </S>",

    "<S> the frequency extrema analysis also provides limits to the innermost disk radius in another seyfert  1 galaxy , ngc  3516 , and is suggestive of a thick disk model . </S>"
