    "their numbers allow them to be used as probes of the formation timescale and chemical enrichment history of the milky way halo , thick disk , and central bulge .",
    "one of the earliest papers to examine the age - metallicity relation ( amr ) of the milky way gc system was @xcite .",
    "they calculated ages for 32 gcs using the magnitude difference between the horizontal branch ( hb ) and the main sequence turnoff ( msto ) .",
    "taking a cue from @xcite , @xcite compared the amr for gcs inside 15 kpc of the galactic center with that of gcs outside 15 kpc .",
    "they found a statistically significant difference between the two : the amr of gcs with galactocentric distance ( @xmath1 ) @xmath7 15 kpc was shallower than that of gcs with @xmath8 15 kpc .",
    "@xcite argued , based on the work of @xcite and @xcite , that the inner halo gcs formed in a region of higher gas and dust density , thereby accelerating gc formation and chemical enrichment .",

    "subsequent work by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite reinforced the results of @xcite and @xcite using larger and more reliable data sets of gc ages as well as a variety of techniques for measuring them .",
    "the most recent studies to determine ages from a large sample of gcs , by @xcite and @xcite , rely upon the uniform photometric data set provided by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) galactic gc treasury project @xcite .",
    "this data set provides deep photometry for 65 gcs of up to @xmath27 magnitudes below the msto @xcite . based on a careful analysis of the ages and metallicities of the galactic gc treasury project gcs , @xcite showed the clearest evidence thus far that the gc amr splits into two distinct branches .",
    "this result was reinforced by @xcite , who added the six most distant ( known ) galactic gcs to the gc treasury data set and used the combined sample to study the correlations between hb morphology and a variety of gc parameters .",
    "the analysis presented by @xcite using data assembled from the literature for 93 gcs largely reinforces these conclusions .",
    "the hst / acs galactic gc treasury project preferentially targeted nearby gcs in order to maximize the depth that could be achieved with one orbit per filter .",
    "one consequence of this strategy is that it left out much of the outer halo .",

    "their conclusion rests on the assumption that the outer halo gcs have similar chemical abundances ( [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath13/fe ] ) to m3 and m5 ; this assumption has since been borne out for palomar  3 @xcite and palomar  4 @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented cmds of palomar  14 ( @xmath14 kpc ) and am-1 ( @xmath15 kpc ) and concluded that both are 1.5 - 2 gyr younger than m3 , in keeping with the results of @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of the present study , the 6 known gcs with r@xmath16 kpc are sufficiently well studied to firmly mark their place in the gc amr .",
    "chemical abundance information remains rather sparse for the most distant gcs , but what is known is consistent with what has been inferred from the cmds .",
    "thus far then , deep and fairly homogeneous hst cmds in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( or equivalent ) filters exist for the majority of gcs with @xmath19 kpc and all those ( known ) beyond 50 kpc , allowing precise and internally consistent ages to be measured .",
    "what remains is to target the gcs within @xmath20 kpc so that the complete radial extent of the galactic gcs , and what it can tell us about the formation of the galaxy , can be probed .",
    "the present study is the first major step toward fulfilling this goal , wherein we present deep , homogeneous hst acs photometry , and use the resulting cmds to estimate the ages , of six outer halo gcs : pyxis , ruprecht  106 , ic  4499 , ngc  6426 , ngc  7006 , and palomar  15 . of the six ,",
    "only ic  4499 has previous hst photometry @xcite , and it is not of sufficient depth to allow an accurate age determination .",
    "in addition , a new age determination for palomar  5 ( @xmath4 kpc ) using archival hst / wfpc2 @xmath5 data from @xcite has been performed and included in the subsequent discussion .",
    "the remainder of this paper proceeds as follows : the observations and data reduction are described in @xmath21 , the cmds are presented in @xmath22 , the available information on the chemical abundances , distances , and reddening values of the sample is reviewed in @xmath23 , new age determinations based on isochrone fitting are presented in @xmath24 , the galactic gc amr is updated and compared with theoretical work in the context of the formation of the galaxy in @xmath25 , @xmath26 provides some discussion of the results , and @xmath27 summarizes the findings presented in the paper .",

    "the lower - right panel of figure [ amr ] compares the gc amr with the mean trend ( squares ) and standard deviation ( indicated by error bars ) of [ fe / h ] for 0.5 gyr age bins of nearly 10,000 simulated gcs drawn from the @xcite model .",
    "while the outer halo gcs are well represented by the mean trend , the model is discrepant with the metal - rich gcs in the inner galaxy , i.e. , the bulge and thick disk gcs .",
    "muratov & gnedin attribute this discrepancy to the lack of a metallicity gradient within the individual merging halos . as a substantial fraction of the galactic gc population",
    "is old and metal - rich , it behooves a model of the gc population formation to describe the origins of these gcs .",
    "the amrs constructed by @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * further updated in this paper ) show that galactic gcs split into two distinct branches at [ fe / h ] @xmath107 .",
    "@xcite interpreted this branching as representing two groups of gcs : an old group with uniformly old ages ( a flat amr ) and a young group with a significant trend toward younger ages at higher metallicities .",
    "they concluded that these groups likely originated from two different phases of galaxy formation : an initial , relatively brief collapse and a second , prolonged episode driven by accretion .",
    "@xcite found a small number of metal - poor ( [ m / h ] @xmath108 ) gcs with somewhat younger ages than the bulk of the metal - poor gcs . @xcite and the present study find all of the metal - poor gcs to be uniformly old , but this difference does not substantially influence the conclusion with respect to the proposed galaxy formation scenario .    a number of influential studies have used the hb morphology - metallicity diagram to infer the ages of stellar populations for which metallicity information and good photometry to at least the level of the hb are available .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite both used synthetic hb models to demonstrate that , under the assumption of constant mass loss , the galactic gc hb morphology - metallicity diagram showed evidence for an age spread of several ( @xmath109 ) gyr for a fixed he content and heavy element distribution .",
    "the use of the hb morphology - metallicity diagram must , however , remain a crude age indicator at best for a variety of reasons . the lack of detailed abundance information , including the possible spread in he within a given gc , has important implications for hb morphology .",
    "the effect of a spread in the total he content on hb morphology _ among _ different gcs has been explored by many authors ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as a spread in he _ within _ single gcs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another important factor in matching gc hb morphology to model predictions is statistical fluctuations .",
    "the acs gc treasury project photometric database contains gcs with anywhere from @xmath110 to several hundred hb stars , leading to uncertainty in the median color of the hb of up to 30% in the sparsest gc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) .    addressing the question of which parameters most strongly influence hb morphology using full cmds for large samples of gcs , @xcite and",
    "@xcite reached the same conclusion : that age is the second parameter influencing hb morphology .",
    "the results presented in this paper lend further support to this conclusion .",
    "it is important to note that the term ` second parameter ' used here applies specifically to the variation of hb morphology _ among _ different gcs , the context in which the term was originally used in the 1960 s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "` second parameter ' is not intended to apply to the spread in hb stars within a single gc , for which the same term is often employed , nor does this paper seek to address that important issue . @xcite and",
    "@xcite both found evidence for at least a third parameter as well , suggesting that age and metallicity alone are not sufficient to fully characterize hb morphology .",
    "figure [ hb ] shows the hb morphology - metallicity diagram of the full sample of 68 gcs .",
    "the left panel considers hb morphology as the median color difference between the hb and rgb @xcite and the right panel instead uses the ( b@xmath58r)/(b+v+r ) metric of @xcite as compiled by @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that these two hb morphology metrics are strongly correlated , with the main difference being that @xmath111 does not saturate as ( b@xmath58r)/(b+v+r ) does at @xmath105 . in this context , it is clear that age is the second parameter influencing hb morphology as concluded by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while figure [ hb ] is not well sampled over the full range of metallicity , it can still be seen that the transition from a red hb to a blue one happens over @xmath112 dex in [ fe / h ] for a fixed age , or @xmath113 gyr at fixed [ fe / h ] .",
    "it is interesting to consider the ensemble in this manner , despite the fact that age uncertainties remain at or near the 10% level .",
    "it is a fortunate coincidence that we observe these gcs at a time when the hb morphology - metallicity diagram is rich with information .",
    "turn the clock back @xmath88 gyr and the hb morphology - metallicity diagram would have been populated only on the red side  as , for example , in the smc @xcite . at such a time , the study by @xcite would have revealed little variation in hb morphology among the halo gcs and , hence , little or no insight into the formation of the galaxy . only the truly peculiar gcs , such as ngc  2808 @xcite , might have shown a sizable variation .",
    "on the other hand , turn the clock forward @xmath88 gyr and all but the most metal - rich galactic gcs would have blue hbs .",
    "hst / acs photometry of 6 galactic halo gcs , ic  4499 , ngc  6426 , ngc  7006 , palomar  15 , pyxis , and ruprecht  106 , were presented .",
    "the resulting cmds were used to derive ages via isochrone fitting .",
    "the age of palomar  5 was derived using the same set of models and the combined photometry of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the ages and metallicities of these 7 gcs were added to the amr of @xcite .",
    "the total number of homogeneously studied gcs in the sample is 68 , excluding those 7 gcs imaged by the acs survey of galactic gcs that are known to harbor multiple , distinct stellar populations .",
    "divided at @xmath114 kpc , the inner galaxy gcs exhibit a pattern of rapid chemical enrichment spanning two orders of magnitude in metallicity over a timescale of 1 - 2 gyr . the outer galaxy gcs exhibit",
    "a much slower chemical enrichment that is evocative of dwarf galaxy chemical evolution and is reasonably well matched by the semi - analytic gc formation models of @xcite .",
