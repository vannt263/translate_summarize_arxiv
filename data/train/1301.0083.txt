    "the first speculation about the existence of a `` field of characteristic one '' can be found in the 1956 paper @xcite by jacques tits .",
    "he observed that certain incidence geometries that come from point ",
    "line configurations in a projective space over a finite field @xmath24 have a combinatorial counterpart when @xmath25 goes to @xmath26 .",
    "this means that there exist _ thin _ incidence geometries that satisfy similar axioms as the _ thick _ geometries that come from projective spaces over @xmath24 .",
    "this picture is compatible with the action of algebraic groups on the thick incidence geometries and of their combinatorial counterparts , the weyl groups , on the thin incidence geometries .",
    "this inspired tits to dream about an explanation of the thin geometries as a geometry over @xmath0 .",
    "all this finds a nice formulation in terms of the group @xmath27 of @xmath24-rational points of a chevalley group @xmath7 that acts on a spherical building @xmath28 .",
    "the limit @xmath29 is the weyl group @xmath6 of @xmath7 that acts on the apartment @xmath30 of @xmath28 .",
    "this has led to the slogan @xmath31 . for more details on this , see @xcite , @xcite and section [ section : buildings ] of this text .",
    "much later , in the early 1990 s , the expected shape of @xmath0-geometry took a more concise form when it was connected to profound number theoretic problems .",
    "though it is hard to say who contributed to which idea in detail , one finds the following traces in the literature .",
    "smirnov describes in @xcite an approach to derive the abc - conjecture from an approximate hurwitz formula for a morphism @xmath32 , for which he gives an ad hoc definition . here",
    "@xmath33 is the _ constant field _ of @xmath3 .",
    "more generally , he considers any _ arithmetic curve @xmath34 _ , i.e.  the arakelov compactification of the spectrum of the algebraic integers in a number field @xmath1 , and conjectures an approximate hurwitz formula for the morphism @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the union of @xmath37 with all @xmath38-th roots of unity of @xmath1 .",
    "around the same time , kapranov and smirnov aim in @xcite to calculate cohomological invariants of arithmetic curves in terms of cohomology over @xmath39 .",
    "the unfinished text contains many concepts that were of influence to the further development of @xmath0-geometry : linear and homological algebra over @xmath39 , distinguished morphisms as cofibrations , fibrations and equivalences ( which might be seen as a first hint of the connections of @xmath0-geometry to homotopy theory ) , arakelov theory _",
    "modulo @xmath38 _ and connections to class field theory and reciprocity laws , which can be seen in analogy to knots and links in @xmath40-space .",
    "see manin s paper @xcite for further explanations on the connection between arithmetic curves and @xmath40-manifolds .",
    "kurokawa ( @xcite ) publishes in 1992 a construction of absolute tensor products of zeta functions of objects of different characteristics .",
    "the underlying assumption is that these objects are all defined over an absolute point , i.e.  @xmath0 . in his 1995 lecture notes",
    "@xcite , manin ties up this viewpoint with deninger s work @xcite , @xcite and @xcite on a conjectural formalism of motives that aims at transferring weil s proof ( @xcite ) of the riemann hypothesis from positive characteristic to the classical case .",
    "this formalism includes a conjectural decomposition @xmath41 of the completed riemann zeta function where the two _ regularized determinants @xmath42 _ of the denominator equal @xmath43 resp .",
    "manin observes that these functions fit kurokawa s formalism if @xmath43 is interpreted as @xmath45 and @xmath44 is interpreted as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the postulated _ absolute tate motive _ , or , following kurokawa s line of thought , the _ affine line _",
    "@xmath48 over the",
    "_ absolute point _ @xmath49 .",
    "the first suggestion of what a _ variety over @xmath0 _ should be was given by soul ( @xcite ) in 2004 .",
    "this paper was of particular importance since it adds the following ideas to @xmath0-geometry .",
    "it contains the definition of the zeta function @xmath50 of an @xmath0-scheme @xmath34 whose @xmath24-rational points @xmath51 can be counted by a polynomial @xmath52 with integral coefficients @xmath53 . a priori , @xmath50 is defined as the inverse of the limit @xmath29 of the zeta function @xmath54 over @xmath24 where one has to multiply by @xmath55 to resolve the pole at @xmath56 .",
    "note that its order @xmath57 might be interpreted as the number of @xmath0-rational points of @xmath34 .",
    "the comparison theorem for singular and @xmath58-adic cohomology and the weil conjectures imply that @xmath57 equals the euler characteristic of @xmath59 if @xmath60 is smooth and projective .",
    "see section [ section : euler cahracteristics and f1-rational points ] of this text for more on the connection between the euler characteristic and @xmath0-rational points .",
    "it turns out that the limit @xmath29 of @xmath61 is the elementary function @xmath62 in particular , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which equals , up to a factor @xmath65 , the motivic zeta functions of deninger , as postulated by manin .",
    "the advantage of this definition is that it depends only on the number of @xmath24-rational points of @xmath34 , but not on the particular theory of @xmath0-varieties , so that this notion of @xmath66-functions applies to every notion of an @xmath0-scheme .",
    "therefore it was possible to investigate zeta functions of @xmath0-schemes in a down to earth manner and largely independent from the development of scheme theory over @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , kurokawa explores , partly in collaborations with others , properties of absolute zeta functions and developed other notions for absolute arithmetics like derivations , modular forms and hochschild cohomology , cf .  his papers @xcite and @xcite and his collaborations @xcite ( with deitmar and koyama ) , @xcite ( with kim and koyama ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( with koyama ) , @xcite ( with ochiai and wakayama ) and @xcite ( with wakayama ) .",
    "other works on absolute zeta functions are connes and consani s paper @xcite , deitmar s paper @xcite , minami s paper @xcite and the author s paper @xcite",
    ". further work on hochschild cohomology appears in betley s paper @xcite .",
    "soul s paper @xcite also contains the hypothetical formula @xmath67 where the first equality is the definition of @xmath1-theory via quillen s + -construction , symbolically applied to the elusive field @xmath0 .",
    "the equality in the middle is derived from tits idea @xmath68 , and therefore @xmath69 the last isomorphism is the barratt - priddy - quillen theorem ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    one might speculate about the psychological impact of this first attempt to define @xmath0-geometry : soon after , a dozen further approaches towards @xmath0 ( and more ) appeared . without keeping the chronological order , we mention them in the following . for a brief introduction into the @xmath0-geometries that appeared until 2009 , see the overview paper @xcite of lpez pea and the author .",
    "soul s definition underwent a number of variations by himself in @xcite and by connes and consani in @xcite and later in @xcite .",
    "the latter notion of an @xmath0-scheme turns out to be in essence the same as a torified scheme as introduced by lpez pea and the author in @xcite in order to produce examples for the @xmath0-varieties considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "deitmar reinterprets in @xcite kato s generalization ( @xcite ) of a toric variety as an @xmath0-scheme .",
    "deitmar introduces the notion of a prime ideal for a monoid , which yields a topological space of a combinatorial flavour together with a structure sheaf in monoids .",
    "deitmar pursues the theory in the papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this category of @xmath0-schemes is minimalistic in the sense that it can be embedded into any other @xmath0-theory . in this sense , toric geometry and",
    "its generalization by kato and deitmar constitutes the very core of @xmath0-geometry .",
    "durov s view on arakelov theory in terms of monads in his comprehensive thesis @xcite produces a notion of @xmath0-schemes .",
    "see fresan s mmoire @xcite for a summary of this theory .",
    "of particular interest is that durov s theory contains a model of @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , haran s definition of a generalized scheme in @xcite yields an @xmath0-geometry with a model for @xmath70 .",
    "haran modifies this approach in @xcite and yields a model for @xmath70 with an interesting self - product @xmath71 over @xmath0 .",
    "further models of @xmath70 are given in takagi s paper @xcite , which is based on his previous work @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and in the author s paper @xcite .",
    "see section [ section : the arithmetic line ] for a description of the latter model of @xmath70 as a locally blueprinted space .",
    "ton and vaqui generalize in @xcite the functorial viewpoint on scheme theory to any closed complete and cocomplete symmetric monoidal category @xmath72 that replaces the category of @xmath73-modules in the case of schemes over a ring @xmath73 .",
    "they call the resulting objects _ schemes relative to @xmath72_. an @xmath0-scheme is a scheme relative to the category of sets , together with the cartesian product . after partial results by marty in @xcite , vezzani shows in @xcite that this notion of an @xmath0-scheme is equivalent to deitmar s .",
    "marty develops smooth morphism for relative schemes in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the author shows that blue schemes can be realized as schemes relative to certain module categories ; for a summary , see section [ subsection : relative schemes after toen and vaquie ] .",
    "borger s work @xcite and @xcite on @xmath5-algebraic geometry yields a notion of an @xmath0-scheme in @xcite .",
    "see section [ subsection : lambda - schemes ] for more details and the connection to blueprints .",
    "lescot develops in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite a geometry associated with idempotent semirings , which he gives the interpretation of an @xmath0-geometry .",
    "see section [ subsubsection : idempotent semirings and sesquiads ] for the connection to blueprints .",
    "connes and consani extend lescot s viewpoint to the context of krasner s hyperrings ( @xcite and @xcite ) , which they promote as a geometry over @xmath0 in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "berkovich introduces a theory of congruence schemes for monoids ( see @xcite ) , which can be seen as an enrichment of deitmar s @xmath0-geometry .",
    "deitmar modifies this approach and applies it to sesquiads , which is a common generalization of rings and monoids .",
    "see section [ subsubsection : idempotent semirings and sesquiads ] for the connection of sesquiads to blueprints and section [ subsection : congruence schemes ] for further remarks on congruence schemes .",
    "the author develops in the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( jointly with lpez pea ) , @xcite and @xcite the theory of blueprints and blue schemes , which will be reviewed in part [ partii ] of this paper .",
    "in the last three years , the number of publications on @xmath0 has more than doubled .",
    "many new ideas were formed and many connections to other fields of mathematics were found and established .",
    "we will give an overview of recent results around @xmath0 .",
    "this overview is probably not exhaustive , but hopefully serves as an impression of the versatility of @xmath0 today .",
    "we illustrate in figure [ figure : applications ] some connections to other fields of mathematics , which can be sorted roughly into the four branches arithmetic , homotopy theory , geometry and combinatorics .",
    "-geometry ]      as explained in the previous sections , there are hopes to approach the riemann hypothesis and the abc - conjecture with @xmath0-geometry . while the former remains unsolved , mochizuki ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) has recently announced a proof of the abc - conjecture .",
    "though it does not seem to be connected to smirnov s idea of a conjectural hurwitz inequality for @xmath74 , it borrows ideas from @xmath0-geometry as occasional remarks ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 3.12.4 ( iv ) ) ) make clear .",
    "the connection of the different models of @xmath70 to arakelov theory is apparent .",
    "however , the algebraically defined vector bundles on @xmath70 come naturally equipped with the @xmath26-norm ( or , dually , with the @xmath75-norm ) at the archimedean places while arakelov geometry considers vector bundles together with the @xmath22-norm .",
    "this digression has not yet been explained in a satisfying way .",
    "we remark that the definition of @xmath70 as a locally blueprinted space in @xcite yields a reinterpretation of the euler factors of the riemann zeta function , including the gamma factor , in terms of integrals over the ideal space of the local blueprints .",
    "there are several connections of @xmath0-geometry to homotopy theory .",
    "the expected isomorphism of the @xmath1-theory of @xmath0 with the stable homotopy of the sphere spectrum has been established .",
    "deitmar defines in @xcite @xmath1-groups for commutative monoids and derives @xmath2 .",
    "this has been generalized by chu and morava ( @xcite ) to non - commutative monoids , with a @xmath7-theory variant by mahanta ( @xcite ) , and by chu , santhanam and the author ( @xcite ) to monoidal schemes .",
    "we review the latter theory in the more general context of blue schemes in section [ section : k - theory ] of this paper .",
    "calculations of vector bundles on @xmath76 , grothendieck groups @xmath77 and hall algebras can be found in @xcite ( von bothmer , hinsch and stuhler ) , @xcite and @xcite ( szczesny ) and the mentioned paper @xcite .",
    "salch gives in @xcite a definition of the bounded below derived category @xmath78 of @xmath0 and shows that this category is equivalent to pointed simplicial sets .",
    "this might be interpreted as the dold - kan correspondence over @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , one can interpret the stable homotopy category as the derived category over @xmath0 .",
    "anevski reconstructs in @xcite the spectrum of @xmath0 from the stable homotopy category .",
    "banerjee applies in @xcite lurie s machinery of derived algebraic geometry ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , et cetera ) to define derived schemes over @xmath0 .",
    "cortias , haesemeyer , mark , walker and weibel extend in @xcite and @xcite the theory of monoidal schemes and apply it to calculate cdh - descent and positive characteristic @xmath1-theory for toric varieties .",
    "this can be seen as a hint of the role of motivic cohomology for the future of @xmath0 .",
    "finally we would like to mention that homotopy theory might be the only way to define a good substitute for sheaf cohomology .",
    "note that deitmar shows in @xcite that the methods of homological algebra extend to @xmath79-modules @xmath80 of an @xmath0-scheme @xmath34 , which yields a definition of cohomology _ sets _ @xmath81 .",
    "a calculation of sheaf cohomology for @xmath82 shows that @xmath83 is infinite - dimensional ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is some hope that ech cohomology produces smaller cohomology groups , but it is also possible that the only path towards ( finite - dimensional ) cohomology passes through homotopy theory .",
    "nowadays , there is a plenitude of highly developed geometric categories that were invented for one or the other reason",
    ". it might be the aim of a larger program to unify these geometries to a theory with common roots .",
    "many signs hint towards homotopy theory , but a reinterpretation in terms of topological spectra comes with the loss of all the algebraic structure that makes `` algebraic geometries '' very manageable and computable . in some special cases ,",
    "much can be seen already from the @xmath0-perspective .",
    "@xmath5-algebraic geometry after borger ( @xcite ) provides its own definition of an @xmath0-scheme .",
    "since a @xmath5-structure of a scheme is thought of as a descend datum to @xmath0 , one might change the viewpoint and impose that the base extension of an @xmath0-scheme should come with a @xmath5-structure .",
    "we exploit this viewpoint in section [ subsection : lambda - schemes ] of this text .",
    "similarly , logarithmic algebraic geometry is concerned with schemes with extra structure , namely , a sheaf of monoids .",
    "it turns out that a log scheme is indeed closely connected to a blue scheme , see section [ subsection : log schemes ] of this text .    following the line of thoughts of manin in @xcite",
    ", there should be a link between @xmath0-schemes and motives that explains the similar structure of their zeta functions .",
    "there are further connections of motives and @xmath0-schemes to non - commutative geometry , see connes , consani and marcolli s papers @xcite and @xcite , bejleri and marcolli s paper @xcite and marcolli s appendix of sujatha and plazas lecture notes @xcite .",
    "another theory of interest is analytic geometry over @xmath0 .",
    "manin describes in @xcite analytic geometry over @xmath0 in terms of habiro rings and connects this to certain power series in @xmath25 whose domains of convergence have a particular behaviour at roots of unity , i.e.  over @xmath39 .",
    "it is further expected that analytic geometry over @xmath0 connects to analytic geometry after berkovich ( @xcite and @xcite ) and huber ( @xcite ) and to tropical geometry ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", berkovich defines in @xcite congruence schemes for monoids in order to explain skeletons of berkovich spaces .",
    "since the monoids that appear in berkovich s theory are the underlying monoids of idempotent semirings and since tropical schemes are also defined in terms of idempotent semirings ( see mikhalkin s unpublished notes @xcite ) , it is desirable to extend the notion of congruence schemes to semirings .",
    "there is hope for a theory of congruence schemes for blueprints , which contains the special cases of monoids with zero ( berkovich ) , sesquiads ( deitmar ) and semirings .",
    "see section [ subsection : congruence schemes ] for more explanations on this .",
    "it seems that blueprints match and generalize paugam s approach to global analytic geometry in @xcite , which yields a conceptual explanation of berkovich spaces and huber s adic spaces .",
    "therefore one might hope for a functorial connection between analytic spaces over @xmath0 on one side and berkovich spaces , adic spaces and tropical schemes on the other side .",
    "the combinatorial flavour of @xmath0-geometry gives access to geometric explanations of combinatorial phenomena , and this might be used to develop computational methods for usual algebraic geometry .",
    "tits idea of chevalley groups over @xmath0 and the formula @xmath31 found numerous remarks in the literature on @xmath0 , and this formula seemed to make sense from many viewpoints ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "for the reason explained in the beginning of this text , it was not possible to combine the formula @xmath31 with a theory of group schemes over @xmath0 . in @xcite ,",
    "the author describes a theory of group schemes that circumvents the problem by considering two classes of morphisms .",
    "the longing for a more conceptual understanding of @xmath0-models of chevalley groups gave birth to the notion of a blueprint and the theory of blue schemes ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "see part [ partii ] and , in particular , section [ section : chevalley groups over fun ] for a description of this theory .",
    "there are also some remarks on incidence geometries that come from @xmath0-schemes , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it turns out that apartments of buildings ( and other incidence geometries ) are naturally attached to representations of chevalley groups over @xmath0 on projective space .",
    "a description of this is given in section [ section : buildings ] of this text .",
    "the hope to calculate cohomological invariants of schemes depends largely on the existence of a ( well - behaved ) @xmath0-model .",
    "reineke proves in @xcite that every projective variety can be realized as a quiver grassmannian .",
    "szczesny defines in @xcite quiver representations over @xmath0 , which leads to the notion of @xmath0-rational points of a quiver grassmannian @xmath84 .",
    "while this viewpoint might be too restrictive , the data attached to a quiver grassmannian can be used to define an @xmath0-model @xmath85 in the language of blue schemes . in certain cases ,",
    "the euler characteristics of @xmath84 can be computed by counting certain points of @xmath85 .",
    "see section [ section : euler cahracteristics and f1-rational points ] for more explanations .",
    "finally , we would like to mention the following conjecture of reineke in @xcite .",
    "reineke shows that moduli spaces @xmath34 of quiver representations have a counting polynomial @xmath86 .",
    "conjecture 8.5 in @xcite is that the coefficients @xmath87 of @xmath88 are non - negative .",
    "this might be proven by finding a suitable @xmath0-model for the moduli space @xmath34 .",
    "in this second part , we introduce blueprints and blue schemes , and we describe some of their applications . to make this text accessible to the non - expert , we include the basic definitions and aim for a non - technical and partly simplified presentation .",
    "a blueprint can be seen as a multiplicatively closed subset @xmath89 ( with @xmath37 and @xmath26 ) of a semiring @xmath73 .",
    "the addition of the semiring allows us to express relations @xmath90 between sums of elements @xmath53 and @xmath91 of @xmath89 . in the extreme case @xmath92 ,",
    "the blueprint is a semiring , and in the other extreme case @xmath93 where @xmath94/(0)$ ] is the semigroup ring of @xmath89 ( with the zeros of @xmath89 and @xmath73 identified ) , the blueprint behaves like a multiplicative monoid .",
    "its geometric counterpart , the notion of a blue scheme , includes monoidal schemes and usual schemes as subclasses . beyond these well - known objects , it contains also a class of semiring schemes as well as @xmath0-models for all schemes of finite type .",
    "this makes the category of blue schemes flexible enough to treat several problems of @xmath0-geometry .",
    "we review the basic definitions in the section [ section : definitions ] .",
    "the theory behaves largely in complete analogy with usual scheme theory .",
    "the only new aspect is that the presheaf of localizations of a blueprint is not a sheaf on the prime spectrum of the blueprint .",
    "the required sheafification leads to an equivalence between affine blue schemes with the proper subclass of so - called global blueprints .",
    "once aware of this phenomenon , one can proceed with developing properties of scheme theory , such as a locally algebraic characterization of morphisms or fibre products .",
    "we conclude section [ section : definitions ] with a description of the @xmath95-functor for graded blueprints and projective varieties . in the following sections , we review and preview a number of application of blueprints to @xmath0-geometry .",
    "we list references for the results in this exposition below .      while monoidal schemes and , more generally , blue schemes reflect naturally the combinatorical structures that are expected in @xmath0-geometry , morphisms of monoidal resp .",
    "blue schemes are not suited to capture group laws or to relate to the predicted sets of @xmath0-rational points . in section [ section : chevalley groups over fun ] , we explain the notion of the rank space , which reflects the set of @xmath0-rational points together with an intrinsic schematic structure .",
    "this leads to the class of tits morphisms , which is flexible enough to descend group laws and group actions to @xmath0 and whose close relation to the rank space yields the expected set of @xmath0-rational points in a functorial way .    in section [",
    "section : chevalley groups over fun ] , we briefly review the notion of a tits - weyl model and apply it to split reductive groups and to their parabolic and levi subgroups . in section",
    "[ section : buildings ] , we explain how coxeter complexes and buildings together with the usual group actions appear naturally in terms of representations of tits - weyl models . in section [ section : euler cahracteristics and f1-rational points ] , we establish for a certain class of integral varieties the connection between the complex euler characteristic and the number of @xmath0-rational points .",
    "arakelov theory gives a clear expectation of how the compactification of @xmath3 should look like , but the obstacle that the stalk at infinity @xmath96 is not a ring requires an extension of scheme theory to make sense of the arithmetic curve @xmath70 . in section [ section : the arithmetic line ] , we will use blueprints to define candidates for @xmath70 and , more generally , for @xmath97 where @xmath98 denoted a ring of integers in a number field @xmath1 .",
