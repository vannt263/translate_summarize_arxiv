    "the two - user interference channel , which is the smallest multiple source - destination pair communication channel with interference , has received a great deal of attention . however , single - letter capacity expressions for discrete memoryless and gaussian interference channels are still unknown in general and known only for some limited cases . for strong @xcite and very strong @xcite interference channels , the capacity region is known in general .",
    "recently , the sum - rate capacity for the very weak ic @xcite has been discovered based on genie - aided outer bounding . motivated by the sum - rate capacity for the very weak ic , the capacity region for general gaussian interference channel is characterized to within one bit in  @xcite .",
    "recently , many people have focused on the interference relay channel , which is an interference channel with a relay helping the communication . for the interference relay channel",
    "where the relay s transmit signal can be heard from only one source , the capacity is known under a certain condition using an interference forwarding scheme @xcite .",
    "rate splitting and decode - and - forward relaying approach is considered in @xcite , showing that transmitting the common message only at the relay achieves the maximum achievable sum rate for symmetric gaussian interference relay channels . for a gaussian interference channel with a cognitive relay having access to the messages transmitted by both sources , @xcite proposed a new achievable rate region .    in network information theory , it is typically assumed that the relay s transmit symbol depends only on its past received symbols",
    ". however , sometimes it makes more sense to assume that the relay s current transmit symbol depends also on its current received symbol , which is a better model for studying af type relaying if the overall delay spread including the path through the relay is much smaller than the inverse of the bandwidth .",
    "this channel has recently received attention  @xcite .",
    "relay - without - delay channel is a single source - destination pair communication system with a relay helping the communication such that it encodes its transmit symbol not only based on its past received symbols but also on the current received symbol . for the gaussian relay - without - delay channel , instantaneous amplify - and - forward relaying achieves the capacity if the relay s transmit power is greater than a certain threshold  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider interference relay - without - delay channel where two source nodes want to transmit messages to their respective destination nodes and a relay without delay helps their communication .",

    "we also propose an achievable scheme using gaussian codebooks , simultaneous non - unique decoding , and instantaneous amplify - and - forward relaying .",
    "the complexity of the proposed relaying is very low compared to other more complicated relaying schemes including decode - and - forward and compress - and - forward since it only has symbolwise operations . despite its simplicity , we show that it can achieve the capacity exactly when the relay s transmit power is greater than a certain threshold for the very strong case . for the strong case ,",
    "the same is true if some additional conditions are satisfied .",
    "this is surprising since it means that such a simple symbolwise relaying can be optimal in a complicated communication scenario where there are two source - destination pairs interfering with each other .",

    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the discrete memoryless interference relay - without - delay channel model and derive an outer bound . in section 3 , we define strong and very strong gaussian interference relay - without - delay channel and propose outer bounds for each case .",
    "we propose an achievable scheme based on instantaneous amplify - and - forward relaying and show that this achievable scheme achieves the capacity for strong and very strong gaussian interference relay - without - delay channels under certain conditions . to show the existence of strong and very strong gaussian interference relay - without - delay channels , we provide some examples .",
