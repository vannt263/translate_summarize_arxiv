    "one example is the onset of superconductivity in bcs superconductors where a specific heat jump @xmath11@xmath12  appears at @xmath12  ( @xmath13 is the sommerfeld coefficient ) .",
    "well below @xmath12 , the specific heat gives direct access to the entropy of cooper - pair breaking and in bcs superconductors it exponentially depends on the isotropic gap @xmath14 . to be more general , the specific heat measures the gap magnitude and structure and provides information on the pairing mechanism .",
    "noteworthy , being a thermodynamic quantity the specific heat is sensitive to bulk properties which is in contrast to rather surface - sensitive methods such as arpes or stm .    in this work",
    ", a commercially available device is applied for specific heat measurements of the unconventional superconductor k@xmath0na@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the data imply a large @xmath4-contribution to the specific heat well below @xmath12  thereby evidencing @xmath5-wave superconductivity in this material .",
    "the calibration of the calorimeter by measurements of high purity ag however indicates a strong schottky - like increase of the addenda heat capacity which increases systematic errors below @xmath15 . in order to study materials with small heat capacity ,",
    "i.e. with very small sample mass and/or low specific heat , the design of a novel calorimeter is presented .",
    "the proposed calorimeter with paramagnetic temperature sensor and a squid - based readout is expected to have a much smaller addenda heat capacity of less than @xmath7 for @xmath16 and promises a temperature resolution of @xmath6 .",
    "k@xmath0na@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  single crystals were grown using kas - flux described in ref .",
    "a single crystal with mass @xmath17 was placed on a commercial calorimeter ( heat capacity puck qd - p107h ) from quantum design @xcite .",
    "apiezon n grease  @xcite ( typically less than @xmath18 ) served as an adhesive between the sample and the measuring platform .",
    "this platform consists of a @xmath19 sapphire single crystal borne by kapton strips . two ruthenium oxide thick film resistors ( ruox resistors ) attached to the sapphire platform",
    "serve as heater ( with resistance @xmath20 ) and thermometer ( @xmath21 ) .",

    "both resistors are electrically contacted via pt92w8-wires , which also define the thermal link between addenda and thermal bath .",
    "the calorimeter is mounted to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator . for calibration purposes ,",
    "the ruox resistors temperature dependencies @xmath20 and @xmath21 were measured by a standard 4-wire sensing method using an avs-47 ac resistance bridge . for the measurement of the heat capacity we applied a standard pulse - fitting method as described in literature @xcite .",
    "heating power for the pulses is supplied using the analog voltage output of the data acquisition hardware ni - usb 6251 box from national instruments  @xcite connected in series with a @xmath22-resistance .",
    "a lock - in amplifier ( signal recovery 7265 dsp ) performing ac 4-wire sensing in the low @xmath23-range is used to measure the temperature response with desired resolution both in time and amplitude . to suppress parasitic heating ,",

    "magnetic susceptibility measurements in a commercial squid magnetometer ( quantumdesign mpms - xl5  @xcite ) revealed no detectable magnetic impurities in the temperature range @xmath30 that might contribute to the specific heat of this sample . from theoretical calculations one derives the electronic specific heat of silver  @xcite . the debye coefficient is derived from the debye temperature from ref .",

    "although @xmath44-pairing has been suggested for the entire class of fe - based superconductors ( e.g. , ref .",

    "note , that the lattice contribution was defined from the normal state behaviour ( for details see the supplement of ref .",

    "the device discussed so far has limitations at temperatures below @xmath66 .",
    "firstly , the observed schottky - contribution to the addenda heat capacity yields a lower limit to the resolution of the obtained specific heat .",
    "secondly , in order to avoid self - heating only low voltages can be applied to the ruox thermometer resulting in a nonsatisfying temperature resolution .",
    "a third problem arises when the @xmath27 effect @xcite becomes increasingly dominant at low temperatures .",
    "the model applied for data analysis assumes a temperature - independent thermal link @xmath67 during each heat pulse .",
    "however , this precondition is not met anymore when , due to a large @xmath27 effect , the sample platform temperature difference between the heating and cooling process is too large . to address these issues , a calorimeter with paramagnetic temperature sensor and squid - based readout is suggested as shown in figs .",
    "[ heatcapchip ] and [ meander_scheme ] .",
    "paramagnetic metallic sensors are well established low - temperature thermometers for micro - calorimeters ( see ref .",
    "these devices have been developed and utilized for high resolution particle detection .",
    "basic elements of magnetic calorimetry - based detectors are absorbers for the particles and paramagnetic sensors made of er - doped au ( * au*:er ) whose magnetisation obeys a curie - like behaviour . in a small magnetic field , the magnetisation strongly depends on temperature .",
    "temperature changes due to absorption of particles can be detected by a highly sensitive squid - based read - out .",
    "the details of the underlying physics of the sensor material and the detection scheme have been investigated thoroughly in the last decade  @xcite .",

    "[ heatcapchip ] features a * au*:er - sensor with an internal signal rise time as fast as @xmath68 at @xmath69 @xcite as a central element .",
    "the samples will be placed on a @xmath70 thin gold layer ( sample platform ) with a usable area of @xmath71 micro - fabricated on a sapphire substrate ( @xmath72 ) . a aupd film resistor ( c in fig .  [ heatcapchip ] ) placed on the sapphire",
    "is used to generate a heat pulse .",
    "the heater is in electronic contact with the sample platform ( d ) to allow for fast heat flow .",
    "the gold layer may also be used to attach samples via ultrasonic bonding rather than apiezon n grease .",
    "this will strongly decrease the undesired @xmath27 effect .",
    "thermal equilibration is achieved via au bonds between the sample platform and the thermal bath . by varying the number of au bonds",
    ", we can adjust the thermal link @xmath67 depending on the expected heat capacity of the sample under investigation .    to detect the temperature response of a heat pulse , the sample platform",
    "is electronically coupled to the sensor material ( a ) of the thermometer .",
    "this sensor material is placed in a small magnetic field produced by a persistent current in meandering superconducting coils ( b and underneath a ) with inductance @xmath73 . together with the input coil of a dc squid , these coils form a superconducting flux transformer .",
    "the temperature read - out scheme is depicted in fig .",
    "[ meander_scheme ] .",
    "the squid itself is placed next to the calorimeter chip and the coils are connected via superconducting niobium bonds .",
    "a gradiometric read out scheme of the paramagnetic temperature sensor is employed in order to minimize signal fluctuations caused by external magnetic disturbances .",
    "based on experience with cryogenic particle detectors  @xcite , thermodynamic properties of the presented setup including the specific heat and the magnetisation of the sensor material can be predicted reliably using numerical methods .",
    "assuming typical values for the persistent current ( @xmath74 ) and the doping level of er ( @xmath75 ) , the contribution of the sensor material * au*:er  to the addenda heat capacity is estimated to be @xmath76 in the temperatures range @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , the sample platform has an electronic specific heat of @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "other specific heat contributions can be neglected due to the small amount of material used ( aupd ) or their small intrinsic heat capacities ( nb , phonons in the sapphire substrate ) . in total",
    ", we expect a 40-fold smaller addenda heat capacity compared to the discussed commercial device .",
    "the temperature resolution of the new calorimeter can be predicted taking into account geometric factors ( sensor volume @xmath79 , meander - pitch @xmath80 ) , the circuitry of the meanders and squid performance parameters . with the presented design",
    "we expect a temperature resolution of @xmath81 with an integration time of several  @xmath82 , which is far better and faster than the ruox resistance thermometer of the presently used commercial device .",
    "a commercially available calorimeter was calibrated and used for specific heat studies of k@xmath0na@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  down to 20mk in a dilution refrigerator .",
