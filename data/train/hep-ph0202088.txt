    "the principle of factorization underlies all theoretical predictions for hadronic processes .",
    "simply put , factorization is the statement that short and long distances contributions to physical processes can be separated , up to corrections suppressed by powers of the relevant large scale in the process .",
    "the predictive power gained from this result stems from the fact that the incalculable long distance effects are universal , defined in an unambiguous way in terms of matrix elements . as a consequence",
    ", the non - perturbative long distance effects can be extracted in one process and then used in another . in general , proving factorization is a difficult task  @xcite .",
    "the proof of factorization in drell yan processes , for instance , took several years to sort out  @xcite ( for reviews on factorization see  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , there are still some processes such as @xmath7 where a proof of factorization only exists at one - loop  @xcite .    given that we would like to retain our predictive power over the largest possible range of energies",
    ", we are compelled to understand power corrections to the factorized rates .",
    "these corrections are not necessarily universal , and as such , the relevant size of the power corrections are process dependent . in processes",
    "for which there exists an operator product expansion ( ope ) , there is a systematic way in which to include power corrections .",
    "however , for a majority of observables we do not have an ope at our disposal , and the nature of the power correction is not always known .",
    "for instance , in the case of shape variables there is still some on going discussion about the form of subleading corrections  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that an effective theory framework can be used to simplify proofs of factorization and describe processes with an operator formalism . to do this",
    "we extend the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , to high energy processes .",
    "it should be emphasized that there are several other useful advantages in using an effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "for instance , the eft makes any symmetries which emerge in the @xmath8 limit manifest in the lagrangian and operators , and allow statements to be made to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the calculation of hard coefficients reduces to simple matching calculations , where subtracting the eft graphs automatically removes all infrared divergences from the qcd calculation .",
    "perhaps most importantly , it provides a framework for systematically investigating power corrections .",
    "finally , the eft framework allows standard renormalization group techniques to be used for the resummation of logarithms that are often necessary in calculating rates for certain high energy scattering events  @xcite .",
    "the factorization formulae that we prove in this paper are not new , but serve to illustrate our approach in familiar settings .",
    "the results are valid to all orders in @xmath9 and leading order in the power expansion .",
    "the simplicity of our approach lies in the fact that factorization occurs at the level of the scet lagrangian and operators , and is facilitated by gauge symmetry in the eft .",
    "this provides the advantage that our proofs do not rely on making use of ward identities and induction , or on specifying a particular gauge .",
    "furthermore , it becomes rather simple to derive factorization formulae for a myriad of processes , since many results are universal .",
    "the examples given here serve to illustrate these simplifications .",
    "developments on the issues of power corrections and resummations are left to future publications .    in section  [ section_effective ]",
    "we review the construction of the scet .",
    "the formalism developed in refs .",
    "@xcite is extended to include two types of collinear particles moving in opposite directions in section  [ section_nnbar ] , and factorization for @xmath10 to two collinear states is discussed as an example . in section  [ section_melt ]",
    "we define the non - perturbative matrix elements such as the parton distribution functions that will be needed for the processes presented in the paper , and in section  [ section_symm ] we discuss some of the symmetries in scet that may be used to place restrictions on matrix elements . in the remaining sections we give various examples on how factorization theorems emerge in the effective theory language . in section  [ section_exclusive ]",
    "we prove factorization theorems for two exclusive processes , namely the @xmath0-@xmath1 form factor , and meson form factors ( @xmath3 ) for arbitrary spin and isospin structure . in section  [ section_inclusive ]",
    "two inclusive processes are treated , namely dis ( @xmath4 ) and drell - yan ( @xmath11 ) , and we also give results for deeply virtual compton scattering ( @xmath12 ) . in these processes",
    "we include all leading power contributions in the factorization proofs ( even if the operators are only matched onto at higher orders in perturbation theory such as for the gluon distribution functions ) .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  [ section_conclusion ] . in appendix  [ app_fact ]",
    "we show how auxiliary fields can be used to prove the simultaneous factorization of soft fields from collinear fields for particles in back - to - back directions .",
    "effective field theories provide a simple and elegant way of organizing physics in processes containing widely disparate energy scales . in constructing an eft ,",
    "some degrees of freedom are eliminated , and the remaining degrees of freedom must reproduce all the infrared physics of the full theory in the domain where the eft is valid . the eft is organized by an expansion in @xmath13 , defined as the ratio of small to large energy scales . as a useful guideline",
    "the following steps are used to identify the infrared degrees of freedom : 1 ) determine the relevant scales in a problem from the size of the momenta and masses of all particles that can make up the initial and final states , 2 ) construct all momenta from these scales whose components correspond to propagating degrees of freedom , and which have offshellness less than the large scale , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "effective theory fields are then constructed for each unique set of these momenta .",
    "we will be interested in an eft with particles of energy @xmath15 much greater than their mass .",
    "the dynamics of these particles can be described by constructing a soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) .",
    "this theory is organized as an expansion in powers of @xmath16 , and offshell fluctuations with @xmath17 are integrated out . in section  [ section_scet ]",
    "we begin by describing this procedure and comparing the construction to other eft s .",
    "we then give a brief review of the soft - collinear effective theory developed in refs .",
    "we do not attempt to give a comprehensive treatment , but instead emphasize the main results and refer the reader to the literature for details . in section [ section_nnbar ]",
    "we extend the formulation of scet to describe processes with collinear particles moving in back to back directions , and prove the factorization formula for @xmath10 to two collinear states as an example . in section [ section_melt ]",
    "we define the non - perturbative matrix elements that are needed for our examples , then in section  [ section_symm ] we discuss some of the symmetry properties of collinear fields and currents .      in the standard construction of an eft",
    "one removes the short distance scales and massive fields by integrating them out one at a time .",
    "a classical example is integrating out the @xmath18 boson to obtain the effective electroweak hamiltonian with 4-fermion operators .",
    "however , in some situations we are interested in integrating out large momentum fluctuations without fully removing the corresponding field .",
    "the simplest example of this is heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite , which is constructed to describe the low energy properties of mesons with a heavy quark . here",
    "the heavy anti - quarks are integrated out and only heavy quarks with fluctuations close to their mass - shell are retained .",
    "this is accomplished by removing fluctuations of order the heavy quark mass @xmath19 with a field redefinition@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the heavy quark velocity and @xmath22 is the field in the eft . while @xmath23 , the effective field has @xmath24 , indicating that it no longer describes short - distance fluctuations about the perturbative scale @xmath19 .",
    "instead these effects are encoded in calculable wilson coefficients .",
    "the hqet degrees of freedom with offshellness @xmath25 are the heavy quarks , soft gluons , and soft quarks .",
    "similarly , for collinear particles with energy @xmath26 , one needs to remove momentum fluctuations @xmath27 while retaining effective theory fields to describe smaller momenta .",
    "however , unlike heavy quarks the collinear particles have two low energy scales .",
    "consider the light - cone momenta , @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 parameterizes a light - cone direction close to that of the collinear particle and @xmath33 the opposite direction ( eg . for motion in the @xmath34 direction @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) . for a particle of mass @xmath37",
    ", we have @xmath38 , and a small parameter @xmath39 .",
    "the scaling of the @xmath40 component is then fixed by the equations of motion @xmath41 , so that @xmath42 .",
    "the appearance of two small scales , @xmath43 , is similar to the situation in non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) , which is an eft for systems of two heavy quarks with an expansion in their relative velocity @xmath44 . in a non - relativistic bound state",
    "the momentum of a heavy quark is @xmath45 , but the equations of motion @xmath46 make the energy @xmath47 , giving scales @xmath48 .",
    "the two low energy scales can be distinguished by following eq .",
    "( [ fd1 ] ) with a further field redefinition  @xcite @xmath49 , so that derivatives on @xmath50 only pick out the @xmath51 scale .",
    "the on - shell degrees of freedom are then the heavy quarks , soft quarks and gluons with @xmath52 , and ultrasoft quarks and gluons with @xmath53 .    * * + for collinear particles the analogous field redefinitions are  @xcite @xmath54 where the collinear fields @xmath55 are labelled by light - cone vectors @xmath32 and label momentum @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath56 contains the @xmath57 and @xmath58 momenta so that @xmath59 .",
    "the field @xmath60 can either be a quark or gluon field .",
    "similar to @xmath50 , the missing @xmath61 fluctuations are described by wilson coefficients and the @xmath62 labels simplify the power counting by distinguishing the @xmath63 and @xmath64 scales .",
    "now @xmath65 so collinear particles and antiparticles are contained in the same effective theory field , but have momentum labels with the opposite sign . in the large energy limit",
    "the four component fermion spinors contain two large and two small components .",
    "one therefore defines collinear quark fields @xmath66 which only retain the large components for motion in the @xmath32 direction and satisfies @xmath67 . for these fields",
    "@xmath68 destroy / create the particles / antiparticles with large momentum @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "for collinear gluons @xmath70 , and @xmath71/@xmath72 destroy / create gluons with @xmath73 .    for simplicity we will ignore quark masses and only consider massless @xmath74 and @xmath75 quarks . for the processes considered here scet then requires three types of degrees of freedom : collinear , soft , and ultrasoft ( usoft ) fields .",
    "these are distinguished by the scaling of the light cone components ( @xmath40,@xmath76,@xmath77 ) of their momenta : @xmath78 for collinear modes in the @xmath32 direction ( @xmath79 , @xmath66 ) , @xmath80 for the soft modes ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) , and @xmath83 for the usoft modes ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) .",
    "the soft modes are labelled by their order @xmath63 momenta , so @xmath81 and @xmath82 are essentially just momentum space fields .",
    "the usoft fields have no labels and depend only on the coordinate @xmath86 .",
    "the fields are assigned a scaling with @xmath13 to make the action for their kinetic terms order @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "for instance @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 . at leading order only order @xmath87 vertices are necessary to correctly account for all order @xmath87 feynman diagrams",
    ".    in hqet only external currents with momenta of order @xmath92 can change the label @xmath21 .",
    "thus the lagrangian has a superselection rule forbidding changes in the four - velocity of the heavy quark  @xcite . in nrqcd the @xmath21 labels are also conserved , but the smaller momentum labels @xmath93 are changed by operators in the effective theory such as the coulomb potential .",
    "a novel feature of scet is that interactions in the leading action can change both the large and small parts of the momentum labels @xmath94 .",
    "however , only external currents can change the direction @xmath32 of a collinear particle , so this label is conserved .",
    "thus , for each distinct direction @xmath32 a separate set of collinear fields are needed . in the remainder of this section",
    "we will restrict ourselves to collinear particles with a single @xmath32 .",
    "we will generalize the discussion to the case of two back - to - back directions and discuss the factorization of collinear particles with different @xmath32 s in section  [ section_nnbar ] .    since in scet interactions can change the order @xmath15 label momenta it turns out to be very useful to introduce a label operator , @xmath95  @xcite , for which the collinear fields satisfy @xmath96 .",
    "more generally , @xmath95 acts on a product of labelled fields as @xmath97 so conjugate field labels come with a minus sign .",
    "the operator @xmath98 acts to the right , while the conjugate operator @xmath99 acts to the left . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite the label operator allows all large phases to be moved to the front of operators with a factor @xmath100 .",
    "this phase and the label sums can then be suppressed if we impose that interactions conserve label momenta and that the momentum indices on fields are implicitly summed over . basically , for labels @xmath56 and @xmath101 and residual momenta @xmath102 and @xmath103 @xmath104 so that the label and residual momenta are individually conserved .",
    "( although technically the label momenta are discrete we abuse notation and use @xmath105 rather than @xmath106 because it makes the subscripts easier to read . ) for convenience we define the operator @xmath107 to pick out only the order @xmath87 labels on collinear fields , and the operator @xmath108 to pick out only the order @xmath13 labels . for the matrix element of any collinear operator @xmath109 , momentum conservation constrains the sum of field labels  @xcite , giving @xmath110       \\big| m_{n , p_2}\\big\\rangle     & = & f({{\\bar",

    "<S> in this paper we show how gauge symmetries in an effective theory can be used to simplify proofs of factorization formulae in highly energetic hadronic processes . </S>",
