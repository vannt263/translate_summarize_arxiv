    "the question of first - cause has been troubling to philosophers and scientists alike for over two thousand years .",
    "aristotle found this sufficiently troubling that he proposed avoiding it by having the universe exist eternally in both the past and future .",
    "that way , it was always present and one would not have to ask what caused it to come into being .",
    "this type of model has been attractive to modern scientists as well .",
    "when einstein developed general relativity and applied it to cosmology , his first cosmological model was the einstein static universe , which had a static @xmath1 spatial geometry which lasted forever , having no beginning and no end @xcite .    as we shall discuss , since the big bang model s success , models with a finite beginning have taken precedence , even when inflation and quantum tunneling are included .",
    "so the problem of first - cause reasserts itself .",
    "the big question appears to be how to create the universe out of nothing . in this paper",
    "we shall explore the idea that this is the wrong question .",
    "a remarkable property of general relativity is that it allows solutions that have closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) @xcite ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "often , the beginning of the universe , as in vilenkin s tunneling model @xcite and hartle and hawking s no - boundary model @xcite , is pictured as being like the south pole of the earth and it is usually said that asking what happened before that is like asking what is south of the south pole @xcite .",
    "but , suppose the early universe contains a region of ctcs .",
    "then , asking what was the earliest point might be like asking what is the easternmost point on the earth .",
    "you can keep going east around and around the earth  there is no eastern - most point .",
    "in such a model every event in the early universe would have events that preceded it .",
    "this period of ctcs could well have ended by now , being bounded by a cauchy horizon .",
    "some initial calculations of vacuum polarization in spacetimes with ctcs indicated that the renormalized energy - momentum tensor diverged at the cauchy horizon separating the region with ctcs from the region without closed causal curves , or at the polarized hypersurfaces nested inside the cauchy horizon @xcite .",
    "some of these results motivated hawking @xcite to propose the chronology protection conjecture which states that the laws of physics do not allow the appearance of ctcs .",
    "but , a number of people have challenged the chronology protection conjecture by giving counter - examples @xcite . in particular , li and",
    "gott @xcite have recently found that there is a self - consistent vacuum in misner space for which the renormalized energy - momentum tensor of vacuum polarization is zero everywhere .",
    "( cassidy @xcite has independently given an existence proof that there should be a quantum state for a conformally coupled scalar field in misner space , for which the renormalized energy - momentum tensor is zero everywhere , but he has not shown what state it should be .",
    "li and gott @xcite have found that it is the `` adapted '' rindler vacuum . ) in this paper we give some examples to show how it is possible in principle to find self - consistent vacuum states where the renormalized energy - momentum tensor does not blow up as one approaches the cauchy horizon .",
    "to produce such a region of ctcs , the universe must , at some later time , be able to reproduce conditions as they were earlier , so that a multiply connected solution is possible .",
    "interestingly , inflation is well suited to this . a little piece of inflationary state expands to produce a large volume of inflationary state , little pieces of which resemble the starting piece .",
    "also there is the possibility of forming baby universes at late times where new pieces of inflating states are formed .",
    "farhi , guth , and guven @xcite , harrison @xcite , smolin @xcite , and garriga and vilenkin @xcite have considered such models .",
    "if one of those later inflating pieces simply turns out to be the inflating piece that one started out with , then the universe can be its own mother .",
    "since an infinite number of baby universes are created , as long as the probability of a particular multiple connection forming is not exactly zero , then such a connection might be expected , eventually .",
    "then the universe neither tunneled from nothing , nor arose from a singularity ; it created itself ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) .    before discussing this approach to the first - cause problem ,",
    "let us review just how troublesome this problem has been .",
    "as we have noted , einstein @xcite initially tried to avoid it by siding with aristotle in proposing a model which had an infinite past and future .",
    "the einstein static universe appears to be the geometry einstein found _ a priori _ most aesthetically appealing , thus presumably he started with this preferred geometry and substituted it into the field equations to determine the energy - momentum tensor required to produce it .",
    "he found a source term that looks like dust ( stars ) plus a term that was proportional to the metric which he called the cosmological constant .",
    "the cosmological constant , because of its homogeneous large negative pressure , exerts a repulsive gravitational effect offsetting the attraction of the stars for each other ; allowing a static model which could exist ( ignoring instabilities , which he failed to consider ) to the infinite past and future .",
    "if one did not require a static model , there would be no need for the cosmological constant .",
    "friedmann @xcite calculated models without it , of positive , negative or zero curvature , all of which were dynamical .",
    "when hubble @xcite discovered the expansion of the universe , einstein pronounced the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life .",
    "but now there was a problem : all three friedmann models ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) that were expanding at the present epoch had a beginning in the finite past ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the friedmann models the universe began in a singularly dense state at a finite time in the past .",
    "the equations could not be pushed beyond that finite beginning singularity .",
    "furthermore , if today s hubble constant is @xmath5 , then all of the friedmann models had ages less than @xmath6 .",
    "the universe thus began in a big bang explosion only a short time ago , a time which could be measured in billions of years .",
    "the universe was not infinitely old .",
    "gamow @xcite and his colleagues alpher and herman @xcite calculated the evolution of such a big bang cosmology , concluding correctly that in its early phases it should have been very dense and very hot , and that the thermal radiation present in the early universe should still be visible today as microwave radiation with a temperature of approximately @xmath7 .",
    "penzias and wilson s discovery of the radiation with a temperature of @xmath8 @xcite cinched the case for the big bang model .",
    "the cobe results which have shown a beautifully thermal spectrum @xcite and small fluctuations in the temperature @xmath9 @xcite , fluctuations that are of approximately the right magnitude to grow into the galaxies and clusters of galaxies that we see at the present epoch , have served to make the big bang model even more certain . with the big bang model in ascendancy",
    ", attention focused on the initial singularity . hawking and penrose proved a number of singularity theorems @xcite showing that , with some reasonable constraints on the energy - momentum tensor , if einstein s equations are correct and the expansion of the universe is as observed today , there is no way to avoid an initial singularity in the model ; that is , initial singularities would form even in models that were not exactly uniform .",
    "so the initial singularity was taken to be the first - cause of the universe .",
    "this of course prompted questions of what caused the singularity and what happened before the singularity .",
    "the standard answer to what happened before the big bang singularity has been that time was created at the singularity , along with space , and that there was no time before the big bang . asking what happened before the big bang was considered to be like asking what is south of the south pole .",
    "but particularly troublesome was the question of what caused the initial singularity to have its almost perfect uniformity  for otherwise the microwave background radiation would be of vastly different temperatures in different directions on the sky",
    ". yet the initial singularity could not be exactly uniform , for then we would have a perfect friedmann model with no fluctuations which would form no galaxies .",
    "it needed to be almost , but not quite perfectly uniform  a remarkable situation  how did it get that way ?",
    "these seemed to be special initial conditions with no explanation for how they got that way .",
    "another problem was that singularities in physics are usually smeared by quantum effects .",
    "as we extrapolated back toward the initial singularity ( of infinite density ) , we would first reach a surface where the density was equal to the planck density and at this epoch classical general relativity would break down .",
    "we could not extrapolate confidently back to infinite density , we could only say that we would eventually reach a place where quantum effects should become important and where classical general relativity no longer applied .",
    "since we do not have a theory of quantum gravity or a theory - of - everything we could honestly say that the singularity theorems only told us that we would find regions in the early universe where the density exceeded the gut or planck densities beyond which we did not know what happened  rather much like the terra incognita of old maps . we could not then say how our universe formed .",
    "so , questions about how the initial big bang singularity was formed and what preceded it remained .",
    "the closed friedmann model , popular because it is compact and therefore needs no boundary conditions , re - collapses in a finite time in the future to form a big crunch singularity at the end .",
    "singularity theorems tell us that in a collapsing universe the final big crunch singularity can not be avoided .",
    "classical general relativity tells us that a closed universe begins with a singularity and ends with a singularity , with nothing before and nothing after .",
    "nevertheless , many people speculated that there could be more than one connected cycle  after all , the singularities only indicated a breakdown of classical general relativity and the quantum terra incognita at the planck density might allow a cosmology collapsing toward a big crunch to bounce and make another big bang @xcite .",
    "in support of this is the fact that de  sitter space ( representing the geometry of a false vacuum  an inflationary state as proposed by guth @xcite  with a large cosmological constant ) looks like a spatially closed @xmath1 universe whose radius as a function of proper time is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the radius of the de  sitter space and @xmath12 is the cosmological constant ( throughout the paper we use units @xmath13 ) , which is a collapsing cosmology which bounces and turns into an expanding one .",
    "thus if quantum gravitational effects make the geometry look like de  sitter space once the density reaches the planck density as some have suggested @xcite , then a big crunch singularity might be avoided as the closed universe bounced and began a big bang all over again .",
    "this bouncing model avoids the first - cause problem .",
    "the answer to what caused our universe in this model is `` the collapse of the previous universe '' , and so on .",
    "an infinite number of expansion and contraction cycles make up the universe ( note the capital u  in this paper this denotes the ensemble of causally connected universes ) which consists of an infinite number of closed big bang models laid out in time like pearls on a string .",
    "the universe ( the infinite string of pearls ) has always been in existence and will always be in existence , even though our cycle , our standard closed big bang cosmology ( our pearl ) has a finite duration .",
    "so we are back to aristotle , with an eternal universe , and close to einstein with just an oscillating ( rather than static ) closed universe that has infinite duration to the past and future .",
    "thus in this picture there is no first - cause because the universe has existed infinitely far back in the past .",
    "the oscillating universe was thought to have some problems with entropy @xcite .",
    "entropy is steadily increasing with time , and so each cycle would seem to be more disordered than the one that preceded it . since our universe has a finite entropy per baryon it was argued , there could not be an infinite number of cycles preceding us .",
    "likewise it was argued that each cycle of the universe should be larger than the preceding one , so if there were an infinite number preceding us , our universe would have to look indistinguishable from flat ( i.e. , closed but having an infinite radius of curvature ) . the real challenge in this model is to produce initial conditions for our universe ( our pearl ) that were as uniform and low entropy as observed .",
    "cobe tells us that our universe at early times was uniform to one part in a hundred thousand @xcite . at late times",
    "we expect the universe at the big crunch to be very non - uniform as black hole singularities combine to form the big crunch . in the early universe",
    "the weyl tensor is zero , whereas at the big crunch it would be large @xcite .",
    "how does the chaotic high - entropy state at the big crunch get recycled into the low - entropy , nearly uniform , state of the next big bang ? if it does not , then after an infinite number of cycles , why are we not in a universe with chaotic initial conditions ?",
    "entropy and the direction of time may be intimately tied up with this difference between the big bang and the big crunch .",
    "maxwell s equations ( and the field equations of general relativity ) are time - symmetric , so why do we see only retarded potentials ?",
    "wheeler and feynman addressed this with their absorber theory @xcite .",
    "they supposed that an electron shaken today produces half - advanced - half - retarded fields .",
    "the half - advanced fields propagate back in time toward the early universe where they are absorbed ( towards the past the universe is a perfect absorber ) by shaking charged particles in the early universe .",
    "these charged particles in turn emit half - advanced - half - retarded fields ; their half - retarded fields propagate toward the future where they : ( a ) perfectly cancel the half - advanced fields of the original electron , ( b ) add to its retarded fields to produce the electron s full retarded field , and ( c ) produce a force on the electron which is equal to the classical radiative reaction force .",
    "thus , the electron only experiences forces due to fields from other charged particles .",
    "this is a particularly ingenious solution .",
    "it requires only that the early universe is opaque  which it is  and that the initial conditions are low - entropy ; that is , there is a cancelation of half - advanced fields from the future by half - retarded fields from the past , leaving no `` signals '' in the early universe from later events  a state of low - entropy .",
    "( note that this argument works equally well in an open universe where the universe may not be optically thick toward the future  all that is required is that the universe be a perfect absorber in the past , i.e. , toward the state of low - entropy . )",
    "wheeler and feynman noted that entropy is time - symmetric like maxwell s equations .",
    "if you find an ice cube on the stove , and then come back and re - observe it a minute later , you will likely find it half - melted .",
    "usually an ice cube gets on a stove by someone just putting it there ( initial conditions ) , but suppose we had a truly isolated system so that the ice cube we found was just a statistical fluctuation . then if we asked what we would see if we had observed one minute _ before _ our first observation , we will also be likely to see a half - melted ice cube , for finding a still larger ice cube one minute before would be unlikely because it would represent an even more unlikely statistical fluctuation than the original ice cube . in an _ isolated _ system ,",
    "an ( improbable ) state of low - entropy is likely to be both followed and preceded by states of higher - entropy in a time - symmetric fashion . given that the early universe represents a state of high order , it is thus not surprising to find entropy increasing after that . thus , according to wheeler and feynman @xcite , the fact that the retarded potentials arrow of time and the entropy arrow of time point in the same direction is simply a reflection of the low - entropy nature of the big bang .",
    "the big crunch is high - entropy , so time follows from past to future between the big bang and the big crunch .",
    "thus , in an oscillating universe scenario , we might expect entropy to go in the opposite direction with respect to time , in the previous cycle of oscillation . in that previous universe",
    "there would be only advanced potentials and observers there would sense a direction of time opposite to ours ( and would have a reversed definition of matter and anti - matter because of cpt invariance ) .",
    "thus the cycle previous to us would , according to _ our _ definition of time , have advanced potentials and would end with a uniform low - entropy big crunch and begin with a chaotic high - entropy big bang ( see gott @xcite for further discussion ) . thus , an infinite string of oscillating universes could have alternating high and low - entropy singularities , with the direction of the entropy ( and causality  via electromagnetic potentials ) time - reversing on each succeeding cycle .",
    "every observer using the entropy direction of time would see in his `` past '' a low - entropy singularity ( which he would call a big bang ) and in his `` future '' a high - entropy singularity ( which he could call a big crunch ) . then the mystery is why the low - entropy big bangs exist  they now look improbable . an oscillating universe with chaotic bangs and crunches and half - advanced - half - retarded potentials throughout would seem more likely .",
    "at this point anthropic arguments @xcite could be brought in to say that only low - entropy big bangs might produce intelligent observers and that , with an infinite number of universes in the string , eventually there would be  by chance  a sufficiently low - entropy big bang to produce intelligent observers . still , the uniformity of the early universe that we observe seems to be more than that required to produce intelligent observers , so we might wonder whether a random intelligent observer in such a universe would be expected to see initial conditions in his / her big bang as uniform as ours .",
    "( among intelligent observers , the copernican principle tells us that you should not expect to be special . out of all the places for intelligent observers to be",
    "there are by definition only a few special places and many non - special places , so you should expect to be in one of the many non - special places @xcite . )",
    "guth s proposal of inflation @xcite offered an explanation of why the initial conditions in the big bang should be approximately , but not exactly uniform .",
    "( for review of inflation see @xcite . ) in the standard big bang cosmology this was always a puzzle because antipodal points on the sky on the last scattering surface at @xmath14 had not had time to be in communication with each other .",
    "when we see two regions which are at the same temperature , the usual explanation is that they have at some time in the past been in causal communication and have reached thermal equilibrium with each other .",
    "but there is not enough time to do this in the standard big bang model where the expansion of the scale factor at early times is @xmath15 .",
    "grand unified theories ( gut ) of particle physics suggest that at early times there might have been a non - zero cosmological constant @xmath12 , which then decayed to the zero cosmological constant we see today .",
    "this means that the early universe approximates de  sitter space with a radius @xmath11 whose expansion rate at late times approaches @xmath16 .",
    "regions that start off very close together , and have time to thermally equilibrate , end up very far apart .",
    "when they become separated by a distance @xmath17 , they effectively pass out of causal contact  if inflation were to continue forever , they would be beyond each other s event horizons .",
    "but eventually the epoch of inflation ends , the energy density of the cosmological constant is dumped into thermal radiation , and the expansion then continues as @xmath15 as in a radiation - dominated big bang cosmology . as the regions slow their expansion from each other , enough time elapses so that they are able to interchange photons once again and they come back into effective causal contact .",
    "as bill press once said , they say `` hello '' , `` goodbye '' , and `` hello again '' . when they say `` hello again '' they appear just like regions in a standard big bang cosmology that are saying `` hello '' for the first time ( i.e. , are just coming within the particle horizon ) except that with inflation these regions are already in thermal equilibrium with each other , because they have seen each other in the past . inflation also gives a natural explanation for why the observed radius of curvature of the universe is so large ( @xmath18 ; here @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 is the hubble constant ) . during the big bang phase ,",
    "as the universe expands , the radius of the universe @xmath21 expands by the same factor as the characteristic wavelength @xmath22 of the microwave background photons , so @xmath23 .",
    "how should we explain this large observed dimensionless number ?",
    "inflation makes this easy .",
    "the energy density during the inflationary epoch is @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the characteristic wavelength of thermal radiation which would have that density . even if @xmath21 started out of the same order as @xmath22 , by the end of the inflationary epoch @xmath25 , providing that the inflationary epoch lasts at least as long as @xmath26 , or @xmath27 @xmath28-folding times . at the end of the inflationary epoch when the inflationary vacuum of density @xmath24 decays and is converted into an equivalent amount of thermal radiation",
    ", the wavelength of that radiation will be @xmath22 and the ratio of @xmath29 is fixed at a constant value which is a dimensionless constant @xmath30 , retained as the universe continues to expand in the radiation and matter - dominated epochs .",
    "thus , even a short run of inflation , of @xmath27 @xmath28-folding times or more , is sufficient to explain why the universe is as large as it is observed to be .",
    "another success of inflation is that the observed zeldovich - peebles - yu - harrison fluctuation spectrum with index @xmath31 @xcite has been naturally predicted as the result of random quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the inflationary power spectrum with cdm has been amazingly successful in explaining the qualitative features of observed galaxy clustering ( cf .",
    "the amount of large scale power seen in the observations suggests an inflationary cdm power spectrum with @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "gott @xcite has shown how an open inflationary model might be produced .",
    "the initial inflationary state approximates de  sitter space , which can be pictured by embedding it as the surface @xmath33 in a five - dimensional minkowski space with metric @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "slice de  sitter space along surfaces of @xmath35 , then the slices are three - spheres of positive curvature @xmath36 where @xmath37 . if @xmath38 measures the proper time , then @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this is a closed universe that contracts then re - expands  at late times expanding exponentially as a function of proper time .",
    "if slices of @xmath41 are chosen , the slices have a flat geometry and the expansion is exponential with @xmath42 . if the slices are vertical ( @xmath43 ) , then the intersection with the surface is @xmath44 , a hyperboloid @xmath45 living in a minkowski space , where @xmath46 .",
    "this is a negatively curved surface with a radius of curvature @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath38 be the proper time from the event e ( @xmath47 ) in the de  sitter space .",
    "then the entire future of e can be described as an open @xmath4 cosmology where @xmath48 . at early times , @xmath49 , near e , @xmath50 , and",
    "the model resembles a milne cosmology @xcite , but at late times the model expands exponentially with time as expected for inflation .",
    "this is a negatively curved ( open ) friedmann model with a cosmological constant and nothing else .",
    "note that the entire negatively curved hyperboloid ( @xmath44 ) , which extends to infinity , is nevertheless causally connected because all points on it have the event e in their past light cone .",
    "thus , the universe should have a microwave background that is isotropic , except for small quantum fluctuations . at a proper time",
    "@xmath51 after the event e , the cosmological constant would decay leaving us with a hot big bang open ( @xmath4 ) cosmology with a radius of curvature of @xmath52 at the end of the inflationary epoch . if @xmath53 , then @xmath54 is a few tenths today ; if @xmath55 , then @xmath56 today @xcite .",
    "gott @xcite noted that this solution looks just like the interior of a coleman bubble @xcite .",
    "coleman and de  luccia @xcite showed that if a metastable symmetric vacuum ( with the higgs field @xmath57 ) , with positive cosmological constant @xmath12 were to decay by tunneling directly through a barrier to reach the current vacuum with a zero cosmological constant ( where the higgs field @xmath58 ) , then it would do this by forming a bubble of low - density vacuum of radius @xmath59 around an event e. the pressure inside the bubble is zero while the pressure outside is negative ( equal to @xmath60 ) , so the bubble wall accelerates outward , forming in spacetime a hyperboloid of one sheet ( a slice of de  sitter space with @xmath61 ) .",
    "this bubble wall surrounds and is asymptotic to the future light cone of e. if the tunneling is direct , the space inside the bubble is minkowski space ( like a slice @xmath62 in the embedding space , which is flat ) .",
    "the inside of the future light cone of e thus looks like a milne cosmology with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "gott @xcite noted that what was needed to produce a realistic open model with @xmath54 of a few tenths today was to have the inflation continue inside the bubble for about @xmath27 @xmath28-folding times .",
    "thus , our universe was one of the bubbles and this solved the problem of guth s inflation that in general one expected the bubbles not to percolate @xcite .",
    "but , from inside one of the bubbles , our view could be isotropic @xcite .",
    "it was not long before a concrete mechanism to produce such continued inflation inside the bubble was proposed .",
    "a couple of weeks after gott s paper appeared linde s @xcite proposal of new inflation appeared , followed shortly by albrecht and steinhardt @xcite .",
    "they proposed that the higgs vacuum potential @xmath65 had a local minimum at @xmath57 where @xmath66 .",
    "then there was a barrier at @xmath67 , followed by a long flat plateau from @xmath68 to @xmath69 where it drops precipitately to zero at @xmath69 .",
    "the relation of this to the open bubble universe s geometry is outlined by gott @xcite ( see fig .  1 and fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the de  sitter space outside the bubble wall has @xmath57 . between the bubble wall , at a spacelike separation @xmath59 from the event e , and the end of the inflation at the hyperboloid @xmath44 which is the set of points at a future timelike separation of @xmath51 from e , the higgs field is between @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and @xmath51 is the time it takes the field ( after tunneling ) to roll along the long plateau [ where @xmath65 is approximately equal to @xmath24 and the geometry is approximately de sitter ] .",
    "after that epoch , @xmath58 where the energy density has been dumped into thermal radiation and the vacuum density is zero ( i.e. , a standard open big bang model ) . in order that inflation proceeds and the bubbles do not percolate , it is required that the probability of forming a bubble in de  sitter space per four volume @xmath70 is @xmath71 where @xmath72 @xcite . in order that there be a greater than @xmath73 chance that no bubble should have collided with our bubble by now , so as to be visible in our past light cone , @xmath74 for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 today @xcite , but this is no problem since we expect tunneling probabilities through a barrier to be exponentially small .",
    "this model has an event horizon , which is the future light cone of an event e@xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) which is antipodal to e. light from events within the future light cone of e@xmath78 never reaches events inside the future light cone of e. so we are surrounded by an event horizon .",
    "this produces hawking radiation ; and , if @xmath17 is of order the planck length , then the gibbons - hawking thermal state @xcite ( which looks like a cosmological constant due to the trace anomaly @xcite ) should be dynamically important @xcite .",
    "if we observe @xmath80 and @xmath81 , then @xmath4 and we need inflation more than ever  we still need it to explain the isotropy of the microwave background radiation and we would now have a large but _ finite _ radius of curvature to explain , which @xmath27 @xmath28-folds of inflation could naturally produce .",
    "when gott told this to linde in 1982 , linde said , yes , if we found that @xmath80 , he would still have to believe in inflation but he would have a headache in the morning ! why ? because one has to produce a particular amount of inflation , approximately @xmath27 @xmath28-folds .",
    "if there were @xmath82 @xmath28-folds or @xmath82 million @xmath28-folds , then @xmath54 currently would be only slightly less than 1 .",
    "so there would be what is called a `` fine tuning of parameters '' needed to produce the observed results .",
    "the single - bubble open inflationary model @xcite discussed above has recently come back into fashion because of a number of important developments .",
    "on the theoretical side , ratra and peebles @xcite have shown how to calculate quantum fluctuations in the @xmath44 hyperbolic geometry with @xmath48 during the inflationary epoch inside the bubble in the single bubble model .",
    "this allows predictions of fluctuations in the microwave background .",
    "bucher , goldhaber , and turok @xcite have extended these calculations , as well as yamamoto , sasaki and tanaka @xcite .",
    "importantly , they have explained @xcite that the fine tuning in these models is only `` logarithmic '' and , therefore , not so serious .",
    "linde and mezhlmian @xcite have shown how there are reasonable potentials which could produce such bubble universes with different values of @xmath54 . in a standard chaotic inflationary potential @xmath65 @xcite",
    ", one could simply build in a bump , so that one would randomly walk to the top of the curve via quantum fluctuations and then roll down till one lodged behind the bump in a metastable local minimum .",
    "one would then tunnel through the bump , forming bubbles that would roll down to the bottom in a time @xmath51 .",
    "one could have a two - dimensional potential @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a constant and there is a metastable trough at @xmath85 with altitude @xmath86 with a barrier on both sides , but one could tunnel through the barrier to reach @xmath87 where @xmath88 has a true minimum , and at fixed @xmath59 , is proportional to @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "then individual bubbles could tunnel across the barrier at different values of @xmath90 , and hence have different roll - down times @xmath51 and thus different values of @xmath54 . with a myriad of open universes being created ,",
    "anthropic arguments @xcite come into play and if shorter roll - down times were more probable than large ones , we might not be surprised to find ourselves in a model which had @xmath54 of a few tenths , since if @xmath54 is too small , no galaxies will form @xcite .",

    "the failure of hartle and hawking s path integral calculation is also manifested in the fact that de  sitter space is _ not _ a solution of the friedmann equation if the `` zero - point - energy '' of the conformally coupled scalar field is considered , whereas the semiclassical approximation implies that the principal contribution to the path integral of the wave function comes from the configurations which solve einstein s equations .",
    "one may hope to overcome this difficulty by introducing a scalar field with a flat potential @xmath65 ( as in the inflation case ) .",
    "but this does not apply to the quantum cosmology case since as @xmath227 the universe always becomes radiation - dominated unless the energy density of radiation is exactly zero ( but the uncertainty principle does not allow this case to occur ) .",
    "from the arguments in the last section , we find that the universe does _ not _ seem to be created from nothing . on the other hand ,",
    "if the universe is created from _ something _ , that something could have been _",
    "itself_. thus it is possible that the universe is its own mother .",
    "in such a case , if we trace the history of the universe backward , inevitably we will enter a region of ctcs .",
    "therefore ctcs may play an important role in the creation of the universe .",
    "it is interesting to note that hawking and penrose s singularity theorems do not apply if the universe has had ctcs . and",
    ", it has been shown that , if a compact lorentzian spacetime undergoes topology changes , there must be ctcs in this spacetime @xcite .",
    "[ basically there are two type of spacetimes with ctcs : for the first type , there are ctcs everywhere ( gdel space belongs to this type ) ; for the second type , the ctcs are confined within some regions and there exists at least one region where there are no closed causal ( timelike or null ) curves , and the regions with ctcs are separated from the regions without closed causal curves by cauchy horizons ( misner space belongs to this type ) . in this paper , with the word `` spacetimes with ctcs '' we always refer to the second type unless otherwise specified . ]    while in classical general relativity there exist many solutions with ctcs , some calculations of vacuum polarization of quantum fields in spacetimes with ctcs indicated that the energy - momentum tensor ( in this paper when we deal with quantum fields , with the word `` the energy - momentum tensor '' we always refer to `` the renormalized energy - momentum tensor '' because `` the unrenormalized energy - momentum tensor '' has no physical meaning ) diverges as one approaches the cauchy horizon separating the region with ctcs from the region without closed causal curves .",
    "this means that spacetimes with ctcs may be unstable against vacuum polarization since when the energy - momentum tensor is fed back to the semiclassical einstein s equations ( i.e. einstein s equations with quantum corrections to the energy - momentum tensor of matter fields ) the back - reaction may distort the spacetime geometry so strongly that a singularity may form and ctcs may be destroyed .",
    "based on some of these calculations , hawking @xcite has proposed the chronology protection conjecture which states that the laws of physics do not allow the appearance of ctcs .",
    "( it should be mentioned that the chronology protection conjecture does _ not _ provide any restriction on spacetimes with ctcs but no cauchy horizons since there is _ no _ any indication that this type of spacetime is unstable against vacuum polarization . in the next section we will show a simple example of a spacetime with ctcs but no cauchy horizons , where the energy - momentum tensor is finite everywhere . )",
    "but , on the other hand , li , xu , and liu @xcite have pointed out that even if the energy - momentum tensor of vacuum polarization diverges at the cauchy horizon , it does _ not _ mean that ctcs must be prevented by physical laws because : ( 1 ) einstein s equations are local equations and the energy - momentum tensor may diverge only at the cauchy horizon ( or at the polarized hypersurfaces ) and be well - behaved elsewhere within the region with ctcs ; ( 2 ) the divergence of the energy - momentum tensor at the cauchy horizon does _ not _ mean that the cauchy horizon must be destroyed by the back - reaction of vacuum polarization , _ but _ instead means that near the cauchy horizon the usual quantum field theory on a prescribed classical spacetime background can not be used and the quantum effect of gravity must be considered .",
    "( this is like the case that hawking and penrose s singularity theorems do _ not _ mean that the big bang cosmology is wrong but mean that near the big bang singularity quantum gravity effects become important @xcite . )",
    "when hawking proposed his chronology protection conjecture , hawking @xcite and kim and thorne @xcite had a controversy over whether quantum gravity can save ctcs .",
    "kim and thorne claimed that quantum gravitational effects would cut the divergence off when an observer s proper time from crossing the cauchy horizon was the planck time , and this would only give such a small perturbation on the metric that the cauchy horizon could not be destroyed .",
    "but , hawking @xcite noted that one would expect the quantum gravitational cut - off to occur when the invariant distance from the cauchy horizon was of order the planck length , and this would give a very strong perturbation on the metric so that the cauchy horizon would be destroyed . since there",
    "does not exist a self - consistent quantum theory of gravity at present , we can not judge who ( hawking or kim and thorne ) is right .",
    "but in any case , these arguments imply that in the case of a spacetime with ctcs where the energy - momentum tensor of vacuum polarization diverges at the cauchy horizon , quantum gravity effects should become important near the cauchy horizon .",
    "li , xu , and liu @xcite have argued that if the effects of quantum gravity are considered , in a spacetime with ctcs the region with ctcs and the region without closed causal curves may be separated by a _ quantum barrier _",

    "li and gott @xcite have found that this quantum state is the `` adapted '' rindler vacuum ( i.e. the usual rindler vacuum with multiple images ) and it is a self - consistent vacuum state because it solves the semiclassical einstein s equations exactly .",

    ", we find that for a multiply connected de  sitter space there also exists a self - consistent vacuum state for a conformally coupled scalar field ( see section [ ix ] ) .",
    "thorne @xcite has noted that , even if hawking s argument that a quantum gravitational cut - off would occur when the geometric invariant distance from the cauchy horizon is of order the planck length is correct , by using two wormholes the metric fluctuations near the cauchy horizon can be made arbitrarily small so a spacetime with ctcs created from two wormholes can be stable against vacuum polarization .",
    "recently visser @xcite has generalized this result to the roman - ring case .",
    "the above arguments indicate that the back - reaction of vacuum polarization may _ not _ destroy the cauchy horizon in spacetimes with ctcs , and thus such spacetimes can be stable against vacuum polarization .",
    "in a recent paper , cassidy and hawking @xcite have admitted that `` back - reaction does not enforce chronology protection '' . on the other hand , cassidy and hawking @xcite",
    "have argued that the `` number of states '' may enforce the chronology protection conjecture since `` this quantity will always tend to zero as one tries to introduce ctcs '' .",
    "their arguments are based on the fact that for the particular spacetime with ctcs they constructed [ which is the product of a multiply connected ( via a boost ) three - dimensional de  sitter space and @xmath228 the entropy of a massless scalar field diverges to minus infinity when the spacetime develops ctcs @xcite .",
    "however , whether this conclusion holds for general spacetimes with ctcs remains an open question and further research is required . and , from ordinary statistical thermodynamics we know that entropy is always positive , so the physical meaning of a _ negative",

    "the number of states in phase space is given by @xmath229 where @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 ( @xmath233 ) is a canonical coordinate , @xmath234 is a canonical momentum , and @xmath235 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the uncertainty principle demands that @xmath236 and thus we should always have @xmath237 .",
    "thus the `` fact '' that the number of states tends to zero as one tries to develop ctcs ( i.e. as one approaches the cauchy horizon ) may simply imply that near the cauchy horizon quantum effects of gravity can not be neglected , which is consistent with li , xu , and liu s argument @xcite .",
    "the entropy is defined by @xmath238 where @xmath239 is the number of states and @xmath240 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "when @xmath239 is small , quantization of the entropy becomes important ( remember that the number of states @xmath239 is always an integer ) .",
    "the entropy can not _ continuously _ tend to negative infinity ; it should _ jump _ from @xmath241 to @xmath242 , _ jump _ from @xmath242 to zero ( but in cassidy and hawking s arguments @xcite we have not seen such a jump ) , then the uncertainty principle demands that the entropy should stand on the zero value as one approaches the cauchy horizon . on the other hand ,",
    "ordinary continuous thermodynamics holds only for the case with @xmath243 .",
    "thus , as one approaches the cauchy horizon the thermodynamic limit has already been violated and ordinary thermodynamics should be revised near the cauchy horizon . in other words ,",
    "cassidy and hawking s results @xcite can not be extended to the cauchy horizon .",
    "based on the fact that the effective action density diverges at the polarized hypersurfaces of spacetimes with ctcs @xcite , cassidy and hawking @xcite have argued that the effective action `` would provide new insight into issues of chronology protection '' .",
    "but we should note that the effective action is only a _",
    "tool _ for computing some physical quantities ( such as the energy - momentum tensor ) and the effective action itself has not much physical meaning .",
    "the divergence of the effective action may imply that the effective action is not a good _ tool _ as the polarized hypersurfaces are approached .",
    "our argument is supported by the fact that there exist many examples for which the energy - momentum tensor is finite everywhere , as mentioned above .",
    "recently , kay , radzikowski , and wald @xcite have proved two theorems which demonstrate that some fundamental quantities such as hadamard functions and energy - momentum tensors must be ill - defined on a compactly generated cauchy horizon in a spacetime with ctcs , as one extends the _ usual _ quantum field theory in a global hyperbolic spacetime to an acausal spacetime with a compactly generated cauchy horizon . basically speaking ,",
    "their theorems imply that the _ usual _ quantum field theory can not be _ directly _ extended to a spacetime with ctcs @xcite .",
    "their theorems tell us that serious difficulties arise when attempting to _ define _ quantum field theory on a spacetime with a compactly generated cauchy horizon @xcite . the ordinary quantum field theory must be significantly changed or some new approach must be introduced when one tries to do quantum field theory on a spacetime with ctcs . a candidate procedure for overcoming",
    "this difficulty is the euclidean quantization proposed by hawking @xcite .",
    "quantum field theory is well - defined in a euclidean space because there are no ctcs in a euclidean space @xcite .",
    "in fact , even in simply connected minkowski spacetime , quantum field theory is _ not _ well - defined since the path integral does not converge . to overcome",
    "this difficulty , the technique of wick - rotation ( which is essentially equivalent to euclidean quantization ) is used .",
    "kay , radzikowski , and wald @xcite have also argued that their results may be interpreted as indicating that in order to create ctcs it would be necessary to enter a regime where quantum effects of gravity will be dominant ( see also the discussions of visser @xcite ) ; this is also consistent with li , xu , and liu s arguments @xcite .",
    "cramer and kay @xcite have shown that kay , radzikowski , and wald s theorems @xcite also apply to misner space ( for sushkov s automorphic field case @xcite and krasnikov s two - dimensional case @xcite , respectively ) where the cauchy horizon is not compactly generated , in the sense that the energy - momentum tensor must be ill - defined on the cauchy horizon itself .",
    "but we note that this only happens in a set of measure zero which does not make much sense in physics for if the renormalized energy - momentum tensor is zero everywhere except on a set of measure zero where it is formally ill - defined , then continuity would seem to require setting it to zero there also @xcite .",
    "perhaps a conclusion on the chronology protection conjecture can only be reached after we have a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "however , we can conclude that the back - reaction of vacuum polarization does _ not _ enforce the chronology protection conjecture , a point hawking himself also admits @xcite .",
    "( originally the back - reaction of vacuum polarization was supposed to be the strongest candidate for chronology protection @xcite . )",

    "the `` knob '' itself would be the the interior of the bubble , containing the positive cosmological constant , and sitting in the metastable vacuum state with @xmath836 .",

    "the interior of the `` knob '' is hidden from an observer in the external spacetime by an event horizon at @xmath838 .",
    "eventually the black hole evaporates via hawking radiation @xcite , leaving a flat external spacetime ( actually part of an open big bang universe ) with simply a coordinate singularity at @xmath480 as seen from outside .",

    "one _ of these open bubble universes simply turns out to be the _ original _ open universe where that advanced civilization made the baby de  sitter universe in the first place ( fig .",
    "now the model is multiply connected , with no earliest event .",
    "there is a cauchy horizon ( @xmath839 , see fig .  [ f7 ] ) separating the region of ctcs from the later region that does not contain them .",
    "this cauchy horizon is generated by ingoing closed null geodesics that represent signals that could be sent toward the black hole , which then tunnel across the euclidean tunneling section jumping across the einstein - rosen bridge and then continuing as ingoing signals to enter the de  sitter space and reach the open single bubble in the de  sitter space ( that turns out to be the original bubble in which the tunneling event occurs ) .",
    "a retarded photon traveling around one of those closed null geodesics will be red - shifted more and more on each cycle , thus not causing an instability .",
    "another novel effect is that although these null generators are converging just before the tunneling event , they are diverging just after the tunneling event , having jumped to the other side of the einstein - rosen bridge .",
    "thus , converging rays are turned into diverging rays ( as in the wormhole solution ) during the tunneling event without violating the weak energy condition .",
    "these closed null geodesics need not be infinitely extendible in affine distance toward the past . it would seem that it can be arranged that the renormalized energy - momentum tensor does not blow up on this cauchy horizon so that a self - consistent solution is possible . using the method of images , note that the @xmath239-th image is from @xmath239 cycles around the multiply connected spacetime .",

    "thus , to reach the @xmath239-th image one has to pass through the hot optically thick thermal radiation of the hot big bang @xmath239 times . and this will cause the contribution of the @xmath239-th image to the renormalized energy - momentum tensor to be exponentially damped by a factor @xmath842 where @xmath843 ( where @xmath250 is the number density of target particles , @xmath367 is the thickness of hot material , @xmath844 is the total cross - section ) .",

    "li @xcite has estimated the fluctuation of the metric of the background spacetime caused by vacuum polarization with absorption , which is a small number in most cases .",
    "if the absorption is caused by electron - positron pair production by a photon in a photon - electron collision , the maximum value of the metric fluctuation is @xmath845 , where @xmath846 is the planck length , @xmath847 is the classical radius of electron , @xmath696 is the spatial distance between the identified points in the frame of rest relative to the absorber @xcite .",
    "if we take @xmath696 to be the hubble radius at the recombination epoch ( @xmath848 cm ) , we have @xmath849 .",

    "[ f7 ] . during the tunneling event",
    ", the trajectory may be approximated as a classical space with four spacelike dimensions solving einstein s equations , with the potential inverted , so that this euclidean section bridges the gap between the two classical turning points .",
    "( in such a case , the concepts of ctcs and closed null curves should be generalized to contain a spacelike interval .",
    "thus , there are neither closed null geodesics nor closed timelike geodesics with the traditional definitions . according to li @xcite ,",

    "in fact , if the probability for a civilization to form on a habitable planet like the earth and eventually succeed at creating a universe in the lab is some finite number greater than zero ( even if it is very low ) , then our universe ( if it is an open bubble universe ) should spawn an infinite number of such baby universes .",
    "this notion has caused harrison @xcite to speculate that our universe was created in this way in the lab by some super - civilization in a previous universe .",
    "he noted correctly that if super - civilizations in a universe can create many baby universes , then baby universes created in this way should greatly outnumber the parent universes , and that you ( being not special ) are simply likely to live in one of the many baby universes , because there are so many more of them .",
    "here he is using implicitly the formulation of gott @xcite that according to the copernican principle , out of all the places for intelligent observers to be , there are , by definition , only a few special places and many non - special places , and you are simply more likely to be in one of the many non - special places . thus ,",
    "if there are many baby universes created by intelligent supercivilizations in an infinite open bubble universe , then you are likely to live in a baby universe created in this way .",
    "harrison uses this idea to explain the strong anthropic principle . the strong anthropic principle",
    "as advanced by carter @xcite says that the laws of physics , in our universe at least , must be such as to allow the development of the intelligent life .",
    "because we are here .",
    "it is just a self - consistency argument .",
    "this might lead some to believe , particularly with inflationary cosmologies that are capable of producing an infinite number of bubble universes , that these different universes might develop with many different laws of physics , given a complicated , many - dimensional inflationary potential with many different minima , and many different low energy laws of physics .",
    "if some of these did not allow the development of intelligent life and some of these did , well , which type of universe would you expect to find yourself in ?",
    " one that allowed intelligent observers , of course .",
    "( by the same argument , you are not surprised to find yourself on a habitable planet  earth  although such habitable planets may well be outnumbered by uninhabitable ones  mercury , venus , pluto , etc . )",
    "thus , there may be many more universes that have laws of physics that do not allow intelligent life  you just would not find yourself living there .",
    "it has been noticed that there are various coincidences in the physical constants  like the numerical value of the fine structure constant , or the ratio of the electron to proton mass , or the energy levels in the carbon nucleus  which , if they were very different , would make intelligent life either impossible , or much less likely .",
    "if we observe such a coincidence , according to carter @xcite , it simply means that if it were otherwise , we would not be here .",
    "harrison @xcite has noted that if intelligent civilizations made baby universes they might well , by intelligent choice , make universes that purposely had such coincidences in them in order to foster the development of intelligent life in the baby universes they created .",
    "if that were the case , then the majority of universes would have laws of physics conducive to the formation of intelligent life . in this case",
    ", the reason that we observe such coincidences is that a previous intelligent civilization made them that way .",
    "one might even speculate in this scenario that if they were smart enough , they could have left us a message of sorts in these dimensionless numbers ( a theme that resonates , by the way , with part of carl sagan s thesis in _ contact _ ) .",
    "however , it is unclear whether any super - civilization would be able to control the laws of physics in the universes they created .",
    "all , they might reasonably be able to do would be to drive the baby universe up into a particular metastable vacuum @xcite .",
    "but then , such a metastable vacuum inflates in the knob , and an infinite number of bubble universes form later , with perhaps many different laws of physics depending on how they tunnel away from the metastable vacuum and which of the many potential minima they roll down into . controlling these phase transitions would seem difficult .",
    "thus , it would seem difficult for the super - civilization that made the metastable state that later gave rise to our universe to have been able to manipulate the physical constants in our universe .",
    "harrison s model could occur in many generations , making it likely that we were produced as great , great , ... , great grandchildren universes from a sequence of intelligent civilizations .",
    "harrison @xcite was able to explain all the universes by this mechanism except for the first one ! for that , he had to rely on natural mechanisms .",
    "this seems to be an unfortunate gap . in our scenario , suppose that `` first '' universe simply turned out to be one of the infinite ones formed later by intelligent civilizations",
    ". then the universe  note capital u  would be multiply connected , and would have a region of ctcs ; all of the individual universes would owe their birth to some intelligent civilization in particular in this picture .    all this may overestimate the importance of intelligent civilizations .",
    "it may be that bubbles of inflating metastable vacuum are simply produced at late times in any big bang cosmology by natural processes , and that baby universes produced by natural processes may vastly outnumber those produced by intelligent civilizations .",
    "such a mechanism has been considered by frolov , markov , and mukhanov @xcite .",
    "they considered the hypothesis that spacetime curvature is limited by quantum mechanics and that as this limit is approached , the curvature approaches that of de  sitter space .",
    "then , as any black hole collapses , the curvature increases as the singularity is approached ; but before getting there it will convert into a collapsing de  sitter solution .",
    "this can be done in detail in the following way . inside the horizon , but outside the collapsing star the geometry becomes schwarzschild which is a radially collapsing but stretching cylinder .",
    "this can be matched onto a radially collapsing and radially shrinking cylinder in de  sitter space as described by the metric in eq .",
    "( [ e50 ] ) with the time @xmath267 being negative and the coordinate @xmath810 being unbounded rather than periodic .",
    "both surfaces are cylinders with identical intrinsic curvature , but with different extrinsic curvature .",
    "this mismatch is cured by introducing a shell of matter which converts the stretching of the schwarzschild cylinder to collapsing as well which then matches onto the collapsing de  sitter solution .",
    "this phase transition may occur in segments which then merge as noted by barabes and frolov @xcite .",
    "the de  sitter solution then bounces and becomes an expanding de sitter solution which can in turn spawn an infinite number of open bubble universes .",
    "this all happens behind the event horizon of the black hole . within the de  sitter phase ,",
    "one finds a cauchy horizon like the interior cauchy horizon of the reisner - nordstrom solution , but this inner cauchy horizon is not unstable because the curvature is bounded by the de  sitter value so the curvature is not allowed to blow up on the inner horizon .",
    "( this is an argument that one could also rely on to produce self - consistent multiply connected de  sitter phases with ctcs  if needed . )",
    "this model thus produces , inside the black hole , to the future , and behind the event horizon , an expanding de  sitter phase that has a beginning , just like vilenkin s tunneling universe .",
    "if one of those bubble universes simply turns out to be the original one in which the black hole formed , then the solution is multiply connected with a region of ctcs .",
    "this would make every black hole produce an infinite number of universes",
    ". this would be the dominant mechanism for making new bubble universes , since the number of black holes in our universe would appear to greatly outnumber the number of baby universes ever produced by intelligent civilizations , since the tunneling probability for that process to succeed is exceedingly small .",
    "smolin @xcite has proposed that this type of mechanism works and furthermore that the laws of physics ( in the bubble universes ) are like those in our own but with small variations .",
    "then , there would be a darwinian evolution of universes .",
    "universes that produced many black holes would have more children that would inherit their characteristics  with some small variations . soon , most universes would have laws of physics that were fine - tuned to produce the maximum number of black holes .",
    "smolin @xcite points out that this theory is testable , since we can calculate whether small changes in the physical constants would decrease the number of black holes formed . in this picture",
    "we should be near a global maximum in the black hole production rate .",
    "one problem is that the laws of physics that maximize the number of black holes and those that simply maximize the number of main sequence stars may be rather similar , and the laws that maximize the number of main sequence stars might well simply maximize the number of intelligent observers , and the anthropic principle alone would suggest a preference for us observing such laws , even if no baby universes were created in black holes .",
    "another possible problem with this model , pointed out by rothman and ellis @xcite , is that if the density fluctuations in the early universe had been higher in amplitude , this would form many tiny primordial black holes ( presumably more black holes per comoving volume than in our universe ) , so , we well might wonder why the density fluctuations in our universe were so small .",
    "one way out might be that tiny black holes do not form any baby universes , but this seems a bit forced since the de sitter neck formed can be as small as the planck scale or gut scale and it would seem that even primordial black holes could be large enough to produce an infinite number of open bubble universes .",
    "another possibility is the recycling universe of garriga and vilenkin @xcite . in this model",
    "there is a metastable vacuum with cosmological constant @xmath851 , and a true lowest energy vacuum with a cosmological constant @xmath852 .",
    "@xmath851 is at the gut or planck energy scale , while @xmath852 is taken to be the present value of @xmath12 ( as might be the case in a flat-@xmath12 model ) .",
    "as long as @xmath853 , then garriga and vilenkin assert that there is a finite ( but small ) probability per unit four volume that the @xmath852 state could tunnel to form a bubble of @xmath851 state , which could therefore inflate , decaying into bubbles of @xmath852 vacuum , which could recycle forming @xmath851 bubbles , and so forth .",
    "they point out that depending on the coordinate system , a bubble of @xmath852 forming inside a @xmath851 universe could also be seen as a @xmath851 bubble forming inside of a @xmath852 universe .",
    "take two de  sitter spaces , one with @xmath851 and one with @xmath852 , and cut each along a vertical slice ( @xmath854 ) in the embedding space .",
    "they can then be joined along an appropriate hyperbola of one sheet representing a bubble wall , with the @xmath852 universe lying to the @xmath855 side and the @xmath851 universe lying to the @xmath856 side .",
    "slicing along hyperplanes with @xmath857 gives a steady - state coordinate system for a @xmath851 universe in which a bubble of @xmath852 vacuum appears .",
    "slicing along hyperplanes with @xmath858 , however , gives a steady - state coordinate system for a @xmath852 universe in which a bubble of @xmath851 appears .",
    "so , one can find a steady - state coordinate system in which there is a @xmath851 universe , with bubbles of @xmath852 inside it , and bubbles of @xmath851 inside these @xmath852 bubbles , and so forth .",
    "if the roll down is slow , within the @xmath852 bubble as it forms , as in gott s open bubble universe @xcite , then it will have at least 67 @xmath28-folds of inflation with @xmath859 before it falls off the plateau into the absolute minimum at @xmath852 , and this will be an acceptable big bang model which will have the usual big bang properties except that it will eventually be dominated by a lambda term @xmath852 . being bubble universes , they will all be open with negative curvature as in gott s model @xcite but they will be asymptotically open de  sitter models at late times with @xmath48 and @xmath860 .",
    "garriga and vilenkin @xcite wondered whether such a recycling model could be geodesically complete toward the past .",
    "such a outcome , they pointed out , would violate no known theorems and should be investigated .",
    "they hoped to find such a geodesically - complete - to - the - past model so that it could be eternal without a need for a beginning .",
    "however , in the special case , where @xmath861 , one can show that the recycling steady state solution becomes a simple single de  sitter space geometry with @xmath851 and the usual steady - state coordinate system in a single de  sitter space is not geodesically complete to the past .",
    "now take this recycling model where it turns out that one of the @xmath851 bubbles formed inside an @xmath852 bubble inside a @xmath851 region is , in fact , the @xmath851 region that one started out with . in this case",
    ", we would have a multiply connected model such as we are proposing which would include a region of ctcs ( fig .",
    "( if @xmath861 , this model is just the multiply connected de  sitter space we have considered . ) if our multiply connected model was geodesically complete to the past , so would the covering space ( a simply connected garriga - vilenkin model ) be",
    ". if our multiply connected model was geodesically incomplete to the past , so would the covering space ( a simply connected garriga - vilenkin model ) be also . in our model , there would be a strong self - consistency reason for pure retarded potential , whereas in the garriga - vilenkin recycling model",
    ", there would be no such strong reason for it . with pure retarded potentials throughout",
    ", the issue of whether the spacetime was geodesically complete to the past is less compelling , as we have argued above , and our model , having a periodic boundary condition , would not need further boundary conditions , unlike a simply connected recycling model that was geodesically incomplete to the past .",
    "thus , there are a number of models in which baby universes are created which can be converted into models in which the universe creates itself , if one of those created baby universes turns out to be the original universe that one started with .",
    "since these models are all ones in which there are an infinite number of baby universes created , this multiply connected outcome must occur unless the probability for a particular multiple connectivity to exist is exactly zero .",
    "in other words , it should occur , unless it is forbidden by the laws of physics .",
    "given quantum mechanics , it would seem that such multiple connectivities would not be absolutely forbidden , particularly in the planck foam era .",
    "we should note here that , in principle , there might even be solutions that are simply connected in which there was an early region of ctcs bounded to the future by a cauchy horizon followed by an inflationary region giving rise to an infinite number of bubble universes .",
    "the models considered so far have all obeyed the weak energy condition , and these models have all been multiply connected ; in other words , they have a genus of @xmath862 , like a donut , since one of the later baby universes is connected with the original one .",
    "consider an asymptotically flat spacetime with two connected wormhole mouths that are widely separated .",
    "the existence of the wormhole connection increases the genus by one . instead of a flat plane , it becomes a flat plane with a handle . to do this",
    ", the wormhole solution must violate the weak energy condition @xcite .",
    "it must have some negative energy density material , for it is a diverging lens ( converging light rays entering one wormhole mouth , diverge upon exiting the other mouth ) . for a compact two dimensional surface , the integrated gaussian curvature over the surface divided by @xmath863 is equal to @xmath862 minus the genus .",
    "thus , the integrated gaussian curvature over a sphere ( genus=0 ) is @xmath863 , while the integrated gaussian curvature over a donut ( genus=1 ) is zero , and the integrated gaussian curvature over a figure 8 pretzel ( genus=2 ) is @xmath864 .",
    "negative curvature is added each time the genus is increased .",
    "conversely , positive curvature can be added to reduce the genus by @xmath862 . when a donut is cut , so that it resembles a letter `` c '' , the ends of the letter `` c '' are sealed with positive curvature ( two spherical hemispherical caps would do the job , for example ) .",
    "our solutions are already multiply connected , so they might in principle be made simply connected by the addition of some extra positive mass density , without violating the weak energy condition .",
    "an example of this is seen by comparing grant space @xcite with gott s two - string spacetime @xcite .",
    "grant space is multiply connected , has @xmath865 everywhere , and includes ctcs .",
    "it can be pictured as a cylinder .",
    "gott s two - string spacetime is simply connected , but is identical to grant space at large distances from the strings .",
    "it also contains ctcs .",
    "it can be pictured as a cardboard cylinder that has been stepped on and then stapled shut at one end , like an envelope .",
    "there are two corners at the closed end , representing the two strings , but the cylinder continues outward forever toward its open end ( so it is like a test tube , a cylinder closed on one end ) .",
    "the two strings provide positive energy density ( i.e. they do not violate the weak energy condition ) .",
    "ctcs that wrap around the two strings far out in the cylinder ( which is identical to a part of grant space ; see laurence @xcite ) can be shrunken to points by slipping them through the strings  but they become spacelike curves during this process . thus , gott space represents how a multiply connected spacetime with ctcs ( grant space ) can be converted into a simply connected spacetime with ctcs by adding to the solution material that obeys the weak energy condition . a similar thing",
    "might in principle be possible with these cosmological models .",
    "since our multiply connected versions already obey the weak energy condition , so would the associated simply connected versions .",
    "the question of first - cause has been a troubling one for cosmology .",
    "often , this has been solved by postulating a universe that has existed forever in the past .",
    "big bang models supposed that the first - cause was a singularity , but questions about its almost , but not quite , uniformity remained . besides , the big bang singularity just indicated a breakdown of classical general relativity , and with a proper theory - of - everything , one could perhaps push through to earlier times .",
    "inflation has solved some of these problems , but borde and vilenkin have shown that if the initial inflationary state is metastable , then it must have had a finite beginning also .",
    "ultimately , the problem seems to be how to create something out of nothing .",
    "so far , the best attempt at this has been vilenkin s tunneling from nothing model and the similar hartle - hawking no - boundary proposal .",
    "unfortunately , tunneling is , as the name suggests , usually a process that involves tunneling from _ one _ classical state to _ another _ , thus , with the wheeler - dewitt potential and `` energy '' @xmath866 that hartle and hawking adopted , the universe , we argue , should really start not as nothing but as an @xmath1 universe of radius zero  a point .",
    "a point is as close to nothing as one can get , but it is not nothing .",
    "also , how could a point include the laws of physics ?",
    "in quantum cosmology , the wave function of the universe is treated as the solution of a schrdinger - like equation ( the wheeler - dewitt equation ) , where the three - sphere @xmath1 radius @xmath21 is the abscissa and there is a potential @xmath154 with a metastable minimum at @xmath867 , and a barrier with @xmath868 for @xmath869 , and @xmath870 for @xmath871 .",
    "thus , the evolution can be seen as a particle , representing the universe , starting as a point , @xmath127 , at the bottom of the metastable potential well , with @xmath866 .",
    "then it tunnels through the barrier and emerges at @xmath872 with @xmath866 , whereupon it becomes a classically inflating de  sitter solution .",
    "it can then decay via the formation of open single bubble universes @xcite .",
    "the problem with this model is that it ignores the `` zero - point - energy '' .",
    "if there is a conformal scalar field @xmath90 , then the `` energy '' levels should be @xmath873 .",
    "even for @xmath157 there is a `` zero - point - energy '' .",
    "the potential makes the system behave like a harmonic oscillator in the potential well near @xmath127 .",
    "a harmonic oscillator can not sit at the bottom of the potential well  the uncertainty principle would not allow it .",
    "there must be some zero - point - energy and the particle must have some momentum , as it oscillates within the potential well when the field @xmath90 is included .",
    "thus , when the `` zero - point - energy '' is considered , we see that the initial state is not a point but a tiny oscillating ( @xmath874 ) big bang universe , that oscillates between big bangs and big crunches ( though the singularities at the big bangs and big crunches might be smeared by quantum effects ) .",
    "this is the initial classical state from which the tunneling occurs .",
    "it is metastable , so this oscillating universe could not have existed forever : after a finite half - life , it is likely to decay .",
    "it reaches maximum radius @xmath875 , and then tunnels to a classical de  sitter state at minimum radius @xmath876 where @xmath877 .",
    "the original oscillating universe could have formed by a similar tunneling process from a contracting de  sitter phase , but such a phase would have been much more likely to have simply classically bounced to an expanding de  sitter phase instead of tunneling into the oscillating metastable state at the origin . in this case , if one found oneself in an expanding de  sitter phase , it would be much more likely that it was the result of classical bounce from a contracting de  sitter phase , rather than the result of a contracting de  sitter phase that had tunneled to an oscillating phase and then back out to an expanding de  sitter phase .",
    "besides , a contracting de  sitter phase would be destroyed by the formation of bubbles which would percolate before the minimum radius was ever reached .    in this paper , we consider instead the notion that the universe did not arise out of nothing , but rather created itself .",
    "one of the remarkable properties of the theory of general relativity is that in principle it allows solutions with ctcs .",
    "why not apply this to the problem of the first - cause ?",
    "usually the beginning of the universe is viewed like the south pole . asking what is before that is like asking what is south of the south pole ,",
    "it is said .",
    "but as we have seen , there remain unresolved problems with this model .",
    "if instead there were a region of ctcs in the early universe , then asking what was the earliest point in the universe would be like asking what is the easternmost point on the earth .",
    "there is no easternmost point  you can continue going east around and around the earth .",
    "every point has points that are to the east of it .",
    "if the universe contained an early region of ctcs , there would be no first - cause .",
    "every event would have events to its past . and",
    "yet the universe would not have existed eternally in the past ( see fig .",
    "thus , one of the most remarkable properties of general relativity  the ability in principle to allow ctcs  would be called upon to solve one of the most perplexing problems in cosmology .",
    "such an early region of ctcs could well be over by now , being bounded to the future by a cauchy horizon .",
    "we construct some examples to show that vacuum states can be found such that the renormalized energy - momentum tensor does not blow up as one approaches the cauchy horizon .",
    "for such a model to work the universe has to reproduce at some later time the same conditions that obtained at an earlier time .",
    "inflation is particularly useful in this regard , for starting with a tiny piece of inflating state , at later times a huge volume of inflating state is produced , little pieces of which look just like the one we started with . many inflationary models allow creation of baby inflationary universes inside black holes , either by tunneling across the einstein - rosen bridge , or by formation as one approaches the singularity .",
    "if one of these baby universes simply turns out to be the universe we started with , then a multiply connected model with early ctcs bounded by a cauchy horizon is produced .",
    "since any closed null geodesics generating the cauchy horizon must circulate through the optically thick region of the hot big bang phase of the universe after the inflation has stopped , the renormalized energy - momentum tensor should not blow up as the cauchy horizon is approached .    as a particularly simple example we consider a multiply connected de  sitter solution where events e@xmath878 are topologically identified with events e@xmath879 that lie inside these future light cones via a boost transformation .",
    "if the boost @xmath337 , we show that we can find a rindler - type vacuum where the renormalized energy - momentum tensor does not blow up as the cauchy horizon is approached but rather produces a cosmological constant throughout the spacetime which self - consistently solves einstein s equations for this geometry .",
    "thus , it is possible to find self - consistent solutions . when analyzing classical fields in this model , the only self - consistent solution without a blow up as the cauchy horizon is approached occurs when there is a pure retarded potential in the causally connected region of the model .",
    "thus , the multiply connected nature of this model and the possibility of waves running into themselves , ensure the creation of an arrow of time in this model .",
    "this is a remarkable property of this model .",
    "interestingly , this model , although having no earliest event and having some timelike geodesics that are infinitely extendible to the past , is nevertheless geodesically incomplete to the past .",
    "this is not a property we should have thought desirable , but since pure retarded potentials are established automatically in this model , there are no waves propagating to the past and so there may be no problem in physics with this , since there are never any waves that run off the edge of the spacetime .",
    "the region of ctcs has a finite four - volume equal to @xmath880 and should be in a pure vacuum state containing no real particles or hawking radiation and no bubbles . after the cauchy horizon for a certain amount of proper time ( depending on the bubble formation probability per four volume @xmath70 ) no bubbles ( or real particles ) form , but eventually this model expands to infinite volume , creating an infinite number of open bubble universes , which do not percolate . at late times in the de  sitter phase",
    "a particle detector would find the usual hawking radiation just as in the usual vacuum for de  sitter space .",
    "there are a number of problems to be solved in this model .",
    "the chronology projection conjecture proposes that the laws of physics conspire so as to prevent the formation of ctcs .",
    "this conjecture was motivated by hiscock and konkowski s result that the energy - momentum tensor of the adapted minkowski vacuum in misner space diverges as the cauchy horizon is approached .",
    "but as we have shown @xcite , the adapted rindler vacuum for misner space has @xmath881 throughout the space if @xmath337 ; thus , this is a self - consistent vacuum for this spacetime since it solves einstein s equations for this geometry .",
    "it s true that @xmath882 remains formally ill - defined on the cauchy horizon itself [ @xmath348 in eq .",
    "( [ e69 ] ) with @xmath337 ] , a set of measure zero .",
    "but it is not clear that this creates a problem for physics , since continuity might require that this formally ill - defined quantity be defined to be zero on this set of measure zero as well , since it is zero everywhere else . in fact",
    ", a treatment in the euclidean section shows this is the case , for in the euclidean section , if @xmath337 , @xmath881 everywhere , including at @xmath348 .",
    "other counter - examples to the chronology protection conjecture have also been found , as discussed in section v. hawking himself has also admitted that the back - reaction of vacuum polarization does not enforce the chronology protection conjecture .",
    "one of the remarkable properties of general relativity is that it allows , in principle , the formation of event horizons .",
    "this appears to be realized in the case of black holes . just as black hole theory introduced singularities at the end , standard big bang cosmology introduced singularities at the beginning of the universe .",
    "now , with inflation , we see that event horizons should exist in the early universe as well @xcite .",
    "inflationary ideas prompt the suggestion that baby universes may be born .",
    "if one of the baby universes simply turns out to be the one we started with , then we get a model with an epoch of ctcs that is over by now , bounded toward the future by a cauchy horizon . we have argued that the divergence of the energy - momentum tensor as one approaches the cauchy horizon does not necessarily occur , particularly when the cauchy horizon crosses through a hot big bang phase where absorption occurs .    if the energy - momentum tensor does not diverge as the cauchy horizon is approached , other problems must still be tackled .",
    "the classical instability of a cauchy horizon to the future ( a future chronology horizon ) in a spacetime with ctcs is one . but this problem is solved in a world with retarded potentials for a cauchy horizon that occurs to our past ( a past chronology horizon ) and which ends an epoch of ctcs .",
    "it thus seems easier to have a cauchy horizon in the early universe . at the microscopic level",
    ", quantum mechanics appears to allow acausal behavior .",
    "indeed the creation and annihilation of a virtual positron - electron pair can be viewed as creation of a small closed loop , where the electron traveling backward in time to complete the loop appears as a positron .",
    "so , why should the laws of physics forbid time travel globally ?",
    "indeed one of the most remarkable properties of the laws of physics is that although they are time ( cpt ) symmetric , the solutions we observe have an arrow of time and retarded potentials . without this feature of the solutions , acausal behavior",
    "would be seen all the time .",
    "interestingly , in our model , the multiply connected nature of the spacetime geometry forces an arrow of time and retarded potentials .",
    "thus , it is the very presence of the initial region of ctcs that produces the strong causality that we observe later on .",
    "this is a very interesting and unexpected property .",
    "an entropy arrow of time is automatically produced as well , with the region of ctcs in the simplest models sitting automatically in a cold vacuum state , with the universe becoming heated after the cauchy horizon .",
    "recently , cassidy and hawking @xcite have proposed yet another supposed difficulty for ctcs , in that the formally defined entropy appears to diverge to negative infinity as the cauchy horizon is approached . yet , in the early universe this may turn out to be an advantage , since to produce the ordinary entropy arrow of time we observe in the universe today , we must necessarily have some kind of natural low - entropy boundary condition in the early universe @xcite .",
    "this could occur on the cauchy horizon that ends the period of ctcs .",
    "new objections to spacetimes with ctcs can continue to surface , as old problems are put to rest , so it might seem that disproving the chronology protection conjecture would be a tall order .",
    "but , proving that there are no exceptions to the chronology protection conjecture , ever , would seem an equally daunting task .",
    "this is particularly true since we currently do not have either a theory of quantum gravity or a theory - of - everything .",
    "perhaps the most obvious problem with the model we have proposed is that the simplest solutions we have obtained so far are not geodesically complete to the past .",
    "but we may need no boundary condition since we have a periodic boundary condition instead .",
    "this thus may not be a problem in physics if retarded potentials are the only ones allowed . alternatively ,",
    "as garriga and vilenkin have indicated , it would violate no known theorems for some type of recycling universe ( making bubble universes within bubble universes _ ad infinitum _ ) to exist that was geodesically complete to the past .",
    "if such solutions exist , it might be possible to find a solution in which there was an early epoch of ctcs that would be geodesically complete to the past as well by simply identifying an earlier bubble with a later one .",
    "thus , a number of important questions remain , and we would not minimize them . the models presented here , however , do have some interesting and attractive properties , suggesting that this _ type _ of model should be investigated further , and that we _ should _ ask the question :        a. einstein , sitz .",

    "<S> the question of first - cause has troubled philosophers and cosmologists alike . now that it is apparent that our universe began in a big bang explosion , the question of what happened before the big bang arises . </S>",
    "<S> inflation seems like a very promising answer , but as borde and vilenkin have shown , the inflationary state preceding the big bang could not have been infinite in duration  it must have had a beginning also . </S>",
    "<S> where did it come from ? ultimately , the difficult question seems to be how to make something out of nothing . </S>",
    "<S> this paper explores the idea that this is the wrong question  that _ that _ is not how the universe got here . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we explore the idea of whether there is anything in the laws of physics that would prevent the universe from creating itself . </S>",
    "<S> because spacetimes can be curved and multiply connected , general relativity allows for the possibility of closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , tracing backwards in time through the original inflationary state we may eventually encounter a region of ctcs  giving _ no _ first - cause . </S>",
    "<S> this region of ctcs may well be over by now ( being bounded toward the future by a cauchy horizon ) . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate that such models  with ctcs  are _ not _ necessarily inconsistent by demonstrating self - consistent vacuums for misner space and a multiply connected de sitter space in which the renormalized energy - momentum tensor does not diverge as one approaches the cauchy horizon and solves einstein s equations . some specific scenarios ( out of many possible ones ) for this type of model are described . </S>",
    "<S> for example : a metastable vacuum inflates producing an infinite number of ( big - bang - type ) bubble universes . in many of these , </S>",
    "<S> either by natural causes or by action of advanced civilizations , a number of bubbles of metastable vacuum are created at late times by high energy events . </S>",
    "<S> these bubbles will usually collapse and form black holes , but occasionally one will tunnel to create an expanding metastable vacuum ( a baby universe ) on the other side of the black hole s einstein - rosen bridge as proposed by farhi , guth , and guven . </S>",
    "<S> one of the expanding metastable - vacuum baby universes produced in this way simply turns out to be the original inflating metastable vacuum we began with . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a universe with ctcs can be stable against vacuum polarization . and , it can be classically stable and self - consistent if and only if the potentials in this universe are retarded  which gives a natural explanation of the arrow of time in our universe . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the laws of physics may allow the universe to be its own mother .    </S>",
