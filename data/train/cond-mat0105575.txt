    "in typical s - wave superconductors , nonmagnetic impurities are not pair - breaking , and therefore have little effect on either the transition temperature or the superfluid density@xcite .",
    "by contrast , the substitution of a nonmagnetic impurity into a d - wave superconductor is expected to be pair - breaking , and , therefore , should have a significant effect on both . since the cuo@xmath0-based high - temperature superconductors are believed to possess an order parameter with @xmath19 symmetry@xcite",
    ", such an effect should be observable in these materials .",
    "indeed , the substitution of a nonmagnetic impurity such as zn ( or even an insulating impurity such as he , introduced by ion implantation ) in a high - t@xmath20 material such as yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 is now well known to dramatically suppress the zero - temperature superfluid density@xcite and also to have a significant , though lesser , effect on the critical temperature .",
    "this striking behavior has provoked numerous theoretical studies of zn impurities and other nonmagnetic disorder in the cuprate superconductors . for example ,",
    "annett _ et al_@xcite and hirschfeld and goldenfeld@xcite , have shown that the impurity scattering can convert the @xmath21-linear behavior of the low - temperature superfluid density to a @xmath22 behavior , in agreement with experiment .",
    "other workers@xcite have refined the theory so that it now agrees quite well with experiment .",
    "choi@xcite has used a t - matrix formalism to calculate the zn impurity dependence of the superfluid density in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 for various temperatures .",
    "et al_@xcite used a model of dirty d - wave superconductivity to fit the impurity - dependence of the superfluid density in a ndba - based cuprate superconductor .",
    "hettler and hirschfeld@xcite have shown how inhomogeneities in a d - wave order parameter can lead to both strong suppression of superfluid density and enhanced microwave conductivity .",
    "several authors have treated the impurity problem by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equations@xcite for the pairing amplitude , which is position - dependent in a dirty d - wave or s - wave superconductor with a short coherence length .",
    "et al_@xcite used this approach to show that disorder in a 2d s - wave superconductor reduces the effective superfluid density , makes the superfluid inhomogeneous , and even breaks up the 2d layer into superconducting islands .",
    "more recently@xcite , the same authors generalized this approach to d - wave superconductors .",
    "zhitomirsky and walker@xcite showed how spatial fluctuations in the energy gap can reduce t@xmath20 in a d - wave superconductor .",
    "et al_@xcite solved the bogoliubov - de gennes equations with a momentum - dependent pairing interaction to obtain an extended gapless region in the overdoped cuprates , which they connected to a rapid doping - induced decrease of both @xmath23 and superfluid density .",
    "et al_@xcite , using the bogoliubov - de gennes approach for a spatially varying energy gap , found that the superfluid density goes rapidly to zero with increasing zn concentration , while t@xmath20 decreases much more slowly with concentration , in reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "neto@xcite has treated the zn - doped cuprates as a collection of fluctuating stripes modeled as an array of coupled overdamped josephson junctions pinned by impurities , and has used this model to estimate the doping - dependence of the transition temperature .",
    "finally , uemura@xcite has discussed the low - temperature superfluid density in zn - doped cuprates from the point of view of the `` universal correlation '' between @xmath23 and zero - temperature superfluid density in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "as noted by emery and kivelson@xcite , such a connection would exist if @xmath23 were controlled by phase fluctuations rather than by the vanishing of the gap amplitude .",
    "most of these models require a rather elaborate calculation to find the influence of non - magnetic impurities on the superfluid density .",
    "by contrast , the goal of this paper is to analyze the behavior to be expected of a very simple model of the zn - doped cuprate superconductors which can be worked out by intuitively appealing calculations .",
    "although this model is difficult to derive from first principles , it may still be of value , because it can be used to make simple predictions for specific experiments , and to understand trends in those experiments .",
    "the model we study was first described by nachumi _",
    "et al_@xcite , and is sometimes known as the `` swiss cheese '' model . in this model , the zn atoms are assumed to replace the cu atoms substitutionally within the cuo@xmath0 layer , which is believed to be the locus of superconductivity in the cuprate superconductors , and to disrupt the @xmath19 order parameter , producing a region approximately of radius @xmath5 within which the layer is normal .",
    "( here @xmath5 is the zero - temperature in - plane coherence length of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 . )",
    "this disruption is plausible , because @xmath5 is very small in the cuprate superconductors ( probably on the order of 10 - 20 @xmath10 at low temperatures , as discussed further below ) .",
    "indeed , some dramatic experimental evidence supporting both the swiss cheese model and the d - wave order parameter picture has recently been presented by pan _",
    ". these workers showed , using scanning tunneling microscopy , that the gap was significantly suppressed near the zn atoms , and that the density of states of single - particle excitations near the zn atoms exhibited a fourfold symmetry .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend the approach of nachumi _ et al _ by analyzing the swiss cheese model within a simple percolation picture .",
    "our approach differs from that of nachumi _ et al _ by accounting for the connectivity of the superconducting part of the cuo@xmath0 layer .",
    "by contrast , in their approach , the superfluid density is directly proportional to the superconducting area .",
    "the consequences of our approach are easily worked out if we use percolation theory and interpret the cuo@xmath0 layer as an inhomogeneous superconductor with spatially distinct superconducting and normal region .",
    "the resulting variation of superfluid density with zn concentration seems to agree somewhat better with experiment than does the simplest version of the swiss - cheese model .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe our percolation model in detail .",
    "the numerical results following from this model are presented in section iii .",
    "finally , in section iv , we discuss our numerical results , briefly compare them to experiment , and analyze the limitations and predictions of the model .",
    "fig .  1 shows our picture of a single cuo@xmath0 layer in zn - doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , in which a fraction @xmath3 of the cu atoms are replaced at random by zn . within the `` swiss cheese '' model@xcite",
    ", each zn atom completely suppresses superconductivity in a region of area @xmath24 around it .",
    "thus , as @xmath3 increases , a smaller and smaller areal fraction of the cuo@xmath0 plane is superconducting . eventually , for a large enough @xmath3 , the remaining superconducting region is disconnected and the effective superfluid density must vanish .",
    "there are two parameters in our geometrical model : the fraction @xmath3 of in - plane cu atoms which are replaced by zn , and the quantity @xmath25 , which is the ratio of the zero - temperature in - plane coherence length @xmath5 ( evaluated at @xmath6 ) to the cu - cu distance @xmath26 . neither parameter is trivial to determine experimentally . for example , @xmath3 is not necessarily equal to @xmath27 , the _ overall _ fraction of cu atoms which are replaced by zn .",
    "in fact , it is believed that @xmath28 , i.  e. , that all the zn dopant atoms go into the cuo@xmath0 planes @xcite . obviously , the connection between @xmath3 and @xmath27 is important in making quantitative comparisons between theory and experiment .",
    "also , the magnitude of @xmath14 is not universally agreed upon for any value of @xmath29 .",
    "et al_@xcite , for example , quote @xmath30 at @xmath31 and @xmath8 , extrapolating from @xmath32 . since @xmath33 for this value of @xmath29@xcite , this gives @xmath34 .",
    "we shall later discuss the effects of assumptions about @xmath14 on the predictions obtained from this model .      .",
    "to estimate the superfluid density as a function of @xmath3 , we assume that the region more than a distance @xmath5 from any zn atom has a complex conductivity @xmath37 characteristic of a superconductor .",
    "we obtain this conductivity by using the first london equation , as applied to a cuo@xmath0 plane at @xmath6 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the supercurrent density and @xmath40 is the electric field . in gaussian units , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the in - plane penetration depth ( evaluated at @xmath6 ) , and",
    "@xmath43 is the mass and @xmath44 the charge of a cooper pair .",
    "fourier transforming gives @xmath45 , where    @xmath46    with @xmath47 we assume that the region _ within _ a distance @xmath5 of a zn atom is simply a normal metal with frequency - independent conductivity @xmath36 .",
    "clearly , this simple model can only be appropriate for @xmath48 , where @xmath49 . at higher frequencies",
    ", there will be effects arising from the superconducting energy gap , which will produce additional structure in @xmath37 .",
    "also , this inductive form also implies no absorption at low frequencies in the limit @xmath50 . in reality , many of the cuprate superconductors do exhibit low - frequency absorption , even at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "this extra absorption can readily be included within the present model by adding to @xmath35 a parallel normal conductivity .",
    "we have carried out a few calculations including this extra term ; as discussed below , they do not affect the @xmath3-dependent superfluid density .",
    "we may infer the effective superfluid density @xmath18 from an effective london equation @xmath51 which relates the space - averaged current density @xmath52 to the space - averaged electric field @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 is related to @xmath18 through a concentration - dependent generalization of eq .",
    "( 2 ) : @xmath55 in the frequency domain , eqs .",
    "[ eq : london1 ] and [ eq : london2 ] may be written @xmath56 where @xmath15 is the effective complex conductivity .",
    "therefore , @xmath57 and , in order to compute @xmath18 , we need to calculate @xmath58 at sufficiently low frequencies .",
    "the ratio @xmath59 can also be calculated more directly by using a homogeneity property of @xmath60@xcite . in the present context , this property states that @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the effective complex conductivity of a two - component system made up of constituents with conductivities @xmath35 and @xmath36 and in - plane zn concentration @xmath3 _ in a particular geometry _ , and @xmath63 is an arbitrary constant . in effect , homogeneity means that ( for fixed geometry and fixed @xmath3 ) if the conductivities of each constituent are multiplied by a certain factor @xmath64 , the _ effective _ conductivity is multiplied by that same factor @xmath64 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath65 , we get @xmath66 hence , for any @xmath3 , @xmath67 here we have used the fact that @xmath68 , the superfluid density at @xmath6 , is given by @xmath69 , and also the fact that lim@xmath70 .",
    "we have evaluated @xmath18 [ or equivalently , @xmath58 ] by two complementary methods .",
    "the first method is a finite - element technique , and should become very accurate for a sufficiently large numerical sample , given the geometrical assumptions of the model .",
    "we consider an l @xmath72 l region of a cuo@xmath0 plane , assuming that the cu ions sit on a square lattice of lattice constant @xmath26 , and choosing @xmath73 where @xmath74 is an integer .",
    "then , using a random number generator , we replace a fraction @xmath3 of the cu ions by zn .",
    "we then assign conductances @xmath37 or @xmath36 to each bond connecting nearest neighbor cu sites , by the following rule .",
    "if the entire length of the bond is at least a distance @xmath14 from any zn site , it is assigned a conductance @xmath37 ; otherwise , it is assigned @xmath36 .",
    "next , we calculate @xmath58 using a standard technique known as the y-@xmath75 transformation@xcite , which is very efficient and accurate for two - dimensional impedance networks .",
    "this technique is approximate only insofar as it is limited to finite networks .",
    "we call this method the random conductance approach ( rca ) .",
    "our second method for calculating @xmath58 is a simple analytical approximation , the effective medium approximation ( ema)@xcite . for the assumed geometry , this approximation is implemented as follows .",
    "first , we calculate @xmath76 , the areal fraction occupied by the superconducting material , as a function of @xmath3 , using the relation @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the number of zn ions in a plane of area @xmath79 .",
    "this limit is readily evaluated using the relation @xmath80 , with the result @xmath81 given @xmath76 , one can calculate @xmath60 using the standard ema relation for this two - dimensional system , namely , @xmath82 the physically correct solution to this quadratic equation is the one which satisfies im@xmath83 . of course , ideally , the ema is suited for application to a geometry in which the @xmath84 and @xmath79 components are distributed in a symmetrical fashion , whereas here , because of the assumption of excluded area , the @xmath84 and @xmath79 are not distributed symmetrically .",
    "nonetheless , it is a reasonable approximation even for this nonsymmetric geometry .",
    "once @xmath85 has been calculated at a given @xmath3 by either of the methods described above , the effective superfluid density can be inferred from the relation ( [ eq : super ] ) .",
    "we can also compute the ratio @xmath59 directly , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) .",
    "that is , for a given @xmath3 , we decide which are the superconducting bonds , using the method described earlier in this section , and assign these bonds conductances of unity .",
    "the remaining normal bonds are assigned conductances of zero .",
    "the effective conductance is then evaluated using either the ema or the rca , and the ratio @xmath59 is then obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) .",
    "in carrying out the rca calculations , we have generally used a square networks of size ranging from @xmath86 to @xmath87 cu sites . in order to reduce statistical fluctuations ,",
    "the rca results quoted below are averaged over a number of different realizations of the disorder for each @xmath88 and @xmath3 .",
    "these realizations are `` correlated '' in the sense that , for each realization , we increase @xmath3 by adding a few impurities to the configuration of the previous @xmath3 value . in evaluating the ema conductivities ,",
    "no such averaging is necessary , since the approximation can be evaluated analytically in the limit of a very large sample .",
    "our results for @xmath59 are shown in fig .  2 for several choices of the parameter @xmath25 . the full , dashed , dot - dashed , and dotted curves are the ema results .",
    "the diamonds are the results of the rca calculations at @xmath89 , using eq .",
    "( 12 ) , for two correlated realizations of a @xmath87 lattice",
    ". there are several striking features .",
    "first of all , in both methods @xmath59 monotonically decreases with increasing @xmath3 , reaching zero at a percolation threshold @xmath13 which depends on @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , @xmath13 increases with decreasing @xmath25 .",
    "this relationship is not surprising : a larger @xmath25 implies that a larger area is converted from superconducting to normal by a single zn impurity , within this model . also , the ema and rca agree quite well over most of the concentration range , except near the percolation threshold .",
    "the ema percolation threshold always corresponds to @xmath90@xcite .",
    "the rca threshold is higher , because the superconducting fraction remains connected to a somewhat higher fraction of zn than is predicted by the ema .    in figs .  3 and 4",
    ", we show im@xmath91 and re@xmath91 as a function of x at @xmath92 , where @xmath49 and @xmath93 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defa ] ) .",
    "we use using parameters thought to be appropriate for the case @xmath8 , namely , @xmath89@xcite . in both figures ,",
    "the dashed line represents the ema ; the diamonds denote the rca ( average over 20 correlated realizations of a @xmath86 lattice ) and the the open squares are the rca , averaged over 2 realizations of a @xmath87 lattice .",
    "3 shows that im@xmath91 closely mirrors the behavior of @xmath59 shown in fig .  2 , as expected from the homogeneity relations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) .",
    "the apparent percolation threshold is again somewhat larger ( @xmath94 ) in the rca than in the ema ( @xmath95 ) . for values of @xmath3 well below @xmath13 ,",
    "im@xmath96 , like @xmath59 , decreases linearly with @xmath3 .",
    "this linear behavior is well known in the ema@xcite .",
    "4 shows that re@xmath58 has a strong peak occurring near the percolation threshold ( @xmath95 in the ema and @xmath97 within the rca for our choice of @xmath98 ) .",
    "the physical origin of this peak is discussed in the next section .",
    "we believe that the greater half - width of the rca results arises because the calculation is carried out for a finite sample , and also because the average is taken over a number of different realizations , each of which has a slightly different percolation threshold for these finite samples . in support of this picture ,",
    "note that the rca half - width is smaller for the larger ( @xmath87 ) samples , for which these fluctuations should be smaller .",
    "the slight random fluctuations in these curves as a function of @xmath3 are , we believe , also due to these finite - size effects . by contrast , the ema results are obtained analytically for an effectively infinite sample ; so these finite - size fluctuations play no role . note that , even for a @xmath99 sample , there are still only 375 impurities at @xmath100 ; so these fluctuations are still significant in the rca .    in fig .  5 , we show re@xmath91 for @xmath101 , once again using @xmath34 , as calculated in the ema and in the rca for two different sample sizes .",
    "the ema peak is clearly stronger for @xmath101 than @xmath92 .",
    "the rca peak is also stronger , especially for the larger sample where the peak height is not washed out by finite size effects .",
    "the apparent double peak for the @xmath87 sample is , we believe , just the result of finite - size fluctuations , which are magnified at such low frequencies where the conductivity contrast @xmath102 is larger .    finally , we have calculated @xmath91 within the ema for the same model as before , again with @xmath34 , but a slightly different choice for @xmath37 .",
    "namely , we write @xmath103 where we arbitrarily choose @xmath104 .",
    "the motivation behind this choice is that , in a material such as , which is believed to have an order parameter with @xmath19 symmetry , the in - plane conductivity is expected to have a quasiparticle contribution , even at very low temperatures .",
    "the additional term @xmath105 is a crude way of modeling this contribution .",
    "the resulting re@xmath58 is plotted versus @xmath3 at @xmath106 , both for the model ( [ eq : sigs1 ] ) and for a purely inductive @xmath107 .",
    "clearly , the peak near @xmath13 is little affected by the change , but there is now , in addition , some extra contribution to re@xmath58 for @xmath108 .",
    "although this extra contribution to @xmath35 does slightly change re@xmath58 at finite @xmath88 , the homogeneity relations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) imply that it has no effect on @xmath18 , either in the ema or in the rca .",
    "it is of interest to compare our calculated values of @xmath13 with the experimentally observed critical concentration for yba@xmath0(cu@xmath109zn@xmath20)@xmath1o@xmath2 at @xmath8 .",
    "the critical value of @xmath27 is between @xmath110 and @xmath111@xcite ( probably closer to @xmath111 , judging from in - plane resistivity measurements@xcite ) , as compared to our calculated critical value @xmath94 for this @xmath29 [ cf .",
    "fig .  2 ] . but a direct comparison of these values is difficult : the in - plane zn concentration may differ from @xmath27 .",
    "if in fact @xmath28 , as mentioned above , then our model seems to underestimate @xmath13 ; the underestimate is less in the rca than in the more approximate ema .",
    "but this apparent discrepancy in @xmath13 may not be very significant , for two reasons .",
    "first , @xmath13 is quite sensitive to the parameter @xmath98 : a change of @xmath14 only from @xmath112 to @xmath113 increases @xmath13 by more than a factor of 2 in the ema , and presumably by a similar amount in the rca .",
    "as already mentioned , this parameter is not known experimentally with great precision .",
    "secondly , our model assumes that the cuo@xmath0 layer undergoes an _ discontinuous _ change from s to n character at a distance @xmath14 from a zn impurity .",
    "it would be more realistic to assume a gradual change .",
    "although such a transition region might be difficult to include in the present model , its qualitative effect would probably be to reduce the effective radius of the normal region to a value smaller than @xmath14 .",
    "such a reduction would , according to our results , _ increase _ @xmath13 , making it closer to the reported value@xcite .",
    "it is of interest to compare the present model to several others in the literature . in the original model of nachumi _",
    "et al_@xcite , the superfluid density is proportional to the superconducting areal fraction , i.  e. , to the fraction of the cuo@xmath0 plane which is more than a distance @xmath5 from any zn impurity .",
    "the present model improves on the implementation of this swiss cheese model by taking into account effects of connectivity of the superconducting parts .",
    "this treatment is consistent with the generalized london equation [ eq .  ( 5 ) ] . in another class of models ( see , e.  g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath18 is calculated using the bogoliubov - de gennes equation with some form of static disorder .",
    "this model , like the swiss - cheese model , also leads to a spatially varying gap function or pairing potential .",
    "although this model seems quite different from ours , we speculate that both actually have much of the same physical content .",
    "the difference is that in the models of refs .",
    "@xcite , the disorder is on an atomic scale and treated microscopically , whereas in the present case the disorder is on a greater length scale and treated within continuum electrodynamics . nonetheless , both lead to surprisingly similar behavior ( superfluid density diminishing rapidly with increasing @xmath3 and vanishing at a critical concentration ) .",
    "we do not know how to connect the two on a more rigorous basis , however .",
    "a nontrivial prediction of the present model is the existence of a peak in re@xmath85 near @xmath13 .",
    "if such a peak were observed in experiments , it could be viewed as strong evidence in favor of the present model .",
    "this `` percolation peak '' is reminiscent of the well - known fluctuation peak in re@xmath114 near t@xmath20 in a homogeneous superconductor , but there are significant differences in the underlying physics .",
    "the fluctuation peak results from slow motions of superconducting fluctuations with size of order @xmath115 .",
    "the spatial extent of these fluctuations diverges near @xmath23 , as does the time scale on which they move ; this diverging time scale leads to a strong low - frequency peak in the conductivity .",
    "by contrast the percolation peak involves motion of charge carriers through a _",
    "static _ disordered structure ; the frequency - dependence arises from the slow motion of these charges through the weakly connected structure ( but _ static _ structure of superconductor that exists , in our model , near the @xmath116 ( or @xmath13 ) .",
    "the characteristic length for this structure is the so - called percolation correlation length @xmath117 , which diverges near @xmath116 on both sides of the percolation transition@xcite .",
    "the existence of this percolation peak can be understood from the following crude argument . on the normal metal side of the percolation threshold , the static d.  c.",
    "conductivity is finite , but should diverge as @xmath118 .",
    "this divergence is due to the ever - larger superconducting regions , which come closer and closer to shorting out the voltage across the normal metal as @xmath116 is approached .",
    "this divergence should disappear as the frequency is increased , because the contrast in conductivities between superconducting and normal regions will become much smaller in absolute value ( that is , the ratio @xmath119 should approach unity ) .",
    "therefore , at a fixed @xmath76 just above @xmath116 ( that is , on the normal metal side ) , re@xmath120 , should show a strong maximum at @xmath121 , and this maximum should diverge as @xmath118 .",
    "since @xmath122 should vary continuously across the percolation threshold , except at exactly @xmath121 , we expect the same behavior on the superconducting side of the threshold .",
    "this is qualitatively the behavior we see in both our ema and rca results .",
    "the behavior of this `` critical peak '' can be estimated from the standard scaling theory of the percolation threshold ( see , for example , ref .",
    "this scaling approach is based on the assumption that the percolation threshold is a critical point described by a single diverging length @xmath117 ; if that assumption is correct , then the scaling approach is believed to be exact . as applied to the present model , and using the homogeneity relations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) .",
    "this scaling approach dictates that @xmath60 have the form @xmath123 where @xmath124 , and @xmath125 and @xmath126 are standard percolation exponents .",
    "the function @xmath127 of the complex variable @xmath128 has the limiting behaviors @xcite @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 where @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 are constants .",
    "this form implies that precisely at @xmath135 both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath60 satisfy @xmath136    in conventional 2d percolation theory , @xmath137 ; so both re@xmath138 and im@xmath138 would be proportional to @xmath139 .",
    "the present `` swiss cheese '' model may not , however , be in the same universality class as percolation on a lattice . instead",
    ", it may fall into the class of certain continuum percolation models@xcite . in the present case",
    ", the exponent @xmath126 and @xmath125 should have the values corresponding to another `` swiss cheese '' model in 2d , in which the area between the holes is conducting while the holes are insulating .",
    "according to the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite , the swiss cheese @xmath126 and @xmath125 are , in fact , unchanged from their lattice values of 1.3 in two dimensions .",
    "therefore , one still expects that both re@xmath138 and i m @xmath138 should have a @xmath139 frequency dependence in this model .",
    "it is also of interest to consider the predictions of the present model regarding the _ critical current density _",
    "@xmath140 in zn - doped . in this case",

    "the critical exponent @xmath143 is estimated as @xmath144 for swiss cheese in @xmath145 dimensions , where @xmath146 is the percolation correlation length exponent defined by @xmath147 .",

    "is predicted to go to zero near the percolation threshold even more rapidly than does @xmath18 .",
    "it would be of interest if this prediction could be tested experimentally .",
