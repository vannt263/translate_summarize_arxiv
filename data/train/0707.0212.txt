    "the spectacular performance of the two asymmetric b - factories is a triumph of accelerator science .",
    "both machines appreciably exceeded their designed luminosities and presently have delivered over 1 ab@xmath5 of data  @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , the first crucial result is a striking confirmation of ckm  paradigm  @xcite of flavor and cp violation .",
    "it is clear that the ckm phase provides the dominant explanation for the observed cp violation to an accuracy of about 10 - 15% .",
    "this strongly suggests that new physics most likely can only show up as a perturbation requiring accurate measurements and precise theoretical calculations .    on the other hand , many b - factory results indicate interesting deviations from the sm .",
    "one of the most compelling hints of new physics are the measurements of the time - dependent cp asymmetries in penguin dominated modes that turned out to be systematically smaller than the sm expectation .",
    "while the calculation of these asymmetries requires to keep under control long distance qcd effects , the qcd factorization as well as several other approaches shows that some of the modes are extremely clean ( _ i.e. _ @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath8 @xmath8 final states ) .",
    "the magnitude of the deviation ranges from 2.5@xmath0 to about 4@xmath0 depending on how one chooses to compare .",
    "the amplitudes for these decays are dominated by penguin ( _ i.e. _ short distance ) contributions : hence , deviations in these cp asymmetries are expected and quite natural in a very wide class of new physics scenarios .",
    "it is therefore extremely important to follow this issue very closely .",
    "unfortunately a sizable reduction of the experimental errors on these asymmetries requires significantly greater statistics and is bound to be slow : the projected doubling of the integrated luminosity by the end of 2008 is unlikely to resolve this issue in a decisive fashion . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", it would be extremely desirable to reduce the experimental uncertainties at the 5% level because a standard model irreducible pollution of a few percents is expected .",
    "the needed luminosity for this important enterprise may have to await the advent of a super - b factory  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this hint for new physics there are several other measurements that deviate sizably from the respective sm expectations . among those we have the muon anomalous magnetic moment ,",
    "difference in direct cp asymmetries in @xmath9 decays and the tension between @xmath10 and the time - dependent cp asymmetry in @xmath11 . in this paper",
    ", we present an extensive discussion of several important experimental hints for deviations from the sm . as an illustration we study how a simple and well motivated extension of the sm ( the top two higgs doublet model  @xcite ) can handle the experimental data .    needless to say ,",
    "the deviations seen in b decays  @xcite and some other aspects of flavor physics , may also be accountable by many other extensions of the sm ; for example supersymmetry  @xcite , a fourth family  @xcite , a z - penguin  @xcite , warped flavor - dynamics  @xcite etc . clearly , the key features of any beyond the standard model scenario that is to account for the experimental deviations in b - physics and other flavor physics that are being discussed here are that it has to have at least one new cp - odd phase and new particles in the @xmath2 300 gev to @xmath2 few tev range . much more experimental information is required to disentangle the various possibilities .    in sec .",

    "in this section we summarize some of the experimental problems that have surfaced in the past few years connected with the standard model picture of flavor physics .",
    "in particular we focus on the tension between the measured time dependent cp asymmetry in @xmath11 and the rest of the unitarity triangle fit , the discrepancy between cp asymmetries in @xmath12 ( _ e.g. _ @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath11 ) transitions , the difficulties in describing the cp asymmetries in the decays @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath17 .",
    "the standard unitarity triangle fit , with the inclusion of the constraints from @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 predicts @xmath23 .",
    "here , we used a simple @xmath24 fit in which we use the inputs given in table  [ tab : ut_inputs_intro ] and assume that all errors are gaussian ( this means , for instance , that we combine systematic and statistical errors in quadrature ) . the direct determination of this asymmetry via the  gold - plated `` @xmath25 modes ' ' yields  @xcite @xmath26 and deviates from the sm prediction by about two standard deviations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chism ] we show the sm fit of the unitarity triangle in the @xmath27 plane and the @xmath18 constraint is superimposed . from the figure it is clear that this effect is mainly due to the conflict between @xmath18 and @xmath10 .",
    "note also that the former measurement is clean from hadronic uncertainties and the latter uses basically a tree  level process .    in order to test the stability of this 2@xmath0 effect , it is useful to entertain a scenario in which the errors on @xmath19 and on the su(3 ) breaking ratio obtained by lattice calculations @xmath28 are increased .",
    "increasing @xmath29 ( from about 7% ) and @xmath30 ( from 3 - 4% ) , the prediction for @xmath31 does not change much : we find @xmath32 .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the impact of the very recent lattice determination of @xmath33 presented in ref .",
    "@xcite : using @xmath34 , the fit gets slightly worse and the prediction for @xmath35 reads @xmath36 .",
    "the conclusion of these exercises is that the strain between the direct determination of @xmath18 and the rest of the unitarity triangle fit is quite solid  @xcite .",
    "-0.7 cm      within the sm , the cp asymmetries in penguin dominated @xmath38 transitions such as @xmath6 and @xmath39 are equal to @xmath40 up to penguin polluting effects , that are expected to be fairly small in these modes  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of matrix elements of penguin operators is an intrinsically non  perturbative task , and it has been recently studied using many different approaches  @xcite .",
    "these studies show that while a precise calculation of hadronic uncertainties is very difficult , at least three cases , namely @xmath41 , @xmath6 and @xmath42  @xcite are notably clean with only a few percent contaminations . in many other cases",
    "rough estimates  ( see for instance refs .",

    "the latter deviates from the sm prediction @xmath49 at the two sigma level .",
    "it is rather curious that all the time dependent cp asymmetries in @xmath12 have been measured to be somewhat smaller than the @xmath11 asymmetry .",
    "if we naively compute the average of the cp asymmetries in all the @xmath12 modes , even though only three of the modes are very clean and others may have @xmath50 uncertainties , one then finds @xmath51_{\\rm average } = 0.52 \\pm 0.05 $ ] with a deviation of about 4@xmath0 from the sm prediction and about 3@xmath0 from the value directly measured by the @xmath25 method .    for the sake of completion",
    ", we also note that just averaging over the three clean modes gives @xmath52 .",
    "since in so far as the sm is concerned , @xmath53 may be measured either by these three clean penguin modes or by the @xmath54 modes , the best `` sm '' direct measurement of @xmath55 is given by the average over the @xmath56 modes : we thus find @xmath57 which is again about 2.5@xmath0 from the sm prediction of @xmath58 .",

    "thanks to the spectacular performance of the two asymmetric b - factories , intensive studies in the last few years have demonstrated that the cp and flavor violation observed in b and k physics is described by the standard ckm mechanism to an accuracy of about 15% . a very interesting result , potentially one of the most important discovery made at the b - factories , is that the time dependent cp - asymmetries in penguin dominated modes do not seem to agree with the sm expectations . at the moment these deviations are in the 2.5 - 3.5@xmath0 ranges",

    "the model is a simple extension of the sm which in a natural way accounts for the very heavy top mass .",
    "we view it as an interesting low energy effective model that encompasses some of the important features of an underlying framework of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "of course , the deviations seen in b decays and other flavor physics , may also be accountable by many other extensions of the sm ; for example supersymmetry  @xcite , a fourth family  @xcite , a z - penguin  @xcite or warped flavor - dynamics  @xcite .",
    "obviously , the main features of any extension of the standard model that is to account for the experimental deviations in b - physics and other flavor physics that are discussed here are that there have to be new particles in the @xmath2 300 gev to @xmath2 few tev range and associated with these one needs at least one new cp - odd phase .",
    "distinguishing between various scenarios or nailing down the precise structure of some other models responsible for the deviations that we have discussed will undoubtedly require much more experimental information .",
    "in any case if the hints from the b - factories are really true , we will certainly witness a truly exciting era in particle physics as the lhc starts its long awaited operations in 2008 .",

    "<S> nevertheless , as more data were accumulated , deviations in the 2.5 - 3.5 @xmath0 range have emerged pointing to the exciting possibility of new cp - odd phase(s ) and flavor violating parameters in b - decays . </S>",
    "<S> primarily this seems to be the case in the time dependent cp asymmetries in penguin dominated modes ( e.g. @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these and other deviations from the sm and , as an illustration of possible new physics scenarios , we examine the role of the top two higgs doublet model . </S>",
    "<S> this is a simple extension of the sm obtained by adding second higgs doublet in which the yukawa interactions of the two higgs doublets are assigned in order to naturally account for the large top - quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> of course , many other extensions of the standard model could also account for these experimental deviations . </S>",
    "<S> clearly if one takes these deviations seriously then some new particles in the @xmath2 300 gev to @xmath2 few tev with associated new cp - odd phase(s ) are needed .    </S>",
