    "recently results have been presented which allow a test of the hypothesis made long ago @xcite that strange particle production could be providing key information about the formation and properties of the qgp phase in relativistic heavy ion collisions at cern ( 160200 gev a ) and/or ags ( 1015 gev a ) energies .",
    "a strong enhancement of all strange particle yields relative to proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions has been well documented  the more specific strange antibaryon enhancement is reported at central rapidity by the wa85/94 @xcite and na35 @xcite collaborations in 200 gev a collisions of sulphur nuclei with various nuclear targets .    in the picture of sudden hadronization of the qgp fireball , as well as",
    "when strange particles are made in radiative / recombination formation on the surface during expansion , the light quark fugacity determines the particle ratios .",
    "if during the final state hadronization a full re - equilibration occurs , then the memory of the qgp would be largely lost  except that under certain conditions the excess entropy produced in such events leaves a characteristic trace . however",
    ", a phenomenological analysis @xcite of data taken at 200 gev a suggests that we have a very favorable situation in this case : the particle flow results suggest strongly that the picture of a rapidly disintegration central fireball applies , and the emitted particles carry in this case information about properties of the primordial qgp state .    given this observation",
    ", we have here as objective to develop a first - principle model that would allow to describe current data .",
    "what is needed is a condition which would express how much nuclear matter can be compressed in the collision as the constituents thermalize .",
    "we elaborate here on the experimental consequences of the proposal we made before @xcite that the condition of balance between the thermal pressure of the deconfined quarks and gluons and the dynamical compression exerted by the in - flowing nuclear matter during the interpenetration of the projectile and the target is determining the conditions at particle freeze - out .",
    "the tacit assumption of rapid thermal equilibration in primary interactions introduces almost 70% of the final state entropy into the initial state .",
    "this entropy manifests itself later as the multiplicity of produced particles .",
    "our approach associates this initial entropy content with certain initial statistical conditions . a study undertaken specifically to understand",
    "if the initial state assumptions are impacting the final state @xcite has shown that the crucial parameter is , for a thermally isolated system , the fireball energy per baryon .",
    "using applicable equations of state the dependence of @xmath0 on the statistical parameters is determined .",
    "on the other hand , introducing the stopping fractions of energy @xmath1 and baryon number @xmath2 we obtain : @xmath3 where the last equality assumes that both stopping fractions are equal  this we believe to be a reasonable assumption for the current experimental domain .",
    "@xmath4 is the number of nucleons participating in the reaction . in consequence ,",
    "the energy per baryon in the fireball is to be taken as being equal to the kinematic energy available in the collision . in the present day experiments we have the following conditions : for au  au at ags",
    " @xmath5 gev , for s ",
    "w / pb at cern @xmath6 gev and for pb  pb at cern  @xmath7 gev .",
    "after the initial thermalization occurred , the internal pressure of the fireball will be determined considering balance between the thermal pressure of a quark - gluon plasma and the dynamical compression exerted by the in - flowing matter , augmented by the external vacuum pressure .",
    "we employ perturbative qcd , qgp - equation of state with thermal masses .",
    "aside of the temperature @xmath8 we encounter the different ( quark and gluon ) fugacities @xmath9 and the chemical saturation factors @xmath10 for each particle . for the vacuum pressure we will use @xmath11 .",
    "the pressure due to kinetic motion follows from well - established principles , and we obtain : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the normal nuclear density and it is understood that the energy @xmath14 and the momentum @xmath15 are given in the nucleon ",
    "nucleon cm frame and @xmath16 is the momentum stopping fraction  only this fraction @xmath17 of the incident cm momentum can be used by a particle incident on the central fireball ( the balance remains in the un - stopped longitudinal motion ) in order to exercise dynamical pressure . for a target transparent to the incoming flow , there would obviously be no pressure exerted .",
    "given values of @xmath14 and @xmath16 , as well as taking @xmath18 we have prescribed a particular energy per baryon in the fireball and we can concurrently solve the pressure equilibrium constraint eq.([pbal ] ) .",
    "these two conditions allow to determine two initial statistical parameters .",
    "we choose these to be the temperature @xmath19 and the initial value of quark fugacity @xmath20 .",
    "because the qgp phase is strangeness neutral we have @xmath21 .",
    "during the time the nuclei interact , we evolve the fireball statistical parameters at constant pressure and energy per baryon .",
    "we need not to establish a time scale for the change in time of both @xmath22 and @xmath23 as we assume that it occurs at equal rate .",
    "we also take that the strange quark chemical relaxation constant is about 7 times smaller than the one for light quarks  hence while the values of the chemical occupancy factors for light quarks ( @xmath24 ) and gluons ( @xmath25 ) approach chemical equilibrium , for the strange quarks @xmath26 . in the final evolution step , which occurs in our approach",
    "after the collision has ended , thus for proper times @xmath27fm / c , but probably also at @xmath28 35 fm / c , we relax the strange quarks ( near ) to their equilibrium abundance , and the temperature drops to the value @xmath29  we presume that while this last stage of the temporal evolution occurs , the entropy of the light quarks and gluons remains nearly constant .    in fig.[fig1qm95 ]",
    "we show the behavior of temperature @xmath29 and the light quark fugacity @xmath20 at the time of full chemical equilibration , as function of the fireball energy content @xmath0 ( energy per nucleon in the cm frame ) .",
    "it is believed that in current 200 gev experiments @xmath30 while at the lower ags energies @xmath31 .",
    "the range of the possible values as function of @xmath32 is indicated by showing in fig.[fig1qm95 ] results for @xmath33 ( solid line ) , 0.5 ( dot - dashed line ) and 0.25 ( dashed line ) .",
    "these results are in quantitative agreement with present day experiments as is indicated by the vertical error lines drawn in fig.[fig1qm95 ] .",
    "our simple model thus spans correctly the large variation domain of the statistical fireball parameters as function of collision energy and stopping power .      assuming direct hadronization of qgp , we compute the resulting particle ratios for @xmath33 , applicable to the collisions of heaviest nuclei . for the strange antibaryons",
    "the three most interesting ratios are : @xmath34 these are displayed in the fig.[fig2qm95 ] ; in [ fig2qm95]*a * for the entire range of @xmath35 , in [ fig2qm95]*b * for particles with @xmath36 gev and in [ fig2qm95]*c * for particles with @xmath37 gev .",
    "we encounter in all cases the remarkable behavior that all these three ratios increase as the collision energy is reduced ( for not full chemical equilibrium , multiply each ratio with the value of @xmath38 ) .",
    "we further note that with rising strangeness content the ratios shown in fig.[fig2qm95 ] get bigger , the ratios at fixed @xmath39 are all greater than unity .",
    "we have also computed the absolute yields of these particles .",
    "they drop rapidly with energy  at ags the yield is typically a factor 100 smaller compared to sps energies .",
    "we have developed a simple dynamical model allowing to determine in a systematic fashion the conditions reached in high density matter generated in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we analyzed here the situation assuming the qgp equation of state of dense matter .",
    "comparison of our results for a reasonable choice of residual and kinematic parameters with the observed properties in and si  au collisions shows a high degree of quantitative agreement between our qgp - fireball model and the experimental results .",
