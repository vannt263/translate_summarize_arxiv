    "one of the most fascinating possibilities is that generic asymptotically free gauge theories have magnetic duals .",
    "in fact , in the late nineties , in a series of ground breaking papers seiberg @xcite provided strong support for the existence of a consistent picture of such a duality within a supersymmetric framework .",
    "supersymmetry is , however , quite special and the existence of such a duality does not automatically imply the existence of nonsupersymmetric duals .",
    "one of the most relevant results put forward by seiberg has been the identification of the boundary of the conformal window for supersymmetric qcd as function of the number of flavors and colors .",
    "the dual theories proposed by seiberg pass a set of mathematical consistency relations known as t hooft anomaly conditions @xcite .",
    "another important tool has been the knowledge of the all - orders supersymmetric beta function @xcite    recently we provided several analytic predictions for the conformal window of nonsupersymmetric gauge theories using different approaches @xcite .",
    "we also initiated in @xcite the exploration of the possible existence of truly qcd nonsupersymmetric gauge dual providing a consistent picture of the phase diagram as function of number of colors and flavors .",
    "arguably the existence of a possible dual of a generic nonsupersymmetric asymptotically free gauge theory able to reproduce its infrared dynamics must match the t hooft anomaly conditions @xcite .",
    "we have exhibited several solutions of these conditions for qcd in @xcite .",
    "an earlier exploration already appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "the novelty with respect to these earlier results were : i ) the request that the gauge singlet operators associated to the magnetic baryons should be interpreted as bound states of ordinary baryons @xcite ; ii ) the fact that the asymptotically free condition for the dual theory matches the lower bound on the conformal window obtained using the all - orders beta function @xcite .",
    "these extra constraints help restricting further the number of possible gauge duals without diminishing the exactness of the associate solutions with respect to the t hooft anomaly conditions .    in this paper",
    "we analyze theories with fermions transforming according to higher dimensional representations .",
    "some of these theories have been used to construct sensible extensions of the standard model of particle interactions of technicolor type passing precision data and known as minimal walking technicolor models @xcite .",
    "other interesting studies of technicolor dynamics making use of higher dimensional representations appeared in @xcite .",
    "these are the only known extension of technicolor type possessing the smallest naive @xmath1 parameter while being able to display simultaneously ( near ) conformal behavior .",
    "one can also construct explicit examples of extended technicolor interactions @xcite for these models @xcite .",
    "we will exhibit here novel solutions to the t hooft anomaly conditions for theories with higher dimensional representations .",
    "the resuling _",
    "magnetic _ dual allows to predict the critical number of flavors above which the asymptotically free theory , in the electric variables , enters the conformal regime as predicted using the all - orders conjectured beta function @xcite .",
    "several analytic predictions for the lower end of the conformal window for nonsupersymmetric gauge theories with matter transforming according to various @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 representations have been made @xcite .",
    "here we show that using _",
    "exact _ anomaly matching conditions together with the new constraints coming from operator matching introduced in @xcite we arrive at a bound on the conformal windows in agreement with earlier analysis . in particular we find our results to agree with the ones obtained using the all - orders beta function conjecture when assuming the maximum anomalous dimension of the fermion mass to be unity .",
    "an interesting result , stemming from the restriction that the magnetic baryons have baryonic charges which are multiple of the ordinary baryons , is that the duals prefer to feature magnetic fermions transforming according to the fundamental representation of the dual gauge group .",
    "we begin our analysis by investigating an @xmath5 gauge theory with fermionic matter in the two - index symmetric representation of the gauge group .",
    "the interest for this theory resides in the fact that it has been used to construct models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "it is also being studied via first principle lattice simulations .",
    "we first investigate the possible duals with fermions in the defining representation of the dual gauge group and then analyze the case in which the magnetic fermions transform according to the same higher dimensional representation .",
    "we find that operator matching privileges the former duals . here",
    "the various consistency conditions indicate the lower bound of the conformal window must start already for two dirac flavors .",
    "the results are in surprising agreement with the ones derived using the all - orders beta function with an anomalous dimension of the fermion mass near unity , and as well as the ones first predicted in @xcite and obtained via the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) approximation @xcite .",
    "we then investigate @xmath6 gauge theories with adjoint weyl matter .",
    "here we find that an interesting dual is an @xmath7 gauge theory with @xmath8 weyl fermions in the vector representation .",
    "in this case the number of weyl fermoins above which we expect conformality to set in is @xmath9 , corresponding to exactly @xmath10 dirac flavors .",
    "this result is in agreement with analytical @xcite and first principle lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "our results can be further tested via first principle lattice simulations and strongly reduce the number of possible gauge theories one can use to construct models of nature given that the underlying dynamics of superficially distinct models may be related , in the infrared , by a gauge duality .",
    "currently the conformal windows of exactly the theories investigated here , as well as the one investigated in @xcite , are object of intense analytic @xcite and numerically oriented @xcite investigations .",

    "it may happen , in fact , that chiral symmetry breaking is triggered for a value of the anomalous dimension less than two . if this occurs the conformal window shrinks .",
    "the ladder approximation approach , for example , predicts that chiral symmetry breaking occurs when the anomalous dimension is larger than one .",

    "hence there is only one value of @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath81 for which both anomalies are relevant .",
    "we have found different solutions to the anomaly matching conditions which we will present the :      the solutions correspond , for the case @xmath44 to the following value assumed by the indices and @xmath70 baryonic charge : @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 integer numbers and @xmath86 we have asked that both anomaly matching conditions are satisfied for @xmath87 and that the solutions satisfy also the quadratic one for @xmath88 .",
    "of course @xmath53 must assume a value strictly larger than one otherwise it describes an abelian gauge theory .",

    "i.e. : @xmath91 this value _ coincides _ with the one predicted by means of the all - orders conjectured beta function for the lowest bound of the conformal window , in the _ electric _ variables , when taking the anomalous dimension of the mass to be @xmath92 .",
    "we recall that for any number of colors @xmath93 the all orders beta function requires the critical number of flavors to be larger than : @xmath94 for n=3 the two expressions yield @xmath95 .",
    "actually given that @xmath53 must be larger than one this solution requires @xmath96 rather than @xmath95 .",
    "this last feature was also observed for the qcd dual case .",
    "we simply consider this as a signal that we can not arrive at the maximum value of @xmath97 , nevertheless we can still arrive at a value for the anomalous dimension larger than one according to this solution . if one requires an even more stringent constraint @xmath98 we then find @xmath99 which is very close to the result obtained setting @xmath100 in the all - orders beta function .",

    "one can also consider the case @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",

    "we recall that for any number of colors @xmath93 the all orders beta function requires the critical number of flavors to be larger than : @xmath116 for n=3 the two expressions yield @xmath117 .",
    "this value is even closer to the one obtained imposing the condition @xmath112 which is circa @xmath118 .",
    "interestingly the two class of solutions suggest that the electric theory is not conformal but walking .",
    "we observe that the predictions from the dual theory does _ not _ depend on the all orders beta function .",
    "however it is remarkable that the predictions are very close to the ones predicted using the beta function ansatz .",
    "an interesting property of this solution is that one can saturate the anomaly matching conditions directly via the presumed magnetic quarks .",
    "it is , in fact , sufficient to set @xmath119 to see this .",
    "if we apply the all - order beta function we can investigate when chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "setting @xmath100 for the dual theory one finds that @xmath8 should be less than or equal to about @xmath118 which is lower than the value for which the electric theory looses asymptotic freedom . this seems to indicate that more matter is needed and the solution @xmath120 is not an exact dual according to the all orders beta function .",
    "however one can investigate the nonperturbative dynamics of this theory via first principle lattice simulations and test the duality independently .",
    "we have investigated also the case in which the magnetic quarks are in the same two - index representation of the gauge group @xmath122 . in this case the first coefficient of both anomalies must be modified according to @xmath123 to take into account of the change of the representation of the dual quarks .",
    "we have found several solutions for different integer values of the coefficients @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath124 .",
    "we present two examples here for @xmath44 :      @xmath128    with @xmath84 and @xmath85 integer numbers and @xmath129    the one - loop coefficient of the beta function is : @xmath130 asymptotic freedom requires the previous coefficient to be positive which means : @xmath131 the lower bound is now close to the value of the critical number of flavors corresponding to the maximum extension ( @xmath132 ) value where the all orders beta function requires the electric theory to start developing an irfp .",
    "this time the condition @xmath112 yields a weaker constraint , i.e. @xmath133 , with respect to the asymptotic freedom constraint on the lowest value for @xmath8 .",

    "we were able to find a solution for different values of @xmath55 , in particular for @xmath143 the condition @xmath141 is consistent with the bound of the all orders beta function but for @xmath41 and asymptotic freedom requires @xmath144 .    for duals with _",

    "we have found solutions matching the predictions coming from the conjectured all orders beta function also in the case of theories with fermions in the two - index symmetric representation of the @xmath5 gauge group .",
    "moreover if one uses dual quarks in the fundamental representation the typical size of the allowed conformal window is consistent with the @xmath41 condition . on the other hand ,",
    "when using dual quarks in the two - index symmetric representation the size of the conformal window compatible with t hooft anomaly matching can extend to match the one obtained using @xmath92 in the all orders beta function .",

    "we argued that , if the duals exist , they are gauge theories with fermions transforming according to the defining representation of the dual gauge group .",
    "the resulting conformal windows match the one stemming from the all - orders beta function results when taking the anomalous dimension of the fermion mass to be unity .",
    "in particular our results for the adjoint representation indicate that for two dirac flavors any @xmath6 gauge theory should enter the conformal window .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with numerical and previous analytical results @xcite .",
    "the mapping of higher dimensional representations into duals with fermions in the fundamental representation can be the source of the observed universality of the _ size _ of the various phase diagrams for different representations noted in @xcite .",
