    "recent progress in the physics of ultra - cold gases have led to the creation of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) with dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) and attracted a great deal of interest in theoretical and experimental studies of weakly interacting bose gases @xcite .",
    "what render such systems particularly important is that the atoms interact via a ddi that is both long ranged and anisotropic and it can be also attractive and repulsive . by virtue of this interaction , dipolar gases",
    "are expected to open fascinating prospects for the observation of novel quantum phases in ultracold atomic gases @xcite .    at zero temperature ,",
    "there have been a number of theoretical studies on dipolar bec in particular on the expansion dynamics @xcite , the ground state @xcite , elementary excitations @xcite , superfluid properties @xcite , solitons and soliton - molecule @xcite and optical lattices @xcite .",
    "however , to date , finite temperature dipolar becs remain almost entirely unexplored . among the theories that have been used to investigate the behavior of such systems we can quote for instance mean field hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory @xcite and perturbation approach @xcite .",
    "an interesting alternative approach to the finite - temperature bose gas is provided by the so - called representative ensembles which has been proposed by yukalov one decade ago @xcite .",
    "the representative ensembles is a self - consistent approach describing bose - condensed systems .",
    "it guarantees the selfconsistency of all thermodynamic quantities , the validity of conservation laws , and a gapless spectrum of collective excitations @xcite .",
    "it is based on the bogoliubov shift of field operators , which explicitly breaks the gauge symmetry .",
    "the theory is valid for arbitrary interacting bose systems , whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium , uniform or in the presence of any external potentials , and at any temperature .",
    "furthermore , the theory has been used successfully to analyze bec in optical lattices @xcite , bec in disordered potentials @xcite and the formation of granular state in trapped becs @xcite .    in this paper , we extend the representative ensembles approach to a dipolar bose gas at finite temperature . within this theory",
    "we go beyond the zero - temperature mean - field approach where the gross - pitaevskii equation is solved numerically and analytically ( see for review @xcite ) .",
    "this finite - temperature analysis allows us to study in detail how the ddi enhances the thermal fluctuations and the thermodynamics of a bec .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ re ] , we review the main features of the representative ensembles theory which constitutes a relevant model to investigate the properties of dipolar bose gases at finite temperature . in section [ bg ] , we derive self consistently equations of motion for the condensed and the thermal cloud in the trapped case . accordingly , in the homogeneous case , analytic formulas are obtained for the noncondensed and anomalous densities at both low and high temperatures .",
    "the profile of such densities is plotted in terms of interaction strength and temperature . in section [ strucf ] ,",
    "we address effects of the interaction strength , the temperature and the angle between the polarization direction and the relative separation of the dipoles on the behavior of the static structure factor .",
    "section [ therm ] is devoted to highlight the impact of the ddi on some thermodynamic quantities such as the chemical potential , the ground state energy , the compressibility and the pressure . in section [ lda ]",

    "these are linearly independent , being orthogonal to each other , @xmath6 the operator of noncondensed atoms on average is zero , @xmath7 the condensate function is normalized to the number of condensed atoms @xmath8 while the number of noncondensed atoms is @xmath9 thus , the total number of atoms in the system is the sum @xmath10 the evolution equations for the variables are obtained by the extremization of an effective action @xcite , which yields the equation for the condensate function @xmath11 and for the field operator of noncondensed atoms @xmath12 where the grand hamiltonian is written as @xmath13 in which @xmath14\\ ; d{\\bf r } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a complex function . + the lagrange multipliers @xmath16 and @xmath17 guarantee the validity of the normalization conditions ( [ nor ] ) and ( [ nor1 ] ) , while the lagrange multipliers @xmath18 guarantee the conservation condition ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "evolution equations ( [ emc ] ) and ( [ emnc ] ) are proved to be identical to the heisenberg equations of motion @xcite .",
    "+ to determine explicitly the chemical potential , we first keep in mind that in experiments the total number of particles is fixed .",
    "then we write the internal energy ( [ ie ] ) in the standard way as @xcite @xmath19 connecting @xmath20 with the average of the grand hamiltonian @xmath21 and with the system chemical potential @xmath22 . at the same time , substituting into equation ( [ ie ] ) the grand hamiltonian ( [ gh ] ) , and taking into account condition ( [ mul1 ] ) , we come to the expression @xmath23 comparing equations ( [ ie ] ) and ( [ ene ] ) gives the definition of the system chemical potential @xmath24 expressed through the lagrange multipliers @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the related atomic fractions @xmath25    in equilibrium , the system statistical operator is defined by minimizing the information functional @xcite uniquely representing the system with the given restrictions .",

    "<S> the properties of ultracold quantum gases of bosons with dipole - dipole interaction is investigated at finite temperature in the frame of the representative ensembles theory . </S>",
    "<S> self - consistent coupled equations of motion are derived for the condensate and the non - condensate components . </S>",
    "<S> corrections due to the dipolar interaction to the condensate depletion , the anomalous density and thermodynamic quantities such as the ground state energy , the equation of state , the compressibility and the presure are calculated in the homogeneous case at both zero and finite temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> effects of interaction and temperature on the structure factor are also discussed . within the realm of the local density approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we generalize our results to the case of a trapped dipolar gas .    </S>",
