    "a robust physical theory is one that explains observed phenomena and obeys the laws of physics . and",
    ", in the sense of occam described above , it should be as parsimonious as possible with the number of assumptions used in its formulation .",
    "there are a number of lines of evidence that strongly suggest that magnetic fields play a crucial role in a comprehensive theory of star formation .",
    "for instance , observations of magnetic field strengths by oh zeeman splitting in dense gas ( e.g. , crutcher 1999 ) allow a determination of the mass - to - flux ratio @xmath1 in molecular clouds .",
    "when allowances are made for the random orientations of clouds and magnetic fields ( e.g. , see table 1 of shu et al .",
    "1999 ) , the observed values for @xmath1 in several clouds are found to be a factor @xmath2 below or above the critical value for gravitational collapse , @xmath3 ( e.g. , mouschovias & spitzer 1976 ) .",
    "that the observed values for these clouds are so close to the critical value indicates that magnetic fields must be instrumental in their support against self - gravitational collapse .",
    "additionally , crutcher s data set also reveals that the magnetic field strength @xmath4 scales with the gas density @xmath5 as @xmath6 , consistent with the predictions from models of equilibrium magnetic clouds ( mouschovias 1976 ) and ambipolar diffusion models of magnetically supercritical core formation and collapse in subcritical clouds ( fiedler & mouschovias 1993 ; ciolek & mouschovias 1994 , 1995 ; basu & mouschovias 1994 , 1995a , b ) .",
    "another inextricable link between magnetic fields and star formation is the angular momentum of stars and protostellar disks .",
    "it has long been known that if absolute conservation of angular momentum were to hold true throughout the evolution of a cloud , from its formation to protostellar collapse , then star formation would be halted by centrifugal forces ( e.g. , mestel & spitzer 1956 ) .",
    "the solution to this conundrum is magnetic braking of clouds and cores , which allows the efficient transfer of angular momentum via rotational alfvn waves along the magnetic field , from a cloud ( e.g. , mouschovias & paleologou 1979 , 1980 ) or core ( e.g. , basu & mouschovias 1994 , 1995a , b ) to an external medium .",
    "measurements do indeed find that rotational velocities in clouds are orders of magnitude smaller than that which would occur under strict conservation of angular momentum ( e.g. , goldsmith & arquilla 1985 ) .",
    "observations of near alignment of rotation axes with polarimetrically determined magnetic field direction in clouds ( e.g. , heyer et al .",
    "1987 ) and starless bok globules ( e.g. , kane & clemens 1995 ) also confirm the expected correspondence from magnetic braking models .",
    "another prediction of these models is retrograde rotation of clouds and fragments ( mouschovias & paleologou 1979 ) , which has also been seen to occur ( clark & johnson 1981 ; young et al .",
    "1981 ) .",
    "there are various other pieces of support for the importance of magnetic fields in star formation , such as the existence of the magnetic flux problem of star formation ( e.g. , mestel & spitzer 1956 ) , evidence that clouds are in near virial equilibrium , with linewidths that are related to the alfvn speed ( myers & goodman 1988 ; mouschovias & psaltis 1995 ) , and the potential importance of the parker instability in forming molecular cloud complexes ( mouschovias , shu , & woodward 1974 ) .    as argued above , _",
    "all _ of these various observational facts or threads of reasoning can be explained and tied logically together through a _",
    "single _ unifying theory of star formation in magnetically supported clouds . in the next section",
    "we summarize results of ambipolar diffusion models of core and star formation .",
    "more extensive treatments of the history and the relevant physics of the magnetic models of star formation can be found in the detailed reviews by mouschovias ( 1987 , 1996 ) and mouschovias & ciolek ( 1999 ) .",
    "ambipolar diffusion , the drift of neutral matter with respect to plasma and magnetic field , was originally suggested by mestel & spitzer ( 1956 ) as a way that magnetic flux can leak out of interstellar clouds and induce collapse and fragmentation .",
    "a fundamental reevaluation of this concept was introduced by mouschovias ( 1976 , 1977 , 1978 ) , who pointed out that the main effect of ambipolar diffusion is to gravitationally redistribute mass and magnetic flux within the interior magnetic flux tubes of a cloud , thereby initiating the formation and collapse of cores within magnetically supported envelopes .",
    "he further argued ( mouschovias 1979 , 1982 ) that core formation will occur on the ambipolar diffusion timescale , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the free - fall time and @xmath9 is the neutral - ion collision time in a cloud s inner flux tubes .",
    "early studies ( mouschovias 1979 ; nakano 1979 ; lizano & shu 1989 ) focused on quasistatic evolution and the approach to core formation .    the general theoretical scenario sketched above",
    "was verified by numerical simulations of the evolution of two - dimensional axisymmetric ( fiedler & mouschovias 1993 ) and flattened , thin - disk ( ciolek & mouschovias 1994 , 1995 [ cm94 , cm95 ] ; basu & mouschovias 1994 , 1995a , b [ bm94 , bm95a , b ] ; ciolek & basu 2000 [ cb00 ] ) , self - gravitating , isothermal , magnetic molecular cloud models . following the evolution of the central flux tubes of a model cloud from the initial quasistatic contraction ( due to ambipolar diffusion ) to the later phase of dynamical collapse , from initial densities @xmath10 to final densities @xmath11 , these model simulations found that supercritical [ @xmath12 cores did indeed form and separate within massive , subcritical [ @xmath13 envelopes .",
    "the core masses found in these models were typically in the range @xmath14 , with characteristic radii in the range @xmath15 pc , depending on the choice of model parameters such as the initial central mass - to - flux ratio @xmath16 ( in units of the critical value for collapse ) and the initial central degree of ionization @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the ion density ) .",
    "mean core densities @xmath20 were @xmath21 .",
    "a magnetic disk - model was presented by crutcher et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to explain the evolution of the barnard 1 ( b1 ) molecular cloud .",
    "model predictions for the b1 core were found to be in excellent agreement with observations ; predicted values of the core mass , and mean density and magnetic field strength were within 10% of the observed values .",
    "further discussion of quantitative comparison of ambipolar diffusion models with observations can be found in ",
    "3.1 below , as well as the paper by bacmann in this volume .    the disk - model clouds",
    "also included other interesting physical effects .",
    "dynamical effects of dust grains ( charged and neutral ) were studied in detail by ciolek & mouschovias ( 1993 , 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "enhanced friction due to collisions with grains increases the coupling of neutral particles to the magnetic field , and can significantly lengthen the time required to form a core .",
    "another interesting result from these models is that ambipolar diffusion reduces the dust - to - gas ratio in cores ( also discussed in ciolek & mouschovias 1996 ) , which , in turn , affects the ion chemistry in contracting cores , since ion and electron abundances in the gas phase are dependent on the rate of capture on grains ( an analytical derivation is provided by ciolek & mouschovias 1998 ) .",
    "rotation and magnetic braking were incorporated by basu & mouschovias ( 1994 , 1995a , b ) .",
    "these studies showed that magnetic braking is generally very efficient ( occurring on a timescale much shorter than @xmath22 ) , allowing a core to form and collapse with very little hindrance by centrifugal forces ; the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath23 in these models was found to consistent with observations of rotating cores and estimates of likely values in the early solar nebula .",
    "the effect of the interstellar ultraviolet radiation field was investigated by ciolek & mouschovias ( 1995 ) .",
    "they found that the increased ionization due to an external uv field greatly decreased the efficiency of ambipolar diffusion in cloud envelopes , significantly reducing the mass infall rate beyond the boundary of a supercritical core .",
    "further details of the models can be found in the studies cited above , as well as the more recent reviews mentioned in ",
    "some more discussion of the l1544 model of cb00 is provided in ",
    "3.1 below .",
    "the protostellar core within the l1544 cloud , located in taurus , has received considerable attention in recent years by various workers .",
    "one such study was by tafalla et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who determined that the neutral gas in the core was infalling at a speed @xmath24 on a scale @xmath25 .",
    "a later study by williams et al .",
    "( 1999 ) used @xmath26 lines to find the infall speeds of the ionized gas component , and found @xmath27 on smaller scales @xmath28 .",
    "both papers contrasted their findings with the ambipolar diffusion models of cm95 and bm94 , and suggested that a discrepancy existed because certain ambipolar diffusion models did not exhibit such large infall speeds at extended radii .",
    "however , as noted by cb00 , many of the features observed in l1544 ( such as the ion infall speed and density structure on smaller scales ) were in fact consistent with the previously published generic ambipolar diffusion models , if one considers the observed region in l1544 to lie _ within _ a supercritical core . even in the absence of a specific model",
    ", magnetic restoring forces must be important in the evolution of l1544 , since the magnitude of the inferred infall speeds are _ less _ than characteristic speeds such as the isothermal sound speed @xmath29 in the gas ( @xmath30 for this cloud ) and the free - fall speed at these radii ( @xmath31 ) . and ,",
    "as the linewidths in the l1544 core are very narrow ( williams et al . 1999 ) ,  turbulent \" support can not be invoked to explain the evidently retarded collapse .",
    "cb00 presented an ambipolar diffusion model specifically designed to study the evolution of the l1544 core .",
    "they modeled l1544 as a disk - like cloud inclined at an angle @xmath32 to the plane of the sky ; the resulting model evolution produced a core with radius 0.3 pc , which is indeed greater than the spatial scale studied by tafalla et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and williams et al .",
    "figure 1 ( _ left _ ) shows the spatial profile of the density at ten different times @xmath33 ( see caption ) .",
    "also shown ( _ right _ ) is the infall speed of the neutral gas @xmath34 ( _ solid _ lines ) and the ions @xmath35 ( _ dashed _ lines ) at the same times @xmath33 .",
    "qualitatively the overall behavior is similar to that seen in the earlier published ambipolar diffusion models , including the flattening of the density profiles at small radii , which is very similar to the density profiles seen in sub - mm dust continuum studies of prestellar cores ( e.g. , andr , ward - thompson , & motte 1996 ) . in table 1 ,",
    "cb00 model predictions at times @xmath36 and @xmath37 are compared with various observed quantities ( such as the mass @xmath38 , density @xmath39 , radial neutral and ion speeds @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and the mean line - of - sight magnetic field strength @xmath42 ) at several different radial locations .",
    "given the likely observational uncertainties , we note that _ all _ of the model predictions are in reasonable agreement with the actual measured values  including the extended infall observations and the measurement of @xmath42 by crutcher & troland ( 2000 ) , made subsequent to our prediction .",
    "( @xmath43 ) which lie in the range @xmath44 to @xmath45 for the l1544 model , are also in agreement with the limits deduced by benson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who inferred @xmath46 from velocity differences of neutral molecules ( ccs and @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 in sixty dense cores . ]",
    "this suggests that the current state @xmath49 of l1544 is described by the theoretical model for @xmath50 .",
    "the cb00 l1544 model is thus able to _ simultaneously _ explain the observations of several _ disparate _ observations at many _ different _ radial locations .",
    "we also note that the magnetic models were fully developed prior to 1995 , and were applied , without modification , to the recent observations of l1544 in a straightforward fashion .",
    "that a _ single _ magnetic model can explain the observations with ( e.g. , l1544 ) and without extended infall through variations of input parameters within the observationally allowable range , is particularly appealing , and in line with our discussion in   1 of",
    "what attributes ( simplicity , elegance , self - consistency , and predictive power ) a proper physical theory should have .",

    "recent statistical studies of protostellar cores and young stellar objects ( lee & myers 1999 ; jijina , myers , & adams 1999 ) have also estimated a similar evolutionary timescale for star formation .",
    "these studies also suggested that the observed timescales were in disagreement with earlier published ambipolar diffusion models ( e.g. , cm95 ; bm94 ) , which had cores forming on a timescale @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the initial central flux - loss timescale , as proposed early on by mouschovias ( see   1 ) .",
    "however , the relation @xmath58 is strictly valid only for highly subcritical model clouds , i.e. , clouds with @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , ambipolar diffusion models with less subcritical initial mass - to - flux ratios have @xmath60 .",
    "for instance , the l1544 model of cb00 had @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; numerically this was equal to 1.3 myr , similar to the values from the statistical studies cited above .",
    "hence , @xmath63 is dependent on @xmath16 .",
    "ciolek & basu ( 2001 ; [ cb01 ] ) revisited the problem of core formation by ambipolar diffusion , and derived an analytical expression for @xmath63 valid for _ all _ subcritical clouds ( @xmath64 ) . analyzing the evolution during the epoch of core formation",

    "this region of parameter space is especially of interest , since , as noted in   1 , crutcher ( 1999 )",
    "has measured mass - to - flux ratios in several clouds consistent with @xmath79 . while it is likely that crutcher s data set contains clouds that are evolving towards or",
    "have recently exceeded the critical state , and are therefore beginning to collapse ( which is what we suggest has occurred in l1544 ; see   3.1 above ) , it may also contain typical values of @xmath16 .",
    "_ this means that @xmath63 will be @xmath80 for clouds with these particular values of @xmath16 . _ numerically , @xmath81 , can be as small as @xmath82 ( cm98 ) so that a low @xmath17 is another means of reducing the flux - loss timescale ( e.g. , see models 8 and 9 of bm95a ) , and , hence , @xmath63 . ] where @xmath83 has been normalized to values typical of the interior of molecular clouds for @xmath84 ( e.g , cm98 ) .",
    "it follows then that @xmath85 myr for @xmath86 .",
    "_ thus , the recent statistical analyses suggesting that star formation occurs in some regions on timescales @xmath87 1 myr may be explained by observations of subcritical clouds and ambipolar diffusion models with central mass - to - flux ratios slightly below the critical value for collapse .",
    "_ further discussion of the consistency and implications of ambipolar diffusion models with estimated timescales for protostellar evolution , including the effect of dust grains , is presented in cb01 .",
    "bacmann et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have recently conducted an extensive isocam absorption survey of prestellar cores , including l1544 , and made quantitative comparison of their results to theoretical models of core formation and collapse .",
    "for the most part , they found that the ambipolar diffusion models of cm95 and bm94 provided the best model fits to their data in the interiors of cores .",
    "however , in some cores they found that on larger scales the cores effectively had  edges \" , where the density decreased rapidly with increasing radius  much more so than predicted by the theoretical models . for l1544 ,",
    "@xmath88 pc .",
    "quoted by bacmann et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is @xmath89 pc . ]",
    "bacmann et al .",
    "suggested that the presence of these edges indicates that the current theoretical models neglect some important physics on larger scales , such as turbulent support , which has not yet been incorporated into the ambipolar diffusion simulations .",
    "however , if the turbulence were due to hydromagnetic waves ( hmw ) , as advocated by mouschovias ( 1987 ) and mouschovias & psaltis ( 1995 ) , then it is possible that the reason the non - turbulent cb00 model matches observations for @xmath90 in l1544 is due to the _ decay _ of the turbulence for scales less than the alfvn minimum lengthscale @xmath91 ( kulsrud & pearce 1969 ) ; @xmath92 is the alfvn speed in the neutral gas .",
    "as first proposed by mouschovias ( 1987 ) , ambipolar diffusion will damp hmw for scales @xmath93 , resulting in a loss of support interior to this region when the hmw turbulence decays away .",
    "formation and collapse of cores can then proceed via the ` standard ' self - initiated ambipolar diffusion models , described earlier .",
    "numerically , the expression for the damping length @xmath94 , which , when evaluated for the initial parameters of the cb00 l1544 model , is @xmath95 pc . hence , if hmw were to be important in l1544 , we would expect that a non - turbulent ambipolar diffusion model would deviate from the actual evolution on scales @xmath96 , as observed",
    ". moreover , if decay of hmw has occurred for scales @xmath97 , the linewidths should be narrow in the core , which is again observed in l1544 .",
    "the later stages of core collapse has also been investigated .",
    "basu ( 1997 ) studied semi - analytically the approach of collapsing cores to higher densities than studied in the earlier numerical simulations .",
    "he suggested that ambipolar diffusion would continue to affect the increasingly dynamical infall even during the higher density stages of evolution , and also that the accretion rate @xmath98 would become significantly larger than the well - known , time - independent expression @xmath99 found in self - similar collapse models of a singular isothermal sphere ( shu 1977 ) .",
    "this was confirmed by ciolek & knigl ( 1998 ; [ ck98 ] ) , who followed the collapse of a magnetic protostellar core ( including the effect of ambipolar diffusion ) up to and beyond the formation of a finite mass object at @xmath100 , which they dubbed",
    " point - mass formation \" ( pmf ) .",
    "they followed the evolution in their models up to the time at which a @xmath101 object had accumulated at the center of a core .",
    "the accretion rate in their typical model reached a maximum value of @xmath102 near the onset of pmf , and then declined to approximately half that value by the time a @xmath101 protostar had formed . during the later stages of the evolution of their model ,",
    "ambipolar diffusion affected the accretion rate through the formation of a hydromagnetic shock at radii @xmath103 ; the relevant physics of the inflow and accretion of the numerical model was also captured in a companion self - similar collapse study presented by contopoulos , ciolek , & knigl ( 1998 ) .",
    "the duration of the ck98 simulations spanned the evolution of a protostar from a class 0 to a class i object .",
    "they suggested that the time - dependent accretion occurring in their models was in accordance with the analysis of bontemps et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who proposed that a decline in the observed momentum flux of co outflows from young stellar objects with decreasing envelope mass indicated a time - dependent @xmath98 during this transitional phase of a protostar s life .",
    "ck98 also compared their results to the measurements of the gas in the infalling disks of hl tau ( hayashi , ohashi , & miyama 1993 ) and l1551-irs5 ( ohashi et al .",
    "the late - time accretion rate and gas mass of the ck98 model at @xmath104 were consistent with observed values for both objects .",
    "a remarkable feature of the magnetic field strength measurements compiled by crutcher ( 1999 ) is that they are consistent with the intrinsic mass - to - flux ratios ( in units of the critical value ) of all cores being very close to unity ( see earlier discussion in   1 ) .",
    "additionally , the observed correlation @xmath6 , which implies some degree of flattening along the mean magnetic field direction , can even be improved if one accounts for internal support due to non - thermal motions ( basu 2000 ) . _",
    "the above two features of the measurements implies that cores have dynamically important magnetic fields and are characterized by force balance along magnetic field lines .",
    "_    recent submillimeter polarization maps of dense regions of molecular clouds ( matthews & wilson 2000 ; ward - thompson et al .",
    "2000 ) , in which the polarization vectors truly sample the dense gas , reveal that the magnetic field direction is invariably either parallel to the apparent minor axis of the objects or has a small offset angle @xmath105 relative to it .",
    "ward - thompson et al . ( 2000 ) measured @xmath106 for three cores ( including l1544 ) and wondered how strong magnetic fields were compatible with any nonzero @xmath105 .",
    "the resolution to this issue comes from the fact that the axisymmetric assumption in the magnetic models must be relaxed , even while the assumption of a dynamically important magnetic field is maintained . as pointed out by basu ( 2000 ) ,",
    "any non - axisymmetry in the core shape ( which makes them triaxial bodies ) results in a finite probability of viewing a nonzero @xmath105 .",
    "figure 3 illustrates how a single object can appear to have any possible value of @xmath105 , depending on the viewing angles ( @xmath107 ) defined on a spherical viewing surface around the triaxial body .",
    "however , if the shortest axis of the body is along the mean magnetic field direction , there is an expected correlation towards @xmath108 for a large sample of measurements ( basu 2000 ) .",
    "hence , large data sets can easily distinguish between this scenario and that advocated by ballesteros - paredes , vazquez - semadeni , & scalo ( 1999 ) , who use a highly turbulent model ( with a weak magnetic field ) to claim there should be no correlation between cloud elongation and magnetic field direction .",
    "the above explanation for the offset @xmath109 observed in l1544 by ward - thompson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) means that the axisymmetric assumption employed by cb00 needs to be relaxed , if only slightly .",
    "_ the correspondence of the crutcher & troland ( 2000 ) field strength measurement with the prediction of the cb00 model , and the overwhelming evidence for flattening along the mean field direction in a variety of cores ( @xmath6 ) implies that the oblate geometry of the cb00 model is a reasonable approximation . _      individual regions which form stars",
    "likely must damp their internal turbulent motions and also overcome the support due to the mean magnetic field . since these motions may damp preferentially at high density or column density where the coupling of charged particles is reduced , and the mean magnetic field effectively introduces a threshold column density for collapse (   2 ) , a fruitful approach to understanding cluster formation may be to study the properties of peaks above a critical threshold in a turbulent column density field .",
    "basu & pudritz ( 2000 ) have studied the properties of a gaussian field of column density fluctuations and how it relates to the properties of observed clusters .",
    "as they point out , star formation in terms of thresholds , rather than say , a preferred scale of fragmentation , is qualitatively in better agreement with observations .",
    "the threshold idea leads to the result that regions of high mean column density ( close to a critical threshold ) are likely to form stars ( in regions exceeding the threshold ) that are more closely spaced and typically more massive than in regions of low mean column density ( far from the threshold ) . in linear fragmentation theory ,",
    "regions of high column density yield a smaller fragmentation scale as well , but also favor stars of relatively lower masses .",
    "finally , the pressure due to an external column of ( turbulent ) matter may play a role in limiting the size of infall regions and creating core `` edges '' at smaller radii than in models without external turbulent motions ( see related discussion in ",
    "3.3 ) . despite objections to the concept of a confining pressure raised by ballesteros - paredes et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on the basis of a single simulation , we note that an external pressure must exist simply due to the _ weight _ of an external cloud or cloud complex . while turbulent motions obviously exert kinetic effects on some scale , neglecting external pressure is as absurd as neglecting the earth s atmospheric pressure on a windy day !",
    "in this paper we have described several aspects of the theory of star formation in magnetic interstellar clouds , first formulated in the 1970 s and developed further in the past decade .",
    "this single theoretical framework is consistent with ( and can predict ) various seemingly disparate facts such as the inefficiency of star formation , the structure of regions of core formation and collapse , magnetic field strengths and mass - to - flux ratios , transport of angular momentum , time - dependent mass accretion rates , magnetic field orientations in clouds , etc .",
    "in fact , specific models for core formation and evolution in two molecular clouds ( barnard 1 and l1544 ) have already been presented , and found to be in good agreement with observations for these two clouds .",
    "we have also discussed how recent data related to extended infall , timescales for star formation , and the alignment of magnetic fields in cores , are compatible with the results of magnetic , ambipolar diffusion models .",
    "our approach is to make quantitative predictions and , where possible , clarify differences with other competing scenarios .",
    "for instance , sub - mm polarimetric observations indicating some degree of alignment of magnetic fields and core axes strongly favor magnetic , ambipolar diffusion models , rather than highly turbulent star formation models advocated by some other workers , which predict no such correlation .",
    "it is through such rigorous testing that a scientifically valid theory of star formation will ultimately be determined .",

    "<S> we review theoretical models of the early stages of star formation , in which gravitational collapse is strongly regulated by magnetic fields and the associated process of ambipolar diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss results of numerical simulations and analytical studies of core formation and collapse , which can be directly tested against observation . </S>",
    "<S> we also focus on recent data which are relevant to this theory of star formation , such as : observations of extended infall in protostellar cores , estimates of evolutionary timescales @xmath0 myr for cores , measured mass - to - flux ratios of cores , and the relative alignment of polarization vectors with apparent cloud elongation . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in all of these areas , the data remain compatible with magnetic collapse models which lie within the observationally allowable range of parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> other areas of interest ( protostellar accretion rates and the presence of core edges ) and issues that remain unresolved or under study ( the role of non - thermal motions and cluster formation ) are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we highlight some differences between our model predictions and those of highly turbulent star formation models , and discuss how these differences can be distinguished observationally .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  never multiply explanations or make them more complicated than necessary </S>",
