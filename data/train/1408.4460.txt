    "in recent years , one of the primary areas of active numerical code development within astrophysics has been in multi - dimensional radiation hydrodynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "radiation plays a critical role in many astrophysical settings , including the interiors of stars , some accretion flows , and most explosive events .",
    "however , multi - dimensional radiation hydrodynamics is very challenging computationally , owing to the large number of degrees of freedom and wide range of temporal and spatial scales present .",
    "nevertheless , there are many interesting phenomena associated with the nonlinear interaction of radiation and gas that require a numerical treatment for a more complete understanding .",
    "one such application is the study of radiation - pressure dominated accretion flows onto black holes , which is the ultimate goal of the present work .    in working toward this goal ,",
    "our first step was to modify our relativistic mhd code _",
    "@xcite to treat radiative processes in black hole accretion disks in the optically - thin limit @xcite .",
    "optically thin treatments are the simplest to implement , as the radiation only enters the hydrodynamic equations as a cooling term .",
    "such treatments are appropriate for very low accretion rate systems , such as sgr a * , where we recently applied this technique @xcite .",
    "then , following the work of @xcite , we generalized _",
    "cosmos++ _ even further by implementing a two - moment closure formalism for general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics appropriate for the optically - thick limit @xcite .",
    "the restriction of that approach to optically - thick flows means that it is only applicable to problems with high degrees of symmetry , e.g. bondi @xcite or bondi - hoyle @xcite accretion , and at high accretion rates .",
    "the obvious next step is to develop a method that functions across a wide range of optical depths , which would allow intermediate mass accretion rates and less symmetric problems to be considered .",
    "doing so requires two advances beyond the method of @xcite : first , a more general closure relation for the radiation moments must be implemented ; second , the radiation equations must be solved in an implicit , or at least semi - implicit , way . in a semi - implicit scheme , which is also referred to as a hybrid explicit - implicit scheme",
    ", an implicit step is used to solve the radiation source terms , while an explicit step is used for the rest of the update ( c.f .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the advantage is that an implicit update is expected to be stable and avoids the `` stiffness '' problem associated with the radiation source term , especially when the gas and radiation are close to thermal equilibrium .",
    "the advantage of a semi - implicit scheme , as opposed to fully implicit one , is first that it can be more easily integrated into existing explicit mhd codes .",
    "second , when only the source term is being treated implicitly , it can be calculated locally , and therefore the method does not require a parallel matrix solve across the entire problem domain , as would a fully implicit scheme .    in this paper , we present a new way to perform the semi - implicit radiation source calculation .",
    "it involves taking 1st order taylor expansions of the conserved variables and radiation source terms .",
    "this results in a 9-dimensional matrix equation that , when inverted , returns the updated primitive variables at the new time , completing the update .",
    "this scheme is , effectively , an extension of the 5-dimensional primitive inversion scheme introduced in @xcite .",
    "this paper also presents a new application of our code to quasi - spherical accretion onto a black hole . for this simulation , we start from initial conditions similar to the bondi accretion problem that we have considered before , but we imbue the gas with a small amount of angular momentum , thus breaking the spherical symmetry .",
    "the angular momentum is not enough for significant amounts of the gas to circularize ; thus , angular momentum transport , such as from the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) , is not required for the gas to accrete onto the black hole . nevertheless , the angular momentum is enough for the resulting flow to develop a disk - like structure , as well as a latitude - dependent optical depth and flux .",
    "thinking about it from an observer s perspective , this would result in the source having a latitude - dependent inferred luminosity . in this work",
    "we present a case with an accretion rate of ten times the eddington rate , and find that the radiative flux varies by about 4% from along the symmetry axis to the midplane .",
    "section [ sec : method ] describes our method , with particular emphasis on the new closure relation and semi - implicit method for solving the radiation source terms . in section",
    "[ sec : tests ] , we report on a series of test problems meant to validate our code . in section [ sec : proga ] , we arrive at the novel new result of this paper  two - dimensional , quasi - spherical accretion onto a black hole , including radiation .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "most of the equations in this work are written in units where @xmath0 , although in a few places we leave in factors of @xmath1 for clarity .",
    "these are also the only unit restrictions in the code ; fluid and radiation variables can be evolved in otherwise arbitrary units .",
    "opacities and temperatures , however , are normally tabulated in cgs units .",
    "since most of our numerical method remains the same as was presented in @xcite , we give only an abbreviated presentation here .",
    "we also restrict discussion to the radiation - hydrodynamics equations , ignoring magnetic fields which do not impact the new method beyond what has already been discussed in our previous paper .",
    "the principle change from @xcite is that we now treat the radiation in its own rest frame ( defined as the frame in which the radiation flux vanishes ) , rather than in the fluid rest frame .",
    "this approach was introduced in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "its advantages will become apparent in a moment .    to keep the notation distinct between radiation variables in the different frames , we introduce two new variables , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , representing the radiation energy density in the radiation rest frame , and the spatial components of the radiation rest frame 4-velocity , respectively .",
    "formally , the radiation rest frame transport velocity , @xmath4 , can not go to @xmath1 in our method . in the same way that we must place a limiter on the fluid transport velocity ( or equivalently its boost factor ) , we also limit the radiation velocity .",
    "thus , there is always a frame in which we assume the radiation is at rest and isotropic , as required by the @xmath5 closure . by extension , this means we do not formally reach the free - streaming limit , though we can come arbitrarily close under ideal circumstances .",
    "the new variables can , of course , be related to our original ones , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , representing the radiation energy density and radiation flux in the fluid frame , respectively . to do so",
    ", we can compare the radiation stress energy defined in terms of the two sets of variables . in terms of the variables used in our previous paper ,",
    "the covariant radiation stress energy tensor is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the projection tensor , @xmath10 is the spacetime 4-metric , @xmath11 is the fluid rest frame 4-velocity , and the flux satisfies the normalization @xmath12 . in order to close this expression , we must define the radiation pressure in terms of @xmath6 ( and possibly @xmath7 ) . in our previous work",
    ", we utilized the so - called eddington approximation , @xmath13 , which assumes the radiation pressure is isotropic in the fluid frame . in terms of our new variables ,",
    "the radiation stress tensor becomes @xcite @xmath14 note that the radiation pressure does not appear explicitly in this expression .",
    "that is because it represents the covariant formulation of the @xmath5 closure scheme @xcite , which assumes that the radiation is isotropic in the radiation rest frame .",
    "if we wish to convert from the old variables to the new ones , we can easily solve the following two equations for @xmath2 and @xmath15 given the radiation stress tensor components @xmath16 defined using equation ( [ eq : radstress_old ] ) @xcite : @xmath17 the time components of equation ( [ eq : radstress ] ) can be used to find the remaining spatial components , @xmath3 .    that defines the new primitive radiation variables .",
    "however , we also changed our code to use a different form of the fluid and radiation velocities .",
    "now , during the evolution , we use the fluid and radiation 4-velocities projected into the space of the normal observer , i.e. an observer with 4-velocity @xmath18 .",
    "the contravariant time component of the 4-velocity vanishes under this projection , while the spatial components become @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the square of the lapse , @xmath22 is the shift vector , @xmath23 is the lorentz factor of the flow as measured by the normal observer , and @xmath24 .",
    "compared with the transport velocity , @xmath25 , which is restricted to the numerical range @xmath26 , @xmath27 has the advantage that it has no physical restriction on its range , going from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "the other possible choice for a primitive velocity variable , @xmath30 , has the problem that the resulting expression for @xmath31 can be ambiguous as to a sign . with these changes ,",
    "the set of primitive variables used in this work is : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the rest mass density and @xmath34 is the specific internal energy , both measured in the fluid rest frame .",
    "this represents a change from @xmath35 used in our previous work . the switch from @xmath36 to @xmath34 simplifies the taylor expansions used for solving the source term and primitive inversion in section [ sec : source ] ; the switch from @xmath37 to @xmath27 adds robustness and stability in certain cases ; and finally , the switch from @xmath38 to @xmath39 moves us from the eddington closure to the @xmath5 closure .",
    "this new radiation method is formally independent of optical depth ; the m1 closure itself does not place any restriction on the optical depth in any frame .",
    "in fact , there are some cases where we may want to treat the radiation variables entirely independently of whatever the background hydrodynamic flow may be doing .",
    "our beam - of - light test in section [ sec : beam ] is one such example . in this case , it is sufficient to solve the decoupled radiation stress energy equation @xmath40 this can be written as the following set of conservation laws : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the conserved radiation energy density , @xmath43 is the conserved radiation momentum density , @xmath44 is the 4-metric determinant , and @xmath45 is the geometric connection coefficients of the metric .",
    "the form of these conservation laws is identical to the form of the fluid energy and momentum conservation laws already solved in _",
    "cosmos++ _ , and the same techniques can be used , specifically the high - resolution shock - capturing ( hrsc ) scheme , described in @xcite . in this decoupled case , the recovery of the primitive hydrodynamic variables proceeds in the normal way ( available options within _ cosmos++ _ are described in @xcite ) , while the primitive radiation variables are recovered from equations ( [ eq : radstress])([eq : rtt ] ) , using the procedure described in section [ sec : primitives ] , with the radiation stress energy components coming from the updated conserved variables .      for more interesting problems , where the radiation and hydrodynamics are coupled",
    ", we aim to solve the following set of conservation equations for mass @xmath46 fluid stress - energy @xmath47 and radiation stress - energy @xmath48 as usual , the fluid stress - energy tensor is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the gas pressure . in this work we are ignoring magnetic fields , though they can easily be included as described in @xcite .",
    "the coupling of the fluid and radiation equations occurs through the radiation 4-force density , @xmath51 , which can conveniently be written in the form @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the grey ( frequency - independent ) opacity , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 being the contributions due to absorption and scattering , respectively , and @xmath56 is the integrated blackbody ( planck ) function at temperature @xmath57 , with radiation constant @xmath58 .",
    "the full set of conservation equations to be solved can now be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the generalized fluid density , @xmath61 is the relativistic boost factor , @xmath62 is the fluid transport velocity , @xmath63 is the total energy density , @xmath64 is the covariant momentum density , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the conserved radiation fields already defined .",
    "to proceed , we utilize a new hybrid explicit - implicit scheme , primarily intended to address stability issues associated with the radiation source term ( section [ sec : source ] ) . in the first step of this method",
    ", we use the explicit hrsc method , described in @xcite , to update the set of conserved variables @xmath67 to an intermediate state based on the following finite volume representation @xmath68 accounting for the curvature source terms @xmath69 and flux terms @xmath70 the flux terms are calculated at zone faces using either the harten - lax - van leer ( hll ) or lax - friedrichs riemann solver with either linear or ppm slope limited reconstruction of the primitive fields .      once the explicit step is complete , we follow it with an implicit one of the form @xmath71 that attempts to complete the update by accounting for the radiation source terms @xmath72 we perform the implicit integration iteratively , with the @xmath73 guess given by @xmath74 taking the 1st order taylor expansion of the first term in equation ( [ eqn : iterate ] ) and the radiation 4-force density @xmath75 , with respect to the primitive variables , we can approximate the ( @xmath73)st iterate as @xmath76 where @xmath77 plugging the expanded form of each variable into equation ( [ eqn : iterate ] ) , we get the following set of equations for the primitive fields @xmath78 @xmath79 we now have a set of linear equations that can be represented as a single matrix equation of the form @xmath80 with jacobian matrix @xmath81 or more explicitly @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 note that @xmath85 is really a @xmath86 matrix , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are 9-dimensional vectors ; we have simply condensed the notation by representing each 3-vector in @xmath85 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 as a single entry .",
    "the important point is that the matrix @xmath85 and vector @xmath88 only include terms known at iteration @xmath89 . from these",
    "we can solve for the vector of unknown primitives at iteration @xmath73 , @xmath90 , by inverting the matrix @xmath85 and solving for @xmath87 in equation ( [ eqn : matrix ] ) .",
    "for the initial @xmath91 guess , we use the values of @xmath92 from the previous timestep . at each step , the conserved variables @xmath93 are recalculated from the corresponding primitive set @xmath94 .",
    "we iterate until @xmath95 or the number of iterations exceeds some maximum .",
    "typical values are @xmath96 , with the maximum number of iterations being 20 .",
    "only rarely is the maximum iteration count exceeded in the problems presented in this work . in these rare cases ,",
    "the code will try both the analytic and numerical matrix inversion procedures .",
    "if both fail , then the code replaces the primitive quantities in the problematic cell with an average of surrounding neighbor cells that have not failed this step .",
    "we have found in our testing that using a tighter tolerance imposes a small penalty in terms of computational time .",
    "for example , tightening the tolerance to @xmath97 adds about 6% to the computational time for the radiation shock tube tests presented in section [ sec : radtube ] .",
    "we have tested both analytic and numerical procedures for calculating the derivatives in ( [ eqn : a ] ) .",
    "both give reasonable and consistent results ; we presently use the analytic method as our first option , with the numerical one acting as a back - up .",
    "appendix [ sec : derivs ] reports all of the necessary derivatives for calculating @xmath85 analytically .",
    "the numerical method is based on a forward difference approximation for the jacobian matrix ( [ eqn : jacmatrix ] ) , provided all conserved fields and source terms are evaluated as functions of the primitive iterates .",
    "since the matrix equation ( [ eqn : matrix ] ) involves only local calculations , its evaluation does not suffer from the scaling difficulties known to plague global matrix inversions .",
    "_ cosmos++ _ has a number of matrix solvers and preconditioners built in .",
    "the ones that we found worked well in this application are lu decomposition and gaussian elimination .",
    "we tried each of these on the cloud shadow test problem in section [ sec : cloud ] , where we report what few differences we found .",
    "this method of solving the radiation source terms clearly also accomplishes the primitive inversion step , since we ultimately end up with the set of primitives @xmath92 at the new timestep @xmath98 .",
    "in fact , this approach is quite similar to the @xmath99 primitive inversion scheme described in @xcite , which we have added as an option in _ cosmos++ _ , independent of whether or not the radiation package is being used .",
    "the method is also similar to the failure recovery option described in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "we mention again that magnetic fields can easily be included since their primitive form is trivially related to their conserved form ( c.f . * ? ? ? * ) and they do not enter into the radiation source terms",
    ".      one of the advantages of reformulating our gr radiation mhd method in terms of the new primitive radiation variables , @xmath2 and @xmath100 , is that it makes it trivially easy to calculate the characteristic wave speeds associated with the radiation fields , as required for our approximate riemann solvers . in the radiation rest frame , this speed is simply @xmath101 . following a procedure similar to that described in section 2.5 of @xcite , we simply boost this speed into the grid ( a.k.a .",
    "coordinate ) frame .",
    "in this section we present a series of test problems meant to validate various aspects of our new method .",
    "where appropriate , we include comparisons to our previous method .",
    "the first tests we perform are the same four radiative shock tube tests first introduced in @xcite and repeated in @xcite .",
    "each test includes a different nonlinear radiation - hydrodynamic wave , specifically : a nonrelativistic strong shock ( case 1 ) ; a mildly relativistic strong shock ( case 2 ) ; a highly relativistic wave ( case 3 ) ; and a radiation - pressure - dominated , mildly relativistic wave ( case 4 ) .",
    "we initialize each test with a `` left '' and `` right '' state , initially separated by an imaginary partition .",
    "the goal of these tests is two - fold : 1 ) to confirm that the new semi - implicit scheme can reproduce the results of our previous fully explicit scheme ; and 2 ) to facilitate a straightforward comparison of the performance ( primarily speed ) of the two methods . with regards to the first goal , the results of all four tests are visually indistinguishable from figures 1 - 4 of @xcite ; therefore , we do not reproduce those figures here",
    ". we also monitored the @xmath102 - 1 norm error ( i.e. @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the numerical and semi - analytic solutions , respectively ) for the case 4 test .",
    "the errors with the semi - implicit scheme were nearly identical to those reported in table 2 of @xcite , demonstrating that the convergence rate on this test is again almost exactly 2 when using piecewise linear interpolation , as it should be .",
    "as for the second goal of testing the performance , we found , not surprisingly , that the semi - implicit scheme is somewhat slower than the fully explicit one . on the case 3 test with 800 zones on a single 2.4 ghz processor on the college of charleston cluster , the fully explicit method executed 43 cycles / s , while the semi - implicit scheme with the lu decomposition matrix solver only managed 23 cycles / s ( both for @xmath106 )",
    "however , because of the increased stability of the semi - implicit scheme , the new code is able to run this test with a timestep that is 10 times larger than that used by our previously published code , so we are still better off in terms of total cpu time .",
    "the previous section demonstrates the convergence rate of the new numerical scheme in the presence of only optically thick radiation fields ; here we extend the convergence tests to investigate the performance of the @xmath5 closure over a broader range of optical depths and in cases that include stiff source terms . to do so ,",
    "we reproduce a set of tests , initially performed in the newtonian limit by @xcite and then in relativistic form by @xcite , that require accurately propagating linear mhd waves in the presence of radiation .",
    "the tests include sound , as well as fast and slow magnetosonic , waves , all propagating within various optical depth backgrounds .",
    "each test begins by initializing eigenmodes of the form @xmath107",

    "the @xmath109 $ ] represents the real part of a given variable .",
    "the unperturbed background gas and radiation fields have the following parameters : @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "the sound speed in the background is @xmath113 . for a @xmath114 gas , which we assume , this gives a gas internal energy of @xmath115^{-1 } = 9.13706 \\times 10^{-3}$ ] . in cases where magnetic fields are included ,",
    "the alfvn speed is @xmath116 .",
    "we split the background field evenly between @xmath117 and @xmath118 components , such that @xmath119 .",
    "the background radiation pressure is set from the dimensionless parameter , @xmath120 = @xmath121 , where the thermal pressure of the background gas is @xmath122 and the radiation energy in the fluid rest frame is @xmath123 .",
    "we wish to also have the radiation field start in local thermodynamic equilibrium with the gas , i.e. @xmath124 , where @xmath125 ( in units where @xmath126 ) .",

    ", the introduction of angular momentum provides some centrifugal support to the gas .",
    "conservation of angular momentum allows this support to become more significant as the gas is transported to smaller radii , leading to the formation of a thick , disk - like structure close to the black hole ( see figure [ fig : proga ] , _ left _ panel ) .",
    "the spherical symmetry of the radiation field is also broken ( see figure [ fig : proga ] , _ right _ panel ) .",

    "[ fig : flux ] ]    the total emitted luminosity at the outer grid boundary for this simulation is approximately @xmath382 ( where , again , @xmath383 is in units of the eddington luminosity ) . despite the very high mass accretion rate , we again observe a very sub - eddington luminosity , although not as low as for a one - dimensional bondi inflow problem with the same mass accretion rate and temperature ( @xmath384 ) , so the centrifugal support is allowing the gas to radiate more of its energy prior to being accreted into the black hole .",
    "the centrifugal support and increased radiation pressure also means that not as much gas is actually able to reach the black hole event horizon as in the one - dimensional problem .",
    "figure [ fig : mdot ] shows that the effective mass accretion rate onto the black hole is only about one fifth of the feeding rate at the outer boundary .",
    "it also shows that the total gas mass on the grid continues to increase throughout the duration of the simulation , forming an ever larger disk .",

    "mass is fed from the outer boundary at a rate of @xmath385 .",
    "[ fig : mdot ] ]    finally , we note that there are interesting low density `` bubbles '' in the accretion disk , as seen in the _ left _ panel of figure [ fig : proga ] .",
    "these bubbles are long - lived and slowly move outward in radius , possibly due to buoyant forces .",
    "these features can not be gas pressure supported , as they exhibit lower gas pressure than their surroundings .",
    "they also do not appear to be radiation pressure supported , since they do not show up in any of the radiation field plots ( see , for example , the _",
    "right _ panel of figure [ fig : proga ] ) . of course , because they are low density , they are also identifiable in the _ right _ panel of figure [ fig : proga ] as relatively low optical depth regions ( remember , we calculate optical depth as @xmath374 ) .",
    "it appears these features are associated with hydrodynamic eddies that form in the flow , as indicated by looking at the velocity vector field in the _ left _ panel of figure [ fig : proga ] .",
    "features such as these could conceivably play a role in enhancing the local radiative flux and overall radiative efficiency of the flow , although this effect does not appear to be significant in this case .",
    "this could be because the density contrasts in this particular case are not very large ( roughly a factor of 2 )",
    ". it will be interesting to see how these features behave at higher luminosities and in the presence of magnetic fields , topics that will be explored in future work .",
    "in this paper we have presented a new method for solving the equations of general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "our testing has demonstrated two critical improvements over our previous method : the first is the introduction of a more general closure scheme for the radiation equations , in our case , the so - called @xmath5 closure .",
    "as shown with the cloud shadow test ( section [ sec : cloud ] ) , this scheme corrects some of the unphysical flaws found with the eddington approximation used previously .",
    "furthermore , it allows us to cover a much broader range of optical depths , as demonstrated by the bondi inflow test ( section [ sec : bondi ] ) .",
    "the second is the implementation of a hybrid explicit - implicit ( or semi - implicit ) evolution scheme .",
    "the bondi inflow test further demonstrated that our new method is stable over a much broader range of parameters than our previous one .",
    "we are now able to consider temperatures and mass accretion rates that are orders of magnitude higher and lower than were possible in our earlier study , and often with significantly larger timesteps and reduced computational expense .    because of these improvements , we are now in a position to study entire classes of problems that were not accessible to our previous method , such as the cloud shadow test , and of more physical interest , multi - dimensional , super - eddington accretion onto black holes .",
    "an example of this latter class of problems was presented in section [ sec : proga ] , in the form of a quasi - spherical accretion flow onto a black hole , with a mass accretion rate ten times the eddington value .",
    "the angular momentum supplied to the gas in that case provided enough centrifugal support for a disk - like structure to form .",
    "however , the radiative efficiency remained extremely low ( @xmath386 in units of the eddington luminosity ) .",
    "as in the pure bondi inflow case , most of the dissipated energy was carried into the black hole .",
    "in contrast , more nearly keplerian disks have been shown to exhibit ( inferred isotropic ) luminosities as high as @xmath387 @xcite .",
    "further simulations will help bridge the gap between our low angular momentum case and those higher angular momentum ones .",
    "we can now also begin a systematic study of the parameter space associated with super - eddington accretion .",
    "there are many open theoretical questions to be addressed by such a study",
