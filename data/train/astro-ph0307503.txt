    "with the possible exception of the white dwarf cooling sequence , the main sequence is perhaps the best understood phase of stellar evolution .",
    "conversion of hydrogen to helium occurs in the stellar core representing a stable and long lasting phase of evolution . as we proceed along the main sequence from high mass stars to low mass , the production of energy in the core transitions from the cno bi - cycle to the proton - proton chain , while , at the same time , the primary energy transfer mechanism in the core goes from convection to radiative diffusion . in addition , the outer convection zone deepens progressively until the star becomes fully convective below @xmath60.35@xmath7 ( baraffe et al .",
    "all of these features are modelled with varying degrees of success in modern stellar structure and evolution codes .",
    "the _ degree _ of success we attribute to stellar models is primarily based on how well they match the observations .",
    "comparisons such as this have been performed in a number of ways .",
    "one method that has been used in the past involves comparing isochrones to the locations of nearby field stars in the hr diagram ( e.g. baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ; bergbusch & vandenberg 2001 ; yi et al . 2001 ) . aside from the uncertainties",
    "inherent in their trigonometric parallaxes , the primary drawback of using these stars to test the isochrones is the need to correct their colours for their differing metallicities .",
    "another method that has been used to test the theoretical isochrones is exemplified by the work of andersen et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , nordstrm & johansen ( 1994 ) , and most recently by lastennet & valls - gabaud ( 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "these authors have determined the masses , effective temperatures , and luminosities of individual stars in nearby binary systems and compared their hr diagram locations to the predictions of theoretical models .",
    "while the method has a number of intrinsic advantages , its primary shortcoming is the obvious requirement that stars must be in binary systems and in relative proximity to the sun to be studied in detail .",
    "a third method used to test theoretical stellar models , and the one we are utilizing in the present work , involves comparing the theoretical isochrones with _ cluster _ colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and two - colour diagrams ( tcds ) in various passbands ( e.g. castellani et al .",
    "2002 ; von hippel et al . 2002 ; von hippel , sarajedini , & ruiz 2003 ) .",
    "since all stars are of the same age and metal abundance , this approach is less uncertain than comparing with individual field stars ; however , the reddening is still required to perform the comparisons in the tcd ( though the similarity in the slopes of the reddening vector and the model loci mitigates this somewhat ) , and both the distance and reddening are needed for the cmd comparisons . with the veritable explosion of recent high quality ccd photometry for open clusters , this technique is becoming increasingly more powerful as we will demonstrate in the present work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents a discussion of the optical and ir photometry .",
    "we briefly compare and contrast the various stellar evolution models in section 3 .",
    "section 4 represents the primary scientific results of the present investigation ; herein , we discuss the successes and failures of the models in terms of how well they match the two - colour diagrams and colour - magnitude diagrams of open clusters .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "the optical photometry for the six open clusters considered herein is taken from the following sources : m35 , ngc 2420 , ngc 1817 ( wiyn open cluster study , deliyannis et al . in preparation ) , m67 ( montgomery , marschall , & janes 1993 ) , m37 ( kalirai et al . 2001 ) , and ngc 2477 ( kassis , et al . 1997 ) . to complement the optical data , we utilize @xmath8 infrared photometry available from the second incremental data release of the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "for all clusters in our sample we use the same criteria for the 2mass data retrieval .",
    "first , source brightness is limited to 6th magnitude or fainter due to the possible saturation of bright sources ( carpenter 2000 ) .",
    "second , we have initially chosen all cluster samples to have a radius of 30 arcmin . the radius",
    "is then reduced to as small as 10 arcmin so as to isolate cluster members and minimize field star contamination .",
    "lastly , the 2mass catalogue provides a read flag ( rd_flg ) which indicates how photometry of each star was measured .",
    "we have excluded from our sample any sources marked with a read flag of zero in any one band since this imples that the star was not detected in that band and the magnitude reported is therefore only an upper limit .",
    "we note that a majority of source magnitudes come from point spread - function fitting ( rd_flg = 2 ) , however , we have chosen to include stars with aperture photometry ( rd_flg = 1 ) so as to allow the inclusion of brighter cluster stars .",
    "the 2mass program uses a k - short ( @xmath9 ) filter for their photometry , which we have chosen to convert to the bessell & brett ( 1998 , hereafter bb ) k - band using the transformation equations derived by carpenter ( 2001 ) adapted as follows : @xmath10 / ( 0.972 \\pm 0.006)\\ ] ] and @xmath11 - ( 0.000 \\pm 0.005)(j - k_{bb}).\\ ] ] the bb photometric system has been adopted by a majority of the stellar evolutionary models analysed in the present paper .",
    "we combine optical and infrared photometry for stars in each cluster that are common to both data sets .",
    "all photometry files have ra and dec available for each star .",
    "to combine the data , we calculate the spatial offset between each star in the ir dataset with every star listed in the corresponding optical dataset .",
    "when the spatial offset is minimized to within a given threshold , the two stars are considered a match .",
    "the threshold distance is chosen based on the combined ra and dec errors and turns out to be 2.8 arcsec for all clusters .",
    "twarog et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have compiled a database of information for 76 open clusters , for which they provide internally consistent values of reddening , distance modulus , and metallicity .",
    "all of the clusters discussed in this study are included in the twarog et al .",
    "( 1997 ) catalogue , so we choose to adopt their values for the reddening and metallicity .",
    "cluster ages are taken from grocholski & sarajedini ( 2002 ) . in the case of m35 , its age",
    "is calculated using the method described in grocholski & sarajedini ( 2002 ) , which involves adopting ages from the webda database and offsetting them to the age scale of sarajedini ( 1999 ) .",
    "we note that while we have tried to make the cluster ages as internally consistent as possible , small variations in age have no effect on the location of theoretical isochrones along the unevolved ms .",
    "table 1 lists these cluster parameters along with the filter passbands of the available photometry .",
    "since we are primarily interested in comparing theoretical isochrones to cluster photometry in a variety of passbands , we have chosen to determine the distance moduli in the following manner . given the adopted reddenings in table 1 , we shift each set of isochrones ( described in sec .",
    "3 ) vertically in the @xmath12 cmd until the model main sequence at @xmath13=6.0 fits that of the clusters . since m37",
    "does not have i - band data , we utilize @xmath14 for the ms fitting .",
    "we have avoided using @xmath15 for this purpose because it is more sensitive than @xmath12 to metallicity variations at temperatures above @xmath6 4000k ( @xmath16 8.5 ) which could result in erroneous distance determinations in cases where the closest available isochrone metallicity differs somewhat from the actual cluster abundance ( baraffe 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "the results , along with the distances given by twarog et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , are given in table 2 . in this way",
    ", we can be sure that the models fit the main sequences in one colour at a given point allowing us to investigate how well they fit in other colours at other points along the ms .    to correct for interstellar extinction",
    ", we adopt the reddening law derived by cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) , which , using their value of @xmath17 = 3.1 and taking into account the central wavelength of each filter , we find the following relations for the near - ir passbands : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 . for observations of m 37 , @xmath21 and for all other optical photometry , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .    in figs . 1 and 2 we present [ @xmath13 , @xmath15 ] and [ @xmath13 , @xmath12 ] cmds , respectively , for all clusters using the full optical data and in fig .",
    "3 we show [ @xmath13 , @xmath14 ] cmds using the combined optical and infrared datasets .",
    "the clusters are plotted in order of increasing age from upper left to lower right .",
    "we remind the reader that m 37 does not have i band observations available and is not included in fig .",
    "we now introduce and briefly compare the five sets of theoretical isochrones that are used in the present analysis  padova ( girardi et al . 2002 ) , baraffe ( baraffe et al . 1998 ) , y@xmath0 ( yi et al . 2001 ) , geneva ( lejeune & schaerer 2001 ) , and siess ( siess , dufour , & forestini 2000 ) . while we do not intend this to be a comprehensive review of the stellar models , we point out some of the similarities and differences between the input parameters of the five groups as listed in table 3 .",
    "with respect to the opacities , all of the groups use versions of the opal opacities ( e.g. iglesias & rogers 1996 ) for high temperatures supplemented by the alexander & ferguson ( 1994 , af94 ) tables for low temperatures .",
    "the only caveat is that the geneva models also consider the kurucz ( 1991 ) low temperature opacities .",
    "we see that all five groups utilize different sources for their equations of state .",
    "three of the groups use similar values for core overshoot in all of their models , while siess has only included overshoot for their solar metallicity models .",
    "baraffe has chosen to not include core overshoot because the focus of their work is low mass stars , which , for masses below @xmath29 , are fully convective so an overshoot parameter is not necessary .",
    "also , for low mass stars above this limit , a convective core is only present for a small fraction of time during their evolution , so inclusion of overshoot will not have a significant effect on these objects ( chabrier & baraffe 1997 ) . mixing length parameters are similar for all groups , varying by less than 20% .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the baraffe models are available with three mixing length values , @xmath30 1.0 , 1.5 , 1.9 . setting the mixing length equal to 1.9",
    "is required to match observations of the sun ( baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ) , however these models are not extended below @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find that , for @xmath33 , their isochrones with the three different mixing lengths converge , implying that the mixing length has little effect on the models below this mass .",
    "as such , we combine the @xmath34 models for masses above @xmath35 with @xmath36 models covering the very low mass stars .",
    "lastly , we compare each group s method of deriving synthetic photometry for their models which is then used to convert effective temperatures to colours .",
    "the calculations by both the geneva and y@xmath0 groups come from versions of the @xmath37 stellar spectral library ( see eg .",
    "lejeune and schaerer 2001 ) .",
    "this library is based on model atmosphere spectra by kurucz ( 1995 ) , fluks et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and bessell et al .",
    "( 1989 , 1991 ) .",
    "padova calibrations are also based largely on the spectral library of kurucz ( 1992 ) with extension to cool stars through the use of fluks et al .",
    "( 1994 ) empirical m giant spectra and the dusty99 ( chabrier et al . 2000 ) atmosphere models of cool dwarf ( type m and later ) synthetic spectra ( see @xmath383 of girardi et al .",
    "2002 for a complete discussion ) .",
    "the siess model uses @xmath39 relations from schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) and bessell ( 1991 ) and @xmath40 relationships from fitzgerald ( 1970 ) and arribas & martinez - rogers ( 1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "lastly , the baraffe isochrones use stellar spectra generated with the nextgen model atmosphere code ( eg .",
    "hauschildt , allard , & baron 1999 ) which is a predecessor of the aforementioned dusty99 models .    in fig .",
    "4 we plot log@xmath41 vs. log@xmath42 for each of the models used in this study ( note that we have included the complete @xmath43 1.0 as well as the @xmath30 1.9 baraffe models ) .",
    "all isochrones are for solar metallicity and an age of 5 gyr ; the position of the sun is indicated by the filled circle .",
    "the inset box shows a close - up of the region around the sun .",
    "comparing the models in the theoretical plane allows us to eliminate the uncertainty inherent in the transformation to the observational plane . in this figure",
    "we see that four of the plotted isochrones , padova ( solid line ) , baraffe , @xmath44 ( dotted line ) , y@xmath0 ( dash - dot line ) , and geneva ( dash - dot - dot line ) are all in good agreement for the upper ms and the position of the sun , but show considerable deviation beginning around @xmath45 ( @xmath13@xmath67.5 , @xmath46 , @xmath47k , and spectral type @xmath6 k7 ) .",
    "neither siess nor baraffe ( @xmath36 ) match the sun and , for a given luminosity , predict cooler effective temperatures than the other isochrones on the upper ms .",
    "figure 5a displays the relationship between model mass and absolute magnitude in the v - band .",
    "in particular , the lower panel of fig .",
    "5a shows the difference in mass between each isochrone and the padova set , which has been chosen as an arbitrary reference .",
    "we see that the mass differences are minimized at @xmath13@xmath66.0 , the magnitude at which we have determined the distance modulus of each cluster ( sec .",
    "2 ) . at fainter magnitudes the differences between the various models steadily",
    "increase but are generally less than 0.1@xmath48 .",
    "fainter than @xmath13@xmath69 , the masses of the @xmath49 models begin to deviate from the others . as we discuss how well the models fit the observations in the cmd , fig .",
    "5a will prove useful in estimating the mass at each value of the absolute magnitude .",
    "figure 5b compares the difference in colour between each model and the solar abundance padova isochrone as a function of absolute v - band magnitude for @xmath15 ( top panel ) , @xmath12 ( middle ) , and @xmath14 ( bottom ) . as with fig .",
    "5a , the colour differences are generally smaller at @xmath13@xmath66.0 and increase at fainter magnitudes .",
    "furthermore , one would expect that if the models all used the same method for converting effective temperatures to colours , then the appearance of fig .",
    "5b would be solely a reflection of the differences in the physics of the models ( see fig .",
    "we see , however , that this is not the case ; there are no clear systematic trends in these differences from model to model ( with the possible exception of the geneva isochrones ) .",
    "these virtually random differences indicate that the disagreement between models is a result of both the chosen physics and the colour transformations .",
    "as mentioned in @xmath50 , we are interested in comparing the observational cmds with theoretical models for a variety of colours . these comparisons are illustrated in figs . 6 through 22 for the 6 clusters in our sample . in each case",
    ", we show the [ @xmath1 , [ @xmath2 , and [ @xmath3 diagrams along with the isochrone that is closest to the clusters metallicity as listed in table 1 .",
    "listed in each plot are the cluster name and model name , along with two numbers that indicate which isochrone is used .",
    "the first number gives the log age of the model ( e.g. 0945 @xmath51 log@xmath52 ) and the second indicates the metal abundance ( e.g. z019 @xmath51 z = 0.019 ) . in the case of the padova isochrones , leo girardi kindly provided interpolated models that match the cluster metal abundances .",
    "in addition , because the m37 data of kalirai et al .",
    "( 2001 ) does not possess i - band photometry , we only show data in the @xmath15 and @xmath14 colours . to simplify the discussion below",
    ", we will refer to mismatches between the models and the observations as occuring in the magnitude direction with the understanding that there may be a component in the colour direction as well .",
    "looking at the cmd and isochrone comparisons in figs . 6 through 22 , a number of trends stand out .",
    "first , we confirm that all of the models fit the cluster ms at @xmath13=6.0 in the @xmath12 plane .",
    "this is to be expected given the manner in which we determined the cluster distance moduli .",
    "next , we examine the isochrone comparisons in the @xmath15 plane shown in figs . 6 through 11 . in the vast majority of cases ,",
    "the model main sequences match the observations at @xmath13=6.0 adequately .",
    "there are two notable exceptions to this .",
    "first , the m37 photometry is significantly fainter than all of the isochrones considered herein by between @xmath60.5 and @xmath60.9 mag in colour .",
    "as such , we will exclude it from further discussion within the context of the other @xmath15 cmds .",
    "second , the baraffe models are consistently brighter than the observations at @xmath13=6.0 , except in the case of m35 . moving on to the other regions of the cmd in the @xmath15 plane ,",
    "all of the models reproduce the unevolved ms in the range 2.0@xmath53@xmath13@xmath537.0 reasonably well .",
    "the primary exception to this is the fit of the geneva models to the m35 photometry shown in the middle left panel of fig .",
    "6 . in this case",
    ", the ms of the isochrone is clearly offset from the observed one for @xmath13@xmath535.0 .",
    "another exception , though not as obvious , is apparent in the comparison between the y@xmath0 models and the m35 data in the upper right panel of fig . 6 .",
    "again , the isochrone is brighter than the data in the range 2.0@xmath53@xmath13@xmath535.0 .",
    "thirdly , there is the comparison between ngc 2420 and the siess models in fig .",
    "10 where the theoretical ms lies above the data .",
    "it is unclear what these mismatches are due to .",
    "however , in the case of the geneva models , it may be a result of the fact that the cluster ( m35 ) metallicity is lower than those used in the isochrones .",
    "for the clusters whose photometry extends reliably below @xmath13@xmath68.0 ( ngc 2477 and m67 , again excluding m37 ) , we find that the padova and baraffe models diverge the most from the observed main sequences while the y@xmath0 and siess models deviate the least .",
    "note that the geneva model ms does not extend faint enough for this comparison to be made .    moving on to a consideration of the [ @xmath2 diagrams in figs .",
    "12 through 16 , we see a similar behaviour in the range 2.0@xmath53@xmath13@xmath537.0 as noted in the case of the @xmath15 cmds . in short ,",
    "all of the models perform reasonably well in matching the observed main sequences .",
    "the difficulties arise in the magnitude ranges fainter than @xmath13@xmath68.0 ; the padova models diverge the most from the cluster main sequences , while the baraffe theoretical main sequences reproduce the observed ones more consistently than any of other sets .",
    "lastly , we examine the [ @xmath3 diagrams which were constructed by matching optical photometry with 2mass near - ir photometry .",
    "we note that the level of agreement between the isochrones and the data at @xmath13=6.0 is not consistent from cluster to cluster and model to model . with the exception of m37 where the distance fits",
    "have been performed in the [ @xmath3 plane , in most cases , the model main sequences are fainter than the observed ones .",
    "however , the padova ms matches that of m35 at @xmath13=6.0 ; similarly , the geneva models match the ms of ngc 2477 at @xmath13=6.0 . in terms of the level of overall agreement along the ms",
    ", we can say that , like the @xmath15 and @xmath12 cmds , the @xmath14 models perform better in the range 2.0@xmath53@xmath13@xmath537.0 as compared to fainter magnitudes .",
    "however , with the exception of m35 , the models are generally fainter than the observational main sequences .",
    "to conclude this section , we note that _ none _ of the theoretical models fit the unevolved ms ( i.e. @xmath13@xmath544 ) adequately in all three colours .",
    "either the shape of the isochrone does not match the observations or the location does not match or both . the small difference between",
    "the metallicity of the isochrones and the observations is unlikely to be the cause of this mismatch .",
    "one of the ways in which we can eliminate the use of the distance modulus in the present analysis is to compare the optical / ir photometry of open clusters with theoretical isochrones in the two - colour diagram ( tcd ) . in this plane",
    ", only the reddenings of the clusters are required allowing us to further investigate the robustness of the models .",
    "figures 23 through 28 show the @xmath4 $ ] tcds while figs .",
    "29 through 33 display the @xmath5 $ ] tcds for main sequence stars in our sample of open clusters .",
    "the arrow in each figure represents the slope of the reddening vector ( @xmath55 ) which is roughly parallel to the two - colour sequence suggesting that inferences made from these diagrams are largely insensitive to the adopted reddenings .    looking first at the @xmath4 $ ] diagrams , except in a minority of cases ,",
    "there is a zeropoint offset between the theoretical two - colour sequence and the observations ; the models are too blue in @xmath14 at a given @xmath15 as compared with the observational data . in addition , the detailed shapes of the theoretical sequences can be dramatically different than the data especially in the case of the baraffe models for @xmath14@xmath543.0 .",
    "the m37 and m67 data , which extend to the reddest colours , nicely underscore these shape differences .",
    "largely similar conclusions ( i.e. models are offset to bluer colours and do nt reproduce the shape of the observed tcds ) can be reached by examining the @xmath5 $ ] diagrams .    as a sanity check on the observations , figs .",
    "34 and 35 present tcds of each cluster compared with the sequence for m35 determined by eye using the data in the upper left panels . a reddening vector equal to @xmath55",
    "is also shown in each figure .",
    "we see that in most cases , the positions and shapes of the two - colour sequences for each cluster are in good accord with that of m35 . in fig .",
    "34 , the data for m37 are below the m35 line by @xmath60.1 mag ; this may account for the fact that in the [ @xmath1 cmds ( fig .",
    "7 ) , the m37 data is shifted away from the isochrones by a significant amount as compared with the data from the other clusters .",
    "figure 34 also shows that the m67 two - colour data appears to be slightly offset from the m35 sequence in the colour range 0.5@xmath53@xmath15@xmath531.0 .",
    "lastly , in fig . 35",
    ", we see that the m67 sequence has a slightly different shape as compared with the m35 @xmath5 $ ] line . taken together , the tcds in fig .",
    "34 and 35 provide reassurance that the observational data we have considered herein are internally consistent .",
    "we have presented combined optical / near - ir photometry for six open clusters .",
    "the optical data have been obtained as part of the wiyn open cluster study and taken from the literature , while the near - ir observations are from the second incremental data release of the two micron all sky survey point source catalog .",
    "the open clusters span an age range from 150 myr to 4 gyr and have metal abundances from [ fe / h ] = 0.27 to + 0.09 dex .",
    "we have utilized these data to test the robustness of theoretical main sequences constructed by several groups as denoted by the following designations - padova ( girardi et al .",
    "2002 ) , baraffe ( baraffe et al . 1998 ) , y@xmath0 ( yi et al . 2001 ) , geneva ( lejeune & schaerer 2001 ) , and siess ( siess et al . 2000 ) . the comparisons of the models with the observations have been performed in the [ @xmath1 , [ @xmath2 , and [ @xmath3 colour - magnitude diagrams as well as the distance - independent @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] two - colour diagrams .",
    "the reddenings have been taken from twarog et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and the distance moduli were determined by adopting these reddenings and then matching each isochrone to the observed main sequences at @xmath13=6.0 in the [ @xmath2 plane ( [ @xmath3 for m37 ) .",
    "we conclude that none of the theoretical models reproduce the observational data in a consistent manner over the magnitude and colour range of the unevolved main sequence .",
    "in particular , there are significant zeropoint and shape differences between the models and the observations . in the colour - magnitude diagrams ,",
    "most of the models performed reasonably well for stars with mass@xmath540.75@xmath48 , but did not do so for stars with lower masses . in the two - colour diagrams ,",
    "the theoretical sequences are too blue in @xmath14 at a given @xmath15 and @xmath12 as compared with the observational data .",
    "the shapes of the theoretical sequences can also be dramatically different as compared with the data . from figs . 4 and 5 we can say with a fair amount of certainty that the crux of the problem lies in the precise mismatch between theoretical and observational colour - temperature relations . depending on how these relations are derived ,",
    "one of the problems could be missing sources of opacity in the atmospheres of the model stars .",
    "these results underscore the importance of pursuing the study of stellar structure and stellar modelling with even greater intensity .",

    "<S> we present combined optical / near - ir photometry ( bvik ) for six open clusters - m35 , m37 , ngc 1817 , ngc 2477 , ngc 2420 , and m67 . </S>",
    "<S> the open clusters span an age range from 150 myr to 4 gyr and have metal abundances from [ fe / h ] = 0.3 to + 0.09 dex . </S>",
    "<S> we have utilized these data to test the robustness of theoretical main sequences constructed by several groups as denoted by the following designations - padova , baraffe , y@xmath0 , geneva , and siess . </S>",
    "<S> the comparisons of the models with the observations have been performed in the [ @xmath1 , [ @xmath2 , and [ @xmath3 colour - magnitude diagrams as well as the distance - independent @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] two - colour diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that none of the theoretical models reproduce the observational data in a consistent manner over the magnitude and colour range of the unevolved main sequence . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , there are significant zeropoint and shape differences between the models and the observations . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the crux of the problem lies in the precise mismatch between theoretical and observational colour - temperature relations . </S>",
