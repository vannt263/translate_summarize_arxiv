    "inventories of massive o - type stars in the galaxy show that @xmath270% of them are associated with ob associations or clusters , and that more than 1/3 of the remaining 30% are runaway ob stars @xcite .",
    "these results imply that less than 20% of galactic o - type stars were formed in isolation .",
    "recently , the origin of 43 field stars from the @xcite sample of 227 o stars with @xmath3 8 has been investigated : deep images show that 5 of them are in small clusters @xcite , and analysis of their location and space velocities suggests that 22 are likely runaways @xcite .",
    "only 1020 of the sample of 227 bright galactic o stars can not be assigned to any ob associations or clusters , indicating that 510% of the galactic o stars are truly isolated ( zinnecker & yorke 2007 ) .",
    "the formation of isolated massive stars is of great interest .",
    "while studies of galactic o stars have yielded important results on the fraction of o stars formed in isolation , it is not known under what interstellar conditions isolated massive stars are formed or why field stars have steeper initial mass functions ( imfs ) than ob associations @xcite . to answer these questions",
    ", we need to examine young massive stars before their energy feedback has significantly altered the ambient interstellar conditions and dispersed the natal clouds .",
    "it is also necessary to inventory young massive stars in an entire galaxy to gain statistical insights .",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "observations of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) provide an ideal dataset to study young massive stars .",
    "the lmc is at a distance of 50 kpc ( distance modulus = 18.5 ) , where 1@xmath4 corresponds to 0.25 pc .",
    "its nearly face - on orientation allows a clear view of the entire galaxy with little confusion and extinction along the line - of - sight .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations are able to resolve individual stars in the mid - ir for the first time @xcite .",
    "we have used our deep irac and mips observations of seven lmc hii complexes from _ spitzer _",
    "cycle 1 and the sage survey of the entire lmc from cycle 2 @xcite to identify massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the lmc .",
    "we have retrieved the above mentioned _",
    "observations of the lmc , and carried out photometry for all point sources in the four irac bands and three mips bands . the mips 70 and 160 @xmath5 m data are less useful because of their poor angular resolution .",
    "the sage survey of the lmc contains observations made in two epochs .",
    "photometric measurements were made for each epoch separately , compared to reject transients and spurious sources , and combined to improve signal - to - noise ratios . to check our method of photometric measurements",
    ", we have retrieved the _",
    "spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic ( swire ) legacy survey @xcite data and made our measurements ; we find general consistency between our and their results .    the photometric measurements in irac bands and mips 24 @xmath5 m band were used to assemble various diagnostic color - color and color - magnitude diagrams ( ccds and cmds ) .",
    "among these , the most informative is the [ 8.0 ] vs [ 4.5]@xmath6[8.0 ] cmd . in figure 1",
    "we present such cmds for all point sources in the lmc ( left panel ) and in the swire survey ( right panel ) for comparison .",
    "the swire cmd shows a vertical branch of stars of which the upper part bends to the right owing to the artifact that the brightest stars are saturated in the 4.5 @xmath5 m band , as well as a concentration of galaxies .",
    "the cmd of the lmc is much more complex , as it contains normal stars with zero color , evolved stars with ir excess , ysos with ir excess , and background galaxies .    to select yso candidates in the lmc",
    ", we first adopt the galaxy discriminator suggested by @xcite  the tilted dashed line in figure 1 . as shown in the swire cmd , this discriminator is indeed an effective upper boundary for most background galaxies .",
    "to exclude normal stars and evolved stars , we adopt a color cutoff of [ 4.5]@xmath6[8.0 ] @xmath7 2.0 . in the lmc cmd , we have overplotted the expected locations of 3000 @xmath8 asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and post - agb stars from @xcite ; it is evident that our discriminator does exclude most of the normal and agb / post - agb stars .",
    "finally , we adopt the [ 8.0 ] @xmath9 8 criterion to select massive ysos with masses greater than @xmath210 @xmath1 @xcite . as show in figure 1 ,",
    "the massive yso candidates are in the upper right corner of the cmd ; however , some agb and post - agb stars are still expected to occupy this region .    to determine the true nature of the massive yso candidates , it is necessary to examine their images and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) carefully . our approach is illustrated in figure 2 , where ds9 is used to display a large - scale h@xmath10 image overplotted with co contours , and close - up images in digitized sky survey red ( dss2r ) , h@xmath10 , 2mass @xmath11 and @xmath12 , irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath5 m , and mips 24 and 70 @xmath5 m , alongside plots showing the yso candidate s sed and location in the [ 8.0 ] vs [ 4.5]@xmath6[8.0 ] cmd .",
    "the h@xmath10 images are from the magellanic cloud emission line survey ( mcels , smith et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the co contours are from the nanten survey @xcite . by examining these images and plots , we can easily identify foreground stars , agb / post - agb stars , and bright galaxies . after eliminating these contaminating sources ,",
    "we are left with 234 probable ( high - confidence ) and 14 possible ( @xmath250% probability ) massive ysos .",
    "details of the _ spitzer _ photometric measurements and selection of massive ysos will be reported by gruendl & chu ( 2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "massive stars are often born in complex environments and the _ spitzer _ resolution is inadequate to show the detail .",
    "the 2mass images are also of limited usefulness .",
    "we have thus used the infrared sideport imager ( ispi ) on the 4 m blanco telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory to obtain deeper @xmath11 and @xmath12 images with higher angular resolution .",
    "the necessity of such high - resolution images is illustrated in figure 3 , where close - up images of the object shown in figure 2 are displayed .",
    "the near - ir counterpart of this source appear unresolved in the 2mass @xmath11 and @xmath12 images , but is resolved into a diffuse source and two point sources in the ispi @xmath11 and @xmath12 images , with one source being significantly brighter in @xmath12 than in @xmath11 .",
    "this example fully demonstrates the danger in blindly modeling the sed of a yso in the lmc for its physical properties without using high - resolution images to examine the multiplicity of the yso .",
    "on a global scale , massive star formation is associated with gravitational instability .",
    "the gravitational instability of the lmc has been analyzed by @xcite considering the gas disk only and considering both the collisional gas and the collisionless stars in the disk .",
    "they find that only 62% of the _ spitzer _ sample of massive ysos fall in gravitationally unstable regions for the former , and 85% for the latter .",
    "the most visible difference between these two cases is along the star - forming stellar bar of the lmc , which is largely stable for the gas - only disk and unstable in the gas+star disk .",
    "it is thus important that the contribution of stars is included in the calculation of gravitational instability .",
    "for the 234 probable and 14 possible massive ysos in the lmc , we mark the yso positions in h@xmath10 images overplotted with co contours to examine their stellar and interstellar environments .",
    "we compare the yso location with the ob associations compiled by @xcite , hii regions cataloged by @xcite and @xcite , and giant molecular clouds identified from nanten survey by @xcite .",
    "the results are compiled in a table for further statistical analysis .    among the 248 probable and possible massive ysos in the lmc , @xmath265%",
    "are in ob associations , most of which are surrounded by superbubbles or bright hii regions .",
    "figure 4 shows examples of massive ysos in or near ob associations in superbubbles .",
    "it is evident that star formation continues into the molecular clouds near ob associations , and most likely the expansion of the superbubble plays a significant role in the propagation of star formation .",
    "low - level star formation exists within the superbubble where no molecular material is detected by the nanten survey ; these are probably pc - sized dust globules compressed by the photoionized surface layer ( i.e. , photo - implosion or globule - squeezing ) , as illustrated by the ysos in the superbubble n51d @xcite .    about 85% of the massive ysos in the lmc",
    "are formed in giant molecular clouds .",
    "interestingly , some massive ysos are located within giant molecular clouds but are also on the peripheries of supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "figure 5 shows two examples .",
    "while it is possible that the expansion of the snr triggered the star formation , it is also possible that the star formation was triggered by the bubble blown by the supernova progenitor s fast wind during the main sequence phase and the subsequent snr is largely confined within the bubble . to distinguish between these two possibilities , velocities of the snr shell and the superposed molecular cloud need to be compared .",
    "bubble expansion velocities are expected to be small , @xmath920 km  s@xmath13 , while snr shocks are expected to be @xmath0100 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "an absence of high velocities in the molecular material would suggest that the expanding wind - blown bubble was responsible for triggering the star formation .",
    "the massive ysos that are not in ob associations may be associated with giant molecular clouds , as shown in the top row of figure 6 .",
    "it is very likely that the stellar energy feedback of these first - generation massive stars will trigger further star formation , resulting in an ob association or a cluster .",
    "only massive ysos formed in an environment without a large reservoir of molecular gas may become truly isolated massive stars , for example , the ysos shown in the bottom row of figure 6 . among the massive ysos in the lmc , only @xmath27% are neither in ob associations nor associated with giant molcular clouds .",
    "these will evolve into isolated massive stars .",
    "this fraction is consistent with the finding for galactic o - type stars  only 5 - 10% are truly isolated .",
    "it should be noted that the isolated massive ysos are in general less luminous , and hence less massive , than those in active star forming regions .",
    "detailed comparisons of yso properties for different environments are still underway .",
