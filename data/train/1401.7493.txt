    "in recent years local heating with an infrared laser has widely used for confining or sieving macromolecules or colloidal particles in aqueous solution @xcite .",
    "these works rely on the drift velocity @xmath124 imposed by the temperature gradient .",
    "various physical mechanisms have been discussed @xcite ; in the present context the most relevant are @xmath125where @xmath126 is the surface potential , @xmath127 the solvent permittivity , and @xmath128  the viscosity .    in a macroscopic system ,",
    "the thermoelectric field is strictly proportional to the temperature gradient , @xmath4 , such that ( [ 74 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath129where the thermophoretic mobility @xmath130 is taken as a constant @xcite .",
    "the first term in @xmath130 arises from the thermoosmotic salt - ion flow around a collodial bead ; it was first derived by ruckenstein @xcite and drives the solute particle to the cold . the second term in ( [ 74 ] ) accounts for electrophoresis in the seebeck field @xmath1 .",
    "in the last few years it has become clear that this thermoelectric effect contributes significantly to collodial thermophoresis and in many cases is even dominant @xcite .",
    "the velocity may even change its sign with the seebeck coefficient : this means that negatively charged colloidal particles or sds micelles move to the warm in naoh ( @xmath9 ) and to the cold in nacl ( @xmath131 ) . as a consequence , the colloid accumulates or is depleted , respectively .      for a micron - size hot spot in a very weak electrolyte ,",
    "the debye length is of the same order of magnitude of the spot size",
    ". then the thermoelectric properties do not reduce to the macroscopic seebeck field @xmath132 but result in a significantly more involved relation ( [ 61 ] ) between @xmath1 and @xmath133 . as the most striking feature of fig .",
    "2 , moderate or large values of @xmath73 strongly reduce the thermoelectric field in the heated area , yet are of no effect at larger distances .    .",
    "from below the curves are calculated with @xmath103 . ]    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the spatial variation of the drift velocity @xmath124 of a colloidal solute in naoh solution , for different values of the ratio @xmath134 . because of the negative seebeck coefficient of naoh , the thermoelectric field is opposite to the temperature gradient .",
    "thus for a negatively charged solute , the two terms in ( [ 74 ] ) carry opposite signs : the ruckenstein mechanism drives the solute toward the cold , whereas the seebeck contribution points to the origin of the heated spot . for small @xmath134 and with the numbers of table 1 , the seebeck term is dominant everywhere , and the solute migrates to higher temperature @xmath135 .",
    "as the ratio @xmath136 increases , the field @xmath1 decreases below @xmath137 within the heated area , yet remains unaffected at @xmath138 where @xmath139 . as a consequence , the first term in ( [ 74 ] ) dominates at at small distances .",
    "accordingly , the solute migrates outward at small @xmath2 , and in the opposite direction at larger distances ; thus the solute accumulates where @xmath124 vanishes .",
    "a similar effect has been shown to result from the competition between thermophoresis and depletion forces @xcite .     for different values of the ratio @xmath140 . from below the curves",
    "are calculated with @xmath141 .",
    "the lowest one corresponds to the mobility @xmath130 defined in ( [ 76 ] ) ]    in order to single out the relative variation of the thermoelectric field , we plot in fig .",
    "4 the ratio of the velocity @xmath124 and the underlying thermodynamic force @xmath133 . the lowest curve is calculated with @xmath142 , in other words with the seebeck field @xmath132 ; the constant value @xmath143 gives the usual thermophoretic mobility of the colloid .",
    "as @xmath73 increases , the ratio between @xmath124 and @xmath133 is no longer constant , and the thermoelectric contribution is reduced within the heated spot and in its immediate vicinity . for large @xmath73 and at short distances ,",
    "the thermoelectric field is negligible and @xmath144 tends toward the ( positive ) value of ruckenstein contribution in ( [ 74 ] ) .",
    "as the distance @xmath2 increases , the ratio @xmath144 changes sign and finally converges to the mobility @xmath130 .      in the preceding discussion",
    "we have assumed that the coefficients of @xmath145 in ( [ 74 ] ) and ( [ 76 ] ) are constant in the heated spot and beyond .",
    "it is well known that the properties of both solute and solvent ( viscosity , permittivity , seebeck parameter , @xmath126-potential ) vary with temperature , in addition to the explicit appearance of @xmath19 in ( [ 74 ] ) .",
    "an estimate for real systems shows the largest dependencies occur for the viscosity and seebeck coefficient ; their logarithmic derivatives @xmath146 and @xmath147 are of the order of 0.02 k@xmath148 @xcite , which means that an excess temperature of 10 k results in a change of about 20 percent .",
    "there are however , several good reasons for discarding this variation when calculating the drift velocity @xmath124 .",
    "\\(i ) these corrections are formally similar to those neglected in the linearization approximation of ( [ 44 ] ) . retaining the former and",
    "discarding the latter would be inconsistent .",
    "( ii ) if the temperature dependence of viscosity and permittivity are rather well known and thus could be taken into account , this is not the case for the seebeck coefficient @xmath7 nor for the @xmath126-potential : there is some evidence that the ionic soret parameters @xmath22 , and thus @xmath7 , are correlatedwith the thermal expansivity of water @xcite ; unfortunately there are little data , and a satisfactory theory for the seebeck coefficient is lacking so far .",
    "regarding the surface potential @xmath126 , its complex temperature dependence is due to the boundary - layer electrostatics and the dissociation of the charged molecular units . in view of these poorly understood dependencies , characterizing the variation of thermoelectric properties with temperature would seem a rather difficult undertaking .    though not insignificant , these variations are of little relevance for the present discussion , which focusses on the order of magnitude of the thermoelectric effect and on its sign",
    ". thus the coefficients of @xmath133 in ( [ 74 ] ) and ( [ 76 ] ) are calculated with constant @xmath149 , and @xmath19 .",
    "this is why the mobility @xmath130 , that is , the lowest curve of fig .",
    "4 , does not vary with the distance .      the drift velocity ( [ 74 ] ) and ( [ 76 ] ) has been calculated in the dilute limit , where the seebeck field @xmath1 is determined by the salt ions but independent of the colloidal charges . here",
    "a word is in order concerning the back - reaction of the latter on the thermoelectric properties . in a recent work @xcite",
    "we have shown that for polyelectrolytes , collective effects set at a volume fraction @xmath150 , where @xmath151   is the bjerrum length and @xmath152 the gyration radius .",
    "a slightly more complex expression occurs for colloidal particles , because of their cooperative diffusion .",
    "comparison with several experiments suggests that collective effects occur at rather moderately dense suspensions , requiring to go beyond the single - particle picture ( [ 74 ] ) .",
    "this is certainly the case in accumulation experiments where thermophoresis contributes to colloidal confinement @xcite .",
    "the analytic results of this paper rely essentially on linearizing the differential equation ( [ 44 ] ) in terms of excess temperature and modulation of ion densities . though much higher values can be achieved experimentally @xcite , typical values for @xmath153",
    "are of the order of tens of kelvin , thus satisfying the first inequality in ( [ 20 ] ) . regarding the ion densities ,",
    "a first estimate is obtained by noting that their modulation is of the order @xmath154 ; the parameters @xmath22 taking values of the order of unity @xcite , a small excess temperature implies a small change of the ion densities .    since the thermally induced charge density @xmath155 is a central quantity , we discuss in some detail the fraction @xmath156 of salt ions involved .",
    "we start with the case of small debye length @xmath157 . inserting the definition @xmath158 in ( [ 65 ] )",
    "we find up to a numerical constant @xmath159according to the numbers of table i , the first factor on the right - hand side is of the order of unity , which just means @xmath160 .",
    "both of the remaining factors is small however , resulting in @xmath161 .",
    "as an example , we consider the parameters of fig .",
    "2 with @xmath162m@xmath163 ; for comparison , the ion density of a 1 mm / l electrolyte solution , @xmath164m@xmath163 , is by five orders of magnitude larger than the net charge density . for the case where the debye length exceeds the size of the hot spot , @xmath165 , one finds a relation similar to ( [ 72 ] ) , albeit without the factor @xmath166 .",
    "again , for typical excess temperatures @xmath167k , the net charge density turns out to be by almost two orders of magnitude smaller than salinity .",
    "thus the inequality @xmath168holds independently of the ratio @xmath73 .",
    "this means that thermal charge separation involves only a small fraction of the ion density .    on the other hand",
    ", this inequaltiy implies the second relation of ( [ 20 ] ) . writing the charge density as @xmath169 and noting that it is dominated by the ion species with the larger heat of transfer parameter @xmath22 , for example @xmath170 in the case of naoh ( @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) , we find that @xmath173 implies the concentration change of both cations and anions to be small .",
    "these estimates confirm the validity of the linearization approximation for the fundamental equation ( [ 44 ] ) .",

    "we find that the thermo - charge density @xmath155 is proportional to the heating power , as shown in ( [ 15 ] ) for the general case and in ( [ 65 ] ) for a gaussian heating profile .",
    "a more complex situation occurs if @xmath72 is not small as compared to the size of the heated domain",

    "this is best answered in term of the pclet number , @xmath192 that compares the convection velocity with diffusion over the characteristic length @xmath71 . with the einstein coefficient of common ions @xmath193 m@xmath188/s and @xmath189 m",
    ", one finds @xmath194 @xmath6 m/s and a pclet number of about 5% . in physical terms",
    "this means that the salt ions diffuse sufficiently rapidly , such that the charge profile @xmath155 and the thermoelectric field @xmath1 are hardly affected by convection .",
    "a different picture arises for  a colloidal suspension .",
    "because of the much smaller einstein coefficient , @xmath195 m@xmath188/s for 100 nm beads , the pclet number is larger than unity and diffusion is much slower than advection @xcite .",
    "the interplay between diffusion , convection , and thermophoresis has been used in thermal traps and separation devices @xcite .",
    "finally we note that the present work deals with a stationary temperature profile .",
    "additional flows arise from time - dependent heating , as illustrated by experiments using thermoviscous expansion @xcite .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of non - spherical geometries . in most cases",
    "the laser intensity @xmath13 has no spherical symmetry , that is , it shows different profiles parallel and perpendicular to the beam axis , and so does the excess temperature .",
    "then ( [ 49 ] ) and ( [ 11a ] ) do not reduce to a single radial equation .",
    "still , if the spatial variation of @xmath19 is slow on the scale of the debye length , @xmath196 , the thermoelectric field follows the temperature gradient according to the macroscopic law @xmath132 . as an important result , eqs .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) are valid for any sufficienlty smooth heating profile ; this implies in particular the existence of the thermocharge ( [ 66 ] ) , with some characteristic length @xmath71 .",
    "thus the analysis of sect . 2 is valid for any smooth temperature profile .",
    "the results obtained in sects 3 and 4 , however , and in particular the electric field ( [ 61 ] ) and the thermophoretic velocity ( [ 76 ] ) , rely on the spherical symmetry of both thermal and electric properties .",
    "significant deviations occur for a non - spherical heated spot that is not much larger than the debye length , or for an electrolyte that is confined by a solid boundary .",
    "we briefly discuss the latter situation .",
    "we consider a confined electrolyte solution , where the ratio of the permittivities of water @xmath127 and the insulating boundary @xmath197 constitutes a most important parameter ; for typical materials one has @xmath198 .",
    "the upper panel of fig . 5 shows a heated spot at a liquid - solid or liquid - liquid interface .",
    "though this geometry does not allow for a general solution of the thermoelectric equations , qualitative features are readily obtained by comparing with results for a discrete surface charge @xmath0 for02 . estimating the ion pressure and the maxwell stress tensor @xmath199 in the framework of debye - hckel theory , one finds a normal stress component @xmath200 that pushes the interface toward the electrolyte ; the resulting force  on the heated spot , @xmath201 , is counterbalanced by the opposite stress on the outside area @xcite .",
    "this thermoelectric stress could contribute to the temperature - driven forces on droplets that are used for optothermal actuation in microfluidic devices @xcite .",
    "even more striking effects are expected to occur in a locally heated thin aqueous film , as illustrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "5 . the ratio of the film thickness @xmath202 and the size @xmath71 of the hot spot provide an important parameter for the thermoelectric equations . for @xmath203",
    "one recovers the bulk behavior studied in this paper , whereas a rather different picture arises in the opposite case @xmath204 .",
    "the permittivity jump at the interfaces confines the electric field lines and results in a strongly non - uniform relation between @xmath1 and @xmath133 , similar to that discussed above for the ratio @xmath73 . according to our preliminary results",
    ", this confinement could be relevant for the thermophoretic mobility observed for thin - film geometries @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarize our main results on the thermoelectric properties of a locally heated spot in an electrolyte solution .",
    "\\(i ) for a smooth temperature profile , that varies little within one debye length , the seebeck field ( [ 14 ] ) and the thermocharge density ( [ 15 ] ) are proportional to the temperature gradient and laser intensity , respectively .",
    "these results does not rely on a particular geometry but hold true in general .",
    "\\(iii ) laser heating can be used for designing local electric fields of the order of kv / m , without electrodes or other material in the electrolyte solution . this thermoelectric field is not screened and , beyond the heated spot ,",
    "decays with the square of the inverse distanc .",
    "\\(iv ) in recent years , thermal gradients have been used for accumulating or depleting colloidal solutes in a hot spot .",
    "the seebeck field derived here could contribute significantly to the thermodynamic forces observed experimentally , and provide an qualitative picture for situations where convection is of little relevance , for example in confined micron - size films .",
    "regarding thermoconvection , which is present in a bulk system , we find that salt ions are hardly affected ( small pclet number ) , whereasthe stationary state of colloidal solutes is to a large extent determined by advection ."
