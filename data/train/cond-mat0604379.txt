    "the concept of universality class , which has been undoubtedly one of the central issues in equilibrium physics , is widely believed to hold in some range of non - equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "that is , even far from equilibrium , many microscopic details of systems become irrelevant at transition points , and a set of critical exponents depends only on a small number of basic , macroscopic ingredients .",
    "the `` basic ingredients '' comprise , e.g. , spatial dimension , symmetries and conservation laws , as in equilibrium systems , but then it is natural to ask `` do there exist any additional relevant parameters intrinsic to non - equilibrium ? '' the ising universality class is also observed in non - equilibrium systems .",
    "for example , probabilistic cellular automata ( pcas ) and coupled map lattices ( cmls ) with up - down symmetry can exhibit ising - like transitions by varying a control parameter such as a coupling constant .",
    "@xcite showed that , suppose a coarse - grained dynamics of such systems is described by a langevin equation , irreversibility due to the broken detailed balance is irrelevant and the considered models should fall in the ising class , using the standard dynamic renormalization group treatment . this prediction has been actually confirmed in various kinetic ising models with asynchronously updating rules @xcite",
    ". however , marcq _ et al . _",
    "@xcite numerically found that ising - like transitions of some two - dimensional non - equilibrium cmls separate into _ two _ distinct universality classes : the ising class , and a new universality class , called `` non - ising class '' hereafter , where the correlation length exponent @xmath0 is @xmath1 [ here number(s ) between parentheses indicate the uncertainty in the last digit(s ) of the quantity ] , which differs from the ising value @xmath2 .",
    "ratios of exponents @xmath3 and @xmath4 are common to the two classes , namely @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "since cmls with synchronously updating rules form the new class , whereas asynchronously updated ones belong to the ising class , synchronism is thought to be a relevant parameter . after their work ,",
    "several synchronous systems such as stochastic cmls @xcite , a logistic cml at the onset of a non - trivial collective behavior @xcite , and even pcas @xcite have been investigated and the existence of the non - ising class has been observed again , aside from a few exceptions @xcite .",
    "thus the importance of synchronism , which may be related to the existence of an external clock , has been attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "however , it is obvious that the synchronous updating does _ not _ immediately bring about the non - ising critical behavior : there exist synchronous pcas which respect the detailed balance and therefore we can safely say that they belong to the ising class , thanks to the equilibrium universality hypothesis .",
    "for example , an isotropic pca with a glauber transition rate satisfies that condition . on the other hand , a glauber pca with completely anisotropic interaction was numerically studied by makowiec and gnaciski ( mg ) @xcite , and concluded to be in the non - ising class .",
    "the above two observations naturally lead to a supposition that a degree of anisotropy may affect the selection of the universality classes .",
    "the aim of this paper is , therefore , to examine the relation between anisotropy and the universality classes .",
    "two series of pcas with up - down symmetry , namely glauber pcas and majority - vote pcas , are numerically investigated .",
    "both of them are on a two - dimensional , square lattice of size @xmath7 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a local variable , or `` spin , '' @xmath8 is assigned to each lattice point , where indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote cartesian coordinates , and @xmath11 is the discrete time .",
    "each site @xmath12 is simultaneously updated according to a specific local transition probability @xmath13 that the spin takes a value @xmath14 after one time step from a spin configuration @xmath15 . for the glauber pcas",

    "we can realize a variety of glauber pcas with different degrees of anisotropy by varying the value of @xmath19 .",
    "an isotropic case corresponds to @xmath20 , in which it is easily shown that the detailed balance is satisfied with stationary distribution @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an effective hamiltonian and @xmath23 is a normalization constant .",
    "since the hamiltonian respects the up - down symmetry and consists only of short - range interactions , the equilibrium universality hypothesis asserts that this isotropic glauber pca should fall in the ising class despite the synchronous updating scheme . on the other hand",
    ", the detailed balance does not hold for @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , the completely anisotropic case @xmath25 is already reported by mg to have the exponent @xmath26 and to belong to the non - ising class @xcite .",
    "the other series of pcas is that of majority - vote pcas , defined as @xmath27 \\}.",
    "\\label{eq:2.3}\\ ] ] for this model , the degree of anisotropy is classified into only 3 types : completely anisotropic @xmath28 , intermediate @xmath29 , and isotropic @xmath30 .",
    "the detailed balance is violated in all of them @xcite .",
    "the completely anisotropic case is well - known as the toom pca @xcite , whose exponent was also estimated by mg to be @xmath31 , i.e. the non - ising value @xcite .",
    "all of the simulations are implemented on lattices of size up to @xmath32 by the following procedure .",
    "we start from random initial conditions and discard first @xmath33 time steps as transients .",
    "it is sufficiently long to consider the systems in the time - asymptotic attractor , since the correlation time is @xmath34 in the worst case",
    ". then time series of the averaged spin @xmath35 is used to calculate the magnetization @xmath36 , higher order moments @xmath37 , the susceptibility @xmath38 and the binder s cumulant @xmath39 @xcite , defined by @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the expectation value obtained by integrating an observable during the duration @xmath42 , such as @xmath43 .",
    "absolute values of @xmath44 are taken in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3.1 ] ) as usual , since finite - size effects allow sign reversals of the instantaneous magnetization even in the ordered phase .",
    "the integration time @xmath42 is @xmath45 for the isotropic glauber pca and @xmath46 for the others , and thus much longer than both the correlation time @xmath47 and the sign reversal time @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the quantities in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3.1 ] ) are capable of representing the corresponding ensemble averages with good accuracy .",
    "critical exponents @xmath49 are estimated for the glauber pcas with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and the majority - vote pcas with @xmath50 , @xmath52 , @xmath54 .",
    "the way of measurement is almost similar to that of marcq _ et al .",
    "_ and later works @xcite , that is , to exploit finite - size scaling laws in equilibrium which are empirically known to hold in the non - equilibrium ising - like transitions .",
    "the following shows the process of measurement for the glauber pca with @xmath55 as a typical case .",
    "the first to do is to find the critical point @xmath56 . in order to locate it ,",
    "we adopt the standard method using the binder s cumulant @xmath57 @xcite . since the cumulant has the scaling form of @xmath58 , it becomes independent of @xmath59 at criticality , i.e. @xmath60 for all @xmath59 .",
    "the quantity @xmath61 is also a universal number .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows plots of @xmath57 and their polynomial fitting curves for various system sizes .     of intersections between curves @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the intersections are located by fitting raw data with polynomials of orders @xmath64 to @xmath65 , and superimposed on the same figure .",
    "the range of the orders is chosen so that the fitting curves adequately trace the raw data .",
    "the broken line indicates the linear regression , whose y - intercept yields an estimate of @xmath66 .",
    "( [ eq:4.2 ] ) . ]     of intersections between curves @xmath62 and @xmath63 . the intersections are located by fitting raw data with polynomials of orders @xmath64 to @xmath65 , and superimposed on the same figure . the range of the orders is chosen so that the fitting curves adequately trace the raw data .",
    "the broken line indicates the linear regression , whose y - intercept yields an estimate of @xmath66 .",
    "( [ eq:4.2 ] ) . ]    focussing on intersections between them , a drift toward larger values of @xmath17 is clearly observed ( the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "this is caused by remaining contributions of irrelevant operators , which exist in finite - size systems @xcite .",
    "taking it into consideration , the scaling function of the cumulant should be modified to @xmath67 , where only one irrelevant term with a relaxation exponent @xmath68 is assumed to be dominant .",
    "an expansion of the modified scaling form in powers of @xmath69 and @xmath70 up to the 1st order yields the coordinate of the intersection between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , namely , @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are expansion coefficients . consequently , by plotting @xmath17 with respect to @xmath74 for fixed , reasonable values of @xmath68 and @xmath0 , and by searching for @xmath68 which gives the highest correlation coefficient for it , we obtain estimates of both @xmath68 and @xmath66 .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] is a plot for @xmath75 and the best value of @xmath68 , where we can clearly see the linear dependence , which gives the coefficient of determination @xmath76 .",
    "the critical point @xmath66 is then estimated as a y - intercept of the regression line , @xmath77 in this case . here",
    ", the superscript ( subscript ) indicates the confidence interval in the plus ( minus ) direction , which is evaluated as the region with sufficiently large coefficient of determination , namely , @xmath78 .",
    "the estimation of @xmath61 is carried out quite similarly , which results in @xmath79 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the 2d - ising value @xmath80 @xcite",
    ". a problem of this method may be that it requires the value of @xmath0 , which is measured later , but the difference in the estimates with respect to the assumed value of @xmath0 , @xmath81 or @xmath82 , turns out to be quite subtle : @xmath83 for @xmath66 and @xmath84 for @xmath61 , i.e. negligible .",
    "the mentioned improvement is therefore useful and expected to lead to more reliable estimation of critical exponents .",
    "now we proceed to the measurement of critical exponents .",
    "the following finite - size scaling relations are made use of to achieve it :    @xmath85 ^ 2/[m^4 ] \\sim l^{1/\\nu } , & & v_4 \\equiv ( [ m]^4/[m^4])^{1/3 } \\sim l^{1/\\nu } ,   \\notag \\\\   & v_6 \\equiv [ m]^2/[m^2 ] \\sim l^{1/\\nu } ,   \\label{eq:4.3a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath86 [ eq:4.3 ]    where @xmath87 \\equiv { \\partial}_g m_l^{(n)}|_{g_c}$ ] , and the derivatives are evaluated by using polynomial fittings of appropriate orders .",
    "irrelevant operators can affect the scaling relations ( [ eq:4.3 ] ) again .",
    "we , therefore , perform the measurement as follows .",
    "( i ) first , we plot a quantity in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4.3 ] ) in the log - log scale , using a polynomial fit of a fixed order , and check the linear dependence .",
    "( iia ) if the contributions of irrelevant fields are already suppressed for the smallest size considered , @xmath88 , a simple linear fit giving the lowest chi - square in the log - log plot yields an estimate .",
    "( iib ) otherwise , finite - size corrections are employed to achieve an asymptotic value of the slope , after marcq _ et al .",
    "_ and subsequent works @xcite .",
    "an expansion is made similar to that used for @xmath57 above , e.g. @xmath89 , followed by searching for the best @xmath68 and @xmath0 ( or other exponents ) , in the sense of lowest chi - square .",
    "this method , however , does not work sometimes due to rapid convergence of correction terms , or statistical errors in the raw data . in that case , ( iic ) we use a linear fit in the log - log plot neglecting data points subject to the finite - size effect .",
    "care is taken to ensure that the observed scaling behavior does indeed correspond to the asymptotic regime , in all of the cases .",

    "note that the final range of errors is given as the union of each error region considered , i.e. as wide as possible .",
    "recalling the value of @xmath0 for the ising and non - ising class , @xmath54 and @xmath105 respectively , we can clearly conclude that the glauber pca with @xmath55 belongs to the ising class .",
    "values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are obtained in the same way , which are @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and again completely consistent with the ising values .",

    "( ii ) since no finite - size effects are observed in intersections of @xmath57 for the glauber pca with @xmath50 , values and errors of @xmath66 and @xmath61 are determined by means and standard deviations of the coordinates of the intersections .",

    "they are closer to the ising exponent and this tendency slightly increases with isotropy .",
    "there seem to be two possible interpretations for it .",
    "one is that the critical exponents of the majority - vote pcas depend continuously on system parameters , anisotropy in our demonstrations .",
    "this is , however , commonly understood as an exceptional case , at least in equilibrium .",
    "instead , it is rather natural to consider that what we see here is a part of an extremely slow convergence in finite - size scalings toward the ising asymptotic behavior , which is estimated to be reached for @xmath126 . the slight dependence on the degree of anisotropy is then related to the difference in relaxation constants , which may be attributed to coupling intensity between sites , and/or an additional length scale caused by some hidden coherent structures such as in @xcite , if they exist . in any case ,",
    "further studies are essential to give a conclusion on it . in addition , the estimate for the completely anisotropic majority - vote pca , or the toom pca , @xmath127 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) is again incompatible with the value from mg , @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies between our estimates and mg s are caused by a few differences in steps toward estimation .",
    "one is in the sampling method .",
    "we started from random initial conditions and sampled @xmath129 consecutive data after discarding first @xmath33 time steps , whereas mg chose ordered initial conditions , in which all spins are @xmath130 , and set @xmath131 as the price for repeating independent simulations not more than @xmath132 times . since @xmath133 and @xmath42 of mg are in many cases comparable with the correlation time @xmath47 , and comparable with or much shorter than the sign reversal time @xmath48 , we consider that the sampling in mg is statistically insufficient and the influence from the ordered initial conditions may remain .",
    "another origin of the discrepancies is a way to determine transition points @xmath66 .",
    "we estimated them solely from the crossings of the cumulant @xmath57 , with finite - size corrections if possible , while mg first made a guess from the crossings and then determined them by searching for @xmath66 which gives the ratios of exponents @xmath3 and @xmath4 identical to those of the ising class .",
    "this is , however , rather perilous since estimates of critical exponents are very sensitive to various errors , including statistical ones .",
    "moreover , in general , a small uncertainty in critical points @xmath66 leads to much larger errors in critical exponents .",
    "in fact , if we assume the value of @xmath66 in mg for the glauber pca with @xmath50 , namely @xmath134 , we reproduce their result @xmath135 . for the reasons above ,",
    "we believe our results are more reliable .    in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated the ising - like phase transitions in synchronous pcas , namely the glauber pcas and the majority - vote pcas , with different degrees of anisotropy .",
    "our calculations reveal that the glauber pcas belong to the ising class regardless of the degree of anisotropy , and the majority - vote pcas are also expected to do so , though the latter remains to be clearly shown .",
    "the results indicate that the ising critical behavior is robust with respect to anisotropy and synchronism for the pcas , which coincide with the theoretical prediction of grinstein _ et al .",
