    "consider the situation which arises in the analysis of high - dimensional data , epitomized by a microarray data , where @xmath0 pairs of null and alternative hypotheses , @xmath1 , are simultaneously tested ; see , for instance , @xcite for concrete examples of such situations .",
    "two commonly - used type i error rates for this multiple testing problem are the family - wise error rate ( fwer ) , which is the probability of at least one false discovery , where discovery means rejecting ( accepting ) a null ( an alternative ) hypothesis , and the false discovery rate ( fdr ) , which is the expectation of the ratio of the number of false discoveries over the number of discoveries .",
    "the usual testing paradigm employed in these situations is to decide on the collection of statistical tests for the @xmath0 pairs of hypotheses , e.g. , a @xmath2-test for each pair , obtain the @xmath3-value for each test , and then use the resulting @xmath0 @xmath3-values in the fwer - controlling sequential idk  procedure , provided an independence condition is satisfied , or the fdr - controlling procedure in @xcite . in this conventional approach , there appears to be no leeway in the choice of the multiple testing procedure the moment the individual test procedures have been chosen .",
    "however , we pose the following question . if we are given the @xmath0 test procedures for each of the @xmath0 pairs of hypotheses , could we obtain classes of multiple testing procedures whose elements either control the fwer or the fdr ? if the answer to this question is in the affirmative , then we may be able to find _ a _ multiple testing procedure within these classes which is optimal with respect to some chosen type ii error rate . and , we may then be able to choose the starting collection of test functions that will provide the best multiple testing procedure .",
    "this paper is in this spirit .",
    "we will demonstrate that , under certain conditions , when given a collection of test functions for the @xmath0 pairs of hypotheses , that we can generate classes of multiple testing procedures controlling the fwer or the fdr .",
    "the results have important implications in the search for optimal multiple testing procedures that control either of these type i error rates as we will see later .",
    "we shall investigate these issues in a general , but not surprisingly , more abstract framework .",
    "the main results in this paper were motivated by those in @xcite which did not deal with classes of multiple testing procedures , but instead focussed in developing improved fwer and fdr - controlling procedures from the neyman - pearson most powerful tests for each of the @xmath0 pairs of hypotheses .",
    "let @xmath4 be a statistical model , so @xmath5 is a measurable space and @xmath6 is a collection of probability measures on @xmath5 .",
    "though not needed in the abstract development , for concreteness we may adopt the usual interpretation that @xmath7 is the space of possible realizations of an observable random entity @xmath8 from an experiment or a study . in decision problems with action space @xmath9 , such as in hypothesis testing",
    ", a nonrandomized decision function is a @xmath10 . in the hypothesis testing",
    "setting , given @xmath11 , a decision @xmath12 corresponds to deciding in favor of a null hypothesis ( @xmath13 ) , whereas a decision of @xmath14 , a _ discovery _",
    ", corresponds to rejecting @xmath13 in favor of an alternative hypothesis ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "it suffices to restrict ourselves to nonrandomized decision functions since , through the use of an auxiliary randomizer which is usually a standard uniform variable @xmath16 that is independent of @xmath8 , we can always convert a randomized decision function @xmath17,\\sigma[0,1])$ ] into a nonrandomized decision function @xmath18,\\mathcal{f } \\otimes \\sigma[0,1 ] ) \\rightarrow ( \\mathfrak{a},\\sigma(\\mathfrak{a}))$ ] via @xmath19 with @xmath20 the indicator function .",
    "thus , in our general formulation , the sample space @xmath7 may actually represent a product space between a data space and @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "this framework is appropriate , for instance , when dealing with discrete data or when using nonparametric decision functions . for more discussions on this matter ,",
    "see @xcite .",

    "the forms of these two random variables were motivated and justified in sections 6 and 7 in @xcite for a specific multiple decision size function , but the justifications in that paper carry over to the more general setting considered here .",
    "the two main results of this paper are contained in theorem [ theo - fwer control ] and theorem [ theo - fdr control ] .",

    "the importance of the preceding results is that each multiple decision process @xmath74 may have an associated multiple decision size process @xmath112 such that the resulting multiple decision functions @xmath113 or @xmath111 possess some optimality property , for example , with respect to the missed discovery rate . to define this rate ,",
    "let @xmath114 the quantity @xmath115 has the interpretation of being the proportion of missed discoveries relative to the number of correct alternative hypotheses .",

    "this idea was implemented in a more restricted setting in @xcite when each of the pairs of hypotheses contained simple null and simple alternative hypotheses .",
    "we note that previous works usually focussed in developing _ a _ particular mdf and then verifying that it controls the fwer or the fdr , such as , for example , in @xcite ; more comprehensively , see @xcite .",
    "it is our hope that by providing a class of mdfs where each member strongly controls the fwer , given by @xmath118 or a class of mdfs where each member controls the fdr , given by @xmath119 then we will acquire the possibility of selecting from these classes mdfs possessing other desirable properties with respect to type ii error rates .",

    "in contrast to theorem [ theo - fwer control ] where we were able to have the weaker version of condition ( d4 ) given in ( [ weaker d4 ] ) , we could not do this for theorem [ theo - fdr control ] .",

    "it may be possible that under certain situations we do have this supermartingale property , but the weaker condition ( [ weaker d4 ] ) appears not sufficient for this property to hold in general .",
    "this section expresses the mdfs @xmath220 in ( [ fwer - controlling mdf ] ) and @xmath221 in ( [ fdr - control mdf ] ) in terms of the generalized @xmath3-value statistics defined in ( [ generalized p - value ] ) .",

    "thus , through the idk  sizes , we are able to obtain from our formulation two popular mdfs for fwer and fdr control as special cases of the mdfs @xmath220 and @xmath221 !",
    "finally , in this subsection , we indicate , without going into much detail , the potential utility of the classes of mdfs arising from theorems [ theo - fwer control ] and [ theo - fdr control ] in the context of obtaining mdfs with some optimality properties , especially in non - exchangeable multiple hypotheses testing settings , which are those where the power characteristics of the @xmath0 test functions are not identical .",
    "let us fix a multiple decision process @xmath246 and fix a probability measure @xmath247 .",
    "define the mappings @xmath248 \\rightarrow [ 0,1]$ ] for @xmath41 according to @xmath249,\\ \\alpha \\in [ 0,1].\\ ] ] when viewed as a function of @xmath250 , @xmath251 is the power function of @xmath45 when it is allocated a size of @xmath26 . of interest to us , though , is to view it as a function of @xmath26 for the fixed @xmath250 . in this case , @xmath252 is the receiver operating characteristic curve ( roc ) of the @xmath253th test function .",
    "assume that for each @xmath41 , the mapping @xmath254 is strictly increasing with @xmath255 and twice - differentiable .",
    "suppose it is desired to strongly control the overall fwer or fdr at some pre - specified level @xmath98 $ ] , but at the same time maximize the total ( or average ) power at @xmath256 .",
    "our idea , partly implemented in @xcite , is to first obtain the optimal multiple decision size function for _ weak _ fwer control associated with @xmath117 , denoted by @xmath257 .",
    "this is the multiple decision size function @xmath67 satisfying the condition @xmath258:\\",
    "\\prod_{m \\in \\mathcal{m } } [ 1 - a_m(\\alpha ) ] = 1 - \\alpha,\\ ] ] and such that the total power at @xmath256 , given by @xmath259 , is maximized . under regularity conditions on the roc functions , the optimal @xmath260 function could be obtained using lagrangian optimization , for instance , see theorem 4.3 in @xcite which is an implementation when the individual test functions coincide with the neyman - pearson most powerful tests .",
    "now , having determined the optimal multiple decision size function @xmath260 associated with @xmath117 , which is at this point optimal only in the sense of _ weak _ fwer control , we can then apply theorem [ theo - fwer control ] to obtain the mdf @xmath261 which will _ strongly _ control the fwer at @xmath107 ; or apply theorem [ theo - fdr control ] to obtain the mdf @xmath262 which will control the fdr at @xmath107 .    by virtue of the choice of the size process @xmath260 , which is tied - in to the multiple decision process @xmath117 and the target probability measure @xmath250",
    ", we expect that the mdfs @xmath261 and @xmath262 will perform better with respect to overall power at @xmath250 relative to , for example , the sequential idk  mdf or the bh mdf , which we saw from the preceding section are mdfs arising from the idk  multiple decision size function , a size function that may not be optimal for the chosen multiple decision size process @xmath117 .",
    "for instance , results of a modest simulation study in @xcite demonstrated the improvement over the bh procedure of the mdf @xmath263 in a specific setting .",
    "further improvements in power performances could be achieved by proper choice of the multiple decision process @xmath117 , such as , for example , choosing it to have components that are uniformly most powerful ( ump ) or uniformly most powerful unbiased ( umpu ) test functions .",
    "these issues , however , will be deferred for future work , but we expect that the classes of mdfs presented here will play a central role in dealing with these more complex multiple hypotheses testing problems .",
    "we close by pointing out that other approaches have also been proposed for obtaining mdfs possessing certain optimality properties .",
    "relevant papers pertaining to optimality are @xcite .",
    "procedures with a bayes or an empirical bayes flavor can be found in @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is also of interest to extend our results to settings where the components of @xmath264 are dependent as in @xcite ; see also the review article @xcite .",
    "another possible extension is to consider generalized fwer and fdr as in @xcite .",
    "however , we defer consideration of such extensions for future work .",
