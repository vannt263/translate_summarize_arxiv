    "this article reviews the status of rare kaon decays , with emphasis on the progress made since the 1993 review in this series  @xcite .",
    "several other excellent review articles are available focusing on rare kaon decays  @xcite , theoretical studies of rare kaon decays  @xcite , and non - rare kaon decays  @xcite . due to limited space",
    ", we can not cover many interesting topics , such as _ cp _ violation in decays@xmath0 and @xmath1 , or _ t / cpt _ violation in decays , or searches for _ t _  violation in the transverse polarization of the @xmath2 in and .",
    "kaons have a relatively long lifetime because they decay only through the weak interaction . as a result ,",
    "studies of their decays provide key insights into the behavior of the weak interaction under the three fundamental symmetry operators _ c _ , _ p _ , and _",
    "t_. the first of these , _ c _ or charge conjugation , is a unitary operator that replaces particles by anti - particles .",
    "thus , in one possible sign convention , @xmath3 and @xmath4 the parity operator , _ p _ , inverts spatial directions , replacing left by right and vice - versa .",
    "the kaons are pseudoscalar particles which are odd under the action of _ p_. under the combined operator _",
    ", then @xmath5 even and odd eigenstates of _ cp _ called @xmath6 and @xmath7 can then be formed from the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 if _ cp _ were an exact symmetry of the weak interaction , these combinations would be identified with the observed eigenstates of mass and lifetime , called @xmath10 and @xmath11 the famous discovery in 1964  @xcite of the decay @xmath12 implied that _",
    "symmetry is violated in weak decays , since the @xmath13 which decays mostly to _",
    "cp_-odd final states , can also decay to @xmath14 which is _ cp_-even .",
    "we have since learned that nearly all of the @xmath15 decay can be explained by so - called _ indirect _ _ cp _ violation , in which the mass and lifetime eigenstates @xmath16 and @xmath17 are mixtures of the _ cp _ eigenstates given by @xmath18 and the decay proceeds via @xmath19 . a question that has been open",
    "until recently is whether there is also _ direct _ _ cp _ violation , in which the _ cp_-odd eigenstate @xmath7 decays to _ cp_-even final states such as @xmath20 the traditional method of searching for this phenomenon , which is expected in the standard model , is to look for a small deviation from unity of the so - called double ratio @xmath21 the value of this ratio has been reported  @xcite to be significantly different from unity , establishing the existence of direct _ cp _ violation in weak interactions .",
    "the standard model predicts a variety of other direct-_cp_-violating effects in rare kaon decays ; measurements of these processes , which are addressed in this article , can provide additional tests of the standard model picture of _ cp _ violation .    the anti - unitary operator _ t",
    "_ reverses the arrow of time . in lorentz - invariant local field theories , like the standard model , the combined operator _",
    "cpt _ is an exact symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "thus the observed _ cp _ violation in kaon decays would imply the existence of _ t _ violation .",
    "however , it is also interesting to search for more direct evidence of _ t _ violation , and a number of kaon - decay experiments have also played a central role in this effort .",
    "the field of rare kaon decays has a long and rich history : the discovery of the kaon in 1949  @xcite , the postulation of `` strangeness ''  @xcite , the @xmath22@xmath23 puzzle  @xcite and the understanding of parity violation  @xcite , the understanding of quark mixing  @xcite , the discovery of _ cp _ violation  @xcite , the small rate for and flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) in general , and the development of the glashow , iliopoulos , maiani ( gim ) mechanism  @xcite and the prediction of the charm quark mass  @xcite . as the field has evolved , so has the definition of `` rare '' decays , from branching ratios of @xmath2410@xmath25 to the current levels of @xmath2410@xmath26 .",
    "this article will , in general , cover modes with branching ratios below @xmath27 , with one measured to be less than @xmath28 .",
    "the two areas of greatest interest have been the very sensitive searches for physics beyond the standard model through lepton flavor - violating ( lfv ) decays and the studies of the standard - model picture of the cabibbo , kobayashi , maskawa ( ckm ) mixing  @xcite and _ cp _ violation that have recently begun to bear fruit .",
    "a large number of results from experiments at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) ( e787 , e865 , e871 ) , fermi national accelerator laboratory ( fnal ) ( e799-ii : ktev ) , and the european laboratory for particle physics ( cern ) ( na48 ) have been reported at recent conferences @xcite .",
    "many of these results have not yet been published .",
    "the weak decay of quarks is described through the unitary ckm matrix .",
    "this matrix and the wolfenstein parameterization  @xcite are shown below : @xmath29   & 1 - \\frac{a^2\\lambda^4}{2 } \\end{array } \\right ) , \\label{eqn : ckm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the sin of the cabibbo angle , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are related to the wolfenstein parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the unitarity of this matrix can be expressed in terms of six unitarity conditions which can be represented graphically in the form of triangles , all of which have the same area .",
    "the area of these triangles is equal to one half of the jarlskog invariant , @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "this is the fundamental measure of _ cp _ violation in the standard model .",
    "one of the possible unitarity relations that is frequently cited in the literature is @xmath39 this equation can be represented graphically , as in figure  [ fig : tri_norm ] , where we have divided all sides by @xmath40 , which is a real quantity to @xmath41 .",
    "this particular representation provides a convenient display , with the apex of the triangle given by the two least well - known of the wolfenstein parameters , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the best information currently comes from several measurements of b meson decays , as well as the measured value of @xmath0 from kaon decays .",
    "all of the unitarity triangles should be tested ; it is desirable to overconstrain each of the unitarity relations and to measure @xmath38 in each of the triangles .",
    "the most powerful tests of our understanding of _ cp_-violation and quark mixing will come from comparison of the results from b meson and kaon decays with little theoretical ambiguity .",
    "the two premier tests are expected to be :    * comparison of the angle @xmath42 from the ratio b()/b ( ) and the _ cp_-violating asymmetry in the decay  @xcite .",
    "* comparison of the magnitude @xmath43 from and the ratio of the mixing frequencies of @xmath44 to @xmath45 mesons , expressed in terms of the mass difference ratio  @xcite .",
    "the current value of the fundamental level of _ cp _ violation in the sm , @xmath38 = @xmath46 , is known , primarily from measurements of b meson decays , with about 40% uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "measurement of @xmath38 in the kaon system is very clean theoretically ( uncertainty of @xmath242% ) and can be expected to be measured to @xmath248% within a decade .",
    "while measurement of @xmath38 in the b system is difficult and is plagued by theoretical uncertainties , it is likely that a 15% measurement is possible and if this could be pushed to the level expected from the kaon system , the comparison of these values will also be an important test of the sm .",
    "interest in rare kaon decays extends well beyond their potential to determine standard - model parameters .",
    "dozens of different medium - rare ( branching ratios in the range @xmath47 to @xmath48 ) kaon decays have been measured . with the ever - increasing sensitivity of experiments designed to search for the very - rare modes that probe standard - model parameters or search for new physics ,",
    "the statistics available for these medium - rare decays have increased to the point where both precision branching ratio measurements and form factor studies are possible .",
    "both the branching ratios and the form factors provide excellent tests of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite , which should work well at the relatively low momentum scales characteristic of kaon decays .",
    "the wide variety of different modes and form factors can be used to test chpt .",
    "measurements of a number of modes , such as and , are directly relevant to the determination of standard - model parameters because these modes can be backgrounds to more interesting decays , such as or .",
    "they can also provide information necessary to disentangle different amplitudes contributing to the signal mode , such as the @xmath49 intermediate state for or the @xmath50 intermediate state for .",
    "the study of these `` non - marquee '' decay modes is thus more than a beneficial by - product of experiments designed to search for the more significant decays .",
    "their properties are often of vital importance to the determination of backgrounds , the extraction of standard - model parameters , or tests of the reliability of theoretical tools like chpt .",
    "a major thread in the history of the study of rare kaon decays is the search for exotic phenomena , often referred to as `` beyond the standard model '' ( bsm ) .",
    "the quintessential example is the long search for the decay .",
    "this decay is absolutely forbidden in the standard model with massless neutrinos ; specifically , it is forbidden by the symmetry of conserved lepton flavor number , for which no fundamental reason is known .",
    "grand unified theories or other extensions to the standard model often contain heavy vector bosons that connect the standard - model lepton families  for example , coupling muons to electrons ( horizontal gauge bosons ) or quarks to leptons ( leptoquarks ) . both types of particles could mediate the otherwise forbidden decays , such as or .",
    "because these decays simply do not happen in the standard model and are relatively simple to detect , they provide exceptional sensitivity to bsm physics . with experiments now probing branching ratios at the level of @xmath51 , even a very heavy exotic boson ( on the order of 100  tev , for the usual electroweak coupling )",
    "would lead to a detectable signal .",
    "the unitarity triangle is most readily expressed for the kaon system as follows : @xmath52 with the three vectors @xmath53 converging to form a very elongated triangle in the complex plane .",
    "this is illustrated graphically in figure  [ fig : tri_k ] .",
    "the first vector , @xmath54 , is well known .",
    "the height will be measured by and the third vector , @xmath55 , will be measured by the decay .",
    "the theoretical ambiguities in interpreting all of these measurements are very small",
    ". it may be possible to extract additional constraints on the height of the triangle from decays and on @xmath56 from decays .",
    "the base of this triangle has the length @xmath57 , determined from the decay rate of and nuclear beta decay .",
    "if we assume unitarity then @xmath58 is determined completely from and @xmath59 to very good approximation . to even better accuracy",
    "it is expressed as @xmath60 the value of @xmath30 , the best - known of the wolfenstein parameters , is extracted  @xcite from the measurement of the rate  @xcite .",
    "the height of the triangle , @xmath61 can be derived from a measurement of the branching ratio .",
    "the area of the triangle , @xmath62 , is then given by two kaon decay measurements as @xmath63 the ultimate uncertainty on @xmath64 and @xmath62 will be limited , not by theoretical ambiguities , but by experimental uncertainties on b ( ) , to @xmath65 from the next round of experiments .",
    "this compares favorably to the b system , where three ( four without the unitarity assumption ) measurements are needed .",
    "table  [ tab : ckm ] lists current values  @xcite for the magnitudes of the ckm matrix elements and wolfenstein parameters .    0.1 in    .magnitudes of ckm matrix parameters .",
    "the current values for the matrix elements @xmath66 are listed , where @xmath67 loops over the @xmath68-type and @xmath69 represents the @xmath70-type quarks , as are the @xmath71 values as defined earlier in the text and the wolfenstein parameters ( @xmath30 , a , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .

    "these modes have attracted interest in the context of heavy neutrino searches  @xcite .",
    "existing ktev data could be used to search for some other exotic modes , such as @xmath73 and @xmath74 , in the near future .",
    "the unprecedented sensitivities of the rare kaon decay experiments in setting limits on lfv have constrained many extensions of the standard model .",
    "the observation of has opened the doors to measurements of the unitarity triangle completely within the kaon system .",
    "significant progress in the determination of the fundamental ckm parameters will come from the generation of experiments that is starting now .",
    "comparison with the b meson system will then overconstrain the unitarity triangle and test the standard - model explanation of _ cp _ violation .",
    "the primary focus for the future of rare kaon decays is on the measurement of the golden modes , and , at sensitivities sufficient for observation of 100 sm events .",
    "major initiatives in this regard are underway at bnl , fnal and kek . at the same time",
    "the study of a number of medium - rare and radiative modes will be pursued , both as a by - product of the measurements and current @xmath75 measurements and in a dedicated study at ihep .      the da@xmath76ne @xmath77 accelerator complex and kloe detector at frascati ( italy ) ( see section  [ sec : kloe ] ) were both commissioned in 1999 .",
    "it is expected that by the time the machine reaches the full luminosity of @xmath78 , kloe will be able to observe @xmath79 tagged kaons of all charges per year . in addition to the measurement of @xmath75 , kloe will provide a wealth of new measurements on many rare and medium - rare decays , particularly for the @xmath17 modes .    a new kaon decay experiment",
    "( see section  [ sec : ihep ] ) is planned at the u70 accelerator in ihep in serpukhov .",
    "cern has provided ihep with an rf separator to be used in a 12-gev/@xmath80 separated kaon beam .",
    "this experiment may have even greater sensitivity than kloe to medium - rare charged kaon decays .",
    "the na48 collaboration has planned a special run after the final @xmath75 running , with the @xmath16 beam turned off , dedicated to improving sensitivity to rare @xmath17 decays .",
    "na48 is also considering improved measurements of some charged kaon decays .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    the principal focus of the kaon community is the precise measurement of the decay modes .",
    "these measurements will provide critical , unambiguous determination of the standard - model _ cp _ violation parameters .",
    "comparison with measurements from the b meson system will then over - constrain these parameters and test the standard - model picture of _ cp _ violation .    these measurements are difficult , but several clear and convincing cases have been made for measuring up to @xmath81 events in both modes .",

    "the experiment will make use of the entire proton flux from the ags to increase its sensitivity per hour by a factor of 15 over the sensitivity e787 achieved in 1995 .",
    "e949 is currently under construction and will run in 2001 through 2003 .",
    "the e949 sensitivity should reach one order of magnitude below the expectation for the signal , and the experiment should observe 10 standard - model events .",

    "later , the target would be moved downstream ( the kami - near configuration ) in order to increase the solid angle and the resulting kaon intensity .",
    "kami hopes to collect about 20 events per year of running in the kami - far configuration , increasing to 100 events per year with kami - near .",
    "backgrounds due to lost photons are a major concern , particularly due to photons escaping down the beam hole , where there is a high neutron flux . if kami is approved , running in the kami - far configuration may begin around 20052006 , with kami - near following perhaps around 2008 .",
