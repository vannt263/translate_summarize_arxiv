    "reconstructing the top mass is critical to many of the physics goals of the lhc .",
    "the top - quark mass is interesting in its own right as a fundamental parameter of the standard model ( sm ) , and for its role in pinning down other aspects of the sm and its extensions .",
    "our ability to reconstruct @xmath3 also affects new physics search strategies , in which top can appear as a signal or background .",
    "reconstructing the top mass on an event by event basis is an important tool for distinguishing top production from other processes .",
    "estimates for future runs at the tevatron , extrapolated from early run 1 results , suggest that @xmath3 will be measured at the 4  gev level @xcite .",
    "recent improvements in tevatron results @xcite may lead to more optimistic conclusions . at the lhc ,",
    "given the enhanced statistics , experiments may hope for an accuracy of 2  gev @xcite .",
    "but the ability to do this will depend on how well systematic effects  especially those associated with gluon radiation  are understood and controlled .",
    "it is therefore crucial to properly simulate the relevant physics .    by virtue of its energy and luminosity",
    ", the lhc will be a top factory .",
    "the top cross section at the 14  tev lhc is more than 100 times larger than at the 2  tev tevatron .",
    "this increase in production rate has a price , however : an increase in gluon radiation . in a @xmath0 interaction , 7",
    "tev protons can easily radiate quarks and gluons with only a small penalty to be paid in the parton distributions . as a result ,",
    "at the lhc there will be a plethora of radiation associated with top pair production",
    ". this radiation may well be the limiting factor in our ability to reconstruct the top mass , both on an event by event basis , and from global shapes .",
    "for example , the sheer quantity of radiation could result in emissions associated with top production ( as opposed to decay ) being included in the @xmath4-quark jet cone , introducing spurious contributions to the top mass reconstruction .",
    "additional jets may also introduce difficulties in choosing the appropriate jets for reconstructing momenta in the lepton+jets channel .",
    "this paper is an investigation of the effects of gluon radiation in top events at the lhc . in the next section ,",
    "we compare @xmath5 and @xmath6 production at the lhc to that at the tevatron .",
    "we then present in section 3 a complete tree - level @xmath7 calculation of @xmath8 .",
    "we present distributions of the radiated jets , with the radiation decomposed into production- and decay - stage emission . in section 4",
    "we compare our matrix element results with those from the parton shower monte carlo herwig , and we comment on the precision to which herwig appears to have this physics implemented for gluon radiation in top - quark production and decay . in section 5",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "to understand the effects of gluon radiation in top events at the lhc , it is useful to compare top production there and at the tevatron .",
    "the most obvious difference is in the @xmath0 production cross section , which is on the order of 100 times higher at the lhc . more relevant for our purposes",
    "is a similarity between the two machines : the fact that for heavy quark production , the mass of the quark rather than the collider energy sets the scale for the quark s transverse momentum .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : pt ] , which shows the transverse momentum of top quarks produced at the tevatron ( solid line ) and lhc ( dashed line ) , normalized to the tevatron cross section . despite the factor of seven difference in collider energy , the transverse momentum of the top quarks at the two machines",
    "is remarkably similar .",
    "the only noticeable effect of the lhc s higher energy is a slight spread in the distribution at larger @xmath10 .",
    "( and although we do not show it here , top quarks are produced at the lhc with broader rapidity distributions . )",
    "similar results are seen for @xmath11 production .",
    "this similarity in top quark spectra at the two machines has several consequences .",
    "the most notable is the set of @xmath12 values at which the parton distributions of the proton are probed at the two machines . at the tevatron",
    ", the parton typically has a fraction @xmath13 of the proton s energy . at the lhc ,",
    "the typical value is only @xmath14 .",
    "this results in 90% of the top quarks produced at the tevatron coming from @xmath15 annihilation , whereas at the lhc about 90% of the top quarks come from the @xmath16 initial state .",
    "this means , among other things , that we expect more gluon radiation in top production at the lhc because of the gluons larger color charge .",
    "a second consequence of the similarity in top quark spectra is that gluon emission in top quark _ decay _ at the lhc should be similar to that at the tevatron . at the lhc , therefore , gluon radiation is dominated by production - stage emission .",
    "we will discuss the full gluon distributions below , but because of the production - stage dominance we can draw a few general conclusions about the importance of radiation in top events by considering @xmath11 production .",
    "associated with the lowest - order part of each process are evaluated at @xmath17 , the total subprocess center - of - mass energy .",
    "the additional factor of @xmath18 associated with emission of the extra jet is evaluated at the jet s transverse energy @xmath19 .",
    "thus each @xmath20 cross section contains an overall factor @xmath21 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : sigmas ] shows the ratio of cross sections for @xmath22 and @xmath0 production at the tevatron ( solid line ) and lhc ( dashed line ) as a function of the minimum transverse energy @xmath23 of the gluon .",
    "the great enhancement for production stage emission at the lhc can be attributed to two sources .",
    "first , as mentioned above , gluons carry a larger color charge than quarks .",
    "therefore the color in the @xmath16 initial state at the lhc enhances gluon emission by a factor of approximately @xmath24 over the @xmath15 initial state at the tevatron .",
    "second , the parton distributions at the tevatron fall very steeply in the relevant @xmath12 range , making it difficult to provide the additional energy required for a production stage emission . at the lhc",
    ", the additional energy can be obtained with less of a cost in the parton densities .",
    "these effects are illustrated in the table , where we compare the contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath11 production at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "cross sections are given in picobarns with cuts on the extra jet as indicated .",
    "if we compare the ratios @xmath25 for the @xmath26 and @xmath16 initial states , we see an enhancement for @xmath16 compared to @xmath15 , as we would expect due to the larger color factor in the @xmath16 initial state .",
    "this happens for both colliders",
    ". a closer look shows that the @xmath16 enhancement is larger at the lhc , where we have , for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . at the tevatron ,",
    "these ratios are , respectively , 0.1 and 0.07 .",
    "the larger increase in the @xmath16 cross section over @xmath15 at the lhc is due to the diffference in behavior of the parton distributions discussed above .

    "[ fig : sigmas ] provides an indication of the relative importance of gluon radiation at the tevatron and lhc , it it should not be taken too literally .",
    "for example , it should not be translated directly into an expected number of top events containing an extra gluon .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "first , only production - stage radiation is explicitly included .",
    "second , and more important , it represents a fixed - order matrix element calculation which includes neither virtual effects nor effects due to multiple gluon emission , both of which can be important for low gluon energies .",
    "in fact the figure serves as a guide to the regions where we can and can not trust the matrix - element results . roughly speaking",
    ", they are reliable when the @xmath9 cross section is well below @xmath33 .",
    "this is satisfied at the tevatron for all @xmath23 cuts shown . at the lhc ,",
    "however , the first - order cross section rises dramatically with decreasing @xmath23 cut , and the @xmath9 cross section with gluon transverse energies greater than 10 gev _ exceeds _ the lowest - order cross section by a factor of 2 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmas ] and the table . clearly virtual and multi - gluon effects must be important there .",
    "we therefore restrict our lhc analysis to gluons with transverse momentum greater than 40 gev in what follows .",
    "it is useful to distinguish between two different types of radiation in @xmath34 processes , as we have implicitly done above and as has been discussed in previous work @xcite .",
    "gluons can be radiated in either the top production or decay stages .",
    "production - stage emission occurs before the top quark goes on shell and decay - stage emission occurs only after the top quark goes on shell . in principle , an event with an extra jet can be classified as ` production ' or ` decay ' by looking at the invariant mass of the decay products . in production emission events ,",
    "the @xmath35 and @xmath4 momenta will combine to give the top momenta . in decay emission events",
    ", the gluon momentum must also be included to reconstruct the top momenta .",
    "this interpretation is exact at the parton level in the narrow width approximation .",
    "finite top width effects can blur this interpretation due to interferences between production - and decay - stage emissions .",
    "however , the classification is still useful in our case because the top width of 1.5  gev is small compared to the 40  gev gluon @xmath23 cut imposed in the matrix element calculations .",
    "it should be kept in mind that this applies at the level of theory . in an experiment ,",
    "the production - decay distinction is further blurred by jet energy resolution and ambiguities associated with combinatorics and the like .",
    "we have performed a complete tree - level @xmath36 calculation of @xmath8 at 14 tev collision energy .",
    "the calculation was performed as in @xcite , with the exception of the choice of @xmath18 scale as discussed above .",
    "we include all contributing diagrams @xmath37 and @xmath38 . ] and their interferences ( with helicity amplitudes generated by madgraph @xcite ) , and all top width and @xmath4 mass effects .",
    "note that we do _ not _ include radiation off the @xmath35 decay products .",
    "we use mrs(a@xmath39 ) parton distributions @xcite .",
    "the kinematic cuts imposed on the final - state partons are ( the subscript @xmath40 refers to the extra jet only ) : and @xmath41 quarks . ]",
    "@xmath42    the resulting distributions for the extra jet at the lhc are shown in figures [ fig : et][fig : dr ] . in each figure",
    "the distribution is decomposed into contributions from production- ( dashed line ) and decay - stage ( solid line ) radiation according to final - state kinematics as described in @xcite .",
    "the most obvious feature of these distributions is the dominance of production over decay emission , due to the enhancements in production emission discussed above . the decay contribution does not receive this enhancement because its behavior is determined not by the collider energy , but by the phase space of a 175  gev top - quark decay .",
    "in addition to the relative size , the kinematics of the two types of emission are also interesting .",
    "figure [ fig : et ] shows the jet @xmath23 distribution .",
    "both contributions fall off with increasing @xmath23 , but production emission extends to much higher values .",
    "the smaller values of @xmath23 to which decay emission is constrained are again the consequence of the top decay kinematics . recall that even at the lhc , top quarks are produced with relatively modest transverse momentum ( cf .",
    "[ fig : pt ] ) , so that gluons from the decay do not receive much of a boost in @xmath43 .",
    "note also that an increase in the @xmath23 cut on the jet would result in a further reduction in relative size of the decay contribution compared to production .",
    "figure [ fig : eta ] shows the distribution in pseudorapidity of the extra jet .",
    "production emission is relatively flat in rapidity , as compared to the more central decay emission .",
    "this is consistent with our basic intuition that decay - stage radiation , being associated with the final - state particles  which tend to appear in the central rapidity region  is also likely to be produced centrally . but",
    "this decay contribution is small ; the important point to note here is that even in the central region , it is production - stage radiation that dominates .    the tendency of decay - stage radiation to be associated with the final - state @xmath4 quarks might lead one to expect that if the extra jet is ` near ' the @xmath4 jet it should be included in the mass reconstruction , and if it is not it should be excluded .",
    "figure [ fig : dr ] , which shows the distribution in @xmath44 between the jet and the nearest @xmath4 quark , confirms that the decay - stage radiation peaks close to the @xmath4 and production - stage radiation peaks further away .",
    "unfortunately , the production contribution is so large that it dominates even at the low @xmath44 cutoff .",
    "a higher @xmath23 cut on the jet would make this situation even worse .",
    "the best choice of what is ` near ' the @xmath4 quark will therefore balance the competing effects of decay emission falling outside the cone , and production emission falling inside the cone .",
    "it is tempting at this point to provide a prescription for dealing with the extra jets expected in top events at the lhc , for example by specifying how to make the best choice of what is ` near ' the @xmath4 quark . but",
    "optimizing this choice at the parton level would be naive , because effects of multiple emissions , hadronization , and detector resolution will all affect the results .",
    "we also note that radiation from @xmath35 decay products has not been included in our analysis here .",
    "since the best top mass reconstruction is obtained in the lepton+jets mode , radiation from hadronic @xmath35 decays must ultimately be included .",
    "this calculation has been done in the soft gluon approximation @xcite , and the contribution from a single hadronically decaying @xmath35 is found to be substantial  comparable in size and shape to the _ total _ decay contributions from radiation off the @xmath45 and @xmath46 antennae .",
    "the exact calculation including hadronic @xmath35 decays is currently in progress @xcite .    in practice",
    "the effects of gluon radiation are incorporated into the predictions that are used in experimental fits .",
    "the parton level calculation can and should be used to ensure that the radiation physics is properly implemented in event generators used in the experimental analysis .",
    "because the experimental analysis must rely on the predictions of monte carlo programs  for example , in fits to three - jet invariant mass distributions for top mass determination  it is important that these programs contain the correct physics .",
    "the monte carlo program herwig @xcite , which is widely used in experimental analyses , treats gluon radiation in top production and decay using parton showers .    in previous work @xcite",
    ", we compared our results for radiation at the tevatron with predictions of version 5.8 of herwig .",
    "we found significant discrepancies in regions where the two should agree .",
    "herwig appeared to have a deficit in decay - stage radiation compared to production @xcite .",
    "further investigation revealed differences even for @xmath9 production at @xmath47 colliders @xcite .",
    "recently herwig 5.8 was found to contain a bug @xcite which resulted in suppression of decay - stage radiation in top events .",
    "here we continue our comparison of matrix - element and parton - shower results using herwig 5.9 @xcite , in which the bug has been corrected .",
    "although we see some improvement in the agreement , major differences still exist .",
    "we begin by reproducing the lhc jet distributions using herwig 5.9 .",
    "the details of comparing a full parton shower monte carlo with a fixed - order matrix element calculation were discussed in previous papers @xcite .",
    "the idea is to combine particles from the parton shower into jets , and compare distributions of these jets to those from the matrix element calculation . for hadron colliders",
    "we use a cone algorithm to combine partons into jets .",
    "we identify events with production- and decay - stage emission according to the final state kinematics , as described above .",
    "results for the jet pseudorapidity are shown in figure [ fig : etahw ] .",
    "there is general agreement between the matrix element calculation and the parton shower .",
    "however , a closer examination reveals two important differences .",
    "looking at production emission , we see that the herwig distribution is peaked at large @xmath48 and has a dip in the center . in contrast , the matrix element distribution is relatively flat , as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] .",
    "since the jets in this case have relatively strong cuts , the perturbation series should be converging quickly and the tree - level matrix element distributions should be accurate .",
    "this suggests that the approximations used in herwig may be responsible for this discrepancy .",
    "the second difference between the matrix - element and parton - shower results is , as before , in the relative amounts of production and decay emissions . whereas herwig 5.8 with the bug had too _ little _ decay - stage radiation",
    ", the corrected version now seems to have too _ much _ compared to the matrix element calculation .",
    "this effect is illustrated more clearly in a simpler example .",
    "as in our previous work @xcite , we simplify the comparison by looking at @xmath47 machines near @xmath0 threshold . while the parton calculation is an inclusive calculation with a fixed number of final state particles , herwig is an exclusive calculation with an arbitrary number of final particles . to perform a meaningful comparison we employ the durham ( @xmath49 ) successive recombination algorithm to reconstruct jets from the herwig output @xcite .",
    "in addition , we impose cuts ( @xmath50  gev , @xmath51 ) on the jets to ensure the matrix element is being evaluated in a region where the perturbation series converges rapidly .",
    "the validity of this comparison was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the results of our comparison for @xmath52 are shown in figure [ fig : eehw ] , where along with the matrix - element calculation we show results from both the old ( 5.8 ) and corrected ( 5.9 ) versions of herwig .",
    "the center - of - mass energy of 360 gev is chosen just above @xmath0 threshold to suppress production - stage emission , so that almost all of the radiation occurs in the decays .",
    "[ fig : eehw](a ) shows the distribution in @xmath44 between the closest two jets , and fig .",
    "[ fig : eehw](b ) shows the minimum @xmath53 ( defined in the durham algorithm as @xmath54 ) for all jet pairings in the event .",
    "we see in both cases that the old version of herwig underestimates the amount of decay radiation and the new version overestimates it .",
    "the discrepancy even in the corrected version of herwig is dramatic .    as a technical aside",
    ", we note that the normalization of the matrix element for the @xmath47 case is fixed as in our previous work @xcite by choosing the value of @xmath55 that gives agreement between the matrix - element and parton - shower calculations for the case of @xmath56 production . the larger energy scale for",
    "top quark production might suggest the use of a smaller value of @xmath18 , which would make the discrepancy even larger .",
    "the disagreement between the matrix element calculation and herwig seems severe .",
    "a detailed study of the discrepancy is in progress and will appear elsewhere @xcite . for the moment",
    ", it appears that an estimate of the magnitude of the effect is the best that can be hoped for .",
    "we would expect this effect to contribute on the order of a few gev to the uncertainty in the measured top mass . while not catastrophic , clearly such a discrepancy is unacceptably large , given the precision hoped for in future experiments .",
    "further work must be done to provide an accurate event generator for top - quark production .",
    "top - quark production will be central to many physics studies at the lhc , and top mass reconstruction will be the key for identifying top events .",
    "the large energy of the lhc collider provides a large top - quark cross section , but it also provides for large amounts of gluon radiation in the top production process .",
    "we have calculated the cross section for top production and decay in association with an extra jet to order @xmath7 , and find a large probability for gluon radiation at the lhc compared to the tevatron . at the lhc",
    ", production - stage radiation dominates over decay - stage emissions ; this is also in contrast to the tevatron , where the two contributions are roughly comparable . as shown above , the relative amounts of production- and decay - stage radiation depend sensitively on the kinematic cuts applied .",
    "in addition , the decay contribution is expected roughly to double if radiation from hadronic @xmath35 decays is included .",
    "all of this has important implications for top physics at the lhc .",
    "even more so than at the tevatron , gluon radiation at the lhc must be understood not only because there is more of it , but because uncertainties in quantities like the top mass will be dominated by systematic effects due to gluon radiation .",
    "for example , the proliferation of production - stage gluon radiation means that it will sometimes be included in the top mass reconstruction , and therefore will limit our ability to reconstruct the top mass .",
    "quantifying the magnitude of this and similar effects requires simulations which implement all of the relevant physics correctly .",
    "unfortunately our comparisons show that even the most recent version of herwig , corrected for the bug in version 5.8 , still does not reproduce the correct distributions .",
    "apparently a hard gluon correction is needed to model radiation in the production and decay of very heavy quarks .",
    "it should be a priority to provide a top - quark event generator with the standard model physics implemented as accurately as possible .",
