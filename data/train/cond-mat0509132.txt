    "this is still small compared to typical values @xmath102 , determined by the guide properties ( @xmath103 ) and no significant beam widening should occur .",

    "one more point for the sake of a skeptical reader remains to be clarified .",
    "as it is well known in the classical space optics , it is impossible to obtain a geometrically similar image even for an infinitely small object ( except of the trivial case of identical infinite plane mirror imaging ) .",
    "the fact is a trivial consequence of that the longitudinal magnification is never equal to the transverse one .",
    "however since our aim is not to have an ideal image of an initial @xmath19 @xmath106 event but to compress a neutron beam to enhance the intensity for the tof devices in a certain velocity - time interval , this kind of aberrations , which is a nuisance for space optics , for our aims on the contrary provides valued effects improving tof time resolution .",
    "there is another cause of aberrations in the standard space optics .",
    "it is related to paraxial or gaussian approximations which are based on an expansion of phase factors over off - axis distances@xcite .",
    "formally we have found the exact space - time trajectory eq .",
    "( [ zt ] ) , eq . ( [ a4 ] ) , or by other words all aberrations are included ( the validity window for the geometrical optics approach is extremely wide since thermal neutron wavelengths are of the order of @xmath107 much smaller than typical sample sizes ) .",
    "thus , in principle , in the frame work of the found above special solution of the newton equations , an arbitrary good resolution can be achieved ( except that evident physical and technical constraints we discuss in the next section ) . for a more general case ( when the condition of constant acceleration for each neutron is not granted )",
    ", the analytical treatment requires a set of different approximate methods on certain scales of length and time , and one has to consider the aberration problems .",
    "for efficient use in a tof spectrometer , the magnetic lens should be located between the first chopper and the sample ( see fig.[fig.1 ] ) .",
    "the lens region should be as long as possible to keep the maximum field strength @xmath93  for a given velocity band @xmath108 as low as possible . in tof spectrometers ,",
    "in general the distance @xmath109 from the first chopper to the sample is somewhat larger than the distance @xmath110 from the sample to the plane of detection , which helps for choosing a time magnification @xmath52 close to 1 ( see eq.([ma ] ) ) with its optimal imaging properties concerning time resolution at the detector .    as design parameters we choose @xmath111 , @xmath112 and a total length of @xmath113 for the traveling field , starting @xmath114 behind the first chopper and terminating 1 m before the sample position .",
    "as central neutron velocity we take @xmath115which is a convenient velocity for high resolution tof instruments . from these parameters",

    "this still matches to the time resolution of commonly used gas detector tubes , however the use of scintillator based detectors ( at least 10 times higher resolution ) seems preferable in this case .",
    "( [ bd ] ) links the maximal velocity band @xmath48,which can be focused by the time lens , to the maximum traveling @xmath125field , which can be applied . due to the rather low duty cycle of less than 10% of the field , a maximum field strength of @xmath126",
    "can be assumed in the following , certainly within reach using state of the art accelerator technologies . from eq .",

    "this favors slow neutrons , as the relative bandwidth increases with wavelength .",
    "a second chopper should be placed at a position @xmath131 it takes the role of the time aperture for the optics , limiting the velocity band to the nominal width @xmath132 actually it is more convenient to place this chopper after the wanderfeld area with slightly reduced opening time .    for @xmath133 ,",

    "furthermore the envisaged time resolution of @xmath151  at the detector seems not reachable for conventional tof spectrometers , as a value of @xmath143 for the opening time of the second chopper can not be reached with state of the art technology for a neutron beam of reasonable width .",
