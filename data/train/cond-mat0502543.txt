    "randomness induced quantum phase transitions have attracted intensive interests in the past decades .",
    "putting enough strong bond randomness , analyses of real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) method have shown that rg flows of spin s=1 and s=1/2 quantum antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains @xcite go to a stable fixed point called the random singlet ( rs ) phase in which spins far apart in space randomly form weakly bound singlet pairs .",
    "this property induces universal behaviors of ground states and low temperature thermodynamics , e.g. the energy spectrum is gapless , the temporal correlation length @xmath4 and spatial correlation length @xmath5 diverge at zero temperature , and there is a non - universal infinite dynamical exponent @xmath6 which comes from the relation @xmath7 .",
    "more important , the uniform susceptibility diverges universally in the rs phase as @xmath8 at low temperature , where @xmath9 is a non - universal constant . on the other hand ,",
    "the s=1/2 dimerized afm chain was found to be extremely stable against strong bond randomness@xcite . in this case , the system is in a quantum griffiths - mccoy ( qg ) phase when the bond randomness is strong enough .",
    "this phase is characterized by gapless excitations and finite correlation length . in the qg phase",
    ", the uniform susceptibility behaves as @xmath10 at low temperature , where @xmath11 is a non - universal exponent . on the experiments ,",
    "the bond randomness effects have been found in several antiferromagnetic quasi-1d materials @xcite . especially , a recent experiment on bacu@xmath1(si@xmath12ge@xmath12)@xmath1o@xmath13 @xcite clearly show typical scaling relations of rs phase predicted by theory@xcite .",
    "moreover , there is another kind of bond randomness whose bonds can be both afm and fm . in such systems , the rsrg analyses @xcite predicted a universal fixed point different from the rs phase because the spins correlate to form effective spins whose average size grows with lowering of the energy scale , and the magnetic susceptibility is _ curie - like _ @xmath14 .",
    "materials with such randomness is also fabricated @xcite .    besides the above mentioned two kinds of bond randomness , manaka and coworkers recently found that the compound ( ch@xmath0)@xmath1chnh@xmath0cu(cl@xmath2br@xmath3)@xmath0 @xcite can be considered as a bond randomness s=1/2 afm and fm alternating heisenberg chains .",
    "the isomorphous compounds ( ch@xmath0)@xmath1chnh@xmath0cucl@xmath0 @xcite is regarded as quasi-1d s=1/2 fm - afm alternating material , and ( ch@xmath0)@xmath1chnh@xmath0cubr@xmath0 @xcite is a s=1/2 afm dimerized material . mixing these two compounds , they observed that a gapless phase appeared in the regime of the intermediate concentration @xmath15 of fm bonds by measuring magnetic susceptibility and specific heats . in order to describe the properties of this material ,",
    "hida @xcite and nakamura @xcite suggested a 1d model @xmath16 where @xmath17 presents a spin s=1/2 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 with a probability @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "this model has two limits : ( i ) when @xmath23 , it is a s=1/2 afm - fm alternating heisenberg spin chain . when @xmath24 its ground state is the haldane phase with gapped energy spectrum ; ( ii ) when @xmath25 , it is a dimerized afm heisenberg spin chain , its ground state is the singlet dimer phase with gapped spectrum . by density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )",
    "method , hida @xcite considered the case @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 or @xmath29 , and confirmed that there exists qg singularity when @xmath30 .",
    "nakamura @xcite studied the model by non - equilibrium relaxation analysis of the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation in the whole parameter space of concentration @xmath31 with @xmath27 and @xmath32 , and found the gap vanishes in the regime @xmath33 consistent with the experimental results @xcite .",
    "however , in all these numerical works , the finite temperature magnetic properties in the whole parameter space of @xmath34 are absent . in order to directly compared with the experimental results @xcite , we perform the finite temperature qmc simulations extensively on this model in this paper .",
    "we investigate the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the model defined by eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath27 and @xmath35 using qmc simulations of continuous imaginary time loop / cluster algorithm .",
    "the weak afm coupling @xmath27 is fixed on all odd position bonds .",
    "for even position bonds , the strong afm or fm bonds @xmath36 are chosen randomly according to the probability @xmath37 .",
    "we perform simulations for @xmath38 bond arrangement configurations . for each bond configuration , after @xmath39 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) for thermalization , we further update @xmath39 mcs for monte carlo average .",
    "the temporal and spatial periodic boundary conditions are chosen for all simulations . in order to convince us of the code validity , we study s=1/2 dimerized afm chain in weak dimerization , and find our results for the energy gap consist well with recent dmrg results @xcite .",
    "we first investigate the ground state properties on the system size @xmath40 for temperatures as low as @xmath41 . at low temperature ,",
    "the energy gap @xmath42 is estimated by @xmath43 where @xmath4 is the imaginary time correlation length obtained by second - moment method @xcite .",

    "the results obtained are shown in fig .",
    "[ zd_eps ]    it is interesting to find that energy gap @xmath42 exists for the haldane phase at @xmath23 point .",
    "it gradually approaches to zero at @xmath45 , and it opens again at very small @xmath46 .",
    "it s hard to locate accurately the vanishing point of @xmath42 because our @xmath42 results are not exact zero value due to finite - size effects .",
    "but our calculations show that the gap should close at @xmath47 and @xmath48 . as a result",
    ", we presume that the system stays in the gapless phase in the regime of @xmath49 , which is consistent with the previous results @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ zd_eps ] , we also observe that @xmath50 at the limit @xmath23 , keeps at finite in the regime @xmath51 , changes its sign at @xmath52 , and then turns down to @xmath53 when @xmath54 .",
    "the values of @xmath55 characterize the two limits of different ordered phases presented in fig .",
    "[ limitsfig ] .",
    "recent qmc study @xcite on s=1 random bond - alternating haldane chain has shown that the vbs order parameter @xmath56 is not effected by qg singularity , and it is an effective parameter to locate the rs critical point . combining the results of @xmath56 and @xmath42",
    ", we find that in the regime of @xmath57 where @xmath42 vanishes and @xmath56 approaches zero from finite values , the system belongs to a critical phase . at the point @xmath52 ,",
    "as @xmath56 changes its sign , a phase transition happens . in the regime of @xmath58",
    ", @xmath42 vanishes and @xmath59 increases from zero to finite values .",
    "this fact reveals the system enters to other critical phase . in the regime of @xmath60 , where both @xmath42 and @xmath56 are finite , the system keeps in an ordered phase .    in order to distinguish the upper mentioned different phases",

    "the results are summarized as following .    _",
    "i. _ as shown in fig .",
    "[ xu04_eps ] ,    [ xu04_eps ]    in the regime @xmath63 , the system keeps in gapless phase , where @xmath61 diverges when @xmath64 , and every @xmath61 curve appears a valley , that is the typical feature of eq .",
    "( [ eq_rsxu ] ) for denoting rs phase .",
    "we fit the curves of @xmath65 and @xmath66 by eq .",
    "( [ eq_rsxu ] ) , and find they can be very well fitted as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fitrs_eps ] .",
    "thus we believe that the phase in this regime belongs to rs phase .    _",
    "the regime of @xmath58 is also a gapless regime , where @xmath61 curves diverge too , but they are obviously different from those in the regime of @xmath63 . instead , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ xu0407_eps ] , these curves are very similar as those in the qg phase , where the typical feature is described by eq .",
    "( [ eq_qgxu ] ) .    in fig.[fitqg_eps ]",
    ", we fit our low temperature results of @xmath61 by @xmath67 , and find again the fitness are quite good .",
    "it is interesting to note that the behavior of @xmath61 is not _ curie - like _ , so one can believe the phase is not belong to the universal class of afm and fm bonds randomness @xcite .",
    "we thus conjecture that the system is now in qg phase .",
    "_ for the regime of @xmath60 , the system enters to a gapped phase because all @xmath61 curves appear the tendencies going to zero when @xmath64 .",
    "our results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ xu0710_eps ] .    _",
    "at last , we consider the two limit cases @xmath25 and @xmath23 , and our results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ xulimit_eps ] . obviously , the system belong to the gapped haldane phase and dimerized amf phase on these two points , respectively .",
    "from our qmc calculations , we can conclude that this s=1/2 afm - fm alternating bond randomness chain has four different phases with respect to the probability @xmath37 : ( _ i _ ) @xmath25 , the system is a dimerized afm chains with gapped energy spectrum ; ( _ ii _ ) in the regime of @xmath63 , the system enters to the rs phase , whose energy spectrum is gapless and the uniform magnetic susceptibility @xmath61 obeys the eq .",
    "( [ eq_rsxu ] ) ; ( _ iii _ ) in the regime of @xmath58 , the system turns to the qg phase where the energy gap vanishes and the curves of @xmath61 consist with eq .",
    "( [ eq_qgxu ] ) ; ( _ iv _ ) in the regime of @xmath68 , the system is again in a gapped phase .",
    "finally , the case @xmath23 corresponds to the gapped afm - fm alternating spin chain .",
    "consequently , there should be three phase boundaries between these different phases : ( _ i_)@xmath69(_ii _ ) , because there is no effective quantities to locate the exact position of this boundary , we only say that the transition from the dimerized phase to the rs phase happens at very small @xmath46 ; ( _ ii_)@xmath69 ( _ iii _ ) , the phase boundary between rs phase and the qg phase resides at @xmath70 , where both the results of vbs order parameter @xmath56 and susceptibility @xmath61 consist reciprocally . @xmath56",
    "changing its sign at the point @xmath70 also implies that it is a good quantity to indicate the transition from rs phase to other phase , which confirm the previous argument @xcite ; ( _ iii_)@xmath69(_iv _ ) , the location of the boundary between qg phase and the gapped phase at @xmath71 is hard to be determined by results of energy gap @xmath42 because of the finite - size - effects , but it can be extracted from the behaviors of @xmath61 at different temperature . in the qg phase",
    ", @xmath61 diverges as @xmath64 , but in a gapped phase , @xmath61 approach zero when @xmath64 .",
    "thus there should be a cross point of @xmath61 at different temperature which correspond to the boundary .",
    "we investigate the case of same system size @xmath40 at different temperature @xmath72 , and analyze the results by finite - size - scaling of imaginary time @xcite .",
    "our results , plotted in fig .",
    "[ scalex_eps ] , have shown that the gap should close at @xmath73 , this result consist with previous dmrg results @xcite .",
    "this model can be described under the scenario for the study of s=1 af bond random chain by r. hyman and k. yang @xcite , and our result give a positive evidence to support their conclusion .",
    "more important , our qmc results of @xmath61 are consistent with the experiment results @xcite of quasi-1d ( ch@xmath0)@xmath1chnh@xmath0cu(cl@xmath2br@xmath3)@xmath0 in the two limits @xmath74 , as found in fig.[xulimit_eps ] . in the gapless regime , @xmath75 , where @xmath61 diverge when @xmath76 , the behavior are similar with the experiments observation that @xmath77 diverges also for @xmath78 at low temperature .",
    "especially , we find the critical point @xmath79 corresponding to @xmath80 is very close to the experimental @xmath81 .",
    "as the critical point @xmath47 corresponding to @xmath82 is different from the experimental @xmath83 , it implies the current single chain model eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) is failed to describe the results of experiment for small @xmath37 , and some additional terms such as the weak inter - chain coupling should be taken into account .",
    "furthermore , we believe that the behavior of @xmath77 in the regime @xmath84 for the experiment should successively exhibit first the qg - type divergence @xmath67 , then the rs - type divergence @xmath85 at low temperatures .",
