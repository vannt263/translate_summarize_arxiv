    "we consider a broad class of queueing models with random state - dependent vacation periods .",
    "in contrast to conventional vacation models ( see for instance  @xcite for a comprehensive overview ) , the server may take a vacation after each service completion and return from a vacation with certain probabilities that depend on the queue length . specifically , when there are @xmath0  customers left behind in the system after a service completion , the server either takes a vacation with probability @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , or starts the service of the next customer otherwise .",
    "likewise , the server returns from a vacation and starts the service of the next customer at the first event of a non - homogeneous poisson process of rate @xmath3 , with @xmath4 , when there are @xmath0  customers in the system .    in view of the vacation discipline",
    ", we analyze the queue length process at departure epochs , unlike most papers on vacation models which consider the queue length process embedded at instants when vacations begin or end .",
    "a notable exception is @xcite , which studies an m / g/1 queue with a similar state - dependent vacation discipline , and establishes a stochastic decomposition property under certain assumptions .",
    "we show that this decomposition property in fact holds in far greater generality and corresponds to the fuhrmann - cooper decomposition .",
    "in addition , we obtain the exact stationary distributions of the queue length and delay for m / g/1 queues in three scenarios : ( i ) the probability @xmath5 decays geometrically as a function of the queue length , and the vacation is independent of the queue length ; ( ii ) the probability @xmath5 is inversely proportional to the queue length , and the vacation is independent of the queue length ; ( iii ) @xmath6 and the activation rate @xmath7 is proportional to the queue length .",
    "we further derive lower and upper bounds for the mean queue length and mean delay in two cases : the activation rate @xmath7 is fixed and the vacation probability @xmath5 is a convex decreasing function ; the activation rate @xmath7 is a concave or convex increasing function and @xmath6 . various stochastic bounds and comparison results",
    "are established as well .",
    "we leverage the various bounds and stochastic comparison results to obtain the limiting distribution of the scaled queue length and delay in heavy - traffic conditions .",
    "the heavy - traffic asymptotics exhibit a sharp trichotomy .",
    "the first heavy - traffic regime emerges in scenarios  ( ii ) and  ( iii ) described above . in this regime",
    "the scaled queue length and delay converge to random variables with a gamma distribution .",
    "the commonality between these two scenarios lies in the fact that the ratio @xmath8 of the activation rate and the vacation probability is linear in the queue length . loosely speaking",
    ", this means that the amount of vacation time is inversely proportional to the queue length .",
    "this proportionality property also holds for polling systems and in particular vacation queues with so - called branching type service disciplines , where the number of customers served in between two vacations ( switch - over periods ) is proportional to the queue length at the start of the service period .",
    "interestingly , the scaled queue length and delay for these types of service disciplines have been proven to converge to random variables with a gamma distribution in heavy - traffic conditions as well .",
    "the significance of the ratio @xmath8 may also be recognized when the activation rate and vacation probability are in fact constant , i.e. , independent of the queue length . in that case , the server is active a fixed fraction of the time which only depends on the activation rate and vacation probability through their ratio .    in the second heavy - traffic regime , which emerges in scenario  ( i ) described above , the scaled queue length and delay both converge to an exponentially distributed random variable with the same mean as in the corresponding ordinary m / g/1 queue without any vacations . in other words , the impact of the vacations completely vanishes in heavy - traffic conditions . note that in this scenario the vacation probability falls off _ faster _ than the inverse of the queue length .",
    "the third heavy - traffic regime manifests itself when the vacation probability decays _ slower _ than the inverse of the queue length , e.g. , like the inverse of the queue length raised to a power less than one . in that case",
    ", the queue length and delay , scaled by their respective means , converge to one in distribution , while the mean values increase an order - of - magnitude faster with the traffic intensity than in the first two regimes .",
    "while the above results are of independent interest from a queueing perspective , they are also particularly relevant for the analysis of distributed medium access control algorithms in wireless networks , which in fact was the main motivation for the present work .",
    "emerging wireless networks typically lack any centralized control entity for regulating transmissions , and instead vitally rely on the individual nodes to operate autonomously and fairly share the medium in a distributed fashion . a particularly popular mechanism for distributed medium access control is provided by the csma ( carrier - sense multiple - access ) protocol . in the csma protocol",
    "each node attempts to access the medium after a certain back - off time , but nodes that sense activity of interfering nodes freeze their back - off timer until the medium is sensed idle . from a queueing perspective",
    ", the back - off times may be interpreted as vacation periods during which no transmissions take place , even when packets may be queued up .    despite their asynchronous and",
    "distributed nature , csma - like algorithms have been shown to offer the capability of achieving the full capacity region and thus match the optimal throughput performance of centralized scheduling algorithms operating in slotted time @xcite . based on this observation ,",
    "various clever algorithms have been developed for finding the back - off rates that yield specific target throughput values or that optimize concave throughput utility functions in scenarios with saturated buffers @xcite .    in the same spirit",
    ", several powerful algorithms have been devised for adapting the back - off probabilities based on the _ queue lengths _ in non - saturated scenarios @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the latter algorithms provide maximum - stability guarantees under the condition that the back - off probabilities of the various nodes are reciprocal to the logarithms of the queue lengths .",
    "unfortunately , however , such back - off probabilities can induce excessive queue lengths and delays , which has triggered a strong interest in developing approaches for improving the delay performance @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that more aggressive schemes , where the back - off probabilities decay faster to zero as function of the queue lengths , can reduce the delays .",
    "the heavy - traffic results described above offer a useful indication of the impact of the choice of the back - off probabilities on the delay performance .",
    "it is worth observing that the vacation model does not account for the effects of the network topology , and highly aggressive schemes which are optimal in a single - node scenario , may in fact fail to achieve maximum stability in certain types of topologies  @xcite .",
    "however , the single - node results provide fundamental insight how the role of the back - off probabilities may inherently inflate queue lengths and delays .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ modeld ]",
    "we present a detailed model description .",
    "we provide an exact analysis of the model in section  [ exactana ] , which yields formulas for the stationary queue length distribution in some specific cases . in section  [ secbounds ]",
    "we derive lower and upper bounds for the mean queue length and we establish a stochastic relation between systems with different functions @xmath9 and @xmath7 .",
    "we study heavy - traffic behavior in section  [ htresults ] and identify three qualitatively different regimes . in section  [ concl ]",
    "we summarize our findings and discuss the implications for wireless networks .",
    "finally , appendix  [ appendix ] contains some proofs that have been relegated from the main text .",
    "we consider an m / g/1 queue with vacations .",
    "that is , we consider a queueing system with one server that can be active or inactive .",
    "customers arrive according to a poisson process with rate  @xmath10 , independent of the state of the system .",
    "let @xmath11 indicate whether the server is active at time @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) or not @xmath14 ) and denote by @xmath15 the number of customers in the system at time  @xmath12 . when inactive , no customer is served and we say that the server is on vacation . the server becomes active after some time that may depend on the number of waiting customers at the beginning of the vacation period and the number of customers that arrive during the vacation period , but it may not depend on future arrivals .",

    "further we assume @xmath19 , i.e.  the server does not activate if no customers are present in the system .",
    "let the random variable @xmath20 denote the number of arrivals during a vacation period that begins with @xmath0 customers in the system .",
    "we will assume that @xmath21 is such that @xmath22 .",
    "when active , customers are served and the service times , generically denoted by  @xmath23 , are generally distributed with distribution function @xmath24 and laplace - stieltjes transform @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that @xmath26 and that the service times are independent of the arrival and vacation times . right after a service completion that leaves @xmath0 customers behind ,",
    "the server becomes inactive with probability @xmath27 , where @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "further we assume @xmath29 , i.e.  the server always becomes inactive if no customers are left in the system .",
    "let @xmath30 denote the traffic intensity of the system .",
    "throughout this paper , we denote the generating function of a non - negative and discrete random variable  @xmath31 by @xmath32 , with @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath34    let @xmath35 denote that two random variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 are equal in distribution , so that @xmath38 for all @xmath39 .",
    "further , let @xmath40 denote that @xmath36 is stochastically larger than @xmath37 , so that @xmath41 for all @xmath39 .",
    "finally , let @xmath42 denote that @xmath36 is stochastically strictly larger than @xmath37 , so that @xmath40 and , additionally , @xmath43 for some @xmath39 .",
    "denote by @xmath44 the number of customers just after the @xmath45-th service completion and by @xmath46 the number of arrivals during the @xmath45-th service .",
    "then @xmath47 constitutes a markov chain with transition probabilities @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 . because @xmath20 and @xmath46 are assumed to be independent , @xmath52 where @xmath53 for all @xmath45 . using this relation we can find a sufficient condition for stability of the system .",
    "[ stable ] the markov chain @xmath54 is positive recurrent if @xmath55    this result is proved in  @xcite , using the results in  @xcite . for a short proof note",
    "that from   we find @xmath56 .",
    "the result now follows immediately from pakes lemma  @xcite as @xmath57 for all @xmath58 by assumption .    in words , lemma  [ stable ] states that for stability it is sufficient that the system is busy serving customers more than a fraction @xmath59 of the time if the number of customers in the system is large .",
    "we henceforth assume the system is stable , i.e.  @xmath9 and @xmath21 are such that the condition in   is satisfied .",
    "let the random variable  @xmath60 have the stationary distribution of the embedded markov chain @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath61 by the pasta property and a level crossings argument we know that @xmath62 is also the stationary distribution of the number of customers in the system  @xmath63 , with @xmath64 for any @xmath65 .",
    "hence , using  , we obtain the relation @xmath66 which corresponds to  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 2 ) ) .",
    "equivalently , @xmath67    [ pkexmp ] one activation scheme would be to never de - activate when the system is nonempty right after a service completion , i.e. ,  @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "similarly we could say that the server always activates immediately if there are waiting customers at the beginning of the vacation period , i.e. ,  @xmath70 for @xmath69 , and @xmath71 otherwise , so that @xmath72 for @xmath69 . for this activation scheme",
    "simplifies to @xmath73 using that @xmath74 and applying lhpital s rule yields @xmath75 and hence @xmath76 note that if the server waits for exactly one customer to arrive if there are no waiting customers at the beginning of the vacation period , i.e.  @xmath77 , then   becomes the classical pollaczek - khinchin formula for the standard m / g/1 queue without vacations , @xmath78    the fuhrmann - cooper decomposition  @xcite relates @xmath79 to the pollaczek - khinchin formula through @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the number of customers in the system at an arbitrary epoch during a non - serving ( vacation ) period .",
    "this decomposition property can be derived from  .",
    "for this denote by @xmath82 and @xmath83 the number of customers in the system at , respectively , the beginning and the end of a vacation period , and let @xmath84 be the probability that the server becomes inactive after a departure , @xmath85 because the system is stable the expected number of arrivals between two service completions is equal to the expected number of service completions , which equals one .",
    "therefore , @xmath86 and the expected number of arrivals during a vacation period is therefore given by @xmath87 further note that @xmath88 from   we now find @xmath89 yielding  , see  @xcite . thus to find @xmath79 we can either solve equation   or find @xmath90 and then use the fuhrmann - cooper decomposition .",
    "in the remainder of this section we will analyze the system for several choices of @xmath21 and @xmath9 .",
    "in this subsection we assume that @xmath91 for @xmath69 , with @xmath92 some generic random variable .",
    "we further assume that @xmath93 , so that with nonzero probability at least one customer arrives during any vacation . the case @xmath94 is already solved in example  [ pkexmp ] .",
    "next , if a vacation starts with no customers in the system , we assume that first @xmath92 customers arrive . after this , if the system is still empty , the vacation is extended in an arbitrary way until at least one customer has arrived .",
    "we thus have @xmath95 if @xmath96 , i.e.  if @xmath97 , and @xmath98 otherwise , i.e.  if @xmath99 .",
    "to summarize , in this subsection we study the following scenario .",

    "so from   and @xmath29 it follows that @xmath107 equation   seems hard to solve in general , but we are able to find solutions for several specific choices for @xmath9 . before analyzing   in more detail",
    "we now first give a prototypical example of a system that belongs to scenario  [ scen1 ] .",
    "this example describes a back - off mechanism used in wireless networks .",
    "[ vactime ] consider a server that always waits for a certain time @xmath108 , independent of the arrivals during this time .",

    "although interesting , it is beyond the scope of this paper to analyze this in more detail .",

    "in this paper we have obtained results for queues with random back - offs .",

    "we have obtained exact expressions for the distribution of the number of customers in the system in section  [ exactana ] and bounds for the mean stationary number of customers in the system in section  [ secbounds ] .",
    "these results were employed to derive heavy - traffic limit theorems in section  [ htresults ] , which showed the existence of a clear trichotomy , that can be best explained through the function @xmath9 . clearly , in order for the system to be stable when @xmath459 , @xmath9 should eventually , as the number of customers increases , go to zero .",
    "this condition is also sufficient , see lemma  [ stable ] .",
    "roughly speaking ( for details and further assumptions see section  [ htresults ] ) , the queueing system with back - offs can display three modes of operation , depending on the asymptotic decay rate of @xmath9 .",
    "these three modes can be understood as follows :    \\(i ) the case @xmath125 represents the _ balanced regime _ , in which the heavy - traffic behavior is influenced by both the system behavior without back - offs , and the back - off periods .",
    "hence , large queue sizes typically build up according to sample paths that display exceptional ( interrupted ) busy periods and exceptional sequences of back - off periods .",
    "the number of customers @xmath380 is of the order @xmath460 , and the more detailed information in theorem  [ eq1overht ] reveals a gamma distribution containing information of the arrival process , service times , and the back - off function .",
    "\\(ii ) when @xmath9 decays faster than @xmath461 , for instance @xmath462 with @xmath463 , it is shown that the heavy - traffic behavior of the system is as if the back - off periods do not exist .",
    "the intuition is that when @xmath459 , the system spends most of the time in states of large queue sizes in which the probability of initiating a back - off becomes negligible .",
    "indeed , in theorem  [ eqaiht ] it is shown that for @xmath464 with @xmath463 the heavy - traffic behavior of the system is the same as that of an m / g/1 system without back - offs .",
    "\\(iii ) when @xmath9 decays slower than @xmath461 , for instance for @xmath465 with @xmath463 , it is shown that the heavy - traffic behavior of the system is completely determined by the back - offs .",
    "theorem  [ degenerate ] says that for @xmath466 with @xmath463 the mean number of customers is @xmath467 , while the stationary distribution of the number of customers is degenerate and thus strongly concentrated around its mean .",
    "hence , for systems with such back - offs , the heavy - traffic behavior is entirely different from that of systems without back - off ( the m / g/1 system in this case ) .",
    "another relevant observation that follows from the analysis is that the order of the number of customers in the system  @xmath63 in heavy traffic is independent of the mean length of the vacation and service times in all three modes .",
    "the revealed trichotomy for the single - node system provides some important insights for the wireless networks equipped with back - off rules similar as discussed in section  [ intro ] , because the single - node system provides a _ best - case scenario _ for networks with multiple nodes . to see this ,",
    "first notice that for a network to be in heavy traffic , the aggregated traffic intensity in some clique , a set of nodes of which at most one can be active at the same time , tends to @xmath265 .",
    "the total number of packets in this clique behaves like the number of packets in the corresponding single - node system with two modifications .",
    "first , the probability to go into back - off is based on a subset of all customers .",
    "hence the network will be in back - off more often if @xmath9 is decreasing and the total number of customers in both systems were equal .",
    "second , the length of the vacation period is the minimum over the back - off lengths of all non - blocked nodes , which might change during the vacation period .",
    "we thus see that the vacation length is at least equal to the minimum back - off length of a node in the clique assuming none of the nodes is prevented from activating .",
    "hence , taking this minimum as the actual vacation length in the corresponding single - node system , we see that vacations in the network always take at least as long as in the single - node system .",
    "as both modifications intuitively have a negative impact on the delay performance , it seems reasonable to assume that the total number of packets in the network is at best equal to the total number of customers in the corresponding single - node system .",
    "we thus see that more aggressive activation schemes can potentially improve the delay performance . on the other hand , however , these aggressive activation schemes may fail to achieve maximum stability and hence are unstable in heavy traffic .",
    "maximum stability for general networks is only guaranteed when @xmath468 ( see @xcite ) which , based on the analysis in this paper , might result in very poor delay performance in heavy traffic .",
    "an interesting topic for further research is to establish for which scenarios the delay performance in the network is roughly equal to the delay performance of the corresponding single - node system .",
