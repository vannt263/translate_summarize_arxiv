    "many efforts have been stimulated over the years by the theoretical prediction that there exists an infinite three - dimensional , periodic structure that exhibits a three - dimensional ( 3d ) photonic band gap  @xcite . in this frequency range",
    "the density of optical states ( dos ) is zero and vacuum fluctuations are inhibited .",
    "this characteristic property of the 3d bandgap crystal leads to novel phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed )  @xcite where they offer at least five prospects for new physics .",
    "firstly and probably the most eagerly pursued phenomenon is the complete inhibition of spontaneous emission .",
    "any interaction mediated by vacuum fluctuations is affected by their suppression in the bandgap  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a crystal with a 3d photonic bandgap not only inhibits spontaneous emission - including a shift of the emitter s frequency known as the lamb shift  @xcite - it will also modify the spectrum of blackbody radiation  @xcite , it will affect resonant dipole - dipole interactions including the van der waals and casimir forces  @xcite , and the well - known frster resonant energy transfer that is prominent in biology and chemistry  @xcite . secondly , once a bandgap is achieved , the cqed physics becomes even richer by introducing point defects .",
    "a point defect acts as a tiny cavity that is shielded in all three dimensions from the vacuum by the surrounding crystal  @xcite .",
    "hence such a photonic bandgap cavity is literally a `` nanobox for light '' .",
    "a third reason why 3d photonic bandgaps are relevant to solid state cqed occurs when a gain medium is introduced in a nanobox .",
    "such a nanobox with gain offers the promise of a thresholdless laser  @xcite .",
    "fourth , an important research theme in cqed is the breaking of the weak - coupling approximation .",
    "there are several ways to break the weak - coupling limit .",
    "one approach is to operate close to a van hove singularity where the density of states has a cusp  @xcite . a second approach to break the weak - coupling limit consists of rapidly modulating the `` bath '' that surrounds a two - level quantum emitter  @xcite , using ultrafast all - optical switching methods  @xcite .",
    "fifth , in quantum physics there is an active interest in decoherence , that is , the loss of coherence between the components of a system that is in a quantum superposition  @xcite .",
    "hence the shielding of vacuum fluctuations by a 3d photonic bandgap offers opportunities to make optical quantum systems robust to decoherence .",
    "recently , there have been great attempts to make 3d photonic band gap crystals which show a 3d photonic band gap  @xcite . in practice",
    "a real photonic crystal is of course always finite .",
    "therefore the dos , that is an average over all of space , can not describe the optical states in a _",
    "finite _ system . for an inhomogeneous system , including finite crystals we need to take into account local properties and therefore we need to calculate the local density of states ( ldos ) . having a finite crystal",
    "fundamentally changes the main features of the ldos .",
    "first of all the ldos that is zero in the band gap of an infinite crystal  @xcite , becomes non - zero in the band gap of a finite crystal  @xcite .",
    "moreover , within the bandgap of an infinite crystal the ldos does not depend on frequency or position ; in stark contrast in the bandgap of a finite crystal the ldos does depend on frequency , position , and the crystal size . to date , most theories assume crystals of infinite extent ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , and can thus not be used to interpret experimental results on real crystals as first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . to the best of our knowledge the ldos in the band gap of a finite 3d photonic crystal has not been studied yet as a function of the crystal size and the position in the crystal and there is no analytic theory to calculate the ldos for any class of crystal .",
    "several groups have calculated optical properties of finite bandgap crystals : interesting work has been done to calculate the dos ( but not the ldos ) for 1d - waves in the band gap of a finite 1d crystal by bendickson _",
    "et al . _",
    "the ldos for 2d waves has been calculated in the band gap of a 2d photonic crystals by asatryan _",
    "_ as a function of position , crystal size , and frequency  @xcite .",
    "the 3d ldos has been calculated for 1d and 2d crystals that do not have a 3d gap  @xcite . for 3d light in a 3d inverse opal , hermann and hess have calculated the ldos as a function of frequency , position , and for several position in the crystal by means of finite difference time domain simulations  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , the results can not be applied to other crystals , physical insights are not readily apparent , as is intrinsic to simulations , and finally such calculations requires a lot of programming efforts and computational costs .",

    "the source is located at a depth @xmath0 .",

    "the shading in the crystal lightens away from the interface to illustrate the decreasing ldos with depth into the crystal @xmath1 . ]    in this paper we introduce a new point of view on the band gap in a finite photonic crystal , which allows for simplified calculations based on physical principles .",
    "we consider a photonic band gap in a finite crystal to be the result of vacuum fluctuations in free space that tunnel into the forbidden zone where the fluctuations are exponentially damped .",

    "while our model is ultimately intended to calculate the ldos inside the band gap of a finite 2 or 3-dimensional photonic crystal as a function of position in the crystal , crystal size , and frequency , in this paper we will limit ourselves to a 1d structure .",
    "the reason is that the electromagnetic field propagation and the band structure in 1d can be calculated analytically , therefore we can test our model by comparing with the analytic calculations .",

    "[ eq : lrdos - general ] is that the delta function @xmath10 filters the relevant emission frequency from the collection of photonic states .",
    "since in the band gap of an infinite crystal there are no propagating modes , the delta function causes the ldos to become zero in this frequency range .    to calculate the ldos for a finite photonic crystal we modify the ldos equation for an infinite photonic crystal .",

    "this model describes that at a depth @xmath13 inside a finite photonic band gap crystal the vacuum modes that enter the crystal in a certain direction @xmath14 are exponentially damped .",
    "the second factor is about the modes in the finite crystal .",

    "we propose to employ lorentzian functions instead of the delta functions , where the linewidth of the lorentzian is set by the crystal size @xmath15 .",
    "these assumptions are used to calculate ldos in the band gap of 1d photonic crystal as a function of frequency , depth in the crystal , and the crystal size .    in this paper",

    "<S> we compare our proposed model to exact calculations in one dimension using the transfer matrix method and find very good agreement . </S>",
