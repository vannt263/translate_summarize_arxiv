    "variational monte carlo is a powerful tool to calculate the properties of quantum systems . in general ,",
    "expectation values of physical quantities over conveniently chosen variational wavefunctions allow the application of monte carlo sampling methods . for fermionic lattice models ,",
    "commonly used variational wavefunctions are the gutzwiller  @xcite and baeriswyl  @xcite wavefunctions ( gwf and bwf , respectively ) .",
    "the gwf starts with a non - interacting wavefunction , and projects out configurations according to the interaction . for fermionic systems ,",
    "evaluation of physical quantities can be done approximately via a combinatorial approximation , or exactly in the case of the one - dimensional  @xcite and the infinite  @xcite dimensional case . in between those two cases",
    "the state - of - the - art is the monte carlo method developed by yokoyama and shiba  @xcite . for bosonic systems ,",
    "the gwf reduces to mean - field theory  @xcite .",
    "the bwf can be considered the counterpart of the gwf : the starting point is the wavefunction with inifinite interaction , and the projection applied thereonto is a function of the hopping energy . for fermionic systems",
    "this wavefunction already has a history  @xcite . for a model of interacting spinless fermions",
    "the bwf produces excellent results for the ground state energy  @xcite .",
    "we note also , that a method known as the momentum dependent local ansatz , in which momentum dependent amplitudes of pairs are used as variational parameters , was recently developed  @xcite .",
    "while there are a number of schemes to solve the bwf for fermionic systems , it has , to the best of our knowledge , not been applied to bosonic systems .    in this work",
    "we develop a variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method for correlated bosonic models based on the bwf and apply it to the bosonic hubbard model  @xcite ( bhm ) with on - site interaction .",
    "the bhm was originally proposed to study actual materials ( bosons in porous materials ) , but they were recently also realized experimentally as ultra - cold gases in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the bhm has been treated by analytical and numerical means , including mean - field theory  @xcite , perturbative expansion  @xcite , quantum monte carlo ( qmc )  @xcite , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite , and exact diagonalization ( ed )  @xcite .",
    "dmrg is limited to one dimension , qmc is limited to small system sizes , and ed is limited to even smaller system sizes .",
    "our variational monte carlo approach is shown to give good quantitative results , at the same time , it is not restricted to one dimension , and is less computationally demanding than qmc or ed .",
    "it can also be generalized to more complex bosonic strongly correlated models with distance dependent interaction , and/or disorder .",
    "we calculate some of the properties of the bhm .",
    "as expected , the ground state energy obtained using our vmc method has a lower value than the one given by mean - field theory .",
    "more importantly , for the phase diagram , our results are in excellent quantitative agreement with the quantum monte carlo results of rousseau _ et al . _",
    "we also obtain the kosterlitz - thouless point at the tip of the mott lobes , and find that our calculations underestimate the values calculated by others  @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the one - particle reduced density matrix at integer and away from integer fillings . for integer fillings we find decay to zero .",
    "the decay is well approximated by an exponential function , implying the absende of a condensate .",
