    "the star formation rate ( @xmath0 ) is a fundamental property of any galaxy at any epoch .",
    "star formation is a process intimately connected to the dusty interstellar medium ( ism ) of a galaxy , at any epoch following the formation of its first - generation stars .",
    "attenuation of stellar radiation at different wavelengths by internal dust is an extremely complex topic heavily discussed in the literature ( see calzetti 2001 for a review ) but its full understanding is still far from being at reach .",
    "hence astronomers have tried to limit , if not overcome , this serious problem by devising various methods for the determination of @xmath0s , in starbursts as well as in normal ( i.e. , non - starburst and non - agn dominated ) late - type galaxies ( see kennicutt 1998 for a review ) .",
    "these methods , based on different astrophysical phenomena , reach different quantitative conclusions in general ( see charlot et al .",
    "2002 for a discussion ) .",
    "even when the astrophysical mechanisms at the basis of these methods produce radiation at wavelengths where dust attenuation is less effective or not effective at all ( e.g. the thermal emission from dust at ir  mm wavelengths or the non - thermal , synchrotron emission at radio wavelengths ) , there is no easy link between these radiation processes and @xmath0 for normal late - type galaxies ( e.g. popescu et al .",
    "2000 ; bell 2002 ; pierini et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "the relation between dust emission in the far - ir and @xmath0 in nearby ( i.e. , at redshift @xmath14 ) starbursts ( kennicutt 1998 ) has recently been subject of particular interest , owing to the discovery of a relevant dust - enshrouded phase of the cosmological star formation history ( see hauser & dwek 2001 for a review ) .",
    "the existence of an analogous relation for nearby , normal late - type galaxies is still unclear , for the following reasons .",
    "first , the origin of dust heating is still under debate ( see bell 2003 for a discussion ) .",
    "the pioneering work of buat & xu ( 1996 ) pointed to non - ionizing , far - uv photons as the main source of dust heating in nearby , normal late - type galaxies .",
    "this has been confirmed by modeling of the optical to far - ir  submm spectral energy distributions ( seds ) available for a few such objects ( popescu et al .",
    "2000 ; misiriotis et al .",
    "nevertheless the latter studies show that the contribution to dust heating of optical and near - ir photons is not negligible , consistent with interpretations of the mass - normalized far - ir / radio correlation ( xu et al .",
    "1994 ) , and of the behaviour of the [ cii](158 @xmath1 ) line - to - far - ir continuum emission ratio as a function of the h@xmath7(0.656 @xmath1 ) equivalent width ( pierini , leech & vlk 2003a ) .",
    "second , the standard estimate of dust emission in the far - ir , i.e. , the _ iras _ 40120 @xmath1 flux `` @xmath15 '' ( helou et al .",
    "1988 ) , may underestimate the total dust emission at far - ir  mm wavelengths by a factor up to 3 ( popescu & tuffs 2002 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the _ iras _ spectral bands could not probe the relevant contribution to the far - ir  mm continuum of the emission from `` cold '' ( i.e. , with a median temperature of 18 @xmath16 ) dust ( popescu et al .",
    "2002 ) , rather smoothly distributed over the disk ( haas et al . 1998",
    "; hippelein et al . 2003 ) .",
    "popescu & tuffs ( 2002 ) find that the mean fraction of stellar light re - radiated by dust at 401000 @xmath1 is about 30 per cent among the normal virgo cluster late - type galaxies observed by tuffs et al .",
    "( 2002a , b ) with _ isophot _ ( lemke et al . 1996 ) .",
    "they also find that this fraction is about 15 per cent for early - type spirals and up to about 50 per cent in some late - type disk - galaxies .",
    "third , dust attenuation depends on the dust / stars configuration ( i.e. , geometry ) , structure of the dusty ism , dust amount and absorption / scattering properties of the mix of dust grains ( e.g. bianchi , ferrara & giovanardi 1996 ; kuchinski et al .",

    "the grain properties may depend significantly on uv field ( gordon , calzetti & witt 1997 ) .",
    "fourth , dust attenuation in the optical and near - ir seems to increase with luminosity for nearby , normal late - type galaxies ( giovanelli et al .",
    "1995 ; tully et al .",
    "1998 ; masters , giovanelli & haynes 2003 ) .",
    "this is not at odds with the result of popescu & tuffs ( 2002 ) .",
    "late - type spirals and irregulars have bluer optical - to - near - ir colours than early - type spirals ( e.g. boselli et al .",
    "1997 ) , which may indicate that the former galaxies reach their maximum star formation activity more recently than the latter ones ( e.g. kennicutt 1998 ; gavazzi , pierini & boselli 1996 ) .",
    "thus they are expected to produce relatively more far - uv photons than optical and , especially , near - ir ones .",
    "however the far - uv photons are the most affected by dust attenuation ( e.g. calzetti 2001 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the relation between far - ir luminosity and far - uv luminosity ( produced by stars formed in recent episodes of star formation ) for nearby , normal late - type galaxies , taking into account the observational result that dust attenuation depends on luminosity .",
    "we investigate how the 401000 @xmath1-to-0.165 @xmath1 luminosity ratio behaves as a function of the near - ir luminosity ( or dynamical mass  e.g. gavazzi et al .",

    "disk metallicity increases with luminosity ( zaritsky , kennicutt & huchra 1994 ) but the mass - fractions of atomic , molecular and total ( i.e. , atomic@xmath56molecular ) hydrogen seem to decrease with luminosity ( gavazzi et al .",

    "second , in opposition to the far - uv luminosity , the k - band luminosity is produced also by old stars , part of them residing also in the central , ellipsoidal bulge , if any .",
    "intuitively , the difference in dust / stars distribution between bulge and disk components of a bulge@xmath56disk system is expected to produce different attenuation curves for these two components , for fixed properties of the dusty ism and galaxy inclination .",
    "everything else being fixed , the attenuation curve of a bulge@xmath56disk system will depend on the @xmath57-dependent bulge - to - disk luminosity ratio .",
    "thus , @xmath9 and @xmath7 will depend on the bulge - to - disk k - band luminosity ratio and , thus , on k - band luminosity , since this ratio increases with k - band luminosity ( e.g. graham 2001 ) .",

    "the monte carlo simulations of multiple - scattering radiative transfer by witt & gordon discuss in detail the dependence of @xmath17 on geometry , structure of the dusty ism ( homogeneous vs. two - phase clumpy ) , dust column density ( parameterized by @xmath62 is the value of the radial attenuation optical depth at v band ( 0.55 @xmath1 ) , from the center to the edge of the dust environment , where dust has a constant density , homogeneous distribution .",

    "the previous estimates of @xmath7 and @xmath13 must be considered `` cum grano salis '' . in particular , they constitute lower and upper limits , respectively .    the results of fig .",
    "2 can also be interpreted in the framework of the charlot & fall ( 2000 ) models , which describe the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies , based on an idealized description of the ism .",
    "one of the key features of these models is the accounting of the different attenuations affecting young and old stars in galaxies , as manifested through the different attenuation of line and continuum photons ( calzetti 2001 ) .",

    "the attenuation optical depth affecting stars older than @xmath63 yr is one third of the attenuation optical depth at v band @xmath64 seen by young stars , we find that , for @xmath65 ( 8.0 ) , @xmath7 ranges from 10.6 to 12.9 ( 6.3 to 6.9 ) at ages between 0.3 and 6.0 gyr .",
    "if the ratio of the attenuation optical depths affecting old and young stars is lowered from 0.3 to 0.1 , @xmath7 is found to range from 16.6 to 29.5 ( 6.4 to 8.5 ) .",
    "overall , this implies @xmath660.48 , with @xmath13 increasing with decreasing @xmath64 at fixed age .    at this point",
    "the reader may wonder how a change of the bulge - to - disk luminosity ratio affects the solid - angle averaged values of @xmath7 and @xmath13 .",
    "honestly , it is hard to predict the results of radiative transfer models for a bulge@xmath56disk geometry .",
    "intuitively , however , we may expect that the inclination - averaged attenuation optical depth at optical / near - ir wavelengths is larger for the bulge than for the disk , since , for most of the possible values of @xmath3 , roughly half of the bulge light will be affected by the dustiest , central region of the dusty double - exponential disk , while the disk light is affected by the whole , extended dust distribution .",
    "we may use the charlot & fall models to describe this effect .",
    "an increasing bulge - to - disk luminosity ratio would imply that the attenuation optical depth of the old stars increases with respect to the attenuation optical depth of the stars younger than @xmath63 years .",
    "as shown before , an increase of this ratio ( e.g. from 0.1 to 0.3 ) would decrease @xmath7 . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath13 is positive over a wide range of luminosities and hubble types and increases with increasing k - band luminosity obtained from different models .",
    "anyway , we do not expect eventual differences to erase our conclusion on the parameter @xmath13 , since all the models of dust attenuation predict that @xmath17 becomes `` greyer '' ( i.e. , that @xmath7 decreases ) when the dust amount increases . ] .    the main uncertainty in eq .",
    "8 is the sign of the parameter @xmath13 at the very - faint end of the galaxy k - band luminosity function .",
    "in fact , both the witt & gordon ( 2000 ) and the charlot & fall ( 2000 ) models predict large values of @xmath7 for very low attenuations ( i.e. , very low luminosities ) .",
    "hence the precise value of @xmath13 for the least luminous galaxies depends critically on the statistical behaviours determined from fig . 2 of this work ( eq .",
    "2 ) , and from fig . 13 of masters et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( eq .",
    "to summarise , @xmath67 and @xmath6 seem to increase together for a wide range in dust and stellar population parameters .",
    "thus our analysis points toward the absence of a universal ratio of far - ir luminosity to unattenuated far - uv luminosity for normal late - type galaxies at @xmath18 .",
    "the relative contribution of the emission in the far - uv to the bolometric stellar luminosity of a galaxy is expected to decrease with increasing k - band luminosity ( or dynamical mass  gavazzi et al .",
    "1996 ) or towards earlier spirals ( kennicutt 1998 ) . in this case ,",
    "the larger fraction of optical / near - ir photons produced by the stellar populations and the larger attenuation at these wavelengths positively couple together so that the relative contribution of the far - uv photons to dust heating decreases .",
    "thus the far - ir luminosity systematically overestimates @xmath0 in more luminous , earlier spiral galaxies , where a larger fraction of the dust heating is due to optical / near - ir photons , emitted by intermediate / low - mass stars formed mostly in relatively old episodes of star formation .",
    "conversely , it systematically underestimates @xmath0 in less luminous , later spiral / irregular galaxies , where the maximum star formation activity is more recent but the far - uv attenuation optical depth is lower .    the limited statistics and the uncertainty affecting the scaling relations that we determine ( eq . 2 and 6 )",
    "do not allow us to establish quantitative conclusions , but an analogous analysis making use of larger data - sets , available in the near future ( e.g. from _ galex _ , _ astro - f _ and _ sirtf _ ) , and of more advanced models will allow a quantitative test of our conclusions .",
