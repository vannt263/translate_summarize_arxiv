    "radiative decays of @xmath2 are considered as a source of gluon enhanced channels relevant to searching for glueball states predicted by qcd ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "this belief is based on the consideration of diagrams for the annihilation of charm - quarks composing the initial state as shown in fig .",
    "[ rad - gg]a .",
    "the two - gluon state can further covert to both gluonic hadrons and light quarks ( see fig .",
    "[ rad - gg]b ) , that produces the mixing of pure glueballs with the ordinary quark matter . a common belief stands that the photon coupling to light quarks causes the suppression of amplitude by @xmath3 due to the additional exchange by the hard gluon ( see fig .",
    "[ rad - gg]c ) , that yields the isoscalar dominance in the radiative @xmath2-decays , since the contribution due to the electromagnetic current of light quarks causing the isospin breaking is suppressed .",
    "however , the exclusive branching fractions , in practice , are actually suppressed with respect to inclusive ones by an order of magnitude , in fact .",
    "therefore , the yields of hadrons with large gluonic components in the radiative decays of vector charmonium could be of the same order as the yield of ordinary hadrons due to diagrams accompanying one in fig . [",
    "rad - gg]c .",
    "this point could be straightforwardly checked by searching for the isospin breaking radiative decays .",
    "indeed , the isospin breaking component of diagrams with electromagnetic current coupled to light quarks ( fig .",
    "[ rad - gg]c ) does not interfere with the dominant contribution of isoscalar channel ( fig .",
    "[ rad - gg]a and b ) .",
    "therefore , one could test the magnitude of isospin breaking channels by investigating the transitions to isotriplet scalar and pseudoscalar particles and @xmath4 , if one considers the virtual photons as it was studied in @xcite , wherein a role of isospin breaking was also emphasized . ]",
    "( the isospin @xmath5 ) . the transition to @xmath6 is measured , and it is suppressed by two orders of magnitude in comparison with decays to isosinglet pseudoscalar particles , which can include large gluonic components .",
    "then , the scalar channel is of interest .",
    "it could be represented by the @xmath7 mode , for instance . in the present paper",
    "we evaluate the branching fraction of this channel in the framework of simple factorizing the isoscalar heavy - light mixing and electromagnetic transition of isoscalar vector light - quark state into the isotriplet scalar . for this purpose in section [ eval ]",
    "we analyze the effective couplings of the isosinglet vector states with isotriplets ones and show that the current data on the radiative decays allow us to extract relevant mixing multiplied by form - factors in order to predict the widths of @xmath7 .",
    "the result derived is discussed in section [ conc ] .",
    "let us introduce effective dimensionless couplings @xmath8 and @xmath9 of vector isoscalar particle @xmath10 with the neutral isotriplet pseudoscalar @xmath6 and scalar @xmath11 in amplitudes of radiative decays as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the strength tensor of electromagnetic field @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 denotes its dual tensor @xmath17 while @xmath18 is the strength tensor of vector @xmath19 . for brevity",
    "we include the product of effective electric charges @xmath20 and @xmath21 into the definition of couplings @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "then , we easily get the widths of decays @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the photon energy @xmath24    the experimental values of measured branching fractions @xcite approximately yield the effective couplings to the neutral pion)([tf2 ] ) reproduce those of derived in @xcite after appropriate rescaling in definition : @xmath25 . ] @xmath26 that spectacularly shows order by order decreasing of effective couplings with stepping to more heavy vector state .",
    "such the regularity can be understood in a simple manner .",
    "the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ rad - gg1 ] describes the mixing of vector isoscalar quark states in the lowest order of qcd coupling constant .",
    "therefore , the mixing does exist , though its evaluation is beyond the perturbation theory .",
    "the hierarchy of couplings in ( [ tf])([tf2 ] ) implies that we could represent the transition of more heavy states @xmath27 and @xmath2 by the mixing with @xmath28 and further radiative decay , i.e. @xmath29 the @xmath30-factors include both the mixing amplitude and form - factors caused by the virtuality of @xmath28-propagation . therefore , these factors can not be straightforwardly extracted from the phenomenology of @xmath28@xmath27-mixing , say .        in this way",
    "we find the @xmath30-factors @xmath31    supposing the same mechanism for the radiative decay to isotriplet scalar meson @xmath11 , we put @xmath32 while the experimental value of @xmath33 yields @xmath34 that results in effective value of coupling for the kinematically forbidden decay @xmath35 as well as the quantity of interest @xmath36 giving @xmath37 where the uncertainty is dominated by experimental one in the measurement of radiative decays of @xmath2 to pion as well as @xmath27 to @xmath11 , while the theoretical uncertainty could be additionally included _ ad hoc _ at the level of 20% , characteristic for the exclusive modelling the virtual process of mixing and form - factors .",
    "the only experimental data available to the moment for the relevant process is presented by @xmath38 that should be compared with expected @xmath39 while the neutral modes of @xmath40 decay in such final states of @xmath2 decay are not available yet .",
    "we see that the resonant @xmath11-contribution due to the cascade decay with the @xmath41 final state could give about 10% of branching ratio summed over all modes as we expect .",
    "the main conclusion of estimate obtained is the following : the ordinary quark states could compose a considerable fraction of radiative @xmath2-decay in contrast to usual assumption on the enhancement of gluonic component .",
    "moreover , the isospin breaking effects could be essential .",
    "thus , the simple treatment of resonances in the scalar channel as the probable glueball states is under question .",
    "the critical point of estimate is the factorization of mixing form - factors and effective couplings .",
    "this suggestion is natural .",
    "the resulting mixing factors are small , that should support the assumption .",
    "however , the suppression of mixing could lead to the method suffers from small effects breaking the factorization . for instance",
    ", the light quark states , @xmath28 , @xmath11 or @xmath27 with the hidden strangeness could get a small admixture of four - quark states .",
    "then , the admixture would break the factorization .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the four - quark mechanism gets a significant suppression , since in the exclusive modes one should include the annihilation of additional quark - antiquark pair .",
    "therefore , we expect that the method used is able to present the real estimate for the isospin breaking effect in the radiative @xmath2-decay to @xmath11 .        * * q.  zhao , g.  li and c.  h.  chang , phys .",
