    "radiative - transfer modeling of supernova ( sn ) ia is a challenging enterprise ( @xcite , hereafter d13 ) . for a start ,",
    "the initial ejecta conditions for such simulations are uncertain .",
    "the possibility of both single- and double - degenerate progenitor systems suggests that the ejecta mass likely varies amongst sn ia ejecta ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ejecta composition that results from the combustion of a c / o white dwarf is not known with confidence because the explosion scenario , besides being non unique , involves hard - to - model combustion physics @xcite . as a result , for each scenario , simulations of the explosion , whether 1-d or multi - d , are parametrized rather than modeled consistently from first principles @xcite .",
    "the progenitor is likely to depart from a simple hydrostatic configuration for many possible reasons including fast rotation @xcite , the conditions produced by the smoldering phase and ignition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , or from the complex dynamical evolution in a merger event @xcite .",
    "even if the ejecta properties were accurately known , the modeling of the radiation would remain challenging because of the prevalence of line opacity , the strong influence of scattering resulting from the very low gas densities in the fast expanding low mass ejecta , the importance of non - lte and time - dependent effects , and non - thermal processes .",
    "perhaps even more important are the numerous processes that take place between the various constituents of the gas ( electrons and ions ) , involving thousands of atomic levels , and which control its thermodynamic state . historically , this complexity has generally been interpreted in terms of an  opacity \" problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in @xcite , we demonstrate that the temperature and ionization distribution , which are difficult to determine accurately , are also important ( not surprisingly ) because the thermodynamic state of the gas determines which ions provide the opacity .",
    "we found , for example , that forbidden lines are crucial , as early as bolometric maximum , in controling the cooling of the ejecta .",
    "paradoxically , these lines have low oscillator strengths , and thus tend to be ignored in simulations prior to @xmath0100d after explosion .",
    "finally , inaccuracies in the atomic data , or the lack of atomic data altogether , introduce a major source of uncertainty in any radiative transfer modeling of sne ia .",
    "a central problem with sne in general is that lines are strongly doppler broadened by the fast expansion of the ejecta .",
    "the large metal mass fraction in sne ia leads to the presence of forests of lines which overlap , typically preventing the identification of a",
    " clean \" line anywhere in their spectra .",
    "the emerging radiation is in addition strongly influenced by a few strong lines , such as si6355  or the ca  triplet , giving the wrong impression that the spectrum is analogous to a blackbody influenced by a few spectral features of large optical depth .",
    "this situation is particularly problematic when sne ia evolve past maximum because at such times , the optical depth clearly drops , the ejecta turns nebular , but strong lines are still present .",
    "there are no regions with negligible flux , even though the continuum optical depth is well below unity even at bolometric maximum @xcite .",
    "after bolometric maximum , the peaks and valleys of sn ia spectra are a complex blend of numerous lines , some thick , others thin , each interacting with hundreds of other lines either locally ( within a sobolev length ) or non - locally ( because redshifted into resonance with a redder line ) .",
    "this conspires to produce confusion about spectrum formation in sne ia . the concept of a  photosphere \" is routinely used but",
    "the notion of a sharp boundary from where radiation would escape does not hold for sne ia . @xcite",
    "propose that most / all lines at nebular times are permitted ( generally resonance ) transitions , while numerous papers emphasize the near exclusive presence of forbidden - line transitions @xcite .    to give additional evidence for the importance of forbidden lines in sne ia @xcite",
    ", we focus here on the 5900  feature observed in post - maximum sn ia spectra . in recent years",
    ", this feature has been associated with nad , although this association remains suspicious and puzzling .",
    "models sometimes provide a very good fit ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) , a poor fit @xcite , or predict no feature at that location @xcite . in the next section , we give an historical perspective of earlier work that modeled or discussed the spectral feature at 5900 .",
    "we then present results from our grid of delayed - detonation and pulsational - delayed - detonation models covering a range of  mass and show that this feature can be explained as [ co]5888  emission , across the range from sub - luminous to standard sne ia ( section  [ sect_res ] ) .",
    "in other words , we find that such ejecta models naturally produce an emission feature at 5900 , and that this emission in our models is systematically associated with [ co]5888 .",
    "our conclusions and a discussion of future work are presented in section  [ sect_conc ] .",
    "far from being a banal characteristic of sn ia spectra , the observation of the [ co]5888   line indicates that forbidden line transitions have to be incorporated in any sn ia model at and beyond bolometric maximum , not just to reproduce observations , but also to compute correctly the cooling of sn ia ejecta .",
    "the spectral feature at 5900  in sne ia has been discussed repeatedly in the last two decades .",
    "we can separate the studies focusing on the  photospheric \" phase ( epochs until soon after bolometric maximum ) and those devoted to  advanced \" nebular phase ( beyond 100d after explosion when the sn exhibits an apparently pure - emission spectrum ) .",
    "@xcite is probably the first to study nebular - phase spectra of sne ia , and he associates unambiguously the 5900  feature with the forbidden transition of co  at 5888 .",
    "later , @xcite present numerical developments incorporated into the code eddington , and apply their technique to spectrum formation in a sn ia ejecta at 250d after explosion .",
    "they propose  as the origin of the 5900feature ( see their fig .  5 ) .",
    "@xcite use the simultaneous presence of [ co]5888  and [ fe]4658  ( strictly speaking , the 4500 - 5000  region contains lines from both feand fe ) in sn ia spectra to confirm the radioactive decay of  at the origin of the sn ia luminosity .",
    "indeed , they find the flux ratio of these two lines ( ignoring line overlap and some complications of the radiative transfer ) can be explained from the decay of  to .",
    "they discard the possible association of the 5900  feature with na .",
    "@xcite study sn1991bg at both early times and late times . at nebular times , they propose that the 5900  feature is primarily associated with [ co ] , and show how this co forbidden transition may be used to set constraints on the original  mass .",
    "their nebular model reproduces the 5900  feature , in both strength and width ( see their fig .",
    "14 ) , supporting the same assessment made by @xcite .",
    ".summary of nucleosynthetic yields for the chandrasekhar - mass delayed - detonation models used in this work .",
    "numbers in parenthesis correspond to powers of ten . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a further confirmation of this association is that the observed strength of the 5900  feature typically increases after bolometric maximum . in the context of [ co ] emission , this also makes sense since the strength of forbidden lines relative to other lines should increase as the ejecta density drops .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_seq ] a montage of spectra for the evolution of sn2005cf and model pddel3 @xcite from bolometric maximum ( i.e. , + 0d ) until + 80d ( we note that model ddc10 studied in detail in d13 does a somewhat better job in the @xmath1-band region , but model pddel3 is more compatible with the narrow line profiles of sn2005cf ; both models are equally suitable for the present discussion ) . as in fig .",
    "[ fig_grid ] , we show the flux associated with the [ co]5888  line as a filled red area .",
    "it is clearly evident that early after bolometric maximum , flux from that forbidden line contributes to the emergent radiation , and that this flux contribution increases with time , as observed .",
    "we note that at bolometric maximum , [ co]5888  line emission is already a strong coolant of the co - rich layers ; [ co]5888  line photons are not seen earlier on because these regions are located below the last scattering / absorbing layer .",
    "there are other [ co ] lines in the 6000  region ( table  [ tab_co3 ] ) .",
    "of all these , the transition at 5888  is the strongest .",
    "the transition at 5906  is expected to be weaker and it also overlaps with the 5888  transition .",
    "the transition at 6195  should be about 1/3 of the strength of 5888  but the model predicts essentially no flux in this line .",
    "we find that the 6195  suffers absorption by overlapping lines , in particular from the si  doublet at 6355 , which is strong at those epochs .",
    "numerous other lines are present in this spectral region , while fewer reside in the 5900  region , allowing the [ co]5888  to escape .",
    "we also find that these low - lying states are in lte with the ground state ( they have the same departure coefficients ) , although we obtain strong depopulation ( and strong departure from lte ) of the ground state of [ co ] through non - thermal ionization and excitation ( this departure is also epoch dependent ) .",
    "scattering is thus expected to influence little the formation of these forbidden - line transitions .",
    "we also see that in our simulations , the delayed detonation models systematically show a range of optical colors at + 40d , while observations look more similar at this time ( fig .",
    "[ fig_grid ] ) .",
    "this is particularly visible for the low - luminosity sn ia 1999by , which shows a stronger [ co]5888  line and relatively less flux in the red than in our model ddc25 .",
    "this range in colors in our models reflects the trend in ionization level at the corresponding epoch , as evidenced by the ionization state of co in the in the inner ejecta where the spectrum forms ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ion ] ) .",
    "this could arise from problems with the atomic physics , or from issues with the structure computed for the assumed progenitor model .",
    "another possible explanation may be that , while the  mass is accurate in each model / observation pair ( tightly constrained by the peak luminosity ) , the ejecta mass of 1.38 , which is kept fixed here , may also vary and in particular involve sub - chandrasekhar mass wds ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for a fixed  mass , reducing the ejecta mass leads naturally to a significant increase in ejecta ionization ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "from this work , we unambiguously discard nad as the origin of the 5900feature in sne ia after bolometric maximum based on 1 ) the prediction of [ co]5888  line emission from all our delayed - detonation models after bolometric maximum ; 2 ) the strengthening of that [ co ] line with time in the first 2 months after bolometric maximum and 3 ) the satisfactory match of our synthetic spectra to the observations .",
    "this finding is not trivial taxonomy because it further confirms our conclusions from the more theoretical discussion in d13 .",
    "although the [ co ] line was identified three decades ago in nebular phase spectra of sne ia @xcite we are discovering the role of [ co ] in sne ia _ as early as bolometric maximum _ , and confirming its identification at later times . lately , a controversial association has been made with nad but this association is not supported by models .",
    "one explanation for the mis - identification is that [ co ] lines are not included in the associated radiative transfer calculations @xcite , as was also done in our earlier modeling of sn ia .",
    "when they are included , the line shows up @xcite .",
    "another explanation is that sn radiative transfer is often done by separate codes for  photospheric \" phase and nebular phase studies , and photospheric codes typically neglect forbidden lines .",
    "unfortunately , this creates a boundary between the two regimes that is artificial .",
    "nebular lines are indeed seen at photospheric epochs , e.g. , the [ ca7300  doublet at the end of the plateau in sne ii - p @xcite or [ co]5888  early after bolometric maximum ; this work ) .",
    "similarly , strong p - cygni profiles , typical of photospheric - phase spectra persist well into the nebular phase .    in the future",
    ", we will investigate the radiative properties of sne ia as they turn nebular .",
    "as shown here , our chandrasekhar - mass delayed - detonation models exhibit a large range of ionization whereas observations appear somewhat degenerate in that respect .",
    "our simulations differ in  mass but have the same ejecta mass of 1.4 .",
    "while the  mass determines the peak luminosity , the ratio of  to ejecta mass is a key ingredient controlling the ionization state of the gas .",
    "hence , we will investigate whether a range of ejecta masses , tied to a narrow range of  to ejecta mass ratio , can reduce the ionization disparity of our models after maximum .",
