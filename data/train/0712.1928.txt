    "in recent years , the statistical properties of complex networks have been extensively investigated by the physics community @xcite . with the increasing computing power of modern computers , analysis of large - scale networks and databases",
    "has become possible .",
    "it has been shown that the degree statistics of many natural and artificial networks follow power law .",
    "examples for such networks vary from social interconnections and scientific collaborations @xcite to the world - wide web @xcite and the internet @xcite .",
    "these networks are usually referred to as _ scale - free _ networks , since the power law distribution indicates that there is no characteristic scale in these systems .     in the early 1960s",
    "erds and rnyi ( er ) introduced random graphs that served as the first mathematical model of complex networks @xcite . in their model ,",
    "the number of nodes is fixed and connections are established randomly , with probability @xmath0 . although the er model leads to rich theory , it fails to predict the power law distributions observed in scale - free networks .",
    "barabsi and albert ( ba ) proposed a more suitable evolving model of these networks @xcite .",
    "the ba model is also based on the random graph theory , but involves two key principles in addition :    _ growth _ , that is , the size of the network is increasing during development , and    _ preferential attachment _ , that is , new network elements are connected to higher degree nodes with higher probability .    in the ba model",
    "every new node connects to the core network with a fixed number of links @xmath1 .",
    "the study of complex networks usually deals with the structural properties of networks , like degree distribution @xcite , shortest path distribution @xcite , degree  degree correlations , clustering @xcite , etc . for complex networks which involve",
    "a transport mechanism _ betweenness _ is the matter of importance . roughly speaking , betweenness is the number of shortest paths passing through a certain network element .",
    "for example , in communication networks information flows between remote hosts via intermediate stations and in the internet data packets are transmitted through routers and cables . the expected traffic flowing through a link or",
    "a router is proportional to the particular edge or node betweenness , respectively .",
    "news and rumors spread in social networks , and node betweenness measures the importance or centrality of an individual in society .",
    "node betweenness has been studied recently by @xcite @xcite , who argued that it follows power law in scale - free networks , and the exponent @xmath2 is independent from the degree distribution in a certain range .",
    "@xcite @xcite used rooted deterministic trees to model scale - free trees , and have found scaling exponent @xmath3 .",
    "the same scaling exponent has been found experimentally by @xcite for scale - free trees .",
    "the rigorous proof of the heuristic results of @xcite has been provided by @xcite in @xcite .    until recently ,",
    "less attention has been paid to edge betweenness , even though edge betweenness is often essential for estimating the load on links in complex networks .",
    "for example , the edge betweenness can measure the `` importance '' of relationships in social networks , or it can measure the expected amount of data flow on links in computer networks .",
    "the probability distribution of edge betweenness gives a rough statistical description of links and it characterizes the network as a whole .",
    "therefore , it is an important tool for an overall description of links in complex networks .    in some cases , a local property of the network",
    "is known as well .",
    "for instance , if the number of friends of any individual can be counted , then it is reasonable to ask the `` importance '' of a relationship ( i.e. an edge in a social network ) under the condition that the number of friends of the related individuals is known . in this case",
    ", the _ conditional _ probability distribution of edge betweenness provides a much finer description of links than the total distribution .    in this paper",
    "we focus on how additional local information could be used to describe links .",
    "in particular , we aim at deriving the probability distribution of edge betweenness in evolving scale - free trees , under the condition that the in - degree of the `` younger '' node of any randomly selected link is known . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we consider the in - degree of the `` younger '' node only . whether a node is `` younger '' than another node or not can be defined uniquely in evolving networks , since nodes attach to the network sequentially .",
    "note that the in - degree is considered instead of total degree for practical reasons only .",
    "the construction of the network implies that the in - degree is less than the total degree by one for every `` younger '' node .    to obtain the desired conditional distribution we calculate the exact joint distribution of cluster size and in - degree for a _ specific _ link first",
    "then , the joint distribution of a _ randomly selected _",
    "link is derived , which is comparable with the edge ensemble statistics obtained from a network realization .",
    "the exact marginal distributions of cluster size and in - degree follow next .",
    "after that , we give the distribution and mean of cluster size under the condition that in - degree is known . for the sake of completeness",
    "the conditional in - degree distribution is presented as well .",
    "finally , the distribution and mean of edge betweenness is derived under the condition that the corresponding in - degree is known .",
    "note that all of our analytic results are _ exact even for finite networks _",
    ", which is valuable since the size of the real networks are often much smaller than the valid range of asymptotic formulae .",
    "moreover , _",
    "exact results for unbounded networks _ are provided as well .    as a model of evolving scale - free trees",
    "we consider the ba model with parameter @xmath4 , extended with initial attractiveness @xcite . with the initial attractiveness the scaling properties of the network can be finely tuned .",
    "note , that in the limit of initial attractiveness to infinity the preferential attachment disappears , and new nodes are connected to the old ones with uniform probability . in this limit",
    "the network looses its scale - free nature and becomes similar to an er network with @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , scale - free and non - scale free networks can be compared within one model . for the sake of simplicity the infinite limit of initial attractiveness",
    "is referred to as the `` er limit '' throughout this paper .",
    "we restrict our model to trees , that is to connected loopless graphs .",
    "the simplicity of trees allows analytic results for edge betweenness , since the shortest paths in trees are unique between any pair of nodes .",
    "although trees are special graphs , a number of real networks can be modelled by trees or by tree - like graphs with only a negligible number of shortcuts .",
    "important examples of such networks are the autonomous systems in the internet @xcite .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] , a short introduction to the construction of ba trees is given .",
    "then , a master equation for the joint distribution of cluster size and in - degree of a specific edge is derived and solved in section  [ sec : cond_joint_prob ] and section  [ sec : sol_master ] , respectively .",
    "the total joint distribution of cluster size is calculated in section  [ sec : joint_prob ] .",
    "the marginal and conditional distributions of cluster size and in - degree are derived in section  [ sec : marginal_prob ] and section  [ sec : cond_prob ] , respectively . in section",
    "[ sec : load_prob ] , the conditional distribution of edge betweenness follows .",
    "finally , we conclude our work and discuss future directions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the concepts of graph theory are used throughout this paper .",
    "a graph consists of _ vertices _ ( nodes ) and _ edges _ ( links ) .",
    "edges are ordered or un - ordered pairs of vertices , depending on whether an ordered or un - ordered graph is considered , respectively .",
    "the _ order _ of a graph is the number of vertices it holds , while the _ degree _ of a vertex counts the number of edges adjacent to it .",
    "_ path _ is also defined in the most natural way : it is a vertex sequence , where any two consecutive elements form an edge .",
    "a path is called a _ simple path _ if none of the vertices in the path are repeated .",
    "any two vertices in a _",
    "tree _ can be connected by a unique simple path .",
    "the graph is called connected if for any vertex pair there exists a path which starts from one vertex and ends at the other .    the construction of the network proceeds in discrete time steps .",
    "let us denote time with @xmath6 , and the developed graph with @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the set of vertices and the set of edges at time step @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "initially , at @xmath11 , the graph consists only of a single vertex without any edges .",
    "then , in every time step , a new vertex is connected to the network with a single edge .",
    "the edge is _ directed _ , which emphasize that the two sides of the edge are not symmetric .",
    "the newly connected node , which is the source of the edge , is always `` younger '' than the target node .",
    "the term `` younger node of a link '' is used in this sense below .",
    "note that the initial vertex is different from all the others , since it has only incoming connections ; we refer to it as the _ root vertex_.    the target of every new edge is selected randomly from the present vertices of the graph .",
    "the probability that a new vertex connects to an old one is proportional to the attractiveness of the old vertex @xmath12 , defined as @xmath13 where parameter @xmath14 denotes the initial attractiveness and @xmath15 is the in - degree of vertex @xmath12 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the in - degree distribution is asymptotically @xmath16 .",
    "we will improve this result and derive the exact in - degree distribution below .",
    "note that in the special case @xmath17 the attractiveness of every node is zero except of the root vertex .",
    "it follows that every new vertex is connected to the initial vertex in this case , which corresponds to a star topology .",
    "the special case @xmath18 practically returns the original ba model .",
    "indeed , except for the root vertex , the attractiveness of every vertex becomes equal to its degree if @xmath18 ; this is exactly the definition of the attractiveness in the ba model @xcite .",
    "finally , if @xmath19 , then preferential attachment disappears in the limit , and the model tends to a poisson - type graph , similar to an er graph .",
    "the attractiveness of sub - graph @xmath20 is the sum of the attractiveness of its elements : @xmath21 we refer to a connected sub - graph as a _",
    "cluster_. the attractiveness of cluster @xmath22 can be given easily : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the size of the cluster .",
    "it is obvious that the overall attractiveness of the network at time step @xmath10 is @xmath25",
    "let us consider the size of the network @xmath26 , an arbitrary edge @xmath27 , which connected vertex @xmath12 to the graph at time step @xmath28 , and let us denote by @xmath22 the cluster which has developed on vertex @xmath12 until @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bamodel ] ) .",
    "the calculation of betweenness of the given edge is straightforward in trees , since the number of shortest paths going through the given edge , that is the betweenness of the edge , is obviously @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to know the size of the cluster on the particular edge to get edge betweenness .",
    "[ c][c]@xmath22 [ c][c]@xmath27 [ c][c]@xmath12 [ c][c]root    the development of cluster @xmath22 can be regarded as a markov process .",
    "the states of the cluster are indexed by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the number of vertices in cluster @xmath22 without @xmath12 .",
    "the in - degree of vertex @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "transition probabilities can be obtained from the definition of preferential attachment : @xmath33 where @xmath340,1\\right]$ ] and @xmath35 denotes the transition probability @xmath36 , and @xmath37 denotes the transition probability @xmath38 , respectively .    the master - equation , which describes the markov process , follows from the fact that cluster @xmath22 can develop to state @xmath31 obviously in three ways : a new vertex can be connected    1 .   to cluster @xmath22 but",
    "not to vertex @xmath12 , and the cluster was in state @xmath39 , 2 .   to vertex @xmath12 , and",
    "the cluster was in state @xmath40 , or 3 .   to the rest of the network , and",
    "the cluster was in state @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the conditional probability @xmath41 that the developed cluster on edge @xmath27 is in state @xmath42 satisfies the following master - equation : @xmath43{{\\mathbb{p}}_{\\tau-1}(n , q\\mid \\tau_e)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the process starts with @xmath44 , @xmath45 at @xmath46 , the initial condition of the above master equation is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the kronecker - delta symbol .",

    "this result coincides with the fact that the size of a cluster @xmath57 can not be less than the corresponding number of in - degrees @xmath15 .",
    "equation provides the conditional probability that a particular edge which was connected to the network at @xmath72 is in state @xmath31 at @xmath29 . in a fully developed network , however , the time when a particular edge is connected to the network is usually not known .",
    "moreover , the development of an individual link is usually not as important as the properties of the finally developed link ensemble .",
    "therefore , we are more interested in the total probability @xmath73 , that is the probability that a randomly selected edge is in state @xmath31 at @xmath10 , than the conditional probability . the total probability can be calculated with the help of the total probability theorem : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the probability that a randomly selected edge was included into the network at @xmath72 . according to the construction of the network one edge",
    "is added to the network at every time step , therefore @xmath76 .",

    ". how could we extend our results to this scenario ?",
    "let us consider a new edge when it is connected to the network .",
    "the in - degree of the new node is obviously @xmath136 .",
    "the in - degree of the other node , which the new node is connected to , is equal to or larger than one . due to preferential attachment",
    "the larger the in - degree is the faster it grows .",
    "even if preferential attachment is absent , the growth rate of every in - degree is the same .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the initial deficit in the in - degree of the `` younger '' node grows or remains at the same level during the evolution of the network .",
    "it follows that it is a reasonable approximation to substitute the in - degree of the `` younger '' node @xmath15 with @xmath235 in our formulae .",
    "a typical network construction problem is to design network infrastructure without wasting precious resources at places where not needed .",
    "an appropriate design strategy is if network resources are allocated proportionally to the expected traffic . in a mean field approximation",
    "the expected traffic is proportional to the number of shortest paths going through a certain network element , that is the betweenness .",
    "the precise calculation of all the betweenness require complete information on the network structure . in real life , however , the number of shortest paths is often impossible to tell because the structure of the network is not fully known .",
    "one of the practical results of this paper is that the expectation of edge betweenness can be estimated precisely when a limited local information on network structure  the in - degree of the `` younger '' node  is available .",
    "another difficulty of network design is that the size of real networks is finite .",
    "moreover , the size of real networks is often so small that asymptotic formulas can be applied only with unacceptable error .",
    "the other important novelty of our results is that the derived formulas are exact even for finite networks , which allows better design of realistic finite size networks .",
    "various statistical properties of evolving random trees have been investigated in this paper .",
    "we have focused on the cluster size , the in - degree and the edge betweenness .",
    "we have considered the @xmath4 case of the ba model extended with initial attractiveness for modeling random trees .",
    "initial attractiveness allows fine tuning of the scaling parameter .",
    "moreover , in the limit of the tuning parameter @xmath81 the applied model tends to a non - scale - free structure , which is in many aspects similar to the classical er model .",
    "therefore , we were able to investigate both the scale - free and the non - scale - free scenario within the same framework .",
    "first , the evolution of cluster size and in - degree of a specific edge have been modeled as a bivariate markov process .",
    "the master equation , associated with the markov process , has led us to a linear partial difference equation .",
    "an exact analytic solution of the master equation , which satisfies the initial conditions as well , has been found .",
    "the solution provides the joint probability distribution of cluster size and in - degree for a specific edge .    using the above results we have derived the joint probability distribution of cluster size and in - degree for a randomly selected edge .",
    "it is of more practical importance than the joint distribution for a specific edge because , in contrast to the former distribution , it provides the statistical description of the whole network .",
    "we also derived the joint distribution in the er limit .",
    "note that the obtained formulae are exact for even finite size networks .",
    "in addition , the formulae for unbounded networks have been presented as well .",
    "we have continued our analysis with the one dimensional marginal distributions .",
    "we have shown some fundamental differences in the scaling properties of the marginal cluster size and in - degree distributions .",
    "the novelty of our results here , compared to previous results in the literature , is that we have found exact analytic formulae not only for the large , but also for the small cluster size and in - degree region .",
    "although the marginal distributions have their own importance , we have derived them in order to obtain conditional probability distributions . from the combination of the joint and the marginal distributions we have given the conditional distributions of cluster size and in - degree .",
    "we have also presented conditional expectations of cluster size and in - degree for both finite and unbounded networks .",
    "we have found that asymptotically the conditional cluster size grows with in - degree to the power of @xmath177 and the conditional in - degree grows with cluster size to the power of @xmath130 , respectively .",
    "the er limit has been discussed as well .",
    "we have shown that the conditional cluster size grows exponentially and the conditional in - degree grows logarithmically when @xmath81 .    finally , by applying the transformation of random variables we have derived the distribution of edge betweenness under the condition that the corresponding in - degree is known .",
    "we have found that the conditional expectation of edge betweenness grows linearly with the size of the network . for the analysis of unbounded networks we have defined the rescaled edge betweenness @xmath219 , and derived its distribution and expectation under the condition that in - degree @xmath15 is provided .",
    "our analytic results have been verified at different network sizes and parameter values by extensive numerical simulations .",
    "we have demonstrated that numerical simulations fully confirm our analytic results .    for the future , we hope that the methods we have developed in this paper allow us to describe cluster size and edge betweenness in more general scenarios . for example , when not only the `` younger '' , but both two in - degrees of links are considered .",
