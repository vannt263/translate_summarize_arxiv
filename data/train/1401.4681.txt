    "kepler s laws describe the way planets move in their orbits about the sun .",
    "geometrically , they say that the planets move in planar elliptical orbits with eccentricity @xmath2 , and that the area swept by the line joining the planet and the sun increases linearly with time , which leads immediately to kepler s equation @xmath1 , relating mean and eccentric anomalies : the mean anomaly is a fictitious angle @xmath13 that increases linearly with time at a rate @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the orbital period , and the eccentric anomaly @xmath5 gives the coordinates of the planet in its orbit plane as @xmath16 . here , the @xmath17-plane has origin at the center of the ellipse with the @xmath18-axis pointing to the perihelion , and the values @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the semi - major and semi - minor axis of the ellipse .",
    "therefore , finding the exact location of a planet at a given time requires solving an instance of kepler s equation for some @xmath13 , assuming that the values @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath15 are known ( actually , only @xmath19 and @xmath21 are needed , since @xmath22 and @xmath15 can be obtained from @xmath19 using the third law ) . for a derivation of these formulas , and a detailed introduction to kepler s equation ,",

    "however , we want to calculate the solution with arbitrary precision , hence our interest in iterative techniques .",
    "kepler himself proposed to use a fixed - point iteration to solve the equation  ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the guessing part , however , requires some specific understanding on the equation and has been the subject of many recent papers ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "starters have been compared ( and optimized ) using different criteria , such as the number of iterations needed to reach certain precision , the distance to the actual solution , the number of floating point operations needed for its computation , etc . for this purpose",
