    "methane ( ch@xmath5 ) is the most fundamental hydrocarbon molecule in space , and is thought to play an important role in interstellar chemistry and planetary chemistry .",
    "the gas phase ch@xmath5 has been identified toward bright infrared sources like high - mass young stellar objects by observing the infrared vibration - rotation spectra of the @xmath8 ( c - h stretching : 3  @xmath9 m ) and @xmath10 ( ch@xmath11 bending : 7  @xmath9 m ) bands @xcite . such observations are also carried out toward comets , planets , and satellites like titan ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , ch@xmath5 is known as one of the major constituents of icy grain mantles in interstellar clouds .",
    "the infrared absorption of the @xmath8 ( @xmath12  @xmath9 m ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath13  @xmath9 m ) bands have been observed toward various sources including low - mass protostars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in spite of this progress , our understanding of the distribution and the abundance of ch@xmath5 in the gas phase is still limited particularly for cold interstellar medium including low - mass star - forming regions .",
    "this is because ch@xmath5 has no permanent dipole moment , and does not emit the pure rotational spectral lines which can readily be observed with radio telescopes .",
    "furthermore , the low - mass protostars are not bright enough for high - resolution infrared absorption spectroscopy .",
    "one practical way to overcome this situation is to observe its mono - deuterated species , ch@xmath1d , which emits the pure rotational spectral lines due to its small electric dipole moment ( 0.005657  d ) @xcite .",
    "however , the past efforts to detect the @xmath0 line ( 232.6  ghz ) of ch@xmath1d were not successful even toward orion - kl @xcite . since active high - mass star - forming regions contain many kinds of saturated complex organic molecules , their contamination make it difficult to detect the line . at that time",
    ", it was thought that detection of the ch@xmath1d line would be difficult in low - mass star - forming regions because of its relatively low column density in comparison with high - mass star - forming regions .",
    "recently , it was recognized that ch@xmath5 plays a crucial role in chemical processes occurring in low - mass star forming regions .",
    "sakai et al . ( 2008 ; 2009a ) found low - mass star - forming regions which harbor extremely rich carbon - chain molecules .",
    "they are l1527 in taurus and iras15398 - 3359 in lupus . according to the interferometric observation toward l1527 ,",
    "carbon - chain molecules and their related species show a steep increase in abundance inward of 5001000  au @xcite , where the gas kinetic temperature is higher than 20  k @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they reside even in the gas infalling to the protostar . in order to explain the observational results",
    ", it is proposed that carbon - chain molecules are regenerated near the protostar triggered by evaporation of the solid ch@xmath5 on dust grains ( warm carbon chain chemistry : wccc ) @xcite .",
    "the desorption temperature of ch@xmath5 is about 25  k @xcite , which is lower than that of h@xmath11o ( @xmath14  k ) .",
    "hence ch@xmath5 can be evaporated in a lukewarm region ( @xmath15  k ) around a newly born protostar . the ch@xmath5 evaporated from dust grains reacts with c@xmath16 to form c@xmath11h@xmath17 , which gives c@xmath11h@xmath11 and c@xmath11h by electron recombination reactions .",
    "further reactions of c@xmath11h@xmath11 and c@xmath11h with c@xmath16 produce longer carbon - chain molecules .",
    "a basic part of this scheme is confirmed by chemical model calculations @xcite .",
    "the wccc picture is consistent with the observed distribution of the carbon - chain molecules in l1527 @xcite .    because of a high expected abundance of ch@xmath5 ,",
    "the wccc sources would be a good target to search for the ch@xmath1d line .",
    "the molecular d / h ratios are measured to be consistent for various molecules toward l1527 @xcite , and hence , we can make a reasonable estimation for the abundance of gaseous ch@xmath5 from the observation of ch@xmath1d . the result will verify the wccc mechanism , and will lead us to a deeper understanding of a role of ch@xmath5 in interstellar chemistry . with this motivation , we conducted a sensitive observation of the ch@xmath1d line toward l1527 . +",
    "we first observed the @xmath0 line ( 232.644301  ghz ) of ch@xmath1d toward the low - mass protostar , iras 04368 + 2557 in l1527 with the iram 30 m telescope in april 2008 .",
    "the observed position was @xmath18 .",
    "we employed the a230/b230 receiver as a frontend .",
    "the beam size is 10.@xmath196 . in this observation",
    ", we found a hint of the ch@xmath1d line at the right @xmath20 velocity with the intensity of 20  mk ( @xmath21 ) , although the confidence level is only 2.3  @xmath22 .",
    "encouraged by this result , we then conducted a long integration observation of this line toward the same position with heinrich hertz submillimeter telescope ( hht ) in january 2011 and february 2012 . the alma band 6 ( @xmath23 )  mm prototype receiver was used as a frontend in the 4 if dual polarization mode , whose system noise temperatures ranged from 180  k to 250  k. in the observation in 2011 , the ch@xmath1d @xmath0 line was placed in the lower sideband with the cs @xmath24 line ( 244.9355565  ghz ) in the upper sideband .",
    "the sideband rejection was about -13  db .",
    "the beam size and the main beam efficiency of the telescope are listed in table [ tab : para ] . in the observation in 2012 ,",
    "the ch@xmath1d @xmath0 line was placed in the upper sideband with the c@xmath25o @xmath26 line ( 219.5603541  ghz ) in the lower sideband .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked every 1.5 hours by observing the continuum emission of jupiter , or the cs(@xmath24 ) emission of s231 and irc@xmath2710216 , and was maintained to be better than 10@xmath19 .",
    "a small daily variation of the intensity was calibrated by using the cs or c@xmath25o line .",
    "the backend used was filterbanks whose bandwidth and resolution are 64  mhz and 250  khz , respectively .",
    "the frequency resolution corresponds to the velocity resolution of 0.32  km s@xmath28 , which is comparable to or slightly smaller than the line width in this source ( 0.3 - 0.6  km s@xmath28 : sakai et al . 2008 ; 2009 ) .",
    "the observation was made in position - switching mode with the off - position of @xmath29  arcminutes .",
    "the final spectrum was placed on the @xmath21 scale using observations of jupiter .",
    "in the 2011 observation with hht , we tentatively detected the @xmath0 line of ch@xmath1d toward the low - mass protostar iras 04368 + 2557 in l1527 , as shown in figure  [ fig : ch3d ] .",
    "the line can be recognized in the both ( h and v ) polarization data , although it is marginally seen in the v polarization data due to a larger noise level .",
    "the line is not well resolved due to a limited frequency resolution of the backend employed . in preparation of the spectra , each 5  minute integration scan were carefully checked to eliminate the bad scan data with a heavy baseline distortion and/or an apparent strong noise spikes , as a usual data reduction process .",
    "note that no apparent spikes appear at the line channel . for the total spectrum ,",
    "the confidence level of the detection is 7.9  @xmath22 in the integrated intensity , and 5.2  @xmath22 in the peak intensity .",
    "this line shows the strongest intensity in the observed band ( 128 spectral channels ) , and the noise reveals a gaussian distribution , as shown in figure  [ fig : gau ] .",
    "hence , the line is significantly detected in the total spectrum .",
    "the noise distributions of the h and v polarization spectra are also shown in figures  [ fig : gau]b and [ fig : gau]c , respectively .",
    "they show the gaussian form , although the v polarization data have a slightly poor shape .",
    "to confirm the line , we also carried out the observation with the different frequency setting in 2012 , where the ch@xmath1d line is set in the upper sideband , and marginally confirmed the line with the 3.6  @xmath22 confidence level .",
    "however , we unfortunately suffered from serious spurious signals probably due to instability of the receiver and the backend in the 2012 observation in contrast to the 2011 observation , and hence , we did not use the 2012 data for the final spectrum .",
    "the linewidth and the lsr velocity are consistent with those of other carbon - chain molecules observed in this source ( e.g. sakai et al . 2008 ; 2009b ) .",
    "we carefully checked the molecular line databases such as cdms @xcite , jpl catalog @xcite , and confirmed that no appropriate line exists at the frequency of @xmath300.5  km s@xmath28 except for the ch@xmath1d line .",
    "we also confirmed no strong line in the image band .",
    "the lines of saturated complex organic molecules like hcooch@xmath1 , c@xmath11h@xmath31cn , and ( ch@xmath1)@xmath11o , which give congested spectra , are not detected in l1527 even with a very sensitive observation @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the high mass star - forming regions like orion kl , and also to the low - mass star - forming regions with the hot corino activity ( e.g. iras16293@xmath322422 ; cazaux et al .",
    "furthermore , the linewidth in l1527 is narrower than those in orion kl ( @xmath335  km s@xmath28 ) and iras16293@xmath322422 ( @xmath332  km s@xmath28 ) .",
    "although l1527 harbors long various carbon - chain molecules and their isomers , their rotational transitions in the 200  ghz region generally have very high upper state energies ( @xmath34100 cm@xmath28 , for carbon - chains with for or more carbon atoms ) and are difficult to be excited in l1527 .",
    "therefore , an accidental matching of other lines would be unlikely , and our identification of this line to ch@xmath1d is the most reasonable .",
    "the column density of ch@xmath1d is estimated to be @xmath2  @xmath3 from the integrated intensity by assuming the lte ( local thermodynamic equilibrium ) condition with the excitation temperature of 25  k , which corresponds to the evaporation temperature of ch@xmath5 from dust grains .",
    "the source size is assumed to be 20@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "here the error is calculated from three times the standard deviation of the integrated intensities .",
    "the fractional abundance of ch@xmath1d is evaluated to be @xmath4 , where the h@xmath11 column density is assumed to be @xmath36  @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "temperature dependences of the column density and the fractional abundance are carefully inspected , as summarized in table [ tab : column ] .",
    "the column density and the fractional abundance vary roughly linearly with the temperature over the range from 15 to 35  k. in this temperature range , the difference is within a factor of 2 .",
    "varies within a factor of 2 .",
    "the ch@xmath1d column density is much less than the upper limit reported for orion - kl ( @xmath37  @xmath3 ) by three orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "when we assume the deuterium fractionation ratio of 27  % by referring the ratios for various carbon - chain molecules observed toward l1527 @xcite , the ch@xmath5 column density is evaluated to be ( 1.34.6 ) @xmath38  @xmath3 by using the ch@xmath1d column density for the excitation temperature of 25  k. hence , the fractional abundance of ch@xmath5 is ( 4.315.2 ) @xmath39 . in this calculation",
    ", we do not explicitly consider the statistical factor due to four equivalent hydrogen atoms in ch@xmath5 , because the deuterium fractionation ratios observed in l1527 are within the above range regardless of the number of equivalent hydrogen atoms ( i.e. 0.05 , 0.03 , 0.07 , and 0.04 for l - c@xmath1d / l - c@xmath1h , c@xmath5hd / c@xmath5h@xmath11 , c - c@xmath1hd / c - c@xmath1h@xmath11 , and nh@xmath11d / nh@xmath1 , respectively ) .",
    "in this study , we tentatively detected the rotational spectral line of ch@xmath1d in interstellar space for the first time .",
    "although no cataloged lines do not match to the observed line , it might be a line of unknown species . to rule out this possibility completely ,",
    "we need to observe the other rotational transitions .",
    "the intensities of the @xmath40 ( 465  ghz ; @xmath41  k ) and @xmath42 ( 698  ghz ; @xmath43  k ) lines are predicted to be 21  mk and 12  mk by assuming the excitation temperature of 25 k and the linewidth of 0.5  km s@xmath28 .",
    "however , their sensitive observations are difficult because of the relatively heavy atmospheric absorption at these frequencies .",
    "we have therefore decided to publish the present result as the tentative detection of ch@xmath1d , considering its importance in astrochemistry .",
    "the gas - phase ch@xmath5 abundance has been reported for a few high - mass star - forming regions by observing the infrared absorption lines .",
    "lacy et al .",
    "( 1991 ) found that the gas - phase ch@xmath5 abundance is typically 10@xmath44 times the co abundance .",
    "if we assume the fractional abundance of co to be 10@xmath45 , this corresponds to the fractional abundance of 10@xmath46 . this value is lower than that observed in the present study by an order of magnitude . on the other hand , boogert et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reported the gas - phase ch@xmath5 abundance to be higher than @xmath47 toward the core of ngc7538  irs9 , and knez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) recently reported it to be @xmath48 toward ngc7538  irs1 .",
    "these abundances are comparable to our result , although their observation traces much hotter region ( @xmath49=55674  k ) than our present observation .",
    "according to the chemical model calculation of dynamically evolving cores by aikawa et al , ( 2008 ) , ch@xmath5 is mainly produced in grain mantles , and it is evaporated in a lukewarm region near the protostar . the gas - phase ch@xmath5 abundance in l1527 comparable to or slightly lower than that expected from their chemical model calculation ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the fractional abundance of ch@xmath1d is also comparable to or slightly lower than the result of their new chemical model calculation involving the deuterated species ( @xmath51 ) @xcite . if the emitting region of the ch@xmath1d line is smaller than 20@xmath19 , the abundance of ch@xmath1d becomes higher , giving a better agreement with the model result .    in this relation , it is interesting to compare our result with the solid ch@xmath5 abundance .",
    "the infrared absorption spectrum of solid ch@xmath5 is not available for l1527 , because the protostar is heavily obscured even in the mid - infrared region .",
    "however , it is detected in another wccc source , iras15398 - 3359 @xcite .",
    "the abundance of the solid ch@xmath5 relative to the h@xmath11o ice is reported to be 0.06 . when we assume the fractional abundance of the h@xmath11o ice relative to the gas - phase h@xmath11 to be 10@xmath45 , the fractional abundance of the solid ch@xmath5 is estimated to be @xmath52 .",
    "this is almost comparable to the gas - phase ch@xmath5 abundance found in l1527 .",
    "recent observational studies of low - mass star - forming regions reveal a significant chemical diversity among the low - mass class  0 protostars .",
    "two distinct cases are hot corinos and the wccc sources .",
    "the hot corino chemistry is characterized by rich saturated organic molecules like hcooch@xmath1 and ch@xmath1ch@xmath11cn , which are evaporated from grain mantles .",
    "the representative sources are iras 16293 - 2422 and ngc1333 iras4a / b ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these sources ,",
    "carbon - chain molecules are generally deficient .",
    "in contrast , the saturated organic molecules have not been detected so far in the wccc sources in spite of very sensitive single - dish observations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such a chemical variation originates from the difference in the evaporated species , and thereby in chemical composition of grain mantles . in the wccc mechanism ,",
    "the abundances of carbon - chain molecules critically depends on the amount of ch@xmath5 evaporated from grain mantles .",
    "if the gas - phase ch@xmath5 abundance is higher than the abundance of oh ( typically @xmath53 ; e.g. herbst and leung 1989 ) , ch@xmath5 can be a major destructor of c@xmath16 instead of oh in a lukewarm region where h@xmath11o is still frozen out .",
    "then , the wccc occurs when the ch@xmath5 abundance exceeds this level .",
    "the ch@xmath5 abundance derived for l1527 certainly fulfills this requirement , which further strengthens the wccc picture in l1527 .    in order to verify a role of ch@xmath5 in the observed chemical diversity ,",
    "it is important to measure the ch@xmath5 abundances in various low - mass star - forming regions . as demonstrated in this study",
    ", observations of ch@xmath1d can be a useful method for this purpose .",
