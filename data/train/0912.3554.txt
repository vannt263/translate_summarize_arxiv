    "the wolf - rayet ( wr ) star wr  147  is a massive binary system that is bright in x - rays and is a composite radio source . being the second closest wr star known allowed its emission to be spatially resolved in the radio , near infrared ( nir ) and optical .",
    "high - resolution radio observations showed that its southern component , wr  147s  ( the wn8 component in the binary ) , is a thermal source while its northern counterpart , wr  147n  , is a non - thermal source ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "high - resolution nir data revealed two sources separated by @xmath1 and wr  147n  was classified as a b0.5v star @xcite . an earlier spectral class , o8-o9 v - iii , was suggested from _ hubble space telescope _ observations which spatially resolved the binary components @xcite . at a distance of @xmath2  pc to wr  147  @xcite , the projected ( or minimum ) binary separation is @xmath3  au . since the binary components are massive stars , the interaction of their strong winds should form a colliding - stellar wind ( csw ) region ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , from the analysis of radio and ir images , @xcite concluded that the wr  147n  radio peak is displaced by @xmath4 southward from its ir counterpart .",
    "this value is within the uncertainties of the data but if it is real , the non - thermal radio source can be associated with the csw region located in vicinity of the ob companion .",
    "the csw scenario is supported by the analysis of the _ chandra _ high resolution camera ( hrc ) image ( although with a very limited photon statistics and having no spectral resolution ) which concluded that the x - ray emission is spatially extended and it peaks north of the wn8 star although a deeper x - ray image is needed to accurately determine the degree of spatial extension @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that contribution from the massive stars in the binary can not be excluded since these objects are x - ray sources themselves ( e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "x - ray observations are very important for studying csws . they provide us with direct information about the physical conditions in the hot plasma behind strong shocks , which are likely the place where non - thermal radio emission forms . the earlier x - ray observations of wr  147  have revealed the presence of thermal emission from high temperature plasma ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but the csw plasma characteristics were more tightly constrained only from the higher signal - to - noise _ xmm - newton _",
    "data @xcite .",
    "skinner et al . reported a detection of the fe k@xmath0 complex at 6.67  kev and their analysis showed that the plasma temperature is higher than the maximum temperature in the colliding - wind shock .",
    "consequently , @xcite modeled the _ xmm - newton _ spectra successfully in the framework of the csw scenario but only at the requirement the stellar wind velocities were by a factor of @xmath5 higher than their currently accepted values .",
    "the fact that wr  147  is a wide binary at a relatively small distance gives us an opportunity to examine the csw phenomenon in more detail that is to carry on spatially resolved x - ray studies .",
    "this motivated our deep observations with the _ chandra _ high energy transmission gratings ( hetg ) . in this _",
    "letter _ we report the first part of our analysis ( based on the zeroth order data ) which reveals a double x - ray source in wr  147  .",
    "wr  147  was observed with _",
    "chandra _ in the period mar 28 - apr 10 , 2009 .",
    "the observations in configuration hetg - acis - s were carried out in eight occasions ( ) that provided 7,300 zeroth order counts in a total effective exposure of 286 ksec .",
    "the ciao 4.1.2 data analysis software was used through this study in combination with the _ chandra _ calibration database caldb v.4.1.3 . following the ciao science threads , the original or combined event files were used for determining the source coordinates , source variability and spectral extractions . by default",
    ", the pixel randomization is switched off in grating data .",
    "to have a full advantage of the total source counts in our analysis of the zeroth order data , it is necessary to combine all data sets . as a prerequisite to this process , it is important to estimate the accuracy of the source coordinates in the resultant total image .",
    "this was done in two steps .",
    "first , the ciao command _ wavdetect _ was run on each of the eight observations and an average position of the source was calculated .",
    "the errors of the mean were propagated from the individual errors derived from _",
    "wavdetect_. second , all the zeroth order data were merged eight times ( ciao command _ merge_all _ ) with a different reference image .",
    "the source coordinates were determined for each merged image by running _",
    "wavdetect_. the maximum difference in the source coordinates from one merged image to another was @xmath6 and @xmath7 , correspondingly for the right ascension and declination .",
    "the source positions are given in table  [ tab : coor ] .",
    "we note that the center of the source in the merged data is practically the same as the one determined from averaging coordinates of the source centers derived for each individual observation .",
    "all this makes us confident that our analysis is not influenced by the choice of the reference image .",
    "the derived x - ray coordinates of wr  147  are in good agreement ( within the @xmath8 of the _ chandra _ positional accuracy ) with the ones determined for this object in the optical ( _ hst _ guide star catalog ) and in the radio ( table  [ tab : coor ] ) .      the considerably better photon statistics ( 7,300 cts ) of the total zeroth order hetg image",
    "compared to that of the previous _ chandra _ hrc image ( @xmath9  cts , @xcite ) gave us an opportunity to study in detail the spatial extent of the x - ray emission from this object .",
    "it also allowed us to carry on image analysis in different photon energy bands .",
    "the relatively small spatial scale of the wr  147  emission in the radio and optical ( @xmath10 which corresponds to @xmath11 acis pixels ) prompted the use of subpixel images and image deconvolution techniques .",
    "we applied a deconvolution procedure , based on a maximum likelihood method ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , that was successfully used in the image analysis of snr  1987a , an object with a small spatial extent of @xmath12 ( @xcite ; @xcite , 2004 , 2006 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the main result is that the morphology of the x - ray emission of wr  147   changes in different energy bands : its northern part is brightest in the ( 1.0 - 2.0 kev ) range and gradually weakens at higher energies .",
    "this likely indicates that a soft x - ray source is located there while most of the hard energy photons originate in the southern part of wr  147  .",
    "this pattern is clearly seen from the raw subpixel x - ray images as well as from the deconvolved ones ( fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) and is also illustrated by the sources relative brightness derived from direct photon counting ( see lower right panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "it is thus conclusive that wr  147  is a _",
    "double _ x - ray source , consisting of a northern ( wr  147n  ) and a southern ( wr  147s  ) part with different spectral characteristics . a separation of @xmath13 between the positions of maximum emission of wr  147n  and wr  147s  is directly measured from the deconvolved ( 1.0 - 2.0 kev ) image .",
    "the existence of a spatial separation between wr  147n  and wr  147s  gets additional support from measuring the wr  147  coordinates in different energy bands .",
    "we ran the ciao command _ wavdetect _ on the eight merged images .",
    "we see that there is an offset of @xmath14 between the source coordinates in the soft ( 1.0 - 2.0 kev ) and hard ( 6.0 - 8.0 kev ) energy bands ( table  [ tab : coor ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the source coordinates in the latter almost perfectly coincide with the ones in the optical and radio .",
    "it is thus conclusive that the x - ray hard - photon emitter ( wr  147s  ) is in fact the wr star itself ( a wn8 object ) .",
    "furthermore , a direct comparison of the wr  147  images in the radio and x - rays reveals a nice correspondence between the locations of the radio and x - ray wr  147n  sources ( fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) which is suggestive that this is the csw region in this binary system .",
    "guided by the results from the image analysis , we extracted the x - ray spectra of wr  147  , wr  147n  and wr  147s  from the total ( merged ) zeroth order data by using the ciao script _",
    "specextract _ ( for extraction regions see fig .  [",
    "fig : extract ] ) .",
    "we fitted the spectra with standard as well as custom models in version 11.3.2 of xspec @xcite .",
    "we note that due to the small spatial separation between wr  147n  and wr  147s  their spectra are not completely disentangled from each other . in our upcoming analysis of the first - order data",
    ", we will consider a more elaborated modeling of the undispersed spectra in conjunction with the dispersed ones .",
    "we adopted a simpler approach here which is nevertheless instructive for the emerging physical picture .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , the total spectrum of wr  147  is very similar to that obtained with _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite : it is heavily absorbed , having most of its x - ray counts at energies e  @xmath15  kev .",
    "for consistency with the previous studies , we adopted the same set of wn abundances ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) . a simple 1 t shock model ( _ vpshock _ in xspec ) gave a similar quality of the fit as for the _ xmm - newton _ spectra of wr  147  .",
    "the x - ray absorption and the plasma temperature ( with 90% confidence intervals in brackets ) were n@xmath16\\times10^{22}$ ]  @xmath17 , kt  @xmath18 $ ]  kev , and the derived abundances fell within the 90% confidence intervals of the _ xmm - newton _ spectral fits @xcite .",
    "the total observed flux was f@xmath19  erg  s@xmath20 , about 15% smaller than that from the _ xmm - newton _ spectra .",
    "a better constraint on this difference would be possible after completing upcoming analysis of the first - order hetg data .",
    "exploring the physical picture that identifies wr  147n  with the csw region in the binary system , the x - ray spectra of wr  147n  and wr  147s  were fitted simultaneously and they shared the same wn abundances set .",
    "the latter is justified by that the shocked wn wind dominates the x - ray emission of the csw region ( @xcite ; for the use of discrete temperature models see   5.2 therein ) . the 1 t shock model with individual postshock temperatures for wr  147n  and wr  147s  and a common x - ray absorption gave a poor quality of the fit ( reduced @xmath21 ) .",
    "an acceptable fit was obtained if the spectra had individual x - ray absorption ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra ] and table  [ tab : fits ] ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that in both sources the plasma temperature well exceeds 1 kev .",
    "as in the image analysis , we see that the northern source is softer than its southern counterpart . also , the latter ( the wn8 star ) is the place where the fe k@xmath0 complex at 6.67  kev comes from ( see the inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "wr  147s  is subject to an excess x - ray absorption compared to wr  147n  . applying the @xcite conversion ( nh @xmath22a@xmath23  @xmath17 )",
    ", the absorption towards wr  147n  almost perfectly corresponds to the optical extinction of wr  147  ( a@xmath24  mag , a@xmath25  a@xmath26 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we thus note that the results from image and spectral analysis seem consistent with a physical picture where wr  147n  resides in the csw region of the binary , while the x - ray source wr  147s  is likely located deeper in the wr wind .",
    "we used version 4.4 of the marx software to simulate the observational situation with wr  147  .",
    "we ran a 286-ksec hetg exposure for a x - ray source composed of two point sources with spectral characteristics corresponding to those of wr  147n  and wr  147s  ( table  [ tab : fits ] ) .",
    "the sources were located at the positions of maximum emission for the northern and southern sources as in the ( 1.0 - 2.0 kev ) deconvolved image of wr  147  .",
    "we note a nice correspondence between the simulated and observed data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) .",
    "all this makes us more confident about the results from our analysis , that illustrate the superior capabilities of the _ chandra _ observatory even when working on their very edge .",
    "analysis of the zeroth order hetg data showed that _",
    "chandra _ resolved wr  147  into a double x - ray source .",
    "its two counterparts , wr  147n  and wr  147s  , are most likely identified correspondingly with the csw region and the wn8 star in this wide binary system .",
    "we recall that the maximum temperature in the csw region is determined by the terminal wind velocities in the binary and for wr  147  their currently accepted values could not provide the plasma temperature deduced from the x - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "this is why , successful csw models of wr  147  were possible only for wind velocities being a factor of @xmath27 higher @xcite .",
    "we note that all this is based on analysis of the unresolved _ xmm - newton _ data which assumed that the csw region is responsible for the _ total _ x - ray emission from wr  147  . the high resolution _",
    "data resolve this discrepancy by revealing two sources with different spectral characteristics .",
    "we used the csw model with the nominal stellar wind parameters ( v@xmath28  km  s@xmath20 , @xmath29 m@xmath30  yr@xmath20 ; v@xmath31  km  s@xmath20 , @xmath32 m@xmath30  yr@xmath20 ; @xmath33 = 0.028 $ ] ; for csw model details see @xcite ) to fit the x - ray spectrum of wr  147n  .",
    "as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , the shape of the observed spectrum is perfectly matched , that is there is no temperature discrepancy between the model and observations any more .",
    "but , the model overestimates the total luminosity of wr  147n  by a factor of @xmath34 .",
    "we note that this discrepancy is in general trackable .",
    "the csw x - ray luminosity scales with the mass loss rate @xmath35 , wind velocity @xmath36 and binary separation as @xmath37 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the mass - loss rates are factor of @xmath38 or even more lower than assumed because of their intrinsic uncertainties or because the winds are clumped ( e.g. @xcite ) , this can account for most of the luminosity mismatch , and the unknown orbital inclination ( larger binary separation ) would account for the difference . all this will be explored in detail in our upcoming combined modeling of the first - order spectra and the undisperesed ones .    while this gives more confidence that wr  147n  resides in the csw region of the binary system , an identification of wr  147n  with the ob star in the system can not be completely ruled out .",
    "our analysis of the x - ray spectral lines ( from the first - order hetg spectra ) will be crucial in this respect .",
    "for example , if suppressed forbidden line in the he - like triplets is found ( an indication of high density or strong uv emission ) , it will favor the ob star origin for wr  147n  . unfortunately , the luminosity of the ob companion is poorly constrained @xcite which prevents estimating its contribution to the x - ray emission of wr  147n  based on the l@xmath39 - l@xmath40 relation .",
    "but , the ob stars are in general soft x - ray sources with plasma temperatures less than 1 kev ( see  4.1.2 and  4.3 in the review paper of @xcite ) . given the high x - ray absorption to wr  147  (   [ subsec : spectra ] ) , we thus anticipate that this contribution will not be appreciable unless the ob star in wr  147  is a rare hot magnetic object ( see  4.6 in @xcite ) .    on the other hand , the fact that the wn8 star is a hard - energy x - ray source ( wr  147s  ) is indeed puzzling .",
    "skinner et al . ( 2002a , b ) have discussed in some detail possible mechanisms for x - ray production in wn stars when the high - energy tail was established with certainty in the x - ray emission from presumably single wr stars : wr 6 and wr 110 .",
    "these mechanisms include : instability - driven wind shocks ( idws ) ; magnetically confined wind shocks ( mcws ) ; wind accretion shocks ; colliding wind shocks ( including the case of stellar wind shocking onto a close companion ) ; non - thermal x - ray emission .",
    "we note that none of these mechanisms finds solid observational support for the moment and each of them has its own limitations and caveats .",
    "for example , the idws should be considerably soft x - ray emitters while the mcws might be able to provide the high plasma temperature observed in wr  147s  .",
    "but for the massive stellar winds in wrs , this requires a relatively strong global magnetic field in the star itself . at present ,",
    "such fields have not been reported for wolf - rayet stars .",
    "presence of a strong magnetic field may also suggest flare activity but no short - term variability is detected in any of the eight hetg observations ( the ciao tool _ glvary _",
    "returns a variability index of zero ) .",
    "the same was found in earlier x - ray observations of wr  147  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "presence of a compact ( or a normal star ) companion is intriguing but this may suggest that we have quite a rare opportunity to observe a triple system that initially consisted of at least two or even three massive stars and in the latter case the most massive one has already exploded .    finally , although the mechanism responsible for the high - energy x - ray production is unclear it may not be unique to wr  147  .",
    "apart from earlier detections ( wr 6 and wr 110 ) , @xcite report a hard - energy tail in the x - ray spectra of several more , presumably single , wn stars .",
    "it is worth noting that all these wns have a subtype different from wr  147  while a star of its subtype , wr 40 ( a wn8 star ) , was not detected with _",
    "xmm - newton _ @xcite .",
    "hopefully , future observations will facilitate solving the mystery of this puzzling phenomenon : how common the high - energy tail is for single wr stars and how it correlates with their subtype .",
    "but , wr  147  is unique in the sense that for the first time we detect x - rays _ directly _ from a wr star in a binary system .",
    "moreover , the upcoming analysis of the first - order hetg spectra will give us a chance to measure line parameters ( widths , centroids , fluxes ) in the x - ray spectrum _",
    "intrinsic _ to a wr star ( wr  147s  ) , thus , to study its x - ray plasma characteristics in detail .        abbott d.c .",
