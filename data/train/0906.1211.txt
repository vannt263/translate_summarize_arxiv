    "ultraviolet observations with the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that @xmath19 of nearby disk galaxies host star formation in an extended component @xcite .",
    "these stellar disks sometimes reach to more than twice the optical radius ( @xmath3 ) and challenge our understanding of disk galaxies . motivated by a lack of understanding and because progress here may pose additional challenges for galaxy formation models , we begin a systematic investigation of a sample of nine nearby galaxy outer disks using deep optical imaging and present first results here .",
    "although deep h@xmath14 and broadband optical observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) had previously detected star formation in outer disks , the ubiquity , and therefore the significance , of this component has been largely overlooked until recently .",
    "the traditional tracer of very young star clusters and ongoing star formation , h@xmath14 flux , is emitted by gas surrounding a cluster for a short period of time ( @xmath20 myr , or about the lifetime of massive ob stars ) .",
    "consequently , the number of h@xmath14 detections is modest @xcite .",
    "the two most prominent extended disks studied with galex so far , m83 and ngc 4625 @xcite , have nearby companions , suggesting that gravitational interactions may be responsible for their extended outer disks .",
    "a more comprehensive galex study @xcite does contain isolated galaxies , but typically they are more distant ( the majority of galaxies in the galex atlas sample are @xmath21 mpc away ) and so only the brightest end of the knot luminosity function is sampled . to address these shortcomings",
    ", we select nearby , isolated galaxies , observe them sufficiently deeply to probe the knot luminosity function well and obtain numerous candidate knots , and develop a method to quantify the nature of the knot spatial distribution .    in complement to the imaging studies , @xcite",
    "have shown that deep longslit spectroscopy can provide a measure of both the integrated extent and global disk - plane kinematics ( i.e.  rotation curves ) of outer disks in edge - on galaxies .",
    "while spectroscopy provides useful information , it is generally limited to knots emitting h@xmath14 .",
    "to expand the lookback time over which we can study disks , we image at redder colors to identify older candidate knots , but the drawback of this approach is that discrimination with background sources becomes more challenging .",
    "because we use optical observations to search for outer disk knots analogous to those detected by galex , we note the differences between the two sets of data .",
    "first , galex s spatial resolution ( @xmath22 fwhm ) is roughly six times larger than what we typically achieve . at the distance of ngc 3184",
    ", galex s resolution element corresponds to a physical scale of @xmath23 pc , compared to the @xmath24 pc of our ground - based data .",
    "galex knots are typically blends of multiple clusters @xcite , whereas ( as we will show ) , we detect knots resembling individual star clusters .",
    "second , galex observations are sensitive mainly to young clusters ( @xmath25 myr ; * ? ? ? * ) whereas we are sensitive to clusters with ages up to several gigayears . finally , our mass limit is lower by a factor of 10 .",
    "our lbt data will therefore provide larger numbers of knots to use in any statistical measure of the disk .",
    "we present the initial results of a statistical study of nearby ( @xmath26 mpc ) outer disks , using the 8.4 m large binocular telescope ( lbt , mt .  graham , arizona ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and wide - field , prime - focus large binocular cameras ( lbc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we describe our data reduction , develop analysis tools , and apply these to deep @xmath1-band and @xmath2-band ( hereafter @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) imaging data of the nearly face - on ( inclination @xmath27 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spiral galaxy ngc 3184 ( @xmath4 mpc , or @xmath28 mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "ngc 3184 is similar to an @xmath29 * galaxy , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate how two separate statistical methods enable us to trace outer disk cluster - like objects to large radii . because the distance to ngc 3184 is uncertain at the @xmath32 level ( @xmath33 mpc ) , all scales referenced to the frame of the disk are also uncertain at the @xmath32 level .",
    "this uncertainty in distance does not significantly affect our results .",
    "the detected correlation signals are independent of the physical size of the field .",
    "we address the following questions here : 1 ) in a non - interacting galaxy , without an obvious population of galex knots , do we detect any evidence of an extended disk ?",
    "2 ) if so , what are the oldest clusters we detect ?",
    "3 ) how can we detect an older population of knots that is less distinct from the background galaxy population ?",
    "4 ) how does the extent of the disk compare to the fuel source ( i.e.  the gas ) .",
    "in  2 we describe our observations , data reductions and source detections . in ",
    "3 we present color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of candidate outer disk sources and the range of cluster properties consistent with the candidate knots . we also present an estimate of disk knot radial extent determined from the cmds in  3 . in ",
    "4 we present a restricted three - point correlation analysis that increases contrast with the background and more effectively probes the extent of clustered outer disk objects . in  5 we present a similar clustering analysis using galex uv sources , and in  6 we present a comparison to the underlying neutral gas profile , using 21 cm vla data with a @xmath34 detection limit of @xmath35 . in ",
    "7 we discuss the local environment of ngc 3184 .",
    "we present a summary of our results and a brief discussion in  8 .",
    "we observed ngc 3184 with lbc - blue on the lbt during science demonstration time on march 20 , 2007 .",
    "we obtained eight and nine dithered , 164-second exposures through the @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters , respectively , under non - photometric conditions and @xmath36 seeing , and obtained single 164-second photometric exposures ( in @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) on february 2 , 2008 , together with three photometric landolt standard star fields @xcite for flux calibration .",
    "the photometric exposures served their purpose but due to poor image quality we exclude them from the final science mosaics .",
    "we correct for both global changes and the two - dimensional structure in the bias using a set of interactive data language ( idl ) scripts created by our group .",
    "the lbc - blue detector array consists of four 2k x 4k ccd chips ( each with a gain of @xmath37 electrons / adu , read noise of @xmath38 electrons and @xmath39-wide pixels ) , three aligned side - by - side lengthwise and one centered perpendicularly above them .",
    "we begin by correcting for bias gradients along columns ( spanning the long axis ) in the bias frames .",
    "the median within the overscan region along each row is subtracted from that row .",
    "the overscan - corrected bias frames of each chip are then median combined after removing 1@xmath40 outliers , where @xmath40 is calculated excluding the minimum and maximum values in the stack ( 15 frames / stack were used ) .",
    "we adopt an aggressive clipping ( 1@xmath40 ) to ensure that deviant values , which artificially increase the calculated rms value , are excluded .",
    "the result is our final ` master bias ' frames used to subtract any residual structure in an image after the overscan levels are accounted for .",
    "we bias - correct all raw frames in this manner and trim the overscan regions .    to correct for sensitivity variations on the ccds ,",
    "we combine dithered , twilight - sky flat - field images ( 10 in each band ) .",
    "we calculate the four - chip median value of each bias - corrected flat field exposure and divide each chip of the particular four by this median level to normalize the flat .",
    "optical distortions in lbc - blue can result in non - flat images ( a @xmath41 effect across the field of view ) .",
    "we correct for this effect later using the distortion maps created by scamp @xcite when aligning our individual images to a common field of view ( see below ) .",
    "the normalized flats are then median combined after minimum / maximum and @xmath42 rejection as above , producing our ` master flat ' for each chip .",
    "we complete our processing by dividing the bias - corrected science frames by the master flats , resulting in @xmath1 images flat to @xmath43 and @xmath2 images flat to @xmath44 .",
    "we next subtract the background level . estimating the true background is made difficult by contaminating scattered light that varies sensitively with the telescope orientation , and by the extended galaxy that covers a large portion of the field in each exposure . to minimize the effects of these contaminants , we determine the background level in twenty @xmath45 pixel regions distributed near the edges of the detector array using the idl routine mmm , which estimates the sky background in a stellar contaminated field by assuming that contaminated sky pixel values overwhelmingly display positive departures from the true value .",
    "we then adopt the minimum background value from the regions on each chip and subtract it from that particular chip .",
    "this process is done separately for each exposure .    to create combined images free of spurious signal or cosmetic defects",
    ", we create masks of bad columns and hot pixels for each chip interactively ( based on obvious defects in the flats ) and invert the masks to create the weightmaps used in the combining process .",
    "next , we reject cosmic ray detections with the idlutils routine reject_cr ( written by m.  blanton ) , which rejects cosmic rays by finding features sharper than the point spread function ( psf ) at @xmath46 above the background .",
    "the identified cosmic ray pixels are incorporated into the bad pixel masks .",
    "we produce our final mosaics using scamp and swarp .",
    "scamp solves the astrometry of the dithered exposures , and requires that we first create catalogs of detected sources in each exposure . to create the necessary catalogs for scamp , we use sextractor @xcite , restricting source detection to objects with five or more adjacent pixels for which the pixel values are at least 8@xmath40 above sky in @xmath1 and 3@xmath40 above sky in @xmath2 .",
    "we exclude pixels with values above 40,000 adu when running sextractor because these pixels produced false detections ( @xmath47 adu is the raw saturation level of the ccds ) .",
    "we find that the above choices result in the best distortion maps from scamp ( maps whose distortion level contours trace smoothly across the chip gaps ) , using three scamp iterations with tightening criteria for source matching .",
    "we use the sdss fifth data release ( dr5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as the reference catalog to match sources in the ngc 3184 field .",
    "scamp provides the wcs solutions used for combining the frames with swarp .",
    "we set the ` expotime_key ' parameter in scamp to ` dontuse ' , so that the resulting fluxes are not altered by the image exposure times ( we normalize the photometry to a fixed second@xmath48 standard after combining the images with swarp , when calibrating the science images to the standard star images ) .",
    "scamp is used to create the distortion maps that correct for the optical concentration effect mentioned earlier , so that the images are on the same @xmath39 pixel@xmath48 spatial scale before being combined into a mosaic .",
    "the final step is to create the deep mosaics we use for source detection , calibration and analysis .",
    "we pass the output headers from scamp containing the wcs solutions of each exposure to swarp , which we set to combine the spatially - aligned frames to their average values after accounting for the bad pixel masks .",
    "total integration times in the deepest regions of the resulting mosaics are @xmath49 and @xmath50 minutes in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we build final @xmath1 and @xmath2 aperture photometry catalogs using sextractor , with source detection and aperture placement based on the deeper @xmath1-band mosaic ( both mosaics have the same @xmath36 psf , and similar image quality ) .",
    "after trying various combinations of parameters , we select sources by identifying groups of five or more pixels each with flux @xmath51 above the background ( so typical ` detections ' are actually @xmath52 , because @xmath53^{[\\geq5 ] } < 0.0032 $ ] ) . for our parameter choices",
    ", we set the saturation level to be 55,000 counts to conservatively avoid problematic saturated areas ( we are less concerned with false detections in the mosaic , particularly with the fine - tuned settings listed below ) , a seeing fwhm of @xmath54 , a pixel scale of @xmath55 , local background calculation , the background manually set as 0.0 because we have already subtracted it ( note that the photometry uses the local background , however ) , a 3x3-pixel ` all - ground ' convolution mask with fwhm=2 pixels for filtering to avoid spurious detections of noise peaks , a minimum contrast deblending parameter of 0.001 , a ` cleaning ' of the catalog with an efficiency parameter of 1 , a background mesh size of 32 pixels , and a background - filtering mask size of 3 background meshes .",
    "using the same sextractor parameters , we then perform matched - aperture photometry on the @xmath2 image .",
    "a visual inspection of the detected sources confirms that the above parameters lead sextractor to detect nearly all visually - discernable objects in the region of interest , beyond the optical radius @xmath3 .",
    "our catalog becomes noticeably incomplete below @xmath56 , where sextractor has difficulty detecting unique sources over the extended , bright emission of the inner disk .",
    "given the distance of ngc 3184 ( 11.1 mpc , or @xmath28 mag ) , our @xmath54 seeing ( @xmath24 pc at the distance of ngc 3184 ) , and that all but the brightest ob stars would fall below our detection limit ( @xmath0 mag .",
    "for the bluest sources ) , the candidate outer disk objects are likely to be groupings of stars . because we detect the integrated light from members of stellar groups , or knots ( see figure  [ knots_fig ] for examples ) , any photometric algorithm that requires a uniform object shape for extraction is not optimal for this work .",

    "[ knots_fig],width=336 ]      we calibrate our photometry using photometric exposures of landolt standard star fields , taken on the same night as our individual photometric exposures of ngc 3184 , to flux - calibrate the observed standard star signal for a range of airmasses and colors .",
    "we then place the photometry of eight isolated stars in the photometric frame of ngc 3184 on the standard vega system , accounting for the calculated airmass and color terms as well as the different exposure times , and finally bootstrap the photometry of the deep mosaic using these same stars .",
    "colors and magnitudes are measured using circular apertures .",
    "colors quoted throughout are from fixed four - pixel - diameter apertures ( @xmath57 or @xmath58 pc at ngc 3184 , just larger than the typical @xmath54 fwhm of detected sources ) , while @xmath1 magnitudes are from 10-pixel - diameter apertures ( @xmath59 or @xmath60 pc at ngc 3184 ) and aperture - corrected using stellar curves - of - growth by @xmath61 mag .",
    "aperture corrections were calculated from eight isolated , unsaturated stars measured in 15 apertures spanning @xmath62 pixels in diameter ( or @xmath63 ) . to the degree the knots are resolved , our aperture corrections will underestimate the total flux .",
    "we choose the 10-pixel - diameter apertures so as to include the bulk flux from the many marginally - resolved extended sources visible in the images while not including too many neighbors ( see figure  [ knots_fig ] ; false - color composite images are available from the electronic version of the paper ) .",
    "we set sextractor to mask and correct neighbors that contaminate .    in our final catalog ,",
    "we only include sources whose @xmath64 color error is @xmath65 mag ( magnitude errors are provided by sextractor and propagated in the standard manner ) .",

    "the scaled tracks are meant as a general guide only ; the stochastic sampling of the imf at low cluster masses @xcite is not accounted for in the following knot mass and age estimates .",
    "the uncertainties from the stochastic sampling are larger for the lower - mass and younger clusters , and a scaled - down model cluster track ( from a well - sampled imf ) becomes systematically brighter and bluer than real clusters would be at a particular age ( the tracks represent contributions from the highest - mass stars , which are increasingly unlikely to be found in real low - mass clusters ) . as a result , comparisons with the scaled model tracks can lead to underestimates of cluster masses and overestimates of their ages .",

    "the strength of the signal fades quickly with radius , and the right panel of figure  [ hess_2panel ] suggests that @xmath9 is the limit of how far this method can probe the outer disk .",
    "although outer disk knots are typically thought of as being young because they were discovered in the uv , we find that the population of knots redward of @xmath82 dominates that of bluer ones .",
    "the younger , blue population of knots is only detected near the optical radius with this method . however , we can not distinguish between dust and age as the primary driver of color ; we assume insignificant reddening of the majority of outer disk sources , but caution that the relative numbers of young vs.  old knots is uncertain because of this issue .    in figure  [ colmag ] a @xmath74 model star cluster track for ages between 100 myr and 1",

    "the number of objects falls off rapidly , implying that whatever outer disk objects are in this sample , the majority have masses @xmath83 .",
    "our catalog becomes incomplete for objects resembling @xmath74 clusters older than @xmath8 gyr , and the age where this incompleteness sets in decreases quickly with decreasing cluster mass .",
    "a @xmath84 track suggests that at the low - mass end our final catalog is restricted to objects younger than a few tens of myr , although this estimate is more uncertain due to the previously - discussed stochastic sampling of the imf . because one massive o - star forms per @xmath85 of stars in a cluster ( *",
    "* and references therein ) , many outer disk clusters detected here may host only a few o - stars , and many may contain none at all .    although not well - constrained with the available optical data ( i.e.  @xmath1 & @xmath2 only ) , our estimated cluster mass range ( @xmath7 ) matches that found in the extended disk of ngc 4625 ( see * ? ? ? * their figure 4 ) .",
    "those authors examined galex fuv - selected complexes in the outer disk of ngc 4625 that also show corresponding h@xmath14 emission , and found that the majority of detected knots ( or clusters ) lie between @xmath86 , with the lowest - mass knots resembling @xmath87 clusters .",

    "* ) , similar to what we expect to find in our images of the outer disk of ngc 3184 .",
    "the distinction between our data and those from galex is that we have superior spatial resolution and in principle can find older clusters .",
    "the strength of the galex data relative to ours is that the young clusters are more prominent relative to background sources .",
    "another way to estimate the outer disk extent is to consider the spatial distribution of knots most likely associated with ngc 3184 .",
    "here we present correlation functions to trace the self - clustering of knots in the outer disk . to maximize whatever correlation signal exists , we must increase the contrast between the sources of interest and the background . in the fuv and nuv bands of the galex images ,",
    "the blue star - forming knots stand out sharply against the redder background galaxies .",
    "@xcite exploited this color contrast in the galex data and calculated the two - point correlation function of detected sources around nearby galaxies , to quantify the ubiquity of any extended disk component .",
    "their main result was that five of the eleven galaxies studied show an excess of sources between @xmath91 , which statistically implies that at least a quarter of such galaxies have an extended blue knot population .",
    "we would like to use a statistical method similar to the two - point correlation analysis of @xcite to measure the extent of ngc 3184 s outer disk with our lbt data .",
    "the two - point correlation approach would work well here if ngc 3184 had large numbers of blue knots in its outer disk , because they would create the sharp color and number density contrast required to isolate them from the background . due to the lack of blue outer disk sources , and",
    "that the dominant red sources have similar @xmath64 colors to the background objects ( figures  [ colmag ] & [ hess_2panel ] ) , the @xcite approach is not effective with our optical data .",
    "note that a particular red color cut _ can _ be applied to provide enough contrast for a significant two - point correlation function to be made in the inner disk , but this correlation quickly becomes insignificant beyond @xmath3 .",
    "we must find another way to accentuate the contrast between knots and the background and thereby maximize whatever two - point correlation function signal may exist in the outer disk . as evident in figure",
    "[ knots_fig ] , the knots cluster about themselves .",
    "we use this self - clustering of knots as a means to provide the necessary contrast with the background ; we assume that the background sources ( mostly galaxies ) do not cluster on scales similar to the disk objects .",
    "we then ask , ` how far can we trace clustered knots ? '    to measure the clustering of knots as a function of galactocentric distance , we calculate a ` restricted ' three - point correlation , for which one of the 3 points is always defined to be the center of the galaxy .",
    "we begin by selecting sources by color and magnitude to have rough mass and age constraints .",
    "we then calculate the two - point knot - knot correlation at each radius .",
    "specifically , for each knot we calculate the distance to neighboring knots ( @xmath92 - see figure  [ radii_expl ] ) , bin the distribution of distances , and obtain an estimate of the two - point knot - knot correlation function at the galactocentric radius @xmath93 of this individual knot .",
    "we repeat this process for every knot and bin in @xmath93 to obtain the raw version of the restricted three - point correlation map .    , width=192 ]    the raw restricted three - point correlation map must be corrected for several effects . because we are attempting to isolate the self - clustering signal of disk - only knots as a function of radius , we must first account for contaminating correlation signal in the raw map arising from the given distribution of knots in the field at all @xmath93 ( both disk and background sources ) , as well as for contaminating signal from any spatially - correlated background galaxies .",
    "first , we normalize the two - point correlation function at each @xmath93 by dividing by the number of knots at that radius , divide by the background number density of sources calculated in an annulus at large @xmath93 , and subtract 1 from the result so that the ` unclustered ' signal is zero .",
    "second , we correct for the underlying ` self - correlation ' of knots across the field via monte - carlo simulations .",
    "self - correlation arises because the knots are correlated with the galaxy , and so will appear correlated with each other even if the outer disk has absolutely no intrinsic clustering . to calculate and subtract this we generate 500 three - point correlation maps , similar to the original but each time randomizing the knots in angle about the galactic center .",
    "this approach preserves the source density gradient with @xmath93 ( which we do not wish to remove ) while providing a measure of the self - correlation of a disk with no knot clustering . subtracting the average of these 500 realizations then provides a measure of the intrinsic knot clustering .",
    "lastly , we use the two - point correlation function at large @xmath93 to subtract the underlying galaxy - galaxy correlation function ( i.e. the apparent clustering of background galaxies ) .",
    "if there were no outer disks knots , then the correlation function along @xmath92 would simply be the galaxy - galaxy correlation function and be independent of @xmath93 . by subtracting the @xmath92 correlation as measured at large @xmath93 ( beyond @xmath94 ) , where there presumably are no outer disk knots , we have removed the effect of contaminating galaxies .",
    "the average amplitude of the random ` self - clustering ' correction ( due to the distribution of all sources in the field ) is equal to the average amplitude of the raw correlation signal at large @xmath92 ( @xmath95 kpc ) , indicating that the knots are not self - clustered on large scales .",
    "the average amplitude of the background galaxy - galaxy correction is thus also similar to the random - self - clustering - corrected signal at large @xmath92 , because the signal now remaining in these regions is due only to background galaxy - galaxy clustering . at smaller @xmath92 , particularly where we detect statistically - significant signal in the final map ( described below ) ,",
    "the amplitude of this galaxy - galaxy correction is negligible compared to the signal remaining from disk objects .",
    "we use the scatter from the random realizations to set the significance level of positive excursions in the correlation map .",
    "taking the scatter from a ` background ' region of the random maps is insufficient , however .",
    "due to the source distribution in the field and the different annuli area used in constructing the maps , the scatter is not uniform . from our 500 realizations we identify excursions that have only a 5% or 1% chance of occurring at that particular @xmath93 , @xmath92 combination .",
    "filled contours connecting these @xmath93 , @xmath92 ` pixel ' excursion values define the two - dimensional 95% and 99% significance thresholds in the map .",
    "the resulting background of noise peaks in the map ( on scales of the @xmath96 binsize ) can sometimes make it difficult to confidently attribute signal to actual knots clustering in the disk . in the more obscure cases , clues from the larger structure of the disk may help .",
    "figure  [ corr_plot ] shows the final restricted three - point correlation signal above the 95% and 99% significance thresholds ( in black and grey shading , respectively ) from ` all ' sources with @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( top panel ) , and from the sample split into ` blue ' and ` red ' on either side of @xmath82 ( middle and bottom panels , respectively ) .",
    "if dust significantly reddens outer disk clusters , then the strength of the correlation results presented will be underestimated for young sources and overestimated for older sources .     and",
    "@xmath98 , while the lower panels result from splitting the sample into blue and red components on either side of @xmath82 ( middle and bottom panel , respectively ) .",

    "[ corr_plot],width=192 ]    the choice of the red extreme in our @xmath64 color cut ( 0.7 ) was motivated by two requirements : to retain the majority of knots most likely associated with ngc 3184 while excluding the maximum number of background sources ( mostly galaxies ) .",
    "@xcite show that the @xmath64 colors of @xmath101 late - type spirals are near 0.8 .",
    "because these and earlier - type galaxies dominate the background , we chose @xmath102 as the red extreme , with the assumption that this cut retains the majority of knots likely associated with the outer disk of ngc 3184 ( figure  [ colmag ] shows that we will retain the majority of sources between @xmath71 ) .",
    "however , because galaxies become bluer in this set of filters as @xmath103 increases , we expect increasing contamination from more distant galaxies .",
    "this is exacerbated by the evolution of galaxies because galaxies are typically brighter and bluer at higher redshift .",
    "using standard @xmath104cdm cosmology , the tabulated colors from @xcite and @xmath29 * from @xcite , we find that for @xmath105 @xmath29 * scd galaxies are included for @xmath106 .",
    "it is therefore not feasible to select a @xmath64 color cut that effectively eliminates galaxy contamination to the limits of our photometric sensitivity . because we do not exclude all background galaxies with our color cut , we require a method to statistically distinguish knots from the background@xmath107hence the correlation map approach .",
    "it is important to note that the red cut is the only form of color contrast we use to distinguish outer disk sources from the background .",
    "the final restricted three - point correlation maps provide another method to estimate the extent of the outer disk ( the first being the background - subtracted hess diagrams ) .",
    "the blue sources cluster uniformly to just beyond the optical radius , and then break into discrete aggregates that are detectable out to @xmath108 . while the red knot correlation signal is noisier , presumably due to less color distinction with the background and a less clustered distribution , there remain regions of significant clustering signal at radii comparable to those found in the blue sources .",
    "the red map is made using @xmath109 more sources than the blue map .",
    "regions of increased signal along @xmath92 in the blue source map ( e.g.  at 0.71 , 0.85 , 0.94 , and @xmath110 ) trace overdensities of knots along the spiral arms seen in the images , as do the few regions of increased signal in the red map . the regions of increased clustering signal common to both the blue and red maps near @xmath111 and @xmath110 can be visually attributed to large aggregates of knots seen in the images .",
    "for example , the overdensity near @xmath110 is likely influenced by the large aggregate shown in the bottom half of figure  [ knots_fig ] .    due to the irregular signal in figure  [ corr_plot ] , it is difficult to measure the radial extent of the outer disk directly from these maps .",
    "one way to better estimate the radial extent is to average the correlation signal below a chosen @xmath92 and determine the @xmath93 at which the average signal falls below the local averaged significance thresholds .",
    "when this is done using the fine @xmath93 binning of figure  [ corr_plot ] , a correspondingly irregular average with @xmath93 is produced ( not shown ) .",
    "rebinning the @xmath93-annuli to be @xmath112 coarser than in figure  [ corr_plot ] ( to @xmath113 kpc per bin ) results in figure  [ corr_plot_avg ] , which presents a smoother trace of average correlation signal in @xmath93 for @xmath114 kpc . also plotted are the corresponding average 95% and 99% significance thresholds in dotted and dashed linestyle , respectively , made from averaging similarly resampled threshold maps at regions @xmath114 kpc to match the data map averaging .",
    "there is clustering signal in both the blue and the red knots to @xmath115 .",

    "the significant clustering signal from the blue knots extends nearly to the dla system threshold .",
    "[ corr_plot_avg],width=192 ]    surface brightness measurements of the disk at these radii may be quite difficult .",
    "we defer a detailed surface brightness analysis of the diffuse stellar component to an upcoming paper , where we will first account for low - level scattered light in the mosaics . here",
    "we estimate the _ effective _ surface brightness ( esb ) of knot aggregates that can be detected in our correlation maps .",
    "we have inserted mock aggregates at different radii to determine the projected number density of knots necessary to produce a significant signal in our restricted three - point correlation maps .",
    "the mock aggregates are simply groupings of ` detection ' locations added to the field of real knot detection locations ; once a knot is counted as a detection within a particular color - magnitude cut , the shape and color of the knot are irrelevant for the construction of the correlation maps  only the locations of the detections are important .",
    "we therefore make no assumptions of the detailed shapes or colors of the fake knots , other than they satisfy the same criteria as the real knots to have made it into the final sample being considered .",
    "we find that a complex of 0.08 knots arcsec@xmath13 ( eight knots randomly distributed within a circular area of diameter @xmath120 ) at @xmath121 would be detected as significant signal ( above the 99% significance threshold ) in a map like those of figure  [ corr_plot ] .",
    "combining these numbers with the apparent magnitudes from our faintest detected sources ( 27.5 mag in @xmath1 ) leads us to a limiting @xmath1-band esb of @xmath122 mag arcsec@xmath13 for a significantly clustered aggregate at the limit of our photometric sensitivity .",
    "this esb is similar to the outer disk esb found from the @xmath123 background - subtracted hess diagram in figure  [ hess_2panel ] ( @xmath124 mag arcsec@xmath13 ) , although we caution that these estimates represent different samples of objects generated by separate methods .",
    "the esb estimated from the outermost @xmath125 sources remaining in the @xmath126 background - subtracted hess diagram is @xmath127 mag arcsec@xmath13 . for comparison ( primarily to the esbs estimated from our background - subtracted hess diagrams ) ,",

    ", we estimate the diffuse stellar component to be @xmath129 mag arcsec@xmath13 at @xmath130 , or @xmath131 mag brighter than the esbs found from the knots in figure  [ hess_2panel ] .",

    "figure  [ galex_corr ] is therefore made from only the brightest knots around ngc 3184 , corresponding to cluster masses of @xmath133 or larger . because the majority of our cluster - like detections correspond to @xmath134 ( figure  [ colmag ] ) , these galex data trace a different cluster population .",
    "we expect that the correlation map of figure  [ galex_corr ] would reveal structures comparable to those of figure  [ corr_plot ] with deeper galex data , although the resolution of the clustering in @xmath92 would be lower due to the @xmath135 coarser spatial resolution .",
    "the correlation signal near @xmath136 on scales @xmath137 kpc comes from the distribution of knots just visible in the galex images near the outskirts of the disk , seemingly associated with extended spiral arms .",

    "we also present a knot - knot correlation map from galex - detected objects near ngc 3184 and find significant correlation near @xmath159 , although those data are currently very limited ( the publically - available galex imaging of this field is very shallow and does not provide a large number of knots to use in the correlation analysis ) .",

    "the aggregates and knots that do dissolve , perhaps via stellar evaporation caused by encounters with neighboring clusters or giant molecular clouds ( albeit on longer timescales and with lower efficiency than expected in the inner disk ) , may distribute many of their stars into the diffuse , low surface brightness component visible in the images ( mainly as faint , extended spiral structure ) .",
    "this low surface brightness component is better seen in the @xmath1-band data , as expected by the numbers of red to blue clusters , the assumption that the larger ages of red sources means they have had more time to evaporate stars into a diffuse component , and simply because the @xmath1 image is deeper than the @xmath2 image .",

    "have convincingly demonstrated that stars will , over time , be scattered to larger radii and populate an outer disk of characteristics consistent with those measured from unresolved stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , various features of our knot population suggest that these were born in situ . first , we find knot - knot clustering out to interknot separations of 1 kpc .",

    "furthermore , @xcite detect very regular outer disk rotation curves ( i.e.  flat , low velocity dispersion ) from deep h@xmath14 spectroscopy of many nearby edge - on disks , suggesting that outer disks are merely less - populated extensions of their inner counterparts ( and therefore that in situ cluster formation should be expected ) .",
    "given the successes of the @xcite studies , as well as that of @xcite , we expect both radial migration and in situ formation to significantly influence the populations of outer disks .",
