    "these events have received increasing attention in the past several years @xcite , but their nature remains unknown .",
    "xrfs have @xmath2 durations between 10 and 200 sec and their sky distribution is consistent with isotropy . in these respects , xrfs are similar to `` classical '' grbs .",
    "a joint analysis of wfc / batse spectral data showed that the low - energy and high - energy photon indices of xrfs are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , which are similar to those of grbs , but that the xrfs had spectral peak energies @xmath5 that were much lower than those of grbs @xcite .",
    "the only difference between xrfs and grbs therefore appears to be that xrfs have lower @xmath6 values .",
    "it has therefore been suggested that xrfs might represent an extension of the grb population to bursts with low peak energies .",
    "clarifying the nature of xrfs and x - ray - rich grbs , and their connection to grbs , could provide a breakthrough in our understanding of the prompt emission of grbs . analyzing 42 x - ray - rich grbs and xrfs seen by fregate and/or the wxm instruments on hete-2 ,",
    "@xcite find that the xrfs , the x - ray - rich grbs , and grbs form a continuum in the [ @xmath7-plane ( see figure 1 , left - hand panel ) .",
    "this result strongly suggests that all of these events are the same phenomenon .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have placed 9 hete-2 grbs with known redshifts and 2 xrfs with known redshifts or strong redshift constraints in the ( @xmath8)-plane ( see figure 1 , right - hand panel ) . here",
    "@xmath9 is the isotropic - equivalent burst energy and @xmath10 is the energy of the peak of the burst spectrum , measured in the source frame .",
    "the hete-2 bursts confirm the relation between @xmath9 and @xmath10 found by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for grbs and extend it down in @xmath9 by a factor of 300 .",
    "the fact that xrf 020903 , one of the softest events localized by hete-2 to date , and xrf 030723 , the most recent xrf localized by hete-2 , lie squarely on this relation @xcite provides strong evidence that xrfs and grbs are the same phenomenon .",

    "the sxc , wxm , and fregate instruments on hete-2 have thresholds of @xmath15 kev and considerable effective areas in the x - ray energy range .",

    "the structured jet model provides a reasonable fit to grbs alone but can not provide a unified picture of both xrfs and grbs , whereas the uniform jet model can . from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=249 ]    the reason is the following : the observational implications of the structured jet model and the uniform jet model differ dramatically if they are required to explain xrfs and grbs in a unified picture . in the structured jet model , most viewing angles @xmath18",
    "are @xmath32 .",
    "this implies that the number of xrfs should exceed the number of grbs by many orders of magnitude , something that hete-2 does not observe ( see figures 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 ) . on the other hand , by choosing @xmath33 , the uniform jet model predicts equal numbers of bursts per logarithmic decade in @xmath9 ( and @xmath34 ) , which is exactly what hete-2 sees ( again , see figures 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 ) @xcite . thus , if @xmath9 spans a range @xmath27 , as the hete-2 results strongly suggest , the uniform jet model can provide a unified picture of both xrfs and grbs , whereas the structured jet model can not .",
    "this means that xrfs provide a powerful probe of grb jet structure .",
    "a range in @xmath35 of @xmath36 , which is what the hete-2 results strongly suggest , requires a _ minimum _ range in @xmath37 of @xmath38 in the uniform jet model .",
    "thus the unified picture of xrfs and grbs in the uniform jet model implies that there are @xmath39 more bursts with very small @xmath40 s for every such burst we see ; i.e. , the rate of grbs may be @xmath41 times greater than has been thought .",
    "in addition , since the observed ratio of the rate of type ic sne to the rate of grbs in the observable universe is @xmath42 @xcite , a unified picture of xrfs and grbs in the uniform jet model implies that the grb rate is comparable to that of type ic sne @xcite .",
    "more spherically symmetric jets yield xrfs and narrow jets produce grbs .",
    "thus xrfs and grbs provide a combination of grb / sn samples that would enable astronomers to study the relationship between the degree of jet - like behavior of the grb and the properties of the supernova ( brightness , polarization @xmath43 asphericity of the explosion , velocity of the explosion @xmath43 kinetic energy of the explosion , etc . ) .",
    "grbs may therefore provide a unique laboratory for understanding type ic core collapse supernovae .",
    "a unified picture of xrfs and grbs in the uniform jet model also implies that many type ic sne produce narrow jets , which may suggest that the collapsing cores of many type ic supernovae are rapidly rotating .",
    "finally , such a unified picture implies that the total radiated energy in gamma rays @xmath44 is @xmath0 100 times smaller than has been thought @xcite .",
