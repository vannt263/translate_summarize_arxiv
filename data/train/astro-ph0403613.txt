    "solar flares influence local ` space weather , ' and as a result there is a demand for accurate flare prediction",
    ". unfortunately no reliable deterministic method of predicting a flare is known , and existing methods are probabilistic in nature .",
    "a number of methods discussed in the literature are based on a commonly used white - light classification of sunspots , and the correlation between classification and flare occurrence .",
    "the mcintosh classification ( mcintosh 1990 ) categorizes a group of sunspots into one of 60 classes , based on three parameters .",
    "historical flare rates for each of the classifications were used by mcintosh ( 1990 ) as the basis of an ` expert system ' for flare prediction .",
    "the system , called theophrastus ( the associated code is called theo ) , also incorporates additional information including dynamical properties of spot growth , rotation and shear , magnetic topology inferred from sunspot structure , magnetic classification , and previous flare activity .",
    "the method is apparently somewhat subjective , involving rules of thumb incorporated by a human expert .",
    "a second approach using the mcintosh classification was presented by bornmann and shaw ( 1994 ) . in this case",
    "multiple linear regression was used to determine the effective contribution of each of the mcintosh parameters to the rate of flaring , based on historical records of flaring .",
    "codes based on the methods of mcintosh ( 1990 ) and bornmann and shaw ( 1994 ) are used by the ionospheric prediction service ( ips ) of australia to issue flare predictions at their learmonth and culgoora observatories .",
    "recently gallagher , moon and wang ( 2002 ) implemented a system using historical averages of flare numbers for mcintosh classifications to predict a rate for an active region , and then converted this to a probability of flaring in a day using the assumption of poisson statistics .",
    "this prediction is given as part of the big bear solar observatory active region monitor ( arm ) .",
    "finally the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) issues flare probability forecasts for active regions which include input from theo .",
    "a shortcoming of methods relying on correlations of flaring with active region classification based on historical records is that they ignore the important information of how many flares the active region of interest has already produced .",
    "the system of mcintosh ( 1990 ) incorporates information about previous activity , but it is unclear how objectively this is done , and the information is limited to the number of large flares already produced by the given active region . in the flare prediction literature , the tendency of a region which has produced large flares in the past to produce large flares in the future is called persistence , which is recognised as one of the most reliable predictors for large flare occurrence in 24-hour forecasts ( e.g.  neidig , weiborg , & seagraves 1989 ) . in this paper we argue that the history of occurrence of all flares ( large and small ) observed in a given active region is an important indicator as to how the region will flare in the future , and should be used in any prediction .",
    "a related criticism of methods based on classification and historical records is that a given classification may embrace active regions with a variety of flaring rates .",
    "if an active region has a flaring rate differing from the average historical rate for its class then the predictions will be in error .",
    "studies of solar flare statistics provide simple phenomenological rules describing flare occurrence .",
    "it is well known that flares follow a power - law size distribution , where by size we mean e.g.  peak flux in soft x - ray .",
    "more formally the flare frequency - size distribution @xmath0 ( i.e.  the number of events per unit size @xmath1 and per unit time ) may be written @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constants . the exact power - law index @xmath4 depends on the choice of the quantity @xmath1 , but typically it is found to be in the range 1.5 to 2 ( e.g.  crosby , aschwanden , & dennis 1992 ) .",
    "the power law index @xmath4 appears to be the same in different active regions  @xcite , although there is some evidence that it varies with the solar cycle  @xcite .",
    "a second simple rule concerns the way flares occur in time .",
    "studies of the rate of occurrence of soft x - ray flares in individual active regions suggest that events occur as a poisson process in time ( e.g.  moon et al .",
    "2001 ) , although many active regions exhibit changes in the mean rate of events ( wheatland 2001 ) .    in this paper",
    "we show how the observed record of flaring in an active region may be used together with the phenomenological rules of flare statistics to objectively refine an initial flare prediction .",
    "the initial prediction may be based on the mcintosh classification , or may come from any other prediction method which does not consider the flare data .",
    "the new method is envisaged to work as follows .",
    "when an active region appears at the east limb of the sun , the best guess as to its future flare productivity comes from one of the conventional prediction methods .",
    "however , as the active region produces flares , the observed flare statistics are used to adjust the prediction for future flaring . after many flares",
    "have been observed , the prediction for future flaring may be dominated by the contribution from the observed data .",
    "this process  refining a probability estimate based on new data  is naturally performed using bayes s theorem ( e.g.  sivia 1996 ; jaynes 2003 ) .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in  2 a simple approach to flare prediction using only the past record of flaring from an active region [ previously presented in wheatland ( 2001 ) ]",
    "is reiterated . in ",
    "3 the new method of prediction , combining existing methods and information from observed flare statistics , is described . in ",
    "4 simulations are presented showing how the method uses the observed flaring record , and in  5 the results are discussed .",
    "wheatland ( 2001 ) presented a method for flare prediction using only observed flare statistics and the assumptions that flares obey poisson statistics in time , and power - law statistics in size , elaborating on a suggestion by moon et al .",
    "the approach is briefly reiterated here , since it is part of the new method .",
    "first assume that there is a threshold size @xmath5 above which all events occurring in an active region are observed , so that the distribution  ( [ eq : pldist ] ) applies for events above that size .",
    "the total rate of events larger than @xmath5 is then @xmath6 assuming @xmath7 .",
    "hence the frequency - size distribution may be rewritten @xmath8 suppose the probability of a big event in a given period @xmath9 is required , where by big we mean an event at least as large as @xmath10 . according to the distribution  ( [ eq : fdist ] )",
    "the rate of events larger than @xmath10 is @xmath11    applying the poisson model of flare occurrence , the probability of at least one big event during a period @xmath9 is given by poisson statistics as @xmath12    equations  ( [ eq : rate_big ] ) and  ( [ eq : prob_big ] ) provide the required estimate .",
    "the quantities @xmath5 , @xmath10 and @xmath9 are chosen , and then the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath4 ( if the precise value of @xmath4 is assumed unknown ) need to be estimated from the past history of flaring of the active region .",
    "wheatland ( 2001 ) assumed that @xmath4 is the same for all active regions , and hence known ( see wheatland 2000 ) , and estimated @xmath13 using the bayesian procedure of scargle ( 1998 ) .",
    "the rationale behind the method of wheatland ( 2001 ) is that the flare frequency - size distribution is steep so there are very many small events , which allows @xmath13 to be estimated relatively accurately from the observed history of flaring in an active region .",
    "hence the estimate of @xmath14 should be relatively accurate . to make this point quantitative , note that from equations  ( [ eq : rate_big ] ) and  ( [ eq : prob_big ] ) the uncertainty in the estimate of the probability @xmath15 is given approximately by @xmath16 -1 }    \\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\lambda_1},\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the uncertainty in @xmath13 , and where we have ignored any uncertainty in @xmath4 .",
    "assuming @xmath18 leads to @xmath19 . if the rate @xmath13 is determined from @xmath20 observed events , then for poisson statistics we expect @xmath21 , and hence @xmath22 equation  ( [ eq : unc ] ) provides a crude estimate of the accuracy of the method . to achieve a 10% accuracy in the estimate",
    "requires of order 100 observed events .",
    "the wheatland ( 2001 ) method shows how to use the flaring record for an active region to make a flare prediction , but it ignores the other information which is normally the basis of prediction .",
    "it is sensible to combine all of the available information , and in this section we consider how to do this .",
    "we assume that a sequence of events with sizes @xmath23 ( all larger than @xmath5 ) are observed to occur at times @xmath24 respectively in an active region .",
    "these events occur within an observing interval which starts at time @xmath25 and ends at time @xmath26 .",
    "we also have additional information , which we label @xmath27 , including our knowledge of the phenomenological rules of flare statistics , and e.g.  the mcintosh classification of the active region .",
    "the problem is then to estimate @xmath14 , the probability of a big event , based on the data and the additional information @xmath27 . by ` estimating @xmath14 ' we strictly mean that we want to calculate a probability distribution for the quantity @xmath14 , based on the available information .",
    "the peak of this distribution is our most likely value for the probability of occurrence of a big flare , and the width of the distribution is a measure of the uncertainty of that value . to do this",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "first we estimate ( calculate probability distributions for ) @xmath13 and @xmath4 based on the available information , and then we use these distributions to estimate @xmath28 .",
    "then we use this distribution together with the relationship  ( [ eq : prob_big ] ) to estimate the desired quantity @xmath14 .",
    "we now consider each of these steps in turn .",
    "first we consider the calculation of @xmath29 , the probability distribution for the power - law index @xmath4 . when the actual functional form of the distribution is needed .",
    "when this is not the case the generic label @xmath30 is used to denote a distribution . ]",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , wheatland ( 2000 ) found that the index @xmath4 is independent of active region for a set of hard x - ray events , although the statistics underlying the study were somewhat poor .",
    "if @xmath4 is the same in all active regions then the observations @xmath23 can be replaced by a larger set of events over many active regions .",
    "we return to this point in  3.4 , but for now admit the possibility that @xmath4 is different in different active regions , and consider its estimation based on data for the given active region alone .",
    "bai ( 1993 ) has shown how to estimate a power - law index for a set of data , using ` maximum likelihood ' .",
    "following bai , the likelihood function , that is the probability of the observed data @xmath31 given the model , is ( assuming @xmath7 ) @xmath32 where @xmath27 stands for all additional information , including knowledge of the phenomenological rule  ( [ eq : pldist ] ) .",
    "we note that this expression requires @xmath33 , which follows from the requirement that the probability distribution for size @xmath1 is normalized over all @xmath1 larger than @xmath5 .",
    "it is not necessary to introduce an upper cutoff for @xmath1 in the present treatment ( provided @xmath33 ) , although an upper cutoff is necessary to ensure that the mean flare size is finite , if @xmath34 .",
    "we will return to this point in  5 .",
    "bayes s theorem may be used to convert the likelihood into the probability of the model given the data , which is what we are interested in : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ` prior distribution ' for @xmath4 , i.e.  the distribution we would assign to @xmath4 in the absence of the data ( e.g.  sivia 1996 ) .",
    "a choice needs to be made for this distribution , and a common choice is to assume a constant value within minimum and maximum values @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively : @xmath39 which is referred to as a ` uniform prior ' . we note that for a uniform prior the most likely value of @xmath4 is the maximum of the likelihood function : @xmath40 which is the maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath4 found by bai .",
    "we can identify @xmath41 with @xmath42 , and then equations  ( [ eq : gam_like ] ) and  ( [ eq : p_gam_bayes ] ) give the required ` posterior distribution ' for @xmath4 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and where we have relabelled the prior distribution @xmath45 .",
    "the normalizing factor @xmath46 is determined by the requirement @xmath47 . , although they refer to different values .",
    "it is understood that in each case the value @xmath46 is to be determined by integration . ] for a uniform prior the integral may be performed , leading to @xmath48    - p[m+1 , ( \\gamma_1 - 1)\\ln \\pi ] } , \\ ] ] where @xmath49 denotes the incomplete gamma function  .    before proceeding we present a rough estimate of the uncertainty in the most likely value of @xmath4 based on the distribution @xmath42 with a uniform prior .",
    "assuming gaussian behavior in the vicinity of the peak , the width of the distribution  ( [ eq : prob_gam ] ) is @xmath50^{-1/2}$ ] , where @xmath51 , and where @xmath52 is the location of the peak of the distribution ( sivia 1996 ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath53 , and using equation  ( [ eq : gam_ml ] ) gives @xmath54      next we consider the calculation of @xmath55 , the distribution of the rate @xmath13 of flares larger than @xmath5 .",
    "this is a more difficult problem because the rate of flaring in an active region may vary with time  ( see e.g.  wheatland 2001 ) .",
    "however , observations suggest that a piecewise - constant poisson process provides a good model for the way flares occur in time in individual active regions .",
    "we assume that a period of time of duration @xmath56 immediately prior to @xmath26 is identified ( i.e.  from @xmath57 to @xmath58 ) during which time flare occurrence is consistent with a constant - rate poisson process .",
    "one approach to identifying the necessary period of time has been presented by scargle ( 1998 ) , who showed how to select a piecewise - constant poisson model to describe an observed sequence of events .",
    "when applied to a sequence of events at times @xmath59 the scargle method gives a sequence of times @xmath60 at which the rate is determined to change ( where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the start and end of the observing period ) , and a corresponding sequence @xmath63 of rates .",
    "the sequence of times and rates is called a set of ` bayesian blocks ' . in this case",
    "we identify @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "we note that the original bayesian blocks procedure [ which was used e.g.  by wheatland ( 2001 ) ] does not necessarily select the best piecewise - constant model .",
    "recently scargle has found a computationally feasible way to determine the optimal decomposition ( scargle , private communication , 2003 ) .",
    "we begin by assuming this method ( or another method ) has been applied to the data , to determine the required period @xmath64 prior to the end of observations .",
    "a probability distribution for the rate @xmath13 is then be determined as follows .",
    "we assume that @xmath66 events are observed during the selected period @xmath64 .",
    "the probability of the observed data @xmath67 ( strictly this comprises not just the number of events but also their times ) given a poisson model with rate @xmath13 is @xmath68 where we retain only the dependence on @xmath13 on the right hand side of this equation , and where we formally recognise any additional information by the dependence on @xmath27 .",
    "bayes s theorem may be used to turn this likelihood into a probability of the model given the data , and the additional information : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the prior distribution for the rate .",
    "the prior distribution @xmath71 represents the estimate of the rate of flaring for the active region in the absence of any data .",
    "this distribution allows the incorporation of any additional information we have about the expected rate of flaring , not including the actual data . to make this concrete",
    ", we will consider the case that the additional information is the mcintosh classification of the sunspots associated with the active region , although we stress that any other additional information can also be incorporated .",
    "when the additional information is the mcintosh classification , a suitable prior distribution can be constructed from historical records of the observed rates of events above size @xmath5 for every active region of the same class .",
    "this is a generalization of the analysis underlying present flare prediction methods based on mcintosh classification , which considers only the mean flaring rate extracted from historical data .",
    "hence we propose the construction of distributions of flaring rate for each mcintosh classification .",
    "we assume these are available , and label the appropriate distribution @xmath72 , where mc denotes mcintosh classification .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : pmkdk ] ) then becomes @xmath73 where we have identified @xmath74 with @xmath55 , and and where @xmath46 is the normalization factor .",
    "this is the required posterior distribution for @xmath13 .",
    "it should be noted that the distribution  ( [ eq : prob_lam1 ] ) explicitly uses only a subset of all flares observed in an active region , i.e.  the @xmath66 flares observed during the interval @xmath56 .",
    "previous data contribute only to the determination of the interval @xmath64 .",
    "the motivation is that when the rate changes , the old rate is no longer relevant for future prediction . for many active regions",
    "the observed rate appears to be constant during a transit of the disk , or at least no rate change is detectable ( e.g.  wheatland 2001 ) , in which case all observed flares contribute explicitly to the inference .    before proceeding we",
    "note two simple results for equation  ( [ eq : prob_lam1 ] ) with a uniform prior .",
    "first , it is easy to see that with a uniform prior the maximum of this distribution occurs at @xmath75 .",
    "second we note the well known result that for large @xmath76 and neglecting the prior , equation  ( [ eq : prob_lam1 ] ) approximates a gaussian with a width @xmath77 which is consistent with the arguments at the end of  2 .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath78 for the rate @xmath28 of flares larger than @xmath10 may be constructed from the distributions @xmath55 and @xmath42 using equation  ( [ eq : rate_big ] ) .",

    ", observations suggest that @xmath4 is the same in all active regions , in which case the index can be determined very accurately from events over many active regions using equation  ( [ eq : gam_ml ] ) . if the estimate is @xmath52 , then we can consider the prior distribution for @xmath4 to be @xmath89 , and equation  ( [ eq : pbig_general ] ) simplifies to @xmath90^{m^{\\prime } }     ( 1-\\epsilon ) ^{\\left ( t^{\\prime}/\\delta t\\right )    \\left(s_2/s_1\\right)^{\\gamma^{\\ast}-1}-1 }     \\lambda_{\\rm mc } \\left[-\\frac{\\ln ( 1-\\epsilon ) } { \\delta t }     \\left(\\frac{s_2}{s_1}\\right)^{\\gamma^{\\ast}-1 } \\right].\\ ] ]    equations  ( [ eq : pbig_general ] ) , ( [ eq : fjoint ] ) and  ( [ eq : pbig_simp ] ) are the required expressions for the posterior probability distribution for @xmath14 .",
    "we present two simulations demonstrating the application of the method to synthetic data .",
    "these simulations omit the inclusion of other information via the prior @xmath72 , so they illustrate only how the method performs using the observed data .",
    "first we consider the case that @xmath4 is assumed to be known .",
    "ten days of flaring were simulated by producing a sequence of event times as a poisson process in time with a rate @xmath91 per day for the first five days , and with a rate @xmath92 per day for the second five days . each event",
    "was assigned a size according to a power law distribution with an index @xmath93 , above the threshold size @xmath94 ( in arbitrary units ) .",
    "figure  1 illustrates a typical simulation .",
    "the first ( upper ) panel shows the size of each event versus the time at which the event occurred . in this case",
    "there were 31 events .",
    "the simulation applies the method to the problem of predicting the probability of a big event occurring during the next day ( @xmath95 day ) at the end of the ten days .",
    "the size of a big event was taken to be @xmath96 .",
    "the original bayesian blocks procedure  ( scargle 1998 ) was applied to the event time series to determine a decomposition into a sequence of piecewise - constant intervals and rates .",
    "the second panel of figure  1 shows the result of this process : the solid lines indicate the rate as a function of time inferred by the bayesian blocks procedure , and the dotted lines indicate the true rate versus time .",
    "the bayesian blocks procedure correctly identifies a two - rate model as the most likely model , and identifies the approximate time of the change in rate .",
    "the third panel shows the probability distribution @xmath82 obtained from equation  ( [ eq : pbig_simp ] ) with a uniform prior for @xmath13 , and with @xmath97 and @xmath64 equal to the number of events in the second bayesian block and the duration of the second bayesian block respectively .",
    "the dotted vertical line in this panel is the true value of @xmath14 .",
    "we see that , even for a relatively small number of events , the method is able to provide a good estimate of the probability of a big event .",
    "the width of the inferred distribution for @xmath14 is consistent with equation  ( [ eq : unc ] ) .",
    "second we consider the more difficult case of simultaneously estimating @xmath4 and @xmath13 .",
    "ten days of flaring were again simulated , with a rate @xmath98 per day for the first five days , and a rate @xmath99 per day for the second five days .",
    "larger rates were chosen to provide more events for the inference , but the other parameters were kept the same as in the first simulation .",
    "figure  2 illustrates the results of a typical simulation .",
    "the first ( upper ) panel shows the time history of events  in this case 57 events occurred .",
    "the second panel shows the result of a bayesian blocks decomposition of the data ( solid lines ) together with the true rate versus time ( dotted lines ) .",
    "once again the bayesian blocks procedure correctly identifies a two - rate model as the most likely model , and identifies the approximate time of the change in rate .",
    "the third panel shows the result of using equation  ( [ eq : prob_gam ] )  with a uniform prior with @xmath100 and @xmath101  to construct the distribution for @xmath4 .",
    "the dotted vertical line in this panel shows the true value of @xmath4 .",
    "the fourth panel of figure  2 shows the distribution for @xmath14 constructed using equation  ( [ eq : pbig_general ] ) , with @xmath102 , with @xmath97 and @xmath64 obtained from the second bayesian block , and with uniform prior distributions for @xmath4 and @xmath13 .",
    "the dotted vertical line indicates the true value . from this simulation",
    "we see that a reasonable estimate for @xmath15 is obtained for a relatively small number of events .",
    "the distribution for @xmath15 obtained in the lower panel of figure  2 is quite broad .",
    "a basic reason is that @xmath14 depends sensitively on @xmath4 because of its appearance as an exponent in equation  ( [ eq : rate_big ] ) , and @xmath4 has a range of possible values , as shown in the third panel of figure  2 .",
    "this effect may be seen by considering @xmath88 [ defined by equation  ( [ eq : fjoint ] ) ] , which is the joint distribution of @xmath14 and @xmath4 .",
    "figure  3 shows a contour plot of @xmath88 for the simulation depicted in figure  2 .",
    "the dotted vertical and horizontal lines are the true values of @xmath14 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "the dashed curve is defined by @xmath103 $ ] , and the contours of @xmath88 are observed to be stretched out along this curve .",
    "the practical implication of this figure is that accurate estimation of @xmath14 depends on accurate estimation of @xmath4 . in practice @xmath4",
    "is known a priori quite accurately , but in this simulation we have assumed that @xmath4 is initially unknown ( within the range 1.25 to 2.25 ) , to illustrate the process of inference .",
    "existing methods of solar flare prediction do not make complete use of an important source of information : the time history of flares already observed in the active region of interest , in particular frequently occurring small events .",
    "a new method for flare prediction is presented which exploits the observed history of flaring from an active region to improve an initial prediction , which e.g.  may come from one of the existing methods . to make the example concrete",
    "we may think of the initial prediction coming from from the mcintosh sunspot classification , which is a common basis for prediction .",
    "this background information provides an initial estimate for the expected flaring rate through a prior distribution @xmath104 , which represents the probability that the flaring rate above a ( small ) size @xmath5 is @xmath13 , given historical rates of occurrence of flares for the given mcintosh class",
    ". bayes s theorem is then used to estimate the probability @xmath14 of observing a large flare ( above size @xmath10 ) in a given period of time , based on this prior information and on the sequence of flares already produced by the active region , and assuming simple phenomenological rules describing the occurrence of flares . in this paper the basic theory behind the inference of @xmath14 based on observed data is presented .",
    "the inclusion of background information [ i.e.  the construction of the priors @xmath104 ] is yet to be done .",
    "the method relies on event sizes following the phenomenological law  ( [ eq : pldist ] )",
    ". some studies of very small extreme ultraviolet events ( ` nanoflares ' ) suggest that their thermal energies follow a steeper distribution than energies of large events ( e.g.  krucker and benz 1998 ; parnell and jupp 2000 ) , although this remains controversial ( e.g.  aschwanden and parnell 2002 ) . from the point of view of the prediction method presented here ,",
    "the uncertainty over the low - size end of the distribution is irrelevant provided events significantly larger than nanoflares are used . in any case the observed distributions from many active regions may be examined as a check on equation  ( [ eq : pldist ] ) .",
    "a related point is that the distribution  ( [ eq : pldist ] ) requires a cutoff at large sizes on energetics grounds , and neglect of this cutoff will lead to the number of large flares being overestimated .",
    "a cutoff will be incorporated before the method is applied to real data .",
    "the choice of the quantity @xmath1 has not been addressed , although a good choice is likely to be important to the method .",
    "most flare forecasting deals with soft x - ray events , in particular prediction of goes ( geostationary observational environmental satellite ) m and x class events ( events with peak fluxes greater than @xmath106w / m@xmath107 and @xmath108w / m@xmath107 respectively in the 1 - 8 angstrom band observed by the satellites ) . a practical motivation for this is that flare soft x - ray emission causes disturbances of the ionosphere which affect shortwave radio communication , and there is a need to predict these occurrences .",
    "a disadvantage of using goes events is that they are not ideal for flare statistics e.g.  because of problems with event selection due to the large background in soft x - ray ( see wheatland 2001 ) .",
    "a number of other issues also need to be considered before the method is implemented with real data .",
    "a point neglected so far is that active regions evolve , so that predictions based on the traditional methods also change with time .",
    "for example , an active region evolves through mcintosh classifications ( e.g.  bornmann , kalmbach , kulhanek , and casale 1990 ) .",
    "changes in background information such as this should be incorporated through changes in the prior , and this question will be considered in more detail in future work . a related point concerns the construction of the prior distributions for rate .",
    "it is likely that the mcintosh classification will be used , although other possibilities will be considered .",
    "the problem is then to determine the probability of a given mcintosh class having a given rate , based on observed flaring sequences in the historical record for active regions of that class .",
    "the details of this calculation will be addressed in future work .    finally , as with all methods of forecasting , it is essential to test the reliability of the method",
    ". it is straightforward to compare , after the fact , the number of predicted and the number of observed events for a large sample of active regions .",
    "the method presented here will be implemented and tested in this way , and the results compared with existing methods of prediction .",
