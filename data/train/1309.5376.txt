    "the field of exact enumeration of tilings ( equivalently , perfect matchings ) dates back to the early 1900 s when macmahon proved his classical theorem on the number of plane partitions that fit in a given box ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this theorem is equivalent to the fact that the number of unit rhombus ( or lozenge ) tilings of a hexagon @xmath0 of side - lengths @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( in cyclic order ) drawn on the triangular lattice is equal to @xmath4 ( we use the operator @xmath5 to denote both the number of tilings of a lattice region and the number of perfect matchings of a graph , as the two objects can be identified by a well known bijection ) .",
    "another classical result , from the early 1960 s , is the enumeration of domino tilings of a rectangle on the square lattice , due independently to kasteleyn @xcite and temperley and fisher @xcite .",
    "this states that the number of domino tilings of a @xmath6 by @xmath7 rectangle on the square lattice equals @xmath8        in the early 1990 s , elkies , kuperberg , larsen and propp @xcite considered another family of simple regions on the square lattice called aztec diamonds ( see figure [ aztecdiamond ] for an example ) , and proved that the number of domino tilings of the aztec diamond of order @xmath9 is given by the simple formula @xmath10    a large body of related work followed ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the references in @xcite for a more extensive list ) , centered on families of lattice regions whose tilings are enumerated by simple product formulas",
    ". the state of affairs at the end of that decade is captured by propp s paper @xcite published in 1999 , which presented a list of 32 open problems in the field of enumeration of perfect matchings .",
    "most of those 32 problems have been solved in the meanwhile , but some are still open . in this paper",
    "we solve and generalize one of these open problems ( problem 16 on propp s list @xcite ) .",
    "our methods also provide a new proof and a generalization for a related result of douglas @xcite .",
    "problem 16 on propp s list @xcite concerns a family of quasi - hexagonal regions on the lattice obtained from the square lattice by drawing in every third southwest - to - northeast diagonal .",
    "the case when the side - lengths of the quasi - hexagon are @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath12 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath12 ( clockwise from top ) is illustrated in figure [ hexagonp ] .",
    "problem 16 of @xcite asks for a formula for the number of tilings of the quasi - hexagon of sides @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( the sides of length @xmath1 are the ones along _ _ diagonals _ _ of the square lattice ) , where the allowed tiles are unions of two fundamental regions of the resulting dissection of the square lattice sharing an edge .

    "we prove a simple product formula in the case @xmath16 , which was previously open .",
    "the result turns out to fully justify propp s initial motivation , stated in @xcite : `` one reason for my special interest in problem 16 is that it seems to be a genuine hybrid of domino tilings of aztec diamonds and lozenge tilings of hexagons . ''",
    "indeed , we show that by a sequence of graph transformations  which can also be used to prove the aztec diamond theorem ( [ diamond ] )  the dual graph can be transformed into a honeycomb graph whose number of perfect matchings is given by macmahon s formula ( [ mcmahon ] ) .",
