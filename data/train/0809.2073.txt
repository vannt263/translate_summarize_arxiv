    "xz tauri ( hbc 50 , haro 6 - 15 ) is a pre - main sequence binary system located in the l1551 molecular cloud at a distance of 140 pc .",
    "both components of the 03 binary have strong emission lines that are characteristic of classical t tauri stars ( hartigan & kenyon 2003 ; white & ghez 2001 ) .",
    "these studies have determined spectral types of m3-m3.5 for the southern component and m1.5-m2 for the northern one .",
    "the spectrum of the s component in our data ( hereafter xz tau a ) indicates that it is a typical t tauri star , while the n component ( xz tau b ) has large amount of spectral veiling and numerous emission lines , especially ca  ii ( hartigan & kenyon 2003 ) .",
    "the relative brightnesses of the two components fluctuates at optical wavelengths , with the s component 12 mags brighter in 1995 and 1997 _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) images ( krist et al .",
    "1997 ; white & ghez 2001 ) and the n component brighter in 1996 and 2000 ( white & ghez 2001 ; hartigan & kenyon 2003 ) .",
    "the xz tau system is an x - ray source with strong variability and a hard spectrum ( carkner et al . 1996 ; knig et al . 2001 ; giardino et al .",
    "it is also a 3.6 cm radio continuum source ( rodriguez et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "xz tau was identified by mundt et al .",
    "( 1990 ) as the source of a bipolar , collimated outflow ( hh 152 ) along a position angle of @xmath3 with radial velocities of up to @xmath4 km s@xmath1 , and the blueshifted lobe to the n. welch et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found an expanding shell of @xmath5co emission @xmath6 pc across and centered on xz tau , which may be related to this outflow .",
    "krist et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) resolved the inner parts of the outflow using psf - subtracted _ hst _ images , finding an unusual bubble of emission nebulosity within 5of the star .",
    "marked changes were seen in this bubble over 1995  1998 : the onset of limb brightening , the dissipation of a bright knot within the bubble , and large outward proper motions ( @xmath2 150 km s@xmath1 ) indicative of a dynamical age of only 20 years . however , they were unable to determine if the bubble energetics were dominated by the energy of an initial blast or the ongoing input of energy from a continuous jet .    to measure flow accelerations and monitor the growth and decay of emission knots , multiple epochs and high spatial resolution are needed .",
    "_ hst _ is a particularly valuable tool for the study of herbig - haro flows such as xz tau s . for sources at 140 pc distance",
    ", its @xmath2005 resolution corresponds to linear scales of @xmath7 m , small enough to resolve the cooling zones of radiative shocks .",
    "this resolution is also sufficient to measure proper motions of @xmath2100 km s@xmath1 on temporal baselines of only one year .",
    "we report here the results of an imaging campaign spanning 1995  2005 that monitored the evolution of the xz tau outflow .",
    "the new data include emission line images that reveal the excitation structure of the xz tau bubble , and deeper , wider - field images taken with the _ hst _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "some of our data has also been discussed by coffey et al .",
    "our monitoring campaign consisted of deep _ hst _ imaging of the xz tau field at multiple epochs over 1995  2004 , with an additional observation serendipitously obtained in another program in 2005 ( table 1 ) .",
    "the images were taken using the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and the acs .",
    "most of these also include the young stars hl tauri ( stapelfeldt et al . 1995 ) , hh 30 ( burrows et al . 1996 ; watson & stapelfeldt 2007 ) , and lkh@xmath0 358 . the entire 2004 acs f625w field is shown in figure 1 with the xz tau stellar components subtracted as described later .",
    "approximately 3.5on a side , the field includes the jet and edge - on disk of hh 30 , the jet and envelope of the obscured star hl tau , and the nebulous star lkh@xmath0 358 .",
    "reflection nebulosity fills much of the field .",
    "the smaller wfpc2 fields , @xmath22.6 on a side , cover the central portion of this frame . except for the xz tau bubble and hh 30 outflows , it is difficult to distinguish reflection and emission nebulosity in this broadband image .",
    "a color version of a portion of this field using the acs fr656n and f658n images is shown in figure 2 , highlighting the emission nebulosities .",
    "eight epochs of images from 1995  2002 were obtained with wfpc2 .",
    "seven of these were sensitive enough to detect xz tau outflow structures .",
    "the wfpc2 planetary camera ( pc1 ; 00455 per pixel ) was used for all of these observations except december 1998 , when the wfpc2 wide field camera channel 2 ( wf2 ; 00997 per pixel ) was used .",
    "f675w ( wfpc2 @xmath8 band ) images were taken at all of these epochs .",
    "this filter s bandpass includes several nebular emission lines , including h@xmath0 , [ s  ii ] , [ n  ii ] , and [ o  i ] .",
    "f814w ( wfpc2 @xmath9 band ) images , which are devoid of significant emission lines , were taken in 1995 , 1999 , and 2000 to search for circumstellar or circumbinary disks in reflected light , though none were detected .",
    "the four observations during 1999  2002 also included exposures in the f656n ( h@xmath0 ) and f673n ( [ s  ii ] ) narrowband filters . the 1998  2002 pc1 sequences comprised both deep integrations and short , unsaturated exposures to allow measurements of the positions and fluxes of the binary components . the 1998 wf2 observations included f439w ( wfpc2 @xmath10 band ) and deep f675w images ( figure 3 ) .",
    "a defocused ghost image of the binary is seen in the wf2 f675w image 8ne of the stars near the axis of the bubble .",
    "the 2004 and 2005 images were taken using the acs wide field camera ( wfc ; @xmath2005 per pixel ) .",
    "the wfc provides a significant improvement over wfpc2 .",
    "it has 34 times more throughput than wfpc2 in the @xmath8 band , covers a larger area , and has lower read noise .",
    "it also lacks the backscatter created by the matte surface of the wfpc2 ccds that creates an additional halo of scattered light around stars . as a newer camera",
    ", it also has no significant trailing artifacts caused by reduced charge transfer efficiency from radiation damage that increases the background noise in wfpc2 due to trailing of cosmic rays .",
    "the acs wfc images from 2004 were taken through filters f625w ( sloan @xmath11 ) , f658n ( h@xmath0 and [ n  ii ] ) , and fr656n , which is a ramp filter that was positioned to provide [ s  ii ] line imaging at @xmath12 = 6730  .",
    "the fr656n filter has a reduced field that limited imaging to the region close xz tau , including hl tau but not hh 30 or lkh@xmath0 358 .",
    "the f625w filter bandpass includes the same emission lines as wfpc2 f675w .",
    "short and long exposures were taken in each filter to provide combined , high - dynamic - range images . to provide a reference point spread function ( psf ) for subtraction of the xz tau stars ,",
    "separate observations were also made of hd 225213 , an isolated m1v star ( @xmath13=8.57 ) .",
    "short ( 0.5 s ) and medium ( 40 s , 50 s , and 75 s in f625w , f658n , and fr656n , respectively ) exposures in each filter were taken of this star , providing comparable signal levels to the xz tau images .",
    "the star was saturated in the short exposures ( 0.5 s is the shortest exposure possible with the wfc ) .",
    "the 2005 acs wfc images were taken through 0 , 60 , and 120polarizers with filter f606w ( acs wide @xmath13 ) , which contains the same emission lines as acs f625w and wfpc2 f675w . these were part of _ hst _ program 10178 that studied the polarization of nearby hl tau .",
    "exposures of 536 s each were taken in each polarizer .",
    "unsaturated images of the stars at this epoch were not available .",
    "the polarizers have a limited field of view , so hh 30 was not visible .",
    "no reference psf star images were obtained at this epoch .",
    "the wfpc2 and acs images were calibrated ( bias and dark subtraction , flat fielding ) by the _ hst _ pipeline .",
    "duplicate exposures were combined using cosmic ray rejection .",
    "when available , scaled data from short exposures replaced saturated pixels in longer ones . because wfpc2 has a small amount of geometric distortion across its field , after psf subtraction the images were remapped using cubic convolution interpolation and the distortion solutions provided by the space telescope science institute .",
    "acs has significantly more distortion than wfpc2 , and its psf - subtracted images were likewise corrected .",
    "distortion corrections were applied after subtraction to reduce the number of interpolations ( the target and reference psfs were taken at similar field positions ) .",
    "the acs polarizers introduce an additional amount of distortion .",
    "our analyses of normal and polarized acs images of the same star field corrected for distortion by the _ hst _",
    "pipeline indicated that the current distortion solutions for the polarizers result in 2  3 pixel errors across the field .",
    "these solutions were derived from pre - launch calibrations and have not been verified with on - orbit data until now ( polarizers are usually used with the smaller - field high resolution camera and rarely with the wfc ) .",
    "we produced a refined solution for each polarizer by fitting polynomials to the positions of @xmath14 stars measured in the uncorrected - polarized and corrected - nonpolarized star field images .",
    "the new solution reduces the maximum errors , when compared to the unpolarized image , to @xmath15 pixel across the field .",
    "this distortion solution is available from the author .",
    "as we are interested in intensity rather than polarization , the polarized images were combined .",
    "the 60and 120polarizer images were shifted by subpixel amounts to align them with the 0image , and the three registered images were then added together to form an intensity image using the weights described in the acs data handbook ( pavlovsky et al .",
    "2006 ) . because the distortion for each polarizer is different , the separate images needed to be undistorted prior to combining and psf subtraction .",

    "the mean surface brightness of the xz tau nebula within 2 3of the stars is comparable to that of the wings of the stellar psfs in the @xmath8 band images . in these broadband filters ,",
    "the line emission from the nebula must compete with the continuum flux in the wings of the psfs . in the narrowband filters the contrast is more favorable .",
    "the psf wings can be greatly reduced to improve the contrast by subtracting an image of another point source that is registered in position and scaled in intensity to the target . because of diffraction and scattering effects , the fine structure in the psf is wavelength - dependent and is sensitive to the color of the star over a broad passband .",
    "the best subtractions are achieved using a reference star image of similar color as the target . in wfpc2",
    ", the high - spatial - frequency psf structure also varies depending on the position of the object in the field of view .",
    "mismatches between psfs caused by positional differences can create significant subtraction residuals .",
    "acs psfs are largely position - independent , except in the core where field - dependent focus , coma , and astigmatism effects are seen over large field angles .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "psf also varies slightly in focus over an orbit due to thermal effects .    in the wfpc2 pc1 images ,",
    "xz tau was observed near the edge of the field , and a review of data in the _ hst _ archive did not provide any suitably exposed reference psf stars near the same location in the filters used .",
    "the only available alternative was to use simulated psfs produced by the tiny tim software package ( krist & hook 1997 ) .",
    "while such psfs can be generated for a given object color and position on the detector , they do not fully reproduce the details in the wings , resulting in some significant subtraction residuals .",
    "they can , however , match quite well in the core given an accurate set of optical aberration parameters , and they can be created on subsampled grids that enable improved registration to the observed stars .",
    "they are thus useful for psf fitting photometry , especially of close binaries like xz tau .    as in our previous analysis of the 1998 xz tau image , phase retrieval ( krist &",
    "burrows 1995 ) was used to measure the aberrations appropriate for each image to produce the most accurate tiny tim models .",
    "this process is essentially fitting psf models to the observed image while iteratively adjusting the aberration parameters ( defocus , coma , astigmatism ) until an optimal match is achieved .",
    "the brighter star in each image was fitted while the fainter one was masked .",
    "the derived aberrations were then entered into tiny tim .",
    "object spectra were chosen that matched the reported types and extinctions .",
    "the models were then generated on grids subsampled by a factor of five along each axis .",
    "the binary components in each filter at each epoch were simultaneously fitted using the model psfs . at each iteration of this nonlinear",
    "least squares optimization process the position of each star s psf was adjusted by a subpixel amount using cubic convolution interpolation and its intensity updated .",
    "the resulting subsampled , synthetic image of the binary was rebinned to normal pixel scaling and convolved with a kernel that reproduces blurring caused by ccd charge diffusion .",
    "this process not only provides photometry and astrometry of the binary but also creates a synthetic image of the binary that can be subtracted from the observed data .",
    "the 1995 wfpc2 f675w pc1 , 1998 wfpc2 wf2 , and 2005 acs images of xz tau and the 2004 acs images of hd 225213 were not fit in this manner because the stars were saturated .",
    "the 1995 measurements were derived using the procedures discussed by krist et al .",
    "the 1998 wf2 star images were merged due to the lower resolution combined with saturation , so no attempts were made to derive photometric or astrometric values , nor were psf subtractions performed . for the 2005 acs images of xz tau ,",
    "tiny tim psfs were manually shifted and normalized until the stars appeared properly subtracted .",
    "because of the limitations of this procedure , it is assumed that the flux and position measurements are significantly worse than for the other epochs , and so the data from this epoch are best used to determine morphological changes .",
    "also , the combination of the polarizers and a different filter ( f606w versus f625w or f675w ) further increases the possible quantitative errors introduced by these measurements .",
    "because the 2004 image of hd 225213 was saturated in the shortest exposure , its photometry was derived by first multiplying the saturated pixels by the number of electrons per full ccd well for that detector location ( gilliland 2004 ) .",
    "we then directly computed the flux within a 1  radius of the star , which fully encompassed the saturated region .",
    "this flux was then corrected by dividing it by the known fraction of psf flux within the aperture to derive the total stellar flux .",
    "the measured flux was used to normalized the star image relative to the xz tau stars prior to psf subtraction .",
    "the derived xz tau stellar brightnesses are given in table 2 .",
    "the broadband fluxes were converted to standard @xmath8 and @xmath16 magnitudes using the synphot synthetic photometry program with input spectra of similar spectral type and extinction as reported for the binary components . following the method described by white & ghez ( 2001 ) ,",
    "the stellar fluxes in the narrowband filters were converted to equivalent widths ( ews ) . the photospheric contribution in each line filter",
    "was estimated by computing the mean @xmath17 flux ratio using synphot with input spectra from a number of stars with similar spectral types and no known emission ( from the bpgs catalog included with synphot ) .",
    "the measured @xmath8 band flux of each xz tau star was multiplied by this ratio and then subtracted from its measured narrowband flux .",
    "the effective rectangular width of each filter , rw@xmath18 was determined from a synphot - produced throughput curve ; these widths are 28.5  ( wfpc2 f656n ) , 63.3  ( wfpc2 f673n ) , 71.9  ( acs f658n ) , and 132.4  ( acs fr656n centered at @xmath12=6730 ) .",
    "the equivalent width is then ew@xmath18 = -rw@xmath19 $ ] .",
    "an additional modification to the white & ghez procedure is made : because an @xmath8 band measurement , @xmath20 contains significant flux from h@xmath0 emission , the @xmath21 value is subtracted from @xmath20 and a new estimate of @xmath22 is obtained .",
    "this loop is repeated a few times until convergence .",
    "the h@xmath0 ews and photosphere - subtracted fluxes are listed in table 2 .",
    "the 1997 ews computed in the first iteration are consistent with those of white & ghez ( 2001 ) .",
    "note that the ews are negative - valued for emission .",
    "a couple of similar derivations for [ s  ii ] produced ews around zero to within the errors , indicating little [ s  ii ] stellar emission , as one would expect .",
    "xz tau a s h@xmath0 emission varies as much as does xz tau b s and with similar ews .",
    "there is no correlation between the xz tau a h@xmath0 ews and @xmath8 magnitudes .",
    "xz tau b shows a rough correlation , with the ews generally lower as @xmath8 becomes brighter .",
    "the relative positions of the binary components at each epoch are given in table 3 .",
    "they have been converted to a geometrically undistorted coordinate system .",
    "previous experiments have shown that the positional accuracy is typically @xmath23 pixels for the psf - fitting method .",
    "the position angles from the 2004 acs images vary among the filters more than expected . for consistency ,",
    "in addition to images taken in our program , we also fitted the f656n , f675w , and f814w images of xz tau that are described by white & ghez ( 2001 ) .",
    "psf - subtracted images of emission features nearest the binary are shown in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "there are significant residuals within 10  15 of the stars and in the diffraction spikes , which are masked to avoid confusion .",
    "the processed images were geometrically corrected and then aligned to the midpoint of the binary and rotated to a common orientation based on the image header parameters .",

    "the n `` inner '' bubble does appear to have different symmetry axis , though because it is clearly interacting with the outer bubbles , this may more likely be due to nonuniform densities in the interface with those bubble rather than with interaction with a flow from xz tau b.      the xz tau outflow has a number of components : the extended northern and southern bubbles , the collimated xz tau a jet ( including knots n2 , n3 , s3 , n5 , s5 , s6 , and s8 ) along pa=15 , and the collimated xz tau b jet ( knots n4 and s4 ) along pa=36 . the broad h@xmath0-a feature is also assumed to be associated with the xz tau a outflow . at each epoch",
    "the distances of the flow features from the binary midpoints ( table 4 ) were measured by visually estimating their centers . for bow - shaped structures like s5",
    "the positions of the forward edges were measured .",
    "because some of the knots and shocks were irregular ( _ e.g. _ s3 ) or changed shape over time ( _ e.g. _ n2 ) , there may be position errors of 005  012 .",
    "also , some knots may not have been unambiguously separated from subtraction residual artifacts .",
    "the motions between epochs were converted to mean projected velocities ( table 5 ) .",
    "the mean velocity of h@xmath0-a was derived by aligning the 1998 wf2 and 2004 acs @xmath8 images to the binary midpoint and then iteratively shifting and subtracting the 1998 image until the feature disappeared .    to accurately measure the velocity of the forward edge of the outer northern bubble , each of the pc1 @xmath8 and acs f625w and f606w images was registered to binary midpoint and then magnified until the forward edge was aligned with itself in the 2002 image , as judged by subtraction ( figure 8) .",

    "the h@xmath0-a feature had a mean velocity of 100 km s@xmath1 between 19992004 .",

    "hirth et al .",
    "( 1997 ) measured a maximum radial velocity of -70 km s@xmath1 at 14 n from the stars in late 1992 .",
    "this likely corresponded to either the the center - brightened outer bubble or the forward edge of the inner bubble .",
    "assuming a tangential outflow velocity of @xmath2140 km s@xmath1 , this implies an inclination of @xmath227from the plane of the sky with the n flow approaching .",
    "the width of the bubble was determined by plotting lines parallel to the jet axis along the bubble edges .",

    "this discrepancy could be caused by gas just outside the visible limb in 2004 beginning to emit in 2005 , creating an apparent acceleration .",
    "given the lack of earlier data , we assume that the n outer bubble s 1995  1998 mean transverse velocity of @xmath48 km s@xmath1 represents its actual radial expansion velocity prior to that period . during this time , the forward edge of the n outer bubble had a measured outward velocity of 130 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the center of the bubble , located 32 from the stars in 1995 , had an apparent velocity along the jet axis of 130 - 65@xmath49 65 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this is considerably less than the @xmath50 km s@xmath1 velocity of the xz tau a jet ( as measured by knot n2 ) .",

    "these diffuse patches are difficult to identify in individual images .",
    "their velocity is about half that of the forward edge , and in the magnified image sequence , where the forward edge is aligned , they appear to move backwards from it .",

    "h@xmath0 emission clearly dominates in the rapidly appearing and disappearing shocks created by the fast xz tau a jet ( e.g. n3 , s5 , s6 ) .",
    "the remainder of the nebulae emit in more equal parts of h@xmath0 and [ s  ii ] , including the slower xz tau b jet knots .",

    "both lines together account for only about half of the total outer bubble flux measured in the @xmath8 band image , so it is likely that there is significant emission from [ o  i ] ( 6300  ) and/or [ n  ii ] ( 6548  ) ( [ o  i ] indicates lower excitation gas than [ n  ii ] , which is comparable to [ s  ii ] ) .    the lower resolution wfpc2 @xmath10 band ( f439w ) image from december 1998 ( figure 3 ) shows emission along the forward edge of the outer bubble and in knot n3 .",
    "the most prominent hh emission lines included in the f439w bandpass are [ s  ii ] 4069 , 4076   and the h@xmath53 line ( solf et al .",
    "however , three months later , there was no sign of n3 in the pc1 [ s  ii ] 6717 + 6731 image but it was bright in h@xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that the f439w emission may have primarily been h@xmath53 , corresponding to a @xmath2 100 km s@xmath1 shock .",
    "the fluxes of the compact knots and bow shocks in the narrowband images were measured using visually - defined irregular apertures after subtraction of the local background measured in adjacent regions . because of the changing shape of the features , these fluxes are assumed to be rough measures with errors for the fainter knots approaching 50% .",

    "it is clear that xz tau a is the dominant outflow source in the system , which is suprising given that xz tau b is much more photometrically variable and has a more prominent emission line spectrum .",

    "it is clear that the n bubble has encountered material dense enough to decelerate and deform its forward edge , creating the cusps .",
    "the faintness and relative simplicity of the s bubble suggest that it is expanding into a more rarified and uniform medium than the northern one .",
    "coffey et al . ( 2004 ) studied the 1995  2001 epochs from our dataset and suggested that xz tau b was an eruptive , exor - type star based on its spectral lines and photometric variability and thus was the likely source of the bubbles . without using psf - subtracted images or tracing knot motions through later epochs , they did not recognize that both stars have jets and that the bubbles are aligned with the xz tau a jet .",
    "they modeled the formation of the outer bubble as the result of a 250 km s@xmath1 stellar wind with an opening angle of 22 , with the collimated jet having no significant effect .",
    "this scenario , however , does not suitably explain the appearance of the bubble in 1995 , the multiple bubbles and their curvatures , or the finite apparent length of the northern outflow . the interaction of slow and fast moving knots from xz tau a seem to better explain these characteristics .",
    "the extended emission bubbles of xz tauri enclose multiple compact emission knots which attest to the continued flow of bipolar jets after the bubble ejection events .",
    "the position and proper motions of knots n4 and s4 point to xz tau b as their source and a flow pa of 36 .",
    "both steadily brightened by a factor of @xmath25 between 2000 and 2004 .",
    "all of the other observed knots are associated with the jet from xz tau a along pa 15 , and show more transient brightness variation . on timescales of just a year or two , knots n1 , n2 , n3 , and s3 completely faded from view .",
    "this requires relatively high gas densities within the knots so that rapid cooling and recombination can take place .",
    "conversely , s5 and s6 appeared suddenly in 2004 as the brightest and fastest - moving knots in the entire outflow , but were entirely absent two years previously .",
    "the jet s encounter with a sharp density discontinuity in the pre - shock medium at this epoch ( likely a structure in the wake of prior ejections ) would account for this .",
    "s5 appears the most bowshock - like of all the jet knots , showing both extended curved wings and a bright spot at its apex .",
    "numerical simulations of herbig - haro jets tend to focus on the structure of the classical jet / bowshock working surface at large propagation distances from the outflow source . for comparision to the xz tau bubbles , simulations of a very young pulsed jet",
    "are needed in the region very close to the outflow source .",
    "we have begun to explore such models using a third - order weno ( weighted essentially non - oscillatory ) method ( shu 1995 ) for supersonic astrophysical flow simulations ( ha et al . 2005 ) .",
    "weno schemes are high - order finite difference methods designed for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws with piecewise smooth solutions containing sharp discontinuities like shock waves and contacts .",
    "locally smooth stencils are chosen via a nonlinear adaptive algorithm to avoid crossing discontinuities whenever possible in the interpolation procedure .",
    "the weighted eno ( weno ) schemes use a convex combination of all candidate stencils , rather than just one as in the original eno method .",
    "lccc gas density & h atoms @xmath105 & 500 & 50 + gas velocity & km s@xmath1 & 200 & 0 + gas temperature & k & 1000 & 10000 + sound speed & km s@xmath1 & 3.8 & 12 +    we simulated an approximation to the northern jet outflow and a pair of expanding bubbles , including the effects of radiative cooling using the cooling function from figure 8 of schmutzler & tscharnuter ( 1993 ) .",
    "two - dimensional simulations were performed on a @xmath106 grid spanning @xmath107 km on each side .",
    "the jet has a width of @xmath108 km , and inflows at mach 15 with respect to the sound speed in the light ambient gas and mach 55 with respect to its own internal soundspeed .",
    "other flow parameters of the simulation are summarized in table 8 , and atomic gas ( @xmath109 ) is assumed . the leading edge of the resulting outer bubble propagates initially at 150 km s@xmath1 , decaying to 90 km s@xmath1 at 24 years , with an average velocity over this period of 120 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the jet was pulsed : a first pulse was turned on for 0.4 yr , and then the jet inflow was turned off for 8.6 yr while the first pulse propagated .",
    "next a second pulse was turned on for 0.4 yr creating a second bubble , and then the jet inflow was turned off for 5.6 yr .",
    "figure 12a depicts the flow after the two initial pulses .",
    "a third pulse was turned on for 0.4 yr , and the jet inflow was turned off for 5.6 yr ; finally a fourth pulse was turned on for 0.4 yr , and then the jet inflow was turned off for 2.6 yr .",
    "figure 12b depicts the flow after the fourth pulse .",
    "the third and fourth pulses create internal shocks _ within _ the bubbles that formed from the first and second bubbles .",
    "the third pulse has almost merged with the second pulse and the third pulse has just propagated into the first bubble at 24 yr .",
    "these simulations produce limb - brightened bubbles and internal knots like those seen on the n side of the outflow from xz tau a , supporting the idea that a jet pulsed by strong velocity variations is the basic underlying mechanism of the flow .",
    "the diameter of the simulated bubbles agrees with the hubble images : roughly @xmath110 km ( @xmath2 3 ) .",
    "a wide - angle wind is not necessary to match the morphology of the imaged flows .",
    "several model details remain unoptimized , however : the initially static ambient medium makes the shock in the outer bubble stronger and less spherically symmetric than seen in xz tau ; the jet width in the simulations is oversized compared to the knots observed in the hst images ; and we do not yet have specific predictions for the optical emission line fluxes .",
    "our multiepoch _ hst _ observations of the young xz tau binary reveal a more complex system of outflows than was previously suspected .",
    "both stars have collimated , bipolar jets as shown by the motions of compact knots .",
    "the knots in the xz tau a jet , which is oriented along pa=15 , have tangential velocities of 80  200 km sec@xmath1 .",
    "this jet is assumed to be inclined by @xmath227from the plane of the sky .",
    "it can be traced to 19  to the south where it apparently impacts the edge of an interstellar cloud , creating a broad shock ( h@xmath0-a ) that travels at 100 km sec@xmath1 .",
    "the xz tau a jet knots show a surprising variety of forms , including fans , bow shocks , and shells , some of which suddenly appear and then fade away with a year or two .",
    "the more sedate xz tau b jet is defined by a pair of knots aligned along pa=36with velocities of 40  125 km sec@xmath1 . although xz tau b is more photometrically variable and has richer spectral features than xz tau a , it is not the primary outflow driver as was previously assumed .",
    "the most unusual aspect of the xz tau outflow is the series of bipolar bubbles that are aligned with the xz tau a jet .",
    "the outermost bubble in the northern outflow extended to 61 from the star and was 45 wide in early 2005 .",
    "the tangential velocity of its forward edge was @xmath2130 km sec@xmath1 prior to 1999 , and it slowed to @xmath293 km sec@xmath1 by 2002 , presumably due to interaction with the surrounding medium .",
    "at later epochs the outer edge became deformed and fragmented .",
    "its transverse velocity of 46  76 km sec@xmath1 is probably indicative of the true expansion velocity from its center , which by derivation has a forward velocity of @xmath265 km sec@xmath1 along the jet .",
    "the bubble was dominated by interior emission in 1995 , but in later epochs it appeared limb brightened due to cooling and the resulting recombination emission .",
    "the northern extension of the xz tau a jet appears to terminate at the forward edge of the bubble where it brightens due to the impact with the same ism material that is slowing the bubble .",
    "two additional bubbles trail the outer one and appear to overlap it .",
    "the one closest to the stars appears as a nearly circular shell with strong limb brightening , while the intermediate bubble is fainter with strong brightening along its forward edge .",
    "another , more circular and more uniformly illuminated bubble appears on the southern side of the stars in the 2004 acs images .",
    "the bubbles do not appear similar to the typical bow shocks seen in the jets of other young stars and must have a different origin .",
    "notably , the outer bubble was a filled volume of emitting gas in 1995 , not a limb - brightened bow shock .",
    "the form and expansion velocity of the outer bubble suggests that it may have been created by a very hot and dense shock generated close to the star .",
    "the shock may have rapidly expanded until it transitioned to a ballistically expanding bubble .",
    "recombination within the cooling interior would cause the emission seen in 1995 .",
    "density enhancement along the outer boundary may have accelerated the cooling , creating additional emission seen along the limb after then .",
    "additional interactions of the xz tau a jet with the bubble material may have created the trailing bubbles .",
    "the southern bubble may have formed at the same time in a bipolar outburst , but because of a possibly less - dense external medium it appears more uniform .",
    "xz tau presents a unique collection of unusual outflow phenomena that vary considerably on timescales and distances that can be observed using the capabilities of _ hst_. it represents a test of the ability of current methods of jet modeling .",
    "this research has made use of the hubble space telescope , operated by the space telescope science institute under a contract with nasa .",
