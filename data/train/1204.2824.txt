    "the tight observed relationship between galaxy bulge mass and the mass of its central , supermassive black hole ( smbh ; e.g. , @xcite ) , hereafter @xmath8@xmath9 , suggests galaxy growth ( i.e. , star - formation ) is closely tied to the principal mode of smbh growth : accretion during periods of nuclear activity ( i.e. , active galactic nuclei , or agn ) .",
    "however , the @xmath8@xmath9  relationship only provides a snapshot of the end result , with the details surrounding when , how and under what conditions these links were forged remaining poorly understood .",
    "indeed , it is not yet clear whether _ all _ episodes of star - formation are eventually accompanied by smbh growth , or whether such evolutionary links are limited to the most rapidly growing systems , such as those induced by major - mergers ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "a major difficulty in exploring the links between ongoing smbh and galaxy growth stems partly from scatter introduced by the different duty cycles of agn and star - formation episodes , leading to what appears to be only very weak correlations between the two events ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since smbh growth appears to be so closely tied to galaxy growth , it is pertinent to ask whether average smbh accretion rates trace star - formation rates ( sfrs ) . in this vein",
    ", @xcite showed that the ratio of average smbh accretion rate to sfr in star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) at @xmath1 was roughly consistent with that inferred from today s @xmath8@xmath9  relationship .",
    "however , focussing on only the global average conceals details of how smbh and galaxy mass is built up .",
    "indeed , it is now evident that sfgs have formed stars at a rate that is roughly proportional to their stellar masses ( @xmath2 ) since at least @xmath1 , while their average specific sfrs ( i.e. , @xmath10/@xmath2 ) increase strongly with redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here , we determine whether these trends between sfr , @xmath2  and redshift for sfgs also extend to the growth of their resident smbhs .",
    "we use @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and a chabrier initial mass function .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we measure the average smbh accretion rates in sfgs at @xmath14 in the goods - south field .",
    "our two samples of @xmath0 and @xmath1 galaxies ( 607 and 1146 sources , respectively ) are from the k - selected catalogue of @xcite ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for details of the @xmath0 sample ) .",
    "sfrs for these galaxies are based on 24  @xmath15  and uv observations , respectively , and are known to be unbiased on average ( @xcite ) .",
    "both samples were divided into the same set of stellar mass ( @xmath2 ) bins .",
    "the average sfr of sfgs in these bins , plotted as a function of @xmath2 , is shown in fig .",
    ". the shallower slope of the @xmath0 sfr@xmath2  relation compared to the @xmath1 sample is due to an eddington bias introduced by the flux limit of the 24  @xmath15  data used to estimate their sfrs . by comparing like - for - like average x - ray emission ( and inferred smbh accretion rates ) with average sfrs and using the sfgs as priors for our x - ray matching / stacking we",
    "ensure that this bias has no effect on our results .",
    "the x - ray data used for this study were taken from the 4  ms _ chandra _ deep - field observations ( cycle 9 ddt ; see @xcite for details ) , which entirely cover our sfg samples . to determine the average level of smbh accretion taking place in the sfgs we account for x - ray non - detections as well as x - ray detections .",
    "first , we used positional matching to identify those galaxies detected in x - rays , matching to the optical positions reported in @xcite and assuming a matching radius of 1 .",
    "the numbers of identified matches in each of our @xmath2  and redshift bins are given in table [ stats ] .",
    "for the remainder , we stacked the x - ray data at the optical positions of the sfgs , taking care to avoid detected sources and only stacking within 8  of the average aim - point of the _ chandra _ observations . for each of our redshift and mass bins",
    "the total ( i.e. , detected @xmath16 undetected ) x - ray counts are dominated by the x - ray detected sources .",
    "average count rates were determined by summing the counts from the detected sources and the stacks then dividing this by the total effective exposure times ( of both detected and undetected sources ) .",
    "average band ratios , fluxes at the observed - frame 2 - 10  kev band and obscuration - corrected luminosities at a rest - frame 2 - 10  kev band ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) were calculated using the methodology outlined in @xcite which uses band - ratios to correct for obscuration ( see our table [ stats ] ) .",
    "the average contribution to @xmath17  from star - formation was calculated using two different sfr-@xmath17  relations ( from @xcite and @xcite ) and subtracted to leave the intrinsic @xmath17  of the agn .",
    "both relations estimate a non - agn contribution of @xmath18 in each of our mass and redshift bins , meaning this correction has no significant impact on our results .",
    "once the average intrinsic x - ray luminosities had been estimated for the sfgs in each of our @xmath2  and redshift bins , we used this information to estimate average agn bolometric luminosities ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we derive our main results using a constant bolometric correction factor of 22.4 to convert @xmath17  to @xmath19  ( the median bolometric correction factor of a sample of local , @xmath17@xmath20  @xmath21  agn from @xcite ) . from @xmath19we",
    "derive smbh accretion rates ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) using :    @xmath22     + where @xmath23 is the speed of light in a vacuum and @xmath24 is the efficiency by which mass is converted into radiated energy via the accretion process . here",
    "we assume @xmath25 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or that roughly 10% of mass within the accreting system is converted into energy that is radiated away via electromagnetic radiation , irrespective of @xmath8 .",
    "as the number of x - ray counts for each bin is dominated ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) by x - ray detected sources , uncertainties on the mean @xmath17were calculated using a bootstrapping technique ; repeatedly selecting 2/3 of the detected sample in each bin at random and calculating the dispersion of the resulting @xmath17  distribution .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath19  and @xmath3  were then propagated from our estimates of the uncertainties on the mean @xmath17 .",
    "in fig . [ lx_m]b we plot the average @xmath17  of x - ray detected @xmath16 undetected ( i.e. , stacked ) sfgs as a function of @xmath2  for our two redshift samples . both our @xmath0 and @xmath1 samples show a clear increase in their average @xmath17  with increasing @xmath2  for the mass range considered .",
    "this is in contrast to studies of individually detected x - ray agn which find no such correlation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is only when the scatter in @xmath17  due to agn variability is averaged - out that the correlation between @xmath17  and @xmath2  for sfgs presents itself .",
    "a least - squares fit to these data gives @xmath17@xmath4@xmath2@xmath5 for the @xmath0 sample and @xmath17@xmath4@xmath2@xmath6 for the @xmath1 sample .",
    "as we neglect the ( unknown ) possible variations of accretion efficiencies and bolometric corrections with stellar masses , @xmath17  can be directly replaced by @xmath3  in these equations to give the same relationships between @xmath3  and @xmath2 .",
    "importantly , we also find that the average @xmath17  of sfgs increases with redshift , being a factor of @xmath27 higher , on average , at @xmath1 compared to @xmath0 .",
    "this is comparable to the factor of @xmath28 higher average sfrs of the @xmath1 sample .    to demonstrate this last point we have included in our @xmath17-@xmath2  plot ( fig .",
    "[ lx_m]b ) the observed trend between sfr and @xmath2  derived from our two samples of sfgs ( i.e. , sfr@xmath4@xmath2@xmath29 and sfr@xmath4@xmath2@xmath30 for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 populations , respectively ) , normalised to fit the average inferred @xmath3  of the respective redshift sample but maintaining the gradient .",
    "plotting @xmath3/sfr as a function of @xmath2  ( fig .",
    "[ lx_m]c ) we find this ratio is only marginally dependent on @xmath2  and is strikingly similar for our @xmath0 and @xmath1 samples ( i.e. , @xmath3/sfr  @xmath4  @xmath2@xmath31 and @xmath3/sfr  @xmath4  @xmath2@xmath32 for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 samples , respectively ) .",
    "furthermore , the uncertainties are consistent with a flat @xmath3/sfr ratio with respect to @xmath2  for both samples ( i.e. , @xmath3  @xmath33\\times10^{-3}\\cdot$]sfr for our @xmath0 sample and @xmath3  @xmath34\\times10^{-3}\\cdot$]sfr for our @xmath1 sample ) . adopting a luminosity - dependent bolometric correction factor from @xcite",
    "gives @xmath3/sfr  @xmath4  @xmath2@xmath35 for both redshift bins ; the error - bars remain consistent with a flat distribution . ]    by taking the average x - ray output of sfgs it follows that the ensemble growth rate of smbhs increases with both increasing @xmath2and redshift in a manner that is remarkably similar to the average levels of star - formation taking place in sfgs .",
    "the independence of the average @xmath3/sfr ratio on @xmath2  implies its constancy during the rapid growth phases of galaxies .",
    "next , we consider how this constant ratio conforms to our understanding of relative smbh growth both locally and at high redshifts .",
    "the mass of a smbh today , at redshift @xmath36 , can be described in terms of its total accretion history since @xmath37 and its mass at @xmath37 , i.e. , of stellar - mass build - up ( @xcite ) . ]",
    "@xmath38    our observations support a constant average ratio between the smbh and galaxy growth rates , i.e. , @xmath39 . ] replacing the resulting integral with @xmath40 , we obtain , @xmath41 similarly , the stellar mass of the host galaxy at @xmath42 is given by , @xmath43 so the black hole to stellar mass ratio is given by , @xmath44 defining @xmath45 as the initial @xmath8  to @xmath2  ratio ( relative to the growth rate ratio , i.e. , @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 as the relative change in @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath48 we obtain , @xmath49 thus , as soon as enough activity has taken place so that the ( uncertain ) initial conditions can be neglected , one expects constant @xmath8  to @xmath2  ratios independent of redshift and roughly equal to the observed growth rate ratio .",
    "it is not surprising then that the growth ratios are close to the smbh to stellar mass ratio inferred from today s @xmath8@xmath9  relationship , indicating that this relative growth rate is crucial in defining these ratios .",
    "our results suggest that it is coeval growth at constant relative rates averaged over cosmological timescales that produces the links between smbh and stellar mass inferred from the @xmath8@xmath9relation . to address this in more detail",
    "there are a number of points that should be considered carefully .",
    "first , we emphasise that our results are cosmologically relevant , referring to the bulk of the smbh and galaxy growth .",
    "the @xmath14 epoch spanned by our samples correspond to the vast majority of both global star ( e.g. , @xcite ) and smbh ( e.g. , @xcite ) formation history .",
    "likewise , although we miss the most luminous agn their absence will not change our results . integrating the `` lade '' agn x - ray luminosity function of @xcite",
    ", we estimate that @xmath502030%  of all smbh accretion at @xmath14 takes place in agns that are rare enough such that @xmath51 would be expected to be found in our survey ( i.e. , rarer than three per @xmath52 at @xmath0 and three per @xmath53 at @xmath1 , corresponding to @xmath17@xmath54  @xmath21and @xmath17@xmath55  @xmath21 , respectively ) .",
    "similarly , we could miss @xmath56 of the sfr density because of volume effects .",
    "we note that the fraction of agns in low - sfr galaxies not included in our sfg sample is also negligible at these redshifts , being @xmath57% ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "obscuration is a potentially more serious issue , as we will underestimate the contribution of the heavily obscured ( i.e. , compton - thick ) agns thought to be responsible for @xmath5850%  of total smbh growth ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this could introduce a factor of @xmath59 correction , but is unlikely to be substantially larger than the observed , unobscured contribution .",
    "obscuration due to orientation effects ( unified model ) is unlikely to depend strongly on either mass or redshift and , as such , will not affect the observed correlations .",
    "it is unclear whether the levels of obscuration due to merger driven starbursts changes as a function of galaxy mass and/or redshift .",
    "however , the fraction of starbursts does not appear to change significantly with redshift or galaxy mass and accounts for only 1015% of all star - formation ( at least for the ranges considered here ; @xcite ) .",
    "this obscured agn fraction , together with the fact that a fraction of the stars forming will quickly die due to stellar evolution , leads us to conclude that our results support a constant @xmath8  to @xmath2  ratio of :      at @xmath14  consistent with the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this ratio is also consistent with the local @xmath8/@xmath9  ratio , suggesting that it is the same relation . at this point",
    "it is important to note that , while there is some evidence to suggest that today s",
    "@xmath8  correlates most tightly with bulge mass ( @xcite ) , for the sake of this letter we do not distinguish between galaxy and bulge mass / sfr as it is impossible to reliably determine which of the stars formed at @xmath61 will be in bulges by @xmath62 .",
    "having said that , it is thought the the majority of stars formed at these high redshifts in the @xmath2  range considered will collapse to form massive bulges by @xmath62 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , probably due to the effects of mergers .",
    "using eqn .",
    "( [ mag ] ) we can compute approximate smbh masses for our galaxy samples . since the @xmath3  to sfr ratio has remained consistent with the smbh and galaxy mass ratio since @xmath1 the specific smbh growth rate ( i.e. , @xmath63@xmath64 ) traces the same trend with redshift as the average ssfrs of sfgs ( e.g. , @xcite ; fig .",
    "[ smdot ] ) .",
    "thus , when doing ensemble ( i.e. , time ) averages , the smbh population forms an `` agn main - sequence '' ( where roughly @xmath3@xmath4@xmath8 , on average ) that follows the same trends with stellar mass and redshift as the so - called galactic main sequence of e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to interpret these results in terms of the frequency of nuclear and star - forming activity in galaxies .",
    "for this , we consider the distribution of agn eddington ratios ( @xmath65@xmath4@xmath3/@xmath8 ) and galaxy ssfrs .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that the @xmath65  distribution of x - ray agns can be described purely as a function of @xmath65  and redshift ; i.e. , independently of @xmath2  ( fig .",
    "[ growthsketch]a ) .  distributions .",
    "however , by selection , those agns have considerably higher average @xmath19  ( @xmath66  l@xmath67 ; e.g. , @xcite ) than our samples and , as such , are less directly relevant to our analyses . ]",
    "this broad distribution for agns , which spans over four orders of magnitude in @xmath65  ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) , contrasts with the distribution of ssfr of galaxies that is remarkably narrow , yet also independent of @xmath2(@xcite ; fig .",
    "[ growthsketch]a ) .",
    "this is the main reason why the agn main sequence remains hidden ; there are strong changes in @xmath63  compared to minor changes in the ssfrs of galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ growthsketch ] ) .",
    "this has the implication that outliers should exist in the @xmath8-@xmath2  relation when the smbh growth has taken advantage over the @xmath2  growth and vice versa , in qualitative agreement with observations ( e.g. , @xcite ; also @xcite ) .    the rise of the specific growth of galaxies with redshift has recently been attributed to the strong increase in the gas fractions of galaxies from @xmath68 to 2 ( @xcite ) . given that the cosmological growth rate between smbhs and @xmath2  remains roughly constant , it seems that gas fractions also play an important role in driving smbh growth during this epoch .",
    "however , clarifying the physical processes ( feedback , volume effects , etc . ) that set @xmath3/sfr @xmath7 and determine how gas fraction translates to different ssfr and @xmath63  distributions ( fig .",
    "[ growthsketch]a ) remains an open issue that is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "our results provide insights into how the relationships between smbhs and their host galaxies are forged . the vast majority ( i.e. , @xmath6998% ) of galaxies that form our parent sample are main - sequence ( ms ) sfgs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "morphological and dynamical studies do find evidence of mergers among these galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but being on the ms ( @xcite ) implies their star - formation is not strongly enhanced by these interactions ( @xcite ) .",
    "such ms galaxies are responsible for @xmath6990%(@xcite ) of all star - formation taking place during this epoch .",
    "of course , the most massive , distant galaxies and smbhs probed here will have grown their mass at earlier times when other processes  such as major - mergers  may have played a more dominant role .",
    "however , for sfgs to have @xmath70 during the time when the bulk of today s stellar and smbh mass was built - up implies that a significant fraction of all smbh growth takes place in ms galaxies whose sfrs are not enhanced by mergers .",
    "this view is consistent with recent studies of the and morphologies of x - ray selected agn hosts which find that the agn population is dominated by non - mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , results from recent hydrodynamical models ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggest that it is possible to have efficient smbh accretion inside gas rich , high redshift clumpy galaxies , without invoking galaxy - galaxy interactions or mergers ."
