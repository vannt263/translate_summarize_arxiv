    "[ [ section ] ]    the space - borne egret _ ( energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ) _ detector on board the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ discovered strong mev and gev @xmath0-ray emission from 66 blazars , mainly from flat spectrum radio quasars and unidentified flat spectrum radio sources @xcite .",
    "ground - based cherenkov telescopes discovered tev @xmath0-ray emission from seven blazars , five of which were not detected by egret @xcite . although @xmath0-ray emission from blazars have been studied for more than a decade now , it is still unclear where and how the emission originates . according to the most common paradigm , the emission originates close to a mass - accreting supermassive black hole , in a relativistically moving collimated plasma outflow ( jet ) that is aligned with the line of sight to within a few degrees .",
    "the relativistic doppler effect can explain the intensity of the blazar emission , and its rapid variability at x - rays and @xmath0-ray energies on hour time scales : for emission originating from synchrotron or synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) models , the apparent luminosity increases approximately as the fourth power of the relativistic doppler factor @xmath3^{-1}$ ] with @xmath4 , the bulk lorentz factor of the jet plasma , @xmath5 , the angle between jet axis and the line of sight , and @xmath6 , the plasma velocity , in units of the speed of light . ] @xmath7 , and the observed flux variability timescale is inversely proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "blazars are powerful sources across the electromagnetic spectrum",
    ". typical spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for the high energy peaked tev blazars show two broad peaks , one at infrared to x - ray energies and the other at x - ray to @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "the low - energy peak is commonly believed to originate as synchrotron emission from a population of relativistic electrons gyrating in the magnetic field of the jet plasma .",
    "the origin of the high - energy peak is unproven .",
    "the commonly adopted and best studied models assume that the @xmath0-rays are produced in inverse compton processes by the same electrons that emit the synchrotron radiation at longer wavelengths ( for a recent review of observations and models , see @xcite ) . in so - called hadronic models ,",
    "@xmath0-rays are emitted as synchrotron radiation of extremely energetic protons @xcite , as inverse compton and synchrotron emission from a proton induced cascade ( pic ) @xcite , or from @xmath8 @xmath9 decays following the interaction of high energy protons with some target material @xcite .",
    "recent reviews on observations of blazars with tev emission and models developed to describe the data can be found in various review articles and books @xcite .",
    "reviews focussing on observations and models of sources with mev / gev emission can be found in @xcite .",
    "broader overviews of the field of tev @xmath0-ray astronomy are given in @xcite .",
    "multiwavelength observations are key for understanding the blazar phenomenon .",
    "the acquisition of good multiwavelength data sets has encountered substantial difficulties as the sensitivities of current tev observatories require flares for sampling the tev light curves on a time scale of hours .",
    "some sources were observed with excellent multiwavelength coverage but during relatively unspectacular quiescent phases ; in other cases , the sources were flaring , but the fluxes were only poorly sampled in frequency space and in time .",
    "the most remarkable result from the multiwavelength campaigns is that there is good evidence for a correlation between the x - ray fluxes and the tev @xmath0-ray fluxes for the two sources mrk 421 @xcite and mrk 501 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present results from a multiwavelength campaign on the tev blazar markarian ( mrk ) 421 .",
    "the source is a nearby ( z = 0.031 ) high energy - peaked bl lac object , and was the first extragalactic source detected in the tev @xmath0-ray band @xcite . in november 2002 ,",
    "@xmath0-ray observations with the whipple 10  m telescope revealed several mrk 421 flares with fluxes exceeding three times the steady flux from the crab nebula .",
    "the all sky monitor instrument aboard _",
    "rxte _ also showed extremely strong 2 - 12 kev fluxes reaching 100 milli - crab .",
    "collectively these triggered a coordinated campaign .",
    "we invoked radio , optical , and x - ray ( _ rxte _ ) observations to commence as soon as the waning moon would allow the cherenkov telescope to take data once more .",
    "although the x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray fluxes had decreased substantially when the campaign started on december 4th , we acquired a data set with a high signal - to - noise - ratio x - ray light curve and x - ray energy spectra , and good signal - to - noise - ratio tev light curves and tev @xmath0-ray energy spectra .",
    "the combined data allowed us to study the x - ray / tev @xmath0-ray flux correlation over several weeks .",
    "following our previous study @xcite , this is the second campaign that measures the x - ray / tev @xmath0-ray flux correlation over several weekes .",
    "for the first time , we use here simulated lightcurves to address the statistical significance of the x - ray / tev @xmath0-ray flux correlation and to constrain the time lag between the two light curves .",
    "simulations are necessary as subsequent data points in the light curve are not independent of each other ( see e.g. , the discussion by @xcite ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows.after describing the data sets in section 2 , we explain the method that we used to reconstruct tev @xmath0-ray energy spectra from the whipple data , and give the results obtained with the method in section 3 .",
    "subsequently , we present the results of the campaign in section 4 , and conclude with a summary and a discussion in section 5 . if not mentioned otherwise , errors are quoted on the level of one standard deviation , and upper limits are given on 90% confidence level .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    we used the university of michigan equatorially mounted 26-meter paraboloid in its automatic observation mode to observe mrk 421 at 4.8 ghz , 8.0 ghz and 14.5 ghz between december 3 , 2002 and january 10 , 2003 . both linear polarization and total flux density measurements",
    "were made , but only the total flux density measurements are reported here .",
    "each observation consisted of a series of five - minute on - off type measurements over a 40-minute time period interleaved with observations of other program sources .",
    "observations were restricted to within three hours of the local meridian to minimize instrumental errors .",
    "the telescope pointing corrections are interpolated from position scans through sources stronger than 2-janskys .",
    "the flux density measurements have been corrected to the baars flux density calibration scale @xcite using observations of a grid of calibrator sources , distributed around the sky , which were observed at approximately two - hour intervals .",
    "the @xmath10 error bars include both the estimated measurement and calibration uncertainties .",
    "the observation and calibration procedures have been described in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    in the following , we will discuss three optical data sets .",
    "the first was taken at the boltwood observatory ( stittsville , ontario , canada ) with a 0.4  m telescope , a site 502a ccd chip , and a johnson - cousins r filter .",
    "the data were collected for @xmath11 10 days between december 3 , 2002 and january 12 , 2003 .",
    "relative aperture photometry was performed with an aperture of 10 arcsec and `` star 1 '' from @xcite as the comparison star .",
    "the background was estimated using a concentric annulus with a diameter between 37 and 44 arcsec .",
    "we did not subtract the light from the host - galaxy . usually , five two - minute exposures were integrated before deriving the photometric value .",
    "the typical statistical error on the relative photometry is 0.02 mag .",
    "the analysis is compromised by two very bright stars near mrk 421 that cause a varying level of light to spill into the source and background regions . based on previous optical results on the same source and stars in the field of view",
    ", we estimate that photometric measurements have a systematic error of 0.08 mag per data point .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    the second set of optical observations were made using a 35  cm celestron telescope installed on the tube of the 60  cm kva telescope ( la palma , spain ) .",
    "the observations were made with the st-8 ccd using a standard kron / cousins r - filter .",
    "the analysis used the reduction programs developed by kari nilsson ( tuorla observatory ) with the reference stars one and two from @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    the final set of optical data were collected using the wiyn 0.9 m telescope at kpno with the s2 kb ccd imager using a harris v - filter .",
    "the data were collected from 6 december 2002 to 15 january 2003 ( with , however , a large gap 9 dec 2002 to 3 jan 2003 ) .",
    "relative aperature photometry was performed using standard iraf routines with an aperature of 6 arcsec , sky annulus ranging from 27 to 30 arcsec in diameter , and `` star 1 '' of @xcite as the comparison star .",
    "again , we did not subtract light from the host galaxy .",
    "typical statistical errors from the photometric fits were smaller than 0.005 mag . based on the spread in magnitude difference between two reference stars , we estimate the uncertainty for each data point to be 0.02 mag for the purpose of determining variability . with regard to the absolute flux , due to the presence of host - galaxy light , we expect the values reported to contain an undetermined systematic offset of as much as 0.1 mag",
    ". optical magnitudes for all three data sets are converted to absolute fluxes according to @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    we reduced the data from the _ rxte _ proportional counter array with the standard _ rxte _ data analysis software .",
    "standard-2 mode pca data taken with the top layer of the operational proportional counter units ( pcus ) were analyzed .",
    "the number of pcus operational during a pointing varied between 2 and 4 .",
    "we restricted the spectral analysis to the energy range from 4 kev to 15 kev .",
    "we excluded data below 4 kev , as the analysis of earlier _ rxte _ data showed corrupted behavior ( exceptionally high or low count rates of individual bins not compatible with the energy resolution of the instrument ) .",
    "we find that the data of most pointings are dominated by background above 15 kev . after applying the standard screening criteria ( including visual inspection of the electron rate ) and removing abnormal data spikes , the net exposure in each good time interval ranged from 168 sec to 9.01 ksec .",
    "light - curves were then extracted with ` ftools ` v5.3.2 .",
    "background models were generated with the tool ` pcabackest ` , based on the _ _ rxte _ _ gof calibration files for a `` bright '' source ( more than 40 counts / sec / pcu ) .",
    "response matrices for the pca data were created with the script ` pcarsp ` v.10.1 .",
    "the pcu `` pcu0 '' was not excluded for analysis as the ftools version gives the proper background model .",
    "we assume for all fits a galactic neutral hydrogen density of 1.31 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xcite . for each pointing , a power law model was fitted over the energy range from 4  kev to 15  kev .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    we complement the data from the pointed rxte telescopes with data from the rxte all sky monitor ( asm ) @xcite taken between december 2 , 2002 ( ut ) and january 14 , 2003 ( ut ) .",
    "we derived fluxes by averaging the `` summed band intensities '' acquired during one day .",
    "tev observations were taken with the whipple 10 m cherenkov telescope ( mount hopkins , az ) and with the ct1 telescope of the high energy gamma - ray astronomy ( hegra ) collaboration ( la palma , spain ) . in the following paragraphs we describe the two data sets .",
    "the whipple observations were taken between 4 december 2002 ( ut ) and 15 january 2003 ( ut ) .",
    "a total of 44  hrs of data were acquired : 32 hrs on the source , and 12 hrs on an adjacent field for background estimation purposes .",
    "the data were analyzed using the standard `` hillas '' 2@xmath14-moment - parameterization technique @xcite .",
    "standard cuts ( @xmath15 ) were used to select @xmath0-ray events and to suppress background cosmic - ray events @xcite .",
    "the fluxes were normalized to the flux from the crab nebula using a data set of 15 hrs of on - source data and matching background observations taken in december 2002 and january 2003 @xcite . using the zenith angle dependence of this crab data set we account for the zenith angle dependence of the @xmath0-ray excess rate by normalizing our measured mrk421 rate to the crab rate at a corresponding zenith angle .",
    "significances and corresponding error bars were calculated using the method of @xcite .    from monte carlo simulations , we fold the crab spectrum with the instrument response to obtain the peak energy ( energy threshold ) for the whipple 10 m data to be consistent with the value 400 gev derived elsewhere @xcite . more detailed descriptions of whipple observing modes and analysis procedures can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "details about the whipple telescope including the granite - iii camera have been given in @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    a second tev @xmath0-ray data set was acquired with the hegra ct1 telescpe ( see @xcite for a description of the ct1 instrument ) between 3 november 2002 and 12 december 2002 . the telescope was equipped with a 127 pixel camera with a 3 degree diameter field of view , and with all - aluminum mirrors giving a total of @xmath16 reflecting surface @xcite .",
    "the analysis used 17 hrs of data with zenith angles between 12@xmath17 and 58@xmath17 .",
    "the hegra ct1 data were normalized to the crab flux in a similar way as the whipple data , taking into account the zenith angle dependence of the excess rate .",
    "we estimate a mean energy threshold for the ct1 data set of approximately 700 gev .",
    "[ [ section-8 ] ]    the normalization to the steady crab flux is a convenient way to combine data from different instruments to avoid systematic errors resulting from errors in the absolute flux calibration of each instrument , and to perform a first - order correction for variations in rate with zenith angle .",
    "the drawback of the method is that the different energy thresholds of the whipple and hegra observations can introduce a normalization error if the source energy spectrum deviates from the crab energy spectrum . using previous measurements of the mrk 421 tev spectral index as a function of flux level",
    ", we estimate that the whipple / hegra normalization error is always smaller than 30% .",
    "the spectral analysis of the whipple tev @xmath0-ray data used a different set of gamma - hadron separation cuts that minimize the systematic error associated with uncertainties in the @xmath0-ray selection efficiency of the cuts while still giving a good sensitivity .",
    "the `` extended zenith angle scaled cuts '' @xcite select primary @xmath0-rays with an efficiency that is largely independent of the zenith angle of the observation and the energy of the primary photon .",
    "the analysis is based on the grinnell - isu ( grisu ) package that uses the kascade airshower simulation code @xcite , followed by the simulation of the cherenkov light emitted by the air shower and the simulation of the detector response . to calibrate the overall gain of the whipple 10 m telescope in the simulations , we compared simulated and observed muon events .",
    "muons show up as bright arcs of cherenkov light in the camera and are useful for calibration because the light per unit arc length is nearly constant , regardless of the impact parameter and angle of the muon trajectory .",
    "the overall gain of the telescope can be found by comparing the distribution of the signal per arc length in a simulated set of muon events and in an observed set .",
    "we took the simulated muon events from a sample of simulated proton and helium showers .",
    "muons are identified with a dedicated muon identification algorithm that extracts @xmath11200 muon arcs per 28 min data run .",
    "we adjusted the overall gain factor in the simulations until they reproduced the observed signal per arc length distribution .",
    "the overall gain factor agrees to within 15% with the value computed from measurements of the mirror reflectivity , photo - multiplier tube ( pmt ) quantum efficiency , and electronic gain .",
    "we used the forward folding technique to fit the energy spectra .",
    "although earlier tev @xmath0-ray analyses used similar methods , this is the first time that we describe the method in detail . for each cherenkov event that passed the gamma - hadron separation cuts , we computed an estimator @xmath18 of its primary energy , based on the image parameters ` _ size _ ' @xmath19 ( sum of counts in an image ) and ` _ distance _ ' @xmath20 ( distance of the image centroid from the center of the field of view ) : @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "the constants @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath6 , and @xmath35 are given in table [ parameters ] .",
    "the first term in the energy estimator reflects the fact that total intensity of an image ( _ size _ ) is roughly proportional to the energy ( @xmath18 ) of the inducing @xmath0-ray .",
    "the second term corrects this relationship depending on the distance of the telescope from the shower axis ( @xmath20 is proportional to the latter ) . using extended zenith angle cuts",
    ", the energy estimator gives an energy resolution of @xmath36 0.25 .",
    "we limited the spectral analysis to on - source data with associated background data sets ( the so - called on - off data ) taken at zenith angles less than 30@xmath17 .",
    "after histogramming the energy estimator for both the on - source and background regions , the background histogram was subtracted from the on - source histogram .",
    "subsequently , an energy spectrum was fitted to this `` excess histogram '' using the forward folding approach ( see e.g.   @xcite ) , making use of a simulated set of @xmath0-ray showers .",
    "the simulated set of showers consisted of 67,500 showers simulated over an area @xmath37 @xmath38 in the energy range from 50 gev to 25.6 tev over nine energy intervals .",
    "the first energy interval went from 50 to 100 gev , the second from 100 to 200 gev and so forth . in the @xmath39 energy interval",
    ", showers were simulated according to a power law distribution : @xmath40 with @xmath41 2.5 .",
    "simple integration of eq .",
    "[ pl ] gives the normalization constant @xmath42 as function of the lower bound @xmath43 and upper bound @xmath44 of the @xmath39 energy interval and the number @xmath45 of showers simulated in that energy interval : @xmath46    we fit the data with two models , a power law model and a power law model with an exponential high - energy cutoff : @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the flux normalization at 1  tev , @xmath4 is the photon index , and @xmath50 is the high - energy cutoff . for each trial parameter",
    "set @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 or @xmath53 ) , another histogram is filled with weighted @xmath0-ray showers that pass the @xmath0-ray selection cuts .",
    "the weights are computed according to : @xmath54 where @xmath55 t is the observation time , and @xmath56 is the area over which showers were simulated . the numerator in eq . [ e1 ] gives the model flux for the parameter combination @xmath51 at energy @xmath18 .",
    "the denominator gives the simulated flux .",
    "while the weights depend on the true energy of the simulated @xmath0-rays , the showers are filled into the histogram according to their reconstructed energy .",
    "the weighting saves computational time in the fitting procedure , as only the weights have to be re - computed for each set of model parameters .",
    "[ [ section-9 ] ]    we performed a search in parameter space until the parameter combination @xmath57 is found that minimizes the @xmath58-difference between the observed and simulated histograms .",
    "we determined the 1 @xmath59 error region from the condition @xcite @xmath60    the best fit model parameters and the associated errors are the main results of a spectral analysis . plotting individual data points in an energy spectrum is well known to be an ill - defined problem .",
    "a very good discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "owing to the finite energy resolution of the telescopes , some information about the true energy spectrum is irrevocably lost .",
    "we have experimented with `` deconvolution methods '' , as for example , the backus - gilbert method @xcite .",
    "owing to a combination of almost gaussian distributions of @xmath61 and @xmath62 and the modest signal - to - noise ratios of the tev @xmath0-ray energy spectra , we find that deconvolution methods improve only very little the effective energy resolution .",
    "we thus use the simplest method to plot flux estimates , based on the counts in the excess histogram ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for an energy bin stretching from @xmath63 to @xmath64",
    ", we plot the flux value at the energy @xmath65 10@xmath66 .",
    "the flux value is given by scaling the best - fit model according to the observed number of excess counts : @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the number of excess counts in the i@xmath69 bin of the signal histogram , and @xmath70 is the sum of weights of the simulated events in the i@xmath69 bin .",

    "[ [ section-12 ] ]    the _ rxte _ pcu and asm fluxes seem to trace each other , although the sparse sampling of the pcu data and the large statistical error bars of the asm data do not allow us to draw definitive conclusions .",
    "the optical and radio data show substantial variability by about @xmath7750% of the mean flux , but no detailed correlation is present .",
    "this is not a suprise since for the optical data one expects sizeable contributions from the galaxy light and perhaps thermal emission from the accretion disk in addition to optical synchrotron .",
    "furthermore , one expects longer variability timescales for the lower energy synchrotron radiation , since the lower energy electrons which produce this radiation cool more slowly .",
    "we studied the x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray flux correlation with the help of the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) of @xcite .",
    "the dcf gives the linear correlation coefficient for the two light curves as a function of a time lag between them .",
    "the dcf is the standard tool used in the case of sparsely sampled data and gives fewer spurious results than a traditional correlation function analysis that interpolates between light - curve data points .",
    "we determined the statistical significance of the correlation coefficients with the help of a set of simulated @xmath0-ray light curves , computing for each simulated light curve the dcf with the observed x - ray data @xcite .",
    "these light - curves are generated by a superposition of triangular shots , with all shots having the same amplitude and the same rise and fall time .",
    "figure [ dcf ] gives the dcf for the x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray data sets . for a time lag of zero days",
    ", we find a dcf value of @xmath99 .",
    "the simulated data sets show that the correlation is significant . for uncorrelated lightcurves consisting of triangular shots with the same structure function",
    ", we calculate that the chance probability to get a larger dcf value at a time lag of zero days is 3.12% .",
    "figure [ xgamma ] shows the x - ray / tev @xmath0-ray flux correlation for all overlapping observations .",
    "the measurements entering this figure are shown by the circled data points in figs .",
    "[ lc1 ] and [ lc2 ] .",
    "each of these overlapping observations are simultaneous to within 5 minutes .",
    "the correlation shows substantial scatter , with similar x - ray ( tev ) fluxes sometimes corresponding to tev ( x - ray ) fluxes that differ by more than a factor of 2 from each other .",
    "the scatter may be an inherent property of the emission mechanism .",
    "alternatively , it may be caused by a short time lag between the flares in the two bands , not resolved by the sparse sampling during the campaign .",
    "figure [ xxcorr ] shows the correlation between the 10 kev fluxes and the 4 - 15 kev photon indices .",
    "a correlation can clearly be recognized in the sense that higher fluxes are accompanied by harder energy spectra . a similar correlation ( harder energy spectra for higher fluxes )",
    "have been reported for other bl lac - type objects , e.g. mrk 501 @xcite , 1es 1959 + 650 @xcite , h  1426 + 428 @xcite , and pks 2155 - 304 @xcite .",
    "we further scrutinized the temporal evolution of the photon indices with so called x - ray `` hysteresis '' curves @xcite , plotting the x - ray photon index as a function of x - ray flux , and indicating the temporal sequence of the measurement throughout the evolution of individual flares . in the simplest model whereby flares are formed by short lived shocks ( e.g. internal shocks from colliding blobs )",
    ", one expects the temporal evolution to be dictated by the interplay of the acceleration , cooling , and confinement times . for the fermi mechanism",
    ", the particle energies reached depend on the allowed acceleration time .",
    "thus , during the beginning of flares , the x - ray and @xmath0-ray energy spectra are expected to harden .",
    "once synchrotron cooling starts to dominate the particle energy spectra , the emitted photon energy spectra are expected to soften .",
    "we studied two x - ray flares , one occurring at the beginning of the campaign ( mjd 52612 to mjd 52615 ) , and the other at the end ( mjd 52651 to mjd 52653 ) . the first flare is shown in fig .",
    "this flare coincided with an increase of the tev @xmath0-ray flux by a factor of 2.4 from mjd 52612 to mjd 52613 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum hardens during the rising phase of the flare and softens during the decaying phase .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray spectrum is softer during the falling phase than during the rising phase .",
    "the `` clockwise '' evolution in the @xmath100 plane is consistent with the expectations from stochastic fermi acceleration and synchrotron cooling as described above .",
    "the data of the second flare are shown in fig .",
    "[ hyst2 ] .",
    "the tev @xmath0-ray flux increased from mjd 52650 to mjd 52651 by a factor of 3.8 and remained roughly constant during the following two nights of observations . while the x - ray flux increased from mjd 52652 to 52653 by a factor of @xmath101 , the tev flux measured at the same time as the x - ray fluxes did not increase substantially .",
    "the general trend is that the spectrum hardens as the flux increases , although at mjd 52652.25 , the spectrum softens temporarily while the flux is still increasing .",
    "unfortunately , our observations did not cover the decaying phase of the flare .",
    "[ [ section-13 ] ]    the multiwavelength campaign showed mrk 421 in a level of intermediate activity . during the observational campaign ,",
    "mrk 421 showed significant flux variability in the radio , optical , x - ray and @xmath0-ray bands and significant spectral variability at x - rays and tev @xmath0-rays . while we measured an average tev @xmath0-ray photon index of @xmath76 2.8 ,",
    "the observations revealed evidence for spectral variability on a time scale of days .",
    "in particular , the data suggest very soft energy spectra with @xmath102 during the first half of the observation campaign .",
    "one of the most interesting results from this campaign is that the x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray fluxes are correlated on the @xmath10397% confidence level , but that we find widely different tev @xmath0-ray fluxes for a single x - ray flux and vice versa .",
    "the most extreme example is the `` orphan x - ray flare '' , seen on january 13 , 2003 ( mjd 52653 ) . the loose x - ray / tev correlation may suggest that the model parameters ( e.g. the volume of the emission zone ) change with time , or that the commonly made assumption of a single synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission zone is an over - simplification . our previous observations of mrk 421 had already shown a rather loose x - ray / tev @xmath0-ray correlation @xcite and the same applied for 1es 1959 + 650 @xcite . in the case of mrk 501",
    ", a rather tight correlation has been reported @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the correlation between the x - ray flux and photon index during a flare indicated a `` clockwise '' hysteresis . for mrk 421",
    ", @xcite also reported clockwise evolution .",
    "however , @xcite reported evidence for both , clockwise evolution during some flares and anti - clockwise evolution during other flares .",
    "if the ssc model indeed applies , these results may imply that the characteristic times scales of the most important processes ( acceleration time , radiative cooling time , escape time ) change from flare to flare and thus yield the different observed hysteresis behaviours .",
    "recently , @xcite emphasized that the geometry of the emitting region and its orientation relative to the line of sight influences the observed flux and spectral evolution and might thus further complicate the interpretation of the results . the x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray emission from mrk 421 data",
    "have been modeled with synchrotron self - compton codes by many groups , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a crucial model parameter is the jet doppler factor @xmath7 .",
    "the published models with doppler factors @xmath7 of 20 or lower generally predict tev energy spectra that are softer than the observed ones , especially if a correction for extragalactic absorption would be applied which steepens the energy spectra considerably .",
    "models with doppler factors @xmath7 on the order of 50 give satisfactory model fits to both the x - ray ( synchrotron ) and the tev ( inverse compton ) emission ( see the self - consistent modeling of @xcite and the discussions by @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite observed the mrk 421 parsec - scale radio jet with the very large baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "remarkably , they find apparent pattern speeds of only @xmath104 . as discussed by the authors , the highly relativistic motion inferred from tev observations",
    "can be reconciled with the modestly relativistic flow calculated from vlba observations by postulating that the jet slows down between the sub - parsec ( tev ) and parsec ( vlba ) regimes .",
    "it may be possible to describe the multi - wavelength data with a synchrotron - compton model and lower doppler factors by invoking additional seed photons .",
    "two new model variants that combine ingredients of ssc and external compton models have been proposed by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "while the first authors assume that downstream emission regions provide seed photons , the second authors speculate that the jet is composed of a fast spine with a slow - moving envelope . in this model ,",
    "the fast spine emits the x - ray and @xmath0-ray radiation .",
    "modeling of the data with these two inhomogeneous models is outside the scope of this paper .    in this discussion",
    "we do not want to embark on comprehensive modeling of the data from the entire campaign .",
    "our main aim is to draw the attention of the reader to a single remarkable fact : while it is difficult to model the data with doppler factors on the order of 20 and lower , much higher doppler factors can not be excluded right away . fig .",
    "[ nufnu ] shows two synchrotron self - compton models based on the simple snapshot code of @xcite .",
    "the code assumes a single spherical emission volume of radius @xmath105 relativistically approaching the observer with a jet doppler factor @xmath7 .",
    "the emission volume is homogeneously filled with a tangled magnetic field of strength @xmath30 and a non - thermal electron population .",
    "the electron energy spectrum follows @xmath106 @xmath107 with @xmath108 2 for electron lorentz factor @xmath0 between @xmath109 and @xmath110 and @xmath111 for lorentz factors between @xmath110 and @xmath112 . the code models extragalactic absorption owing to the @xmath113 pair - production processes of tev photons on photons from the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) using the cib model of @xcite .",
    "we discuss two models .",
    "we show the first model for illustrative purposes only .",
    "it uses the `` conventional '' model parameters ( @xmath114 ) derived from the time - dependent self - consistent analysis of a different but similar data set @xcite .",
    "the second model uses a very high doppler factor ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "all the model parameters are given in table [ fits ] .",
    "for both models , we assured that the model parameters were chosen self - consistently .",
    "causality arguments require that the radius @xmath105 satisfies @xmath116  cm for @xmath117 and @xmath118  cm for @xmath119 for a flux variability time scale of @xmath120 30  min .",
    "note that the flux variability time scale sets a lower limit on @xmath105 but no upper limit , if the flux variability time scale is not dominated by light travel time effects but by other effects ( e.g.  by the stability of a strong shock front ) .",
    "we checked that the sed ( i ) fits the x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray data , and ( ii ) is consistent with the expected spectral shape owing to radiative cooling . in the first model ,",
    "the latter self - consistency is assured by our previous self - consistent time - dependent modeling . in the second model ,",
    "we construct an electron spectrum based on the general results for electrons suffering synchrotron and inverse compton losses @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the electron energy spectrum breaks at @xmath121 @xmath122 . the laboratory - frame synchrotron cooling time for electrons at the break is @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath110 @xmath129^{-1}~$ ] @xmath130 ( @xmath131 is the thomson cross section and @xmath132 is the electron mass ) .",
    "an electron spectrum as the one used here could result from the radiative cooling of a @xmath133 electron energy spectrum that extends from @xmath109 to @xmath112 , resulting in a spectrum with @xmath133 and @xmath111 below and above @xmath110 , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "[ nufnu ] , both models fail to predict the observed radio fluxes as a consequence of synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "we would like to emphasize that we do not regard the discrepancy as a shortcoming of the model .",
    "electrons producing the radio emission cool on much longer time scales , and the radio emission will be dominated by an accumulation of downstream plasma which stopped contributing to the x - ray and tev emission long time ago .",
    "we could model the radio emission with another emission component ( see e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "however , doing so is arbitrary : for a small number of data points we would add an additional model component with many free model parameters .    in table",
    "[ fits ] we list for both models the magnetic field energy density @xmath134 , the energy density in electrons @xmath135 , the ratio @xmath136 , and the kinetic luminosity @xmath137 for @xmath76 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the model with a low doppler factor is closer to equipartition between magnetic field and particles .",
    "the kinetic luminosity is similar for the two models , with a high radiative efficiency of the low-@xmath7 model making up for the stronger boosting of the high-@xmath7 model .",
    "if taken seriously , the model with @xmath138 1000 would imply that the x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray emission is produced by an ultra - relativistic particle dominated wind , very close to the supermassive black hole .",
    "the fact that seven blazars have been detected at tev energies seems to argue against extremely relativistic outflows with bulk lorentz factors @xmath4 on the order of 1000 , as isotropic emission would be beamed into an opening angle of @xmath139 and would make the observation of the emission unlikely .",
    "however , the argument only applies if the jet opening angle is equal or smaller than @xmath139 . having a larger jet opening angle would require a higher total jet - luminosity as some jet segments would not contribute to the observed emission .",
    "however , the jet - luminosities listed in the table are several orders of magnitude below the eddington luminosity of a @xmath140 solar mass black hole that is suspected to be at the core of mrk 421 @xcite .",

    "<S> were initiated by the detection of x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray flares with the all sky monitor ( asm ) on board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) and the 10  m whipple @xmath0-ray telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the campaign included observational coverage in the radio ( university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ) , optical ( boltwood , la palma kva 0.6 m , wiyn 0.9 m ) , x - ray ( rxte pointed telescopes ) , and tev @xmath0-ray ( whipple and hegra ) bands .    at tev energies , the observations revealed several flares at intermediate flux levels , peaking between 1 and 1.5 times the flux from the crab nebula . while the time averaged spectrum can be fitted with a single power law of photon index @xmath1 from @xmath2 , we find some evidence for spectral variability . confirming earlier results , the campaign reveals a rather loose correlation between the x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray fluxes . in one case , </S>",
    "<S> a very strong x - ray flare is not accompanied by a comparable tev @xmath0-ray flare . </S>",
    "<S> although the source flux was variable in the optical and radio bands , the sparse sampling of the optical and radio light curves does not allow us to study the correlation properties in detail .    </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple analysis of the data with a synchrotron - self compton model , emphasizing that models with very high doppler factors and low magnetic fields can describe the data . </S>"
