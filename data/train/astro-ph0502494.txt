    "high redshift gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) may become useful beacons for the study of the young universe .",
    "gamma - ray bursts are expected to be visible out to very large redshifts ( z=10 - 20 , lamb & reichart 2000 ) , if indeed they are generated there , and offer the possibility to probe the interstellar medium along the line of sight and to address important cosmological issues like the evolution of the star formation rate .    before one can undertake such studies , however , it is important to understand the intrinsic properties of gamma - ray bursts at high redshift .",
    "there are only four grbs with a measured redshift larger than z=3 : grb 971214 at z=3.42 @xcite , which was localized by bepposax ; grb 000131 at z=4.5 @xcite , which was localized with the ipn ; and grb 020124 at z=3.20 @xcite and grb 030323 at z=3.37 @xcite , which were localized by hete-2 .",

    ", we present their spectral and temporal properties in section [ prompt ] and compare them with those of the bulk of the grb population .",
    "their energetics are discussed in section [ energetics ] , where it is noted that grb 030323 is the first grb detected at large redshift which does not belong to the bright end of the grb luminosity distribution . in this section",
    "we also show that hete-2 could have detected and localized grb 020124 at a redshift of z=6.4 at least , and we discuss some necessary conditions for the detection of soft , faint grbs at high redshift .",

    "the peak energy , e@xmath14 , is relatively well constrained to be about 90 kev .",
    "the difference between this value and the value of 133 kev quoted in barraud et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is due to the inclusion of the wxm data covering the range 2 - 25 kev in this refined analysis .      with a fluence of @xmath15 erg @xmath11 in the energy range 2 - 400 kev , grb 030323  belongs to the faintest 20% of hete grbs .",
    "its softness is 0.38 , making it an x - ray rich grb .",
    "the e@xmath14 value of @xmath16 kev is not well constrained and could be as low as 20 kev or as high as 200 kev .",
    "knowing the redshifts of grb 020124  and grb 030323  allows us to compute their _ intrinsic _ spectral parameters : e@xmath17 , the peak energy of the @xmath18f@xmath18 spectrum ; e@xmath1 , the isotropic - equivalent radiated energy ( in the energy range 1 - 10000 kev ) , and n@xmath19 the isotropic - equivalent photon number in the same energy range . in the following we adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and h@xmath22 . for grb 020124 , we get e@xmath0  = @xmath23 kev , e@xmath24 erg , and n@xmath25 photons . for grb 030323 , we get e@xmath0  = @xmath26 kev , e@xmath27 erg , and n@xmath28 photons .",
    "we note that grb 020124 is intrinsically bright , similar to grb 971214 , which had e@xmath1= @xmath29 erg @xcite ; and grb 000131 which had e@xmath1= @xmath30 erg @xcite .",
    "the isotropic - equivalent energy of grb 030323 is however about an order of magnitude fainter , a fact that demonstrates the ability of hete to detect and localize high - redshift grbs that are not at the bright end of the grb luminosity function .",

    "the e@xmath0  of grb 030323  is not well determined and we can not draw any conclusion based on this burst ( although for the sake of completeness we should mention that the best fit values give e@xmath31 / e@xmath0= 0.65 ) .",
    "the spectral parameters of grb 020124  are well determined , and the fact that this burst follows the e@xmath1- e@xmath0  relation closely could indicate that this relation has little or no evolution with the redshift .",
    "[ softness ] shows the position of grb 020124  and grb 030323   ( the two large triangles , grb 020124  is the rightmost large triangle ) in a fluence - softness diagram , among the population of grbs detected with hete ( barraud et al .",
    "this figure also shows the positions that these bursts would have in the same diagram if they had occured at redshifts 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , and 20 .",
    "the tracks of grb 020124  and grb 030323  in the figure are computed by taking into account the spectral redshift of the bursts , and assuming that we can measure the total fluence , even when the burst is at a high redshift . from this figure",
    "we can see that , at redshift 1 , grb 020124  would have been one of the brightest grbs detected by hete , while grb 030323  would have been in the middle of the fluence distribution .",
    "regarding their hardness , we note that at a redshift of unity , grb 020124and grb 030323  would both have been unambiguously classified as grbs , rather than xrr - grbs or xrfs .",
    "figure [ softness ] can also be used to discuss the maximum redshift at which hete could have detected grb 020124  and grb 030323 .",
    "based on this figure , we see that grb 030323  is very close to the boundary of the grb population detected and localized with hete . in contrast , the fluence of grb 020124  appears to remain well within the distribution of localized grbs up to redshift z @xmath32 15 . in reality , the fluence is not the best intensity indicator for grb _ detection _ because the trigger algorithm is essentially based on the search for excess counts in short time intervals . in order to assess more precisely the maximum redshift",
    "at which hete could have detected grb 020124 , we have performed a detailed analysis including the following steps :    - compute the trigger threshold ( number of counts ) of fregate at the time of grb 020124 , on the 1.3 sec and on the 5.2 sec trigger timescales .    - estimate the signal to noise ratio of grb 020124  for its detection by fregate .",
    "- determine the redshift at which the counts from grb 020124  would reach the trigger threshold of fregate , taking into account the effects of the distance , of the time dilation and of the spectral redshift of the photons .",
    "this analysis shows that a burst 3.2 times fainter than grb 020124  would have triggered fregate in the 7 - 30 kev energy range in a time window of 5.2 sec .",
    "we thus conclude that grb 020124  could have been detected by fregate up to a redshift z=6.4 .",
    "the trigger scheme of hete includes many more trigger possibilities than the simple trigger palette of fregate , especially some using longer timescales for triggering .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that grb 020124  could have been detected by hete up to redshift 7 - 8 . at this redshift hete",
    "could have localized grb 020124 because its localization capabilities are more dependent on the fluence of the burst than on its peak flux , and because the fluence decreases more slowly than the peak flux with the redshift .",
    "this is confirmed by figure [ softness ] which shows that , at a redshift z=8 , the fluence and the softness of grb 020124 would have been comparable with the fluences and softness of many grbs localized by hete .",
    "we finally note that , at redshifts higher than 10 , the fluence of grb 020124  remains comparable with the fluence of many grbs detected and localized with hete while its peak flux is well below the detection threshold .",
    "a consequence of this fact is that a mission can greatly improve its ability to detect high - z grbs if it is able to localize long , faint , soft transients .",
    "this is not the case for bepposax and hete-2 whose detection strategy is mainly based on the search for count excesses on relatively short timescales . a strategy based on the search for long , soft transients appearing in the _ image _ of the sky ,",
    "as is the case for swift - bat , appears more promising for detecting high - z grbs .",
    "the discussion in this section is mainly based on the information that has been published in papers on the afterglows and hosts of the four grbs with a measured redshift greater than 3 : grb 971214 @xcite , grb 000131 @xcite , grb 020124 @xcite , and grb 030323 @xcite .",
    "thanks to fast localizations by hete , the afterglows of grbs 020124 and 030323 were observed soon after the burst , while they were still bright .",

    "( 2002 ) in data taken 13.5 hours after the burst , but the first observation took place only two hours after the trigger and caught the afterglow at a magnitude r=18.5 @xcite .",
    "the identification of the afterglow of grb 030323 is due to gilmore et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in data taken 9.5 hours after the burst .",
    "the afterglow was first observed with rotse iii , when it had a magnitude r=18.4 , 6 hours after the burst .",
    "this contrasts with the afterglows of grb 971214 , and grb 000131 , which were identified when they had magnitudes r=22.1 , and r=23.3 , respectively .",
    "these quick detections allowed for spectroscopy of the afterglows while they were still moderately bright ( r=24 for grb 020124  and r=21.5 for grb 030323 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of grb 020124  and grb 030323  resulted in high quality spectra and in the detection of strong absorption line systems ( als ) in the afterglows of both grbs @xcite .",
    "the light curves of grb afterglows often display jet breaks , attributed to the confinement of the relativistic outflow into a small cone .",
    "rhoads ( 1997 ) has shown that jet breaks can be used to estimate @xmath34 , the jet opening angle , and e@xmath19 , the total energy output in @xmath35-rays .",
    "e@xmath19 is given by the following formula    @xmath36    where @xmath34 is the opening angle of the jet in radians .",
    "the afterglows of grb 020124  and grb 030323  were observed on several occasions during the few days following the bursts , but not frequently enough to unambiguously identify a possible jet break .",
    "berger et al . ( 2002 ) nevertheless argue that grb 020124  might have a jet break 10 - 20 days after the burst .",
    "the observations of grb 030323 , on the other hand , give an afterglow slope s=@xmath37 @xcite , showing that they took place before a possible jet break ( one expects s @xmath38 after the break ) . fig.1 .",

    "following equation ( 1 ) of frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and assuming a circumburst density of [ 0.1 @xmath41 , we find that the expected break time is 2.6 days for grb 020124 , and 5.7 days for grb 030323 . with the freedom allowed by the poor sampling of the light curves , and by the small ( but real ) scatter in the size of the energy reservoir , we consider that these numbers do not contradict the finding of frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and bloom , frail , and kulkarni ( 2003 ) that there is a standard radiated energy for grbs .",

    "the early localization of these two grbs , and the quick identification of their afterglows , made possible the identification of the host galaxy of grb 030323 , and placed stringent limits on the magnitude of the host galaxy of grb 020124 .",

    "we have used the chain of events which successfully led to the measurement of the redshifts of grb 020124  and grb 030323  as a baseline to discuss the conditions required for the identification of high - z grbs .",

    "we see a posteriori that this was the only way to measure their redshifts , given the faintness of their host galaxies . in these cases ,",
    "contrary to the case of grb 971214 , we could not rely on the spectroscopy of the host galaxy to measure the redshifts , and this might well be the case for the majority of high - z grbs .",

    "<S> we also discuss the energetics of grb 020124  and grb 030323  and show that they are compatible with the e@xmath0- e@xmath1  relation discovered by amati et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compute the maximum redshifts at which these bursts could have been detected by hete-2 and we address various issues connected with the detection and localization of high - z grbs . </S>"
