    "supersymmetry is preserved in this theory and is expected to have a considerable influence on the phase diagram .",
    "confinement and fermion condensation are the two relevant phenomena of qcd - like theories regardless of whether the fermions are in the fundamental or adjoint representation . at low temperatures",
    "the theory is in a confined phase with colourless strongly bound particles and unbroken centre symmetry .",
    "chiral symmetry is broken by a non - vanishing fermion condensate . at high temperatures",
    "there is a phase transition to a deconfined phase with spontaneously broken centre symmetry .",
    "the chiral condensate melts away leading to a restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "however , the deconfinement transition is only a mild crossover in qcd and other theories with fermions in the fundamental representation , due to the explicit breaking of centre symmetry by the quark action .",
    "by contrast , the transition from the confined to the deconfined phase is a true phase transition in adjqcd models for any value of the fermion mass and in the massless limit chiral symmetry restoration defines a second one that can have a different critical temperature .",
    "the picture changes completely when the boundary conditions of fermions are changed from thermal , i.e.  antiperiodic , to periodic .",
    "the path integral of the compactified theory on @xmath1  with periodic fermion boundary conditions ( @xmath2 ) corresponds to a twisted partition function instead of the usual thermal partition function @xmath3 $ ] . for sym",

    "if the same periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are applied in a compactified theory for adjoint quark and gauge fields , then an interesting interplay exists between bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom which avoids , in case of sym , an explicit supersymmetry breaking in contrast to the thermal case .",
    "the fermionic contributions can cancel the confining potential of the gauge bosons leading to a restoration of centre symmetry .",
    "in sym there is a cancellation to all orders in the perturbative expansion and a centre stabilisation by non - perturbative semi - classical contributions @xcite .",

    "there are different theoretical concepts related to @xmath2 .",

    "this gauge - higgs unification plays an important role in extensions of the standard model with an extra dimension .",
    "a further motivation for the investigations of @xmath2  is the large @xmath8 volume independence of gauge theories , known as eguchi - kawai reduction @xcite .",
    "this reduction implies an equivalence between the full four - dimensional gauge theory and a simple single site matrix model in the large @xmath8 limit . however , volume independence is known to fail for pure yang - mills due to the spontaneous breaking of centre symmetry driven by the compactification @xcite .",
    "adding adjoint fermions to the model ( adjoint eguchi - kawai models ) can in principle resolve the centre symmetry breaking keeping the large @xmath8 volume independence intact @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the ground state on the parameters of the theory can be determined from the effective potential .",
    "a perturbative loop expansions of the effective potential is characterised by powers of the coupling constant @xmath9 and a complete semi - classical expansion adds non - perturbative contributions , that typically come with exponentials of the coupling like @xmath10 .",
    "the one - loop approximation of the effective potential for pure yang - mills theory ( ym ) predicts the deconfined phase with spontaneously broken centre symmetry at high temperatures , and in qcd , with fermions in the fundamental representation , the explicit breaking of centre symmetry is reproduced at one - loop order .",
    "the applicability of semi - classical methods in qcd at lower temperatures and towards the deconfinement transition is limited . with intact supersymmetry",
    "there is an exact cancellation between fermionic and bosonic perturbative contributions in the loop expansion of the effective potential .",
    "the non - perturbative semi - classical effects are the dominant part of the effective potential @xcite .",

    "<S> fermion boundary conditions play a relevant role in revealing the confinement mechanism of @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory with one compactified space - time dimension . </S>",
    "<S> a deconfinement phase transition occurs for a sufficiently small compactification radius , equivalent to a high temperature in the thermal theory where antiperiodic fermion boundary conditions are applied . </S>",
    "<S> periodic fermion boundary conditions , on the other hand , are related to the witten index and confinement is expected to persist independently of the length of the compactified dimension . </S>",
    "<S> we study this aspect with lattice monte carlo simulations for different values of the fermion mass parameter that breaks supersymmetry softly . </S>",
    "<S> we find a deconfined region that shrinks when the fermion mass is lowered . </S>",
    "<S> deconfinement takes place between two confined regions at large and small compactification radii , that would correspond to low and high temperatures in the thermal theory . at the smallest fermion masses </S>",
    "<S> we find no indication of a deconfinement transition . </S>",
    "<S> these results are a first signal for the predicted continuity in the compactification of supersymmetric yang - mills theory . </S>"
