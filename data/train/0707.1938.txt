    "earlier for fcc - bcc martensitic transformation the model of heterogeneous nucleation ( in elastic fields of dislocations ) and wave growth of the martensite was formulated .",
    "the elastic field of dislocations disturbings the original lattice symmetry by selecting regions being most favorable for martensitic nucleation .",
    "such a region features the shape of a perpendicular parallelepiped , its edges being oriented along the eigenvectors @xmath0 of the strain tensor @xmath1 , its eigenvalues @xmath2 satisfying the conditions : @xmath3    the transformation starts with the emergence of an excited state with the shape of a parallelepiped , its pairs of faces are oscillating in opposed phase , thereby exciting controlling displacement waves orientate in the wave - normal @xmath4 close to @xmath5 . in the most simple approximation : @xmath6    according to the wave model @xcite of the martensite crystal growth ( fig.[fig1 ] ) in the interphase region",
    "there is the threshold flat strain of the tension ( @xmath7)-compression ( @xmath8 ) type . on the mesoscale within the crystal thickness",
    "this threshold strain is uniform .",
    "this model gives natural interpretation of the supersonic velocity * v * of a separate crystal growth .",
    "let s note that the given variant sets an upper limit of growth speed of a crystal for quite definite dynamic structure of the interphase region . for other types of martensitic transformations ( at other dynamic structure of the wave front ) growth speed can be less .",
    "the exceeding of threshold strain should lead to the loss of stability of an initial phase .",
    "components of finite strain disturbing the symmetry of an initial lattice can achieve values @xmath9 that are typical for the bein s strain .",
    "as shown earlier in the interphase region strongly non - equilibrium conditions are realized .",
    "controlling wave process ( cwp ) sets the lamellar form of crystals and the normal vector @xmath10 to a habit plane of a growing crystal : @xmath11    it is important that connection between absolute values of deformations and speeds @xmath12 and @xmath13 of elastic waves takes place @xmath14    at the threshold deformation @xmath15 therefore in it is possible to believe @xmath16",
    "in the case of the bcc - hcp transformation the preference are natural for giving cwp stimulating the fastest transformation of @xmath17 - planes of a cubic lattice to basic @xmath18 - planes of hcp lattice @xcite .",
    "it is achieved if the wave process carries the deformation of compression along a direction @xmath19 ( and the deformation of tension along a direction @xmath20 ) : @xmath21    after the loss of stability of the bcc - lattice the uniform ( on the scale of the crystal thickness ) deformation changes a nuclear potential relief , inducing the instability to the shear of either of the second plane .",
    "this shear finishes the formation of the hcp - lattice . in our opinion , there is one more key idea .",
    "namely : the lamellar area of a lattice ( which have lost the stability ) , aspiring in the constrained conditions to new symmetry of an arrangement of atoms , keeps the constant ratio of the main deformations given by the cwp .",
    "how it follows from , this ratio is equal @xmath22 .",
    "then , having the directions @xmath0 calculated preliminary , it is easy to express through the same parameter @xmath23 all morphological attributes ( the habit plane , the macroshear , the interphase orientational relationship , the relative change of volume and even the parameter of a hcp - lattice ) .",
    "the detailed analysis of the bcc - hcp transformation on an example of the titanium confirms this conclusion .",
    "alongside with and the condition of transformation of a plane @xmath24 in a plane @xmath25 is essential also : @xmath26    the values ( in gpa ) of elastic modules for bcc - ti were used at quantitative estimations : @xmath27 . for @xmath28_{b}$ ] and @xmath29_{b}$ ] from it is obtained : @xmath30    in particular from for bcc - ti it is obtained that @xmath31 .",
    "as is known there exists the interphase orientational relationship ( or ) . usually or indicate parallelism ( or approximate parallelism ) among the densely packed phase - planes and among angles of rotation in relation to the orientation of the densely packed directions possessed by the parallel planes . in particular for the bcc- hcp martensitic transformation",
    "it is natural to believe that the plane which has tested the fastest transformation is included in or : @xmath32    it is necessary to find only the conformity between the densely packed directions laying in planes . for this purpose",
    "it is enough to calculate the angle of the turn of the orthogonal axes @xmath33 , @xmath34 to the orthogonal axes @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "it is necessary to take into account , that the turning material actually appears in the flat `` channel '' formed by the cwp in the bulk of the metastable austenite .",
    "then the formation of a new phase with inevitability results in the turn of a lattice . the blacked out area on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] corresponds to the metastable austenite .",

    "axes of the main deformations correspond to vertical and horizontal directions .",
    "the rectangular with arrows corresponds to ( at some moment of time @xmath38 ) the position of section of the rectangular parallelepiped forming ( during propagating ) the area ( light area on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) playing a role of the flat `` channel '' inside of the austenite . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it is obvious , that the section of `` channel '' is consistently `` swept up '' by the diagonal ( along the vector d ) of the rectangular concerning both walls of `` channel '' .    on fig .",

    "the vectors @xmath43 correspond to displacements of boundary points of a diagonal .",
    "they are shown as the sums of final displacements along the main axes of deformation .",
