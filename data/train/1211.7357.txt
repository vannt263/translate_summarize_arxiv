    "in the past few years the field of ultracold quantum gases has provided one of the best scenarios for exploration of one of the most intriguing quantum phenomena present in a system of just a few particles , namely , the efimov effect @xcite .",
    "in addition to providing the first experimental observation of this effect @xcite-@xcite , experiments have now shown that one of its most fundamental assumptions must be reconsidered . in his original work ,",
    "efimov derived the form of the three - body effective interaction that needed to be  regularized \" at short distances to prevent the divergence of the ground - state energy ( known as the thomas collapse @xcite ) .",
    "this regularization , according to some simple and reasonable arguments , should be arbitrary , implying that the energy of the efimov states , as well as any other scattering observable , should depend on a single , system dependent , three - body parameter ( 3bp ) incorporating all the details of the interactions at short distances .",
    "this assumption , however , has been proven to be untrue for ultracold atoms .",
    "ultracold quantum gas experiments @xcite-@xcite have shown that the value of the @xmath0-wave scattering length at which the first efimov state appears , which we denote by the value @xmath4 , is between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where under the previous assumption one would expect its value to be randomly located at values larger than @xmath7 .",
    "[ here , @xmath8 is the van der waals length , characterizing the range of the typical @xmath9 interaction between two neutral particles of mass @xmath10 . ]",
    "this astounding experimental observation has sparked a great deal of theoretical interests , and the physical mechanisms behind this observation is still under debate .",
    "although very interesting theoretical models have been explored @xcite-@xcite , we will focus here on the one we recently developed @xcite using the adiabatic hyperspherical representation .",
    "specifically , in this paper we elaborate our physical picture through which the universality of the 3bp can be understood , and we also demonstrate the strong three - body multichannel nature of the problem .",
    "our analysis of the universality of the three - body parameter is based on the adiabatic hyperspherical representation .",
    "the following is a sketch of its basic aspects and fundamental equations .",
    "a more detailed description can be found , for instance , in refs .",
    "we start here from the hyperradial schrdinger equation : @xmath11f_{\\nu}(r )    + \\sum_{\\nu'\\neq\\nu } w_{\\nu\\nu'}(r ) f_{\\nu'}(r)=e    f_\\nu(r).\\label{sradeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the hyperradius @xmath12 can be expressed in terms of the interparticle distances for a system of three equal masses @xmath10 , @xmath13 , and it is a coordinate that describes the overall size of the system ; @xmath14 is a collective index that represents all quantum numbers necessary to label each channel ; @xmath15 is the three - body reduced mass for three identical bosons ; @xmath16 is the total energy ; and @xmath17 is the hyperradial wave function . the simple picture resulting from this representation originates from the fact that nonadiabatic couplings @xmath18 are the quantities that drive inelastic transitions , and from the fact that the effective hyperradial potentials @xmath19 , like any usual potential , support bound and resonant states , but now for the three ( or more ) particle system .    for our present study of three identical bosons in the total angular momentum state @xmath20 ( @xmath21 being the parity )",
    ", the lennard - jones potential is adopted to model the interatomic interactions : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a parameter adjusted to give the desired @xmath24 and number of bound states . for convenience , we denote the values of @xmath23 at which there exist zero - energy bound states ( @xmath25 ) as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 corresponds to the number of @xmath0-wave bound states . as the number of bound states increases , however , the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ sradeq ] ) become more complicated and a specialized technique @xcite has been developed to treat such cases .",
    "reference  @xcite solves the three - body problem using a single channel model for the interatomic interaction and shows that , when it is described by a lennard - jones potential ( which has the proper @xmath9 asymptotic behavior ) , three - body observables are largely independent of the details of the interactions , i.e. , of the number of two - body bound states as well as other truly short - range three - body forces . in our physical picture , it is the sharp cliff due to the @xmath9 two - body interaction that leads to the universality of the 3bp . in this case ,",
    "when particles approaches distances @xmath28 the drastic increase of the _ local _ classical velocity @xmath29 suppress the probability for two particles to exist between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which is proportional to @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the suppression of the probability to find two particles at short distances can be seen in the wkb approximation to the two - body wave function : @xmath33,\\label{psiwkb}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is a normalization constant and @xmath35 $ ] . therefore , the suppression of the wave function inside the potential well is simply related to factor @xmath36 which leads to amplitude suppression of the wkb wave function [ eq .  ( [ psiwkb ] ) ] between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( a)illustrates this effect by comparing the fully numerical two - body wavefunction and the @xmath36 term from the wkb solution above . ] such suppression on the two - body level is directly reflected in the three - body system as the suppression of the probability to find all three particles at short distances , thus eliminating ( almost fully ) the necessity for accounting for the details of the interactions there .",
    "this suppression is manifested through the presence of a universal repulsive three - body barrier , resulting from the increase of the kinetic energy at short distances , for when particles approach distances smaller than @xmath37 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( b ) ] .",
    "our results correctly reproduce the experimentally observed universality @xcite-@xcite within 15% , and we o expect them to be valid for broad feshbach resonances . for narrow feshbach resonances , however , other factors @xcite could lead to deviations from such predictions , but this issue is only in the early stages of being investigated and quantified thus far .    . here",
    ", the solid - black curve is the potential @xmath38 with @xmath39 , the red - dashed curve is the numerical solution for @xmath40 and the black - dot - dashed curve is the suppression factor @xmath41 .",
    "( b ) corresponding three - body effective potential for the model in ( a ) with @xmath42 .",
    "this potential ( red - solid curve ) is the one relevant for efimov physics where @xmath43 and it clearly displays the repulsive barrier for @xmath44 which suppresses the probability of finding particles at shorter distances and leads to the approximate universality of the 3bp . ]    this physical picture is , in fact , closely related to the strong three - body multichannel nature of the problem .",
    "the increase of the local velocity @xmath45 , evidently , translates to the increase of the kinetic energy in the problem . at the three - body level , this implies large values for the nonadiabatic couplings @xmath46 , which in fact originate in the hyperradial kinetic energy .",
    "therefore , the approximation of neglecting @xmath46 in solving eq .",
    "( [ sradeq ] ) can lead to a poor description of the system .",
    "in fact , the strong multichannel nature of the problem can be illustrated by comparing the results obtained from a single channel approximation to eq .",
    "( [ sradeq ] ) , i.e. , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , with our solutions of the fully coupled system of equations .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ]  ( a ) shows the three - body parameter @xmath49 [ related to the energy of the lowest efimov state through the relation @xmath50 obtained for the @xmath51 model within the single channel approximation ( open triangles ) as well as our full numerical results ( open circles ) .",
    "the disagreement between these quantities increases with the number of @xmath0-wave bound states @xmath27 , meaning that the physics controlling the results becomes more and more multichannel in nature .",
    "nevertheless , we find that by imposing a simple change in the adiabatic potentials near the barrier  to make the barrier _ more _ repulsive [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( b ) ]  the single channel approximation for @xmath49 [ filled circles in fig .  [ fig2 ]  ( a ) ] reproduces the full numerical calculations much better .",
    "this agreement indicates that most of the nonadiabaticity of the problem is related to the exact shape of the barrier and that , to some extent , the effect of the nonadiabatic couplings is to make the effective potential @xmath19 more repulsive . for these reasons and , of course , the universality of our full calculations",
    ", we believe that , despite the strong multichannel nature , the short - range barrier in the three - body effective potentials indeed offers a physically valid explanation of the approximate universality of the three - body parameter for atomic systems whose long - range interactions are controlled by the van der waals potential .",
    "obtained from a single channel approximation ( open triangles ) as well as for our full numerical results ( open circles ) using the @xmath51 model .",
    "the single channel approximation can be improved by imposing a simple change in the adiabatic potentials near the barrier , as is shown in ( b ) . there",
    "we smoothly connect the three - body potential for @xmath51 ( red solid line ) to the barrier obtained for the model potential @xmath52 [ @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath9 otherwise ] ( black solid line ) , resulting in the potential labeled by @xmath55 ( green solid line ) .",
    "this new potential is actually more repulsive and has energies [ filled circles in ( a ) ] that are much closer to our full numerical calculations . ]    in summary , we have elaborated our physical picture for the universality of the 3bp in terms of the increase of the local classical velocity and demonstrated the strong multichannel nature of the problem .",
    "this fact emphasizes the necessity to fully describe the three - body problem for additional realistic systems . in this vein , we have also recently shown that the universal principles analyzed here also apply to heteronuclear systems @xcite and to systems with small scattering lengths @xcite .",
    "these results once more show that ultracold quantum gases offer a unique opportunity to study some of the most deep and fundamental aspects of few - body systems ."
