    "we then took 11 snapshots ( black dots in figure 1 ) at the saturated stage and used them to calculating the quantities in following sections .",

    "the magnetic field strength estimated with rm using equation ( 5 ) would be unbiased , only if the correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath61 is null or weak , as noted in , e.g. , @xcite . both observations @xcite and numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we have small values , @xmath67 , except for the case of @xmath68 and @xmath69 ; even in the case , we have @xmath70 .",
    "the weak correlation means that the rm field strength in equation ( 5 ) should correctly represent the true magnetic field strength , as further discussed in @xcite .",

    "for instance , we have @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and @xcite reported a negative correlation for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we note that the correlation coefficients would depend not only on @xmath54 and @xmath15 , but also on the nature of forcing .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , for instance , @xcite reported a study of supersonic turbulence with solenoidal and compressive drivings where the density pdf was analyzed in details .",
    "in general , compressible forcing results in stronger compression and so larger standard deviation of @xmath76 , @xmath77 , than the solenoidal forcing .",
    "it tells that the correlation coefficient is expected to be different in turbulences driven by solenoidal and compressible forcings , and the results presented in the next section could be affected by the nature of forcing . in this paper , we consider only the turbulence with solenoidal forcing , leaving the effects of the nature of forcing as a future study .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the frequency distribution of rms in turbulence simulation is well fitted to the gaussian for the case of @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath30 is shown to be anti - correlated with the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the frequency distribution of rm/@xmath29 , @xmath78 , as noted in introduction . from a physical point of view",
    ", the broadening of the width of rm distribution is caused by fluctuating gas and magnetic field .",
    "so it is easily expected that @xmath78 would also depend on @xmath15 . here , we further explore the possible relation among @xmath30 , @xmath78 , and @xmath15 based on the new simulations described in the previous section .    to obtain the relation among @xmath30 , @xmath78 , and @xmath15",
    ", we took five viewing angles , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the angle between the regular magnetic field , @xmath83 , and the los ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "we first calculated rm for the @xmath82 s in our nine simulations .",
    "table 2 show @xmath85 , normalized with rm due to @xmath30 , @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the number density of the background medium .",
    "@xmath88 is close to unity indicating that @xmath85 is caused mostly by @xmath30 , except for @xmath89 where the contribution of perturbed @xmath90 is more important .",
    "we then calculated the frequency distribution of rm/@xmath29 , @xmath91 , and @xmath78 .",
    "for the gaussian distribution , the fwhm is related to the standard deviation , @xmath92 , as @xmath93 .",
    "the resulting 45 fwhms are listed in table 3 .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath78 versus the los regular field strength , @xmath84 , for the 45 fwhms . here",
    ", the magnetic field strength is for the representative values , @xmath94 k and @xmath95 @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath78 is larger for larger @xmath54 and for larger @xmath82 , as already pointed in @xcite .",
    "so @xmath78 is anti - correlated with @xmath30 . for each @xmath15 , we fitted the relation between @xmath30 and @xmath78 with dashed lines .",
    "the broadening of the width of rm distribution is due to the fluctuating magnetic field and electron density .",
    "so as expected , @xmath78 is larger for larger @xmath15 .",
    "we got the relation among @xmath30 , @xmath78 , and @xmath15 by fitting the 45 fwhms in table 3 to a single formula , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are fitting parameters .",
    "the best fit we found , @xmath91 , was used to calculate @xmath78 in this paper , while the log of it , @xmath99 , was used in @xcite .",
    "it is because published observations mostly provide @xmath91 ( see the next section ) , and so it is easier to measure the fwhm of @xmath91 .",
    "we found that the fwhm of @xmath91 is @xmath100 times smaller than the fwhm of @xmath99 . with the fwhm of @xmath99",
    ", we would obtain the fitted relation that is consistent with that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 3 ) ) . ] is @xmath101 where the errors indicate the fitting uncertainty .",
    "again , @xmath30 is for @xmath94 k and @xmath95 @xmath25 , and scales as @xmath102 for other values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( see equation ( 10 ) ) .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath30 as a function of @xmath105 for fwhms in figure 2 along with the fitting , demonstrating the goodness of the fitting .",
    "the empirical relation in equation ( 12 ) would provide a handy way to quantify the los regular field strength in regions where the mach number and the rm distribution have been obtained .",
    "it is interesting to see that the relation is applied even to the case of fairly large viewing angle , @xmath89 .",
    "however , it is clear that the relation should break down if @xmath106 and so @xmath107 .",
    "so it can be applied only to regions with @xmath108 not too small .",
    "the above relation can be approximately reproduced from @xmath109 for alfvnic perturbations , where @xmath110 is the alfvn speed . in the case",
    "that the correlation between @xmath65 and @xmath66 is weak ( see section 2 ) , roughly @xmath111 , so @xmath112 .",
    "also , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . combining these",
    ", we have @xmath115 . of course",
    ", the perturbations in our simulations are not totally alfvnic and the correlation between @xmath65 and @xmath66 is not completely null .",
    "so we got the relation with the exponents which are somewhat different from unity .",
    "to derive @xmath30 using equation ( 12 ) , it requires us to know not only the rm distribution , but also the mach number",
    ". it would be handy if we have an independent way to determine the mach number . from numerical simulations for isothermal , hydrodynamic or mhd turbulence",
    ", it is known that the density pdf is approximately fitted to the log - normal distribution , and its standard deviation , @xmath117 , increases as the rms mach number of turbulent flows increases @xcite .",
