    "<S> we show that the transition between a eth phase and a many - body localized phase is marked by the different finite size scaling behaviour of the decay of the loschmidt echo and its temporal fluctuations in the infinite time limit , despite the fact that the finite time behaviour of such quantities is dramatically different approach the mbl phase , so that temporal fluctuations can not be inferred from the infinite time average of the loschmidt echo . </S>",

    "<S> introduction. _ many - body localization ( mbl ) is a phenomenon occurring in some interacting quantum many - body systems in presence of a critical value of strong disorder which drives the transition from a generic thermalizing phase . </S>",
    "<S> mbl has received in recent years an enormous attention @xcite due to its extremely rich and novel phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> mbl is characterized by a lack of thermalization and even equilibration , logarithmic growth of entanglement , logarithmic light cone for the spreading of correlations , area law for the entanglement in high - energy eigenstates , quasi - local conserved quantities of motion , without being integrable systems . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , integrable systems do equilibrate , typically to the generalized gibbs ensemble , whereas the slow dynamics induced by mbl hamiltonians keeps the system away from equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> in order to understand the behavior away from equilibrium of such systems , one has to study the temporal fluctuations of observables . </S>",
    "<S> equilibration is indeed ensued when such fluctuations vanish in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of fluctuations in any observable is ruled by the amount of revivals in the wave - function , that is measured by the loschmidt echo , namely the overlap of the initial wave - function with that at a later time . </S>",
    "<S> this overlap is part of a number of fidelity measures that have been capable of detecting and study in detail quantum phase transitions . in this paper , we show that the mbl transition , being mainly a dynamical phenomenon , is well understood by le and fidelity measures , and that the critical value for disorder can be detected by such measures .    in this paper , we study the disordered heisenberg spin-1/2 chain model describing interacting fermions . in the weak disorder regime , </S>",
    "<S> the system is non - integrable and it does thermalize through the mechanism of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth)@xcite , namely the fact that the highly excited states of the hamiltonian yield thermal expectation values for most local observables . increasing disorder will not make the system integrable , however , for a critical value of the disorder a transition happens to mbl . the eth hypothesis breaks down , and </S>",
    "<S> even the diagonal ensemble will not return thermal expectation values . </S>",
    "<S> this ensemble should in any case reproduce the behaviour of observables in the long time regime after ( non thermal ) equilibration has happened . however , if local observables have strong time fluctuations , this means that even locally the system is still away from equilibrium . in order to study this behaviour , we resort to fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> we define fidelity between two quantum states @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xmath2 which reduces to the overlap of wave functions in the case of pure quantum states @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> previous work @xcite has investigated the mbl transition using fidelity and loschimidt echo ( le ) . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity between two ground states shows that both anderson localization and mbl feature orthogonality catastrophe in the ground state . in @xcite , it is shown a power - law decay with time for the le after a sudden quench with a completely factorized state as initial state . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in locating the mbl transition point and describing the fate of temporal fluctuations over long times . </S>",

    "<S> this quantity is involved in equilibration because of the inverse participation ratio @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , given a wave function @xmath10 , the inverse participation ratio is defined by @xmath11@xcite . for @xmath12 </S>",

    "<S> however , here the infinite time limit is misleading . we need to consider finite times @xmath30 to average over , and finite sizes @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the scaling of the fluctuations with both @xmath31 results in a fast equilibration for the eth phase and a survival of time fluctuations for the mbl phase . </S>",

    "<S> the infinite time average of le becomes @xmath73 moreover , the infinite time average of temporal fluctuations reads @xmath74 we compute these quantities as a function of the disorder strentgh @xmath63 and see that they both show different behaviors in the eth phase and mbl phase . </S>",
    "<S> fig2:[fig : leavg ] shows the infinite temporal average of the loschmidt echo . in the eth phase the average le is small and independent of disorder strength </S>",
    "<S> however , at the transition is increases dramatically and then keeps growing with disorder strength in the mbl phase . in panel fig2:[varle ] , the temporal fluctuations show a similar behavior . a critical point at @xmath75 can be located to mark the phase transition . </S>",

    "<S> , we are interested in how the above quantities scale with system size deep in the eth and mbl phases . in fig:(3 ) we show @xmath80 and @xmath81 scaling with the system size @xmath29 . in fig:[fig : le0_5 ] , we see the finite size scaling in the eth phase(@xmath82 ) while fig:[fig : le6_5 ] shows the @xmath80 scaling with the system size in the mbl phase(@xmath83 ) .    </S>",

    "<S> the transition from a slightly growing exponent to a linear decay exponent is an important feature showing the mbl phase transition . in the thermal dynamic limit </S>",

    "<S> _ equilibration at finite times. _ from the observation above , we find the infinite time average of le decays exponentially with the system size @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> although it decays much slower in the mbl phase , the exponential decaying law proves that the infinite temporal fluctuation of a local observable is very small in the thermodynamic limit . however , infinite time can be misleading if the actual time for equilibration grows very fast with system size . in the following , </S>",

    "<S> the fact that equilibrium can not in practice be observed in the mbl phase needs to be taken in consideration .    _ scrambling power. _ here , we show that the two dynamical phases are also distinguished in therms of their scrambling powers . </S>",

    "<S> both methods give a critical point for the mbl transition around @xmath136 , which is compatible with other known estimates . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that , given the fact that the system is relaxing slowly in most of its local observables , the infinite time average of the loschmidt echo does not characterize the size of fluctuations in reasonable times . </S>",
