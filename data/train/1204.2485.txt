    "lvy flights are a special class of random walk whose step lengths follow a power - law tailed distribution  @xcite .",
    "they have been proved to be the most efficient type of space exploration that can be adopted by a random searcher looking for scarce resources in an unknown environment  @xcite . probably for this reason ,",
    "there are plenty of empirical evidences that movement patterns are compatible with lvy flights in many different contexts where efficiency matters  @xcite .",
    "in particular , lvy flights appear recurrently in the description of the motion of animals in real space ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "animals explore the environment mainly for searching food resources , and it is therefore plausible to ascribe the optimality of their search strategies to a selective evolutionary process .",
    "recently , radicchi _ et al .",
    "_ have provided empirical evidence that also human players participating in on - line auctions explore the bid space performing lvy flights  @xcite .",
    "the exploration of the bid space represents a search process , but purely mental because performed in an abstract space .",
    "interestingly , players adopt nearly optimal lvy flight exponents , in the sense that the values of the exponent used in real auctions are close to the one that maximizes their economic return . in  @xcite",
    ", the search process in the bid space is studied as a game theoretical model , where the optimal exponent value corresponds to a nash equilibrium  @xcite .    here , we propose an evolutionary model in which the reproductive fitness of the individuals is proportional to their ability to win the auctions , and we show that the values of the lvy flight exponents to which the model converges are very close to those measured in real data .",
    "this approach relaxes some of the assumptions made in the traditional game theoretical analysis , and deepens the understanding of the results : the optimality of the strategies adopted by bidders in on - line auctions can be seen as the outcome of a ( evolutionary ) learning process .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  ii , we provide a detailed description of the type of auctions studied and modeled in this paper .",
    "section  iii is devoted to the description of the model and its analytical treatment .",
    "in particular , section  iiia describes the case in which all players can choose only a bid value , while , in section  iiib , we generalize the model to the case in which players can place an arbitrary number of bids .",
    "section  iiic is dedicated to the evolutionary game theoretical implementation of the model .",
    "sections  iv and  v are respectively devoted to the description of the numerical simulations of the model and to the estimation of the computational complexity needed to simulate or solve the model . in section",
    "vi , we provide a detailed description of the results of the model . finally ,",
    "in section  vii , we draw our final comments and considerations .",
    "lowest unique bid ( lub ) auctions are a recent generation of online games where the winners of the auctions may purchase expensive goods for strikingly small prices : cars , boats and even houses can be bought for only tens or hundreds of dollars ( or euros , pounds , etc . ) .",
    "the mechanism of the game is very simple . at the beginning of the auction , a good ,",
    "whose typical market price is higher than a thousand dollars , is put up for auction .",
    "the game duration is _ a priori _ fixed and generally two or three weeks long .",
    "a bid can be any amount ( in cents ) from one cent to a certain maximum value @xmath0 , generally lower than one hundred dollars . for placing a bid ,",
    "a player has to pay a fee , whose entity ranges from one to ten dollars depending on the game . during the auction , players know only the status of their own bids meaning whether they are winning or not .",
    "none of the players knows where the others have placed their bids until the end of the game .",
    "multiple bids on the same value from the same player are allowed , but do not influence the outcome of the auction since a bid is considered as unique when a unique player has bid that value even if more than once .",
    "when the time dedicated to the auction expires , the winner is the player who made the lub and can finally purchase the good for the value of the winning bid .",
    "for example , if at the end of the auction bid value @xmath1 is occupied by two bids ( @xmath2 ) , while @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the number of bids placed on values @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , then the winner is the player who has bid on value @xmath11 because this is the lowest bid among all unique bid values . + a similar mechanism",
    "is also used in highest unique bid ( hub ) auctions . in this type of the games ,",
    "the rules are the same as those of lub auctions , with the only difference that the winning value is the unmatched bid closest to the maximal bid value admitted in the game ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) .",
    "+ lub and hub auctions represent competitive arenas where players perform searches for a single target whose position is determined by the bids of the whole population .",
    "it is important to stress that , during the game , players are not aware of the values on which the other players have placed their bids , and therefore the exploration of the bid space of each player can be considered independent . also , since the cost of each bid is much larger than the natural unit of the game ( one cent ) , the number of steps that can be performed by a single player is limited and allows only a partial exploration of the bid space .",
    "players need therefore good strategies in order to maximize their winning chances and simultaneously maintain limited their investments .     the absolute value of the difference between the two consecutive bid vales @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 indicates the rank position of each bid in a ranking in which bids have been sorted accordingly to their time stamp . in the inset",
    ", we plot the pdf @xmath15 of the bid change amounts @xmath16 ( red circles ) .",
    "the pdf is fitted with a power - law function and the best estimate of the decay exponent is @xmath17 ( black dashed line ) .",
    "this figure refers to the exploration of the bid space performed by a single player in a single auction .",
    "a complete analysis of the movement patterns of hundreds of players was performed in our previous work  @xcite .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in our previous work  @xcite , we have studied in detail the dynamical features of the bid space exploration performed by players in real lub and hub auctions .",
    "we have found that the exploration of the bid space is bursty : consecutive bid values are generally close to each other , but from time to time players perform longer jumps . in particular , the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath15 of the bid change amount @xmath16 ( @xmath16 is defined as the absolute value of the difference between two consecutive bid values ) is consistent with a power - law @xmath18 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : example ] ) .",
    "the exploration of the bid space is therefore consistent with a discrete version of a lvy flight  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , we have found that the pdf @xmath19 of the lvy flight exponents , adopted in real auctions , is peaked around the average value @xmath20 and with standard deviation equal to @xmath21 .",
    "+ the empirical observation of lvy flights provided in  @xcite is by far the most significant evidence of this phenomenology in natural search processes . differently from previous studies regarding biological  @xcite and mobility  @xcite systems where `` two orders of magnitude of scaling can represent a luxury ''  @xcite ,",
    "the power - law decay can be clearly observed even over four orders of magnitude .",
    "the reason is that the space is not strictly physical and movements of tens of thousands cents can be performed at the same price of those one cent long : players explore the bid space in a effectively _ super - diffusive _ fashion , and steps are made at a virtually _ infinite _ velocity .",
    "in this section , we provide an analytical model for lub auctions , but the model can be easily extended also to hub auctions . supported by empirical evidence , in our model we assume that players explore the bid space performing lvy flights . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we have provided a model based on stronger assumptions . in particular , we have studied the winning chances of a player participating in an auction against a population of players using exactly the same exponent value . here differently , we do not make any assumption regarding the choice of the exponents .",
    "we let the exponents to be random variates extracted from a generic pdf , and study an evolutionary theoretical version of the game . independently of the initial pdf",
    ", the pdf of the adopted exponents naturally evolves to a stable distribution centered around a value remarkably close to the one of the exponents measured in real auctions .",

    "<S> contrarily to previous modeling , our approach describes the emergence of the observed exponent without resorting to any strong assumptions on the initial searching strategies . </S>",
    "<S> our results generalize earlier research , and open novel questions in cognitive , behavioral and evolutionary sciences . </S>"
