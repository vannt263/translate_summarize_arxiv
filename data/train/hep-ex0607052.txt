    "understanding hadronization , or the process by which elementary partons ( gluons and quarks ) evolve into mesons and baryons , is complicated by its intrinsically non - perturbative nature . due to the fact that gluons carry two color indices whereas quarks carry only one ,",
    "the intrinsic gluon - gluon coupling strength ( @xmath12=3 ) is larger than the intrinsic quark - gluon coupling strength ( @xmath13=4/3 ) .",
    "radiation of secondary and tertiary gluons is therefore expected to be more likely when hadronization is initiated by a gluon rather than by a quark .",
    "this results in a greater number of final state hadrons as well as a larger average transverse momentum in the former case compared to the latter case . in the limit @xmath14 ,",
    "the ratio of the number of hadrons produced in gluon - initiated jets to the number of hadrons produced in quark - initiated jets is expected , in lowest order , to approach the well - known color - counting ratio @xmath15=9/4@xcite .",
    "many experiments have searched for , and found , multiplicity and jet shape differences between quark and gluon fragmentation . at @xmath16 energies , _ qqg _ events are distinguished by their three - jet topology . within such events , quark and gluon jets",
    "can be separated by a variety of techniques including vertex tagging . because gluons rarely fragment into heavy quarks , they will produce jets that form a vertex at the @xmath17 interaction point .",
    "quark jets , to the contrary , tend to form a detached vertex when the jet contains a long - lived bottom or charm quark . for light - quark events with gluon radiation ,",
    "however , the assignment of final state hadrons to the initial state partons is generally more ambiguous and often relies on monte carlo simulations to determine the fraction of times that an observed hadron is correctly traced to a primary parton .    within the limits of their precision , previous studies at sld found inclusive production of pions , kaons and protons to be equivalent for gluon - tagged and quark - tagged jets@xcite .",
    "opal has measured charm production at the level of @xmath18% in gluon jets@xcite , more than an order of magnitude smaller than the rate observed in quark jets at the @xmath16 .",
    "aleph@xcite and delphi@xcite both measured inclusive bottom production in gluon - tagged jets to be @xmath19 , again considerably smaller than that expected from charge counting in quark fragmentation .",
    "most directly comparable to our current work , opal has also compared inclusive @xmath20 and @xmath6 production in gluon- vs. quark - tagged jets , finding inclusive production ratios again consistent with unity ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively)@xcite .",
    "the 10 gev center of mass energy range offers a unique opportunity to probe quark and gluon fragmentation effects , without relying on monte carlo simulation to associate the final state hadrons with an initial state parton .",
    "the decay @xmath23 allows one to compare the @xmath24 system in a @xmath9 event with the @xmath25 system in @xmath5 events . in both cases ,",
    "the system recoiling against the photon consists ( to lowest order ) of hadrons that have evolved from either a two - gluon or a quark - antiquark system .",
    "the properties of the recoil systems can then be compared directly . and @xmath10 to lowest - order only ; additional gluon radiation , to which we are not experimentally sensitive , may be present in many of the events in our sample . without the ability to adequately identify additional gluons , such higher - order radiative effects",
    "are therefore implicitly absorbed into the experimental measurement . ]",
    "additionally , the radiative transitions from the radially excited @xmath11 states to the orbitally excited @xmath26 triplet offers an opportunity to further probe fragmentation differences between decays of the j=0 and j=2 @xmath26 states ( decaying predominantly to two gluons ) vs. decays of the j=1 state ( decaying primarily to qq(g ) final states , with the gluon nearly on - shell ) . statistical correlations between transition photons with inclusive production of particular final - state particles ( x ) allows a measurement of the relative yields of @xmath27:qq(@xmath28)@xmath29 x.    in this analysis , we focus on the relative production rates of baryons ( protons and @xmath6 s ) and heavy mesons ( @xmath0 and @xmath30 in gluon vs. quark fragmentation ( charge conjugation is implied ) .",
    "a previous study noted apparent enhancements in the production of @xmath0 , @xmath6 and protons in three - gluon decays of the @xmath11(1s)@xcite , albeit with low statistics and at no more than 2 - 3@xmath31 significance .",
    "that initial study also found approximately one unit larger charged multiplicity for three - gluon fragmentation of the @xmath11(1s ) compared to qq fragmentation at a comparable center - of - mass energy . with the limited statistics at that time",
    ", the additional unit of multiplicity could entirely be accounted for by enhanced three - gluonic production of baryons .",
    "we now have sufficient statistics to re - measure the three - gluon particle production rates , and also to compare , for the first time , inclusive production in two - gluon fragmentation vs. inclusive production in three - gluon fragmentation .",
    "since then , other experimental data on quark / gluon fragmentation differences in the @xmath3210 gev energy regime have become available , including ( per event ) :    1 .   a suppression of production of open charm in gluonic decays of the @xmath11 resonances : @xmath33(1s)@xmath340.02@xcite .",
    "the observation that fragmentation of the j=1 state of the @xmath26 triplet ( decaying to qqg ) results in charm production comparable to the underlying continuum ; no such charm production is observed in the two - gluon decays of the j=0 or j=2 states@xcite .",

    "this system is very efficient ( @xmath4098% ) for detecting tracks that have transverse momenta ( @xmath41 ) relative to the beam axis greater than 200 mev / c , and that are contained within the good fiducial volume of the drift chamber ( @xmath420.94 , with @xmath43 defined as the polar angle relative to the beam axis ) . below this threshold , the charged particle detection efficiency in the fiducial volume decreases to approximately 90% at @xmath44100 mev / c . for @xmath45100 mev / c ,",
    "the efficiency decreases roughly linearly to zero at a threshold of @xmath4630 mev / c . just within the solenoidal magnet coil",
    "is the electromagnetic calorimeter , consisting of 7800 thallium doped csi crystals .",
    "the central `` barrel '' region of the calorimeter covers about 75% of the solid angle and has an energy resolution of @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the shower energy in gev .",
    "this parameterization translates to an energy resolution of about 2% at 2 gev and 1.2% at 5 gev .",
    "two end - cap regions of the crystal calorimeter extend solid angle coverage to about 95% of @xmath49 , although energy resolution is not as good as that of the barrel region .",
    "the tracking system , rich particle identification system and calorimeter are all contained within the 1.5 tesla superconducting coil .",
    "flux return and tracking chambers used for muon detection are located immediately outside the coil and in the two end - cap regions .",
    "we use the cleo - iii data collected at the narrow @xmath11 resonances as a source of @xmath9 events and data taken just below the resonances , as well as the below-4s continuum ( @xmath50=10.55 gev ) as a source of @xmath51 events .",

    "we take the difference between results using these two conventions as a systematic error . ]",
    "we use data taken at the @xmath11(1s ) , @xmath11(2s ) , @xmath11(3s ) , and @xmath11(4s ) resonances .",
    "we impose event selection requirements identical to those used in our previous study of inclusive direct photon production in @xmath11 decays@xcite .",
    "those cuts are designed primarily to supress backgrounds such as two - photon collisions , qed events ( including tau pairs ) , and beam - gas and beam - wall collisions .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in order to verify our procedures and probe possible systematic uncertainties , two primary cross - checks were employed .",
    "we first compare the monte carlo enhancements at the event generator - level with those determined after the generated events are processed through the full cleo - iii detector simulation ( `` detector - level '' ) , as a function of momentum . in general , these enhancements will vary for several reasons , including differences in : a ) the efficiencies for finding recoil particles in qq@xmath52 vs. gg@xmath52 events resulting from angular distribution , event multiplicity , and particle momentum differences , b ) event selection efficiencies , c ) @xmath58 contamination levels , and d ) recoil center - of - mass discrepancies , e.g. , between the continuum data under the @xmath11(1s ) resonance vs. the below-@xmath11(4s ) continuum . in cases where the generator - level and detector - level enhancements are statistically inconsistent with each at the @xmath59 level",
    ", we use the ratio between the generator - level and detector - level enhancements as a correction factor and conservatively take half of the amount by which this correction deviates from unity as an estimated systematic error .",
    "( note that these corrections have already been incorporated into the results presented in figures and [ fig : ggginteg ] and [ fig : gggaminteg ] ) .",
    "figures [ fig : gggprodg ]    and [ fig : gggamprodg ] shows the comparison of proton enhancements determined at the event - generator vs. post - detector - simulation levels of monte carlo simulation .",
    "integrated over momentum , typical corrections are typically of order 10% .    to test the sensitivity of our analysis procedures across different running periods",
    ", we have calculated the enhancements for photon - tagged @xmath11(4s ) on - resonance events vs. photon - tagged below-@xmath11(4s ) continuum events , spanning the full cleo - iii data set . since @xmath11(4s)@xmath29bb@xmath60100%",
    ", we expect that any event having a photon with @xmath61 is a continuum event .",
    "hence , the calculated enhancement should be zero . in all cases ,",
    "save for antiprotons , we find good agreeement between the below-4s continuum particle yields per photon tag , and the on-4s particle yields per photon tag .",
    "for antiprotons , we find deviations from the null expectation at the level of @xmath6210% , and incorporate these deviations ( bin - by - bin in momentum ) into our total systematic error for that particular case .",
    "we compare , for the first time , particle production in two - gluon vs. quark - antiquark fragmentation .",
    "we find that , in particular , baryon production ( per event ) in two - gluon decays is somewhat smaller than that observed in three - gluon decays , particularly in the case of @xmath6 production .",
    "this result is qualitatively at variance with the conclusion that , e.g. , the thrust and charged multiplicity distributions of @xmath63 and @xmath64 two - gluon decays agreed well with @xmath11(1s)@xmath65 and that the thrust and charged multiplicity distribution of @xmath66 agreed with continuum @xmath3 events@xcite .",
    "this effect is not reproduced in the current jetset 7.4 monte carlo event generator . for protons , which represent our highest - statistics sample ,",
    "our results are inconsistent with a model where baryon production in gluon fragmentation is only a function of the available center - of - mass energy .",
