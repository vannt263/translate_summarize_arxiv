    "the standard model for radio - emitting active galactic nuclei ( agns ; scheuer 1974 ) suggests that there is a supermassive black hole located in the center of the galaxy and a pair of relativistic ( most probably ) electron - positron continuous beams , or jets , expanding into the interstellar and intergalactic medium of the source ( begelman et al .",
    "our current understanding of many of the collective properties of agns can be summarized by so - called unification models ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) , in which the observed properties of active galaxies are governed primarily by orientation and intrinsic luminosity .",
    "many of the apparent differences between type i ( broad - line ) and type ii ( narrow - line ) agns are believed to be due to our line - of - sight having different orientations with respect to the disk . in unified models of active galaxies ,",
    "agn nuclei are surrounded by a dusty molecular torus . in type",
    "ii agns , with the view being edge - on , the torus blocks a direct view of the continuum and broad - line region , which can only be detected through light scattered into the line - of - sight by material lying directly above the torus opening ; by contrast , in type i agns , the view being pole - on , the continuum and broad - line region can be viewed directly .",
    "this is indeed the case for most seyfert galaxies ( lal et  al .",
    "2004 ) , and , in a similar fashion , the same unified model must apply to higher - luminosity agns such as quasars .",
    "therefore , there should exist high - luminosity obscured agns ( type ii quasars ) , which would be observable up to high redshifts .",
    "these also have been postulated for several other reasons , for instance to account for the cosmic hard x - ray background ( see madau , et  al .",
    "1994 ; zdziarski et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) makes it possible to find a large number of type ii quasar candidates , and now , following zakamska et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) we have a large sample ( 291 objects ) of known / candidate type ii quasars at redshifts 0.3 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath1 0.83 .",
    "our understanding of the radio properties of type ii quasars is based primarily on first survey results ( ivezi et al .",
    "2002 ; zakamska et al .",
    "2004 ) , where less than half of the sample sources have matches with the first catalog .",
    "the results showed no radio source with complex morphology , and overall only 17 sources ( see typical maps in fig .",
    "1 ) have radio structure that appears extended .",
    "this incomplete understanding of the radio properties of type ii quasars forms the motivation of this project , which aims to obtain high - angular resolution and high - sensitivity observations of these sources . given the cosmological importance of this class of agns and",
    "how little is currently known about their basic properties , our primary goal is to establish their observational radio properties .",
    "our sample is drawn from the type ii quasars sample of zakamska et  al .",
    "this is the first complete sample of such sources , for which we understand the optical properties in great detail .",
    "our control sample of type i quasars is drawn from the palomar - green ( pg ) survey ( schmidt & green 1983 ) , whose radio properties have already been well studied ( kellermann et al .",
    "1989 , 1994 ; miller et al .",
    "the two samples have similar redshift range , and we further match them in an orientation - independent parameter , namely [ o iii ]  @xmath05007 luminosity .",
    "the radio observations were carried out in snapshot mode in a single observing run on july 2425 , 2006 , with the vla in b configuration , with two 50 mhz ifs at a mean frequency of 8.4351 ghz .",
    "this provided a typical resolution of @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "apart from our new data , we also used the first results at 1.4 ghz to compare the results , and were able to gain vla b configuration images for 57 of the 59 sources at a typical resolution of @xmath3 @xmath5 .",
    "our results are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the morphology of the radio emission is predominantly that of a compact core , either unresolved or slightly resolved , occasionally accompanied by elongated , jetlike features .",
    "we detected 36 of the observed 59 sample sources . this detection rate ( 61% )",
    "is slightly lower than , but not very different from , the detection rate for the pg sample ( 84% ) , and can possibly be improved using the technique of stacking ( glikman et  al .",
    "2004 , greene et  al . 2006 ) .",
    "the simplest sample type has as its selection criteria only a single flux limit in a chosen observing band and a chosen sky area .",
    "however , for any single flux - limited sample chosen in this way there will be an inevitable and tight correlation between luminosity and redshift .",
    "although we did not focus to fill the luminosity and redshift plane , no visible correlation is seen in our sample ( fig .",
    "2 , left panel ) . or in other words , it is therefore possible to determine in our sample whether the dependence of a given source property is primarily on redshift or on luminosity ( blundell et  al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "figure 2 ( middle panel ) shows the [ o iii ]  @xmath05007 luminosities versus the radio luminosities of the observed sample sources .",
    "no obvious dependence of the radio luminosity of an object on its [ o iii ]  @xmath05007 luminosity is seen , although many objects show upper limits on radio luminosities .",
    "this is surprising because both radio and [ o iii ]  @xmath05007 luminosities are indicators of intrinsic agn power , and seyfert galaxies predominantly show a strong correlation ( whittle 1992 ) .",
    "we therefore suspect that not all of the sample sources are dominated by agn activity , in line with the suggestion by kim et al .",
    "( 2006 ) that these sources tend to show enhanced star formation .",
    "in addition to full - resolution maps , we also make tapered maps matched to the resolution of first and use them to determine the integrated spectral indices .",
    "the distribution of spectral indices is shown in figure 2 ( right panel ) , and the median of it is similar to that of the 3c radio sources .",
