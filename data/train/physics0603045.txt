    "are related to the shift of the superstructure feature ( see fig .  [",

    "our observations lead to the striking conclusion that the entire photonic gap is shifted towards higher frequencies on ultrashort times .    to study the ultrafast behavior in more detail , we have measured time traces at two characteristic frequencies , namely the red and blue edge of the stop band that are indicated by the red traces in fig .

    "the subsequent increase is attributed to optically generated free carriers .",
    "the free carrier effect decays exponentially with a decay time of 18 @xmath17 1 ps . the reflectivity at the red edge decreases by @xmath13r= -12@xmath10 within 1 ps due to the free carrier effect . after the excitation ,",
    "the effect on the red edge decays exponentially to @xmath13r= -1@xmath10 with a decay time of 16 @xmath17 2 ps . the decay times of about 18 ps are much faster than carrier relaxation times in bulk si , likely since our photonic crystals are made of poly - crystalline silicon , whose lattice defects and grain boundaries act as efficient carrier recombination traps @xcite .",
    "we compare the switched spectra with theory for finite photonic crystals that includes the complex refractive index of the switched crystal @xmath18 .",
    "it appears that the optical properties of excited si are well described by the drude model , which is valid for moderate electron densities in the range of our experiments @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the carrier density @xmath19= 2@xmath20 @xmath21 , and a drude damping time @xmath22 of 10 fs were deduced by comparing the magnitude of the observed shift at 300 fs and the induced absorption in the stop band to exact modal method theory @xcite .",
    "we infer a large maximum change in the real part of the refractive index of the si backbone @xmath23= 2@xmath10 at the red edge and @xmath23= 0.7@xmath10 at the blue edge ; such dispersion is typical for drude effects at probe frequencies above the plasma frequency . from our calculations",
    "we obtain the differential reflectivity of the photonic crystal versus probe frequency . the calculated data ( shown as a curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3]b ) agrees well with the measured data at a fixed time delay of @xmath11= 300 fs ( filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3]b ) .",
    "both curves follow the same trend over the full bandwidth of the photonic gap . both the reflectivity decrease at low frequencies of up to @xmath13r / r= -10@xmath10 , as well as the increase @xmath13r / r= 19 @xmath10 at 9000 @xmath2 are in quantitative agreement with theory .",
    "the small reflectivity decrease of @xmath13r / r@xmath24 -1@xmath10 in the central part of the peak is also in good agreement with theory .",
    "small deviations in the calculated reflectivity occur near 7000 @xmath2 due to a calculated shift of aforementioned narrow trough .",
    "furthermore , the calculations are less accurate for high frequencies above 9000 @xmath2 .    the good agreement between the calculated and measured switched spectra is connected to the notion from photonic bandstructure theory that the band gap for our diamond - like photonic crystals appears in the frequency range of first - order stop gaps @xcite .",
    "conversely , for inverse opaline structures , the bandgap is predicted in the range of second - order stop gaps , where observed features are still awaiting a conclusive assignment @xcite .",
    "the second order range is also more sensitive to disorder @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that woodpiles are highly suitable , switchable bandgap crystals .    to verify the switching mechanism in the si backbone of our crystals , we have studied the intensity scaling of the effects .",

    "we have also plotted data for the reflectivity feature at 9750 @xmath2 .",
    "both features shift linearly with the peak pump power squared , which confirms that a two - photon process is indeed the dominant excitation mechanism . from switched reflectivity spectra at 1 ps",
    ", we deduce a large maximum shift of the stop band edges of @xmath26= 2.4@xmath10 on the red edge at @xmath27= 5500 @xmath2 , and at @xmath28= 9100 @xmath2 on the blue edge , the change @xmath29= 0.54@xmath10 is smaller , consistent with a drude dispersion of free carriers .",
    "the center position of the gap shifts by 90 @xmath2 ( @xmath9= 1.2 @xmath10 ) , which is large compared to typical linewidth of quantum dots and of band gap cavities @xcite .    from a comparison of the intensity scaling of the shift of the blue edge ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5 ] ) to exact modal method theory , we obtain a two - photon absorption coefficient @xmath30= 60 @xmath17 15 cmgw@xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding large pump absorption length in the crystal exceeds 230 layers of rods , confirming that two - photon excitation of carriers yields much more homogeneously switched crystals than in one - photon experiments @xcite .    since we have studied photonic crystals made with semiconductor fabrication techniques near the telecom frequency range , it is interesting to generalize our results and consider applications of on - chip ultrafast all - optical switching .",
    "notably important requirements are a considerably reduced pulse energy and a high repetition rate .",
    "a strongly reduced pulse energy is feasible for devices that exploit planar photonic crystal slabs@xcite such as modulators wherein a cavity resonance with quality factor q is switched by one linewidth @xcite .",
    "since the required refractive index change scales inversely with q , a small refractive index change @xmath13n/n= 1/q suffices .",
    "assuming reported @xmath32-sized 2d photonic crystal cavities with q= @xmath33 @xcite , @xmath13n/n is 100 times smaller than in our experiments . by pumping such a tiny cavity with diffraction limited pulses from above",
    ", free carriers are selectively excited inside the cavity volume only . by choosing a pump frequency of 20000 @xmath2 , which is above the electronic band gap of silicon ,",
    "a sufficiently high density of free carriers is achieved with low pulse energies of less than 50 fj , which is within reach of on - chip light sources such as diode lasers .",
    "moreover , the observed decay time of less than 20 ps implies that switching could potentially be repeated at a rate in excess of 25 ghz . at such high repetition rates ,",
    "heating of the cavity can be a serious problem . from heat diffusion theory , however , we estimate that the temperature increase in a @xmath32-sized 2d photonic crystal cavity that is pumped with 50 fj pulses at 25 ghz is less than 10 k , see appendix [ calculated heating in high rep rate switching ] . therefore , we conclude that ultrafast photonic crystal switching also opens exciting opportunities in device applications .",
    "in this paper , we demonstrate ultrafast switching and recovery of si woodpile photonic band gap crystals at telecom wavelengths by all - optical free carrier effects . in our switching experiments ,",
    "we observe a large and ultrafast blue shift of the photonic gap within 300 fs .",
    "the switched spectra agree well to theory for finite photonic crystals which includes a drude description of the free carriers .",
    "the good agreement is notably thanks to the spatially homogeneous switching scheme .",
    "we demonstrate fast recovery times of 18 ps , which are related to efficient carrier recombination in the polysilicon backbone .",
