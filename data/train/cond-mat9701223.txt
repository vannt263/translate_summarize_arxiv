    "since the original work by kramers and wannier  @xcite on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model , duality has been proven to be a powerful tool in field theory and statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the idea behind this transformation is the mapping of the weak coupling region of the system under consideration onto the strong coupling range ( and vice versa ) .",
    "the symmetries of the system under this transformation lead to important insight into the structure of the model , especially in the intermediate region of coupling constants which is usually elusive to standard treatments .",
    "dual transformations applied to the topological excitations of the system are particularly advantageous since it is possible to recast the partition function solely in terms of these degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite applied these techniques to show that the vortices in 2d xy - model can be mapped onto the charges of a two - dimensional coulomb gas .",
    "kadanoff @xcite showed that this mapping is not restricted to the xy - model , but various systems can be mapped onto coupled coulomb gases .",
    "a review of these techniques applied to a number of systems can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the past years two - dimensional josephson junction arrays ( jja )",
    "have proven to be an excellent arena for the study of a variety of phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "they are fabricated from an array of superconducting islands connected by josephson links .",
    "each island is characterized by the modulus and the phase of the order parameter , @xmath0 . upon lowering the temperature ,",
    "each island of the array goes superconducting at the bcs critical temperature @xmath1 .",
    "but , in spite of the fact that each island is superconducting , the whole array remains in a resistive state as long as the phases , driven both by thermal and quantum fluctuations , have not acquired ( sufficient ) long range order .",
    "this global phase coherence sets in at a lower temperature .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that at these temperatures the magnitude of the order parameter is fixed to its equilibrium value , and the array can be described only in terms of the phases @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the josephson coupling energy , and the summation is over nearest neighbors .",
    "the lattice model defined in eq.([2dxy ] ) is equivalent to the 2d xy - model  a planar lattice of localized planar magnetic momenta @xmath5 of unit length .",
    "it describes other physical systems as well , including planar ferromagnets , two - dimensional crystals  @xcite or two - dimensional superconducting films @xcite .",
    "the xy - model undergoes a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition  @xcite driven by fluctuations in the vortex density . for the jja",
    "this implies that the array is phase coherent ( superconducting ) below the temperature @xmath6 , which is of the order of @xmath7 ( we use units where @xmath8 ) .",
    "this is demonstrated by a simple argument due to kosterlitz and thouless . at zero temperature",
    "the lowest energy state of the system has the phases @xmath2 aligned , however , at finite temperatures the free energy @xmath9 should be minimized .",

    "the entropy of the vortex configuration is given by the logarithm of the number of possible positions of the vortex , @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the free energy of the vortex becomes negative at the temperature @xmath14 .",
    "below this temperature the phases are ordered , and vortices may appear only in bound pairs .",
    "i.e. the xy - model is in a ferromagnetic state , while the jja is superconducting . above the transition temperature @xmath6",

    "@xcite ) , i.e. @xmath25 then the hamiltonian of the array is @xcite @xmath26 the interaction between the charges in the array is determined by the inverse capacitance matrix @xmath27 .",
    "its range depends on the ratio @xmath28 ; if the capacitance to ground is much larger than the junction capacitance the charges feel an on - site interaction . in the opposite limit",
    "the coulomb interaction depends logarithmically on the distance .",

    "the two characteristic energy scales in the system are the josephson coupling energy @xmath7 , which is associated to the tunneling of cooper pairs between neighboring islands , and the charging energy @xmath30 , which is the energy cost to add an extra cooper pair on a neutral island .",

    "however , in this regime the charges on the islands are well - defined variables . in the extreme limit @xmath45 ,",
    "the interaction between the charges is logarithmic , in the same way as that of the vortices in the classical array . in this case",

    "if the capacitance to the ground is larger , no finite - temperature phase transition arises .",
    "however , we can still expect a crossover from a low - temperature phase with exponentially low conductance to a resistive phase at finite temperature .    in order to describe an intermediate situation we need a formulation in terms of both charges and vortices .",

    "the coupling has a simple physical interpretation : a change of vorticity at site @xmath20 produces a voltage at site @xmath16 which is felt by the charge at this location . the last term @xmath65 represents a spin - wave contribution to the charge correlation function .    the effective action ( [ sqv11 ] ) shows a high degree of symmetry between vortex and charge degrees of freedom . in particular , in the limit @xmath45",
    "the inverse capacitance matrix depends on distance in the same way as the vortex interaction , @xmath66 and charges and vortices are ( nearly ) dual .",
    "the duality is broken by the last term @xmath65 .",
    "this term is `` irrelevant '' for the phase transitions , i.e.  it merely shifts the transition point .",
    "but it has important consequences for the dynamical behavior .",

    "the first term represents a kinetic energy of vortices , which can be rewritten as @xmath87    a similar consideration for @xmath88 lead us to the action of a 2d coulomb gas of charges with charge mass @xmath89 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . thus , in two dimensional arrays of josephson junctions a charge - vortex duality exists . in the limit @xmath32 the vortices are well - defined .",
    "they form a coulomb gas , and can be considered as particles with masses . in the opposite limit",
    "@xmath90 the charges are the relevant excitations .",
    "the charges have the same properties as the vortices in the corresponding limiting cases .",
    "another system of increasing experimental interest is composed of two parallel 2d josephson junction arrays with purely capacitive coupling between them ( no josephson coupling  @xcite ) .",
    "we will show that in this case an even further reaching duality between charges and vortices arises .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the most interesting situation , when one array is in the quasi - classical ( vortex ) regime while the other is in the quantum ( charge ) regime",
    ". then the vortices in one layer and the charges in the other are simultaneously well - defined _ dynamical _ variables .",
    "( in contrast in a single array vortices or charges acquire a kinetic energy only after the other variable is integrated out . ) another important feature of the present system is that the strength of interaction between charges and vortices is controlled by the interlayer coupling @xmath91 and consequently may be tuned independently .",

    "we concentrate on the situation in which the array 1 is in the quantum ( charge ) regime while the array 2 is in the quasi - classical ( vortex ) regime , i.e. @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "various types of problems van be studied in these systems .",
    "if we are interested only in behavior of the vortex array ( e.g. in an experimental realization where one measures the quantities in the vortex array only ) we can integrate out all degrees of freedom related to the charge array and study an effective action for the vortex array .",
    "an analysis analogous to that presented for a single array shows that this action is essentially that of the coulomb gas  @xcite .",
    "consequently the vortex array undergoes a bkt transition , and in the quasiclassical regime its temperature is lowered due to electrostatic coupling to the charge array .",
    "a similar problem can be solved for the charge array",
    ". then the charge - bkt transition changes into a crossover , since the capacitive coupling to the vortex array leads to screening similar as capacitances to the ground .",
    "our purpose here is to consider both arrays simultaneously and to investigate the charge - vortex duality in this system .",
    "similar as in a single array , we move from a description in terms of phases to one in terms of charges and vortices , and use the duality of the resulting action to investigate the transition .",
    "we will show that charges and vortices in this system can be considered as two - dimensional dynamical particles with masses .",
    "the charge - charge and vortex - vortex interaction are essentially those of 2d coulomb particles , while the charge - vortex interaction is highly interesting .    before we proceed with the calculation it is necessary to stress the following . in the regime of interest the interlayer capacitances",
    "@xmath91 not only couple the layers , but also renormalize the capacitances @xmath108 and @xmath109 of the islands to the ground .",
    "the physical reason for this is that due to the strong fluctuations of charges in layer 2 and vorticities in layer 1 these variables are effectively continuous , and hence a coupling to the other array plays the same role as a coupling to the ground .",
    "hence the interaction between the charges in each layer has a finite range for any non - zero @xmath91 due to the screening , and the bkt transition is replaced by a crossover .",
    "on the other hand , in the limit @xmath110 the screening length @xmath111 can be very large .",
    "below we assume that these inequalities are satisfied and the range of interaction @xmath112 is large enough to make it meaningful to speak about the charge - unbinding transition .",
    "this just means that the crossover is ( exponentially ) sharp . for",
    "not so weak coupling @xmath91 this description becomes meaningless , since the crossover is strongly smeared , and the insulating phase is absent .",

    "later we will assume that the linear size of each array is much less than the range of interaction @xmath133 .",

    "the action ( [ sqv2 ] ) is the central result of this section .",

    "the most important difference is that in one layer either charges or vortices are well - defined degrees of freedom , while the action ( [ sqv2 ] ) of the double - layer array describes the system of two _ well - defined _ dynamic variables on each site  the charges in layer 1 and the vortices in layer 2 .",
    "the action shows a duality between charges and vortices ( the second term in the square brackets is small for @xmath147 ) .",
    "both kinetic terms for charges and vortices violate the duality due to the numerical coefficients .",
    "however , close enough to the transitions these terms produce only small renormalization of the transition temperature , and are irrelevant .",
    "another interesting feature of this action is that the last term , describing the interaction between charges and vortices , is also small , while in a single - layer array the interaction is always of the same order of magnitude as the other terms .",
    "it is obvious that for long - range interaction of the charges in layer 1 these also exhibit a bkt transition , and under the conditions where the action ( [ sqv2 ] ) was obtained the transition temperature does not feel the presence of layer 2 .",
    "hence @xmath148    to understand the physics described by the action ( [ sqv2 ] ) it is instructive to map this model onto the 2d coulomb gas . for this purpose",
