    "understanding meson - baryon scattering has been a very important issue for several decades , since it gives information not only on the strong interaction between hadrons but also on the origin of baryonic resonances .",
    "recently , chiral perturbation theory has been of great success in explaining low - energy meson - baryon scattering , in particular , strangeness @xmath2 channels .",
    "while @xmath3-wave @xmath4 and @xmath5 scattering can be well described by the lagrangian of leading order in the chiral expansion , the @xmath6 system requires multi - coupled channels in order to generate resonances such as @xmath7  @xcite . though chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) provides us with a theoretical and systematic framework to study meson - baryon systems , it is restricted to lower energy regimes . in order to explain the @xmath8 system quantitatively",
    ", one has to go beyond chpt .",
    "recently , there have been noticeable works on the @xmath6 systems , based on the effective chiral lagrangian : kaiser _ et al . _",
    "@xcite examined the @xmath3-wave @xmath8 system .",
    "they utilized three different types of the pseudo - potentials , keeping the low energy constants from the effective chiral lagrangian and solved the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation in the coupled - channel formalism .",
    "krippa and londergen  @xcite investigated also @xmath8 scattering , using the on - shell approximation .",
    "though ref .",
    "@xcite seems to describe the experimental data  @xcite",
    "well , threshold behavior can not be reproduced well in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 channels due to the openings of new channels .",
    "the valencia group also studied extensively the @xmath12-wave @xmath8 system  @xcite .",
    "@xcite started from the effective chiral lagrangian to construct the pseudo - potentials and used the on - shell factorization to solve the coupled - channel ls equation , employing a regularization with the three - dimensional cut - off .",
    "later ,  @xcite introduced the dimensional regularization instead of the three dimensional cut - off .",
    "they also made use of the n / d method to solve the scattering equation .",
    "lutz and kolomeitsev  @xcite investigated meson - baryon scattering in the context of the effective chiral lagrangian with the large @xmath13 counting .",
    "they introduced a minimal chiral subtraction scheme within the dimensional regularization in order to keep the covariant chiral counting rules .",
    "though there exist technical differences between these works , almost all these works showed a remarkable agreement with experimental data .",
    "thus , it is of great significance to understand some essence , if any , in dynamics of different technical methods , in particular , different regularization schemes and the role of corresponding parameters .    in the present work",
    ", we turn our attention to the dependence of the @xmath12-wave @xmath8 and @xmath4 systems on different regularization schemes .",
    "while the dimensional regularization is preferably selected in chpt , the conventional meson - exchange model  @xcite gets used to introduce form factors , which describe the extended hadron structure , as a regularization .",
    "though the dimensional regularization gains an advantage over the form factors in many aspects , in particular , in the context of renormalization and gauge invariance , it is less convenient to associate with a ls - type scattering equation .",
    "hence , in this work , we will show that the use of form factors presents almost the same results as that of the dimensional regularization .",
    "the present investigation will shed light on the meaning of the parameters involved in the regularization and will pave the way for solving the ls scattering equation without on - shell approximation in the future work by employing the form factors in place of the dimensional regularization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we shall explain the formalism of the chiral unitary model to investigate the meson - baryon systems",
    ". the analytic structure of the scattering amplitudes will be presented . in section iii",
    ", we shall give the numerical results in the @xmath14 channel with two different regularizations used .",
    "in section iv , we shall present those in the @xmath15 channel . in section",

    "( [ ombs ] ) is then written by @xmath46 where @xmath47 stands for the @xmath35th baryon energy .    in order to solve the bs scattering equation , we have to introduce the regularization to remove the divergence .",
    "we first use the dimensional regularization ( dim ) as in refs .  @xcite . for convenience without loss of generality ,",
    "the indices representing the coupled channels will be omitted from now on . employing the dimensional regularization",

    "now , we introduce form factors instead of the dimensional regularization .",
    "the form factors encode the complicated extended structure of hadrons and are usually parameterized in the form of : @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes a four dimensional cut - off parameter . in the case of @xmath56 , _ i.e. _ monopole type of the form factor ( mf ) , it is equivalent to the well - known _ pauli - villars _ regularization .",

    "[ g ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in the @xmath70 , @xmath71 channel , the tendency of the coupling strengths are as follows : @xmath72",
    "we have investigated @xmath73 and @xmath70 meson - baryon scattering , in particular , focusing on their dependence on regularizations .",
    "starting from the effective chiral lagrangian to the lowest order of the chiral expansion @xmath16 , also known as the weinberg - tomozawa term , we have constructed the pseudo - potential which is used as a kernel of the bethe - salpeter equation . in order to solve the bethe - salpeter equation ,",
    "we utilize the on - mass - shell approximation .",
    "while the dimensional regularization is widely adopted in almost all works , we introduced three different schemes of the regularization : the dimensional regularization , the monopole type form factor ( mf ) , and the dipole type form factor ( df ) .",
    "we examined first the dependence of the propagators on regularizations . while there is basically no difference among the regularizations in low - energy regions ( below 1500 mev )",
    ", we found that in higher - energy regions ( above 1500 mev ) the propagator with the dimensional regularization differs substantially from that with the monopole and dipole - type form factors .",
    "we fixed the subtraction parameters for the mf and df at the threshold point .",
    "in addition , we used empirical values of the branching ratio and the partial wave amplitudes to fit the @xmath70 and @xmath73 subtraction parameters for the form - factor regularizations . for the form factor regularizations",
    ", we have found that the on - mass - shell approximation is limited to the energy region lower that a certain energy due to the appearance of an unphysical branch cut .",
    "therefore further study with the bs scattering equation solved numerically is necessary .",
    "we first calculated the partial - wave amplitudes for the @xmath14 meson - baryon sector for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "though there exists difference between regularizations in higher - energy regions , the results were almost the same below 1500 mev .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that the propagator in the bethe - salpeter equation is rather sensitive to the regularization schemes in higher - energy region .",
    "we also calculated the total cross sections for the @xmath14 meson - baryon sector . while all three regularizatoins describe well them qualitatively , we found noticeable difference between regularizations in the total cross section of @xmath76 .",
    "the position of the resonance @xmath77 is similar to each other in all regularizaton schemes .",
    "however , the coupling strengths of @xmath77 is rather sensitive to regularizations .",
    "the resonance @xmath78 in the @xmath15 meson - baryon sector was well reproduced in the present work and turned out to be rather insensitive to the types of regularizations apart from small difference in higher - energy region .",
    "we also investigated the analytic structure of the partial - wave amplitudes and found that three poles exist in them .",
    "the regularization dependence of the the total cross sections become different according to the channels . while the processes @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 depend on the regularization schemes , even in lower momentum region ,",
    "those of @xmath82 and @xmath83 show almost no dependence on regularizations .",
    "the process @xmath84 is changed by regularizatons only in higher momentum region .",
    "the coupling strengths strongly depend on regularizatons as in the @xmath15 , @xmath71 meson - baryon sector .    in the present work",
    ", we examined the dependence of meson baryon scattering on regularization schemes .",
    "we employed three different regularizations : the dimensional regularization , the form factor regularizations with monopole and dipole types .",
    "the differences due to regularizatons found in observables are mainly due to the different behavior of the propagator @xmath53 , because of which in higher energy region the regularizations change the prediction of the observables . thus , we conclude that one need to vindicate methods used so far to describe meson - baryon processes .",
