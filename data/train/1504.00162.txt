    "the vertical beam size at the interaction point ( ip ) requires to be minimized to obtain the designed luminosity in linear accelerators @xcite , and the ffs lattice is conceived to perform the beam demagnification in the linear and non - linear regime .",
    "one of the main second order components is the chromatic effect , it is the change on path length along the line as a function of energy , changing the focal point and diluting the beam size . two different proposals to compensate this effect are : the non - local and the local correction .",
    "the non - local correction scheme @xcite compensates upstream the chromaticity in the final doublet ( fd ) .",
    "a pair of sextupoles is used in horizontally dispersive regions ( @xmath1 ) to compensate the path difference with respect to energy .",
    "in addition , they are matched to cancel geometrical aberrations , known as -i transformation .",
    "( [ f - non - local ] ) shows schematically the lattice configuration , where qf1 and qd0 constitute the fd , b0 to b5 are dipole magnets to produce horizontal dispersion , sd and sf sextupoles are used to cancel vertical and horizontal chromaticity respectively .        the local chromaticity correction scheme @xcite compensates chromaticity inside the fd and fig .",
    "( [ f - local ] ) shows the sextupoles locations . here , one of the paired sextupoles is outside the horizontally dispersive region to cancel only geometrical contributions to beamsize .",
    "horizontal dispersion is cancelled at the ip , and is generated only once upstream where the vertical and horizontal corrections share the region .",
    "this leads to a more compact design .",
    "both schemes have been compared for clic @xcite , concluding in smaller lattice length for the local scheme and easier tuning capabilities for the non - local .",
    "it has been mainly attributed to knobs orthogonality because the non - local scheme has a separated block per plane , while in the local , the horizontal and vertical correction blocks are interleaved .",
    "in the non - interleaved scheme , the idea is to preserve the separation in the vertical and horizontal chromatic corrections while cancelling the geometrical components in the vertical plane at the fd .",
    "one of the paired sextupoles is inside a horizontally dispersive region while the other remains outside to cancel geometric contributions .",
    "horizontal dispersion is generated over a common region and it is cancelled upstream , before the fd . fig .",
    "( [ f - noninterleaved ] ) shows qd0 preceded by a sextupole sd0 , which is matched with a second sd1 by the -i transformation .",
    "the same configuration is used to cancel horizontal chromaticity in an upstream section of the lattice , using sf sextupoles .",
    "following the properties of telescopic systems @xcite , a fd as in fig .",
    "( [ f - fd ] ) with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , has peak @xmath4-functions at the quadrupoles equal to @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 , using @xmath9 .        in the thin lens approximation ,",
    "chromaticity in the horizontal or vertical plane @xmath10 can be evaluated as    @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the quadrupole gradient and length , @xmath13 is the @xmath4 function at the ip and @xmath14\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    figures ( [ f - xixn]-[f - xiyn ] ) show the functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , equivalent to a normalized chromaticity in @xmath17 units .",
    "the ip beam size is increased by chromaticity as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , valid for both transversal planes .",
    "therefore , luminosity is approximately affected by the horizontal and vertical chromaticity as    @xmath20    one possibility is to minimize the addition of the horizontal and vertical chromaticities ,    @xmath21    figure ( [ f - xixy500gev ] ) corresponds to @xmath22 for clic 500 gev @xcite , @xmath23 . for a given @xmath24 , the minimum added chromaticity in the fd",
    "is found when @xmath25 is one to two times the distance to the ip .",
    "in addition , figures ( [ f - xixn]-[f - xixy500gev ] ) show the effect of scaling up the system .",
    "for example , starting at @xmath26 and @xmath27 , it is clear that a system with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , will decrease the vertical chromaticity by increasing the horizontal chromaticity .",
    "all chromatic correction schemes use a pair of matched sextupoles to cancel one another geometrical components .",
    "it is generally noted as the -i transformation .",
    "however , results from @xcite show that the -i transformation is one particular solution , and having a pair sextupoles as in fig .",
    "( [ f - sext ] ) joined by a transport matrix @xmath30 , the general solution is @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where , @xmath37 are the matrix elements and @xmath38 are the sextupole gradients . this general solution is used here to give more flexibility to the beta functions in the design .    .",
    "]    those expressions from the linear transport map set restrictions on the optic lattice parameters and tolerances during the lattice design stage . in order to evaluate those tolerances ,",
    "@xmath39 have been defined as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively , where @xmath44 is the phase advance error , @xmath45 is the residual after subtractions and @xmath46 are the optical parameters in horizontal @xmath47 and vertical @xmath48 planes for both sextupoles @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "factors @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the optic parameter , are conditions to achieve geometrical terms cancellation",
    ". the fd requires phase advances finely matched because @xmath55 and @xmath4 are high , and the residuals @xmath56 should be close to zero in order to cancel the second order map components in both planes at the same time . the @xmath57 ratio can be chosen to match sextupole strengths .",
    "using the clic 500 gev parameters , new lattices were designed in mad - x @xcite following the previous considerations and those in @xcite .",
    "( [ f - mad - x ] ) is an example .",
    "it is worth noting the change of sign in the horizontal dispersion function @xmath58 from the horizontal chromatic correction to the vertical because this makes all sextupoles to have either possitive or negative gradients .",
    "phase advances have been matched to @xmath59 precision due to high @xmath55 values in the fd .",
    "mapclass2 @xcite gives vertical beam size of 1.9 nm and horizontal beam size of 186 nm to the first order .",
    "however , fig .",
    "( [ f - beamsize ] ) shows that the horizontal beam size increases slightly to second order and by more than an order of magnitude when third order components in the map are considered .",
    "the reason to this beam size growth is the second order dispersion ( @xmath60 ) in the sextupole inside the fd , see fig .",
    "( [ f - latticet166 ] ) . as opposed to the local chromaticity method",
    "were @xmath60 is cancelled only at the ip by matching the sextupoles and dispersion function , here , the second order dispersion generates higher order components due to the sextupole inside the fd used for geometrical cancellation .",
    "this is not present in the non - local method because there is no sextupole in the fd .",
    "two possible solutions are foreseen at the moment : cancel the map components @xmath60 and @xmath61 before the fd , or alternatively tolerate some dispersion in the fd to cancel the second order map and making it similar to the local method .",
    "map component is not zero at the sextupole in the fd . ]",
    "the non - interleaved lattice proposal has been conceived as an alternative to the local and non - local chromaticity correction methods .",
    "the added horizontal and vertical chromaticity has been minimized by using a distance from qd0 to qf1 approximately one and to times the distance between qd0 and the ip .",
    "also , a general geometrical cancellation has been used to give more flexibility to the linear lattice design , however the large beta functions close to the fd impose high precision in the phase advance betweeen sextupole elements .",
    "the non - interleaved design for clic 500 gev has been diagnosed using mad - x and mapclass2 , concluding that the second order dispersion must be cancelled before the fd because of the high gradient sextupole before qd0 used to cancel geometrical components only .",
    "two solutions are foreseen : the cancellation of the second order dispersion and its derivative before the fd , or alternatively generate dispersion in the fd to cancel the residual second and third order components .",
