    "a considerable amount of the theoretical interest has been devoted last years to the investigation of electronic properties of the nano - size objects possessing regular cylindrical and spherical shapes . while most of these studies were consecrated to the various properties of carbon nanotubes , the technological advances in production of spherical objects also require further theoretical understanding of peculiar quantum effects of electronic motion in such materials .",
    "a well - known fullerene molecule , c@xmath2 , could be one of the examples , along with its further modification , so - called  onion \" graphitic structures .",
    "@xcite the spherical nano - size objects are also found in the studies of the nonlinear optical response in composite materials @xcite and of simple metal clusters .",
    "@xcite a rapidly evolving field of photonic - band - gap materials @xcite provides yet another example of spheres of about 300 nm in diameter . in the latter case , one may find silica balls with semiconducting coating ( coated opals ) @xcite , or `` inverse '' opal structures , where the initial sio@xmath3 template is chemically removed and carbon spherical shells form three - dimensional fcc structure .",
    "@xcite    in all these cases one can assume that the motion of itinerant electrons is confined within a spherical layer of a width small comparing to a radius . to a first approximation , one ignores the interaction effects and considers a situation of the electron gas .",
    "theoretical efforts in this direction comprise an analysis of the behavior of such gas on a sphere in the uniform magnetic field and an evaluation of the electronic correlations without a field .",
    "it was shown particularly that if the field is small so that the magnetic length is larger than the radius , then one can expect the jumps in the magnetization and susceptibility of the sphere .",
    "@xcite an extension of this analysis for the ellipsoid of revolution has been undertaken recently .",
    "@xcite in stronger fields , when the magnetic length is smaller than radius , one finds a series of interesting effects described elsewhere .",
    "@xcite    the electronic correlation functions for the topology of the sphere exhibit , particularly , a peculiar coherence effect when the coherence length of electronic motion exceeds the radius of the sphere .",
    "@xcite it turns out , that the amplitude of these functions is enhanced for the antipodal points on the sphere , where all partial waves of quantum motion come in phase .",
    "the electron gas approximation , employed in these works , should be violated in experimental realizations of nanospheres .",
    "one of the reasons for this violation is the effects of electron - electron interaction , which were studied in @xcite .",
    "another source of possible inadequateness of the electron gas model is the explicit absence of rotational symmetry , inferred by the presence of impurities .",
    "indeed , the experimental realization of the spherical layer , wherein the electrons are confined , might be far from the ideal shape .",
    "the inhomogeneities of various kind ( impurities , fluctuations of layer s width ) should eventually destroy the effects , found theoretically for the idealized model .",
    "as a first crucial step here , one observes that the impurities necessarily raise the multiple degeneracy of the energy levels , found initially in a quantum rotator model of a free gas .",
    "in this paper we consider the effects of potential impurity scattering in the electron gas on a sphere .",
    "we employ the model of point - like impurities , which is shown to be valid if the angular momentum of an electron does not exceed inverse angular range of the potential .",
    "our results suggest that there is a definite range of parameters , where the electron gas approximation should be applicable .",
    "particularly , this approximation is validated , when the radius of the sphere is smaller than the ratio @xmath4 , with the areal densities of electrons and impurities , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "we show that in this case the degeneracy of the initially degenerate multiplet , close to fermi energy , is lifted only partially .",
    "the unsplit states are superpositions of the initial spherical harmonics , and hence describe the electrons freely propagating along the sphere . as a result ,",
    "one expects , that for sufficiently small disorder it is possible to discuss the coherence effects , induced by the spherical topology .    for the regime of weak disorder",
    ", we numerically investigated the splitting of on multiplet , caused by random impurities .",
    "we found that the statistics of the energy levels in this case is not identical , albeit close , to the predictions of the random matrix theory for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble .",
    "particularly we show that the energy level spacing distribution follows the law @xmath7 , with @xmath8 in the limit of white - noise potential distribution .",
    "we discuss a possible reason for this deviation , related to the geometry of the problem .",
    "a rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we formulate the problem and treat the random potential perturbatively in sec .",
    "we identify here the region of parameters , where the perturbation theory fails . in sec .",
    "iii we numerically investigate this region .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "in the ideal situation the motion of an electron on the sphere is described by the quantum rotator model .",
    "the wave functions @xmath9 are the spherical harmonics @xmath10 and the spectrum is simple : @xmath11 we normalize @xmath12 on the surface of the sphere @xmath13 .",
    "the main effect of the random impurity potential is the lifting of @xmath14fold degeneracy of each @xmath15th energy level .",
    "qualtitatively , one expects that at sufficiently small disorder these split levels form a subband nearly the initial position @xmath16 , and the width of this subband does not exceed the separation between the adjacent levels @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this regime corresponds to the mean free path of the electron , @xmath18 , larger than @xmath19 .",
    "the coherence effects of the electronic motion should be still present in this case .",
    "@xcite    at larger disorder , the width of induced subband is more than @xmath20 .",
    "the different subbands overlap now and , as a result , one finds a constant density of states , typical for a planar two - dimensional electron gas . having the relation @xmath21 in this case",
    ", one sees that the spherical surface is effectively decomposed onto the `` patches '' of size @xmath18 , in which the electronic motion is essentially planar .    to find out the corresponding criterion for these two regimes , we use the green function formalism .",
    "treating disorder as perturbation , we write the self - consistent equation for the green function .",
    "the spread of the split levels around the position of the initial multiplet is described by an imaginary part of the corresponding self - energy .",
    "this approach is very similar to one employed in the analysis of splitting of the lowest landau level in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , @xcite and a reader can easily find parallels with our situation below .",
    "the green function is given by @xmath22 for the free motion this expression simplifies @xmath23 with the distance between two points on the sphere @xmath24    the basic equation is @xmath25 where we write @xmath26 for the angular distance between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , etc .",
    "the integration over the surface of the sphere reads as @xmath29 .",
    "being averaged over disorder , the functions entering the above equation depend only on the distances between the corresponding points . representing each function through its generalized fourier coefficients , @xmath30 we have @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "we consider different contributions to @xmath33 below .",

    "we are mostly interested in energies close to fermi level , @xmath38 . in this sense , we define the angular fermi momentum , @xmath39 , as @xmath40 , more precisely @xmath41    for small angular distances @xmath42 we have @xmath43       \\label{g0small}\\ ] ] with the euler constant @xmath44 .",

    "we discuss now a notion of point - like impurity on the sphere .",
    "letting first the range of the potential to be zero , we write @xmath55 .",
    "next we introduce the function describing the formfactor of impurity in the form @xmath56 , the limit @xmath57 is assumed .",

    "earlier theoretical arguments @xcite suggested that @xmath225 , later it was agreed that @xmath226 with @xmath227 .",
    "@xcite    since we deal with finite size matrices , the range of @xmath222 is restricted from above by @xmath154",
    ". actually the finite - size effects are felt at @xmath228 , where one finds a maximum of @xmath229 . the behavior of the number variance at lower @xmath222 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig - all ] .    from this figure",
    "one sees that in the case ( i ) of identical impurities @xmath229 follows the goe prediction except for the value @xmath178 . in cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) , when @xmath144 are allowed to vary , the dependence @xmath230 goes visibly above the goe law .",
    "one notices that in the case ( iii ) of nd @xmath144 the obtained @xmath229 is considerably higher than in the case ( ii ) of dichotomic amplitudes .",
    "the highest curve for the number variance is obtained again at @xmath178 , both for the case ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "the pronounced variation of @xmath229 with @xmath105 in two latter cases should be contrasted with our results for @xmath199 , table [ table1 ] .",
    "indeed , we see that the the curves for @xmath229 may almost coincide for different @xmath207 s ( at @xmath106 and @xmath177 ) , while they may be notably different for almost identical @xmath207 s . particularly , one finds almost linear dependence at @xmath231 , @xmath232 with @xmath227 .",
    "the slopes @xmath233 vary in the range @xmath234 and @xmath235 for the dichotomic and nd amplitudes , respectively .    making this observation",
    "we try to compare our system with the problems of metal - insulator anderson transition and of impurity - split lowest landau level .",
    "we mentioned the earlier theoretical expectation @xmath236 above .",
    "this possibility , numerically validated for the 3d mit @xcite is apparently not favored by our data .",
    "other studies support the viewpoint that @xmath237 with the level compressibility @xmath238 ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "a relation @xmath239 connects @xcite the quantity @xmath233 with the multifractal exponent @xmath240 , characterizing the spatial extent of the wave functions in the flat geometry of @xmath241 dimensions , @xmath242 with @xmath243 a volume of the system . for the iqhe various authors provided the values @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "@xcite    the values of @xmath233 extracted from our data are roughly consistent with these results . a pronounced dependence of @xmath233 on @xmath105 , however , requires further understanding .",
    "we suggest here that + i ) either our results obtained for @xmath246 do not describe the true asymptote of @xmath229 , ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) + ii ) or the multifractal exponent @xmath240 varies with @xmath105 .",
    "it would be interesting to check the last possibility by investigating the spatial character of the wave functions in our model .",
    "this work is however beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "we considered the electron gas on the sphere , moving in the potential field of point - like scatterers . without a disorder ,",
    "one observes a series of effects , associated with the coherent motion of the electrons in the spherical geometry .",
    "the high symmetry of a problem leads to the large degeneracy of energy spectrum in the ideal case .",
    "the disorder removes the rotational symmetry , prompting one to expect the disappearance of the coherence effects .",
    "our consideration shows that there exist a definite range of disorder parameters , where the sphere remains sphere at least partly .",
    "particularly we demonstrate that the phenomenon of incomplete raising of degeneracy may take place for sufficiently small radii . in the case of relatively small disorder",
    "the main effect is the splitting of the rotational multiplet , while the transitions between the different multiplets can be ignored . numerically investigating this latter case , we studied the energy level statistics in the impurity - induced band .",
    "we found that the energy spacing distribution function follows a modified wigner - dyson law , @xmath247 with @xmath8 in the white noise limit .",
    "our data suggest that the parameter @xmath207 does not determine the behavior of the energy levels number variance @xmath229 .",
    "the latter quantity reveals various possibilities for almost the same values of @xmath207 , depending strongly on the chosen model of disorder .",
