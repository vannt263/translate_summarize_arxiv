    "two - photon collisions provide a tool to study a variety of fundamental aspects of qcd and have long been a subject of great interest ( cf , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a peculiar facet of this interesting domain is exclusive two hadron production in the region where one initial photon is highly virtual ( its virtuality being denoted as @xmath5 ) but the overall energy ( or invariant mass of the two hadrons ) is small  @xcite .",
    "this process factorizes  @xcite into a perturbatively calculable , short - distance dominated scattering @xmath6 or @xmath7 , and non - perturbative matrix elements measuring the transitions @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "these matrix elements have been called generalized distribution amplitudes ( gdas ) to emphasize their close connection to the distribution amplitudes introduced many years ago in the qcd description of exclusive hard processes  @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the process @xmath10 which has recently been observed at lep in the right kinematical domain @xcite .",
    "we calculate the differential cross - section of the considered processes as a function of @xmath11 and compare it to the experimental data .",
    "the reaction which we study here is : @xmath12 where the initial electron @xmath13 radiates a hard virtual photon with momentum @xmath14  ; in other words , the square of virtual photon momentum @xmath15 is very large .",
    "this means that the scattered electron @xmath16 is tagged . to describe reaction ( [ pr ] ) ,",
    "it is useful to consider , at the same time , the sub - process of reaction ( [ pr ] )  : @xmath17 regarding the other photon momentum @xmath18 , we assume that , firstly , its momentum is collinear to the electron momentum @xmath19 and , secondly , that @xmath20 is approximately equal to zero , which is a usual approximation when the second lepton is untagged .",
    "let us now pass to a short discussion of kinematics in the @xmath1 center of mass system .",
    "we adopt the @xmath21 axis directed along the three - dimensional vector @xmath22 , and the @xmath0-meson momenta are in the @xmath23-plane .",
    "so , we write for momenta in the c.m . system  : @xmath24 also , we need to write down the mandelstam @xmath25-variables for the electron - positron ( [ pr ] ) and electron - photon ( [ spr ] ) collisions : @xmath26 neglecting the lepton masses , these variables can be rewritten as @xmath27 where the fraction @xmath28 defined as @xmath29 is introduced ( see , for instance @xcite ) .",
    "let us first introduce the basis light - cone vectors .",
    "we adopt a light - cone basis consisting of two light - like vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 of mass dimension @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . in other words , they obey the following conditions  : @xmath34 in this basis , the @xmath0-mesons momenta @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be written as @xmath37 as usual , we introduce the sum and difference of hadronic momenta : @xmath38 the skewedness parameter @xmath39 is defined by @xmath40 or @xmath41 notice that the relation between our definition and definition in , for instance , @xcite reads @xmath42 within this frame the transverse component of the transfer momentum @xmath43 is given by @xmath44    we now come to the parameterization of the relevant matrix elements . keeping the terms of leading twist @xmath45 ,",
    "the vector and axial correlators can be written as ( see , for instance , @xcite , where the crossed case of the generalized parton distributions in a spin-@xmath32 particles is considered ) : @xmath46 here @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the helicities of spin-@xmath32 hadrons and @xmath49 denotes the fourier transformation with measure ( @xmath50 ) @xcite : @xmath51 in ( [ par1 ] ) and ( [ par2 ] ) , the tensor structures @xmath52 and @xmath53 depend on the vectors @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath31 .",
    "notice that due to the parity invariance the tensors @xmath56 may be written in terms of five tensor structures while the tensors @xmath57 are linear combinations of four independent structures .",
    "in this section , we pass to the consideration of @xmath59 subprocess . following @xcite , the amplitude of this subprocess including the leading twist-@xmath45 terms",
    "can be written as @xmath60,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 in ( [ amp_gg ] ) , the scalar and pseudo - scalar functions ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) denote the following contraction @xmath64    the next objects of our consideration are the helicity amplitudes that are obtained from the usual amplitudes after multiplying by the photon polarization vectors @xmath65 here , in the @xmath1 c.m .",
    "frame system , the photon polarization vectors read   @xmath66 for the real and virtual photons , respectively .",
    "we will now concentrate on the calculation of the differential cross - section of ( [ pr ] ) . using the equivalent photon approximation we find the expression for the corresponding cross - section  : @xmath67 where the weizsacker - williams function @xmath68 is defined as usual  : @xmath69 and the value @xmath70 is defined as @xmath71 the angle @xmath72 in ( [ qpr ] )",
    "is determined by the acceptance of a lepton in the detector ( see , for instance , @xcite ) and the value of @xmath73 is @xmath74 at lep1 and @xmath75 at lep2 .    in ( [ xsec5 ] ) , the cross - section for the subprocess can be calculated directly  ; we have @xmath76 where @xmath77 in ( [ app ] ) , the squared and polarization summed functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 read  : @xmath80 where @xmath81 the helicity amplitude after the integration over @xmath82 is implemented may be written as @xmath83 so , the cross - section takes the form @xmath84 notice that the integrated amplitude @xmath85 is independent of @xmath11 up to logarithms .",
    "this is quite natural for the cases where the factorization theorem is applied .",
    "besides , the exact @xmath86 dependence of this amplitude remain unknown unless some modeling is used",
    ". however , the mean value theorem gives the possibility to reduce the three different integrals over @xmath86 in ( [ xsec7 ] ) to one integration .",
    "indeed , for our case the mean value theorem reads  : @xmath87 with two phenomenological parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 . because of that the values of these parameters , generally speaking , have the same order of magnitude as @xmath90 , _",
    "i.e. _ are not much less than @xmath90 , we need to keep @xmath91-parameters in the prefactors of ( [ mvt1 ] ) and ( [ mvt2 ] ) .",
    "thus , we can see from ( [ mvt1 ] ) and ( [ mvt2 ] ) that it is useful to introduce a third phenomenogical parameter as @xmath92 where the integration over @xmath86 runs into the limits dictated by the experiment .",
    "finally , the cross - section ( [ xsec7 ] ) is expressed through these three phenomenological parameters in the following simple way : @xmath93 within the analysis implemented by the l3 collaboration , the value @xmath94 is in the interval @xmath95 .",
    "hence we are able to conclude that the phenomenological parameters @xmath96 and @xmath89 may take , generally speaking , any values inside this interval .",
    "in the previous section we obtained a simple expression for the cross - section as a function of three parameters which are @xmath97 , @xmath89 and @xmath98 .",
    "let us now make a fit of these phenomenological parameters in order to get the best description of experimental data .",
    "the best values of the parameters can be found by the method of least squares , @xmath99-method , which flows from the maximum likelihood theorem ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . as usual , the @xmath99-sum as a function of parameters is written in the form  : @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the set of fitted parameters  ; @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the experimental measurements of the cross - section and its theoretical estimations  ; @xmath104 are the statistical errors .",
    "the experimental data for the cross - section of the exclusive double @xmath105 production were taken from the measurement of the l3 collaboration at lep @xcite .",
    "further , minimizing @xmath99-sum in ( [ chi2 ] ) with respect to the parameters @xmath106 we find that the set of solutions @xmath107 with the confidence intervals are the following  : @xmath108 with this the magnitude of @xmath99 is equal to @xmath109 and , therefore , we have @xmath110 the confidence intervals were defined for the case of one - standard deviation .",
    "the graphics with the experimental data and theoretical cross - section for the fitted parameters ( [ sol_chi2 ] ) are drawn on fig .",
    "the obtained value of the normalization constant @xmath98 of order one is probably related to the energy momentum conservation , which should define the scale of gda , like in two pions @xcite case . besides",
    ", notice that within l3 experiment the interval of changing for @xmath94 in the @xmath111 center of mass is fixed as @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , we are able to note , taking into account ( [ sol_chi2 ] ) , that the confidence intervals for parameters @xmath112 lie into the whole available interval for @xmath94 . in other words , we can infer that the theoretical cross - section depends on @xmath112 slightly . indeed , despite all the three terms in ( [ xsec8 ] ) are participating in our analysis , the behaviour of the cross - section is mainly dictated by the third term in ( [ xsec8 ] ) .",
    "$ ] as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "the theoretical cross - section is plotted for the best fitted parameters which are @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "experimental data @xcite come from lep1 and lep2 runs . ]",
    "data thus are in full agreement with the theoretical expectation on the @xmath11 behaviour of the cross section . because of that the effective structure function @xmath85 is independent of @xmath11 up to the logarithms , as it was said before , our analysis of the data is a direct proof of the relevance of the partonic description of the process @xmath2 in the kinematics of the l3 experiment .",
    "much more can be done if detailed experimental results are collected .",
    "for instance the angular dependence of the final state is a good test of the validity of the asymptotic form of the generalized distribution amplitudes .",
    "the spin structure of the final state , if elucidated , would allow to disentangle the roles of the nine generalized distribution amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath86 behaviour of the cross section may have some interesting features .",
    "it depends much on the possible resonances which are able to couple to two @xmath0 mesons .",
    "its fourier transform allows to have access to an impact picture of exclusive fragmentation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath116 channel may be calculated along the same lines . in that case",
    "a brehmstrahlung subprocess where the mesons are radiated from the lepton line must be added .",
    "the charge and spin asymmetries then come from the interference of the two processes . in that way one may also study the large contribution of @xmath117 continuum .",
    "these items will be discussed in a forthcoming publication .    0.5",
