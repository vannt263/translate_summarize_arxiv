    "with the accumulation of observational data from cosmic microwave background measurements ( cmb ) , large scale structure surveys ( lss ) and supernovae observations and the improvements of the data quality , the cosmological observations play a crucial role in our understanding of the universe , and also in constraining the cosmological parameters , such as the eos of dark energy models , the curvature of universe , the total neutrino masses and those associated with the running of the spectral index and gravitational waves . in our previous work @xcite , we have used the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method to constrain cosmological models from the astronomical observational data , including the wmap three - year data ( wmap3 ) @xcite , small - scale cmb data , lss data @xcite and snia essence sample @xcite .",
    "we found that the cosmological constant is consistent with the data , however the dynamical dark energy models are still allowed and interestingly the model with its eos getting across @xmath23 the _ quintom _ model @xcite is the best fit model .",
    "and we found no strong significant evidence for the non - flat universe and massive neutrino . within the @xmath0cdm model , the scale - invariant spectrum and the spectra with @xmath24",
    "are disfavored by more than @xmath18 confidence level . due to the degeneracy between the eos of dark energy and tensor fluctuation",
    ", those inflationary models excluded within the @xmath0cdm model , will revive in the framework of dynamical dark energy models .",

    "given the precision of current observations , these results are not conclusive for the time being .",
    "recently , the wmap experiment has published its five - year data of temperature and polarization power spectra @xcite .",
    "the arcminute cosmology bolometer array ( acbar ) experiment has also published its new cmb temperature power spectrum @xcite .",
    "these new cmb data can strengthen the constraints on the cosmological parameters , especially for the inflationary models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the supernova cosmology project has made an unified analysis of the world s supernovae datasets and presented a new compilation  union \" ( 307 sample ) @xcite which includes the recent samples of snia from snls and essence survey , as well as some older datasets , _",
    "etc_. in the literature @xcite , this union compilation combining with the shift parameter derived from cmb and the bao information has been used to constrain cosmological models . however",
    ", in these studies the cmb information considered is just the shift parameter instead of the full cmb data , which will lose some information of cmb and lead to a biased result @xcite .",

    "] we show the constraints on @xmath111 and the present dark matter density , @xmath56 .",
    "this result shows that the combination of union compilation ( with systematic uncertainties not included ) and other observational data yield a strong constraint on the constant eos of dark energy , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "our result is similar to the limit from wmap5 @xcite , @xmath114 ( @xmath2 ) and physically it indicates that @xmath115 is consistent with the data .",
    "furthermore , some of the quintessence models get strongly constrained , for example , the tracker quintessence model which predicts @xmath116 @xcite will be excluded by more than @xmath117 .",
    "however we notice that the systematic uncertainties of union compilation will affect strongly the error estimation of dark energy parameters @xcite . if taking the systematic uncertainties into account , we find the limit on the constant eos of dark energy is @xmath118 ( @xmath2 ) and the error bar is significantly enlarged .    for the time evolving eos , @xmath119 , in fig.[fig2 ] we illustrate the constraints on the dark energy parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 . for the flat universe , from the latest observational data we find that the best fit model is the quintom dark energy model , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , whose @xmath120 can cross the cosmological constant boundary during the evolution .",
    "but then the variance of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are still large , namely , the @xmath8 constraints on @xmath41 and @xmath42 are @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "this result implies that the dynamical dark energy models are not excluded and the current data can not distinguish different dark energy models decisively .",
    "the @xmath0cdm model , however is still a good fit right now .",
    "our results are consistent with the wmap5 group @xcite , while the upper limit on @xmath41 and lower limit on @xmath42 are slightly weaker than theirs .",
    "this difference is mainly from the supernovae datasets used .",
    "the supernovae dataset we use in this paper is the new union compilation with homogeneous analysis of the present world s supernovae data .",
    "but in ref.@xcite they use three supernovae datasets , snls @xcite , hst @xcite and essence @xcite . for each of them",
    ", they marginalize over the absolute magnitude separately , and simply add these three pieces to get the total @xmath123 .    because the parametrization of eos of the dark energy used in this paper is assumed to extend to an arbitrary high redshift , it is important to check if the energy density of dark energy component is negligible compared with the radiation density at the epoch of the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , @xmath124 . as shown by the red solid lines in fig.[fig2 ] ,",
    "the dynamical dark energy models allowed by the current data within the @xmath8 confidence level safely satisfy the limits of @xmath125 and bbn @xcite to avoid the dark energy domination in the early universe .",
    "furthermore , the null energy condition ( nec ) should also be satisfied for the eos of universe @xmath126 @xcite : @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the eos and energy density for component @xmath130 in the universe .",
    "violation of nec will lead to the breakdown of causality in general relativity and the violation of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "this requirement from @xmath131 will constrain the eos parameters of dark energy models @xcite .",
    "firstly , we consider the wcdm dark energy model . from table",
    "i , the current observational data give the present energy density of dark energy @xmath132 .",
    "if we just assume that the eos of dark energy is constant from the early time of universe to present , using the above eq.([nec ] ) , we obtain that the nec limit requires the eos of dark energy @xmath133 straightforwardly @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the current constraints on @xmath134 with and without the systematic uncertainties of  union \" compilation satisfy this limit safely . however , if we extend the period of validity of constant eos of dark energy into the future where the dark energy component will dominate the universe entirely ( namely @xmath135 ) , the nec requires @xmath136 .",
    "consequently , the phantom dark energy models ( @xmath137 ) will be excluded and the fate of universe with big rip @xcite could not happen .     and @xmath42 from the current observations ( black solid lines ) and the null energy condition ( blue dashed lines ) . in the upper panel , the parametrization of eos in eq.([eos ] ) is assumed to be a description of dark energy for the past until now . in the lower panel ,",

    "the parameterized eos @xmath138 is assumed to be valid until now , not for the future , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath139 .",
    "the reasons for doing this are i ) experimentally there are no constraints on the dark energy models for the future universe ; ii ) theoretically it is always possible to choose a different type of parametrization of dark energy eos for the future universe , such as @xmath140 for @xmath141 , which matches to @xmath138 at @xmath142 and satisfies the nec @xcite .",
    "in fact , if the current eos of dark energy @xmath143 , this scenario allows the transition from @xmath137 to @xmath144 , consequently avoids the violation of nec .",
    "one can see from the fig.[fignec ] , in this case , the nec limit does improve the constraints on dark energy parameters from the current observations .",
    "for example , the current observational data permit @xmath145 at @xmath18 confidence level , which however violates the nec limit .    in the lower panel of fig.[fignec ] ,",
    "the parametrization @xmath138 is assumed to be a valid description of dark energy model at any time from the far past to the far future .",
    "one can see from this figure , the nec puts a stronger constraint on the eos parameters of dark energy models than the observational data . for this case , the regions of quintessence and phantom dark energy models will be shrunk significantly in the ( @xmath41,@xmath42 ) space , and the nec excludes the dark energy models corresponding to the regions labelled by the phantom and quintom a with @xmath137 for @xmath146 .",
    "consequently , the models satisfying the nec include the quintessence and some of the quintom b dark energy models , which can be seen in the lower panel of fig.[fignec ] .",
    "finally we discuss the degeneracy between the dark energy and curvature . as we know",
    ", the eos of dark energy is degenerated with the curvature of universe @xmath6 @xcite . if we do not include the prior that the universe is flat , from table i and the blue dash - dot lines in fig.[fig2 ]",
    ", we can see that the constraints on @xmath41 and @xmath42 are weakened significantly and the two - dimensional distribution extends more towards the quintom b region .",
    "but the main conclusions are unchanged , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , namely , the quintom dark energy model is still mildly favored by the current observational data . moreover , in order to show the importance of dark energy perturbations in the global analysis , we do the calculation by incorrectly neglecting the dark energy perturbations . illustrated as the black dashed lines in fig.[fig2 ] , one can see that the constraints on the dark energy parameters become tighter immediately , similar to our previous results @xcite .",
    "this study shows that how biased the result will be , once the dark energy perturbations are incorrectly neglected in the analysis @xcite .",
    "constraints on cosmological parameters @xmath19 , @xmath149 , @xmath20 , @xmath6 and @xmath150 from the current observations .",
    "we have shown the mean @xmath151 errors .",
    "for the weakly constrained parameters we quote the @xmath8 upper limits instead .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the measurements on the position of first acoustic peak of cmb temperature power spectrum",
    "have been used to determine the curvature of universe @xmath6 . however , due to the well - known degeneracy between @xmath56 and @xmath6 , we have to add other cosmological data , such as the large scale structure and supernovae data , to break this degeneracy and improve the constraint . within the @xmath0cdm model , from table ii and fig.[fig3 ]",
    ", we can see that our universe is very close to flatness , namely , the @xmath8 limit is @xmath7 , which is consistent with the prediction of inflation paradigm .",
    "as we mentioned before , dark energy parameters and @xmath6 are correlated via the cosmological distance information . in the framework of dynamical dark energy models , the constraint on @xmath6 should be relaxed .",
    "based on the calculations , we can see that the combination of observational data implies @xmath10 at @xmath18 confidence level .",
    "current constraints on the inflationary parameters @xmath19 , @xmath149 and @xmath20 , as well as the curvature @xmath6 and the total neutrino mass @xmath150 , in different dark energy models : @xmath0cdm model ( blue dash - dot lines ) and runw model ( red solid lines ) . for @xmath150",
    ", we also show the limits combined with the sdss lyman-@xmath12 forest power spectrum .",
    "blue dotted lines and red dashed lines denote the @xmath0cdm and runw models , respectively.[fig3 ] ]      detecting the neutrino mass is one of the challenges of modern physics .",
    "currently the neutrino oscillation experiments , such as atmospheric neutrinos experiments @xcite and solar neutrinos experiments @xcite , have confirmed that the neutrinos are massive , but give no hint on their absolute mass scale . fortunately , cosmological observational data can provide the crucial complementary information on absolute neutrino masses , because massive neutrinos leave imprints on the cosmological observations , such as the hubble diagram , cmb temperature power spectrum and lss matter power spectrum @xcite .",
    "within the @xmath0cdm model , from table ii one can read @xmath8 upper limit of the total neutrino mass derived from the current observations , cmb+lss+sn , @xmath152 ( @xmath8 c.l . ) , which is consistent with the recent results from wmap5 group @xcite . however , there are degeneracies between the neutrino mass and other cosmological parameters , such as the eos parameters of dark energy @xcite and the running of spectral index @xcite . due to the degeneracy among dark energy parameters and the neutrino mass @xcite , in the framework of dynamical dark energy models ,",
    "the limit on the neutrino mass can be relaxed to @xmath153 ( @xmath8 c.l . ) significantly , as shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "it is well known that when neutrinos become non - relativistic at late time of the universe , they damp the perturbations within their free streaming scale . thus the massive neutrinos will suppress the matter power spectrum at small scale by roughly @xmath154 @xcite . therefore , lyman-@xmath12 forest data at small scale can significantly improve the constraint on the neutrino mass .",
    "but when we use the ly@xmath12 data , we should keep in mind on their unclear systematics right now @xcite . when including the sdss ly@xmath12 forest power spectrum @xcite",
    ", we can obtain a much more stringent @xmath18 upper limit @xmath155 in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "moreover , the heidelberg - moscow ( hm ) experiment , which is controversial for the time being , uses the half - life of @xmath156 decay to constrain the effective majorana mass and this translates to the constraint on the sum of neutrino masses under some assumptions @xcite , @xmath157 ( @xmath8 c.l . ) .",
    "we can find an obvious tension on the neutrino mass limits from between the cosmological observations and the hm experiment , which however can be resolved if the neutrino masses vary during the evolution of the universe @xcite . in order to be consistent with the observational data",
    ", the neutrino mass must be very small in the past , but has grown recently in order to agree with the hm experiment data .",
    "again , in the runw model , the limit on the neutrino mass is relaxed , @xmath158 ( @xmath8 c.l . ) , which implies the existence of degeneracy between the dark energy parameters and neutrino mass .",
    "inflation , the most attractive paradigm in the very early universe , has successfully resolved many problems existing in hot big bang cosmology , such as flatness , horizon , monopole problem and so forth @xcite .",
    "its quantum fluctuations turn out to be the primordial density fluctuations which seed the observed large scale structures and the anisotropies of cmb .",
    "inflation theory has successfully passed several non - trivial tests",
    ". currently , the cosmological observational data are in good agreement with a gaussian , adiabatic and scale - invariant primordial spectrum , which is consistent with single field slow - roll inflation predictions .    within the @xmath0cdm model , from fig.[fig3 ]",
    ", we obtain the limit on the spectral index of @xmath159 ( @xmath2 ) , which excludes the scale - invariant spectrum , @xmath160 , and the spectra with blue tilt , @xmath24 , at more than @xmath161 confidence level .",
    "when considering the gravitational waves , the latest observational data yield the @xmath8 upper limit of tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath16 . in fig.[fig4 ] we show the two dimensional constraints in ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) panel which can be compared with the prediction of the inflation models .",
    "we find that the harrison - zeldovich - peebles scale - invariant ( hz ) spectrum ( @xmath160 , @xmath162 ) is still disfavored more than @xmath18 confidence level . and",
    "many hybrid inflation models and the inflation models with  blue \" tilt ( @xmath24 ) are also excluded by the current observations .",
    "furthermore , the single slow - rolling scalar field with potential @xmath163 , which predicts @xmath164 , is still well within @xmath18 region , while another single slow - rolling scalar field with potential @xmath165 , which predicts @xmath166 , has been excluded more than @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , the tensor fluctuations and the dark energy component , through the isw effect , are correlated , which mostly affect the large scale ( low multipoles ) temperature power spectrum of cmb @xcite . in the framework of dynamical dark energy model",
    ", we find that the upper limit of @xmath20 can be relaxed to @xmath167 ( @xmath8 c.l . ) .",

    "<S> assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power law spectrum , within the @xmath0cdm model , we find that the upper limit on the ratio of the tensor to scalar is @xmath16 ( @xmath8 c.l . ) and the inflationary models with the slope @xmath17 are excluded at more than @xmath18 confidence level . </S>",
