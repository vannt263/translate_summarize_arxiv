    "it is well known that magnetized accretion disc of black hole ( bh ) is an effective model in astrophysics .",
    "the interaction between a kerr bh and the surrounding magnetic field has been used not only to explain high energy radiation and jet production from quasars and active galactic nuclei , but also as a possible central engine for gamma - ray bursts ( rees 1984 ; frank , king & raine 1992 ; lee , wijers & brown 2000 , hereafter lwb ) .",
    "confined by the magnetic field in the inner region of the disc , the magnetic field lines frozen previously in the disc plasma will deposit on the horizon in company with the accretion onto the bh , and the magnetized disc becomes a good environment for supporting the magnetic field on the horizon .",
    "blandford and znajek ( 1977 ) proposed firstly that the rotating energy and the angular momentum of a bh can be extracted by the surrounding magnetic field , and this energy mechanism has been referred to as the bz process , in which the bh horizon and the remote astrophysical load are connected by the open magnetic field lines , and energy and angular momentum are extracted from the rotating bh and transported to the remote load .",
    "+ there still remain some open problems on the bz process , and one of them is how to estimate the ratio of the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines to that of the bh horizon .",
    "macdonald and thorne ( 1982 hereafter mt82 ) argued in a speculative way that the ratio will be regulated to about 0.5 by the bz process itself , which corresponds to the optimal value of the extracting power with the impedance matching .",
    "however , as argued by punsly and coroniti ( 1990 ) , it is hard to understand how the load can conspire with the bh to have the same resistance and satisfy the matching condition , since the load is so far from the bh that it can not be casually connected .",
    "+ recently some authors ( blandford 1999 ; li 2000a , 2000b ; li & paczynski 2000 ) argued that with the existence of the closed field lines a fast rotating bh will exert a torque on the disc to transfer energy and angular momentum from the bh to the disc .",
    "henceforce this energy mechanism is referred to as magnetic coupling ( mc ) process .",
    "compared with the bz process , the load in mc process is the surrounding disc , which is much better understood than the remote load though the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) of the disc is still very complicated .",
    "+ some works have been done to discuss the influence of the bz process on the evolution of bh accretion disc ( park & vishniac 1988 ; moderski & sikora 1996 ; lu et al .",
    "1996 ; wang et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter wly ) .",
    "however mc effects involving the closed field lines were not taken into account in the previous works .",
    "in fact the closed field lines should exist on the horizon as well as the open field lines , and disc accretion should coexist with the bz and mc process . in this",
    "paper evolution characteristics of a kerr bh are investigated by considering coexistence of disc accretion with the bz and mc process ( henceforce dabzmc ) .",
    "+ in order to facilitate the discussion of the evolution of the central bh surrounded by the magnetized accretion disc we make the following assumptions : + ( i ) the disc is perfectly conducting and the magnetic field lines are frozen in the disc . the magnetosphere is stationary , axisymmetric and force - free outside the bh and the disc ( mt82 ) ; + ( ii ) the magnetic field is so weak that its influence on the dynamics of the particles in the disc is negligible , and the bh has an external geometry of kerr metric ; + ( iii ) the disc is thin and keplerian , lies in the equatorial plane of the bh with the inner boundary being at the marginally stable orbit . +",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii the rate of extracting energy from the rotating bh in the bz process ( henceforce the bz power ) and that in mc process ( henceforce mc power ) are expressed by a unified formula , which is derived by using an improved equivalent circuit based on mt82 .",
    "our result for the bz power is consistent with that derived in lwb . in sec.iii",
    "a mapping relation between the angular coordinate on the bh horizon and the radial coordinate on the disc is given in the context of general relativity and conservation of magnetic flux .",
    "in sec.iv the power and torque in the bz process are compared with those in mc process in detail . in sec.v evolution characteristics of the bh and energy extracting efficiency",
    "are discussed by using the characteristics functions in the corresponding parameter space . in sec.vi",
    "we discuss the power dissipation on the bh horizon and the bh entropy increase , and show that the excess rate of change of bh entropy does come from the total power dissipation on the bh horizon in the bz and mc process .",
    "finally , in sec.vii , we summarize our main results .",
    "two mechanisms of magnetic extraction of energy from a rotating bh are involved in our model , i.e. , the bz process and mc process .",
    "the configuration of the poloidal magnetic field of the bh magnetosphere for the coexistence of dabzmc is shown in fig.1 , where the angular coordinate of the open field lines is assumed to vary from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , and that of the closed field lines from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath1 is a parameter indicating the angular boundary between the open and the closed field lines , and the bz and mc effects vanish as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .    considering that both mechanisms arise from the rotation of the kerr bh relative to the surrounding magnetic field",
    ", we expect that the bz power and mc power can be expressed by a unified formula . in order to do this",
    "we proposed a model , in which the remote load in the bz process and the load disc in mc process are incorporated into a unified load with resistance @xmath5 and angular velocity @xmath6 .",
    "based on mt82 an improved equivalent circuit is shown in fig.2 , in which a series of loops correspond to the adjacent magnetic surfaces consisting of the field lines connecting the bh horizon and the load .    in the i - loop of fig.2 segments @xmath7",

    "considering that the bh horizon consists of two hemispheres and integrating equations ( 13 ) and ( 12 ) over the angular coordinate from @xmath59 to @xmath1 we obtain the total bz power and torque as follows : @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 in equation ( 17 ) @xmath64 is the average value of @xmath65 over the bh horizon , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are @xmath68 and @xmath22 in the units of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
