    "pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars are objects still contracting to the main sequence and surrounded by disks and/or envelopes of circumstellar dust and gas .",
    "the dust grains produce polarization by scattering ( see bastien 1996 for a review ) . in pms binary systems , the circumstellar matter may be found around each star ( circumstellar disk , or cs disk ) and/or around the binary itself ( circumbinary disk , or cb disk ) .    we have shown ( manset & bastien 2000 , 2001a , hereafter papers  i and ii ) how the linear polarization of a binary surrounded by circumstellar matter varies periodically as a function of the orbital period , and how the geometry of the disks , the nature and characteristics of the scatterers , the masses of the stars , and the orbit characteristics affect the polarimetric curves .",
    "models can be used to find the orbital inclination from those polarimetric variations ( see for example rudy & kemp 1978 ; brown , mclean , & emslie 1978 ) . the work from brown et al .",
    "( hereafter bme ) uses first- and second - order fourier analysis of the stokes curves to give , in addition to the orbital inclination , moments related to the distribution of the scatterers in the cs and cb environments .",
    "the bme formalism was developed for thomson scattering in optically thin envelopes , and for binaries in circular orbits .",
    "since polarization in pms stars is produced by scattering on dust grains , and most of the known spectroscopic pms binaries have eccentric orbits , the bme formalism can not be used a priori .",
    "however , we have shown ( papers  i and ii ) that the bme analysis can still be applied in those cases , with a few limitations .    in this context , we have obtained polarimetric observations of 24 spectroscopic pms binaries .",
    "detailed analyses were presented for the only herbig  ae / be binary of our sample , mwc  1080 ( manset & bastien 2001b , hereafter paper  iii ) , and for 14 pms binaries located in the taurus , orion , and auriga sfrs ( manset & bastien 2002 , hereafter paper  iv ) .",
    "mwc  1080 s polarization and position angle are clearly variable , at all wavelengths , and on time scales of hours , days , months , and years .",
    "stochastic variability is accompanied by periodic variations caused by the orbital motion of the stars in their dusty environment .",
    "the variations are not simply double - periodic ( seen twice per orbit ) but include single - periodic ( seen once per orbit ) and higher - order variations .",
    "the analysis of 14 pms binaries located in the taurus , auriga , and orion sfrs revealed that after removal of estimates of the interstellar polarization , about half the binaries have an _ intrinsic _ polarization above 0.5% , even though most of them do not present other evidences for the presence of circumstellar dust .",
    "various tests reveal that 77% of those pms binaries have or possibly have a variable polarization .",
    "the polarimetric variations are noisier and of a lesser amplitude ( @xmath10.1% ) than for other types of binaries , such as hot stars .",
    "we have shown that an analysis of the periodic polarimetric variations with the bme formalism to find the orbital inclination is for the moment premature : non - periodic events introduce stochastic noise that partially masks the periodic low - amplitude variations and prevents the bme formalism from finding a reasonable estimate of the orbital inclination .    here",
    "we report the complete observations and detailed analysis for the pms binaries located in the @xmath0 ophiuchus and upper scorpius sfrs .",
    "the stars were chosen mainly from the list of binaries found in mathieu ( 1994 ) , to which we added subsequent discoveries .",
    "tables  [ tab - coord ] and [ tab - spectro ] present basic information ( other names , coordinates , location ) , and spectroscopic and orbital data ( spectral type , pms type , orbital period and eccentricity , orbital inclination when known , and distance ) for 7 of the binaries located in the @xmath0 ophiuchus and upper scorpius sfrs .",
    "the binaries were observed at the observatoire du mont mgantic ( omm ) , qubec , canada , between 1995 may and 1999 june , using a @xmath2 aperture hole and a broad red filter ( rg645 : 7660   central wavelength , 2410   full width at half maximum ) .",
    "polarimetric data were taken with beauty and the beast , a two - channel photo - electric polarimeter , which uses a wollaston prism , a pockels cell , and an additional quarter - wave plate .",
    "the data were calibrated for instrumental efficiency , instrumental polarization ( due to the telescope s mirrors ) , and zero point of position angle , using a glan - thomson prism , non - polarized standard stars , and polarized standard stars , respectively . on average , the instrumental polarization was very low ( less than 0.020% @xmath3 0.015% , never above 0.03% ) and negligible , which simplifies the determination of both instrumental polarization and origin of position angle .",
    "the observational errors were calculated from photon statistics , and also include uncertainties introduced by the previously mentioned calibrations .",
    "the final uncertainty on individual measurements of the polarization @xmath4 is usually in the range 0.030.05% .",
    "the relative errors in position angle @xmath5 can be as low as 0.1 , but due to instrumental effects , systematic errors , and the calibration procedure itself , the absolute errors on the position angles are of the order of 1@xmath6 . for more details on the instrument and the observational method ,",
    "see manset & bastien ( 1995 , 2001b ) and manset ( 2000 ) .",
    "table  [ tab - averpol ] summarizes the observations and gives the average polarization and position angle along with the number of observations .",
    "data were also obtained in 1994 with the polarimeter sterenn at the 2-meter bernard - lyot telescope of the observatoire du pic - du - midi ( opdm ) , france .",
    "this 2-channel polarimeter uses a half - wave plate rotating at 20  hz and a wollaston prism , along with s-20 photo - multiplier tubes sensitive to the @xmath7 domain .",
    "a johnson @xmath8 filter was used , along with a 10  aperture hole .",
    "instrumental efficiency and instrumental polarization were measured with polarized and non - polarized standard stars , respectively .",
    "the observational errors were calculated from the fit of the observations to a sinusoid function , and range between 0.05% and 0.10% on individual measurements .",
    "polarimetric observations are usually a sum of interstellar ( and sometimes also intra - cluster ) and intrinsic polarizations .",
    "an estimation of the interstellar ( is ) polarization for each object observed can be used to assess the presence of intrinsic polarization .",
    "we have used the heiles ( 2000 ) catalog of over 9000 polarization measurements to determine if the observed polarization for the pms binaries studied here is of intrinsic or is origin , or a combination of both .",
    "this catalog is an improvement over the one from mathewson et al .",
    "( 1978 ) : it contains additional observations , all data have been verified , and more precise coordinates are given .    for each observed pms binary , the catalog was scanned to select at least @xmath920 stars _ with a similar distance_. depending on the stellar density and number of measurements in the catalog , this led to the selection of a region between 6  and 10  in radius around the target , and within 62 to 80  pc of it .",
    "the stars selected from the catalog are used to compute an average of the is polarization in that region around the target , and also to find an average ratio of the polarization to color excess @xmath10 .",
    "the is position angle is calculated with a simple average and with a distance - weighted average of the polarization of all the stars selected ; this method also gives more weight to high is polarization values ( for which the position angle is well determined ) than to low polarization values ( which have poorly - determined position angles ) .",
    "in all the cases here , the two is position angle values are similar within their uncertainties , which indicates that the alignment is generally good over all of the region studied , and that the is polarization value estimated is reliable .",
    "however , if the is position angles are not well aligned , the average is polarization value @xmath11 will be too low ( since the vectors cancel out ) .",
    "we therefore use a different method to find the is polarization and @xmath12 are not related by their usual relation , @xmath13 . ] . based on an extinction value for the targets and assuming that this extinction is of is origin only , an estimate of the is polarization is found from the average ratio @xmath10 .",
    "if the position angles for the is polarization and for the target are different , it points to an intrinsic origin for at least part of the polarization measured .",
    "intrinsic polarization is also deduced from polarimetric variability .",
    "results are presented in table  [ tab - averpol ] , where the weighted averages of the observed @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the binaries are given along with the possible origin of the observed polarization : a @xmath14 symbol indicates intrinsic polarization while is stands for interstellar polarization includes the correct interstellar polarization and intrinsic polarization estimates for the binaries presented in paper  iv , in which the values of @xmath11 given were computed with an inappropriate method ( vectorial average of the polarization ) .",
    "thus , paper  iv under - estimated the is polarization . ] .",
    "when is comes before a @xmath14 symbol , the is component of the polarization is probably stronger than the intrinsic one , and vice versa .",
    "the following columns present our calculation of the is polarization ( polarization and position angle , along with their uncertainties ) , based on the method presented above .",
    "we also give @xmath15 , the number of measurements used to estimate this is polarization , and the radius and the interval of distance of the region considered .",
    "subtracting the is polarization from the observed one gives the intrinsic polarization , shown in the last columns .",
    "note that the is polarization given in columns 69 of table  [ tab - averpol ] is only an _ estimate _ for the _ whole region _ around a binary , and in some cases might not apply to a given binary .",
    "in particular , it may include cs or intra - cluster material and then over - estimates the is polarization .",
    "consequently , the intrinsic polarizations given in the last columns should be considered crude estimations only , intended to give an idea of the polarimetric characteristics of the observed binaries as a whole , and not definitive values of the intrinsic polarization for each binary .    to determine if an observed polarization has an is component , we give more weight to the value of @xmath12 deduced from neighboring stars than to",
    "@xmath11 which depends on the value @xmath16 given to a target . since @xmath11 can include the effect of cs material and not just that of is dust , it is less reliable .",
    "we do not have the wavelength dependence of the polarization , which can usually be used to extract the is component . to help determine",
    "if there is an intrinsic component of polarization , we also use the level of polarimetric variability since is polarization is stable .",
    "since a majority of single pms stars are variable polarimetrically ( bastien 1982 ; drissen , bastien , & st - louis 1989 ; mnard & bastien 1992 ) , we also expected pms binaries to be polarimetrically variable , either periodically or not . we have found that 77% of our 14 pms binaries located in the taurus , auriga , and orion sfrs are variable or suspected variable .",
    "various tests were applied to check the polarimetric variability or stability of pms binaries : minimum and maximum values , variance test , @xmath17 test , and finally , a @xmath18 test .",
    "one crude but easy way to check for variability in a set of observations is to compare the difference between the maximum and minimum values of a quantity with its average or typical observational uncertainty ; variable observations will have maximum and minimum values well outside the range expected from the observational uncertainty .",
    "one can calculate the variance of the sample ( which is a measure of the `` width '' of the observations , or of the scatter from the mean , or of the `` variability '' around a central value ) , and compare it to the standard deviation of the mean , which gives the error from photon statistics as if all the observations had been added together . for a set of observations of a non - variable quantity , the sample variance will be low ( the observations are all clustered closely to the mean ) and similar to the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "but if there is variability , the `` width '' of the observations will be greater than the standard deviation of the mean .    for the @xmath17 test , if the data are `` well behaved '' or `` consistent '' , @xmath19 within its standard error @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath17 differs from @xmath21 , then there may be variability .",
    "lastly , @xmath18 values are calculated for @xmath22 and @xmath23 separately , using 1@xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the probability of obtaining a given value of @xmath18 in a gaussian distribution is found for each of the four @xmath18 values .",
    "we define the criteria as follows : the star is variable if at least 2 of the four @xmath18 values are over 0.95 ; the star is suspected to be variable if one out of four @xmath18 values is over 0.95 .",
    "we developed in paper  iv a protocol on how to interpret the results of these tests in order to assign the polarization of a star as being variable , suspected variable , possibly constant , or constant .",
    "we refer the reader to paper  iv for more information .",
    "many pms binaries in this sample and in the taurus , auriga , orion sample ( paper  iv ) show observations with polarization levels and/or position angle well below or above the bulk of the data .",
    "we call these observations `` atypical '' but they are nonetheless real",
    ". close examination of polarization observations taken over 5 years of non - polarized standard stars ( 84 observations ) , polarized standard stars ( 53 observations ) , 3 stars that were followed for many consecutive hours ( 121 observations ) did not show atypical observations like the ones we repeatedly saw for pms binaries ( manset 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , we believe these atypical observations were due to some eruption - like events or significant modifications in the cs environment ( e.g. , formation / destruction of condensations , accretion events ) , and not because of instrumental problems . since this study of binary pms stars is more concerned with orbit - induced , `` typical '' , polarimetric variations than with random , atypical ones , we have removed the atypical observations before using the variability tests . this allows us to study the more typical variations .",
    "table  [ tab - ampvar ] presents the amplitude of the polarimetric variations for all binaries of our sample , including mwc  1080 ( paper  iii ) , the binaries located in the taurus , auriga , and orion sfrs ( paper  iv ) , and 2 systems which will be presented in future papers .",
    "the amplitudes were calculated by simply taking the difference between the minimum and maximum values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; note that for some cases , atypical observations were not considered so that the more typical variations could be characterized .",
    "the variations ( in @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) generally have amplitudes up to 0.3% .",
    "two binaries , ntts  162814 - 2427 and ntts  162819 - 2423s , present much higher variations , at the 1% level .",
    "this indicates that , first of all , there is enough dust in the environment of these 2 systems to produce the polarization , and second , that the configuration is favorable to high - amplitude variations .",
    "since these variations are not clearly periodic , an alternative explanation would rely on these systems being very active ( eruptive - like events , strong modifications of the cs environment ) and not on orbit - induced variations . in our previous numerical simulations ,",
    "the highest amplitude variations were produced with cs disks instead of cb disks , but we were not able to produce variations above a few tenths of a percent ( paper  ii ) .",
    "the details of the variability tests are shown in table  [ tab - vardetails ] , where we give for each star the number of observations used for the variability tests , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath17 and its standard error , and @xmath28 , calculated with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the conclusions of the variability tests are shown in table  [ tab - var ] , where we have classified the stars as `` variable '' , `` suspected variable '' , and `` possibly constant '' . of the 7 binaries , 3 are statistically variable ( ntts  160814 - 1857 , ntts  162819 - 2423s , and ntts  162814 - 2427 ) and",
    "the others are suspected to be variable ( ntts  155808 - 2219 , ntts  160905 - 1859 , haro  1 - 14c , ntts  155913 - 2233 ) . when combined with the results from papers  iii and iv , 90% of the pms binaries ( 19/21 ) are variables or suspected variables , in agreement with the results found by bastien ( 1988 ) and mnard & bastien ( 1992 ) for a sample of mostly single pms stars .",
    "in addition to the general variability , which is a known property of single pms stars , pms binaries will also present periodic polarimetric variations caused by the orbital motion , even if in some cases the amplitude may be too small to be detected with the currently available instruments or masked by non - periodic or pseudo - periodic variations . in the case of mie scattering , we have also shown in paper  ii that dust grains , which are mostly responsible for the polarization , are less efficient polarizers and produce smaller amplitude variations than electrons .",
    "this is an indication that periodic polarimetric variations could be more difficult to observe in pms binaries than in , for example , hot binaries surrounded by electrons , which can easily exhibit variations of a few tenths of a percent ( see for example robert et al .",
    "1990 ; robert et al .",
    "the size of the grains also determines the amplitude of the polarimetric variations : dust grains with radii @xmath31 produce the largest polarimetric variations ( paper  ii ) .    to look for periodic polarimetric variations ,",
    "the known orbital periods are used to calculate the orbital phase for each measurement . the polarization @xmath4 , its position angle @xmath5 , and the stokes parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are plotted as functions of the orbital phase ( see figures  [ fig - n155808 ] , [ fig - n155913a ] @xmath32 [ fig - n160814 ] , [ fig - n160905a ] @xmath32 [ fig - haro ] , [ fig - n162814a ] @xmath32 [ fig - n162819 ] ) . when enough data are available , observations are represented as first and second harmonics of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the orbital phase :",
    "+ @xmath35 the coefficients of this fit are then used to find the orbital inclination , following the bme formalism and using the first and second order fourier coefficients : + @xmath36 ^ 2 & = & \\frac{(u_1+q_2)^2 + ( u_2-q_1)^2}{(u_2+q_1)^2 + ( u_1-q_2)^2 } \\label{eq - io1-p5 } , \\\\ \\left [ \\frac{1-\\cos",
    "i}{1+\\cos i } \\right]^4 & = & \\frac{(u_3+q_4)^2 + ( u_4-q_3)^2}{(u_4+q_3)^2 + ( u_3-q_4)^2 } \\label{eq - io2-p5}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the representation with sinusoids is a useful representation of orbit - induced variations , and is not used only to apply the bme formalism .    for 5 of the 7 binaries , we have enough data to look for periodic variations , and some of them do show periodic variations ( see below )",
    ". however the curves representing the fits made according to eq .",
    "[ p5-eq - qfit ] and [ p5-eq - ufit ] do not always represent the observations well , for various reasons .",
    "effects induced by dust instead of electrons as scatterers , elliptical instead of circular orbits , and variable absorption effects may produce variations which may not be well represented by the first and second harmonics only .",
    "the fitted curves are nevertheless a useful representation of the data and illustrate how the bme formalism , extended by the numerical simulations of papers  i and ii , can be applied .",
    "periodic polarimetric variations can be caused by the binarity ( orbital motion ) or the presence of hot or cool stellar spots , among a few reasons .",
    "classical t  tauri stars ( ctts ) are known to have both cool and hot spots , and wtts generally have only cool spots ( bouvier et al .",
    "1993 ) , some of which can be stable over periods of several months ( on v410 tau for example , herbst 1989 ) . since all the binaries observed here are wtts and in general display only small photometric variations , we believe that the spots causing the photometric variations , if present , are small , and have a very small effect on the polarization .",
    "in addition to stellar spots , non - periodic phenomenons such as eruptive events , variable accretion and rearrangements of the cs or cb material can cause pseudo - periodic polarimetric variations that may mask the strictly periodic ones , especially if the observations are taken over many orbital periods , as is the case here .    despite these difficulties ,",
    "some binaries present periodic variations : ntts  160814 - 1857 , ntts  162814 - 2427 , ntts  160905 - 1859 ( for short intervals of time ) , and ntts  155913 - 2233 ( low - amplitude variations seen when the data are binned ) . to investigate the significance of this periodicity , a phase dispersion method ( stellingwerf 1978 ) and a lomb normalized periodogram algorithm ( press et al .",
    "1997 ) were used . the phase dispersion method ( pdm )",
    "is a least - squares fitting technique suited for non - sinusoidal time variations covered by irregularly spaced observations , and finds the period that produces the least scatter about the mean curve .",
    "the lomb normalized periodogram ( lnp ) method is more powerful than fast fourier transform methods for uneven sampling , but still assumes the curve is sinusoidal , which may not be always appropriate for the polarimetric observations presented here .",
    "the periods found by using both methods are very similar to one another for a given star , but the significance is usually marginal .",
    "ntts  162814 - 2427 presents single - periodic variations readily seen in position angle and @xmath23 ( see figure  [ fig - n162814b ] ) .",
    "the pdm finds in the position angle data a period of @xmath37 , and the lnp has two peaks , at 35.7 and @xmath38 , but those 3 peaks are local extrema with other periods coming up with similar significance .",
    "therefore , we can not attribute a strong significance to those peaks . when using the binned data instead of the whole set of observations , the lnp recognizes the presence of periodicity and the period found has a 60% probability of not coming from random gaussian noise , which is only slightly better than chance .",
    "those periods compare rather well with the known orbital period of @xmath39 .",
    "ntts  162814 - 2427 does show variations with amplitudes of a few tenths of a percent .",
    "our numerical simulations can produce amplitudes of @xmath10.1% if there is a cs disk but no cb disk .",
    "ntts  162814 - 2427 shows strong single - periodic variations , which we attribute to the large orbital eccentricity . for most of the other binaries ,",
    "the presence or absence of @xmath40 variations , and the exact cause of the single - periodic variations , if present , are harder to determine .",
    "we will now discuss individual stars .",
    "the detailed observations are presented in tables  [ tab - n155808 ] to [ tab - n162819 ] and in figures  [ fig - n155808 ] to [ fig - n162819 ] .",
    "this 16.95-day binary ( mathieu 1994 ) has a projected separation of 0.048  au ( jensen , mathieu , & fuller 1996 ) , and there is a tertiary component ( mathieu , walter , & myers 1989 ; walter et al .",
    "the radial velocity measurements exclude membership in the upper scorpius association ( walter et al .",

    "data for ntts  155808 - 2219 are presented in table  [ tab - n155808 ] and figure  [ fig - n155808 ] .",
    "the statistical tests conclude that the average polarization at 7660 , 0.48% at 139 , is possibly variable ( see tables  [ tab - vardetails ] and [ tab - var ] ) .",
    "this conclusion is based on only four observations that show a constant polarization but one position angle well above the others . from the polarization catalog of heiles ( 2000 ) ,",
    "we find an average is polarization of @xmath41% at 88  ( see table  [ tab - averpol ] and the map on figure  [ fig - sco3 ] ) .",
    "this value was found by averaging the polarization of 22 neighboring stars located within 6  and 80  pc of ntts  155808 - 2219 .",
    "the binary presented in the next section , ntts  155913 - 2233 , is 0.35  from ntts  155808 - 2219 and also has a very similar polarization , 0.49% at 124 , which points to a common is polarization for both binaries . since the observed and is position angles are different and ntts  155808 - 2219 is possibly variable , we conclude that its polarization is the sum of intrinsic and is polarization .      this 2.42378-day binary ( mathieu et al . 1989 ) is a double - lined system ( prato & simon 1996 ) with a separation of 0.014  au ( jensen et al .",
    "a weak tertiary component was detected spectroscopically ( mathieu et al . 1989 ) and found to be at large distance from the binary since its effect on the velocities of the binary or the tertiary itself was not detected .",

    "the polarization is similar at 7660  and 5550 .",
    "statistical tests do not indicate any variability at 5550 , but this might be due to the small number of observations and the relatively high uncertainties . at 7660 , the binary seems to be more variable than at 5550 ; statistical tests indicate that ntts  155913 - 2233 is possibly variable ( table  [ tab - var ] ) .",

    "no periodic variations are seen",
    ". there might be two different epochs , one from 1995 may to 1996 may and having a peak in polarization at phases 0.3 - 0.4 , and the second from 1997 april to 1997 june , with a peak at phases 0.5 - 0.6 .",
    "however , the data from these two epochs do not show any more periodic variations than all of the data combined .",

    "data obtained at 5550 , presented in figure  [ fig - pic155913 ] , show a systematic ( as opposed to random ) variation of the position angle .",
    "these variations cover a different time interval and are not similar to those seen at 7660 .",
    "two atypical observations are not shown in the figures for the 7660data and were not used in the variability calculations .",

    "the first atypical observation has a polarization lower than the rest of the data , but the second has a polarization very similar to the general polarization observed .",
    "we believe these 2 atypical observations are evidence for significant transient changes in this system , an eruptive - like event at the surface of one of the stars or a change in the matter distribution , for example .",
    "such atypical polarizations or positions angles have been observed before in the haebe binary mwc  1080 ( paper  iii ) and other pms binaries ( paper  iv ) .",
    "these non - periodic variations are also in agreement with the general polarimetric variability observed in single pms .",

    "it is again seen that the quality of the data is not very good , mostly because the amplitude @xmath72 is rather low ( between 0.02 and 0.10% in general ) .",
    "finally , following our own studies of the effects of noise on the bme results ( paper  i ) , we have calculated the noise for the stokes parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 , by using the variance of the fit and the amplitude of the polarimetric variations ; these amplitudes are computed from the maximum and minimum values of the observations , and not those of the fit .",
    "these calculations are presented in columns 4 and 5 of table  [ tab - noisebme ] , where levels of noise below 10% are non - existent . once again",
    ", this analysis shows that the polarimetric observations of pms stars are not of `` very good quality '' , not because of instrumental or observational problems , but because non - periodic stochastic polarization variations and low - amplitude periodic variations make the data rather noisy , hiding whatever periodic polarimetric variations exist .",
    "future observations should be obtained at a site offering many consecutive clear nights to cover in one run the whole orbital period .",
    "a more interesting case will be presented in a future paper ( manset & bastien , in preparation ) .",
    "ak  sco was observed within a few ( 12 ) consecutive nights , and shows polarimetric variations of greater amplitude .    assuming the bme formalism can be used to analyze the polarimetric variations of binary pms stars , we have added in table  [ tab - noisebme ] the results of the bme analysis for the orbital inclination .",
    "most of the inclinations are near 90 , which can not be a real result .",
    "this is compatible with the above discussion on the effects of the stochastic noise on the inclination analysis .",
    "in addition to the orbital inclination , the bme formalism returns @xmath74 , the orientation of the orbital plane with respect to the plane of the sky , and moments of the distribution of the scatterers which are used to measure the asymmetry with respect to the orbital plane ( @xmath75 ) , and the degree of concentration towards the orbital plane ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "it is generally expected that the distribution will be symmetrical to and concentrated in the orbital plane , so @xmath77 . in table",
    "[ tab - omegagammas ] , we present the values of @xmath74 , @xmath76 , @xmath75 , and the ratio @xmath78 .",
    "if the circumbinary disks of these binaries can be imaged ( with interferometric or adaptive optics techniques ) , their orientation should be similar to @xmath74 , although the orbits are not necessarily coplanar with the disks or envelopes .",
    "the values for @xmath79 and @xmath76 are similar to those we have found in numerical simulations ( paper  i ) , and to the observed values for other types of binaries ( bastien 1988 ; koch , perry , & kilambi 1989 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath77 as expected , with ratios approximately from 1.0 to 3.5 .",
    "these parameters are also calculated using the coefficients of the fits and the same assumptions ( the scatterers are electrons , the orbits are circular ) .",
    "however , single - periodic variations that are not present when the scatterers are electrons and the orbits are circular , do appear in our simulations when there are dust grains instead of electrons , when variable optical depth effects are considered , or when the orbits are eccentric ( papers  i and ii ) .",
    "therefore , the values of the parameters calculated might not reflect an asymmetric configuration ( @xmath75 ) or a concentration toward the orbital plane ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "for example , we have found , using the code presented in papers  i and ii , that even though @xmath75 should be null for a perfectly symmetric configuration , it will not be so if we have dust grains or consider variable optical depth effects .",
    "to study correlations between variations and orbital parameters ( period and eccentricity ) , the maximum and minimum values ( excluding the atypical observations ) were used to calculate @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and ( @xmath84 for all the binaries of this study ) , and compare them to the orbital period and eccentricity ; see table  [ tab - ampvar ] , figures  [ fig - var_vs_logp ] , [ fig - var_vs_ecc ] , and [ fig - dqdu_vs_logpecc ] .",
    "note that in these figures , the quantity @xmath85 for some stars is not meaningful since their polarizations are very low , and hence , their position angles not well defined .",
    "there are no clear correlations between the polarimetric variations and the orbital characteristics , although the most variable pms binaries have intermediate periods ( 10100 d ) and intermediate eccentricities ( 0.30.5 ) .",
    "the converse is not true , and there are examples of binaries with intermediate period or eccentricity which do not present high variations .",
    "one should not forget , however , that orbital inclination strongly affects the variability ; a binary which should display a high level of variability because of , say , its orbital eccentricity , might not do so because its orbital inclination is masking the variations .    important variability for long orbital periods",
    "is not expected , since the angular dimension of the cs disk as seen by the other star decreases as distance increases , making the variations in scattering angles smaller , and thus the polarimetric variations themselves smaller ; this has been verified using the numerical codes presented in papers  i and ii . moreover , the long - period binaries with periods over @xmath86 d have probably not been adequately sampled to assess the polarimetric variability over a full orbit .",
    "these two reasons could explain the drop in variability for periods longer than about 100 d. the most variable binaries all have high orbital eccentricities , @xmath87 .",
    "the 2 stars with high eccentricity but low - amplitude variations , haro  1 - 14c and ntts  045251 + 3016 , also have long periods ( 591 and 2530 d respectively ) , which might explain why more variability is not seen .",
    "correlation between polarimetric properties and stellar age is difficult to study because many factors introduce uncertainties in the derived ages .",
    "first , the presence of unresolved companions , which increases the total luminosity , can artificially lower the derived age ( simon et al .",
    "second , the choice of evolutionary tracks affects the estimated ages , as well as uncertainties in extinction or distance ( walter et al . 1994 ; forestini 1994 ; dantona & mazzitelli 1994 ) .",
    "third , hartmann et al . (",
    "1991 ) have suggested that prolonged disk accretion can arrest the evolution so the true age is greater than the one found by the location of a star in the hr diagram .",
    "so a binary can have a low polarization because it is old and has lost its cs material , or because it is still young but did not have much material to accrete due to an earlier sn explosion for example .",
    "this discussion also does not take into account the effects of inclination on the level of polarization .",
    "we could look for correlations for binaries whose age are derived from the same evolutionary tracks , but since many other factors influence the polarization level , we have not tried to do so .",
    "our numerical simulations show that , as the orbital eccentricity increases , variations go from being double - periodic ( seen twice per orbit ) to being single - periodic ( seen only once per orbit )",
    ". therefore , as @xmath88 increases , the ratio of single - periodic over double - periodic variations ( 1@xmath89/2@xmath89 ) should start from zero and increase .",
    "however , the inclination also plays a role in the amplitude of the variations and can decrease them .",
    "table  [ tab - lambda ] and figure  [ fig - ratiolambdae ] show this ratio for @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , and all the binaries we have studied .",
    "no correlation is seen , although this might be due to the presence of noise in the observations .",
    "one of the highest - eccentricity binaries , ntts  162814 - 2427 ( @xmath88=0.48 ) does present strong single - periodic variations in @xmath5 and @xmath23 , which is consistent with the results of our numerical simulations .",
    "other factors , though , can produce single - periodic variations : geometry , variable absorption effects .",
    "we have presented polarimetric observations obtained at 7660  and 5550  for 7 spectroscopic pms binaries located in the @xmath0  oph and upper sco star forming regions ( sfrs ) .",
    "all binaries have detectable linear polarizations and most are significantly affected by interstellar ( is ) polarization .",
    "ntts  162814 - 2427 and ntts  162819 - 2423s have high intrinsic polarization and are 02 from one another ( 0.22  pc at a distance of 125  pc ) , so intra - cluster or very localized polarization might also contribute to the observations .",
    "since it does not affect haro  1 - 14c located 05 away ( see below ) , this localized polarization would affect about 1  pc around ntts  162814 - 2427 and ntts  162819 - 2423s .",
    "after an estimate of this is polarization is removed , all binaries present intrinsic polarizations @xmath90 at 7660 .",
    "two binaries which , based on their sed and in particular their nir excesses , have detectable amounts of dust , ntts  162814 - 2427 and ntts  162819 - 2423s , also have the highest intrinsic polarization ( @xmath912.1% ) , which might include some intra - cluster polarization",
    ". the amplitudes of their variations ( 0.51.0% ) also indicate strong intrinsic polarizations .    of the 22 t  tauri and",
    "herbig ae / be binaries studied so far ( papers  iii and iv , this paper ) , 68% ( 15/22 ) have intrinsic polarization above 0.5% at 7660 .",
    "many of those binaries do not present any evidence other than polarimetric for the presence of dust , indicating that polarimetric techniques are more sensitive to the presence of dust than photometric or spectroscopic ones .",
    "most of the binaries with intrinsic polarizations below 0.5% are located in the tau , aur , ori sfrs , suggesting that these regions might be older than the sco and oph ones .",
    "all binaries located in the sco and oph sfrs are statistically variable or possibly variable.when considering the binaries previously studied in papers  iii and iv , and for which we have enough observations , including data from the literature ( @xmath71=21 ) , 53% ( 11/21 ) are clearly variable , and 90% ( 19/21 ) are variable or possibly so .",
    "these numbers include variability seen in the periodic variations but not detected by the statistical tests , and agree with results for single stars ( bastien 1988 , mnard & bastien 1992 ) .",
    "all the known ctts binaries in our sample ( except dq  tau for which we only have one measurement ) and many ntts and wtts present polarimetric variations .",
    "three stars of the oph and sco sfrs have shown , twice , and at 7660atypical values of polarization and/or position angle that are well below or above the rest of the data ( ntts  155913 - 2233 , ntts  162814 - 2427 , ntts  160905 - 1859 ) .",
    "these atypical observations were also detected in our previous samples ( par  1540 , par  2494 , and mwc  1080 ) .",
    "we believe these are real observations of events that strongly affected the stars and/or their environment . for the stars with a sufficient amount of data ,",
    "additional observations at similar phases indicate that these atypical points are not related to the normal periodic behavior .",
    "interestingly , in the sco and oph sample , only the shortest period binaries ( @xmath92 36  d ) have shown these atypical observations ; the other 2 cases , with periods of 89 and 144  d , did not show any such atypical observations .",
    "although atypical observations could possibly be detected with more observations , this might indicate that the atypical observations are caused by the close proximity of the stars , in particular , the interaction between their cs disks .",
    "a few of the pms binaries present periodic polarimetric variations , despite the noise introduced by non - periodic or pseudo - periodic variations .",
    "statistical tests conclude that ntts  155913 - 2233 s polarization is possibly variable , and low - amplitude periodic variations are seen when the data at 7660  are binned to minimize the noise .",
    "ntts  160814 - 1857 presents clear periodic and phased - locked variations with an amplitude of 0.2% over @xmath93 orbits , and has not shown any atypical observations , pointing to long - term stability .",
    "this might be due to the period of 144.7 days , which keeps the stars and their cs disks apart despite the relatively high eccentricity ( 0.26 ) .",
    "ntts  160905 - 1859 presents periodic but not phased - locked variations .",
    "no periodic variation is seen when viewing all the data , but more regular variations are seen when taking shorter time intervals that include only a few orbits at a time .",
    "this points to rapid re - arrangement of the cs material , on a time scale of 1 orbit , and might also explain 2 atypical observations .",
    "ntts  162814 - 2427 presents very variable and noisy polarization with an amplitude of 0.6% . whereas the variations as usually seen in polarization , ntts  162814 - 2427 s variations are clear in position angle , although with a low amplitude of less than 3 . moreover , the variations in position angle are mostly single - periodic ( seen once per orbit ) , which might be the result of the high eccentricity 0.48 , as predicted by our numerical simulations ( papers  i and ii ) .",
    "ntts  162819 - 2423s presents high amplitude ( 1% ) polarimetric variations , but those are very noisy .",
    "this might be due to the quadruple nature of this system , and the accidental inclusion of more than the south binary in some of the measurements .",
    "the amplitude of the periodic polarimetric variations is greater in the sco and oph sample ( @xmath94% ) than in the tau , aur , ori one ( @xmath95% ) .",
    "additional polarimetric observations obtained over a shorter period of time would be interesting to see if the noise is reduced and the variations hence made clearer , and if the variations are still periodic .",
    "one of the goals of these observations was to find the orbital inclinations .",
    "unfortunately , non - periodic or pseudo - periodic variations sometimes mask the truly periodic variations by introducing noise .",
    "this noise is too high for the bme formalism to find reasonable estimates of the orbital inclination , in the 22 binaries studied so far .",
    "three factors contribute to this difficulty .",
    "first , dust grains are the main scatterers in these systems , and it has been shown that dust grains produce polarimetric variations of smaller amplitude than electrons ( paper  ii ) .",
    "second , the disk around these short - period binaries are probably cb rather than cs ones , and cb disks produce variations of smaller amplitudes than cs disks ( paper  ii ) .",
    "finally , non - periodic events introduce noise that mask the already small amplitude variations .",
    "this last problem might be improved by taking data on shorter periods of time .",
    "the bme formalism also returns moments of the distribution of the scatterers , used to measure the asymmetry with respect to the orbital plane and the degree of concentration towards the orbital plane .",
    "although the assumptions used in the bme formalism ( scattering on electrons , circular orbits ) are not met in the pms binaries studied here , the values returned for pms binaries are of the same order of magnitude as values for other types of stars and as for our simulations ( @xmath1110@xmath96 ) .",
    "there are no clear correlations between the polarimetric variations and the orbital characteristics .",
    "the most variable binaries all have high orbital eccentricities , @xmath87 .",
    "the 2 stars with high eccentricity but low amplitude variations , haro  1 - 14c and ntts  045251 + 3016 , also have long periods , which might explain why more variability is not seen .",

    "<S> we present polarimetric observations of 7 pre - main - sequence ( pms ) spectroscopic binaries located in the @xmath0 ophiuchus and upper scorpius star forming regions ( sfrs ) . </S>",

    "<S> after estimates of the interstellar polarization are removed , all binaries have an _ intrinsic _ polarization above 0.4% , even though most of them do not present other evidences for circumstellar dust . </S>",
    "<S> two binaries , ntts  162814 - 2427 and ntts  162819 - 2423s , present high levels of intrinsic polarization between 1.5% and 2.1% , in agreement with the fact that other observations ( photometry , spectroscopy ) indicate the presence of circumstellar dust . </S>",
    "<S> tests reveal that all 7 pms binaries have a statistically variable or possibly variable polarization . combining these results with our previous sample of binaries located in the taurus , auriga and orion sfrs </S>",
    "<S> , 68% of the binaries have an intrinsic polarization above 0.5% , and 90% of the binaries are polarimetrically variable or possibly variable . </S>",
    "<S> ntts  160814 - 1857 , ntts  162814 - 2427 , and ntts  162819 - 2423s are clearly polarimetrically variable . </S>",
    "<S> the first two also exhibit phase - locked variations over @xmath110 and @xmath140 orbits respectively . </S>",
    "<S> statistically , ntts  160905 - 1859 is possibly variable , but it shows periodic variations not detected by the statistical tests ; those variations are not phased - locked and only present for short intervals of time . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes of the variations reach a few tenths of a percent , greater than for the previously studied pms binaries located in the taurus , orion , and auriga sfrs . </S>",
    "<S> the high - eccentricity system ntts  162814 - 2427 shows single - periodic variations , in agreement with our previous numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the observations with some of our numerical simulations , and also show that an analysis of the periodic polarimetric variations with the brown , mclean , & emslie ( 1978 ) formalism to find the orbital inclination is for the moment premature : non - periodic events introduce stochastic noise that partially masks the periodic variations and prevents the bme formalism from finding a reasonable estimate of the inclination . </S>"
