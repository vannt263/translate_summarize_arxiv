    "the lower bound @xmath394for the radius of convergence of the power series @xmath13 is 0.094 .",
    "therefore we do not know whether @xmath27 converges with @xmath395@xmath292however @xmath396is an extremely conservative bound calculated only with @xmath397and @xmath398 ; @xmath396thus represents a worst - case scenario on the coefficients @xmath399 . for these reasons",
    "the condition @xmath400 of is probably of limited practical use .",
    "its usefulness lies in the qualitative remarks 3 and 4 above , which state that the function @xmath27 does provide the roots for @xmath255small enough or @xmath29large enough .        from figure 5.1b",
    "the radius of convergence @xmath401 assessed numerically as the limit of @xmath402 appears to be about 1.05 .",
    "therefore the power series @xmath27 does converge with @xmath403 ( a few missing values in the @xmath404sequence arise when @xmath405 , i.e. @xmath406 )    the real and imaginary parts of @xmath407are plotted in figure 5.1a over two periods of length @xmath408 ( 200 terms are used to calculate the series ) .",
    "these two parts taken at @xmath409and @xmath410 coincide with those obtained using matlab s built - in polynomial equation routine to solve eq . with @xmath409(stars and circles in figure 5.1a ) .    with real coefficients for the polynomial equation the complex roots come in conjugate pairs .",
    "there are two such pairs .",
    "one for @xmath411 and the other for @xmath412 .",
    "in addition there are two real roots at @xmath413and at @xmath414 in this and some other cases these real roots appear to be at local minima or maxima of the @xmath415function .",
    "these special behaviors of and relationships between the real and imaginary parts no doubt arise from particular patterns in the sequence @xmath416 which have yet to be explored .",
    "these structures disappear with complex coefficients since in this case there are no more complex conjugate roots .",
    "there are not enough terms to calculate the roots when @xmath403 with @xmath419 however , the values provided by are very close to those calculated numerically ( table [ table.4938efc6-b082 - 4572 - 9fb7-e5725be5726f ] ) .          if the constant term @xmath420 in eq . is less than approximately 4 , the radius of convergence for the series @xmath13drops below 1 .",
    "the method can no longer be used to solve eq . with @xmath421 .",
    "several approaches have been tried in order to extend the method to the case @xmath79 small in which at least one root becomes close to 0 .",
    "one possibility would be to transform the unknown in such a way that small roots are moved away from 0 .",
    "for example one could write the polynomial equation in terms of a changed unknown @xmath422 : if a root @xmath229 is small then the corresponding @xmath423is large .",
    "however this approach did not change the problem .",
    "another more promising possibility would be to inject the parameter @xmath7 differently into the equation .",
    "for example one could use a similar approach after multiplying the left side of eq .",
    "by @xmath68instead of the right side . or one could multiply each term of the equation by a power @xmath64with a different and well - chosen @xmath209 for each term . to date such attempts have proved largely inconclusive .",
    "ours is only a first step , which shows that the roots of a particular class of polynomial equations can be expressed explicitly with an infinite number of rational operations and root extractions .",
    "it is to be hoped that some variant of the family of periodic functions @xmath13 will eventually emerge to provide closed - form expressions for the roots of arbitrary polynomial equations .",
