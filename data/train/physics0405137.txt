    "high intensity ultrashort - pulse lasers allow experimental studies of multi - electron effects , such as a non - sequential double ionization , high order harmonic generation or above threshold ionization @xcite .",
    "while the single ionization of atoms or molecules , as well as the high order harmonic generation can be described within a single active electron model , such an approximation in the case of double ionization and laser intensity below the saturation value gives ionization rates that are much smaller than experimentally observed , indicating that interactions between electrons are important @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the double ionization of molecules within a classical model for electrons in a combined coulomb and external field applying the approach developed in  @xcite for the multiple ionization of atoms .",
    "multi - photon double ionization of atoms in strong laser fields can be regarded as a three step process @xcite . in the first step one electron tunnels out through the stark saddle and then",
    "is returned back to the nucleus @xcite .",
    "thereafter , in the second step a highly excited state of an atom or a molecule is formed at the expense of the energy brought back by the returning electron ( up to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a ponderomotive energy ) .",
    "finally , in the third step such a highly excited compound state decays in several ways through a single , double or multiple ionization . the starting point in our classical analysis of the double ionization of molecules",
    "is the excited complex , i.e. we assume that we have an initial state of two highly excited electrons close to the molecular core .",
    "we shall focus on double ionization events that can then appear as a possible channels of decay . among those events there are : a sequential process ( when the highly excited compound state decays emitting electrons one by one ) and a non - sequential event ( two electron leave the excited molecule simultaneously ) .",
    "there have been experimental research aimed on double ionization of diatomic molecules  @xcite which showed that there are differences between molecular species .",
    "for example , nitrogen molecule , @xmath2 , clearly exhibits a ",
    "knee - structure  in a double - to - single ionization yields ratio , like atoms do , while for oxygen molecule , @xmath3 , such a structure is rather not visible @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the case of @xmath2 it seems , that electrons escape with similar momenta along field polarization axis more often than in the case of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we consider this problem from the point of view of the classical analysis , which starts after the formation of the highly excited compound state , and discuss possible reasons for such different experimental observations .",
    "paper is structured as follows in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce a theoretical model on which we based our analysis .",
    "[ local ] consists of the identification and description of the saddles in the potential . then in sec .",
    "[ sym ] we present results of the numerical simulations . and finally , in sec .  [ summary ]",
    "we conclude .",
    "as we mentioned above , in our starting situation ( as a result of the former re - scattering ) there are two highly excited electrons close to the molecular core in the presence of linearly polarized laser field .",
    "the motion of the molecular core is frozen due to the fact that for short laser pulses molecules have not enough time to change their orientation @xcite .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian reads ( in atomic units ) : @xmath4 where the potential , @xmath5 consists of the potential energies associated with interactions of the electrons with the nuclei ( the entire structure of the molecular core is approximated by two positively charge nuclei ) , @xmath6 for ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 indicate position of the nuclei and the electrons , respectively , the repulsion between electrons , @xmath10 and the term describing interaction with the field ( polarized along the @xmath11 axis ) , @xmath12 the electric field strength @xmath13 has an oscillatory component times the envelope from the pulse , namely : @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 the peak amplitude , frequency , and initial phase of the filed , respectively , and with @xmath18 the pulse envelope of duration @xmath19 where @xmath20 is number of cycles in the pulse .    for a sake of convenience",
    ", we shall place the origin of our coordinate system in the center of mass of the nuclei , then two parameters appear , namely : @xmath21 , distance between nuclei , and @xmath22 , angle between molecular axis and @xmath11 axis ( polarization axis ) . without loss of generality we assumed that the molecule lies in @xmath23 plane , hence potential energies for each electron is : @xmath24    as one can see , in our model the only difference between different diatomic species lies in the distance , @xmath21 , between the nuclei .",
    "what we consider in this paper is the evolution of electrons in combined coulomb and external fields after a re - scattering event when the highly excited compound state is formed . for one electron in the coulomb potential ,",
    "if the external field is non - zero the stark saddle is opened .",
    "then the electron can get away through this saddle and ionize . in our case",
    "we have two electrons and if there were no interaction between the electrons they could escape simultaneously through the same saddle on top of each other .",
    "but once there is repulsion between electrons , the stark saddle splits into two saddles that lie on the opposite sides of the field polarization axis . in the case of atoms ,",
    "those two saddles lie symmetrically with respect to the polarization axis .",
    "then the motion of the electrons can be confined in some symmetry subspace  @xcite . for diatomic molecules ( such as @xmath2 or @xmath3 )",
    "that does not generally occur since they possess their own symmetry axis which can be oriented at any angle to the polarization axis destroying the global symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , saddles are formed by the external field and following arguments presented in  @xcite we assume that electrons to leave the molecule in a correlated manner have to pass simultaneously close to them .    before the double ionization escape",
    "both electrons pass close to the nuclei where they interact strongly with each other and with the nuclei . for that reason",
    "we assume that all memory of the previous motion is lost .",
    "then it is correct to assume that the compound state which decays to a doubly charged molecule may be classically simulated by a statistical distribution for two electrons close to the nuclei .",
    "furthermore , the classical motion of the electrons is fast compared to the field oscillations and an adiabatic approximation , keeping the field fixed , becomes useful in the analysis of the ionization channels . using this adiabatic assumption we will identify and describe saddle points , through which the electrons can escape .    for a molecule oriented along the field axis",
    "the problem possesses axial symmetry . then switching to the cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath25 for @xmath26th electron )",
    "one can easily define a symmetry subspace of electron motion . restricting the electrons to a plane ( i.e. @xmath27 ) their coordinates in the @xmath28 symmetry subspace are @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the potential",
    "energy reduces to @xmath31 with a molecule oriented perpendicularly with respect to the field there are two @xmath28 symmetry subspaces .",
