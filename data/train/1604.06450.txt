    "these results for the s-0 sample are consistent with previous measurements using a contactless rf technique.@xcite this suggests the absence of resistive heating in our measurements .    for the sample s-99 [ fig .",
    "[ fig_2](b ) ] , @xmath10 for both field directions show a similar behavior as for s-0 but the absolute values are much smaller than for the pure crystal .",
    "moreover , @xmath48 also shifts to lower temperature . for sample s-104 [ fig .",
    "[ fig_2](c ) ] , @xmath26 and @xmath27 exhibit similar saturation trends at low temperatures with different slopes at @xmath22 close to @xmath48 .",
    "when compared to the previous results measured in low fields for sample s-104 , @xmath27 can be well described using the simplified whh formula , but @xmath26 is remarkably smaller than the value predicted.@xcite this implies that the temperature dependence of @xmath10 is influenced by factors outside the simplified whh model .",
    "similarly , the nearly linear temperature dependence of @xmath27 for s-0 and s-99 can not be explained by this model .     determined from 90% @xmath46 ( symbols ) and fits using the whh theory ( solid lines ) for the samples ( a ) s-0 , ( b ) s-99 , and ( b ) s-104 at @xmath6 and @xmath7 . ]    as previous studies have shown , spin paramagnetism has a significant influence on the upper critical field of fese-11 and feas-122-type superconductors.@xcite we note that the pauli paramagnetic limiting fields in simplest approximation , @xmath49,@xcite are about 58.0(2 ) t , 50.4(2 ) t , and 33.8(4 ) t for s-0 , s-99 , and s-104 , respectively .",
    "these values are comparable to the zero - temperature @xmath26 for these samples .",
    "this implies that the spin - paramagnetic effect needs to be considered when analyzing the temperature dependence of @xmath10 , especially for @xmath6 . through the maki parameter , @xmath50 , and",
    "@xmath51@xcite the effects of pauli spin paramagnetism and spin - orbit scattering have been included in the whh theory for a single - band @xmath52-wave weakly coupled type - ii superconductor in the dirty limit.@xcite @xmath10 is given by    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the digamma function , @xmath55^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath56    when @xmath57 , spin paramagnetism becomes essential.@xcite in fig .",

    "when @xmath51 is fixed to 0 , @xmath26 for sample s-0 can be well described with @xmath58 3.3(3 ) indicating strong spin paramagnetism .",
    "it should be noted that the fit is not unique and the temperature dependence of @xmath26 can as well be described with other fit values of @xmath50 when @xmath51 is non - zero .",
    "this is due to the limited temperature region where data for @xmath26 are available . for different combinations of @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    ", @xmath26 varies largely at low temperatures and high fields , below our measurement range .",
    "moreover , in order to describe @xmath10 at low fields well , @xmath50 has to increase when @xmath51 becomes larger because spin - orbit scattering tends to reduce the effect of spin paramagnetism.@xcite accordingly , @xmath58 3.3(3 ) is a lower limit .",
    "on the other hand , the whh model with @xmath58 0 and @xmath59 0 does not describe the curve well .",
    "thus , even though @xmath50 and @xmath51 are not uniquely determined by our data , the large @xmath58 3.3(3 ) strongly indicates that spin paramagnetism plays an important role in suppressing superconductivity for @xmath6",

    "@xmath27 at low temperatures is enhanced when compared to the whh model .",
    "such an enhancement can not be explained by @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , it suggests that multiband effect become important when the magnetic field is oriented along the @xmath62 direction .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed in tl@xmath23rb@xmath24fe@xmath25se@xmath11.@xcite    increasing the s content to 0.99 , @xmath26 is suppressed to below 50 t in the whole temperature range [ fig .",
    "[ fig_3](b ) ] . without considering spin - orbital scattering ,",

    "s-0 will be larger than in sample s-99 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath27 shows a linear temperature dependence down to about 8 k , below which an upturn appears . as for the pure sample ,",
    "this upturn can not be described by use of the simplified whh model .",
    "this shows that multiband effects are still important in sample s-99 for @xmath7 .    for the single - band clean limit",
    ", the maki parameters for @xmath6 and @xmath7 should be related by the ratio of the fermi velocity @xmath64 in the @xmath65 plane to @xmath66 along @xmath62 .",
    "the cylinder - like fermi surface in iron - based superconductors results in @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , this ratio is larger than 1 and the @xmath50 for @xmath6 is expected to be larger than for @xmath7,@xcite i.e. , spin paramagnetism is stronger for @xmath6 than for @xmath7 .",
    "the open electronic orbits along @xmath62 reduce the orbital - limited upper critical field considerably.@xcite    with further s substitution [ sample s-104 , fig .",
    "[ fig_3](c ) ] , the whh model without spin - orbit scattering can describe the temperature dependence of @xmath26 well with @xmath68 .",
    "this is somewhat larger than 1 , suggesting that spin paramagnetism is still essential .",
    "but , the absolute value is much smaller than for the samples s-0 and s-99 .",
    "obviously , @xmath50 decreases with increasing s content , i.e. , spin paramagnetism becomes less important .",

    "]    the anisotropy of the upper critical field , @xmath21 , supplies further information on the effect of s substitution on the evolution of @xmath10 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] , @xmath70 exhibits a similar trend in the temperature - dependence for all three samples : the anisotropy decreases considerably with temperature . for sample",
    "s-0 , @xmath70 is @xmath47 3.1 at 28 k and decreases to @xmath47 1.8 at 18 k , a somewhat smaller value than reported in literature.@xcite for sample s-99 , @xmath70 is about 6.3 at 25 k and decreases gradually to @xmath47 2.2 at 1.5 k. finally , for sample s-104 , @xmath70 lies between @xmath47 5.2 at 15 k and @xmath47 3.5 at 1.5 k. this trend has been observed in all iron - based superconductors.@xcite    the origin of the small anisotropy of the upper critical fields could be caused by a three - dimensional electronic structure , spin paramagnetism , or multiband effects.@xcite",
    "the notable outcome of our study is that the anisotropy increases with s content , consistent with previous results measured in the ginzburg - landau region where it was speculated that this might be due to a smaller warping of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) fermi surface ( fs ) with increasing s content.@xcite the increase of the anisotropy with s substitution is understandable since orbital pair breaking is more effective near @xmath48,@xcite and a more 2d fs should lead to a larger @xmath70 .",
    "however , this work shows that other factors can as well result in an enhanced anisotropy of @xmath10 in the high - field low - temperature region .",
    "first , spin paramagnetism which usually decreases the anisotropy of the upper critical field at high fields becomes weaker with increasing s content , thus the suppression of @xmath26 is reduced .",
    "second , multiband effects also become weaker at higher s content , and the slight upturn of @xmath27 at high fields changes to a saturation behavior described by the whh model .",
    "these two opposite trends contribute to a larger @xmath70 .",
    "since @xmath50 is proportional to the effective mass in the clean limit,@xcite the smaller @xmath50 with increasing s content can partially be related to a decrease of the effective mass.@xcite the decrease in @xmath50 is in agreement with suppression of spin susceptibility and spin excitations in k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath71s@xmath4.@xcite in addition , sulfur substitution might also change the electronic structure leading to reduced multiband effects .",
