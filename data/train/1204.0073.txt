    "one of the characteristic features of barred galaxies is the existence of gaseous substructures such as a pair of dust lanes , a nuclear ring , and nuclear spirals , visible in optical images and radio maps ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "dust lanes located at the leading side of the bar are interpreted as shocks in the gas flows , as evidenced by the enhanced radio emissions and sharp velocity jumps across them ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the curvature of dust lanes depends on the bar strength and aspect ratio , while largely independent of its pattern speed and galaxy mass @xcite .",
    "nuclear rings are the regions of high gas density and usually populated with numerous regions , indicative of recent starburst activities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they have a size typically of @xmath1 , but appear to be larger and wider in galaxies with less compact mass distribution @xcite .",
    "nuclear spirals located inside the rings are believed to be a channel for gas inflows to the galaxy center , potentially powering active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the gas flows shaping bar substructures are intrinsically nonlinear , numerical simulations have been a powerful tool to study their formation , evolution , and associated dynamics ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", @xcite showed that a non - axisymmetric bar potential induces dust - lane shocks at downstream from the bar major axis and that the shocks become more straight under a stronger bar .",
    "dust lanes tend to become shorter and located closer to the bar major axis when the gas sound speed is larger @xcite . the shocked gas at dust lanes loses angular momentum and flows inward to form a nuclear ring at the position where the external gravity is balanced by the centrifugal forces @xcite . using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics method",
    ", @xcite and @xcite showed that the formation of strong nuclear spirals supported by shocks requires a large sound speed and the presence of a central black hole ( bh ) , although their models were unable to resolve weak spirals in the nuclear regions due to a small number of particles ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "very recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) ran high - resolution simulations using the grid - based cmhog code on a cylindrical geometry .",
    "paper i found that the original cmhog code used by @xcite contained errors in the evaluation of the bar forces , compromising their numerical results as well as others ( e.g. , @xcite ) who unknowingly adopted the original code with the errors . using a corrected version of the code , paper i found that when the gas sound speed @xmath2 is small , nuclear rings are narrow and decoupled from nuclear spirals , making the mass inflow rates @xmath3 toward the galaxy center extremely small ( @xmath4 ) . on the other hand , strong thermal perturbations in models with high @xmath2",
    "make the rings broad , leading to @xmath5 .",
    "paper i also found that the shape and strength of nuclear spirals depend sensitively on the gas sound speed and the bh mass @xmath6 such that they are leading if both @xmath2 and @xmath6 are small , weak trailing if @xmath2 is small and @xmath6 is large , and strong trailing if both @xmath2 and @xmath6 are large : nuclear spirals are readily destroyed by the ring material on eccentric orbits when @xmath2 is large and @xmath6 is small .",
    "while aforementioned work improved our understanding on gas dynamics associated with bar substructures , they are without one of the most important ingredients of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , namely magnetic fields that are pervasive in disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . by observing barred galaxies in radio polarized emissions",
    ", @xcite found that magnetic fields are strong in dust lanes and nuclear rings , suggesting that they are dynamically important in shaping bar substructures ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "some barred galaxies such as ngc 1365 , ngc 1097 , ngc 1365 are observed to possess `` magnetic arms '' characterized by stronger fields and lower density than surrounding regions @xcite .",
    "in addition , magnetic fields exert torque that is much larger than gravitational torque , providing an efficient means to transport gas from a nuclear ring inward to feed an agn @xcite .",
    "therefore , the effect of magnetic fields on structure and evolution of barred galaxies should not be ignored .",
    "there have been a number of numerical studies on magnetic field distributions in barred galaxies .",
    "depending on how magnetic fields are treated , they can be categorized into two groups : ( 1 ) those based on mean - field dynamo theories ( e.g. , @xcite ) and ( 2 ) those using full magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations @xcite .",
    "although numerical models from the first group are successful in obtaining synthetic polarization maps and overall field morphologies comparable to observations , they rely on parameterized turbulent terms in the induction equation that are uncertain .",
    "more importantly , the mean - field dynamo models take velocity fields from hydrodynamic or @xmath7-body sticky - particle simulations and evolve magnetic fields passively , without considering the back reaction of magnetic fields to the gas .",
    "on the other hand , mhd models in the second group naturally handle gas responses to the embedded magnetic fields .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that dynamical effects of magnetic fields lead to the formation of low - density magnetic arms in the regions outside the bar , which is clearly unseen in the mean - field dynamo models ( see also @xcite ) . even without the prescription for the mean - field dynamo ,",
    "magnetic energy in these mhd models grows due to shear and compression by a factor of about 15 relative to the initial value over a 1 gyr period @xcite .    because the mhd models mentioned above focused on magnetic structures in the outer regions , however , the effects of magnetic fields on bar substructures and mass inflow rates have yet to be explored .",
    "can magnetic fields make dust lanes stronger ?",
    "do they make nuclear rings smaller or larger ?",
    "do nuclear spirals survive in the presence of magnetic fields ? how do the mass inflow rates change as the field strength varies ? in order to address these questions ,",
    "we in this paper run high - resolution mhd simulations using the athena code @xcite .",
    "this work is a straightforward extension of paper i by including magnetic fields .",
    "our models are two dimensional , assuming a razor - thin disk .",
    "this allows to better resolve the in - plane direction than in the three - dimensional models considered by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our two - dimensional models are unable to capture the dynamical consequences of parker instability and other processes that involve the vertical direction .",
    "in addition to studying the magnetic effects on substructures in the bar regions , we identify an mhd dynamo mechanism that amplifies magnetic fields , eventually leading to magnetic arms in the outer regions .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe our numerical methods and model parameters , and present numerical resistivity of the athena code . in section 3 ,",
    "we make a comparison between the results of the athena and cmhog codes on hydrodynamic models with identical parameters . in section 4",
    ", we present the results of mhd simulations on the bar regions , focusing on the effects of magnetic fields on bar substructures and mass inflow rates .",
    "in section 5 , we study evolution of gas and magnetic fields in the outer regions . in section 6 ,",
    "we conclude with a summary and discussion of our numerical results .",
    "we consider a magnetized gaseous disk and study its responses to an imposed non - axisymmetric bar potential .",
    "gas dynamics without the effect of magnetic fields was presented in paper i. as in paper i , the disk is initially uniform , isothermal , vertically - thin , and non - self - gravitating .",
    "the bar is assumed to rotate rigidly about the galaxy center with a fixed pattern speed @xmath8 .",
    "we solve the dynamical equations in the frame corotating with the bar in the @xmath9 plane .",
    "the equations of magnetohydrodynamics in the rotating frame integrated along the vertical direction are @xmath10    [ eq : mom ] @xmath11    @xmath12    here , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath2 denote the surface density , velocity in the rotating frame , and the sound speed in the gas , while @xmath15 represents the midplane value of the three - dimensional magnetic field times the square root of the ratio of surface density to midplane volume density ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that the induction equation ( [ eq : ind ] ) in the rotating frame has the same form as in the inertial frame ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity @xmath16 in the inertial frame is obtained from @xmath17 .",
    "we do not consider star formation and the associated gas recycling in the present work .",
    "the external gravitational potential , represented by @xmath18 in equation ( [ eq : mom ] ) , and the associated rotation curve are taken identical to those in paper i. here we describe these briefly .",
    "the external potential consists of four components : a stellar disk modeled by a kuzmin - toomre disk , a central bulge modeled by a modified hubble profile with central density @xmath19 , a non - axisymmetric bar modeled by a @xcite spheroid with central density @xmath20 , and a central supermassive bh with mass @xmath6 . without a bh , the rotation velocity @xmath21 rises steeply with the galactocentric radius @xmath22 and attains a more - or - less constant value of @xmath23 at @xmath24 .",
    "the presence of a bh affects @xmath21 near the central parts , resulting in @xmath25 at @xmath26 .",
    "the bar has a patten speed of @xmath27 , which places the corotation resonance ( cr ) at @xmath28 . in order to avoid abrupt responses of the gas due to a sudden introduction of the bar , we increase @xmath20 linearly with time over one bar revolution time of @xmath29 myr , while keeping the net density @xmath30 fixed .",
    "this ensures that shape of @xmath31 averaged along the azimuthal direction is not changed much with time .",
    "our model disks initially have uniform surface density @xmath32 and isothermal sound speed of @xmath33 .",
    "magnetic fields are initially in plane , uniform , and purely azimuthal .",
    "the field strength is parameterized by the dimensionless plasma parameter @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the midplane values of volume density and three - dimensional magnetic field strength . in terms of dimensional units @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the scale height of the gaseous disk .",
    "note that the initial disk with constant @xmath39 has a mass - to - flux ratio @xmath40 that is increasing linearly with @xmath41 .    in order to focus on the effects of magnetic field strength and rotation curve at the central parts , we consider eight models with differing @xmath6 and @xmath39 , as listed in table [ tbl : model ] .",
    "the strength of magnetic fields is chosen to vary from sub - equipartition ( @xmath42 ) to equipartition ( @xmath43 ) values with thermal energy .",
    "we also consider hydrodynamic models with @xmath44 to make comparisons with the results of paper i. models with a prefix bh7 possess a central bh with @xmath45 , with the @xmath46 curve attaining the local maximum and minimum at @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ( see paper i ) .",
    "the bh7 models have only a single inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) at @xmath49 where @xmath50 . on the other hand , bh0 models with no",
    "bh have two ilrs at @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and the @xmath46 curve peaks at @xmath47 .",
    "we take model bh7mhd01 with @xmath53 and @xmath43 as our standard model .",

    "athena utilizes a higher order godunov scheme which conserves mass , momentum , and magnetic flux within machine precisions .",
    "it also provides several different schemes for integration in time , spatial reconstruction , and solution of the riemann problem .",
    "we take the van leer algorithm with piecewise linear reconstruction and first order flux correction . for a riemann solver",
    ", we use the exact nonlinear solver for hydrodynamic models and an approximate hlld - type nonlinear solver for mhd runs .",
    "our simulation domain is a square box with side @xmath56 in each direction .",
    "we set up a uniform cartesian grid with @xmath57 zones over @xmath58 .",
    "the corresponding grid spacing is @xmath59 , about an order magnitude smaller than models in @xcite .",
    "these high - resolution runs are necessary to explore properties of bar substructures in detail .",
    "we apply the outflow boundary conditions at the domain boundaries ( i.e. , at @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) . to measure the mass inflow rates toward the galaxy center , we place a central hole with radius of 20 pc and",
    "define a density floor @xmath62 inside the hole . at each time",
    ", we calculate the gas mass @xmath63 flown into the hole by integrating the excess interior density as @xmath64 , and then reset the interior density to @xmath62 .",
    "the mass inflow rate is then obtained from @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the computational timestep . in this paper , we present the results with @xmath67 , but we checked that @xmath3 is insensitive to the choice of @xmath62 as long as it is taken sufficiently small .",
    "the inflowing gas may carry magnetic fields to the galaxy center , as well . in order to allow for @xmath68-field accretion , we let the magnetic fields vanish inside the central hole while preserving the divergence - free condition .",
    "this is achieved by calculating the vector potential at each time , cutting it off to a constant value inside the hole , and then recalculating the @xmath15 vector from the modified vector potential .",
    "we note that taking @xmath69 arbitrarily inside the hole sometimes makes @xmath68-fields bend abruptly near the hole boundary .",
    "in addition , density in the vicinity of the hole frequently becomes very small , greatly limiting the computational timestep by increasing the alfvn speed . in order to minimize these spurious effects",
    ", we utilize the non - ideal ohmic dissipation term included in athena by taking magnetic resistivity @xmath70 in the circular region at @xmath71 , while the rest of the simulation domain is kept non - resistive .",
    "this results in a gradual dissipation of @xmath68-fields in the region surrounding the hole , allowing us to run simulations for a long period of time .    finally",
    ", we remark on the numerical resistivity of the athena code that we use .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the magnetic diffusivity of the real ism accurately since it is very clumpy and diffusivity changes a lot between the different phases with different temperature and different degree of ionization .",
    "if turbulence dominates the diffusion and dissipation of the magnetic fields , it is perhaps of the order of @xmath72 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the associated magnetic reynolds number is @xmath73 , much larger than unity , so that taking the @xmath74 limit , as we do in the present work except for the small central regions , is a useful starting point .",
    "nevertheless , we note that there is non - zero ( but small ) numerical diffusivity over the entire simulation domain introduced by the numerical scheme . in appendix",
    ", we use linear - amplitude magnetosonic waves to evaluate the coefficients of numerical viscosity as well as magnetic diffusivity of the athena code . for @xmath75 and the wavelength @xmath76 typical for the tearing - modes of magnetic reconnection occurring in the outer regions ( see section [ sec : outer ] ) , the numerical resistivity is estimated to be @xmath77 , about three orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath78 .",
    "the associated magnetic diffusion time is @xmath79 , indicating that the non - ideal effect of numerical resistivity on the @xmath68-field evolution can be important if the field strength changes considerably over the grid scale .",
    "as mentioned above , paper i explored hydrodynamical models of barred galaxies using the corrected version of the cylindrical cmhog code that originally contained a bug in calculating the bar forces @xcite . on the other hand , the present calculations make use of the athena code on a uniform cartesian grid .",
    "since the current models include two hydrodynamic models with the same parameters as in paper i , it is interesting to compare the results from two different codes .",
    "this will check not only the reliability of the athena runs but also the validity of the corrected bar forces in paper i. note that by employing a non - uniform grid , the cmhog models in paper i has a higher ( lower ) spatial resolution at @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) than the current athena runs with a uniform grid spacing .",
    "overall evolution of hydrodynamic models is described in paper i : here we summarize the main features .",
    "as the bar potential is slowly introduced , initially - circular gas orbits are perturbed , forming a pair of overdense ridges at the downstream side of the bar major axis .",
    "as the bar potential grows further , the overdense ridges eventually develop into shocks , appearing as dark dust lanes in optical images of barred galaxies .",
    "gas loses a significant amount of angular momentum at the shocks and thus moves radially in , forming a nuclear ring at the position where the centrifugal force balances the external gravity .",
    "in addition , these shocks are curved and thus able to generate vorticity .",
    "vorticity grows secularly with time by the successive passages across shocks .",
    "when it achieves substantial amplitudes , it causes the shock fronts to wiggle , producing small clumps with high vorticity .",
    "the whole process of clump formation is analogous to the wiggle instability of spiral shocks identified by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these clumps are added to the nuclear ring .",
    "as clumps collide with each other , the ring becomes homogeneous gradually .",
    "figure [ fig : compsnap ] compares the snapshots of model bh0hd in the present work with those of model cs05bh0 from paper i at @xmath82 myr when the bar substructures reach a quasi - steady state .",
    "the bar is oriented vertically along the @xmath83-axis , and the gas inside ( outside ) the cr at @xmath84 is rotating in the counterclockwise ( clockwise ) direction .",
    "the images in the upper panels cover the whole region inside the corotation , while the lower panels enlarge the central @xmath1 regions . in the upper panels ,",
    "dotted curves draw the outermost @xmath0-orbit that cuts the @xmath85- and @xmath83-axes at @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , and has a jacobi energy of @xmath88 under our adopted external potential ( e.g. , @xcite ) . inside this orbit , there are families of closed @xmath0- and @xmath89-orbits that cross each other , resulting in shocks at the leading side of the bar major axis .",
    "as gas loses angular momentum at the shocks and moves toward the central parts , the bar regions becomes gradually evacuated . outside the outermost @xmath0-orbit ,",
    "no closed orbit exists : gas there simply moves on slightly perturbed , near - circular orbits , without inducing shocks .",
    "the gas moving in slowly due to the bar torque from outside is subsequently trapped in the outermost @xmath0-orbit , and stays in it .",
    "therefore , the outermost @xmath0-orbit acts as a barrier that inflowing gas can not penetrate .",
    "other than weak trailing spirals produced by the bar toque that emerge from the downstream side of the bar ends , the outer regions are almost featureless in hydrodynamic models .    in the lower panels ,",
    "solid curves draw an @xmath89-orbit with @xmath90 that approximately follows the nuclear ring .",
    "the morphological agreement between the cmhog and athena results is fairly good , although the ring in the cmhog run is more clumpy and slightly larger .",
    "this is because the athena run has a higher resolution at @xmath81 where dust lanes form .",
    "this makes the dust - lane shocks in the athena runs better resolved , leading to higher angular momentum loss and a smaller ring than in the cmhog counterpart .",
    "in addition , the wiggle instability of the dust lanes is more vigorous in the athena run since it grows faster at smaller scales .",
    "hence , the athena run produces more clumps that collide frequently , resulting in a smoother ring than in the cmhog run .",
    "since the athena run has a lower resolution at @xmath80 , on the other hand , it harbors weaker nuclear spirals than in the cmhog run , as figure [ fig : compsnap ] shows .",
    "the peak density relative to the mean and the pitch angle of the spirals at @xmath91 are @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the athena run , which can be compared with @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the cmhog run .",
    "figure [ fig : compprof ] provides more quantitative comparisons between the athena and cmhog results .",
    "figure [ fig : compprof]a , b plot the distributions of surface density and velocities along the slit indicated in figure [ fig : compsnap ] .",
    "the slit starts from @xmath96 and ends at @xmath97 .",
    "the dust - lane shocks in athena are slightly weaker and located @xmath98 closer to the bar major axis than in cmhog .",
    "this is consistent with a smaller nuclear ring in the athena run , since the inner ends of the dust lanes are connected to the nuclear ring .",
    "the overall velocity profiles as well as the amount of the velocity jumps from the athena and cmhog runs agree well with each other .",
    "figure [ fig : compprof]c compares the radial profiles of the mean density averaged both azimuthally and temporally over @xmath99 myr .",
    "although the density - weighted ring radius is slightly smaller in the athena run , the difference is only @xmath100 , again demonstrating good agreement between the cmhog and athena results .",
    "the black arrow marked by @xmath101 indicates the maximum radial extent of the outermost @xmath0-orbit , outside of which density is relatively unperturbed .",
    "a small spike of the mean density around @xmath102 is caused by the trapping of inflowing gas from outside .    finally , figure [ fig : compprof]d compares the mass inflow rates for bh0 and bh7 models as functions of time .",
    "because of difference in the way handling fluid variables inside the central hole , the temporal behavior of @xmath3 at early time is quite different between the athena and cmhog results , although it rapidly converges to a more - or - less constant value . in the cmhog runs , the bh0 model has larger @xmath3 at @xmath103 myr than in the bh7 model , while the former has slightly smaller @xmath3 in the athena runs",
    ". nevertheless , @xmath3 at @xmath104 myr from the athena and cmhog runs agrees with each other , on average , within a factor of 2 , implying that the current method of measuring @xmath3 by placing a central hole is reliable .    to conclude this section , despite the cmhog and athena codes are quite different in terms of",
    "coordinate geometry as well as ways of updating fluid variables , the results from both codes are in good agreement .",
    "this confirms not only that the revised force transformation in cmhog used in paper i is correct , but also that dynamics of a rotating disk can be reliably handled by the cartesian athena code that we use .",
    "we now turn to the effects of magnetic fields on bar substructures and mass inflow rates .",
    "evolution of the gas outside the outermost @xmath0-orbit is quite distinct from that inside . in this section",
    "we focus on the bar regions ( i.e. , inside the outermost @xmath0-orbit ) : the changes of magnetic structures in the outer regions will be presented in section [ sec : outer ] .",
    "early evolution in the bar regions of our standard model bh7mhd01 ( with @xmath43 and @xmath105 ) is not much different from the hydrodynamic counterpart in that the bar potential induces crowding of gas orbits to create overdense ridges that develop into dust - lane shocks .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields ( 1 ) reduces the shock density and ( 2 ) provides maxwell stress for the gas at the shocks , further removing angular momentum from it . to illustrate this , figure",
    "[ fig : snap_t150 ] plots a surface density snapshot together with the magnetic field configuration of model bh7mhd01 at @xmath106 myr .",
    "note the magnetic field lines are _ approximate _ proxy to instantaneous gas streamlines .",
    "figure [ fig : shock ] plots the variations of gas surface density , velocities , and magnetic fields along the slit at @xmath107 shown in figure [ fig : snap_t150 ] . each circle corresponds to an individual grid point . at this time , the shocks are almost parallel to the @xmath83-axis , and are moving toward the bar major axis at velocity @xmath108 relative to the bar .",
    "the perpendicular mach number of the flows along the slit relative to the shock is @xmath109 . here and hereafter , the subscripts @xmath110 and @xmath111 denote the preshock and postshock value , respectively . with @xmath112 ,",
    "the usual jump condition for one - dimensional stationary mhd shocks is a positive root of the quadratic equation @xmath113 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "] yields the compression factor @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "figure [ fig : shock ] shows that @xmath116 and @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , indicating that the density compression of the dust - lane shocks is more than steady one - dimensional shocks allow .",
    "more importantly , the sign of @xmath119 is reversed across the shock .",
    "this is because the shocks are intrinsically two dimensional in the sense that the streamlines diverge before the shock and bend abruptly to align themselves parallel to the dust lanes immediate after the shock .",
    "the bending of the streamlines at the shock is caused by a strong inflow of the gas along the dust lanes from the bar ends .",
    "this postshock inflow rotates the magnetic fields at the shock , making the sign of @xmath119 reversed .",
    "magnetic tension forces from the bent @xmath68-fields are highly efficient to remove angular momentum from the gas moving across shocks , as we will show below .",
    "the gas moving on @xmath0-orbits just inside the outermost @xmath0-orbit collides with that on the 4/1-resonant family , subsequently switching to lower @xmath0-orbits ( e.g. , @xcite ; paper i ) .",
    "gas on these lower @xmath0-orbits is continually perturbed by strong total ( thermal plus magnetic ) pressure near the bar ends , and after many revolutions it eventually transits to a trajectory that crosses the dust lane shocks .",

    "the solid lines in figure [ fig : stm]b plot the change of the rotational velocity @xmath121 along the trajectories shown in figure [ fig : stm]a , while the dotted line draws the rotation curve in initial equilibrium .",
    "the gas hits the shock at point b and loses a significant amount of angular momentum there .",
    "note that in magnetized models @xmath121 experiences a dramatic drop at the shock due largely to magnetic tension forces from the bent field lines .",
    "coriolis force makes the shocked gas rotate faster gradually as it moves radially in along the dust lane . in mhd models , magnetic stress in the dust lanes continuously removes angular momentum from the inflowing gas , causing @xmath121 to increase more slowly and thus making it move further in than in the unmagnetized model .",
    "figure [ fig : stm ] shows that in models with @xmath122 , the instantaneous streamlines make an almost closed loop after hitting the dust lane at the opposite side , forming a nuclear ring in a position where the centrifugal force balances the gravity ( i.e. , where @xmath121 achieves its initial value ) . due to significant angular momentum loss at the shocks , on the other hand , the streamline in model bh7mhd01 with @xmath43 is closed only after successively hitting the dust lane at the opposite side ( point c ) and then the first one again ( point d ) , allowing the gas to move in very close to the galaxy center . with a large supply of gas near the central parts",
    ", magnetized models would have mass inflow rates greatly enhanced compared to unmagnetized models , as will be shown in section [ sec : mdot ] .",
    "is the magnetic stress really responsible for further infall of the shocked gas toward the galaxy center ? to check this , figure [ fig : stress ] plots the radial distribution of the angle - averaged , specific angular momentum @xmath123 relative to the initial value @xmath124 as well as the the ratio of the angle - averaged maxwell stress @xmath125 to the mean thermal pressure @xmath126 at @xmath127 myr for bh7 models .",
    "note that @xmath128 at @xmath129 for all models .",
    "this is primarily because gas with high angular momentum at large @xmath41 has moved inward where @xmath124 is lower . at @xmath130 . ]",
    "if the magnetic stress is important in transporting angular momentum outward , @xmath131 would change according to @xmath132 , ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the peak value of the magnetic stress in model bh7mhd01 is @xmath133 at @xmath134 . assuming a constant rate of the angular momentum loss , the net change in @xmath131 expected over an interval of @xmath135 myr is @xmath136 , which is very close to the difference in @xmath131 between models bh7mhd01 and bh7hd at @xmath134 .",
    "this demonstrates that the magnetic stress accounts for further loss of angular momentum and hence a smaller ring size in magnetized models .",
    "the density and magnetic field structures in the bar - end regions are quite complicated .",
    "figure [ fig : bend ] shows a few snapshots of density and magnetic fields in the upper bar - end regions with @xmath137 and @xmath138 of the standard model .",
    "the 4/1-spiral shock that forms via the collisions of gas on @xmath0-orbits and on the @xmath139-resonant family is indicated as the red arrow .",
    "also indicated as the white arrow is a dense ridge of gas , called `` smudge '' , created by the convergence of streamlines at the backside of the dust lanes ( @xcite ; paper i ) .",
    "compressed magnetic fields in the smudge bend abruptly at the dust - lane shock , developing a `` @xmath140''-shaped magnetic wedge that exerts exceedingly large tension force ( @xmath141 myr ) . at the same time",

    "as the arms become more magnetized , the arm gas is expelled by strong magnetic pressure , forming magnetic arms that have stronger fields but lower density than the surrounding regions .",
    "magnetic fields with opposite polarity produced by the mhd dynamo are compressed into a thin layer at the base of the magnetic arms . with non - zero numerical resistivity ,",
    "the fields start to reconnect in the layer via conventional tearing - mode instability , producing numerous magnetic islands with large density .",
    "these magnetic islands propagate along the magnetic arms to make the outer regions highly chaotic .",
    "our numerical results show that the density and magnetic fields in dust lanes remain strong only for 100 myr around the time when the bar potential achieves the full strength .",
    "the rather rapid decline of the strength of dust lanes is primarily due to the fact that the gas located outside the outermost @xmath0-orbit is trapped there and unable to move further in .",
    "as the gas inside this orbit experiences shocks and falls in toward the center , the bar regions become evacuated and the density in the dust lanes drops accordingly .",
    "observations indicate that most barred galaxies without inner rings possess a pair of prominent dust lanes ( e.g. , @xcite ) that are nearly straight in strong bars @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that barred galaxies with strong dust lanes should have a stellar bar that is dynamically young , or there should be mechanisms replenishing the gas in the bar regions .",
    "candidate mechanisms for the latter include a spiral - arm potential outside the cr that perturbs gas orbits to send it in across the outermost @xmath0-orbit and infalls of halo gas in the form of galactic fountains ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "radio polarization observations of barred spiral galaxy ngc 1097 @xcite reveal that ( 1 ) radio ridges roughly coincide with the dust lanes in the bar region ; ( 2 ) the direction of the magnetic fields changes strongly in the upstream side , making the polarized emission almost absent there ; ( 3 ) the equipartition strength @xmath241 of the regular plus anisotropic random magnetic fields is @xmath242 g in the nuclear ring ; ( 4 ) @xmath243 g in the dust lanes ; ( 5 ) the regular fields pass through the nuclear ring , with an inclination angle of @xmath244 , which appears to deviate from the streamlines of the gas flow around the ring ; and ( 6 ) the regular fields in the nuclear region have a spiral shape with large pitch angles . points ( 1)-(3 ) are entirely consistent with our numerical results .",
    "point ( 4 ) appears consistent with our results provided that the bar in ngc 1097 is dynamically young ; otherwise density and magnetic fields of the dust lanes would not be strong enough to be observed .",
    "again , rejuvenation of the dust lanes due to gas inflows by spiral arms and/or galactic fountains would be an alternative possibility .",
    "points ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) appear inconsistent with our results that show that magnetic fields follow the nuclear rings very closely with a pitch angle less than @xmath166 and nearly circular in the central parts ( see fig.[fig : allcut ] ) .",
    "these discrepancies may owe to the fact that our models are limited to a two - dimensional razor - thin geometry with purely azimuthal initial fields , and thus are unable to capture the potential effects of poloidal fields and other dynamical processes that may be important in three dimensions .",
    "in addition , star formation and associated small - scale turbulent dynamo occurring in nuclear rings of real galaxies may considerably affect the field configurations in the central regions .",
    "the concept of `` bars within bars '' was introduced by @xcite to overcome the difficulty , caused by the formation of a narrow nuclear ring , of a single large - scale bar in bringing the disk gas all the way to within @xmath245 from the galaxy center to feed an agn .",
    "near - infrared and/or co observations of nearby barred galaxies indeed show that a substantial fraction of disk galaxies exhibit double bars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with the extent of the secondary ( nuclear ) bars typically 5 to 7 times shorter than that of the primary bar . the origin of secondary bars is yet unclear .",
    "they may arise from gravitational instability of a disk containing both stars and gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or be due to crowding of stellar orbits perturbed by gravity of a nuclear ring ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or be produced by an unstable gaseous disk in the central part ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "using a dynamically - possible doubly - barred galaxy model , @xcite showed that a hydrodynamic response of the gas to a self - consistent , secondary - bar potential is much weaker than that to the primary bar and is thus unable to enhance the mass inflow rates much .",
    "our numerical results show that magnetic fields naturally produce , albeit transiently , a bar - within - bar structure that greatly enhances the mass inflow rates even without invoking the secondary stellar bar potential . in our models ,",
    "the secondary bar ( or inner dust lanes ) is almost corotating with the outer primary bar and lasts only for @xmath246 myr before turning to weak trailing spirals . since we include the effect of stars via a fixed gravitational potential , we are of course unable to consider the back reaction of stars to the gaseous gravity .",
    "our models show that mhd dynamo action due to a bar potential combined with background shear produces magnetic arms in the outer regions , consistent with the results of @xcite and @xcite who reported that magnetic arms drift into interarm regions due to a lower angular velocity than gaseous spirals . in most external disk galaxies , magnetic field directions based on polarized synchrotron radiation",
    "follow optical spiral structures fairly well , with stronger total ( regular plus turbulent ) fields inside the arms than outside ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , there are some exceptional galaxies such as ic 342 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and ngc 6946 ( e.g. , @xcite ) that are known to have strongest magnetic fields at magnetic spiral arms that lie in between optical arms",
    ". proposed mechanisms for magnetic arms include mhd density waves in two dimensions @xcite and mean - field turbulent dynamo @xcite .",
    "the mhd wave theory invokes a systematic phase - shift between fast and slow mhd modes responsible for optical and magnetic arms , respectively @xcite , although this requires rigid - body rotation over a wide range of radii .",
    "in addition , mhd waves are subject to a buoyant instability when the vertical degree of freedom is allowed @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean - field dynamo theory argues that optical arms have stronger turbulent motions hence larger turbulent magnetic diffusivity , resulting in weaker fields than interarm regions , although it relies on uncertain parameters including the dynamo number and ignores the dynamical effects of magnetic fields on the gas .",
    "can the mhd dynamo occurring in the outer regions of our numerical models account for observed magnetic arms in ic 342 and ngc 6949 ?",
    "we think this is unlikely since the connection between bar - induced magnetic arms and those observed is quite uncertain .",
    "first of all , the disk galaxies with observed well - defined magnetic arms are not strongly barred ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the spiral arms in ngc 6949 have weak , @xmath247 modes , whereas the bar potential preferentially amplifies @xmath248 arms . moreover , it is uncertain if the mhd dynamo in three dimensions occurs similarly to in two - dimensional in - plane geometry , studied in this work .",
    "nevertheless , the mhd dynamo as a mechanism for field amplification in barred galaxies is quite attractive in that it uses only natural ingredients ( bar potential and galactic shear ) without making any assumption .",
    "it may have something do with relatively weak magnetic arms observed in outer regions of barred galaxies such as ngc 1365 @xcite , ngc 1097 and ngc 1365 @xcite , although it is questionable if the gaseous arms in these galaxies are driven solely by a bar potential .",
    "while our models considered only a bar potential as a perturbing agent for simplicity , real galaxies also have spiral arms in the regions outside a bar .",
    "it would be interesting to study how the mhd dynamo due to a bar potential conspires with a spiral - arm potential to generate and shape magnetic fields in outer regions .",
    "we are grateful to w .- y .  seo for help in implementing the bar potential in the athena code .",
    "we also acknowledge helpful comments from r.  beck and a thoughtful report from the referee .",
    "this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea ( nrf ) grant funded by the korean government ( mest ) , no .",
    "2010 - 0000712 .",
    "in this appendix we evaluate numerical viscosity and magnetic diffusivity of the athena code by using the damping rates of traveling magnetosonic waves .",
    "we begin by writing the mhd equations for isothermal , viscous , and resistive plasma @xmath249 @xmath250 @xmath251 where @xmath252 and @xmath253 are the coefficient of kinematic viscosity and magnetic diffusivity , respectively .",
    "other symbols have their usual meanings .    for the purpose of measuring the numerical values of @xmath252 and @xmath253 of the athena code used in this work , we limit ourselves to magnetosonic waves propagating along the direction perpendicular to the initial magnetic fields @xmath254 through an initially static , uniform medium with density @xmath255 .",
    "we consider small - amplitude perturbations @xmath256 , @xmath257 , and @xmath258 to the density , velocity , and magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "assuming @xmath259 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 , we linearize equations ( [ eq : con2 ] )  ( [ eq : ind2 ] ) to obtain a set of the perturbed equations @xmath262 @xmath263",
    "@xmath264    we now seek for the plane - wave solutions @xmath265 with wavenumber @xmath266 and frequency @xmath267 . plugging these into equations ( [ eq : con3 ] )  ( [ eq : ind3 ] ) and eliminating @xmath268 and @xmath269 in favor of @xmath270 , we obtain the dispersion relation @xmath271\\omega - i \\eta { c_s}^2k^4 = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath272 is the alfvn speed .",
    "it is trivial to show that when @xmath273 , equation ( [ eq : disp ] ) is reduced to the relation @xmath274 for magnetosonic waves .",
    "the corresponding ( real ) eigensolutions are @xmath275 where @xmath276 is the amplitude of the perturbations in the absence of viscosity and magnetic diffusivity .    when @xmath252 and @xmath253 are non - zero but small ( i.e. , @xmath277 ) , equation ( [ eq : disp ] ) yields @xmath278 k^2/2,\\ ] ] implying that viscosity and magnetic diffusivity cause the perturbation amplitude in equation ( [ eq : eigen ] ) to decay exponentially with time as @xmath279.\\ ] ]    to evaluate @xmath252 and @xmath253 separately , we first consider pure sound waves with wavelength @xmath280 in an unmagnetized medium , and initialize in the athena code the perturbations according to equation ( [ eq : eigen ] ) at @xmath281 .",
    "we fix the initial amplitude to @xmath282 , and monitor the temporal decay of the wave amplitude .",
    "the resulting decay rates for various runs with differing @xmath283 , the number of grid points per wavelength , are plotted in figure [ fig : decay ] as open diamonds .",
    "the best fit to the numerical viscosity is found to be @xmath284 note that @xmath285 is proportional to @xmath286 , completely analogous to the behavior of the numerical conductivity of the athena code reported by @xcite .",
    "next , we set up magnetosonic waves using equation ( [ eq : eigen ] ) at @xmath281 together with @xmath282 and @xmath287 .",
    "figure [ fig : decay ] plots as filled circles the numerical damping rates of the magnetosonic waves due to both viscosity and magnetic diffusivity . after correcting for the viscous contribution using equation ( [ eq : vis ] ) ,",
    "the residual damping rates are fitted by the numerical diffusivity as @xmath288 for @xmath289 .",
    "note that @xmath290 and @xmath285 are of the same order . while @xmath290 is quite small , the related magnetic diffusion time @xmath291 can be comparable to the dynamical time ( e.g. , bar orbital period ) if the field strength changes substantially across the grid spacing @xmath292 .",
    "for instance , @xmath293 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 typical for tearing modes of magnetic reconnection occurring in our simulations .",
