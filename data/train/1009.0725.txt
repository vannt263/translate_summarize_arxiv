    "sensitivity to perturbations of quantum evolution is one of the main reasons for irreversibility in low dimensional quantum systems .",
    "the fidelity @xcite , later dubbed loschmidt echo ( le ) @xcite , defined as @xmath0 was proposed to measure such a sensitivity .",
    "it is the overlap of an initial state @xmath1 evolved forward up to time @xmath2 with a hamiltonian @xmath3 , with the same state evolved backward in time with a perturbed hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 characterizes the strength of the perturbation .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : mt ] ) can also be interpreted as the overlap at time @xmath2 of the same state evolved forward in time with slightly different hamiltonians .",
    "while the first interpretation gives the idea of irreversibility , the second is related to the idea of sensitivity to perturbations in the hamiltonian .",
    "an important fact is that the le , and other important related quantities like polarization echoes , were measured in several different experimental setups such as nmr @xcite acoustic waves @xcite , wave guides @xcite , microwave billiards @xcite , cold atoms @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite , and quantum chaotic maps implemented with atomic spins @xcite .    in recent years",
    "different time and perturbation regimes of the le have been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "we first summarize the behaviour as a function of time .",
    "for very short times perturbation theory gives gaussian decay [ see e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "this short time transient is followed by an asymptotic regime .",
    "the fundamental difference between quantum chaotic and regular systems lies in this regime . while for the former the decay is exponential , the latter exhibits  on average  a power - law dependence in time [ see reviews @xcite ] .",
    "finally there is a saturation given by the effective size of the hilbert space @xcite .",
    "in addition , we point out that for strongly chaotic systems and very small perturbations , if at heisenberg time the decay has not reached the saturation value , then a crossover to a gaussian decay is observed @xcite .    as a function of the perturbation strength  for chaotic systems  the decay rate of",
    "the le in the exponential regime presents two different types of dependence . for small @xmath5  fermi golden rule ( fgr ) regime  the decay rate is given by the width of the local density of states ( ldos ) , @xmath6 .",
    "the ldos is the distribution of the overlap squared connecting the set of the unperturbed eigenfunctions with the perturbed ones and its width is a measure of the action of a perturbation on the system .",
    "then there is a crossover to a perturbation independent regime when @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the largest classical lyapunov exponent . in this regime  usually called lyapunov regime the decay rate of the le is given by @xmath8 .",
    "this simple picture is supported by semiclassical results based on statistical arguments and by some numerical studies @xcite .",
    "recent works @xcite have nevertheless shown that the accuracy of the above description of the le  which aims to provide a universal picture  is limited .",
    "deviations from the perturbation independence are found usually in the form of oscillations around @xmath8 . moreover , there are cases where deviations are considerably large rendering the lyapunov regime non - existing .",
    "the goal of this paper is to shed some light on the , sometimes very large , deviations from the lyapunov regime .",
    "we show that , after the initial short - time transient , the behaviour of the le ( on average ) is strongly influenced by the squared average fidelity amplitude ( afa ) . in order to do",
    "so we use the semiclassical theory known as dephasing representation ( dr ) @xcite , and a recent result @xcite , derived for local perturbations in billiards , to calculate the decay rate of the afa for uniformly hyperbolic chaotic systems  in particular quantum maps with classical chaotic counterpart  , in the limit of fast decaying correlations  or very large classical lyapunov exponents  as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "our extensive numerical results show that  for quantum maps on the torus  the afa imprints signatures of the perturbation to the decay of the le not only in the fgr regime but also for much stronger perturbations . for a wide range of perturbation strengths , the semiclassical expression obtained for the decay rate of the afa",
    "correctly reproduces the deviations of the le from the  perturbation independent  lyapunov regime .    aside from the dependence of the decay regimes on time and perturbation strength , we know that the type of initial state should be taken into account @xcite",
    ". in particular for semiclassical calculations the initial state must be `` classically meaningful '' @xcite [ like position states or narrow gaussian states ] .",
    "we show numerically that for states which are extended in phase space , as expected the lyapunov regime is difficult to observe and the decay of the le is dominated  at least initially  by the decay of the afa .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : semi ] we introduce the average fidelity amplitude . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dec ] we derive a semiclassical analytical expression the decay rate of the afa , @xmath9 . taking into account that @xmath9 is generally assumed to be equal to @xmath6 , in sec .",
    "[ sec : ldos ] we compare both quantities . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numres ] our results are tested in a paradigmatic system of quantum chaos , a perturbed cat map on the torus .",
    "we show numerically that for general perturbations @xmath6 and @xmath9 can be very different ( sec .",
    "[ sec : res1 ] ) .",
    "then , we study the decay of the le using gaussian initial states for several values of @xmath8 and different perturbation types ( sec .  [ sec : gauss ] ) .",
    "we show that with increasing @xmath8 values the contribution of @xmath9 to the le becomes more relevant . when the initial state is extended in phase space even for small @xmath8 the initial decay rate of the le",
    "is given by @xmath9 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ext ] ) .",
    "we summarize and expose our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "all the decay regimes studied previously in the literature  e.g. @xcite , and reviews @xcite  for the le imply some kind of averaging .",
    "typically either an average over perturbations or over different initial states can be done . throughout this work",
    "we do the latter .",
    "we consider averaging over a number @xmath10 of uniformly distributed  random ",
    "gaussian ( minimum uncertainty ) initial states @xmath11 .",
    "then the average le is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is just the fidelity amplitude ( fa ) corresponding to state @xmath14 . in this section",
    "we focus on the squared average fidelity amplitude [ labeled afa in sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ] @xmath15 we remark that expanding equation  ( [ eq : safadef ] ) , @xmath16 can be expressed as @xmath17 minus twice the real part of the sum of terms of type @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "the average fidelity amplitude is an interesting quantity on its own being a measurable quantity in some of the echo experiments @xcite .",
    "it is known [ e.g. in @xcite to decay exponentially like @xmath20.\\ ] ] for chaotic systems . in general , the calculations seem to induce to the conclusion that @xmath9 is proportional to the width of the ldos @xmath21 .",
    "however in the following subsections we show that this result only holds either when @xmath5 is small [ with respect to @xmath22 , see sec .  [ sec : res1 ] ] or when the perturbation acts on a small [ say localized ] portion of the total phase space .",
    "in addition we find an analytical approximation @xmath9 which will account for the strange  strongly perturbation dependent  behaviour of @xmath23 . in the particular case of quantum maps on the torus ,",
    "a general study of the afa and @xmath9 will be presented elsewhere @xcite .      in this section",
    "we follow the procedure introduced for billiard systems in @xcite to obtain an analytical expression for the decay rate of the afa , but we extend it to a phase space setting ( poincar surface of section ) .",
    "we include a step - by - step demonstration in order for the paper to be as self contained as possible . one key element of this derivation is the use of the dephasing representation ( dr ) which was introduced in @xcite to calculate semiclassically the afa  a very thorough analysis of the dr is given in @xcite .",
    "the approach is an alternative to that of @xcite and makes the calculations more manageable .",
    "it takes advantage of the shadowing theorem @xcite and the initial value representation @xcite .",
    "the fa in the dr is given by @xmath24 where the action difference @xmath25 is the integral of the perturbation along the classical unperturbed orbit , and @xmath26 is the wigner function of the initial state @xmath27 .",
    "we want to average over a basis set of initial states .",
    "the wigner function of the incoherent sum of _ any _ basis set is just a constant , so the average fidelity amplitude does not depend on the type of initial states .",
    "therefore we have @xcite @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 the volume of phase space ) .",
    "although the derivations in this paper can apply to any dynamical system in a poincar surface of section , for simplicity the following calculation will be done assuming we have an abstract map on a phase space of area equal to one ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "since maps are iterated in discrete steps , the time is henceforth represented by an integer @xmath31 .",
    "let us suppose we have a region in phase space of area @xmath32 where the trajectories that pass through @xmath32 are affected by the perturbation .",
    "the complement , with area @xmath33 , is unaffected .",
    "now let us divide all initial points @xmath34 into sets @xmath35 corresponding to trajectories that have visited the perturbed region exactly @xmath36 times after @xmath31 steps .",
    "then equation  ( [ eq : on ] ) can be written as @xcite @xmath37 with @xmath38.\\ ] ] due to the fact that the map is completely chaotic , the probability to hit the perturbed region is approximately equal to the area @xmath32 .",
    "we can thus take the exponential out of the integral and get @xcite @xmath39>_{\\omega_n } \\int_{\\omega_{n ' } } dq dp.\\ ] ] the integral in equation  ( [ eq : approx ] ) is just the fraction of initial conditions that visit the perturbed region exactly @xmath36 times after @xmath31 iterations , so @xmath40    in addition @xmath41\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are just the @xmath31-th iteration of the classical map given an initial condition @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "for strongly chaotic systems , @xmath46 and @xmath47 in equation  ( [ eq : sigmanp ] ) can be treated as uncorrelated - random variables @xcite  at least for @xmath31 small  so that the average of equation  ( [ eq : approx ] ) of the product of exponentials can be expressed as the product of averages .",
    "this assumption would be strictly true in the case the map was a perfect random number generator @xcite in other words , in the limit @xmath48 . therefore , if the average is done over a large number of initial states , comparable to the size of the hilbert space , we get @xmath49>_{\\omega_n}\\approx   < \\exp [ -i \\delta s(q , p,\\sigma)/\\hbar]>^{n'},\\ ] ] with @xmath50 the action difference after one step . using ( [ eq : approx ] )",
    ", ( [ eq : binom ] ) , and ( [ eq : av1 ] ) in equation  ( [ eq : on ] ) we obtain the amplitude of the afa @xmath51 this exponential decay can be rewritten as @xmath52 with @xmath53 the decay rate of the squared afa @xmath54 is then obtained by squaring the modulus of equation  ( [ eq : exp ] ) .",
    "the previous derivation makes equation  ( [ eq : gammafull ] ) ` strictly ' valid in the case of local perturbations and uniformly hyperbolic , chaotic systems or in the case @xmath55 . for local perturbations ( @xmath56 )",
    "a further simplification can be made by series expansion in @xmath32 to obtain an expression equivalent to the one obtained in @xcite .",
    "we here conjecture that equation  ( [ eq : gammafull ] ) gives a good approximation for the decay rate of the afa  for _ any _ @xmath32 and @xmath8 , at least for small times  based mainly on three arguments .",
    "the first being that in @xcite a very similar derivation leading to the width of the local density of states is shown to hold for arbitrary values of @xmath32 [ see next section ] .",
    "the second is that we do know that for @xmath57 there is no need for an @xmath56 approximation in equation  ( [ eq : av1 ] ) and neither is there need for such approximation in the limit @xmath48 .",
    "so , equation  ( [ eq : av1 ] ) will be valid for larger times as @xmath8 increases .",
    "after that there is a crossover to lyapunov decay [ which is observed e.g. in fig .",
    "[ f4figs ] , bottom left panel ] .",
    "the exact time of crossover is difficult to determine because it depends on the form of the perturbation @xcite .",
    "the last reason supporting our conjecture is the eloquent numerical evidence that we present further in the paper [ see section sec .",
    "[ sec : numres ] ] .",
    "particularly , we show that , when the initial states are extended in phase space , e.g. a position state ( on the torus ) , then _ even _ for smaller @xmath8 and @xmath58 ( global perturbation ) the dominating decay rate  at least for initial times  is @xmath59 obtained in equation  ( [ eq : gammafull ] ) .",
    "this last point is illustrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : ext ] .",
    "+      in the bibliography of the le @xcite it is found that the decay rate for small perturbation values ",
    "fgr regime originates from the afa and is given by the width of the ldos ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "its dependence with @xmath5 is quadratic .",
    "it is the aim of this section to compare @xmath9 and @xmath6 for any perturbation value .    by definition",
    "the ldos gives the distribution of the perturbed eigenstates in the unperturbed eigenbasis .",
    "it is well known that for small @xmath5 the shape of the ldos is a lorentzian @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown semiclassically that the shape  in the case of hyperbolic maps and billiards with a deformed boundary as perturbation  is a lorentzian [ breit - wigner ] distribution @xmath60 for perturbations of arbitrarily high intensity , with @xmath61 the result is obtained for a perturbation acting on small region of area @xmath32 and then it is extended to any value @xmath32 .",
    "the width of the ldos can be defined as @xmath62 which corresponds to a distance around the mean value containing approximately @xmath63 of the probability . is 1.963 .",
    "taking the factor equal to 2 gives a distance around the mean containing exactly @xmath64 of the probability .",
    "since this choice is in a sense arbitrary , for the sake of simplicity , we choose the latter . ]",
    "we can now establish the _ actual _ relationship between the width of the ldos and the afa to the decay rate of the le .",

    "it is evident that due to the logarithm , there can appear diverging values .",

    "we note that after this decay it is possible  depending on the values of both @xmath22 and @xmath8  to observe a decay rate given by the lyapunov exponent .    for the numerical simulations we use quantum maps on the torus .",
    "quantum maps are very simple systems that represent a useful tool to explore some of the main properties of classical and quantum chaotic systems @xcite .",

    "we observe that @xmath23 obtained coincides almost perfectly with @xmath59 .",
    "for the sake of clarity and contrast we also included the plot for @xmath21 ( solid blue line ) .",
    "we remark that in the case of extended initial states our conjecture that @xmath9 of equation  ( [ eq : gammafull ] ) gives the correct decay rate of the le is fulfilled for initial times , for arbitrary values of @xmath8 and @xmath32 .",
    "we would like to also point out that after a transient time , if the hilbert space is large enough , then a second regime with decay rate given by @xmath8 might also be observed .",
    "however for large @xmath8 the lyapunov regime becomes increasingly difficult to observe because of the saturation at @xmath152 .     as a function of the squeezing parameter @xmath136 for @xmath153 , @xmath104 and two different values of @xmath116 : ( @xmath98 ) @xmath154 ; ( @xmath111 ) @xmath155 .",

    "[ fig : slice ] ]    another way to illustrate the dependence on the initial state is by varying @xmath136 in equation  ( [ eq : coh ] ) .",

    "[ fig : slice ] we show @xmath142 as a function of the squeezing parameter @xmath136 starting from a momentum state [ @xmath160 ] , passing through a circular coherent state [ @xmath137 ] , over to a position state [ @xmath162 ] .",
    "we plotted this for @xmath104 ( @xmath123 ) , @xmath153 and @xmath166 initial states in the case of perturbation @xmath79 [ equation  ( [ eq : pert ] ) ] .",
    "we took two different values of the rescaled perturbation : @xmath154 ( @xmath98 ) corresponds in figure  [ fig : eco ] to a region where @xmath23 follows @xmath59 and thus the value of the decay rate remains approximately constant ; @xmath155 ( @xmath111 ) corresponds to a region where @xmath142 has already settled around @xmath8 . in this case",
    "we observe a transition from a decay rate dominated by the afa for @xmath167 , @xmath168 , i.e. where the coherent state has been stretched in either in @xmath44 or in @xmath45 by a factor of the order @xmath169 .",
    "the loschmidt echo is a quantity which was introduced as a measure of the instability and irreversibility of a system under an external perturbation .",
    "the lyapunov regime of the le describes how for some parameter values the decay becomes independent of the perturbation and the decay rate is the lyapunov exponent of the classical system .",
    "it is a well known theoretical prediction that can be seen in simulations [ e.g. for the kicked top @xcite , in the stadium billiard @xcite , or a two - dimensional lorentz gas@xcite ] but which for some systems that exhibit generic chaotic behaviour  like quantum maps  can be truly difficult to find due to very strong deviations @xcite . in this work",
    "we have thus set out to try to understand this elusive nature of the lyapunov regime in quantum maps . for these systems",
    "we show that the afa plays a significant role and we dare conjecture is a greater defining feature of a system .",
    "a similar conclusions could be inferred from previous works on billiards with perturbed walls @xcite .",
    "we think the extension of our results to more realistic models , which fulfill the uniformly hyperbolic and chaotic condition , should be straightforward .",
    "we have derived a semiclassical expression @xmath59 for the decay rate of the afa in the case of highly chaotic maps ( large @xmath8 limit ) . using extensive numerical simulations in quantum maps",
    "we have shown that , the decay rate of the le is very well reproduced by @xmath59 for some range of perturbation values . as a consequence ,",
    "there are three regimes depending on the perturbation . for small @xmath116",
    "there is the well known fgr regime .",
    "then there is an oscillating behaviour which can be explained with the decay rate of the afa and finally for very large @xmath116 there is the lyapunov regime .",
    "we point out that the decay rate obtained for the afa correctly explains the oscillations that are observed numerically in this paper but which had been also observed previously @xcite .",
    "the complete understanding of the crossover between the last two regimes is left for further studies @xcite .",
    "we have also compared @xmath59 to the width of the ldos and indicated their fundamental differences when the perturbation is not localized .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the influence of @xmath59 in the decay of the le is enhanced when the initial states are extended in phase space .",
    "we remark that the reasons we find here to the absence of a lyapunov regime are fundamentally different to those found in @xcite where the fluctuations due to different ways of averaging are shown to lead to a double - exponential decay of the le .",
