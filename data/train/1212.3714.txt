    "<S> these results indicate a possible unified framework to reconcile the magnetic and electronic properties of the cuprates and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of such an approach .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1*_#1 _ *    of all the high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors , bi-2212 is the most easily cleaved to reveal atomically flat surfaces and is the preferred material for many angle - resolved photo - emission ( arpes ) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy studies of the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> much is known , therefore , about the electronic structure of this cuprate . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> arpes studies have revealed arcs of quasiparticle spectral weight at the fermi energy @xcite , which on closer examination have been described as pockets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these have strong spectral intensity at the front surface ( the ` arc ' ) and negligible spectral intensity on the back surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior was predicted by the yang - rice - zhang ( yrz ) ansatz as corresponding to pieces of fermi surface characterized by the ( front surface ) poles , and ( ` ghost ' surface ) zeros , of the single particle green s function . @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the electronic structure , however , there is scant information about the high - energy magnetic response ( @xmath5  mev ) in bi-2212 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because bi-2212 is challenging to grow as large single crystals , which are required for inelastic neutron scattering experiments . </S>",
    "<S> thus only a few studies of the magnetic excitations in the cuprates have opted to measure bi-2212 @xcite and these have focused around the antiferromagnetic ordering wavevector @xmath6 , and on energy transfers below about 80  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of information on the high energy magnetic response and its momentum dependence away from @xmath6 of bi-2212 is particularly unfortunate , given the well characterized electronic structure of this cuprate . </S>",
    "<S> such a measurement is also highly relevant for theoretical proposals for magnetically - mediated high-@xmath0 superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> many such theories require the existence of magnetic modes with significant spectral weight over a large fraction of the brillouin zone in the optimally doped cuprates .    </S>",
    "<S> the dramatic improvement in recent years of the energy resolution of cu @xmath3 edge resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) @xcite means that rixs now provides a useful complement to neutron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> it is particularly well suited to very small sample sizes @xmath7  @xmath8 m and can access high energy magnetic excitations above 100  mev .    </S>",
    "<S> this letter reports the first measurements of the high energy magnetic excitations in bi-2212 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe magnetic excitations with a zone boundary energy of @xmath4300  mev in both underdoped and optimally doped bi-2212 , much like a broadened remnant of the magnon excitation in undoped cuprates such as la@xmath1cuo@xmath9 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these excitations are strikingly similar to the boson proposed to explain the high - energy ` kink ' observed in photoemission @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then take a parameterization of the measured electronic structure of bi-2212 @xcite and use it to predict the magnetic excitation spectrum in an approach based on the yang - rice - zhang ansatz for the electronic structure @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we observe a relatively flat continuum of excitations up to about 8  ev , which are charge - transfer excitations from the cu @xmath30 to the o @xmath31 states @xcite . in the 1 - 3  ev range </S>",
    "<S> we see optically forbidden orbital @xmath20-excitations where the cu @xmath32 hole is excited into different orbitals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below 1  ev , single , and multi - spin - flip , excitations are seen . </S>",
    "<S> phonons also contribute below @xmath490  mev , along with elastic scattering at @xmath33  ev .    </S>",
    "<S> the peak in the mid - ir portion of the spectrum occurs around 300  mev , near the brillouin zone boundary . </S>",
    "<S> this is a comparable energy scale to the magnetic excitations seen in other doped cuprates such as la@xmath34sr@xmath35cuo@xmath9 @xcite , and the ybco and ndbco familes of cuprates @xcite , suggesting that this peak corresponds to single magnon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we test this assertion by examining the polarization dependence of this peak @xcite . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> s formalism the dominant term in the intensity of spin - flip scattering can be written as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the ingoing and outgoing x - ray polarizations , respectively , and @xmath39 is a @xmath40 tensor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> assuming a cu@xmath41 ion in tetragonal symmetry , @xmath39 is zero except for @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> these rules work well for describing magnon scattering in insulating cuprates including la@xmath1cuo@xmath9 @xcite , sr@xmath1cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 @xcite , and ndbacuo@xmath44 @xcite . in near - grazing - exit geometry </S>",
    "<S> these rules predict that the magnon should be enhanced in @xmath11 polarized x - rays and suppressed for @xmath12 polarized x - rays . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) the @xmath45  mev peak indeed follows this polarization dependence . </S>",
    "<S> further , the elastic line at 0  ev is suppressed in the @xmath11 channel , consistent with expectations for non - resonant charge scattering . for a near - grazing incidence geometry </S>",
    "<S> the magnon intensity is enhanced for @xmath12 polarized x - rays and fig .  </S>",

    "<S> symmetry direction ( black dots ) . left : heavily underdoped non - superconducting ( ud0  k ) ; right : optimally doped @xmath15  k ( od92  k ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are decomposed into the dispersive inelastic magnetic scattering ( blue line ) , the elastic scattering ( red line ) and the charge - transfer/ @xmath20-excitations background ( gray dotted line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data were collected at @xmath46  k with grazing - exit geometry ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath11-polarized incident x - rays . ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we examine the @xmath27-dependence of the od92  k and ud0  k spectra along the @xmath48 symmetry direction using a grazing - exit configuration and @xmath11 polarized x - rays , to maximize the spin - flip scattering and minimize the elastic line . </S>",
    "<S> the peak is seen to disperse to high energy near the zone boundary , which further substantiates the assignment of the peak to single spin - flip processes , as multi - spin - flip and phonon excitations would be expected to show different dispersions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the peak is significantly broader than the experimental resolution ( which is 150  mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , although magnon - like excitations persist in bi-2212 , they are significantly damped . </S>",
    "<S> a similar paramagnon excitation was also recently reported in other doped cuprates nd@xmath49ba@xmath50cu@xmath51o@xmath52 , yba@xmath1cu@xmath51o@xmath53 , yba@xmath1cu@xmath9o@xmath54 and yba@xmath1cu@xmath51o@xmath52 @xcite .    in order to analyze the spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we decompose it into its different components . </S>",
    "<S> the smooth background underneath the peak , which is largely independent of @xmath27 , is from charge - transfer processes and the tail of the @xmath20-excitations . at zero energy transfer </S>",
    "<S> a small amount of elastic scattering is visible , although this is strongly suppressed with @xmath11 polarized x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> phonons contribute below @xmath55  mev and multi - magnon processes contribute to the high energy tail above the peak @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon and multi - spin - flip contributions can sometimes be separated from the single spin flip contribution in undoped cuprates for which the single spin - flip excitation is a well - defined , resolution - limited magnon @xcite . in doped cuprates </S>",
    "<S> , however , the peak broadening makes this difficult so , although the peak in scattering can be assigned to spin flip scattering , the contributions of phonons and multi - spin - flip processes can not be unambiguously separated .     based on arpes - derived parameters @xcite for ( a ) underdoped non - superconducting and ( b ) optimally doped @xmath15  k bi-2212 . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars represent in uncertainty in determining the experimental paramagnon energy . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the yrz form for the electronic structure of underdoped bi-2212 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we track the peak in the magnetic scattering as denoted by the green arrows in fig  [ fig2 ] ( see the supplementary materials for further details ) and plot the dispersion in fig  [ fig3 ] for the ( a ) ud0  k and ( b ) od92  k samples . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting dispersion shows the central result of this paper : that high energy spin excitations persist from @xmath56 in bi-2212 and are relatively unchanged on increasing the hole concentration from underdoped to optimally doped .    </S>",
    "<S> there are a large number of different theoretical approaches for calculating the spin response of doped cuprates , usually starting with the hubbard model , the @xmath57 model , or models based on stripe correlations . </S>",
    "<S> these models are then solved by mean field techniques or calculations based on small clusters . </S>",
    "<S> one difficulty is that few of these approaches allow for calculations of the electronic _ and _ magnetic properties using a single set of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it has been argued that local moments contribute to the spin response at low energies @xcite and local moment stripe - based theories provide a very natural description of the ` hourglass ' feature seen in the magnetic response near @xmath6 @xcite , but it is difficult to connect these theories with the itinerant behavior seen by arpes .    </S>",
    "<S> the yrz phenomenology @xcite , which was inspired by calculations on arrays of coupled two leg ladders @xcite , is advantageous in that it provides a relatively simple explanation for arpes data and an easy way to implement parametrization for the electronic structure of the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> it was used in just this way for underdoped bi-2212 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3](c ) plots this electronic structure for ud0  k bi-2212 ( @xmath18 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has also proved successful in describing many other _ electronic _ properties of the cuprates @xcite .    in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was argued that calculations based on the quasiparticle band structure given by yrz are also capable of describing the magnetic response of the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> here we test this assertion by comparing the magnetic response from yrz , using parameters set by arpes experiments , with rixs data on samples made in the same way . the approach taken in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was to set yrz in the framework of earlier calculations by brinckmann and lee @xcite for @xmath58 , based on a slave boson mean field treatment of the @xmath57 model . </S>",
    "<S> the key feature suggested by the success of yrz is that one must go beyond mean field theory and take into account the binding between fermionic ` spinons ' and bosonic ` holons ' . </S>",
    "<S> the basic element is a particle - hole ` bubble ' diagram of yrz propagators . a geometric series of such diagrams is then summed to infinite order leading to an ` rpa ' expression for the magnetic response . </S>",
    "<S> ( see the supplementary materials for a technical description . ) </S>",
    "<S> the parameters in this phenomenological approach were fixed by fits of the yrz model to arpes measurements on bi-2212 crystals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fits assume a pseudogap that decreases linearly with doping and vanishes in the overdoped regime , consistent with other arpes studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters were then used to calculate @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a broad paramagnon at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that a highly intense mode arises around @xmath59 with an energy of @xmath60  mev @xcite , similar to the ` resonance mode ' seen in neutron scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , this is above the maximum @xmath61 accessible in cu @xmath3 edge rixs .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3 ] compares the results of these calculations to the peak in the magnetic response observed for ( a ) ud0  k and ( b ) od92  k samples . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations reproduce the energy dispersion , except for a small discrepancy in the ud0  k sample at high @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the overall level of agreement in the energy of the paramagnon excitation is encouraging given that the calculations are entirely constrained by the electronic structure measurements @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that a comparison of the experimental and theoretical widths is difficult to perform in a meaningful way , as the width of the measured spectrum is dominated by the experimental resolution ( 150  mev ) and the width is increased by the contribution from phonons and multi spin flip processes . </S>",
    "<S> also , yrz makes an ansatz for the coherent part of the single particle green s function and neglects the incoherent piece . </S>",
    "<S> the latter takes the form of a large ` hump ' in arpes data suggesting that in fact lifetime effects play an important role . </S>",
    "<S> a more sophisticated theory , in which this effect is accounted for , would probably predict larger widths .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , we find similar intensities in the ud0  k and od92  k samples , although it is difficult to measure rixs on an absolute intensity scale . </S>",
    "<S> neutron scattering measurements observe a strong suppression of spectral weight around @xmath6 in doped cuprates @xcite . taken together </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray and neutron results then suggest a strong @xmath27-dependence to the doping dependence , with spectral weight largely conserved , except around @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> such a @xmath27-dependence can be reproduced within yrz @xcite , and other theoretical approaches such as ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . upon increasing the doping from heavily underdoped to optimally </S>",
    "<S> doped , the calculations predict a small drop of 15% in the intensity of the paramagnon . in future theoretical work </S>",
    "<S> we intend to include the possible appearance of an ordered moment in the yrz description at low doping . </S>",
    "<S> this should improve the accuracy of the theory for @xmath62 , which is currently dominated by the large pseudogap .    </S>",
    "<S> our results also have relevance to arpes studies . </S>",
    "<S> several measurements of bi-2212 , and other cuprates , observe a kink of the electronic bands in the mid - ir energy scale @xcite . in bi-2212 </S>",
    "<S> this feature occurs around 340  mev and it is weakly doping dependent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these characteristics are similar to the magnetic excitations near the brillouin zone boundary reported here , and indeed , calculations @xcite have shown that a paramagnon with just the characteristics of the mode we measure would produce the observed phenomenology of the high energy kink . </S>",
    "<S> however , it remains unclear whether the high energy kink is due to electron - boson coupling , or to other effects @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , we have used rixs to determine the high energy magnetic excitation spectrum of bi-2212 . </S>",
    "<S> we find broad dispersive paramagnons with a zone boundary energy of @xmath4300  mev and a weak dependence on doping . </S>",
    "<S> the observed energy dispersion of these excitations are reasonably well reproduced by calculations based on the yrz model @xcite with parameters fixed by the measured electronic structure of bi-2212 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that this is a promising path towards a possible unified description of the magnetic and electronic properties of the cuprates , as opposed to models that focus on just one of these degrees of freedom and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of such an approach . </S>",
    "<S> future work should improve the limitations of the current theory and test whether other spectroscopies can be incorporated into the same unified picture . </S>"
