    "laser interferometric detectors of gravitational waves such as the ligo @xcite and virgo @xcite are expected to be operational by the turn of the century .",
    "gravitational waves from coalescing binary systems of black holes and neutron stars are relatively ` clean ' waveforms in the sense that they are easier to model and for this reason they are amongst the most important candidate sources for interferometric detectors .",
    "binary systems are also valuable sources of astrophysical information as one can probe the universe up to cosmological distances .",
    "for instance , statistical analysis of several binary coalescences enables the estimation of the hubble constant to an accuracy better than 10% @xcite .",
    "events that produce high signal - to - noise ratio can be potentially used to observe such non - linear effects , such as gravitational wave tails , and to put general relativity into test in the strongly non - linear regime @xcite . due to the weak coupling of gravitational radiation with matter",
    "the signal waveform is in general very weak and will not stand above the detector noise .",
    "in addition to the on - going efforts to reduce the noise , and hence increase the sensitivity of the detector , a considerable amount of research activity has gone into the development of efficient and robust data analysis techniques to extract signals buried in very noisy data . for a recent review on gravitational waves from compact objects and their detection see thorne @xcite .",
    "various data analysis schemes have been suggested for the detection of the ` chirp ' waveform from such systems @xcite . among them",
    "the technique of weiner filtering is the most promising @xcite . briefly",
    ", this technique involves correlating the detector output with a set of templates , each of which is tuned to detect the signal with a particular set of parameters .",
    "this requires the signal to be known to a high level of accuracy .",
    "the fully general relativistic waveform from a coalescing binary system of stars is as yet unavailable . in the absence of such an exact solution",
    ", there have been efforts to find solutions perturbatively .",
    "most of the work done in this area aims at computing the waveform correct to a high degree of accuracy so that theoretical templates computed based on them will obtain a large signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) when correlated with the detector output if the corresponding signal is present . in general , the number of parameters increases as we incorporate the higher order corrections .",
    "it is clear that the number of templates depends upon the number of signal parameters . as a consequence , the computing power for an on - line analysis will be greater for a larger number of parameters . in view of this restriction in computing power it is necessary to choose the templates in an optimal manner .",
    "this paper in part deals with this question .",
    "investigations till now have been restricted to either choosing a finite subset of the signal space as templates @xcite or choosing templates from the ` newtonian ' or the ` first post - newtonian ' family of waveforms @xcite .",
    "we generalize this problem by using the language of differential geometry .",
    "we show that it is unnecessary to restrict oneself to templates that are matched exactly to any particular signal .",
    "differential geometry has been used in statistics before ( see @xcite and references therein ) and the standard approach is to treat a set of parameterised probability distributions corresponding to a particular statistical model as a manifold .",
    "the parameters of the distribution serve as coordinates on this manifold . in statistical theory one",
    "frequently comes across the fisher information matrix whose inverse gives a lower bound for the errors in the estimation of the parameters of a distribution .",
    "the fisher information matrix turns out to be a very natural metric on the manifold of probability distributions and this metric can be used profitably in understanding the properties of a particular statistical model . here in our paper",
    "we treat the set of coalescing binary signals corresponding to various parameters of the binary as a submanifold in the linear space of all detector outputs .",
    "we show in this paper that both the above mentioned manifolds are equivalent as far as their metrical properties are concerned .",
    "the geometric approach turns out to be useful not only in clarifying various aspects of signal analysis but also helps us to pose the question of optimal detection in a more general setting .",
    "once a signal has been detected we can estimate the parameters of the binary .",
    "we assume that the parameters of the signal are the same as those of the template with which the maximum correlation is obtained .",
    "the errors involved in such an estimation has been worked out by several authors @xcite , for the case of ` high ' snr and for the newtonian and post - newtonian waveforms using a single and a network of detectors . for the case of low snrs one has to resort to numerical simulations .",
    "we have started a project to carry out exhaustive numerical simulations specifically designed to compute the errors in the estimation of parameters and covariances among them at various post - newtonian orders , for circular and eccentric orbits , with and without spin effects and for different optical configurations of the interferometer . in this paper",
    "we report the results for the case of the initial ligo configuration taking into account only the first post - newtonian corrections and assuming circular orbits . going beyond this",
    "needs tremendous amount of computing power which is just becoming available .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ waveforms ]",
    "we describe the waveform from a coalescing binary system at various post - newtonian orders .",
    "we introduce , following @xcite , a set of parameters called ` chirp times ' .",
    "these parameters are found to be very convenient when we carry out monte carlo simulations .",
    "it turns out that the covariance matrix is independent of these parameters and hence it is sufficient to carry out the simulations only for a particular set of parameters . in section [ sm ]",
    "we develop a geometric interpretation of signal analysis .",
    "we begin by introducing a metric on the manifold from a scalar product , which comes naturally from the theory of matched filtering and then show that this metric is the same as the one used by amari @xcite . using the geometric approach",
    "we address the question of optimal filter placement and show that for the purpose of detection it is optimal to choose the templates outside the signal manifold .",
    "the covariance matrix of errors and covariances is shown to be the inverse of the metric on the manifold . in section [ sec_espar ]",
    "we discuss the results of our simulations and compare the numerically obtained values and those suggested by the covariance matrix .",
    "we find substantial discrepancies in the predictions of the two methods .",
    "it is believed that the coalescing binary waveform shuts off abruptly at the onset of the plunge orbit .",
    "this has a major effect on the computations of the covariance matrix as well as on the monte carlo simulations .",
    "we discuss the effects of higher post - newtonian corrections to the waveform .",
    "we also emphasisize the use of the instant of coalescence as a parameter in order to determine the direction to the source rather than the time of arrival @xcite .",
    "finally in section [ sec_con ] we summarise our results and indicate future directions .",
    "for the purpose of constructing templates for on - line detection , it is sufficient to work with the so called _ restricted _ post - newtonian gravitational waveform . in this approximation",
    "the post - newtonian corrections are incorporated only in the phase of the waveform , while ignoring corresponding corrections to the amplitude @xcite .",
    "consequently , the restricted post - newtonian waveforms only contain the dominant frequency equal to twice the orbital frequency of the binary computed up to the relevant order . in the restricted post - newtonian approximation the gravitational waves from a binary system of stars , modeled as point masses orbiting about each other in a circular orbit , induce a strain @xmath0 at the detector given by @xmath1 , \\label { wave}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the instantaneous gravitational wave frequency , the constant @xmath3 involves the distance to the binary , its reduced and total mass , and the antenna pattern of the detector @xcite , and the phase of the waveform @xmath4 contains several pieces corresponding to different post - newtonian contributions which can be schematically written as @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the dominant newtonian part of the phase and @xmath7 represents the @xmath8th order post - newtonian correction to it . in the quadrupole approximation",

    "@xmath11 is the chirp time .",
    "the newtonian part of the phase is characterised by three parameters : ( i ) the _ time of arrival _",
    "@xmath16 when the signal first becomes _ visible _ in the detector , ( ii ) the _ phase _ @xmath14 of the signal at the time of arrival and ( iii ) the _ chirp mass _ @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the reduced and the total mass of the binary , respectively . at this level of approximation two",
    "coalescing binary signals of the same chirp mass but of different sets of individual masses would be degenerate and thus exhibit exactly the same time evolution .",
    "this degeneracy is removed when post - newtonian corrections are included .",
    "when post - newtonian corrections are included the parameter space of waveforms acquires an extra dimension . in this paper",
    "we show that even when post - newtonian corrections up to relative order @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the velocity of light , are included in the phase of the waveform it is possible to make a judicious choice of the parameters so that the parameter space essentially remains only three dimensional as far as the detection problem is concerned .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the evolution of the waveform must be known to a reasonably high degree of accuracy and that further off - line analysis would be necessary to extract useful astrophysical information .    with the inclusion of corrections up to second post - newtonian order",
    "the phase of the waveform becomes @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath6 is given by ( [ phasen ] ) and the various post - newtonian contributions are given by @xmath23 \\label { phase1pn}\\ ] ] @xmath24 \\label { phase1.5pn}\\ ] ] and @xmath25 .",

    "the total chirp time now consists of four pieces : the newtonian contribution @xmath11 is given by ( [ nct ] ) and the various post - newtonian contributions are @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 the phase ( [ phasetotal ] ) contains the reduced mass @xmath18 in addition to the chirp mass @xmath32 taking ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) to be the post - newtonian mass parameters the total mass and the reduced mass are given by @xmath35 @xmath36 note that in the total chirp time @xmath27 of the signal the 1.5 post - newtonian contribution appears with a negative sign thus shortening the epoch of coalescence .    with the inclusion of higher order post - newtonian corrections a chirp template",
    "is characterised by a set of four parameters which we shall collectively denote by @xmath37 @xmath38 at the first post - newtonian approximation instead of working with the parameters @xmath39 we can equivalently employ the set @xmath40 for the purpose of constructing templates .",
    "this , as we shall see later , has some advantageous .",
    "however , at post - newtonian orders beyond the first we do not have a unique set of chirp times to work with .    the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath14 are _ kinematical _ that fix the origin of the measurement of time and phase , respectively , while the newtonian and the post - newtonian chirp times are _ dynamical _ parameters in the sense that they dictate the evolution of the phase and the amplitude of the signal .",
    "it may be mentioned at this stage that in most of the literature on this subject authors use the set of parameters @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the instant of coalescence and @xmath43 is the phase of the signal at the instant of coalescence . in terms of the chirp times",
    "we have introduced , @xmath42 is the sum of the total chirp time and the time of arrival and @xmath43 is a combination of the various chirp times and @xmath44 @xmath45",

    "in this section we apply the techniques of differential geometry to the problem of detecting weak signals embedded in noise . in section [ sms ]",
    "we introduce the concept of the signal manifold and elaborate on the relationship of our approach with that of amari @xcite .",
    "our discussion of the vector space of all detector outputs is modeled after the discussion given in @xcite . in section",
    "[ detect ] we deal with the problem of choosing a set of filters for on - line analysis which would optimise the task of detection of the signal . in section [ 2pnsec ]",
    "we deal with the dimensionality of the chirp manifold when we incorporate higher order post - newtonian corrections .",
    "it is found , that due to covariances between the parameters , it is possible to introduce an effective dimension which is less than the dimension of the manifold .",
    "this has very important implications for the detection problem .",
    "the output of a gravitational wave detector such as the ligo , will comprise of data segments , each of duration @xmath56 seconds , uniformly sampled with a sampling interval of @xmath57 , giving the number of samples in a single data train to be @xmath58 .",
    "each data train can be considered as a @xmath59-tuple @xmath60 @xmath61 being the value of the output of the detector at time @xmath62 .",
    "the set of all such @xmath59 tuples constitutes a @xmath59-dimensional vector space @xmath63 where the addition of two vectors is accomplished by the addition of corresponding time samples . for later convenience",
    "we allow each sample to take complex values . a natural basis for this vector space",
    "is the _ time basis _",
    "@xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the vector and component indices respectively .",
    "another basis which we shall use extensively is the fourier basis which is related to the time basis by a unitary transformation @xmath67 : @xmath68,\\\\   { \\bf e}_m & = & \\hat u^{\\dagger mn}{\\bf\\tilde e}_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt n }   \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^{n-1}{\\bf\\tilde e}_n\\exp \\left[-\\frac{2\\pi i m n}{n}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all vectors in @xmath63 are shown in boldface , and the fourier basis vectors and components of vectors in the fourier basis are highlighted with a ` tilde ' .    in the continuum case",
    "each data train can be expanded in a fourier series and will contain a finite number of terms in the expansion , as the output will be band limited .",
    "the expansion is carried out over the exponential functions @xmath69 which are precisely the fourier basis vectors defined above .",
    "though the index @xmath65 takes both positive and negative values corresponding to positive and negative frequencies it is both , possible and convenient to allow @xmath65 to take only positive values @xcite .",
    "thus the vector space @xmath63 can be considered as being spanned by the @xmath59 fourier basis vectors implying immediately that the number of independent vectors in the time basis to be also @xmath59 .",
    "this is the content of the nyquist theorem which states that it is sufficient to sample the data at a frequency which is twice as large as the bandwidth of a real valued signal , where the bandwidth refers to the range of positive frequencies over which the signal spectrum is non zero .",
    "this factor of two does not appear in the vector space picture as we allow in general for complex values for the components in the time basis .",
    "a gravitational wave signal from a coalescing binary system can be characterised by a set of parameters @xmath70 belonging to some open set of the @xmath71-dimensional real space @xmath72 .",
    "the set of such signals @xmath73 constitutes a @xmath71-dimensional manifold @xmath74 which is embedded in the vector space @xmath63 .",
    "the parameters of the binary act as coordinates on the manifold .",
    "the basic problem of signal analysis is thus to determine whether the detector output vector @xmath75 is the sum of a signal vector and a noise vector , @xmath76 , or just the noise vector , @xmath77 , and furthermore to identify which particular signal vector , among all possible .",
    "one would also like to estimate the errors in such a measurement .    in the absence of the signal",
    "the output will contain only noise drawn from a stochastic process which can be described by a probability distribution on the vector space @xmath63 .",
    "the covariance matrix of the noise @xmath78 is defined as , @xmath79 where an * denotes complex conjugation and an overbar denotes an average over an ensemble . if the noise is assumed to be stationary and ergodic then there exists a noise correlation function @xmath80 such that @xmath81 . in the fourier basis",
    "it can be shown that the components of the noise vector are statistically independent @xcite and the covariance matrix in the fourier basis will contain only diagonal terms whose values will be strictly positive : @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that the covariance matrix has strictly positive eigenvalues .",
    "the diagonal elements of this matrix @xmath83 constitute the discrete representation of the power spectrum of the noise @xmath84 .",
    "we now discuss how the concept of matched filtering can be used to induce a metric on the signal manifold .",
    "the technique of matched filtering involves correlating the detector output with a bank of filters each of which is tuned to detect the gravitational wave from a binary system with a particular set of parameters .",
    "the output of the filter , with an impulse response @xmath85 , is given in the discrete case as @xmath86.\\ ] ] the snr ( @xmath87 ) at the output is defined to be the mean of @xmath88 divided by the square root of its variance : @xmath89^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] by maximising @xmath87 we can obtain the expression for the matched filter @xmath90 matched to a particular signal @xmath91 as @xmath92}{\\tilde c_{nn}},\\ ] ] where @xmath87 has been maximised at the @xmath93 data point at the output and where @xmath94 where @xmath71 is the number of parameters of the signal .",
    "we now introduce a scalar product in @xmath63 .",
    "for any two vectors @xmath75 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 in terms of this scalar product , the output of the matched filter @xmath85 , matched to a signal @xmath97 , can be written as , @xmath98 as @xmath83 is strictly positive the scalar product defined is positive definite . the scalar product defined above on the vector space @xmath63 can be used to define a norm on @xmath63 which in turn can be used to induce a metric on the manifold .",
    "the norm of a vector @xmath75 is defined as @xmath99 .",
    "the ratio for the matched filter can be calculated to give @xmath100 .",
    "the norm of the noise vector will be a random variable @xmath101 with a mean of @xmath102 as can be seen by writing the expression for the norm of the noise vector and subsequently taking an ensemble average .",
    "the distance between two points infinitesimally separated on @xmath74 can be expressed as a quadratic form in the differences in the values of the parameters at the two points : @xmath103 the components of the metric in the coordinate basis are seen to be the scalar products of the coordinate basis vectors of the manifold .",
    "since the number of correlations we can perform on - line is finite , we can not have a filter corresponding to every signal .",
    "a single filter though matched to a particular signal will also detect signals in a small neighbourhood of that signal but with a loss in the snr .",
    "the metric on the manifold quantifies the drop in the correlation in a neighbourhood of the signal chosen . taking the output vector to be @xmath75 and two signal vectors @xmath104 and @xmath105 and using schwarz s inequality we have , @xmath106 as is apparent the drop in the correlation can be related to the metric distance on the manifold between the two signal vectors .",
    "we now discuss amari s @xcite work in the context of using differential geometry in statistics and elaborate on the relationship with the approach we have taken .",
    "the set of parametrised probability distributions corresponding to a statistical model constitute a manifold .",
    "the parameterized probability distributions in the context of signal analysis of gravitational waves from coalescing binaries are the ones which specify the probability that the output vector will lie in a certain region of the vector space @xmath63 given that a signal @xmath73 exists in the output which we denote as @xmath107 since it is not our intention to develop amari s approach any further we will be brief and will make all the mathematical assumptions such as infinite differentiability of functions , interchangeability of the differentiation and expectation value operators , etc .",
    "the set of probability distributions @xmath108 where @xmath109 , constitutes a manifold @xmath110 of dimension @xmath71 . at every point on this manifold",
    "we can construct a tangent space @xmath111 on which we can define the coordinate basis vectors as @xmath112 .",
    "any vector @xmath113 in this tangent space can be written as a linear combination of these coordinate basis vectors .",
    "we now define @xmath71 random variables @xmath114 .",
    "it can easily be shown that @xmath115 .",
    "we assume that these @xmath71 random variables are linearly independent .",
    "by taking all possible linear combinations of these random variables we can construct another linear space @xmath116 . each vector @xmath117 in @xmath116",
    "can be written as @xmath118 .",
    "the two vector spaces @xmath111 and @xmath116 are isomorphic to each other , which can be shown explicitly by making the correspondence @xmath119 .",
    "the vector space @xmath116 has a natural inner product defined on it which is the covariance matrix of the @xmath71 random variables @xmath120 .",
    "this scalar product can be carried over to @xmath111 using the correspondence stated above .",
    "the metric on the manifold can be defined by taking the scalar product of the coordinate basis vectors @xmath121 in statistical theory the above matrix @xmath122 is called the fisher information matrix .",
    "we will also denote the fisher matrix , as is conventional , as @xmath123 .",
    "it is clearly seen that orthogonality between vectors in the tangent space of the manifold is related to statistical independence of random variables in @xmath116 .",
    "if we take the case of gaussian noise the metric defined above is identical to the one obtained on the signal manifold by matched filtering .",
    "gaussian noise can be described by the distribution , @xmath124 } { \\left[\\ ( 2\\pi)^n \\det\\left[c_{ij}\\right]\\ \\right]^{1/2 } } = \\frac{\\exp\\left [      -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum\\limits_{j , k=0}^{n-1}{\\tilde c^{-1}_{jk } \\tilde n^j \\tilde n^{k*}}\\right ] } { \\left[\\ ( 2\\pi)^n \\det\\left[\\tilde c_{ij}\\right]\\ \\right]^{1/2 } } = \\frac{\\exp\\left [      -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n-1}{\\frac{\\tilde n^i \\tilde n^{i*}}{\\tilde c_{ii}}}\\right ] } { \\left[\\ ( 2\\pi)^n \\det\\left[\\tilde c_{ij}\\right]\\ \\right]^{1/2}},\\ ] ] where in the last step we have used the diagonal property of the matrix @xmath125 which implies that @xmath126 .",
    "as the noise is additive @xmath108 can be written as @xmath127 .",
    "assuming gaussian noise we can write the expressions for the random variables @xmath128 as , @xmath129 where in the last step we have used @xmath130 .",
    "the covariance matrix for the random variables @xmath120 can be calculated to give @xmath131 which is the same metric as defined over the signal manifold .",
    "thus , both the manifolds @xmath74 and @xmath110 are identical with respect to their metrical properties .",
    "we will henceforth restrict our attention to the signal manifold @xmath74 .",
    "for the purpose of our analysis we will choose a minimal set of parameters characterizing the gravitational wave signal from a coalescing binary .",
    "we consider only the first post - newtonian corrections . in section [ waveforms ]",
    "we have already introduced the four parameters @xmath132 .",
    "we now introduce an additional parameter for the amplitude and call it @xmath133 .",
    "the signal can now be written as @xmath134 , where , @xmath135 .",
    "numerically the value of the parameter @xmath55 will be the same as that of the snr obtained for the matched filter .",
    "we can decompose the signal manifold into a manifold containing normalised chirp waveforms and a one - dimensional manifold corresponding to the parameter @xmath55 .",
    "the normalised chirp manifold can therefore be parameterized by @xmath136 .",
    "this parameterization is useful as the coordinate basis vector @xmath137 will be orthogonal to all the other basis vectors as will be seen below .    in order to compute the metric , and equivalently the fisher information matrix",
    ", we use the continuum version of the scalar product as given in @xcite , except that we use the two sided power spectral density .",
    "this has the advantage of showing clearly the range of integration in the frequency space though we get the same result using the discrete version of the scalar product .",
    "using the definition of the scalar product we get @xmath138 recall that in the stationary phase approximation the fourier transform of the coalescing binary waveform is given by @xmath139 $ ] and @xmath140 , where @xmath141 are given by equations ( [ eqs1]-[eqs2 ] ) , @xmath142 and @xmath143 note , in particular , that in the phase of the waveform the parameters occur linearly thus enabling a very concise expression for the components of @xmath144 the various partial derivatives are given by @xmath145 where we have introduced @xmath146 on substituting the above expressions for the partial derivatives in eq . ( [ gamma2 ] ) we get , @xmath147 the above definition of the amplitude parameter @xmath148 as in culter and flannagan @xcite , disjoins the amplitude of the waveform from the rest of the parameters . since @xmath149 is pure imaginary and @xmath150 s are real , it is straightforward to see from eq .",
    "( [ gamma3 ] ) that @xmath151 the rest of the components @xmath122 are seen to be independent of all the parameters except @xmath55 _ i.e. _ @xmath152 . as @xmath153 is unity for the normalised manifold the metric on the normalised manifold is flat",
    "this implies not only that the manifold is intrinsically flat ( in the stationary phase approximation ) but also that the coordinate system used is cartesian .",
    "if instead of the chirp time @xmath11 we use the parameter @xmath33 then the metric coefficients will involve that parameter and the coordinate system will no longer remain cartesian .",
    "we now use the formalism developed to tackle the issue of optimal filter placement .",
    "till now , it has been thought necessary to use a finite subset of the set of chirp signals as templates for detection .",
    "we show that this is unduly restrictive .",
    "we suggest a procedure by which the detection process can be made more ` efficient ' by moving the filters out of the manifold .",
    "it must be emphasised that the algorithm presented below is both , simplistic and quite adhoc and is not necessarily the best .",
    "moreover , we have implemented the algorithm only for the newtonian case where the computational requirements are not very heavy .",
    "the signal manifold corresponding to higher post - newtonian corrections will be a higher dimensional manifold and here the computational requirements will be substantial",
    ". the choice of optimal filters which span the manifold will then be crucial .",
    "detection of the coalescing binary signal involves computing the scalar product of the output of the detector with the signal vectors .",
    "subsequently one would have to maximise the correlations over the parameters and the number so obtained would serve as the statistic on the basis of which we can decide whether a signal is present in the given data train .",
    "geometrically , this maximization corresponds to minimizing the angle between the output vector and the vectors corresponding to the normalised signal manifold . using the cosine formula , @xmath154 it is clear that as @xmath155 is unity for the vectors belonging to the normalised signal manifold , maximising the scalar product is equivalent to minimising @xmath156 which is the distance between the tip of the output vector and the manifold .",
    "given the constraints of computational power one would be able to evaluate only a finite number of these scalar products , say @xmath157 , in a certain amount of time depending on the data train length and the padding factor .",
    "it is therefore necessary to be able to choose the @xmath157 filters in such a manner that the detection probability is maximal .",
    "we will need efficient on - line data analysis for two reasons : ( i ) to isolate those data trains which have a high probability of containing a signal and ( ii ) to determine the parameters of the binary early on during the inspiral and to use them for dynamical recycling techniques .",
    "due to the finiteness of the filter spacing the signal parameters will in general not correspond to any of the @xmath157 filters chosen and this will lead to a drop in the maximum possible correlation . till",
    "now attention has been focussed on identifying a set of optimal set of filters which are a discrete subset of the manifold .",
    "if detection is the sole purpose then the differential geometric picture suggests that confining the filter vectors to the signal manifold is an unnecessary restriction and in fact non optimal .",
    "thus it is worthwhile to explore making a choice of filters outside the manifold .",
    "the filter vectors will thus belong to @xmath63 but will not , in general , correspond to any signal .",
    "it is , of course , true that we are sacrificing on the maximum possible correlation obtainable ( when the signal s parameters coincide with those of the filter ) .",
    "thus the problem essentially is to select @xmath157 filter vectors which optimize the detection the efficiency of which depends upon the properties of the manifold .    in general",
    "a single filter vector would have to pick up signals over a region of the manifold .",
    "the extent of this region is determined by fixing a threshold on the correlation between the filter and any signal in the region .",
    "we will denote this threshold by @xmath34 , where @xmath34 takes a value which is close to , but less than unity .",
    "the typical value suggested for @xmath34 is @xmath158 , @xcite . for a given filter @xmath85 and a threshold @xmath34 the region on the manifold corresponding to the filter",
    "will be denoted as @xmath159 , where @xmath160 .",
    "geometrically this region is the intersection of an open ball in @xmath63 of radius @xmath161 ( using the distance defined by the scalar product ) , with center @xmath85 , and the manifold .",
    "the @xmath157 filters taken together would have to ` span ' the manifold which means that the union of the regions covered by each filter would be the manifold itself _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath162 .",
    "if the filter @xmath85 lies on the manifold , then the correlation function @xmath163 will reach its maximum value of unity in @xmath159 when @xmath164 and will fall off in all directions .",
    "this means that the signals in the region which are further away from the filter are less likely to be picked up as compared to those in the immediate neighbourhood of the filter @xmath85 .",
    "we assume that a finite subset of the normalised signal manifold has been chosen to act as filters by some suitable algorithm @xcite , which taken together span the manifold .",
    "the number of filters will be determined by the available computing power .",
    "consider one of these filters @xmath85 , the region corresponding to it for a threshold of @xmath34 , @xmath159 , and an arbitrary normalised vector @xmath165 which belongs to @xmath63 but not necessarily @xmath74 . by correlating the vector @xmath165 with vectors in @xmath159",
    "we obtain the correlation function @xmath166 .",
    "we select that @xmath165 to serve as a more optimal filter which maximises the average of this correlation function : @xmath167 where @xmath168 $ ] . in the last step above the integration and",
    "the scalar product operations in the above equation have been interchanged .",
    "moreover , for the normalised chirp manifold the metric does not depend upon the parameters in the coordinate system we have chosen and therefore , @xmath122 is a constant and the factor @xmath169 cancels .",
    "we now use schwarz s inequality to maximise the average correlation to obtain , @xmath170 where @xmath171 is just a normalisation constant .",
    "we implemented the above algorithm for filter placement for the case of newtonian signals with certain modifications .",
    "the normalised chirp waveform consists of three parameters @xmath172 .",
    "if we keep @xmath16 and @xmath173 fixed then the tip of the signal vector traces out a circle as we vary @xmath14 . as any circle lies on a plane we can express a signal vector as a linear sum of two vectors where the two vectors differ only in the phase parameter and we take this phase difference to be @xmath174 .",
    "thus we need only two mutually orthogonal filters to span the phase parameter .",
    "the time of arrival parameter @xmath16 is also a ` convenient parameter ' as by the use of fast fourier transforms the correlations for arbitrary time of arrivals can be performed at one go .",
    "it is therefore not profitable for us to maximise the average correlation over the phase parameter @xmath14 and the time of arrival @xmath16 .    in view of the above restrictions we modified the the filter placement algorithm .",
    "we consider the correlation function for the case when the filter vector is on the manifold .",
    "we define the ` line of curvature ' to be the curve on the manifold along which the correlation function falls the least .",
    "figure ( [ fig_dets ] ) illustrates the correlation function plotted as a function of @xmath11 along the line of curvature .",
    "it is seen from the contour diagram of the numerically computed correlation function that the line of curvature lies nearly on the submanifold @xmath175 constant , of the normalised chirp manifold .",
    "we take two curves",
    "passing through the point @xmath85 in the region @xmath159 :    1 .",
    "@xmath175 constant ,  @xmath176 and 2 .",
    "@xmath175 constant ,  @xmath177 .",
    "we obtain one filter for each of the two curves by evaluating eq .",
    "[ avcorr ] where the domains of integration correspond to the segments of the curves defined .",
    "having determined the two filters we again plot the correlation function along the line of curvature as a function of @xmath11 in figure ( [ fig_dets ] ) .",
    "the region of the manifold selected corresponds to a range of @xmath178  secs to @xmath179  secs in the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "it is interesting to note that we could have translated these values keeping the difference same without affecting our results .",
    "it can be seen that the correlation has a minimum at the center . in order to get a flatter correlation curve we select a linear combination of the original filter and the one obtained by averaging with suitable weights attached to each filter .",
    "this performs reasonably well as shown by the thick curve in the figure .",
    "the importance of having a flatter correlation function lies in the fact all the signals in a region can be picked up with equal efficiency and the drop in the maximum possible correlation can be compensated for by lowering the threshold .",
    "the average correlation obtained for the optimal filter is only marginally better than that obtained for the filter placed on the manifold .    in the discussion above ,",
    "we had started with a fixed number of filters @xmath157 on the manifold and obtained another set of @xmath157 filters which performs marginally better than the former set .",
    "equivalently we can try to increase the span of each filter retaining the same threshold but reducing the number of filters required . in figure",
    "[ fig_dets ] we observe that the optimal filter chosen spans the entire region considered with a threshold greater than @xmath180 , whereas the filter on the manifold spans about half the region at the same threshold .",
    "this indicates that by moving the filters out of the manifold in the above manner it may be possible to reduce the number of filters by a factor of two or so .",
    "one must however , bear in mind that the bank of filters obtained in this way are not optimal",
    ". there is scope to improve the scheme further .",
    "our analysis is indicative of this feature .",
    "it has already been shown that the first post - newtonian waveform is essentially one - dimensional @xcite .",
    "we argue in this subsection that even the second post - newtonian waveform is essentially one - dimensional and a one - dimensional lattice suffices to filter the waveform .",
    "a newtonian waveform is characterised by a set of three parameters consisting of the time of arrival , the phase of the signal at the time of arrival and chirp mass ( equivalently , newtonian chirp time ) . in this case , for the purpose of detection , one essentially needs to employ a one - dimensional lattice of filters corresponding to the chirp mass , the time of arrival being taken care by the fast fourier transform algorithm and the phase being determined using a two - dimensional basis of orthogonal templates . when post - newtonian corrections are included in the phase of the waveform the number of parameters increases apparently implying that one needs to use a two - dimensional lattice of filters corresponding to , say , the chirp and reduced masses ( equivalently the newtonian and post - newtonian chirp times ) which in turn means that the number of templates through which the detector output needs to be filtered goes up by several orders of magnitude .",
    "one of us ( bss ) has recently shown that for the purpose of detection it is sufficient to use a one - dimensional lattice of filters even after first post - newtonian corrections are included in the phase of the waveform and the relevant parameter here is the sum of the newtonian and post - newtonian chirp times .",
    "what happens when corrections beyond the first post - newtonian order are incorporated in the phase of the waveform ?",
    "the coalescing binary waveform is now available up to second post - newtonian order @xcite .",
    "blanchet et al .",
    "argue that the phase correction due to the second order post - newtonian ( 2pn ) term induces an accumulated difference of 10 cycles in a total of 16000 .",
    "consequently , it is important to incorporate the 2pn terms in the templates . when the 2pn terms are included it is useful to consider that the full waveform is parameterised by three additional parameters , corresponding to the chirp times at the 1 , 1.5 and 2pn order ( cf .",
    "sec [ waveforms ] ) , as compared to the newtonian waveform .",
    "of course , as far as the detection problem is concerned there is only one additional parameter since the chirp times are all functions of the two masses of the binary .",
    "however , for the purpose of testing general relativity one can consider each of the chirp times to be independent of the rest @xcite .",
    "our problem now is to find the dimensionality of the parameter space of a 2pn waveform . to this end",
    "we consider the _ ambiguity function _",
    "@xmath181 which is nothing but the correlation function of two normalised waveforms one of whose parameters ( @xmath182 ) are varied by holding the parameters of the other fixed ( @xmath183 ) : @xmath184 it is useful to think of @xmath183 to be the parameters of a template and @xmath182 to be that of a signal . with this interpretation",
    "the ambiguity function simply gives the span of a filter in the parameter space .",
    "the ambiguity function for the full waveform is a four - dimensional surface since there are four independent parameters . to explore the effective dimensionality of the parameter we consider the set of parameters to be @xmath185 where @xmath186 and @xmath187 are the two masses of the binary .",
    "we have shown the contours of the ambiguity function maximised over @xmath16 and @xmath14 ( since these two parameters do not explicitly need a lattice of templates ) in fig .",
    "[ ambcont ] .",
    "the template at the centre of the plot corresponds to a binary waveform with @xmath188 and the signal parameters are varied over the entire astrophysically interesting range of masses : @xmath189m_\\odot.$ ] from these figures we find that the ambiguity function is almost a constant along a particular line in the @xmath186@xmath187 plane .",
    "this means that a template at the centre of the grid spans a relatively large area of the parameter space by obtaining a correlation very close to unity for all signals whose masses lie on the curve along which the ambiguity function roughly remains a constant .",
    "it turns out that the equation of this curve is given by @xmath190 let us suppose we begin with a two - dimensional lattice of filters corresponding to a certain grid ( albeit , nonuniform ) laid in the @xmath186@xmath187 plane .",
    "several templates of this set will have their total chirp time the same .",
    "now with the aid of just one template out of all those that have the same chirp time we can effectively span the region that is collectively spanned by all such filters .",
    "more precisely , we will not have an appreciable loss in the snr in replacing all templates of a given total chirp time by one of them .",
    "consequently , the signal manifold can be spanned by a one - dimensional lattice of templates .",
    "in this section we discuss the accuracy at which the various parameters of a coalescing binary system of stars can be estimated .",
    "all our results are for a single interferometer of the initial ligo - type which has a lower frequency cutoff at 40 hz . at present",
    "it is beyond the computer resources available to us to carry out a simulation for the advanced ligo . in the first part of this section we briefly review the well known results obtained for the variances and covariances in the estimation of parameters using analytical methods .",
    "analytical methods assume that the snr is sufficiently large ( the so - called strong signal approximation ) and implicitly use a continuum of the parameter space . in reality , however , these assumptions are not necessarily valid and hence it is essential to substantiate the results obtained using analytical means by performing numerical simulations . in the second part of this section we present an exhaustive discussion of the monte carlo simulations we have performed to compute the errors and covariances of different parameters .",
    "as we shall discuss below the computation of errors using the covariance matrix is erroneous even at an snr of 10 - 20 .",
    "our estimation of 1-@xmath191 uncertainty in the various parameters , at low snrs , is substantially larger than those computed using the covariance matrix .",
    "however , for high values of the snr ( @xmath192@xmath193 ) monte carlo estimation agrees with the analytical results .      in recent years",
    "a number of authors have addressed issues related to the variances expected in the parameter estimation @xcite , in the standard method of computing the variances in the estimation of parameters one makes the assumption that the snr is so large that with the aid of such an approximation one can first construct the fisher information matrix @xmath123 and then take its inverse to obtain the covariance matrix @xmath194 in the strong signal approximation the fisher information matrix and the covariance matrix are given by @xmath195 as we have seen before the fisher information and consequently the covariance matrix is block diagonal and hence there is no cross - talk , implying vanishing of the covariances between the amplitude and the other parameters .",
    "consequently , we need not construct , for the purpose of weiner filtering , templates corresponding to different amplitudes .",
    "the judicious choice of parameters has also allowed a very elegant expression for the fisher information matrix .",
    "it is particularly interesting to note that the information matrix does not depend on the values of the various parameters , except for the amplitude parameter , and hence is a constant as far as the parameter space of the normalised waveforms is considered .    for the purpose of numerical simulations",
    "it is convenient to choose the set @xmath196 where @xmath55 is the amplitude parameter , @xmath16 and @xmath14 are the time of arrival of the signal and its phase at the time of arrival , and @xmath11 and @xmath197 are the newtonian and the post - newtonian coalescence times . for noise in realistic detectors , such as ligo",
    ", the elements of the fisher information matrix can not be expressed in a closed form and , for the set of parameters employed , it is not useful to explicitly write down the covariance matrix in terms of the various integrals since the errors and covariances do not have any dependence on the parameters .",
    "we thus evaluate the information matrix numerically and then take its inverse to obtain the covariance matrix . instead of dealing with the covariance matrix",
    "@xmath198 it more instructive to work with the matrix of standard deviations and correlation coefficients @xmath199 which is related to the former by @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the 1-@xmath191 uncertainty in the parameter @xmath202 the off - diagonal elements of @xmath199 take on values in the range @xmath203 $ ] indicating how two different parameters are correlated : for @xmath204 @xmath205 , indicates that the two are perfectly correlated , @xmath206 means that they are perfectly anticorrelated and @xmath207 implies that they are uncorrelated . since the information matrix is block - diagonal , the amplitude parameter is totally uncorrelated with the rest and thus an error in the measurement of @xmath55 will not reflect itself as an error in the estimation of the other parameters and vice versa .",
    "in contrast , as we shall see below , newtonian chirp time is strongly anticorrelated to post - newtonian chirp time , which implies that if in a given experiment @xmath11 happens to be estimated larger than its true value then it is more likely that @xmath197 will be estimated to be lower than its actual value .",
    "such correlations are useful as far as detection is concerned since they tend to reduce the number of templates needed in filtering a given signal .",
    "on the other hand , strong correlations increase the volume in the parameter space to which an event can be associated at a given confidence level .",
    "it seems to be in general true that a given set of parameters do not satisfy the twin properties of having small covariances and reducing the effective dimension of the manifold for the purpose of filtering .",
    "we elaborate on this point below .    given a region in a parameter space",
    ", it is useful to know the proper volume ( as defined by the metric ) of the manifold corresponding to the said region . in choosing a discrete set of filters for the detection problem one has to decide upon the maximum allowable drop in the correlation due to the finite spacing .",
    "once this is fixed , the number of filters can be determined from the total volume of the manifold . for the detection problem",
    "it is beneficial to have a small volume whereas if the waveform is parameterized in such a way such that the manifold corresponding to it covers a large volume , then one can determine the parameters to a greater accuracy . as a simple example let us consider a two - dimensional toy model : @xmath208 .",
    "we compare different signal manifolds each corresponding to a different parameterizations of the waveform .",
    "we assume that the covariance matrix and its inverse , the fisher information matrix , to be : @xmath209 the volume of the manifold corresponding to a region @xmath210 of the parameter space is given as , @xmath211d\\lambda_1d\\lambda_2 =   \\int_{\\cal k}\\gamma_{11}\\gamma_{22}\\left[1 - \\epsilon\\right]d\\lambda_1d\\lambda_2,\\ ] ] where @xmath212 is the correlation coefficient .",
    "it can be clearly seen that if the correlation coefficient is small , keeping the variances in the parameters , fixed then the volume of the manifold is maximal .",
    "since the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath197 are highly anticorrelated the proper volume corresponding to the region reduces to zero showing that the effective dimensionality of the manifold is less .",
    "though , in principle , the variances and covariances are independent of the chirp time , in reality there arises an indirect dependence since one terminates a template at a frequency @xmath213 ( where @xmath19 is the total mass of the binary ) corresponding to the plunge radius at @xmath214 therefore , larger mass binaries are tracked over a smaller bandwidth so much so that there is less frequency band to distinguish between two chirps of large , but different , total mass .",
    "consequently , at a given snr the error in the estimation of chirp times is larger for greater mass binaries .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ gamma2 ] ) are somewhat sensitive to the value of the upper cutoff .",
    "( this also explains why the errors in the estimation of the chirp and reduced masses are larger for greater mass binaries @xcite . ) in the following we assume that the noise power spectral density is that corresponding to the initial ligo for which a fit has been provided by finn and chernoff @xcite . for an snr of 10 the matrix @xmath199 is given by @xmath215 for the newtonian signal , and by @xmath216 for the first post - newtonian corrected signal . while computing varianaces and covariances the integrals in equation ( [ gamma3 ] )",

    "if we consider binaries of different total masses , all located at the same distance , then a more massive binary produces a stronger snr so that in reality it may be possible to determine its parameters more accurately than that of a lighter binary . in fig .",
    "[ truedependence ] we have plotted @xmath191 s for binaries all located at the same distance as a function of total mass .",

    "however , for @xmath19 larger than a certain @xmath225 the increase in snr is not good enough to compensate for the drop in @xmath219 so much so that the uncertainties in @xmath11 and @xmath197 increase beyond @xmath225 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 , however , falls off monotonically .",
    "in this section we present the first in a series of efforts to compute the covariance matrix of errors through numerical simulations for a coalescing binary waveform at various post - newtonian orders .",
    "analytical computation of the covariance matrix , as in the previous section , gives us an idea of the covariances and variances but , as we shall see in this section , at low snr s it grossly underestimates the errors .",
    "quite apart from the fact that the assumptions made in deriving the covariance matrix might be invalid at low snr s , in a realistic detection and data analysis , other problems , such as discreteness of the lattice of templates , finite sampling of the data , etc .",
    ", do occur .",
    "it therefore seems necessary to check the analytical calculations using numerical simulations to gain further insight into the accuracy at which physical parameters can be measured .",
    "this section is divided into several parts : in the first part we highlight different aspects of the simulation , in the second part we briefly discuss the choice of templates for the simulation , in the third we elaborate on the monte carlo method that we have adopted to carry out our simulations and in the fourth we discuss problems that arise in a numerical simulation .",
    "the results of our study are discussed in the next section .",
    "let @xmath226 be a signal of strength @xmath55 characterised by a set of parameters @xmath227 @xmath228 in data analysis problems one considers a discrete version @xmath229 of the waveform @xmath226 sampled at uniform intervals in @xmath230 @xmath231 where @xmath57 denotes the constant interval between consecutive samples and @xmath59 is the total number of samples .",
    "the sampled output @xmath232 of the detector consists of the samples of the noise plus the signal : @xmath233 the _ sampling rate , _ @xmath234 ( also referred to as the _ sampling frequency _ ) is the number of samples per unit time interval . in a data analysis problem",
    "the sampling frequency is determined by the signal bandwidth .",
    "if @xmath235 is the signal bandwidth , i.e. , if the fourier transform of the signal is only nonzero over a certain interval @xmath236 then it is sufficient to sample at a rate @xmath237 in our case there is a lower limit in the frequency response of the detector since the detector noise gets very large below a seismic cutoff at about 1040 hz . as mentioned in the last section there is also an upper limit in frequency up to which a chirp signal is tracked since one does not accurately know the waveform beyond the last stable orbit of the binary .",
    "this corresponds to gravitational wave frequency @xmath238 for a neutron star - neutron star ( ns - ns ) binary @xmath239  hz while for a ns - black hole ( of 10 @xmath240 ) ( ns - bh ) binary @xmath241  hz . due to constraints arising out of limited computational power , we terminate waveforms at @xmath242 hz even when @xmath219 is larger than 1000 hz .",
    "such a shutoff is not expected to cause any spurious results since , even in the case of least massive binaries of ns - ns , which we consider in this study , more than 99 % of the ` energy ' is extracted by the time the signal reaches 750 hz .",
    "we have carried out simulations with two types of upper cutoff :    1 .",
    "one in which all templates , irrespective of their total mass , are shutoff beyond 750 hz . , 2 .   a second in which the upper frequency cutoff is chosen to be @xmath242 hz or @xmath243 whichever is lower .",
    "consistent with these cutoffs the sampling rate is always taken to be @xmath244 khz .",
    "( we have carried out simulations with higher sampling rates and found no particular advantage in doing so nor did we find appreciable changes in our results . )    in all our simulations , as in the previous section , we take the detector noise power spectral density @xmath245 to be that corresponding to initial ligo @xcite . for the purpose of simulations we need to generate noise corresponding to such a power spectrum .",
    "this is achieved by the following three steps :    1 .",

    "compute its fourier transform @xmath248 and 3 .",
    "multiply the fourier components by the square root of the power spectral density , @xmath249    the resultant random process has the requisite power spectrum . in the above ,",
    "the second step can be eliminated since the fourier transform of a gaussian random process is again a gaussian , but with a different variance .",
    "in other words we generate the noise directly in the fourier domain . the simulated detector output , in the presence of a signal @xmath250 in the fourier domain",
    "is given by @xmath251 where @xmath252 is the discrete fourier transform of the signal .      to filter a newtonian signal",

    "moreover , there exists a two - dimensional basis for the phase parameter which allows the computation of the best correlation with the aid of just two filters .",
    "consequently , the parameter space is essentially one - dimensional in the case of newtonian signals and two - dimensional in the case of post - newtonian signals .",
    "( however , as shown in section [ 2pnsec ] it is to be noted that for the purpose of detection the effective dimensionality of the parameter space , even with the inclusion of second post - newtonian corrections , is only one - dimensional . )",

    "as described in @xcite filters uniformly spaced in @xmath11 and @xmath197 covers the parameters space efficiently .      in order to compute variances and covariances numerically ,",
    "we employ the monte carlo method .",
    "the basic idea here is to mimic detection and estimation on a computer by performing a very large number of simulations so as to minimize the uncertainties induced by noise fluctuations . in our simulations",
    "we generate a number of detector outputs @xmath257 each corresponding to a definite signal @xmath258 of a certain strength , but corresponding to different realisations of the random process @xmath259 computation of the covariance matrix involves filtering each of these detector outputs through an a priori chosen set ( or lattice ) of templates @xmath260 where @xmath261 denotes the number of templates .",

    "we discuss these and other related issues next .",
    "the actual templates chosen , say for the parameter @xmath277 in a given ` experiment ' depend on the true parameters of the signal , the number of noise realisations employed and the expected value of the error .",

    "a factor of 2 arises because for each filter in the @xmath11@xmath197 space we will need two templates corresponding to the two independent values of the phase @xmath14 : @xmath286 and @xmath287 in the case of a newtonian signal , the lattice being one - dimensional , one can afford a much higher resolution and range .",
    "even with the aid of a mere 201 templates we can probe at a @xmath288 resolution with a @xmath289 range .",
    "we start off a simulation with the pretension that there is no knowledge of what the @xmath290 s are .",

    "in particular , we make sure that the templates at the boundary of the chosen range do not click even once and the skewness of the distribution is negligible .",
    "when for a certain @xmath268 a rough gaussian distribution is observed then we carry out a simulation with a larger number of trials ( typically 5000 ) .",
    "we subject the measured values in this larger simulation to the very same tests described above .",
    "we only consider for further analysis such simulations which ` pass ' the above tests and determine the estimates , variances and covariances of the parameters using the measured values , with the aid of equation ( [ mccovar1 ] ) .",
    "there are several sources of numerical errors that tend to bias the results of a simulation unless proper care is exercised to rectify them . in this section we point out the most important ones and show how they can be taken care of . due to memory restrictions , the present version of our codes work with single precision except the fft , which is implemented in double precision . in future implementations",

    "<S> the detection of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources is probably one of the most keenly awaited events in the history of astrophysics . </S>",
    "<S> the paucity of gravitational wave sources and the relative difficulty in detecting such waves , as compared to those in the electromagnetic domain , necessitate the development of optimal data analysis techniques to detect the signal , as well as to extract the maximum possible information from the detected signals . </S>",
    "<S> coalescing binary systems are one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that such sources are easier to model and thus one can design detection strategies particularly tuned to such signals . </S>",
    "<S> a lot of attention has been devoted in the literature studying such techniques and most of the work has revolved around the weiner filtering and the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of the binary system . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate such techniques with the aid of differential geometry which provides geometric insight into the problem . </S>",
    "<S> such a formalism allows to explore the merits and demerits of a detection scheme independent of the parameters chosen to represent the waveform . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism also generalises the problem of choosing an optimal set of templates to detect a known waveform buried in noisy data . </S>",
    "<S> we stress the need for finding a set of _ convenient _ parameters for the waveform and show that even after the inclusion of the second - order post - newtonian corrections , the waveform can essentially be detected by employing a one - dimensional lattice of templates . </S>",
    "<S> this would be very useful both for the purpose of carrying out the simulations as well as for the actual detection process . after setting up such a formalism </S>",
    "<S> we carry out a monte carlo simulation of the detection process for the initial ligo / virgo configuration for the first post - newtonian corrected coalescing binary waveform . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results of our simulations with the currently available estimates of the accuracies in the determination of the parameters and the probability distribution of the maximum likelihood estimators . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the covariance matrix underestimates , by over a factor of two , the actual errors in the estimation of parameters even when the signal - to - noise ratio is as high as 20 . as only a tiny fraction of the events </S>",
    "<S> is expected to be detected with a signal - to - noise higher than this value , the covariance matrix is grossly inadequate to describe the errors in the measurement of the parameters of the waveform . </S>",
    "<S> it is found from our monte carlo simulations that the deviations from the covariance matrix are more in the case of the first post - newtonian waveform than in the case of the newtonian one . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of higher - order post - newtonian corrections introduces new parameters that are correlated with those at the lower post - newtonian waveform . </S>",
    "<S> such correlations are expected to further increase the discrepancy of the covariance matrix results with those inferred from monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , numerical simulations that take into account post - newtonian corrections beyond the first post - newtonian order are needed in order to get a clearer picture about the accuracy in the determination of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that with the aid of the instant of coalescence the direction to the source can determined more accurately than with the time of arrival . </S>"
