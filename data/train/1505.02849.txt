    "investigating the internal structure of hadrons is one of the most important subjects in hadron physics .",
    "the motivation for the investigation is that we expect the existence of exotic hadrons , which are not able to be classified as @xmath8 for baryons nor @xmath9 for mesons .",
    "actually , the fundamental theory of strong interaction , qcd , does not prohibit such exotic systems as long as they are color singlet , and there are indeed several exotic hadron candidates which can not fit into the classifications by the constituent quark models  @xcite . in order to clarify the internal structure of exotic hadron candidates and to discover genuine exotic hadrons ,",
    "great efforts have been continuously made in both experimental and theoretical sides . in this context , it is very encouraging that charged quarkonium - like states and charmonium - pentaquark states were observed in the heavy quark sector by belle  @xcite and by lhcb  @xcite , respectively .    in this article",
    "we focus on the @xmath3 resonance and theoretically investigate its structure in terms of the @xmath10 component . historically this resonance was discovered as a threshold enhancement in both the neutral and charged @xmath1 mass spectra in the @xmath11 reaction at @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "several experimental and theoretical studies have followed in , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite , respectively , and today the @xmath13 resonance is attributed a three - star status in the particle data group table  @xcite .",
    "its mass and width are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively  @xcite , but a relatively narrow width , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath16  @xcite was reported as well .",
    "in addition , the small ratio of the @xmath3 branching fractions @xmath17 has been observed  @xcite .",
    "its spin / parity has been expected to be @xmath4 from the beginning  @xcite , and this was supported by a recent experiment  @xcite .",
    "then , a difficulty emerges ; assuming @xmath4 , @xmath3 couples to the @xmath18 channel in @xmath2 wave , and hence @xmath3 , as a @xmath19 state , should inevitably decay to the @xmath18 channel to some extent in a quark model , which contradicts the above experimental results and implications .",
    "this implies that @xmath3 might have some nontrivial structure than usual @xmath8 state .    in this study , in order to describe @xmath3 , we perform a coupled - channel analysis of the @xmath2-wave @xmath1 , @xmath20 , @xmath18 , and @xmath21 scatterings . for this purpose",
    "we employ the so - called chiral unitary approach  @xcite , which is formulated with the meson ",
    "baryon coupled - channels scattering equation in an algebraic form based on the combination of the chiral perturbation theory and the unitarization of the scattering amplitude .",
    "one of the most remarkable properties of this approach is that a simple driving term , or interaction kernel , provided by the chiral lagrangian with a small number of free parameters can reproduce experimental observables such as cross sections fairly well .",
    "the most important application of the chiral unitary approach is the description of the @xmath22 resonance  @xcite . in this article",
    "we apply the chiral unitary approach to the strangeness @xmath23 sector , where @xmath0 resonances exist . in the chiral unitary approach",
    "the @xmath23 sector was already studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the one hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite a @xmath0 state below the @xmath24 threshold was discussed and identified with @xmath25 . on the other hand , in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors obtained several @xmath0 poles such as @xmath26 , @xmath3 , and @xmath27 together with many hadronic resonances in @xmath28 to @xmath29 . especially in ref .",
    "@xcite they found that in a flavor @xmath30 symmetric world @xmath3 is a member of two degenerated octets , which also contain one of the two-@xmath22 poles coming from the @xmath31 bound state , @xmath32 , and so on . in this study",
    "we extend the analyses in refs .",
    "@xcite by concentrating on the phenomena near the @xmath1 threshold and on @xmath3 . in the following",
    "we will show that the chiral unitary approach in @xmath23 can qualitatively reproduce the experimental data of the @xmath5 and @xmath33 mass spectra , dynamically generate a @xmath3 pole as an @xmath2-wave @xmath1 molecular state near the @xmath1 threshold , and naturally explain the decay properties of @xmath3 .",
    "first of all we formulate the meson  baryon scattering amplitude @xmath34 in @xmath2 wave in the chiral unitary approach , where @xmath35 is the center - of - mass energy and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the channel indices .",
    "the scattering amplitude is the solution of the bethe ",
    "salpeter equation in a coupled - channels algebraic form @xmath38 with the interaction kernel @xmath39 taken from the chiral perturbation theory and the meson ",
    "baryon loop function @xmath40 .",
    "the treatment of the algebraic form was justified first by the so - called on - shell factorization  @xcite and then by the dispersion relation and the @xmath41 method  @xcite . in this study",
    "we consider the system with @xmath23 and charge @xmath42 or @xmath43 , where we take into account six two - body channels ( @xmath33 , @xmath44 , @xmath5 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 ) for the neutral states and similarly six channels ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ) for the charged states .",

    ", the interaction is expressed as @xmath57 with the @xmath36th channel meson decay constant @xmath58 , baryon energy @xmath59 , the squared center - of - mass energy @xmath60 , and the baryon and meson masses @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the @xmath36th channel , respectively . in this study",
    "we use the physical masses unless explicitly mentioned .",
    "the factor @xmath63 is the clebsch ",
    "gordan coefficient determined from the group structure of the flavor @xmath30 symmetry and its value is listed in table  [ tab : coff0 ] .",
    "the meson decay constants are chosen at their physical values  @xcite : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . since @xmath39 in eq .",
    "depends only on the center - of - mass energy @xmath35 , we can put @xmath39 out of the loop integral in the scattering equation , which hence becomes an algebraic form in eq .  .",
    "for the meson  baryon loop function @xmath67 , we take a covariant expression and calculate the integral with the dimensional regularization . as a result ,",
    "the loop function depends on a subtraction constant @xmath68 in each channel at the regularization scale @xmath69 .",
    "the explicit expression of the loop function can be found in ref .",
    "an important point to be noted is that the interaction kernel does not contain free parameters at the present order and its strength is fixed entirely by the coefficients @xmath63 and the meson decay constants .",
    "therefore , only the subtraction constant in each channel is the model parameter . in this study",
    "we assume the isospin symmetry for the subtraction constants , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath70 , so we will have four model parameters in neutral and charged @xmath23 systems , respectively",
    ".    .coefficients @xmath71 for the channels in @xmath72 and @xmath23 . from these values",
    "we can obtain the coefficients for the channels in @xmath73 and @xmath23 by using the relation @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we have explained , we have four subtraction constants as the model parameters . first we fix them by using the so - called natural renormalization scheme  @xcite , which can exclude explicit pole contributions from the loop functions . in the natural renormalization scheme",
    ", we introduce a certain energy @xmath77 at which we achieve the consistency of the low - energy theorem with respect to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "namely , since we take the interaction @xmath78 as the leading order term of the chiral perturbation theory , we require that the scattering amplitude @xmath79 should coincide with the interaction @xmath78 at certain `` low '' energy according to the low - energy theorem .",
    "we represent this energy as @xmath77 : @xmath80 with @xmath81 in every channel @xmath36 . according to the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , we fix this matching energy scale as the mass of the `` target '' baryon of the scatterings , i.e. , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , or @xmath84 . is on the left - hand cut of the @xmath18 channel .",
    "nevertheless , we employ this energy as the matching scale , since the @xmath18 contribution to @xmath85 is found negligible . ] as a result , we obtain the subtraction constants in the second , third , and fourth columns of table  [ tab : neutral ] , to which we refer as the parameter sets  @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , respectively . with the parameter set  @xmath86 , we find two resonance poles as @xmath0 states with @xmath4 ; each pole is in the second ( unphysical ) riemann sheets of the open channels , whose thresholds are lower than @xmath89 .",
    "one pole is located at @xmath90 , which corresponds to the pole studied in ref .",
    "@xcite as the @xmath26 resonance .",
    "we have found that the energy dependence of the weinberg ",
    "tomozawa interaction in the @xmath18 channel is essential to the appearance of @xmath26 .",
    "actually , by taking into account only the @xmath18 channel and switching off couplings to other channels , we obtain a resonance pole at a similar position in the @xmath18 dynamics .",
    "the mechanism is the same as that of the broad @xmath22 pole in the chiral unitary approach , to which the energy dependence of the weinberg ",
    "tomozawa interaction in the @xmath91 channel is essential .",
    "in addition to the @xmath26 pole , another pole appears at @xmath92 just below the @xmath1 threshold , whose properties are listed in the second column of table  [ tab : neutral ] .",
    "we expect that the latter pole can be identified with the @xmath3 resonance and originates from the @xmath1 bound state . on the other hand , with the parameter sets  @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    ", we obtain no poles near the @xmath1 threshold as @xmath3 . however",
    ", we will not take these parameter sets seriously , since they give larger value of the ratio @xmath93 with larger @xmath94 value introduced below and can be excluded by the experimental results .",
    "let us now concentrate on the @xmath0 state near the @xmath10 threshold in the parameter set  @xmath86 .",
    "the structure of the @xmath0 state can be investigated with the coupling constants and compositeness .",
    "actually , from table  [ tab : neutral ] the coupling constants and compositeness indicate a large @xmath10 component in the @xmath0 state .",
    "especially the @xmath10 compositeness , @xmath95 , dominates the sum rule   with its small imaginary part .",
    "this result strongly indicates that the @xmath0 state is indeed a @xmath1 molecular state , on the basis of the similarity to the bound state case ; the wave function of the @xmath96 state can be similar to that of a bound state dominated by the @xmath1 channel .",
    "we also note that , although the coupling constant approximately satisfies the isospin relation @xmath97 , the @xmath1 compositeness largely breaks the corresponding relation @xmath98 .",
    "this is because the @xmath0 state is located very close to the @xmath33 threshold .",
    "this fact will induce further effects of the isospin symmetry breaking on @xmath3 , such as the difference of the @xmath33 and @xmath44 mass spectra , due to the difference of their thresholds .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath33 compositeness implies a coupled - channels extension of the near - threshold scaling in @xmath2 wave discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to the @xmath1 component , the @xmath0 state has a remarkable property of its small decay width with the small imaginary part of the pole position @xmath99 , which can be seen also in refs .",
    "this decay property can be understood by considering the structure of the coefficient @xmath63 .",
    "namely , as shown in table  [ tab : coff0 ] , the transitions @xmath33 , @xmath100 are forbidden at the leading order , so the decay of the @xmath1 quasibound state to the @xmath24 channel is highly suppressed .",
    "actually , the decay to @xmath24 takes place through a multiple scattering of @xmath101 , since the @xmath10-@xmath21 coupling is the strongest among the coupled channels  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the @xmath102 transition is not strong compared to , _",
    "e.g. _ , the @xmath103 one in the @xmath22 case ; the coefficient @xmath104 in the isospin basis is @xmath105  @xcite , while that of @xmath103 in @xmath106 is @xmath107  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath0 state as a @xmath1 molecule can not couple strongly to @xmath24 nor @xmath18 as the decay channels and hence the decay width becomes very small .",
    "moreover , the above argument can also explain the small ratio of the @xmath3 branching fractions @xmath108",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we note that higher - order contributions to the interaction , such as the @xmath2- and @xmath109-channel born terms , can bring tree - level couplings of @xmath110 and may give a decay width @xmath111 .    next ,",
    "in order to make things more accurate , we fit the @xmath112 and @xmath33 mass spectra to the experimental data taken from the decay processes @xmath113 and @xmath114 in ref .",
    "the scale of two mass spectra is fixed with the central values of @xmath115 = ( 1.3 \\pm 0.5 ) \\times 10^{-3}$ ] and @xmath116 = ( 8.1 \\pm 3.0 ) \\times 10^{-4}$ ]  @xcite , respectively . in this study , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate the two mass spectra with the correct phase - space factor and a constant prefactor @xmath117 as @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the invariant mass of the @xmath120 or @xmath33 system and @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) is the momentum of @xmath123 ( hyperon @xmath124 ) in the @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) rest frame . the constant @xmath117 is common to the two modes , since we expect that both the two mass spectra are obtained with the decay of @xmath3 as a @xmath127 molecular state , and @xmath117 is determined by the fitting procedure together with the subtraction constants .",
    "moreover , the scattering amplitude @xmath128 [ @xmath54 ( @xmath129 ) , @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) ] is calculated as @xmath132 where we have used the @xmath133 state in our convention @xmath134 from the best fit to the @xmath5 and @xmath33 mass spectra shown in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : ky ] is that , although we employ the simplest interaction , i.e. , the weinberg ",
    "tomozawa interaction , our scattering amplitude qualitatively reproduces the experimental @xmath140 peaks in both the @xmath5 and @xmath33 mass spectra .",
    "especially we emphasize that the @xmath33 mass spectrum shows a rapid enhancement at its threshold , which is a consequence of the fact that there is @xmath3 near the @xmath33 threshold .",
    "the peak height of the enhancement reflects how strong @xmath3 couples to the @xmath33 channel , or in other words how much @xmath3 contains the @xmath33 component . in this sense",
    ", it is essential to observe both the @xmath1 and @xmath5 mass spectra and to determine the relative strength between them in experiments .",
    "the enhancement of the @xmath33 mass spectrum can be evaluated with the ratio of the two branching fractions as @xmath141 }    { \\mathcal{b } [ \\lambda _ { c}^{+ } \\to \\xi ( 1690)^{0 } k^{+ }       \\to ( \\bar{k}^{0 } \\lambda ) k^{+ } ] } ,    \\label{eq : r}\\ ] ] whose experimental value is @xmath142 / [ ( 1.3 \\pm 0.5 ) \\times 10^{-3 } ] = 0.62 \\pm 0.33 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "theoretically @xmath93 is obtained by the ratio of integrals of the two mass spectra , and the result is shown in table  [ tab : neutral ] .",
    "the theoretical values of @xmath93 overestimate the experimental one , and especially the parameter sets  @xmath87 and @xmath88 can be excluded . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath93 value of the set  fit is in @xmath143 errors of the experimental value , although the statistical error is not small for the experimental value .",
    "therefore , an experimental determination of @xmath93 can constrain more the @xmath1 scattering amplitude and the structure of the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "we note that the @xmath3 pole in the parameter set  fit is located in the first riemann sheet of the @xmath33 , @xmath144 , and @xmath47 channels and in the second riemann sheet of the @xmath5 , @xmath45 , and @xmath145 channels .",
    "therefore , this pole exists above the @xmath129 threshold ( @xmath146 ) but in the first riemann sheet of this channel , which is connected smoothly from the pole position of parameter set  @xmath86 . in this meaning , strictly speaking , the peak seen in the @xmath5 mass spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : ky ] is a cusp at the @xmath33 threshold rather than the usual breit  wigner resonance peak .",

    "this means that the chiral @xmath1 interaction is attractive but not enough to generate a bound state in a single channel problem .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath158 interaction , which can solely generate a bound state as the origin of the @xmath22 resonance  @xcite .",
    "in addition , this fact implies that the multiple scatterings such as @xmath159 assist the @xmath1 interaction in dynamically generating a @xmath1 quasibound state which is located very close to the @xmath1 threshold . in the multiple scatterings",

    "the obtained scattering amplitude can qualitatively reproduce the experimental data of the @xmath112 and @xmath33 mass spectra and contains a @xmath96 pole as a @xmath1 molecule , which can be identified with the @xmath3 resonance . due to the small or vanishing couplings of the @xmath1 channel to others",

    "finally we suggest that further experimental studies on the @xmath13 resonance and related @xmath24 and @xmath1 mass spectra are most welcome , since these experiments can constrain more the @xmath1 scattering amplitude and the structure of the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "especially future studies on multi - strangeness systems at j - parc , jlab , and other facilities can shed light on the structure of the @xmath3 resonance .",

    ", we expect that we can utilize the same or a similar approach to the @xmath22 case , which has been extensively studied in the chiral unitary approach as well as in many other models , effective theories , and lattice qcd simulations .",
