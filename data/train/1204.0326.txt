    "<S> therefore , bak is an ideal system to study the doping evolution of sc gaps . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is important to investigate the significance of each orbital component to the unconventional pairing mechanism in bak and its doping evolution which will be a crucial test for the validity of available theories on iron pnictides . while arpes is the most direct experimental technique in probing the electronic structure of solids and addressing the above issues , there is still little consensus on the sc gaps of iron pnictides , including bak , determined from arpes . </S>",
