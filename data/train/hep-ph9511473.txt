    "the @xmath0-parity of a particle is @xmath9 , with value @xmath10 for particles and @xmath11 for sparticles .",
    "an important consequence of @xmath0-conservation is that the lightest sparticle is stable and is thus a candidate for cold dark matter .",
    "however , since @xmath0-conservation is not theoretically motivated by any known principle , the possibility of @xmath0-nonconservation deserves equally serious consideration .",
    "in addition to the yukawa superpotential in the mssm @xmath12 there are two classes of @xmath0-violating couplings in the mssm superpotential , allowed by supersymmetry and renormalizability  @xcite .",
    "the superpotential terms for the first class violate lepton number @xmath7 , @xmath13 while those of the second class violate baryon number @xmath6 , @xmath14 here @xmath15 stand for the doublet lepton , doublet quark , singlet antilepton , singlet @xmath16-type antiquark , singlet @xmath17-type antiquark superfields , respectively , and @xmath18 are generation indices .",
    "the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ supmssm ] ) are the yukawa coupling matrices . in our notation ,",
    "the superfields above are the weak interaction eigenstates , which might be expected as the natural choice at the grand unified scale , rather than the mass eigenstates .",
    "the yukawa couplings @xmath22 and @xmath23 are antisymmetric in their first two indices because of superfield antisymmetry .",
    "these superpotential terms lead to the interaction lagrangians @xmath24 for the @xmath25-terms , whereas the @xmath26-terms yield @xmath27 with corresponding terms for each of these generations . in the case of a @xmath6-violating superpotential",
    "the lagrangian reads @xmath28 to escape the proton - lifetime constraints , it is sufficient that only one of these classes be absent or very highly suppressed .",
    "phenomenological studies of the consequences of @xmath0-parity violation ( rpv ) have placed constraints on the various couplings @xmath29  @xcite , but considerable latitude remains for rpv .",
    "studies of the renormalization group evolution equations ( rge ) , relating couplings at the electroweak scale to their values at the grand unification ( gut ) scale , have led to new insights and constraints on the observable low - energy parameters in the @xmath0-conserving scenario .",
    "it therefore seems worthwhile to see what can be learned from similar studies of rpv scenarios .",
    "an initial study of this type addressed the evolution of @xmath30 and @xmath31 couplings  @xcite .",
    "this was subsequently extended to all the baryon - violating couplings @xmath32  @xcite . in the present work",
    "we undertake a somewhat more general study of the rge for rpv interactions , paying particular attention to solutions for which both the @xmath0-conserving and @xmath0-violating top quark yukawa couplings simultaneously approach infrared fixed points .",
    "such fixed - point behaviour requires a coupling @xmath33 , or @xmath34 to be of order unity at the electroweak scale .",
    "after our study was completed , a related work on rge for rpv couplings appeared  @xcite , which however has a different focus and is largely complementary to the present paper .    in the context of grand unified theories one",
    "is led to consider the possible unification of rpv parameters .",
    "if for example the rpv interactions arose from an su(5)-invariant term , then in fact the @xmath7-violating rpv couplings would be related to the @xmath6-violating ones  @xcite at the gut scale .",
    "we could then no longer set one or the other arbitrarily to zero and the proton lifetime ( which places very strong constraints on products of @xmath7-violating and @xmath6-violating rpv couplings , typically requiring products @xmath35 to be smaller than @xmath36  @xcite ) would strongly constrain all types of rpv couplings .",
    "it can be argued that some products of @xmath6-violating and @xmath7-violating couplings , containing several high - generation indices , would not contribute directly to proton decay  @xcite ; however , proton decay would still be induced at the one - loop level by flavor mixing  @xcite , so in fact all rpv couplings would have to be very small . in such scenarios the fixed - point solutions for rpv couplings would be excluded ; our present studies therefore implicitly assume that this kind of rpv unification does not occur . furthermore , since rpv unification is analogous to the popular hypothesis of @xmath37 yukawa unification , it would appear somewhat inconsistent ( though not completely unthinkable ) to assume one without the other .",
    "accordingly , in our present work , we do not try to impose the additional constraint of @xmath37 unification .",
    "for any trilinear term in the superpotential @xmath38 involving superfields @xmath39 , the evolution of the couplings @xmath40 with the scale @xmath41 is given by the rge @xmath42 where the @xmath43 are elements of the anomalous dimension matrix .",
    "table  i gives the anomalous dimensions for the superfields .",
    "the first column of the table gives the results for the mssm in matrix form ; here * u ,  d * and * e * are the matrices of yukawa couplings to the up - quarks , down - quarks and charged leptons , respectively , and a unit matrix is understood in front of the terms involving su(3 ) , su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge couplings @xmath44 and @xmath45 and the terms with traces .",
    "the second column of table  [ violating ] gives the additions to the anomalous dimension matrix due to @xmath7-violating terms @xmath22 and @xmath46 , while the third column gives the corresponding additions due to @xmath6-violating @xmath23 terms . in our notation ,",

    "some further radical simplifications in the rpv sector are clearly needed to make the system of equations tractable .",
    "it is plausible that there may exist a generational hierarchy among the rpv couplings , analogous to that of the conventional higgs couplings ; indeed , the rpv couplings to higher generations evolve more strongly due to larger higgs couplings in their rge , and hence have the potential to take larger values than rpv couplings to lower generations .",
    "thus we consider retaining only the couplings @xmath67 and @xmath68 , or @xmath31 , neglecting all others .",
    "this restriction is also motivated by the fact that the experimental upper limits are stronger for the couplings with lower indices .    to simplify the form of the rge",
    ", we adopt the following notation : @xmath69 the one - loop rge then take the following forms , where @xmath70 , @xmath71 here it is understood that one takes _ either _ @xmath72 _ or _ @xmath73 .",
    "an extremely interesting possibility in the rge is that @xmath74 is large at the gut scale and consequently is driven toward a fixed point at the electroweak scale  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the mssm @xmath75 as @xmath76 ; since @xmath77 , this leads to the relation , for low @xmath78  @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the ratio of the higgs vevs and @xmath81(pole ) is the mass at the @xmath82-propagator pole .",
    "it is interesting to examine the impact of rpv couplings on this fixed - point result  @xcite .",
    "we first review the @xmath84 fixed - point behavior in the mssm limit , where rpv couplings are neglected .",
    "setting @xmath85 at @xmath86 gives the fixed - point condition @xmath87 the @xmath84 and @xmath88 couplings at @xmath89 are related to the running masses @xmath90 with @xmath91  gev . here",
    "@xmath92 gives the qcd / qed running of @xmath93 between @xmath94 and @xmath89 ; @xmath95 for @xmath96  @xcite .",
    "thus we can express @xmath97 in terms of @xmath98 , @xmath78 and the known running masses : @xmath99 taking @xmath100  gev , @xmath101  gev , and hence @xmath102 for small or moderate values @xmath103 , we obtain @xmath104 so we can safely neglect the @xmath105 contribution .",
    "in this case , taking the approximate values @xmath106 we find the numerical value @xmath107 for large @xmath108 , we can express the @xmath84 fixed - point relation as @xmath109      next we consider the @xmath6-violating scenario with @xmath72 and @xmath111 non - zero , investigating the possibility that fixed - point limits are approached for both @xmath74 and @xmath111 couplings , as found numerically in ref .  @xcite ( note that these authors use a different definition of @xmath23 ) .",
    "this requires @xmath85 and @xmath112 at @xmath86 , giving the conditions @xmath113 taking linear combinations to solve for @xmath74 and @xmath111 we obtain ( with @xmath114 ) @xmath115 showing a considerable downward displacement in @xmath84 due to @xmath31 .",
    "such a large value of @xmath31 would imply substantial @xmath116 decay , if kinematically allowed .    if both @xmath84 and @xmath31 fixed points are realized as above",
    ", then the predicted physical top quark mass is @xmath117 even for moderate values of @xmath118 one has @xmath119 .",
    "this prediction is at the lower end of the present data  @xcite : @xmath120 when the data become more precise , the fixed - point possibility for @xmath31 could be excluded , if the measured central value of @xmath81 is unchanged .",
    "one can also consider the case of large @xmath121 where the coupling @xmath105 is non - negligible , and in fact may be near its own fixed point . in that case",

    "the latter would imply substantial @xmath136 decays , if kinematically allowed ; the @xmath137 mode is more likely , since @xmath138 is usually expected to be lighter than @xmath139 , and we discuss its implications later .",
    "if @xmath130 is negligible , @xmath74 and @xmath133 can approach fixed points simultaneously ; in this case the two conditions essentially decouple , giving the mssm result for @xmath74 .",

    "this has interesting implications for the prediction of fermion mixings at the electroweak scale from an ansatz for yukawa matrices at the gut scale . in a model such as the mssm ( or the sm ) with no rpv terms",

    "nevertheless the evolution of ckm angles differs from the mssm because the evolution of the yukawa couplings on the right hand side is altered by the rpv couplings .",

    "it can be seen that for all @xmath166 at the gut scale , the respective yukawa coupling approaches its fixed point at the electroweak scale .",

    "one might hope that rpv interactions could help to explain the measured value of @xmath172 , which differs from the sm prediction by over three standard deviations .",
    "however , while their contributions can have either sign , the rpv couplings must be significantly above their fixed - point values to explain the full discrepancy  @xcite . in the case of lepton rpv the bounds on the leptonic partial widths are always strong enough to prevent rpv couplings from taking such large values .",
    "next we address the question , whether rpv couplings will significantly change the relation between electroweak scale and gut scale values of the off - diagonal terms of the ckm matrix .",
    "when the masses and mixings of the ckm matrix satisfy a hierarchy , these relations are given by @xmath173 where @xmath174 is a ckm matrix element connecting the third generation to one of the lighter generations , and @xmath8 is a scaling factor  @xcite .",

    "<S> we study the evolution of @xmath0-parity - violating ( rpv ) couplings in the minimum supersymmetric standard model , between the electroweak and grand unification scales , assuming a family hierarchy for these coupling strengths . </S>",
    "<S> particular attention is given to solutions where both the @xmath0-conserving and @xmath0-violating top quark yukawa couplings simultaneously approach infrared fixed points ; these we analyse both algebraically and with numerical solutions of the evolution equations at one - loop level . </S>",
