    "the design of a controller for a linear system with input saturations is a challenging task .",
    "input saturation can have a disastrous effects @xcite . in general , it is common to consider control problem involving integral action and in the presence of input saturations , the state of the integrator can wind up and affect the response of the underlying system .",
    "engineers using pi and pid control have solved the windup problems using ad hoc measures , such as by resetting the integral states in the case of windup , or by using a modified digital implementation of the controller , which does not depend on the integral error terms . however , these ad hoc measures lack mathematical rigor and are mostly heuristic @xcite .",
    "attempts have also been made by control system designers to penalize the control output so that actuator limits would never be violated .",
    "these method are useful to some extent but may result in a design which is too conservative and unable to utilize the full capability of the available control authority .    in order to use full controller authority of the controller and to recover the nominal performance of the system in the event of actuator saturation ,",
    "considerable attention has been given to antiwindup augmentation over the last decades .",
    "the main advantage of using an antiwindup augmentation scheme is that the system will operate with its full capability in term of robustness and performance in the absence of input saturation .",
    "the antiwindup correction only come into effect in an event of input saturation .",
    "antiwindup augmentation , as the name suggests , is a two - stage design procedure . in this design procedure ,",
    "the requirement of small signal behavior of the nominal system is guaranteed by ignoring the saturation . then antiwindup compensation",
    "is added to recover the nominal performance in the presence of saturation .    noting the importance of the antiwindup augmentation to handle saturation , different methods have been appeared in the literature over the decades .",
    "most of the methods relying on the @xmath0 optimal control approach have considered the antiwindup problem as an @xmath1 gain minimization problem @xcite . in these papers , saturation nonlinearities",
    "are considered as a sector or dead - zone type nonlinearities and the antiwindup problem is solved by formulating it in a convex optimal framework . in @xcite , linear fractional transformation ( lft ) and linear parameter varying ( lpv ) approaches have been proposed for parameter - varying saturated systems . all of these methods employs linear matrix inequalities ( lmis ) as a tool to compute global optima in a simplified way .",
    "the main drawback of the lmi framework is that in several situations lmi constraints are unfeasible and hence no solution exists .",
    "also , lmi methods can suffer from numerical and computational problems in the case of high order system .",
    "these problems are solved to some extent in @xcite by characterizing the antiwindup problem in terms of a nonconvex feasibility problem , which reduces to a convex feasibility problem when a certain rank constraint becomes inactive .",
    "another solution of this problem is attempted in @xcite where , the non - feasible problem was solved based on the approximate solution of an lmi .",
    "the results of @xcite are only applicable to linear stable plants .",
    "antiwindup controller design for an unstable system was considered in @xcite which is also based on the lmi method .",
    "however , the results are only valid when no uncertainty exists in the original system except for the uncertainty due to the actuator saturation .    in this paper we have considered stabilizable unstable linear systems subject to parameter uncertainties and input saturations .",
    "the formulation of the antiwindup problem is based on an @xmath0 framework . in this framework a dynamic antiwindup compensator is proposed , which solves a risk - sensitive control problem using the minimax lqg ( a robust version of lqg control ) design method @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the @xmath1 gain optimization problem .",
    "the only difference is that in minimax approach , we minimize the upper bound on a time averaged cost function and guarantee the robust performance .",
    "this method not only allows for the uncertainty which arises from saturation nonlinearities but also accounts for uncertainties present in the original system . in the propose method ,",
    "a suitable robust controller is obtained by ignoring actuator saturation and then the closed loop system is augmented by a robust antiwindup compensator .",
    "the proposed antiwindup controller is then applied to solve the actuator saturation problem in an air - breathing hypersonic flight vehicle .",
    "the control problem in this example poses significant challenges as it offers a challenging trade - off among conflicting requirements . in high speed aircraft ,",
    "the model is subject to parameter uncertainties due to a large flight envelop and a good robust controller is required to be designed .",
    "however , in the absence of antiwindup augmentation , limited control authority seldom allows the robust controller to work in its full capacity and thus degradation in the performance is unavoidable .",
    "the antiwindup compensator proposed in this paper solves these problems quite effectively and can be easily implemented on - board the aircraft .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system ] describes the class of uncertain linear systems and uncertainties considered in the paper .",
    "section [ sec : awproblem ] describes the general antiwindup problem and the synthesis of an antiwindup compensator using the minimax lqg method .",
    "the application of the proposed method to an ahfv control problem along with simulation results are presented in section [ sec : example ] .",
    "the paper is concluded in section [ sec : concl ] , with some final remarks on the proposed procedure .",
    "consider an unconstrained uncertain linear unstable plant given by    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the plant state , @xmath4 is the control input , @xmath5 is the uncertainty input , @xmath6 is the uncertainty output , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the matrices of suitable dimensions .",

    "then for any @xmath24, ... ,@xmath25 such that riccati equation ( [ eqare ] ) has a positive definite solution , the controller ( [ eqcontrollaw ] ) is a guaranteed cost controller for this uncertain system with any initial condition @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore the corresponding value of the cost function ( [ eqfcost ] ) is bounded by the quantity ( [ eqfbond ] ) for all admissible uncertainties and moreover , the closed loop system is absolutely stable .     * _ proof : _ * see @xcite . @xmath33",
    "in real control problem , the input @xmath34 is subject to saturation and thus the control law ( [ eqcontrollaw ] ) may not give satisfactory performance . indeed ,",
    "each component @xmath35 of the input vector @xmath36 is subject to a saturation nonlinearity of the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : usat ] .",
    "the antiwindup problem here is to design a suitable antiwindup compensator which guarantees adequate performance of the closed loop system in the presence of saturation nonlinearity .",

    "the design of an antiwindup augmentation system for the uncertain linear system is designed by defining a new equivalent uncertain model , considering the saturation nonlinearities as sector bounded uncertainties ( deadzone type ) and then froming an equivalent closed loop system using ( [ eqcontrollawnew ] ) .",
