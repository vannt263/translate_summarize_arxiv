    "the diagrams contributing to the self - energy are such that the connected pieces in the bulk involves only bulk propagators , because bulk loops and bulk vertices are suppressed . still one can integrate out the bulk degrees of freedom only perturbatively in our generic model .",

    "we can approximate in the denominator @xmath128 , then the @xmath129 integral can be immediately performed , since @xmath130 and we find @xmath131 the final @xmath132 integral can again be done by residues : @xmath133 in summary , the polarization vanishes for @xmath126 , and it has the same form as in the fermi liquid for @xmath127 .",
    "we can readily do the @xmath137 integral by taking the pole contribution .",
    "we obtain @xmath138 in the last step we have used the fact that the logarithmic integral is automatically regulated in the manner shown if the damping is introduced in a self - consistent manner @xcite .",
    "remarkably the self - energy corrections are very much like a fermi liquid and subleading at the fermi surface .",
    "these results are compatible with the intuition one can develop from renormalization group arguments .",
    "thus one can argue that even higher order perturbative corrections will be subleading at the fermi surface .",
    "a problem one encounters wen trying to couple a fermi liquid to a critical boson @xcite is that the fermion polarization will renormalize the boson propagator ( diagram f in fig .",

    "the situation is actually better .",
    "even though diagram f is not suppressed in the @xmath10-counting , the effect is a correction @xmath139 to a bare term of order @xmath140 , so it does not destabilize the fixed point for @xmath141 , at least by a naive application of the rg argument . however it would be important to confirm this intuition by careful computations .      in this section",

    "this propagator is characterized by the property of having poles in the lower half - plane ( lhp ) of complex frequencies for @xmath168 and in the upper half - plane ( uhp ) for @xmath169 ; moreover , it is equal to @xmath170 for @xmath171 and to @xmath172 for @xmath173 .",
    "+ when we consider the product of two green s functions , @xmath174 , and we perform the integral over @xmath28 on a contour that includes the real axis and the circle going to infinity in the uhp , there are four possibilities :        let us now consider the case of the non - fermi liquid .",
    "the retarded green s function has the form @xmath183 where @xmath184 and we consider the charged case , so we explictly included the phase factor in the self - energy , so in this section @xmath185 .",

    "by analogy with the free case , we find that the right prescription is obtained with the following form : @xmath187 to perform the integral , we map @xmath188 .",
    "this maps the uhp into a wedge of angle @xmath189 .",
    "the integral is along the edges of the wedge and the contour at infinity that does not cross the branch cut .",

    "we review the derivation of the landau - silin equations generalized to our system .",
    "let us begin with the case of uncharged fermi liquid where long range forces are absent .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation written explicitly is as below :        it is easy to see that the transfer of energy - momentum @xmath100 from one fermionic pair to another is merely a spectator in the integral equation",

    "we recall @xmath26 is just a number related to the residue of the pole of the @xmath20 propagator at the fermi - surface in @xmath140 .",
    "the matrix multiplication can then be obviously defined .    in the matrix language , the spatial fourier transform of the wigner function representing phase space density operator of fermions given by @xmath204 ,",
    "can be thought of as a vector .",

    "<S> we can then derive the phenomenological consequences of these formulas . </S>",
    "<S> in the case of a neutral liquid , @xmath81 . then the equation for the zero sound has a solution if the integral operator schematically given by @xmath82 has an eigenvalue equal to 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this can happen , for a given @xmath70 , only for certain values of @xmath83 ; each such value corresponds to a collective mode . </S>",
    "<S> assuming for simplicity that @xmath68 has only a monopole part @xmath84 , we find a solution for the zero sound with a dispersion relation @xmath85 with velocity @xmath86 determined by the equation @xmath87 for @xmath60 non - fermi liquids . </S>",
    "<S> notice that only filled states below the fermi surface contribute to the integral ; therefore , there is a natural cutoff @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> the solution is in general complex , so we predict that the zero mode will be present as a peak in the response function but it will be rather damped ; moreover its dependence on the cutoff shows that it is not a collective excitation only of modes close to the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> some universal feature can be obtained in the limit of large @xmath84 : the equation shows that @xmath89 , up to real cutoff - dependent prefactors . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the velocity and attenuation is then independent of the cutoff in this limit , and the width of the zero sound , to the extent that it can be defined , is related to the lifetime of the quasiparticles .    in the charged liquid , with a coulomb interaction @xmath90 , as usual , the zero sound becomes gapped and there is a plasma frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be obtained by replacing @xmath86 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ zerosound ] ) by @xmath91 and @xmath84 by the coulomb potential , while expanding in @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma frequency @xmath93 is then found to be : @xmath94 in @xmath60 non - fermi liquids . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this is generically complex with the ratio of the real to imaginary parts again independent of the cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> the nonvanishing imaginary part of the plasma frequency denotes that the medium does not act as a sharp filter for the lower frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to explore further the optical properties of our systems by computing the dielectric constant and the refractive index , along the lines of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in the other cases of @xmath95 and @xmath6/lifshitz , the structure of the singular function is similar to that of a fermi liquid </S>",
    "<S> . however , in the charged case , the collective mode will be radically different if the bulk @xmath96 exchange gives a force which goes like @xmath97 , with @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma frequency will then behave like @xmath99 for small @xmath100 , which means that even high frequency modes will be damped unlike in charged fermi liquid . </S>",
    "<S> even though we can not trust the analysis for large @xmath83 , this indicates a different behavior than the fermi liquid .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion _ we have shown the differences from the predictions of landau theory that arise in the semiholographic fermion models at the level of collective excitations . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to see whether the large separation of the zero sound pole from the continuum of two - particle excitations , that is a feature of landau fermi liquid theory for large values of @xmath84 , is generically true in the class of models we consider . </S>",
    "<S> more generally the response of the system to external perturbations needs to be understood in more detail .    </S>",
    "<S> there are a number of directions in which our work can be extended using similar techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we plan to compute the thermodynamics and transport properties of the system , as well as studying the system at finite temperature , and the onset of the superconducting instability generalizing bcs theory ( see e.g. ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    we should also study the interplay between the collective excitations and quantum kinetics of semiholographic fermions with the hydrodynamic and relaxational modes of the cft degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> this can be pursued using methods developed for computing holographic nonequilibrium spectral and statistical functions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for another line of development , it is possible to add chern - simons - like term for gauge fields in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> these naturally reproduce global anomalies for the holographically dual cft . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us a concrete method of introducing chiral anomalies in this class of models .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it should be possible to apply our approach to the more general class of hyperscaling violating bulk geometries @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these infrared geometries can be characterized by the dynamical critical exponent @xmath101 and hyperscaling violating exponent @xmath102 .    </S>",
