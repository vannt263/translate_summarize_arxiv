    "starlight produced by the first galaxies is the leading candidate for ionizing the hydrogen as well as singly ionizing the helium at @xmath10 .",
    "it takes a harder source of radiation to doubly ionize the helium , so the reionization of this species is likely deferred until @xmath11 when quasars produce a sufficient hard uv background @xcite .",
    "however , the helium could have been doubly ionized at nearly the same cosmic time that hydrogen was reionized if more exotic sources ionized the hydrogen , such as the first generation of metal - free stars @xcite or miniquasars @xcite . in a third potential scenario ,",
    "early sources doubly ionized the helium and then shut off .",
    "afterward , the he  ii  recombined such that quasars could again reionize it at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "if he  ii  reionization were completing at @xmath12 , an epoch for which there are numerous observations of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , it should be an easier task to definitively detect this process compared to detecting @xmath13 reionization processes .",
    "furthermore , if he  ii  reionization were ending at @xmath12 , it should have significantly affected the temperature of the intergalactic gas and the ultraviolet radiation background .",
    "these motivations , along with recent additions to the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , have inspired a significant effort of late to understand the signatures and the detection prospects of he  ii  reionization @xcite .",
    "three separate observations of the @xmath11 igm suggest that he  ii  reionization was ending around this redshift : first , several studies have measured the temperature of the intergalactic gas from the widths of the narrowest lines in the h  i  ly@xmath1 forest , and the majority of these studies have found evidence for an increase in the igm temperature of @xmath14  k between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , before a decline to lower redshift @xcite .",
    "these trends have been attributed to the heating from he  ii  reionization .",
    "second , observations of he  ii  ly@xmath1 absorption from gas at @xmath17 show tens of comoving mpc ( cmpc ) regions with no detected transmission @xcite , which may indicate that he  ii  reionization was not complete .",
    "thirdly , @xcite and @xcite detected evolution in the column density ratios of certain highly ionized metals at @xmath16 , which they argued was due to a hardening in the ionizing background around @xmath18ev and , thus , the end of he  ii  reionization .",
    "however , the interpretations of all of these indications for he  ii  reionization are controversial .",
    "temperature measurements of the igm are difficult , and not all measurements detected the aforementioned trends .",
    "it is often argued that he  ii  ly@xmath1 absorption saturates at he  ii  fractions that are too small ( @xmath19 at the mean density ) to study he  ii  reionization ( although , see @xcite ) .",
    "lastly , inferences from metal lines require significant modeling , and studies have reached different conclusions regarding the degree of their evolution at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this paper discusses intergalactic absorption by the @xmath20  transitions of he  i  as an unsaturated observable of he  ii  reionization .",
    "we primarily focus on the strongest and longest wavelength of these absorption lines , the he  i  @xmath21 , @xmath0  line . for a given optical depth in the h  i  ly@xmath1 forest , the amount of absorption in the he  i",
    "forest can be directly estimated if both the fraction of helium that is he  ii  and the ratio of the h  i  and he  i  photoionization rates are known .",
    "in addition , because the he  i  ionization edge is relatively close to that of hydrogen , the photoionization rate that he  i  experiences is similar to this for hydrogen .",
    "thus , the most important determinant of the amount of he  i  @xmath22    absorption is the he  ii  fraction .",
    "other studies have discussed the he  i  forest , but did not focus on its usefulness as a probe of helium reionization .",
    "@xcite was the first to discuss intergalactic absorption by the he  i  @xmath0 , and this study attempted unsuccessfully to detect this absorption in the spectrum of a @xmath23 quasar .",
    "@xcite targeted he  i  absorption from @xmath24 h  i  lyman - limit systems , and reported the first ( and at present only ) detection of intergalactic he  i  @xmath0  absorption .",
    "finally , @xcite showed that the he  i  forest could be a useful probe of the hardness of the ultraviolet background , and they focused on using this absorption to rule out a particular nonstandard model for the dark matter .",
    "@xcite followed up on this idea , arguing that the @xmath25 he  i  forest could be a useful diagnostic of the hardness of the ultraviolet background after hydrogen reionization .",
    "as with the he  ii  ly@xmath1 transition at @xmath26 , the he  i  @xmath0  transition falls blueward of the hydrogen lyman limit and , therefore , is subject to continuum absorption by hydrogen , in this case from h  i  systems with @xmath27 .",
    "this continuum absorption may even be worse in terms of obscuring the he  i  @xmath0  forest compared to the he  ii  ly@xmath1 forest because this spectral region is more affected by higher redshift h  i  continuum absorbers .",
    "it is unlikely that there are more than a handful of quasar sightlines at @xmath28 with sufficient near ultraviolet ( nuv ) flux for detection with the present generation of instruments ( and almost certainly not at @xmath29 , during he  i  reionization ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , our focus is on applications of he  i  absorption at @xmath30 .",
    "we have performed a cursory search for candidate he  i  sightlines among the relatively few published heii lya forest spectra that extend redward to @xmath31 . of note , qso  oq  172 ( @xmath32 )",
    "has @xmath33erg  s@xmath34  @xmath35  @xmath34 at @xmath36  @xcite , and qso  0055 - 269 ( @xmath37 ) has @xmath38 ( gabor worseck , priv . com . ) .",
    "in fact , we were surprised to find that most he  ii  sightlines in our search had significant flux in the relevant band .",
    "many of the existing he  ii  sightlines had been selected by their far ultraviolet flux .",
    "nuv selection would be more optimal for identifying candidate he  i  forest sightlines .",
    "for example , hs  1140  + 3508 ( @xmath39 ) is obscured in the far ultraviolet by a lyman - limit system , but has a nuv flux of @xmath40 ( gabor worseck , priv .",
    "com . ) .",
    "another difficulty with the he  i  forest is that line absorption from foreground systems can contaminate the he  i  forest , the most important of which is h  i  ly@xmath1 absorption .",
    "h  i  ly@xmath1 absorption from a system with a redshift of @xmath41 falls directly on top of the he  i  absorption from a redshift of @xmath42 .",
    "fortunately , the ly@xmath1 forest is quite thin at relevant @xmath43 ( with a flux decrement of several percent ) , and we find that both this contaminant s mean transmission and variance tend to be comparable to that of the he  i  forest . also , the he  i  forest correlates strongly with the coeval h  i  ly@xmath1 forest , which allows it to be extracted in cross correlation despite this contamination .",
    "this study is timely because the hst reservicing mission installed the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) in may 2009 .",
    "cos is capable of measurements of hei @xmath0  absorption at redshifts relevant to he  ii  reionization ( @xmath44 ) , and ground - based spectrographs can cover higher redshifts ( @xmath45 , corresponding to @xmath46   ) .",
    "cos is able to achieve higher signal - to - noise ratios than previous instruments in the ultraviolet .",
    "a @xmath47hr exposure with cos would achieve a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath48 at @xmath49 for a flux of @xmath50erg  s@xmath34  @xmath35  @xmath34 ( the flux of qso  oq  172 and hs  1140  + 3508 ) at @xmath51  ( he  i  absorption from @xmath52 ) . a @xmath53hr exposure with cos",
    "would achieve a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath48 for this flux at @xmath54 at @xmath55  ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "times higher than specifications ( and than what is assumed by this etc ) , and , thus , a significantly longer observation is required unless this issue is resolved . ]",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "section  [ sec : calculations ] contrasts simulated spectra for this forest under different assumptions regarding the ionization state of the helium .",
    "section  [ sec : tests ] quantifies the spectral quality an observation must achieve to verify whether he  ii  reionization was occurring from the he  i  forest .",
    "appendix  [ sec : hardness ] outlines how to measure the hardness of the ionizing background with he  i  absorption , and appendix  [ ap : snrcc ] derives formulae for the significance with which he  i  absorption can be detected in cross correlation with the coeval ly@xmath1 forest .",
    "this paper assumes a flat @xmath57cdm cosmology with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , consistent with recent measurements @xcite . however , the simulation used to calculate the ly@xmath1 forest spectra at @xmath64 , the d5 simulation in @xcite , assumes a slightly different cosmology , with the most notable differences being @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the photoionization and recombination rates used in this study are from @xcite .",
    "in photoionization equilibrium , the he  i  fraction is determined by the relation @xmath67 photoionization equilibrium is a good approximation because the timescale to reach equilibrium ( @xmath68  yr at @xmath11 ; e.g. , @xcite ) was much shorter than all other relevant timescales . here ,",

    ". we will sometimes imprecisely write @xmath78 for a gas parcel even though a small fraction ( @xmath79 ) of the helium is in @xmath80 .",
    "if the density and @xmath81 are known ( since @xmath82 is effectively known in the igm after hydrogen reionization up to density ) , a measurement of @xmath80 can be used to determine @xmath3 ( equation  [ eqn : xhei ] ) .",
    "fortunately , coeval h  i  lyman - series absorption provides an estimate for the density of a he  i  absorber .",
    "in addition , the he  i  photoionization rate ( like this for the h  i ) is expected to have been essentially spatially independent owing to the long mean free path of he  i - ionizing photons ( @xmath83 ) and the large number of sources in a volume of @xmath84 .",
    "it is estimated that @xmath85cmpc at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath81 was effectively just a single number in all of the igm .",
    "this paper focuses primarily on the longest wavelength allowed ground - state transition for he  i , the @xmath21 , @xmath0  transition .",
    "its oscillator strength is @xmath86 times larger than the next strongest transition of he  i , the @xmath87 , @xmath88  transition . he  i  @xmath0  absorption is observable in a suitable quasar absorption spectrum between the wavelengths of @xmath31  and @xmath89 , where the he  ii  ly@xmath1 forest begins .",
    "this wavelength range corresponds to he  i  absorption from @xmath90.  ( the redshifted he  i  limit ) , but these discontinuities should be minimal ( @xmath91 ) for sightlines selected against having strong h  i  continuum absorption . ]    to redshift across the @xmath0  transition , a photon experienced the optical depth from gas in the hubble flow of @xmath92 ( what is termed the he  i  gunn - peterson optical depth ; @xcite ) where @xmath93 is the h  i  ly@xmath1 gunn - peterson optical depth , @xmath94 is the gas density in units of the cosmic mean , @xmath95 is the temperature in units of @xmath96k , and the @xmath97 exponent owes to the temperature dependence of the recombination coefficient ( cf . equation  [ eqn : xhei ] ) .",

    "this choice is motivated by ultraviolet background models , which find @xmath110 at @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath108 and @xmath81 in ultraviolet background models requires two inputs : ( 1 ) a model for the source emissivity at frequencies near the ionization potential for h  i  and he  i , and ( 2 ) the measured h  i  column density distribution , which determines the attenuation by h  i  continuum absorption .",
    "the @xcite model predicts @xmath112 at @xmath113 .",
    "this model assumes that both stars and quasars contributed to the metagalactic ultraviolet output , with an increasingly important stellar contribution with redshift at @xmath114 .",
    "this model uses the result of the stellar population synthesis code pegase for the spectral index of starlight between the he  i  and he  ii  ionization edges .",
    "this code yields a similar value for stars ( @xmath115 , defined as the power - law slope of the specific intensity ; @xcite ) to what is expected for quasars ( @xmath116 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these similar @xmath1 result in the near constancy of @xmath117 in the @xcite model .",
    "given these input @xmath1 , h  i  continuum absorption then resulted in the spectral index of the average radiation background being hardened above @xmath118ev by roughly @xmath119 over the input @xmath1 for @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the power - law index of the h  i  column - density distribution .",
    "the background model of @xcite assumes @xmath122 , resulting in a hardening of @xmath123 .",
    "however , there is modeling uncertainty in the input @xmath1 for stars that stems from uncertainty in the spectrum of wolf - rayet stars @xcite , in the average stellar metallicity , and in the stellar initial mass function .",
    "if the spectral index of stars were significantly softer , the ratio @xmath124 would be smaller than in the fiducial model in @xcite . in the extreme example that the stellar contribution dominated the ionizing background and had a spectral index of @xmath125 instead of @xmath126 , @xmath81 would have been reduced relative to @xmath108 by a factor of @xmath127 .",
    "this boosts @xmath128 by a factor of @xmath129 .",
    "in addition , there is uncertainty in @xmath121 at the @xmath130-level @xcite that affects @xmath124 at the factor of two - level .",
    "previous calculations of the ionizing background included only h  i  continuum absorption to calculate ( given a source emissivity model ) the ionizing background between @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "these models ignored he  i  continuum absorption .",
    "this approximation may have affected their estimate for @xmath81 because the he  i  continuum absorption above @xmath133 is comparable to that of h  i  for optically thin systems .",
    "namely , for gas of primordial composition in photoionization equilibrium @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the continuum absorption of ion @xmath73 at energy @xmath136",

    "these systems were much more self - shielded to h  i  lyman - limit photons than to those at the the he  i  ionization edge .",
    "thus , the effective value of @xmath140 in equation  ( [ eqn : continuum ] ) was much lower in these dense absorbers , resulting in h  i  continuum absorption dominating over that of he  i  at @xmath137 .",
    "we estimate in calculations not included that the break at @xmath133 owing to he  i  continuum absorption in the spatially - averaged uv background at @xmath11 amounted to only a couple percent .",
    "this justifies our use of a background model that does not include he  i  continuum absorption .",
    "figures  [ fig : heiforest_z4 ]  and  [ fig : heiforest_z3 ] show calculations of the he  i  forest at @xmath141 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "these calculations use a randomly selected skewer of length @xmath142cmpc ( @xmath143 ) through the @xmath144cmpc/@xmath145 , @xmath146 particle sph simulation described in @xcite . the d5 simulation in @xcite is also used for calculating the low - z ly@xmath1 contamination .",

    "the leftmost assumes that the he  ii  fraction is given by @xmath150 everywhere , the middle that the helium is mostly he  iii  and that the fraction in he  ii  versus he  iii  is determined by a weak he  ii - ionizing background with @xmath151s@xmath34 , and the rightmost assumes an even weaker background with @xmath152s@xmath34 .",
    "the value @xmath151s@xmath34 is approximately the upper bound that has been set from observations of the most opaque regions in the he  ii  ly@xmath1 forest at @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "our scheme attenuates the ionizing background ( half of which is assumed to enter from each side ) based on the amount and distribution of he  ii .",

    "furthermore , the h  i  lyman forest provides a measure of the density of an absorber , which allows one to target low density gas parcels .",
    "we showed in section  [ sec : calculations ] that the amount of he  i  absorption in regions with @xmath205 ( which roughly correspond to regions with @xmath155 ) is drastically different between such models .",
    "if absorption from low density gas were detected , it would need to be proven that it is not due to a low - z interloper in order to claim a detection of a large - scale he  ii  region .",
    "this section discusses two methods to establish that he  ii  reionization was occurring at @xmath11 : ( 1 ) a direct method that involves identifying individual weak he  i  lines , and ( 2 ) a statistical method that uses the cross correlation with the ly@xmath1 forest to detect the he  i  absorption . unlike the former method",
    ", the latter method can be performed even when the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) on individual he  i  lines is much less than unity .",
    "with a high enough snr per resolution element , it may be possible to directly detect individual he  i  absorbers as was done in @xcite ( there , for relatively dense systems ) .",
    "once a candidate absorber is identified , it then needs to be ruled out that the absorption is not from a foreground interloper . to detect he  ii  gas from regions near the cosmic mean density requires targeting he  i  absorbers with @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "here is an example of how direct identification might be performed : for wavelengths that correspond to he  i  absorption at @xmath11 , we count @xmath208 h  i  ly@xmath1 systems in @xmath6  km  s@xmath34 of spectrum with a maximum flux decrement between @xmath209 and @xmath48 percent . the probability that one of these systems falls within @xmath210  km  s@xmath34 of a single he  i  absorber with the same decrement is @xmath211 and of @xmath102 he  i  absorbers is @xmath212 .",
    "thus , by targeting he  i  absorption from coeval h  i  systems , one can rule out chance contamination from foreground ly@xmath1 once a few systems are detected .",
    "an alternative method for direct identification would be to find a second he  i  line ( such as the @xmath88  line ) from the same absorption system .",
    "however , because the absorption in other he  i  lines will be at least several times weaker , it will be difficult to detect a second line from systems near the cosmic mean density ( requiring snr  @xmath104 per spectral pixel ) .",
    "it is most likely that the snr per resolution element will not be high enough to directly identify he  i  lines in regions with @xmath213 with present instruments .",
    "since @xmath214 , with @xmath215 and potentially more structure in @xmath216 than in @xmath3 , a measurement of @xmath216 may be used to construct a model for the he  i  signal that can be used to extract it in cross correlation . in what follows , we denote the he  i  transmission field as @xmath217 , where @xmath160 labels the spectral pixel .",
    "furthermore , we assume @xmath218 and @xmath219 to estimate the he  i  transmission from @xmath216 .",
    "thus , our estimate for the he  i  transmission in a pixel is @xmath220 ( cf . equations  [ eqn:584gp2 ]  and  [ eqn : taunhi ] ) .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath221 , the snr of the cross correlation is not affected by what we assume for the proportionality between @xmath128 and @xmath216 .",
    "in fact , we find that it is only marginally sensitive to this proportionality in realistic cases because the he  i  absorption is weak and because the snr in cross correlation depends more on the phase of modes than on their amplitude .",
    "we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sssec : imperfecttemplate ] how an imperfect estimate for @xmath222 affects our estimates .",
    "an estimator for detecting this signal in cross correlation is @xmath223 where @xmath224 represents the data , tildes denote a quantity in fourier space ( a convenient basis because the covariance matrix of the noise is diagonal ) , @xmath225 is the power spectrum of the foreground h  i  absorption , and @xmath226 is the power spectrum of the instrumental noise ( which we assume is white ) . conveniently , the variance on this estimator owing to noise is its average , making it an estimate for the square of the snr .",
    "this estimator is unbiased in the sense that components that do not correlate with @xmath227 do not contribute .",
    "this estimator assumes that the signal is known since it requires @xmath228 as input . in practice , this assumption can be avoided because for interesting cases we find that @xmath229 ( and the normalization factor can be determined in a measurement to fractional precision @xmath230snr@xmath34 ) .",
    "the ensemble average of this estimator over the noise and foreground absorption yields @xmath231 the cross correlation coefficient @xmath232 is bounded such that @xmath233 and is defined as @xmath234    the approximate equality given by equation ( [ eqn : stonapprox ] ) is a rough estimate for the snr of detection if @xmath235 and if the information is coming from modes near the resolution limit ( which roughly holds for @xmath236 ) . in this equality , @xmath237 is the number of resolution elements , and @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 are respectively the variance of the he  i  @xmath0  transmission ( normalized such that @xmath241 is transmission of unity ) , the foreground h  i  transmission , and the instrumental noise in a resolution element .",
    "this approximate relation shows that , for @xmath242 and @xmath243 ( @xmath244 ) , such a cross correlation can be used to detect the signal even if the fluctuations in the signal are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the fluctuations in the noise._{ij } \\ , { { \\cal t}}_{\\rm hei , j}^{\\rm est}$ ] and @xmath245 is the covariance matrix of the noise ( composed of both the instrumental noise and low - z ly@xmath1 absorption ) . for @xmath246",

    "figure  [ fig : matched ] plots the expected average snr as a function of @xmath248 at which the he  i  absorption can be detected in cross correlation , assuming @xmath243 and @xmath242 . to calculate this quantity , we substitute terms of the form @xmath249 with their ensemble - average in equation ( [ eqn : ston ] ) .",
    "the red curves are this snr for observations of he  i  absorption at @xmath105 ( thin ) and @xmath106 ( thick ) .",

    "for the calculations in figure  [ fig : matched ] , wavevectors only up to the nyquist cutoff for the spectrograph resolution are included ( @xmath256 ) , with this cutoff imposed using a tophat filter in @xmath257-space .",
    "spectrographs typically sample the signal @xmath258 to wavevectors that are a few times higher than @xmath259 to avoid aliasing ( i.e. , @xmath260 ) , where @xmath261 is the integer number of the spectral pixel , @xmath262 is the incident flux , and @xmath263 is the detector window function that damps wavevectors above @xmath264 .",
    "for realistic @xmath248 and @xmath265 , most contributions to the he  i  snr of detection are coming from @xmath257-modes a couple times smaller than the nyquist wavevector ( from wavevectors where @xmath266 ) , such that our results are somewhat robust to the exact details of the spectrograph . this can be noted in figure  [ fig : pk ] , which features the power spectrum of the different components of the signal .",

    "the foreground ly@xmath1 power spectrum ( dashed green curve ) intersects the noise power for @xmath268 and @xmath269 ( dotted black diagonal lines ) prior to the nyquist cutoff .",
    "this point of intersection also shows that both the instrumental noise and the noise from foreground absorption are of comparable importance in determining the snr .",
    "interestingly , because of the different thermal broadening scales , the he  i  absorption has significantly more power than the foreground absorption at @xmath270s  km@xmath34 ( cyan dot - dashed curve , fig .",

    "this difference increases the detectability of the he  i  absorption in @xmath265 spectra .",

    "we have calculated the probability distribution of the estimated snr from mock observations constructed from our simulations . in practice",
    "we find that the probability distribution is relatively gaussian even for @xmath271  cmpc skewers .      to isolate the he  i  absorption from low density gas , we mask pixels in the simulated he  i  forest with coeval ly@xmath1 absorption of @xmath186 .",
    "this mask covers @xmath211 of the pixels at @xmath105 and @xmath272 at @xmath106 .",

    "in addition , a simplified analysis that applies the cross - correlation statistic ( eqn .  [ eqn : estimator ] ) to just the intervals between masked regions , and sums the snr@xmath276 from each of these intervals , would likely provide a reasonable estimate for the snr of detection .    for the mask with @xmath186 , the standard deviation of the he  i  absorption",

    "this value @xmath279 may be achievable with cos on several existing sightlines , as discussed in the introduction .",

    "( see the thin green dashed curves in fig .",

    "this effect was included in all our calculations , but we find it has a negligible effect on the snr for detection of the cross correlation ( @xmath91 ) . to the extent the igm had a single temperature , the effect of thermal broadening is a convolution in wavelength space with a single gaussian filter . in this single - temperature limit ,",
    "the filters divide out and do not affect the value of @xmath293 and , therefore , the snr of detection .",
    "another complication arises because the measurement of @xmath216 will never be perfect .",
    "there will be noise in the estimate for this field that reduces @xmath293 further . to test the importance of an imperfect reconstruction of @xmath216",
    ", we have added noise to @xmath216 with the standard deviation in the noise per pixel of @xmath295 .",
    "we find a negligible difference in the snr of detection for @xmath296 for the case with the @xmath186 mask , which indicates that noise in the reconstruction of @xmath216 does not significantly degrade the measurement .- level in the nuv spectrum can have a substantial effect on the snr at which the he  i  absorption is detected .",
    "the reason that a similar level of noise is less important in the h  i  spectrum is because @xmath297 for most pixels at these redshifts , which translates into a @xmath298 error on @xmath216 if @xmath299 , except in the low optical depth pixels ( where there is little he  i  signal anyway ) and the high ones .",
    "whereas for he  i  absorption , if @xmath300 , we have order unity uncertainty in this optical depth for typical @xmath128 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath293 ( and thus the snr of detection ) is most sensitive to the phase of modes , which is largely maintained even when significant noise is added to the high-@xmath216 pixels . ]",
    "the he  i  absorption signal can also differ from the estimate for this signal from @xmath216 because of the patchy structure of he  ii  reionization .",
    "the signal in the cross correlation is coming from @xmath301cmpc@xmath34 , whereas the structure in the he  ii  fraction is thought to be modulated at scales of @xmath302  cmpc , the size of the he  iii  bubbles around quasars @xcite .",
    "the wavevectors affected by the structure of he  ii  reionization @xmath303 will be more than an order of magnitude smaller than those that contribute to the snr . if heii reionization is perfectly patchy such that the helium is either singly ionized or doubly ionized and a skewer of length @xmath304 is measured , then @xmath305 at @xmath306 , where @xmath307 is the volume - averaged he  ii  fraction . therefore , the total snr of the cross correlation is reduced on average by the factor @xmath307 . also note that in the contrasting toy case that he  ii  reionization was perfectly homogeneous , the snr is also reduced by @xmath307 .",
    "a detection of he  i  absorption from low density gas would translate to a @xmath308 error on @xmath307 of @xmath309 , where @xmath310 is the expected @xmath307 for a given estimated snr of detection in cross correlation with @xmath311 .",
    "thus , a @xmath312 detection from low density gas would yield a @xmath272 constraint ( ignoring uncertainty in @xmath81 ) .",
    "this constraint assumes that the low density gas during he  ii  reionization was composed of large - scale regions in which the helium was either he  ii  or he  iii , which is expected theoretically and is what is seen in simulations @xcite .",
    "this paper discussed the usefulness of the he  i  @xmath0  forest to study he  ii  reionization at @xmath313 .",
    "the optical depth of the he  i  @xmath0  line is proportional to the optical depth in h  i  ly@xmath1 by the factor @xmath314 ( ignoring differences in the amount of thermal broadening between h  i  and he  i ) .",
    "the factor @xmath3 should have been spatially variable , but the ratio @xmath315 should have been essentially spatially independent and roughly equal to unity at relevant redshifts .",

    "in contrast , he  i  @xmath0  absorption is unsaturated in all except the densest regions , even for @xmath78 .",
    "this absorption provides a complementary window into the ionization state of intergalactic helium at @xmath11 that can definitively test whether an opaque region in the he  ii  ly@xmath1 forest was due to a large - scale he  ii  region . even for realistic amounts of instrumental noise and foreground h  i  ly@xmath1 absorption",
