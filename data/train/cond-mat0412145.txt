    "spin transport through hybrid structures of both semiconductor and metal systems is now a well - established field of research@xcite . in recent years ,",
    "also spin transport through quantum dots formed by nanotubes , molecular systems or nanoparticles has started to attract attention both experimentally@xcite and theoretically.@xcite one of the motivations for this has been the possibility of using quantum dots with a single spin as qubits , but naturally also a number of fundamental questions arise on how the interplay of spin coherence and interactions influences the transport .    when the spin coherence is maintained during the electron passage through the mesoscopic structure , the transport needs to be described in a coherent fashion at least for spin degree of freedom . even for weak tunneling one",
    "therefore has to modify the usual rate equation approach if the magnetization directions are non - collinear.@xcite for stronger tunneling coupling also many of the non - equilibrium green s function methods fail to describe the case when both interactions and spin coherence are important , such as for example the hubbard i approximations used in refs .  .@xcite    for the strong coupling case ,",
    "a particular interesting situation occurs when the mesoscopic system has a magnetization which is non - collinear with respect to that of the ferromagnetic leads , which is what is studied in this paper .",
    "we study the conductance of a single - level quantum dot connected to ferromagnetic leads , and , in addition , the spin states of the quantum dot being split due to , e.g. , an applied magnetic field .",
    "experimentally , one could realize this geometry if the magnetic leads are fabricated as magnetic thin films , where the magnetic field is strongly pinned in the plane parallel to the film , so that a small magnetic field component can be applied to the quantum dot without changing the magnetization direction of the leads .",
    "the geometry of the device is illustrated in fig .  1 .    , and the interplay between interactions and spin interference . ]",
    "we describe the system using a modified anderson hamiltonian where the leads are assumed to be polarized and the magnetic field gives rise to an energy splitting of the dot level .",
    "this gives an effective double - slit geometry with two different paths through the central region . in the case of parallel magnetizations of the leads and",
    "no coulomb repulsion on the dot , we find sharp anti - resonances in the conductance for certain angles @xmath0 , which is explained as destructive interference .",
    "if the coulomb repulsion on the dot is increased , a cross - over to a simple spin - valve behavior is seen . changing the angle @xmath0 in an experimental setup",
    "can therefore indicate whether interactions on the dot are important or if a single - electron picture is sufficient . on the other hand , in the case of anti - parallel magnetizations of the leads",
    "no change in the angular dependence is observed when the coulomb repulsion on the dot is increased .",
    "finally , we limit ourselves in this paper to the study of linear response , so non - equilibrium effects associated with spin accumulation are not included .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we set up the model hamiltonian .",
    "we start by calculating the conductance for the non - interacting case in section  [ sec : nonint ] , and in section  [ sec : cotun ] we consider the cotunneling limit .",

    "the model hamiltonian of the quantum dot coupled to magnetic leads is @xmath1 where @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the left or right electrode and where we have assumed that the polarizations of the electrodes are parallel or anti - parallel .",
    "the magnetization of the quantum dot is not necessarily parallel to those of the leads and in the spin basis of the leads , the dot hamiltonian is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the orbital quantum dot energy , @xmath6 represents the magnetic field splitting , and @xmath7 is the coulomb energy for double occupancy . in a diagonal basis , the dot hamiltonian is @xmath8 where the @xmath9 and @xmath10 operators are related by the unitary rotation @xmath11 finally , the tunneling hamiltonian is @xmath12 here we allow for the tunneling matrix element to be spin dependent , because the states in the leads depend on spin direction .",
    "the possibility of spin flip processes during the tunneling process is not included explicitly here , however , it could easily be included by replacing the diagonal matrix @xmath13 by a non - diagonal tunneling matrix . depending on parameters this would correspond to having an angle between the lead magnetizations , which would modify the details but not the general behaviors that we discuss .",
    "we start by discussing the current through the system in absence of correlations , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "this treatment is relevant where mean - field approaches are valid ( of course @xmath15 should be determined self - consistently ) , e.g. for a resonant tunneling junction system .",

    "the anti - resonance occurs due to a destructive interference between the transmissions through the two spin split levels , as explained in the following section .",
    "it is interesting to note that the zero transmission at @xmath42 is not broadened by higher order tunneling events , as one might have expected .",
    "moreover , for the non - symmetric situation @xmath43 , the anti - resonance remains , but is shifted away from @xmath42 to the point where @xmath44 , which follows from eq .  .",

    "[ fig : gexact ] we show examples of the angle dependence of the conductance for both the parallel and antiparallel cases .    a difference between the parallel and antiparallel geometry is the existence of an optimal @xmath6-value in the antiparallel case . considering the symmetric condition @xmath40",
    ", we find for the parallel case ( @xmath51 ) @xmath52 which decreases when increasing @xmath6 , because the levels are moved away from the chemical potentials of the leads .",

    "in the presence of interactions the interesting interference effect discussed above can be significantly changed . naturally , this is in general a difficult problem to tackle . here",
    "we look at the case where the position of the levels is far from resonance as defined below , and a second order perturbation calculation suffices .",
    "this is the  cotunneling \" regime , where an electron is transferred through the system in a two - electron process .",
    "the cotunneling appproach is valid far from resonance , i.e. when @xmath63 and @xmath64 are larger than the bias , temperature and tunneling broadening .    for the resonant case",
    "the cotunneling result diverges and there is a cross - over to the sequential tunneling regime , see app .",
    "[ sec : seq ] . in these points",
    "interactions are not important , because transport is determined by only one level .",

    "the current is now given by processes which bring an electron from the left to the right lead , @xmath73 , minus the opposite processes : @xmath74 the transition rates will only be calculated to lowest non - vanishing order in the coupling .",

    "first , we outline the derivation for @xmath73 in the parallel configuration . in the fully polarized case , the leads contain only electrons with one kind of spin , say spin - up , and the final states are @xmath85 , meaning that an electron is moved from the left to the right lead in the process . inserting the expressions for the final states and the tunneling hamiltonian in eqs .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ toperator ] ) , we see that the first non - vanishing term is second order in the coupling @xmath86 .",

    "the dot spin eigenstates are superpositions of the lead spin states , which gives two possible paths through the dot .",

    "we have thus focused on two cases : 1 ) strong tunneling and no interaction , and 2 ) weak tunneling with interaction .",
    "the cross - over between these two regimes is an interesting and challenging issue , because a formalism that captures both coherence and correlations on equal footing is needed .",
    "in the main part , we have discussed the effects of higher order tunneling where interference effects take place . for completeness",
    ", we here give the results for the sequential tunneling limit for parallel magnetization .    in the parallel case",

    "are given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the inverse temperature .",
