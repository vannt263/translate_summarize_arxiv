    "surfaces and curvature are the key ingredients in a number of problems and phenomena in mathematics and physics .",
    "the differential geometry of surfaces in three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 has been completed , in essence , at the end of last and the beginning of this century ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "basic differential equations which describe surfaces in @xmath0 have been studied from various points of view .",
    "a study of the interrelation between special classes of surfaces and linear and nonlinear differential equations ( pde ) has been one of the classical problems of differential geometry @xcite-@xcite .",
    "interfaces , surfaces , fronts and their dynamics are also the key objects in numerous nonlinear phenomena in classical physics , such as surface waves , growth of crystals , propagation of flame fronts , deformations of membranes and many problems of hydrodynamics ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . in quantum field theory and statistical physics surfaces",
    "are of importance , too .",
    "numerous papers have been devoted to the study and applications of integrals over surfaces in gauge field theories , string theory , quantum gravity and statistical physics ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .    the discovery of the inverse scattering ( spectral ) transform ( ist  ) method , a powerful tool to construct and solve integrable pdes ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) ,",
    "about 30 years ago , gave a new impulse for the study of the interrelations between nonlinear pdes and differential geometry of surfaces .",
    "on one hand , new nonlinear integrable pdes ( in addition to the sine - gordon and liouville equations ) with a particular geometrical meaning have been found ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the ist method has been used to construct wide classes of surfaces ( see e.g. @xcite- @xcite ) .    an alternative use of the ist method in the framework of differential geometry of surfaces has been proposed recently in the papers @xcite-@xcite . the approach discussed in @xcite allows to generate surfaces in @xmath1 ( and @xmath2 ) via two - dimensional linear problems and formulate their integrable dynamics via the associated 2 + 1-dimensional integrable pdes .",
    "this approach has been applied in 2-dimensional gravity @xcite and in some pure mathematical problems of differential geometry @xcite .",
    "the approach discussed in @xcite and @xcite is quite different .",
    "it is mainly concerned with the intrinsic geometry of surfaces and spaces . in @xcite",
    "it was noted , in particular , that the recent results on exact solutions of the one - dimensional schrdinger equation and the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation provide us with the variety of surfaces where metric and gaussian curvature are given by simple explicit formulas .",
    "surfaces of revolution form a very special and simple class of surfaces .",
    "nevertheless , they are of great importance both in mathematics and in physics . perhaps , they are the best candidates to deal with in terms of the approach proposed in @xcite and @xcite , also since in the literature only few examples of surfaces of revolution ( spherical and pseudospherical surfaces of constant gaussian curvature , catenoid ) are discussed .    in the present paper",
    "we consider surfaces of revolution in three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 and their integrable deformations ( dynamics ) .",
    "our approach is based on the observation that surfaces of revolution in @xmath0 are completely governed by the one - dimensional schrdinger equation in the sense that the gauss equation for surfaces in terms of geodesic coordinates , i.e. with a metric    @xmath3    simply reads    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the gaussian curvature .",
    "it is used , for instance , to analyze surfaces of constant gaussian curvature ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the connection of ( [ e1.1 ] ) with the standard one - dimensional schrdinger equation    @xmath6    is established by the simple relations    @xmath7    in this paper we will analyze and visualize the surfaces of revolution associated with well - known solvable cases of equation ( [ e1.2 ] ) .",
    "we treat the infinite well potential , @xmath8-function potential , harmonic oscillator , effective radial coulomb potential and bargmann potentials .",
    "physically motivated  surfaces of revolution have several properties which distinguish them from the old  mathematically motivated  surfaces , like the catenoid . in particular , surfaces of revolution associated with the bound states are spindle - shaped surfaces which at infinity tend to strings .",
    "the surfaces generated by the @xmath9-th excited bound state have @xmath10 knots ( conic points ) .",
    "we will consider also the deformations ( dynamics ) of surfaces of revolution of two distinct types .",
    "the evolutions of the first type preserve the gaussian curvature @xmath11 and change the metric according to    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are two arbitrary functions of the parameter @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the solution of the schrdinger equation ( [ e1.2 ] ) linear independent to @xmath17 .",
    "the simplest case @xmath18 corresponds just to the rescaling of the metric .",
    "but even this simple transformation can deform the surface drastically .",
    "for instance , for an increasing function @xmath19 the evolution in @xmath15 may generate discontinuities on the surface for certain @xmath15 and , finally , may lead to the splitting of the surface into disconnected parts .",
    "the deformations with @xmath20 create edges and singularities in the profile of the surface in @xmath0 immediately , i.e. for any @xmath21 .",
    "regular surfaces of revolution associated with the bound states are absolutely instable with respect to such deformations . the particular class of deformations for which",
    "@xmath22    where @xmath23 is an arbitrary function of @xmath15 and @xmath24 indicates the derivative with respect to @xmath15 , corresponds to liouville type evolutions recently discussed in @xcite . in this case",
    "the function @xmath25 obeys the equation @xmath26 .",
    "another type of deformation is of completely different nature .",
    "it is given by the kdv equation for the gaussian curvature    @xmath27    and by the equation    @xmath28    for the metric .",
    "the kdv equation is integrable by the ist method and has a number of very interesting properties ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the kdv - type transformations of surfaces inherits all these properties .",
    "in particular , it preserves an infinite set of integral characteristics of the surface of the type    @xmath29    where the @xmath30 are differential polynomials of @xmath5 ( e.g. @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) .",
    "in contrast to the deformations of the first type the kdv - type deformations tend to smooth out the surfaces of revolution .",
    "they described by explicit formulas for the so - called multi - soliton solutions of the kdv equation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the basic formulas for the surfaces of revolution .",
    "the following sections 3 - 8 contain the discussion of the surfaces generated by well - known solvable potentials of the schrdinger equation .",
    "then the two types of deformations of surfaces of revolution are introduced .",
    "their properties are discussed for the examples treated in the preceding sections .",
    "here we will present for convenience some basic formulas for the surfaces of revolution in @xmath0 ( see e.g. @xcite- @xcite ) . a surface of revolution is a surface which is obtained by the rotation of a plane curve around an axis belonging to the same plane . denoting the cartesian coordinates in @xmath0 as @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 one can define a surface of revolution according to    @xmath37    where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the angle in the @xmath34-@xmath35 plane and @xmath40 is a arbitrary function of @xmath41 .",
    "the choice of the function @xmath42 specifies the surface of revolution .",
    "the euclidean metric in @xmath0 induces on the surface ( [ e2.1 ] ) the following metric    @xmath43dr^2+r^2d\\varphi ^2   \\label{e2.2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 . introducing the variables @xmath45 and @xmath46 via    @xmath47    and    @xmath48    one converts the metric ( [ e2.2 ] ) into the form    @xmath49    the lines @xmath50 are the meridians , which are geodesics , and the lines @xmath51 are the parallels of the surface of revolution .",
    "the meridians and parallels are also curvature lines . for surfaces of revolution",
    "the metric depends only on @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding gauss equation reads    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the gaussian curvature .",
    "the second fundamental form and other characteristics also have a very simple structure in the geodesic coordinates @xmath45 and @xmath39 .    locally any form ( [ e2.5 ] ) corresponds to a surface of revolution in @xmath0 .",
    "if one considers the global properties of surfaces of revolution , however , it is necessary to pay attention to the following . equations ( [ e2.3 ] ) and ( [ e2.4 ] ) imply that    @xmath54    or    @xmath55    where @xmath56 .",
    "given @xmath57 one gets from ( [ e2.8 ] )    @xmath58    this formula together with ( [ e2.4 ] ) defines the surface of revolution in @xmath0 according to ( [ e2.1 ] ) .",
    "however , the constraint    @xmath59    for the values of the coordinate @xmath45 has to be taken into account . in other words , ( [ e2.9 ] ) defines the set of admissable values of @xmath45 while ( [ e2.4 ] ) determines the corresponding set of admissable values of @xmath41 .",
    "we will construct the surfaces in such a way that there will be no gaps in the profile of the surface along the @xmath36-axis .",
    "thus , in the case when @xmath45 varies in the set of disconnected intervals we join the surface at the end of the intervals in order to avoid gaps .",
    "it is clear , however , that in general depending on the choice of the explicit form of the metric @xmath46 the profile of the surface of revolution thus may exhibit discontinuities or singularities connected to the existence of different intervals of admissable values of @xmath45 .",
    "the weakest irregularity consists of edges which are due to a jump in @xmath60 but still satisfying the constraint ( [ e2.9 ] ) .",
    "the points for which @xmath61 have to be considered carefully . at these points",
    "we have    @xmath62    and    @xmath63    the points under consideration do not belong to the surface , but if @xmath46 is finite it is possible to connect the surface by assigning appropriate values .",
    "this can give rise to the situation that the tangent plane at these points on the surface is parallel to the @xmath34-@xmath35-plane .",
    "if @xmath64 changes sign at these points the surface of revolution will have cuspidal edges .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath65 for a whole interval of @xmath45 the surface will be in general disconnected by a gap parallel to the @xmath34-@xmath35-plane .",
    "note , that we will use the term cuspidal edge also for the boundary of finite surfaces having the property ( [ e2.9a ] ) .",
    "well - known examples of surfaces of revolution are the spherical ( @xmath66 ) and the pseudospherical ( @xmath67 ) surfaces and the catenoid ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) .",
    "some other examples can be found in @xcite .    in our approach to the surfaces of revolution we will follow the papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we start with the presentation of the gauss equation ( [ e2.6 ] ) in the form of the standard one - dimensional schrdinger equation    @xmath70    for a given solution of ( [ e2.10 ] ) with fixed @xmath71 , energy @xmath72 and wavefunction @xmath73 one gets a solution of the gauss equation ( [ e2.6 ] ) via the identification    @xmath74    our selection of surfaces of revolution is motivated by the physics associated with the schrdinger equation ( [ e2.10 ] )",
    ". we will consider the exactly solvable cases and mainly the corresponding bound states , i.e. stationary states of the discrete spectrum .",
    "cases when the potential @xmath71 has singularities will be discussed as well .",
    "more complicated problems like the scattering problems and surfaces generated by schrdinger equations with random potentials will be considered elsewhere .",
    "all figures presented here have been made using the plotting facilities of maple . since the integration in ( [ e2.12 ] )",
    "can in general not be calculated in closed form a cubic spline approximation for the integrand has been used to get an polynomial approximation of the function @xmath75 in the interval of interest which can always be calculated to arbitrary accuracy @xcite .",
    "we start with the simplest possible case for the schrdinger equation , i.e. the free motion . for @xmath76 and positive energy , @xmath77 , the general form of the associated",
    "metric is    @xmath78    where @xmath79 and @xmath13 and @xmath80 are arbitrary real constants . without loss of generality",
    "one can put @xmath81 . in this case",
    "we have    @xmath82    therefore three different classes of surfaces are possible .    * in the case @xmath83 one has + @xmath84 + leading to + @xmath85 + and our surface is the standard sphere of radius @xmath86 . due to the fact",
    "that @xmath46 according to ( [ e3.1 ] ) is periodic in @xmath45 we will get an infinite number of spheres glued to each other along the @xmath36-axis ( figure 1 ) . * for @xmath87",
    "there is also no constraint on the values of @xmath45 .",
    "the solution of ( [ e3.2 ] ) is given in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "the surface looks like an infinite sequence of pressed spheres similar to american footballs , which are depicted in figure 2 . *",
    "if we choose @xmath88 the variable @xmath45 is allowed to vary within the intervals defined by the inequality @xmath89 .",
    "the surface consists of an infinite sequence of pieces from which a single surface is shown in figure 3 .",
    "we see that the form of these surfaces depends crucially on the choice of the normalization constant @xmath13 . in the first and the second case we have a regular surface while in the third case the surface has cuspidal edges which disconnect it into distinct finite pieces .",
    "the situation is quite different for the nonphysical case of negative energy @xmath90 . with this choice",
    "there are three different solutions of equation ( [ e2.10 ] ) , namely    @xmath91    where @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are arbitrary real constants . in the first and the second case the corresponding surfaces exhibit edges independent of the choice of @xmath92 and @xmath93 at the points @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "they are presented in figure 4 and 5 . in the third case",
    ", however , the corresponding surface has only one edge at the point @xmath97 .",
    "shifting @xmath98 one gets the surface defined for @xmath99 with the cuspidal edge at @xmath100 and with @xmath101 , which is shown in figure 6 . it",
    "is nothing but the famous pseudosphere .",
    "it is generated by the rotation of the so - called tractrix .",
    "all surfaces presented in this section are well - known .",
    "they correspond to spherical ( @xmath77 ) and pseudospherical ( @xmath102 ) surfaces of different types , which hence all are generated by the physically simplest case of the schrdinger equation , namely , free motion .",
    "let us consider now the simplest nontrivial potential , namely the infinite well potential    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is a constant . in this case one has bound states with energies    @xmath105    and the corresponding wavefunctions @xcite",
    "@xmath106    where @xmath107 are arbitrary real constants , since we do not require the normalization of the wavefunction .",
    "the choice of @xmath71 according to ( [ e4.1 ] ) leads to an infinite family of surfaces whose metric is given by    @xmath108    since @xmath109 our surfaces have constant gaussian curvature @xmath110 for @xmath111 and infinite negative curvature outside this interval .",
    "therefore within the infinite well they look like the surfaces with positive gaussian curvature described in the previous section while outside they have the form of infinitely thin tubes , i.e. strings going to infinity .",
    "the ground state @xmath112 gives rise to three different surfaces depending on the choice of @xmath92 .",
    "for @xmath113 we have the surface which consists of the standard sphere of radius @xmath104 , connected with the infinities by strings from the south and north poles , respectively ( left upper picture in figure 7 ) . if @xmath114 we have surfaces of the type shown in the left upper picture of figure 8 , while the case @xmath115 is depicted in the left upper part of figure 9 .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that in this case at the points where @xmath116 the modulus of the wavefunction is not equal to zero .",
    "gluing the strings , whose radius is zero , thus introduces a jump of the radius .    for excited states ( @xmath117 ) the corresponding surfaces of revolution look like a chain of @xmath10 pieces of the form as for @xmath112 separated by @xmath118 knots ( conic points ) and connected by strings to infinity .",
    "if we choose @xmath119 we get a chain of spheres with radius @xmath120 ( figure 7 ) , for @xmath121 the chain consists of squeezed spheres ( figure 8) which are extended to infinity by the strings .",
    "the choice @xmath122 is connected to a sequence of squeezed and cut spheres separated by cuspidal edges .",
    "as before , this is accompanied by a jump of the radius to zero for the strings tending to infinity ( figure 9 ) .    it should be noted that if one chooses for the amplitude @xmath107 the physical normalization of the function @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) , i.e. @xmath125 then the n - th excited state gives rise to the sequence of spheres if @xmath126 .",
    "the next of our examples is determined by the potential    @xmath127    where @xmath128 is a positive real constant and @xmath129 is the dirac delta - function .",
    "there is one bound state with    @xmath130    and the corresponding wavefunction reads @xcite    @xmath131    for @xmath132 the surface is of the form shown in figure 10 .",
    "it extends to infinity and has an discontinuity at @xmath100 .",
    "if @xmath133 it becomes the cuspidal edge ( @xmath134 at @xmath100 ) and the corresponding surface , which can be seen in figure 11 , consists of two parts ( @xmath135 and @xmath99 ) where both are just the pseudosphere discussed in section 3 . in the case of @xmath136",
    "the surface of revolution is built from two disconnected intervals of the parameter @xmath45 , namely @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "they have cuspidal edges at @xmath139 .",
    "each of these parts is nothing but the pseudosphere .",
    "for the solutions @xmath73 with @xmath77 the corresponding surfaces look similar to the case of free motion with @xmath77 .    in a similar manner",
    "one can construct surfaces associated with a potential which is the sum of several @xmath8-functions .",
    "the presence of @xmath8-functions allows us to describe surfaces with constant gaussian curvature except at some points which correspond to edges .",
    "the dirac comb potential    @xmath140    is of particular interest . in solid state physics it is used as a model potential with periodic structure which leads to energy bands for the stationary states . in our approach",
    "it allows to describe surfaces with an infinite number of cuspidal edges . if @xmath141 the dirac comb generates for @xmath77 surfaces which look like pieces of the form as in figure 3 glued together . between the points",
    "@xmath142 they have constant positive gaussian curvature while at these points the curvature is negative and infinite .",
    "the case @xmath143 and @xmath102 corresponds to the surface which consists of an infinite sequence of the parts presented in the figures 4 and 5 .",
    "so we have the  pseudospherical surface with an infinite set of edges .",
    "note , that if we exclude the points @xmath142 then the rest is the disconnected pseudospherical surface .",
    "the following example is the famous harmonic oscillator potential , namely @xmath144    it has an infinite set of stationary states with the energies    @xmath145    and the wavefunctions    @xmath146    where @xmath147 are the hermite polynomials and @xmath107 are arbitrary real constants @xcite . for the ground state ( @xmath148 ) , the first ( @xmath112 ) and the second ( @xmath149 ) excited state the corresponding wavefunctions take the form    @xmath150\\exp \\left ( -\\frac{x^2}2\\right ) , \\label{e6.1e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    respectively . in the figures 12 , 13 and 14 one can see the induced surfaces for a choice of the constants @xmath107 which satisfies the constraint @xmath151 for all @xmath45 .",
    "figure 15 shows a surface connected to the ground state where @xmath152 was chosen in such a way that at the points @xmath153 the tangent plane on the surface is parallel to the @xmath34-@xmath35-plane , i.e. @xmath116 .",
    "with the help of the substitution    @xmath154    the radial schrdinger equation for the hydrogen atom can be reduced to the one - dimensional equation ( @xcite ,  36 )    @xmath155 \\psi = 2e\\psi ,   \\label{e7.1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath156 is the angular momentum and we substituted @xmath41 by @xmath45 .",
    "the functions @xmath73 corresponding to the bound states with energies    @xmath157    are given in the form    @xmath158    in ( [ e7.2 ] ) the functions @xmath159are the laguerre polynomials and @xmath107 are as usual arbitrary real constants .",
    "as can be seen from ( [ e7.1 ] ) the gaussian curvature now has pole type singularities . for the ground state ( @xmath112 , @xmath160 )",
    "we thus have    @xmath161    figure 16 gives an impression of the surface .",
    "for @xmath149 we have the bound states with @xmath160 ,    @xmath162    and @xmath163 corresponding to    @xmath164    the figures 17 and 18 show the surfaces of revolution , respectively .",
    "a wide class of solvable potentials for the schrdinger equation is given by the multi - bargmann potentials ( see e.g. @xcite - @xcite ) .",

    "let us first consider the simplest bargmann potential , i.e. @xmath181 .",
    "depending on the choice of the parameter @xmath182 we get three different types of surfaces .",
    "we will only treat the case when @xmath13 is chosen in such a way that the condition @xmath183 is satisfied which corresponds to regular surfaces of revolution .",
    "* for the bound state we put @xmath184 which leads to @xmath185 + where @xmath13 is once again an arbitrary real constant .",
    "the corresponding surface looks like a bubble which decays exponentially fast into strings tending to infinity .",
    "figure 19 shows the surface . *",
    "the case of zero energy , i.e. @xmath186 leads to the corresponding surface of revolution plotted in figure 20 .",
    "gaussian curvature and metric take the form @xmath187 * if we want to consider a positive energy we have to choose @xmath182 real .",
    "the associated surface of revolution then represents a scattering state which , up to a slight decrease of the amplitude in the area where the potential has its maximum , is similar to the free motion case . in that case",
    "we have @xmath188 .",
    "\\label{e8.9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + figure 21 shows the surface for a special choice of parameters .",
    "note , that far from the potential well the surface has the same periodic form on both sides .",
    "this corresponds exactly to the transparency of the bargmann potential .    in the case",
    "@xmath189 we end up with a potential having two wells separated by a distance which can be adjusted freely simply by fixing the corresponding parameters .",
    "we will omit the formulas for gaussian curvature and the metric here , they can be derived straightforward from ( [ e8.1 ] ) and ( [ e8.2 ] ) , for details we refer to section 10 .",
    "two figures might be sufficient to illustrate the situation , namely in figure 22 we see a surface corresponding to the ground state of the 2-soliton potential , whereas figure 23 shows the excited bound state surface .",
    "in this section we will consider deformations of the surfaces of revolution constructed above .",
    "the simplest type of deformations is given by rescaling the metric , i.e.    @xmath190    where @xmath191 is an arbitrary function .",
    "the gaussian curvature is invariant under such deformations , but the shape of the surfaces in @xmath0 may change drastically .    let us start with the surfaces associated with the free motion ( section 3 ) at @xmath77 in the case @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath192 and @xmath193 be a monotonically increasing function with @xmath194 . hence at @xmath195 we have the surfaces of the type depicted in figure 2 .",
    "for @xmath196 the height of each segment increases and at the moment @xmath197 defined by @xmath198 the surface becomes the sphere . for @xmath199 there will be cuspidal edges and the surface changes its shape to that given in figure 3 . for monotonically decreasing functions @xmath193",
    "the deformations of the surface proceed in the opposite direction . evidently , for deformations given by functions such that @xmath200 for all @xmath15 the shape of the surface is changed unessentially .    for the pseudospherical surfaces the deformations ( [ e9.1 ] )",
    "look simpler . for the surfaces of figure 4 and 5 this type of deformations changes , in essence , only the distance between the edges . for the pseudosphere of figure 6",
    "the deformation ( [ e9.1 ] ) changes just the position of the edge which can always be shifted to the origin by a simple redefinition of @xmath45 .",
    "so , the pseudosphere is , in fact , invariant with respect to deformations ( [ e9.1 ] ) for any smooth function @xmath191 .",
    "the behavior of other surfaces of revolution considered in the previous sections under the deformations of the type ( [ e9.1 ] ) is similar . for regular surfaces ( @xmath201 ) corresponding to bound states ( [ e9.1 ] ) will disconnect the surface .",
    "these cuts are developing , evidently , at those points where @xmath202 has maximums .",
    "for instance , for the surface generated by the bound state of the 1-soliton potential with @xmath203 the function @xmath60 has extrema at the points @xmath204 .",
    "thus , for a monotonically increasing function @xmath191 as @xmath205 , where @xmath197 is the time when @xmath202 becomes equal to one , the profile of the surface near the points @xmath206 becomes parallel to the @xmath34-@xmath35-plane at @xmath197 and later the surfaces gets disconnected figure 24 shows the behavior for a special choice of the function @xmath191 . as @xmath207 the outer ring becomes thinner and finally disappears whereupon the whole surface is converted into the pseudosphere .",
    "note , that for deformations ( [ e9.1 ] ) the splitting of surfaces after some finite time @xmath208 when starting from regular ones is a general feature .",
    "the lap @xmath208 , of course , is determined by the function @xmath191 and the smallest difference @xmath209 .",
    "a quite obvious generalization of the deformations ( [ e9.1 ] ) is of the form    @xmath210    where @xmath16 is the linearly independent solution of the schrdinger equation with respect to @xmath17 and @xmath19 and @xmath211 are two arbitrary functions which satisfy @xmath212 and @xmath213 . in the general case @xmath16 is related to @xmath214 according to    @xmath215    whereupon one can rewrite ( [ e9.2 ] ) as    @xmath216    the deformations ( [ e9.3 ] ) also do not change the gaussian curvature but their action on the profile of the surfaces is stronger than that of the transformations ( [ e9.1 ] ) .    for the standard sphere ( figure 1 )",
    "the linearly independent solution is @xmath217 so ( [ e9.3 ] ) reads explicitly    @xmath218    or    @xmath219   \\label{e9.5}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath220    thus the deformation of the sphere is given by a motion along @xmath45 with the velocity @xmath221 and a change of shape to that type shown in figure 2 as long as @xmath222 for all @xmath15 .",
    "the situation is similar for other spherical surfaces .    for the pseudospherical surfaces of figure 4 and 5 the transformation ( [ e9.3 ] ) is of the form    @xmath223    basically , this results again in shifting and rescaling the surface .",
    "the only significant change of the shape concerns the distance between the two edges .    for the pseudosphere",
    "the situation is quite different . in this case",
    "the linear independent solution of the schrdinger equation is @xmath224 leading to a deformation of the form    @xmath225    since now @xmath60 is growing not only at @xmath135 but also for @xmath99 there are for any given @xmath211 at any time @xmath21 two cuspidal edges on the deformed surface .",
    "so the deformation ( [ e9.7 ] ) creates immediately after the initial moment @xmath195 an additional edge on the pseudosphere which thereby takes a shape similar to those of figures 4 and 5 depending on the explicit form of the functions @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "a similar behavior can be observed for surfaces associated with bound states except the infinite well potential . for bound states",
    "the wavefunctions are decreasing at @xmath228 .",
    "this , however , implies that the linearly independent solution is increasing at infinity .",
    "hence the function @xmath229 defined by ( [ e9.3 ] ) always has an additional edge for any @xmath21 for any function @xmath227 .",
    "therefore , regular surfaces connected to bound states are unstable with respect to deformations of the form ( [ e9.3 ] ) .    a very particular class of deformations ( [ e9.3 ] ) can be obtained if we choose the following form for the functions @xmath226 and @xmath230    @xmath231    where @xmath23 is an arbitrary function and @xmath232 is the derivative of @xmath233 with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "this choice leads to an evolution for the schrdinger equation ( [ e2.10 ] ) recently discussed in @xcite which does not change the potential . in terms of the variable    @xmath234    such an evolution in time",
    "is governed by the liouville equation @xcite    @xmath235    the well - known general solution of the liouville equation    @xmath236 ^ 2 }   \\label{e9.10}\\ ] ]    implies    @xmath237    where @xmath238 and @xmath239 are arbitrary functions .",
    "demanding at @xmath195 that @xmath240 and @xmath241 one has    @xmath242    which after integration leads to    @xmath243    substituting this expression into ( [ e9.11 ] ) one gets    @xmath244    i.e. nothing but ( [ e9.3 ] ) with @xmath13 and @xmath14 given by ( [ e9.8 ] ) .",
    "thus the liouville type deformations have properties similar to those discussed above .",
    "figure 25 illustrates the situation for the ground state of the 1-soliton potential .",
    "a completely different class of deformations of surfaces of revolution is given by the kdv equation which governs the isospectral deformations of the schrdinger equation ( [ e2.10 ] ) .",
    "it reads ( see e.g. @xcite - @xcite )    @xmath245    while the wavefunction @xmath246 evolves according to the linear equation    @xmath247    eliminating @xmath248 from ( [ e10.2 ] ) with the use of ( [ e2.10 ] ) one gets the equation for @xmath246 only , namely    @xmath249    the kdv equation is integrable by the ist method .",
    "using this method one can analyze this equation in detail ( see e.g. @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , one reduces the solution of the nonlinear initial value problem @xmath250 to a set of linear problems . for a wide class of initial data it is possible to calculate exact asymptotics at @xmath207 .",
    "the ist method provides us with explicit formulas for the multi - soliton solutions .",
    "the kdv equation has a number of remarkable properties : infinite symmetry group , darboux and bcklund transformations and an infinite set of integrals of motion given by    @xmath251    where the densities @xmath30 are calculated via the recurrent relations    @xmath252    all @xmath253 are total derivatives .",
    "so the nontrivial integrals are given by ( [ e10.4 ] ) .",
    "the kdv deformations of surfaces of revolution are governed by the equations ( [ e10.1 ] ) - ( [ e10.3 ] ) with the substitution @xmath254 , i.e. the gaussian curvature evolves according to the equation    @xmath255    and the metric depends on time via    @xmath256    the kdv deformations of surfaces inherit all remarkable properties of the kdv equation .",
    "first , one is able to linearize the initial value problem @xmath257 for the deformations of the surfaces .",
    "moreover , it is possible to find exact asymptotic expressions for the gaussian curvature and the metric as @xmath207 and , finally , an infinite set of deformations of surfaces is given in terms of explicit formulas , namely    @xmath258 ,   \\label{e10.9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath166 and the matrix elements of the @xmath167 matrix @xmath168 read    @xmath259 x+8\\lambda _ k^3t+\\gamma _ k\\right ) } { \\lambda _ k+\\lambda _ l}.   \\label{e10.10}\\ ] ]    the matrix elements of the matrices @xmath174 are given by ( [ e10.10 ] ) with the substitution of the last column by the column @xmath260 for @xmath261 the parameters @xmath172 are real constants and @xmath262 are arbitrary phases .",
    "@xmath13 is an arbitrary amplitude . according to section 8",
    "where we discussed soliton surfaces we can now investigate their evolution under kdv deformation .",
    "to this end , we will restrict ourselves to three examples of regular surfaces , i.e. to an appropriate choice of @xmath13 .    *",
    "the surface generated by the bound state of the 1-soliton potential evolves in time according to the following gaussian curvature and metric @xmath263 + the deformation ( [ e10.11 ] ) and ( [ e10.12 ] ) is nothing but the uniform motion of the 1-soliton surface along the @xmath36-axis with the constant velocity @xmath264 without a change of motion ( cf .",
    "figure 19 ) . * in the case of two solitons we can write the potential in the form ( @xmath265 ) + @xmath266 + with + @xmath267   \\label{e10.12b } \\\\ & &   \\nonumber \\\\ w_2 & = & \\left [ \\lambda _ 2\\cosh \\xi _ 1\\cosh \\xi _ 2-\\lambda",
    "_ 1\\sinh \\xi _ 1\\sinh \\xi _ 2\\right ] ^2   \\label{e10.12c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + and + @xmath268 + thus for the ground state the gaussian curvature and the metric take the form @xmath269 + while the surface corresponding to first excited state is described by @xmath270 + for the ground state we see one bubble moving along the @xmath36-axis which in contrast to the 1-soliton case slightly changes its shape . the first excited state , however , mimics the 2-soliton interaction of the kdv equation .",
    "figures 26 and 27 illustrate the deformation of the two surfaces of revolution .    for the kdv deformations",
    "the gaussian curvature evolves in time but there is an infinite set of integral characteristic of the surfaces which are preserved .",
    "they are of the form ( [ e10.4 ] ) with the substitution @xmath271 . for @xmath171-soliton deformations these integral characteristics",
    "are ( see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath272    it is known that any initial data which obey the constraint ( see @xcite-@xcite )    @xmath273    decompose asymptotically ( @xmath207 ) under the kdv evolution into pure solitons . in terms of surfaces this means that asymptotically we end up with soliton surfaces . to obtain a regular surface for all times the amplitude @xmath13 has to be fixed in an appropriate way , but",
    "since during the evolution the wavefunction is bounded it is always possible to adjust @xmath13 such that @xmath183 for all @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , the kdv deformations tend to smooth out the initial surfaces .",
    "indeed , let us take the @xmath8-function as the initial data , i.e. @xmath274 . the corresponding pseudosphere has an edge at @xmath100 . under the kdv evolution",
    "this initial data converts asymptotically into one soliton ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the kdv deformation converts the pseudosphere figure 11 into the soliton bubble , figure 19 , as @xmath275 .",
    "in contrast , starting from the regular 1-soliton surface the deformations discussed in section 9 , namely ( [ e9.1 ] ) and ( [ e9.3 ] ) create at finite time or immediately singularities , i.e. edges .",
    "so , there is a crucial difference between the kdv deformations and those which preserve the gaussian curvature .",
    "the former tend to smooth out the surfaces while the latter create singularities .",
