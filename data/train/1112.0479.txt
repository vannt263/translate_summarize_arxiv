    "each such representation @xmath8 is attached to a tempered distribution @xmath10 on @xmath0 , called the intertwining distribution of @xmath8 , which is uniquely determined up to a scalar multiple .",

    "let @xmath13 denote the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath11 , and let @xmath14 be the subalgebra of the @xmath6-invariants in @xmath13 .",
    "then the intertwining distribution turns out to be @xmath9-invariant and an eigendistribution of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with eigenvalue equal to the infinitesimal characters of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ; see @xcite .",
    "in other words , @xmath18 is an invariant eigendistibution on the symplectic space @xmath0 .",
    "harish - chandra s method of descent is one of the main tools for studying questions involving the structure of invariant eigendistributions on a real reductive lie algebra @xmath11 .",
    "ultimately , it transfers problems of invariant harmonic analysis from the lie algebra @xmath11 to the cartan subalgebras of @xmath11 , see for example @xcite .",
    "our goal is to develop a `` method of descent '' allowing us to study invariant eigendistributions on symplectic spaces .",
    "we use the fact that the symplectic space @xmath0 is the odd part @xmath19 of a classical real lie superalgebra @xmath20 , which is constructed from the dual pair @xmath21 .",
    "the method of descent will consist in transferring problems of invariant harmonic analysis from @xmath19 to suitably defined cartan subspaces in @xmath19 .",
    "( notice that the name `` cartan subspace '' is also used in other contexts , for example in the theory of symmetric spaces .",
    "our usage of this term is however different . )",
    "to single out the candidates for the cartan subspaces in @xmath19 , one needs a detailed knowledge of the geometry of the adjoint action of @xmath22 on @xmath19 .",
    "this step has been accomplished in @xcite for all irreducible reductive dual pairs except for the two following ortho - symplectic cases : @xmath23 the results of this paper also include these two cases .",
    "this leads us to a definition of cartan subspace which is slightly different from the one used in @xcite , as well as to the notion of almost semisimple elements in @xmath19 .",
    "the definitions agree with those from @xcite when the dual pair is not isomorphic to ( [ basic assumption - one ] ) or ( [ basic assumption - two ] ) .",
    "in fact , most of the results of @xcite carry over .",
    "our first result is an analog of the weyl harish - chandra formula on the symplectic space @xmath0 ( theorem [ weyl integration ] ) .",
    "it gives the integral on @xmath24 of a continuous compactly supported function in terms of semisimple orbital integrals parametrized by the mutually non - conjugate cartan subspaces of @xmath19 .",
    "as an important intermediate step , we prove that the set of the semisimple elements in @xmath0 is dense , unless the dual pair is isomorphic to ( [ basic assumption - one ] ) or ( [ basic assumption - two ] ) .",
    "this property was stated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 6.6 ) without a proof .",
    "here we show explicitly how any nilpotent element of @xmath0 may be approximated by semisimple elements .",
    "for the remaining cases we introduce the notion of almost semisimple elements and show that they are dense ( theorem [ density ] ) .",
    "weyl harish - chandra formula provides an orbital integral decomposition for the integral on @xmath24 of continuous compactly supported functions . for the analysis of tempered eigendistributions",
    ", one needs to know that this formula extends to schwartz functions on @xmath0 .",
    "the main result of this article , theorem [ 3.30 ] , shows that any such orbital integral of a rapidly decreasing function on @xmath0 is rapidly decreasing at infinity on @xmath25 , though it might have logarithmic growth near walls defined by some real roots .",
    "this guarantees the extension of weyl harish - chandra formula to schwartz functions .",
    "however , unlike the lie algebra case , it is not necessarily true that a semisimple orbital integral of a schwartz function on the symplectic space is a schwartz function on the corresponding cartan subspace , though it is certainly differentiable on the regular set . since the radial components of invariant differential operators in this setting do not behave as well as in the case of a lie algebra",
    ", it does nt seem to be easy to estimate these derivatives .",
    "our analysis follows closely harish - chandra s work .",
    "indeed , the even part @xmath26 of the lie superalgebra @xmath20 is the reductive lie algebra @xmath27 .",
    "so the map of @xmath19 to @xmath26 given by @xmath28 relates geometrical and analytical objects on @xmath19 to the corresponding objects on @xmath29 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath30 is a cartan subspace , then @xmath31 , that is the linear span of the all the anticommutants of the elements of @xmath32 , is contained in some cartan subalgebra of @xmath26 .",
    "nevertheless we shall need several ingredients not included in the work of harish - chandra .",
    "for instance , in the proof of proposition [ 2.2pro ] , we need rossmann s theorem expressing some nilpotent orbital integrals as limits of derivatives of the harish - chandra semisimple integrals , @xcite",
    ".    the regularity properties of an invariant eigendistribution @xmath33 on @xmath24 can be obtained from the analysis of the system of partial differential equations it satisfies . by determining the characteristic variety of this system ,",
    "we prove in corollary [ 4.13 ] that the restriction of @xmath33 to the set @xmath34 of the regular almost semisimple elements is a smooth function .",
    "however , most of the times , this distribution is not regular on the entire @xmath0 .",
    "we will provide some examples in our future work .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : intertwining ] we recall the construction of the intertwining distribution attached to an irreducible admissible representation in howe s correspondence . in section [ section : orbital semisimple ] we collect some results on orbital integrals on semisimple lie algebras which will be needed in the lie superalgebra situation .",
    "the study of the adjoint action of a dual reductive pair @xmath35 on the symplectic space @xmath0 is developed in section [ section : weyl - integration - w ] .",
    "we use the lie superalgebra approach from @xcite by considering @xmath0 as the odd part @xmath19 of a classical real lie superalgebra @xmath20 .",
    "we introduce a general notion of cartan subspace of @xmath19 which for complex dual pairs coincides with the notion of cartan subspace in @xcite",
    ". then we prove the density in @xmath19 of the almost semisimple elements ( theorem [ density ] ) .",
    "this yields the weyl harish - chandra formula on @xmath19 ( theorem [ weyl integration ] ) . in section [ section : orbital symplectic ]",
    "we make a detailed study of the orbital integrals through each cartan subspace in @xmath19 .",
    "theorem [ 3.30 ] provides sharp estimates for the orbital integral of rapidly decreasing functions on @xmath0 .",
    "the structure theory developed in section [ section : weyl - integration - w ] reduces the proof of this theorem to the analysis of three special cases : the case of elliptic cartan subspaces ; the case a dual pair of the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 or @xmath38 ( the quaternions ) ; the case of @xmath39 with centralizer of @xmath31 in @xmath26 equal to a fundamental cartan subalgebra .",
