    "similar solution was published by _",
    "the mie solution satisfies also the scattering on many spheres with the same structure and diameter  like scattering on the drops .",
    "the _ mie _ solutions in widely used in various situations up to nowadays .",
    "many scientists ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others ) show a lot of simply models , more simply than _ _",

    "unfortunately , all of this approximations , works only in strictly defined area ( sometimes with great error ) . for precisely calculation done in all the spectrum of measure we must used the main theory , now is only one such theory  _",

    "the process of light scattering is described by amplitude * a * of electric field * e * :    @xmath0    the dependencies of angle give us angle distribution like :    @xmath1    after integration over all angles it takes us total cross section .",
    "amplitude can be write also in such form :    @xmath2    this form is more useful for calculation of physically dependencies . for example ,",
    "amplitude of radiation , with parallel polarisation , is equal to :    @xmath3    and for perpendicular    @xmath4    for non - polarised wave the intensity of reflected light is equal :    @xmath5    these components give us total intensity @xmath6 :    @xmath7    polarisation @xmath8 is given as :    @xmath9    if @xmath10 , then we get the known _ rayleigh _ s results for amplitude    @xmath11    intensity is expressed by :    @xmath12    and polarisation as :    @xmath13",
    "we consider electrical field satisfied the maxwell equations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . if @xmath14 , then :    @xmath15    using an operator notation @xcite we can write : @xmath16 both @xmath17 and @xmath18 have a well - known structure :    @xmath19    @xmath20    where @xmath21 are the _ legendre _ polynomials .",
