    "observation shows a structure of a universe with scaling rules , where we can see globular clusters , single clusters or superclusters of galaxies , in which stars can be treated as massive point - like constituents of a universe mad of dust .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", starting from an universal scaling law , we showed its equality with the well  known random walk equation or brownian motion relation that was firstly used by eddington @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "consequently , we arrived at a self - similar universe .",
    "it was firstly considered by the swedish astronomers charlier @xcite . moreover",
    ", this law coincides with the compton wavelength rule when we just consider a single particle , for instance an electron . by taking into account this generalization of compton wavelength rule",
    ", the model realizes a segregated universe , where the sizes of astrophysical structures can fit the observations ( e.g. cobe , iras , and surveys of large scale structures @xcite ) .",
    "the idea , that a rule can exist among the fundamental constants , was presented by dirac and by eddington  weinberg , but these rules were exact at universe scale or subatomic scale . here , a scale invariant rule is presented .",
    "thanks to this relation the universe appears self - similar and its self similarity is governed by fundamental quantum quantities , like the plank constant _ h _ , and relativistic constants , like the speed of light _",
    "c_.    it appears that the universe has a memory of its quantum origin as suggested by r.penrose with respect to quasi - crystal @xcite .",
    "particularly , it is related to penrose tiling and thus to @xmath3 theory ( cantorian space - time theory ) as proposed by m.s .",
    "el naschie @xcite,@xcite as well as in a.connes noncommutative geometry @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "some ideas are presented about the segregation of the universe . in particular , we analyze the scale invariant law @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the radius of the astrophysical structures , @xmath6 is the planck constant , @xmath7 is the total mass of the self - gravitating system , @xmath8 the speed of light , @xmath9 the number of nucleons into the structures and @xmath10 is linked with the golden mean .",
    "consequently , thanks to the virial theorem we deduce the gravitational constant @xmath11 and show that it is a function of the time and the matter in the universe ( trough the number of nucleons ) . here",
    "our expressions agree with the golden mean and with the gross law of fibonacci and lucas @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we will see the effects of a non constant g in stochastic self - similar universe .",
    "in particular , we analyze the cosmological density , the homogeneity of the universe , the implications coming from the hubble s law , the correlation function .",
    "we also deduce that a stocastic self - similar universe or equivalently an @xmath12 cantorian space - time naturally imply an accelerated universe .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we find the astrophysical scenario in sec.2 ; sec.3 presents a short review of definitions and properties for classic and stochastic self - similar random processes ; sec.4 is devoted to studying the effect of the virial theorem on the gravity parameter - constant @xmath11 ; in sec.5 we see how an accelerated universe comes from the hubble s law in the context of stochastic self - similar universe ; in sec.6 we analyze some fundamental consequences and finally conclusions are drawn in sec.7 .",
    "as it well known luminous matter appears segregated at different scale ; in particular , we can distinguish among globular clusters , galaxies , clusters and superclusters of galaxies through their spatial dimensions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that if we write : @xmath13 with @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16(this is approximately the number of nucleons in a galaxy ) , we reproduce exactly @xmath17 .    in general",
    ", we can evaluate the number of nucleons in a self - gravitating system as @xmath18 where @xmath9 is the number of nucleons of mass @xmath19 into self - gravitating system of total mass @xmath7 ; therefore we can neglect the mass of electrons . ] .",
    "then , we obtain the relevant results recalled in table 1 . in the second column the number of evaluated nucleons is shown , while we find the expected radius of self - gravitating system in the last column . @xmath20 by comparing the last column in table 1 with the observed values , we see a full agreement between the observed and theoretical radius . it is obvious that if we have only one constituent ( e.g. @xmath21 ) , like a proton or an electron , the relation ( 1 ) is the standard and well  known compton wavelength .",
    "consequently , as macroscopic system , our universe shows a sort of quantum and relativistic memory of its primordial phase .",
    "the choice to start with @xmath22 is suggested by statistical mechanics . by using ( 2 ) the eq.(1 ) is strictly equivalent to @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the relation ( 1 ) is the well  known random walk equation or brownian motion relation and it was firstly used by eddington @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we observed that @xmath22 is a too rough estimation if other interactions , in addition to gravity , are relevant .",
    "for this reason , we considered stochastic self - similar processes at atomic scale .",
    "these processes generalize the classic ones .",
    "it was shown that the nucleus scale is governed by a law like ( 1 ) but with a more complicated @xmath25 .    to determine the exact power law for astrophysical object , we consider the mass and the radius of objects as known quantities and evaluate the power law respect to the observed data .",
    "let us consider the relation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the quantity to be determined .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath28 where @xmath29 .    table 2 summarizes the results in respect to the objects in the length range @xmath30 and with a mass in the range @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 from table 2 , we note that , in the first approximation @xmath33 . as suggested by el naschie in various publications",
    "@xcite , this is also in a close agreement with the fibonacci s numbers and the golden mean .",
    "in fact , we can write    @xmath34    with @xmath35@xmath36 .    if we make the hypothesis that relation ( 3 ) is a universal law",
    ", then it has to be real at all scales .",
    "table 3 summarizes the results in respect to solar system objects .",
    "@xmath37 by considering table 3 we note the impressive constancy of @xmath38 for the planets of the solar system .",
    "the discrepancy of @xmath39 , in respect to the expected value @xmath40 , could be an effect of the planets not being a self  gravitating system .",
    "for the sun this discrepancy is a little bit worse than planets , probably due to not being a self  gravitating system and because of the effects of nuclear interactions in the interior of the sun .",
    "where @xmath41__h-.2em.2em__@xmath42 which is equivalent to ( 1 ) when @xmath43 then , at this scale , a stochastic self - similar process is more appropriate than a self - similar one ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , also in this case the relation can be considered as a recasting one of the golden mean or of the fibonacci s law . ] a similar approach was recently presented in @xcite ; also in this work the results reflect the cantorian - fractal structure of the space - time .",
    "let @xmath44 be real space and @xmath45 , then we define a self - similar ( ss ) random process for every @xmath46 @xmath47 where  @xmath48  denotes equality as distributions @xcite .",
    "the relation ( 5 ) is invariant under the group of positive affine transformations , @xmath49 since  @xmath50  satisfies the properties @xmath51 then it must have the form @xmath52 thanks to ( 8) the relation ( 5 ) becomes @xmath53 when a process satisfies ( 5 ) or ( 9 ) , it is said to be self - similar or @xmath54self - similar .",
    "a generalization of self - similar random process is obtained by replacing the deterministic scaling factor @xmath55 in ( 5 ) or ( 9 ) with a random variable @xmath56 .",
    "this variable is independent of the process to which such a variable is multiplied . then eq.(9 )",
    "becomes @xmath57 d.veneziano demonstrated in @xcite that @xmath58 can also be written as @xmath59 with @xmath60 real random variable .",
    "then , these kinds of processes , called stochastic self - similar ( sss ) random processes and the previous ones ( ss ) , can be treated in the same theory .",
    "gupta and waymire showed that for @xmath61 the sss processes are dilations , while for @xmath62 the sss processes are contractions @xcite,@xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the author proved the following relevant theorem : if @xmath63 for some @xmath64 then @xmath65 must be a deterministic constant @xmath66 then , one can treat ss and sss random processes in a unique scheme .",
    "moreover , the author gives many relevant properties and generalizations to a @xmath67-dimensional space in the same paper , but we are not going to consider these properties because they do not fit the objectives of our paper ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "presently it appears clear there is an agreement among ( 5 ) , ( 10 ) and ( 1 ) , ( 1 ) .",
    "in fact , by defining the deterministic scaling parameter @xmath68 , we find @xmath69 then our studies will explore a @xmath70-self - similar random aggregation process .    by considering electromagnetic and nuclear interactions , relation ( 10 )",
    "becomes    @xmath71    with @xmath72  a random variable . in principle , we have to expect a change from a deterministic scaling parameter @xmath73  to a random one @xmath74 , due to quantum treatment of nuclear and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "it is well known that the virial theorem can be formalized as    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the kinetic energy and @xmath77 the potential one .",
    "if we consider a test particle we have @xmath78 and @xmath79 ; consequently we obtain the well known expression to the speed    @xmath80    if we consider @xmath81 @xmath19 and @xmath82 by integrating on the range @xmath83 $ ] the following expression    @xmath84    where @xmath5 is the radius of the structure with mass @xmath7 , we easily obtain    @xmath85    with @xmath86    now if we impose that the previous expression is equal to the eq.(1 ) we obtain    @xmath87    where @xmath88 with @xmath89 . in other words g is a function of the time and the number of the constituents of the structures , i.e. @xmath90 . the value @xmath91 coincides with @xmath92 in the el naschie theory of cantorian fractal space - time . on the other hand , we can also consider the value @xmath93 connected with the golden mean and the cantorian fractal structure of the space - time . in this case",
    "we obtain the relation , @xmath94",
    "starting from the hubble s law    @xmath95    we get @xmath96    let us introduce the following parameter @xmath97    named in literature decelerating parameter . then we get    @xmath98    by considering a spherical volume with a radius @xmath99 ( @xmath100 is the radius of the universe ) , large enough to obtain a regular density , the gravitational force acting on an object posed on the spherical surface becomes    @xmath101    where @xmath7 is the mass which is inside the sphere .",
    "consequently by comparing the last two relation , we reach the result @xmath102    it coincides with the well known expression @xmath103 , when we consider @xmath104 ( the index 0 means at the present ) .",
    "we can evaluate the link between @xmath105 and @xmath11 as follows . by substituting the expression ( 14 ) for @xmath106 coming from the virial theorem in the hubble s law ( 18 ) ,",
    "we easily get    @xmath107    consequently by taking into account the relations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 16 ) , we obtain    @xmath108    with @xmath109 with @xmath24 . if we use ( 17 ) instead of ( 16 ) , we obtain @xmath110    by evaluating @xmath111 and using the relations(20 ) , ( 25),and ( 30 ) , we reach the result    @xmath112    if we use ( 26 ) instead of ( 25 ) , we obtain the following relation , which is linked with the golden mean @xmath113    the previous expressions suggest an accelerating universe in agreement with the observations .",
    "recent measurements of a type ia supernova ( sne ia ) , at redshift @xmath114 , indicate that the expansion of the present universe is accelerated @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in this sense",
    ", a stochastic self - similar and fractals universe could suggest the presence of dark energy pervasing the universe . in its simplest form , dark energy",
    "might well be einstein s cosmological constant in the form of a vacuum energy .",
    "on the other hand , recent theories have been proposed including the possibility of slowly evolving scalar fields ( see quintessence models in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "however the future results of snap collaboration ( supernova acceleration probe ) coming from space - telescope give us the amount of dark energy @xcite .    in conclusion when the observations convincingly demonstrated that the expansion of the universe is accelerated ,",
    "a number of theoretical investigations were started .",
    "most explanations suggested so far seem to belong to one of three categories : i ) assuming a nonzero cosmological constant @xcite,@xcite ; ii ) assuming a new scalar field quintessence @xcite,@xcite ; iii ) or assuming new gravitational physics . here",
    ", we demonstrated that by using the standard physics , that is the virial theorem and the hubble s law but on cantorian space - time @xmath12 , the same results can be achieved .",
    "we considered the compton wavelength expression as a particular case of a more general relation , which is true for all material structures in the universe .",
    "we discovered a fundamental relation which demonstrates the self - similarity of the universe .",
    "the relations ( 1 ) or ( 3 ) show a universe that has memory of its quantum and relativistic nature at all scales . in this sense ,",
    "the plank constant and the speed of light play a fundamental role in giving a quantum and relativistic parameterization of the structures .",
    "this reveals why the astrophysical structures and organic matter have their particular lengths @xcite . in what follows",
    "we analyze the consequences coming from the law ( 3 ) or ( 3 ) and the relation ( 16 ) or ( 17 ) .",
    "the presented scale invariant law can be used to evaluate the baryonic mass of the universe . from ( 1 ) ( with @xmath22 ) we have @xmath116 which corresponds to a number of nucleons of @xmath117 in the previous evaluation we considered a universe with @xmath118 m. let us introduce the critical density @xmath119    evaluated with @xmath120 @xmath6 km s@xmath121mpc@xmath121(where @xmath122 .    clearly",
    "the approximation of a spherical universe is too rough .",
    "the self similarity of relation ( 3 ) or ( 3 ) , and the exponent equal to 3/2 are the two fundamental ingredients of fractal geometry .",
    "the scale invariant law lives in a fractal domain .    therefore , the universe has fractal dimension .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite we can define the fractal dimension as following @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the number of nucleons inside the radius @xmath5 and @xmath5 is the radius of the structure .",
    "thanks to ( 32 ) , we can estimate the fractal dimensions of all astrophysical structure and of the universe too .",
    "table 4 summarizes these results .",
    "@xmath125    from table 4 it is very interesting to note a relative coincidence of the fractal dimension of the universe with the number @xmath126 .",
    "taking into account the result @xmath127 it suggests a universe whose spatial bound permeates the time dimension .",
    "if we also consider the time , then @xmath128 theoretically speaking by assuming the limitation of measurement accuracy the previous value can be the hausdorff dimension , found by el naschie @xcite    @xmath129    on the other hand the value in ( 34 ) is also near to the continuous @xmath130 distribution formula for @xmath12 ; in this case we obtain @xmath131 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that @xmath132 , which is connected with the fine structure constant , i.e    @xmath133    as determined by el naschie in @xcite .",
    "consequently , the density of the universe is : @xmath134 which is evaluated in the hypothesis of a spatial pseudo - sphere universe ( see fig.3 ) . a similar result can be reach by using a different approach based on the limit set of klenian groups @xcite",
    ". therefore , @xmath135 indicates an open universe , i.e. the gravitational interaction is not sufficient to reverse the expansion of the universe into a contraction .",
    "this conclusion fully agrees with the present observations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "moreover , the cosmological density results in @xmath136 we may mention at this point that el naschie in @xcite , @xcite used the dimensionless gravity constant @xmath11 to establish a shanon - like entropy    @xmath137    where @xmath138  is the coupling constant at the higgs - electroweak in order to establish quantum gravity .",
    "the figures 1 - 2 show some examples of a pseudo - sphere universe      the homogeneity of the universe is also connected with the self - similarity and with the parameter @xmath22 . if we consider a constant number of galaxies per unit of volume , the total number of galaxies @xmath9 along a direction and at distance @xmath139 grows like @xmath140 .",
    "consequently , by considering the galaxies with an intrinsic luminosity @xmath141 the apparent luminosity @xmath142 , that is measured on the earth , is    @xmath143    then @xmath144 and so    @xmath145    this result is in agreement with the observation @xcite .",
    "the radio - sources and quasars appear in disagreement  with the previous result in ( 39 ) and suggest a greater value which tends to 1.6 .",
    "for this reason we can suspect and propose    @xmath146    and consider ( 39 ) an approximation of the real value ( 40 ) linked with the golden mean @xmath147 .",
    "it is well known that if we apply the virial theorem to a generic distribution of galaxies with a correlation function @xmath148 , we obtain the cosmic virial theorem , that is    @xmath149    where @xmath150 . in particular , by considering a constant mass density @xmath151 on a spherical region , @xmath152 .",
    "the correlation function has a power law with the exponent @xmath153 ,    @xmath154    where for istance @xmath155 mpc when @xmath156 mpc @xcite , and @xmath157 mpc when @xmath158 mpc @xcite .",
    "the relevant exponent @xmath159 can be derived from @xmath3 space - time .",
    "in fact , @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the golden mean .",
    "moreover , @xmath162 , where @xmath163 was invoked for obtaining the dimensionless constant of gravity @xmath164 by el naschie @xcite .",
    "we mention that starting from the expression    @xmath165    and by considering the ( 17 ) we obtain a time dependent @xmath166 , that is    @xmath167    another interesting link between the golden mean and the stochastic self - similar universe is the following one . in the context of the velocity of our galaxy with respect to the microwave radiation background , as showed by peebles in @xcite , by applying the perturbation theory we can demonstrated that the velocity perturbation is proportional to the excess of the mass density @xmath151 in the virgin cluster , that is    @xmath168    again the exponent @xmath169 suggest the golden mean @xmath161 as possibly nearest value .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effect of a stochastic self - similar and fractal universe on some physical quantities and relations . by using the virial theorem and the proposed scale invariant law",
    ", we derived the time dependence of @xmath11 .",
    "we verify the agreement between the theoretical value of the cosmological constant coming from the presented stochastic self - similar universe and the observed one .",
    "also the homogeneity of the universe appears in connection with the present law . also using the virial theorem , the evaluated @xmath170 and the hubble s law we found an accelerating universe similar to what has shown by the recent observations on the sne ia .",
    "in addition , the exponent of the correlation function can be explained in the context of the stochastic self - similar universe , equivalently as in el naschie @xmath12 cantorian space - time .",
    "our model allows us to realize an actual segregated universe according to the observations .",
    "thanks to the relation @xmath171 , we have a link between the actual universe , as observed , and its primordial phase , when quantum and relativistic laws were in comparison with gravity .    relation ( 3 )",
    "appears interesting not only because it allows us to obtain the exact dimensions of self - gravitating systems , but it is scale invariant .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observations on the large  scale structures and the random walk relation suggest @xmath172 as best value ( in agreement with el naschie s @xmath173-infinity cantorian space - time , the golden mean and the fibonacci numbers ) .",
    "all these results confirm the fractality of power law ( 1 ) , which tends to be a more like a general theory . in a certain sense",
