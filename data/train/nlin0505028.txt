    "many nonlinear dissipative systems that are driven sufficiently far away from thermal equilibrium show selforganization out of an unstructured state : a structured one can appear that is characterized by a ( spatially extended ) pattern which retains some of the symmetries of the system @xcite .",
    "convection in binary miscible fluids like ethanol - water , @xmath0he @xmath1he , or various gas mixtures is an example of such systems .",
    "it shows rich and interesting pattern formation behavior and it is paradigmatic for problems related to instabilities , bifurcations , and selforganization with complex spatiotemporal behavior .",
    "compared to convection in one - component fluids like , e.g. , pure water the spatiotemporal properties are far more complex .",
    "the reason is that concentration variations which are generated via thermodiffusion , i.e. , the soret effect by externally imposed and by internal temperature gradients influence the buoyancy , i.e. , the driving force for convective flow .",
    "the latter in turn mixes by advectively redistributing concentration .",
    "this nonlinear advection gets in developed convective flow typically much larger than the smoothening by linear diffusion  pclet numbers measuring the strength of advective concentration transport relative to diffusion are easily @xmath2(1000 ) .",
    "thus , the concentration balance is strongly nonlinear giving rise to strong variations of the concentration field and to boundary layer behavior .",
    "in contrast to that , momentum and heat balances remain weakly nonlinear close to onset as in pure fluids implying only smooth and basically harmonic variations of velocity and temperature fields as of the critical modes .    without the thermodiffusive soret coupling between temperature and concentration any initial concentration deviation from the mean diffuses away and",
    "influences no longer the balances of the other fields .",
    "hence , the feedback interplay between ( _ i _ ) the soret generated concentration variations , ( _ ii _ ) the resulting modified buoyancy , and ( _ iii _ ) the strongly nonlinear advective transport and mixing causes binary mixture convection to be rather complex with respect to its spatiotemporal properties and its bifurcation behavior .",
    "take for example the case of negative soret coupling , @xmath3 , between temperature and concentration fields @xcite when the lighter component migrates to the colder regions thereby stabilizing the density stratification in the quiescent , laterally homogeneous conductive fluid state .",
    "then the above described feedback interplay generates oscillations .",
    "in fact the buoyancy difference in regions with different concentrations was identified already in @xcite as the cause for traveling wave convection .",
    "oscillatory convection appears in the form of the transient growth of convection at supercritical heating , in spatially extended nonlinear traveling wave ( tw ) and standing wave solutions that branch in general subcritically out of the conductive state via a common hopf bifurcation , in spatially localized traveling wave ( ltw ) states , and in various types of fronts .",
    "tw and ltw convection has been studied experimentally and theoretically for some time @xcite .",
    "the transient oscillatory growth of convection was investigated by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "nonlinear standing wave solutions were obtained only recently @xcite . freely propagating convection fronts that connect subcritically bifurcating nonlinear tw convection with the _ stable _ quiescent",
    "fluid do not seem to have been investigated in detail beyond some first preliminary results @xcite .",
    "here we determine such fronts in quantitative detail and compare their properties with those of ltws .",
    "in narrow rectangular and annular channels convection occurs in the form of rolls with axes oriented perpendicular to the long sidewalls @xcite .",
    "these stuctures can efficiently be described in the two dimensional vertical @xmath4 cross section in the middle of the channel perpendicular to the roll axes ignoring variations in axis direction .",
    "furthermore , these convection structures have relevant phase gradients only in @xmath5-direction thus causing effectively one dimensional patterns @xcite .    when comparing experiments with analytical calculations or numerical simulations performed under the above described conditions it is useful to do that on the basis of reduced rayleigh numbers , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the critical one for onset of pure fluid convection for the respective experiment , analytical method , or numerical method .",

    "localized traveling waves . _ for weak negative soret coupling one has observed in experiments a competition between homogeneous laterally extended tw convection and so - called dispersive chaos with an irregular repetitive formation and collapse of spatially localized tw pulses @xcite . during the pulse formation their drift velocities can drop abruptly to about a tenth of the initial group velocity @xcite .",
    "we consider this to be a characteristic signal that the lateral redistribution of concentration over the pulse @xcite becomes important and that the strongly nonlinear dynamics sets in . for more negative @xmath8 the collapse",
    "is in general less dramatic .",
    "there , convection is dominated by isolated strongly peaked localized states .",

    "increasing the soret coupling strength further to more negative @xmath10 the band ( @xmath11 ) of rayleigh numbers in which stable ltws exist increases monotonically while shifting upwards as a whole  @xmath12 grows stronger than @xmath13 .",
    "simultaneosly , the lower band limit for the existence of extended tw states @xmath14 , i.e. , the lowest saddle - node of tws increases even steeper so that eventually for @xmath15 the complete ltw band comes to lie below the existence range of tws , @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "the latter is a function of @xmath19 with magnitude much smaller than the phase velocities .",
    "also the oscillation frequency of the ltw is uniquely selected ; it is constant in space and time in the frame that is comoving with its drift velocity . and finally , the length @xmath20 of the convective region of stable ltws and their spatial stucture are uniquely selected .",
    "this length grows with increasing heating @xmath21 .",
    "a central role for the stable existence of ltws plays a large - scale mean concentration current . extending over the whole ltw it redistributes concentration and thereby changes the buoyancy in a decisive way @xcite .",
    "this effect can sustain ltws even at low @xmath21 where no extended tws exist @xcite .    _ blinking states in rectangular channels . _",
    "the ltw confinement of convection occurring in translationally invariant annular channels is obviously an inherent process of the hydrodynamic balances .",
    "but one has also observed end - wall - assisted or at least end - wall - modified confinement of convection close to the ends of rectangular channels .",
    "the weakly nonlinear varieties of such a confinement can largely be understood in terms of the convective behavior of tw packets , their reflection properties at the end walls , and the destructive interaction between left and right traveling patterns @xcite .",
    "these effects give rise near onset to a wide range of weakly nonlinear and effectively low dimensional spatiotemporal behavior that depends sensitively on the specific experimental set - up like , e.g. , the end - wall boundary conditions and the system length @xcite . while the linear eigenmodes of such sytems ( linear counterpropagating waves or chevrons ) @xcite are laterally symmetric or antisymmetric localization sets in via a temporal amplitude modulation .",
    "thereby convection is alternatingly weakened and enhanced in the left and the right part of the system part giving rise to a blinking state @xcite .",
    "the so - called chaotic blinking states @xcite seem to be the analogue of the chaotic dispersive pulse formation in annular containers @xcite .",
    "also blinking modes with different frequencies at both ends of the channel were observed @xcite .",

    "the more extensive wall - attached structures show some similarities with front - like states .",

    "then we present results for the two different types of tw front states that can arise in laterally homogeneous mirror symmetric systems with either the phase propagating out of the quiescent fluid or into it .",

    "[ sec : ltw ] deals with ltw states and their relation to fronts .",
    "the transient dynamics towards the selected ltw , the stabilization via front repulsion , the difference between long and short ltws , and a critical appraisal of ltw models are topics covered here . in sec .",
    "[ sec : compare - exp ] we present a comparison with experiments and a discussion .",
    "the last section contains a conclusion .",
    "here we discuss front solutions where part of the system is occupied by the quiescent fluid while the other one shows fully developed , saturated , strongly nonlinear tw convection with laterally homogeneous amplitude . strictly speaking these two states",
    "are realized only in the two opposing limits of @xmath54 .",
    "we focus our investigation of fronts on parameters where the quiescent fluid state is stable and where the tw solutions bifurcate subcritically out of the conductive state .",
    "then , any _ linear _ growing and spreading of infinitesimal , localized convective perturbations in the quiescent fluid which could possibly dominate the low amplitude behavior of fronts as in the case of an unstable zero amplitude state @xcite is absent .    little general is known about pattern forming fronts in real bistable systems @xcite .",
    "most of the research activities were centered on fronts in the quintic ginzburg - landau equation @xcite .",
    "one can expect that the front properties are fixed by a strongly nonlinear eigenvalue problem describing a heteroclinic orbit between the two involved states",
    ". some of these front solutions will be unstable",
    ". there might be also multistable coexistence of fronts so that depending on initial conditions and on the history of the ( control ) parameters different fronts could finally be realized .",
    "we call a front uniquely selected when our numerical simulations indicated that different formation processes ended in the same front for a fixed parameter combination .",
    "fronts can be classified into coherent and incoherent ones @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the first kind which in our system are characterized as strictly time periodic states in a frame that is comoving with the front s velocity @xmath55 .",
    "such a front state being monochromatic is a global nonlinear mode .",
    "its frequency is an eigenvalue , i.e. , a global constant in space and time so that the convection oscillations have everywhere the same period .",
    "thus , we do not consider here , e.g. , complex large scale or chaotic spatiotemporal interface behavior .",
    "the coherent fronts of the various hydrodynamic fields and quantities in this paper have a smooth and basically monotonous profile which connects the quiescent fluid with the nonlinear saturated extended tw .",
    "the transition region between conduction and convection that is characterized by large amplitude variations is quite short and consists typically only of about 3 -4 convection rolls .",
    "we call this transition region also the interface between conduction and convection .    if the selected front pattern is incompatible with any stable bulk structure there are two possibilities : ( _ i _ ) a perturbation in the unstable convection bulk grows and expands towards the interface",
    ". this would destroy front coherence and could lead to more complex large scale variations , perhaps chaotic spatiotemporal behavior .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the interface region is only convectively unstable against perturbations of the bulk nonlinear tw .",
    "then initially localized perturbations would be advected out of every finite system and could not reach the unperturbed interface region of the front .",
    "we call a front to be of type @xmath56 when its envelope grows at @xmath57 out of the basic quiescent state .",
    "otherwise it is a @xmath58front .",
    "then the amplitude falls to zero at @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the phase of the convection pattern in a front state of type @xmath56 can either propagate to the left or to the right and similarly for the @xmath58front state .",
    "hence , one would have to discuss four front states separately .",
    "however , because of the invariance of the system under @xmath60 a @xmath56front state with positive ( negative ) phase velocity @xmath61 is the mirror image of the @xmath58front state with negative ( positive ) @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , it suffices to consider only the front states that consist of roll vortices traveling , say , in positive @xmath5-direction and to use the superscript @xmath56 or @xmath58 to identify the properties of the front in question in a unique way .",
    "so , the phase velocities of all oscillatory convective structures investigated in this paper are positive .",
    "we call the direction of positive @xmath5 into which the phase propagates also downstream and the opposite one upstream.    so , to sum up our notation : in a @xmath56front state the quiescent fluid is located upstream and a source of phase with the latter propagating out of the conductive state into convection . in a @xmath58front the quiescent fluid is located in downstream direction and a sink since phase moves out of convection into conduction .    fig .",
    "[ fig : frontpics ] shows fronts of each type . under the @xmath56front ( left half of fig .",
    "[ fig : frontpics ] ) convection rolls grow out of the quiescent fluid and saturate in a downstream bulk tw .",

    "[ fig : frontpics ] that the quiescent ( convecting ) region expands into the convecting ( quiescent ) one when the velocity @xmath62 of the @xmath56front is positive ( negative ) and vice versa for the @xmath58front .      in order to monitor",
    "how well the fluid is mixed along the front we always determined for the relaxed front states the mixing number @xmath63^{1/2}\\ ] ] as a function of lateral position @xmath5 .",
    "it basically measures the mean square of the deviations @xmath64 of the concentration field from its global mean : the overbars imply a vertical average and the brackets a temporal average at the specific horizontal location @xmath5 in the frame comoving with the front velocity @xmath55 .",
    "the subscript _ cond _ denotes the reference quiescent conductive state with its linear vertical concentation variation .",
    "the mixing number is defined such that @xmath65 in a perfectly mixed fluid and @xmath66 in the quiescent state .    in laterally extended tws @xmath67 and with it",
    "@xmath61 increase when the concentration variations become larger @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is a universal scaling relation between @xmath68 and @xmath67 @xcite which shows that @xmath68 and @xmath61 are linearly related to each other .",
    "this relation also holds for the bulk part of front states far away from the interface where the convection is tw - like with only slow spatial amplitude variation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : frontpics ] ) .      the phase shift between the concentration and velocity waves in the tw - like bulk of the front states sustains as in extended tw states a mean lateral concentration current @xmath69 @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the velocity field and @xmath38 the temperature deviation from the global mean .",
    "again , the brackets imply a temporal average in the frame that is comoving with the front velocity .",
    "the lewis number @xmath52 being rather small in our simulations implies that @xmath72 is dominated by the advective contribution except in those boundary regions in which @xmath71 becomes small .",
    "the vertical variation of @xmath72 is such that positive ( negative ) @xmath39 is transported in phase direction in the upper ( lower ) half of the layer .",
    "this transport causes a large - scale concentration redistribution in a front state between its tw bulk and its interface to the quiescent fluid and it is responsible for the different characteristic structures of the interfaces in a @xmath56 and a @xmath58front as we will see further below .",
    "we simulated systems containing up to 160 rolls .",
    "the initial state was prepared by filling one half of the sytem with a nonlinear tw that was previously generated with periodic boundaries to have some fixed wavelength @xmath73 .",
    "the other half contained the stable temperature and concentration distribution of the pure quiescent basic state .    to simulate @xmath56fronts in infinite systems that connect to developed tw convection with some wavelength @xmath73 far away from the interface between conduction and convection we imposed at the downstream boundary @xmath74 of our computation domain the periodicity condition @xmath75 .",
    "for the case of @xmath58fronts we found that imposing the analogous condition at the upstream boundary of the developed tw part at @xmath76 typically will introduce perturbations that can grow in downstream direction for example when the tw region is eckhaus unstable .",
    "the different aspects of the stability of @xmath56 and @xmath58fronts are discussed further below in the paper .    after a relaxation time of typically 100 to 200 vertical thermal diffusion times",
    "we then could observe under certain conditions a coherent front state connecting a quiescent region of the system to a tw with asymptotic wavelength @xmath73 . here",
    "the fact that the frequency @xmath67 of such a coherent front state is constant in space and time in the frame that is comoving with the front velocity @xmath55 proved to be a good relaxation criterion to effectively determine whether such a state had been obtained .        as soon as the growing convection rolls in a @xmath56front have become sufficiently nonlinear , i.e. , when their lateral flow velocity @xmath77 has grown up to about their phase velocity @xmath61 [ e.g. , close to the vertical arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : frontpics](c ) ] they start to alternatingly suck in positive ( blue ) and negative ( red ) @xmath39 from the top and bottom concentration boundary layers , respectively .",
    "it is transported away into the well mixing convection bulk and replaced at the interface location by neutral ( yellow / green ) @xmath39 .",
    "note that increasing @xmath77 beyond @xmath61 causes the appearence of closed streamlines of the velocity field in the frame comoving with the phase velocity of a traveling roll @xcite .",
    "these closed streamlines regions are responsible for the characteristic roll structure of the @xmath78 field in fig .",
    "[ fig : frontpics](a ) : positive ( negative ) @xmath39 is collected from the top ( bottom ) boundary layers and transported within the homogeneously mixed closed streamline regions in phase direction while mean concentration , @xmath79 , is advected along the meandering `` green - yellow stripe '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : frontpics](a ) to the left @xcite .",
    "the mean concentration current @xmath72 resulting from this complicated concentration redistribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : frontpics](i ) .",
    "all in all , mean concentration is accumulated ( depleted ) at the @xmath56 ( @xmath58 ) front interface .",
    "the concentration redistribution reduces at the interface of the @xmath56front the soret - induced solutal stabilization that occurs to the left of it as a result of the large conductive vertical concentration gradient : at the interface one can observe a minimal mixing number [ fig .  [ fig : frontpics](e ) ] and with it a buoyancy overshoot [ fig .",
    "[ fig : frontpics](g ) ] which is sufficiently large to sustain local convection growth there and cause even invasion of convection into the quiescent region whenever @xmath80 . with the fluid being well mixed there ,",
    "i.e. , with @xmath68 being small the local phase velocity is also small there  in fact the minimum of @xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ fig : frontpics](e ) lies close to the one in @xmath68 .",
    "since the strongly stable quiescent fluid to the left of the @xmath56front prohibits a well developed advectively mixing front tail the reduction of @xmath39 variations there is driven primarily by diffusion .",
    "the latter having a characteristic time scale given by @xmath52 explains why the front velocities are much smaller than the fast phase velocity .",
    "when @xmath21 is increased @xmath81 tends to become ( more ) negative : convection to the right of the @xmath56interface can now , with increased heating , better invade the quiescent fluid to the left of it and thus @xmath82 .",
    "similarly , when @xmath10 is increased , i.e. , when the convection suppressing soret effect is diminished the expansion of tw convection is favoured and thus @xmath83 .    moving along the @xmath56front in fig .",
    "[ fig : frontpics ] to the right from the interface towards the asymptotic tw state at large @xmath5 there develops an equilibrium between the @xmath39 feed - in from the boundary layers at the plates and the amount of advective mixing : the concentration contrast between two neighboring rolls increases on the way towards the tw bulk . with it the phase speed @xmath17 , the wavelength @xmath84 , and the lateral concentration current @xmath72 grow monotonously up to their asymptotic tw values .",
    "this growth extends laterally over a wide interval which itself increases when the soret coupling becomes stronger .",
    "we found that the minimal wavelength in a @xmath56front state is located at the interface and  more remarkably  that it is about @xmath85 for _ all @xmath21 and @xmath10 _ that we have simulated .",
    "we have no real quantitative explanation for this strong universal selection of the local wavelength at the interface .",
    "intuitively the growing rolls are squeezed in the region with the negative lateral gradient of @xmath68 .",
    "the squeezing is relaxed when the rolls begin to absorb high concentration contrasts from the plate layers which increases @xmath61 again [ arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : frontpics](c ) ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mean concentration current @xmath72 of tws becomes maximal close to the tw saddle node , i.e. , where the asymptotic tw parts of our front states are located .",
    "finally we mention that the front states do not sustain a measurable lateral meanflow ; the quiescent fluid prohibits that . on the other hand ,",
    "extended tws in laterally periodic systems show in general a reynolds stress - induced meanflow of the order @xmath86 @xcite .",

    "@xcite which showed the important role of the concentration field for a ltw riecke @xcite proposed an extension of the ginzburg - landau equations . within a weakly nonlinear expansion he coupled into the standard cgle as an additional slow variable the amplitude @xmath153 of an advected mean large - scale concentration mode that influences the growth of the critical modes .",
    "a similar idea was advanced already by glazier _",
    "the extension can induce an additional amplitude - intability of phase winding solutions to modulated waves .",
    "it may be considered as the origin for pulse formation in this ansatz @xcite .",
    "riecke showed that the influence of the real @xmath153-mode alone on the local growth rate ( without dispersion ) suffices to generate slowly drifting stable pulse solutions even below a supercritical tw - bifurcation @xcite . in this way he modelled a new localization mechanism to explain the robust occurrence of ltws in binary mixture convection .",
    "the amplitude @xmath153 can be interpreted as a measure for the local mixing state or the mean convection - induced deviation of the vertical concentration gradient from the conductive one . in this way",
    "his extended complex ginzburg - landau equation ( ecgle ) contains in a sketchy way physical effects like the mixing influence on the growth rate and the large - scale concentration redistribution .",
    "riecke characterized within his model short and long ltws as dispersion - dominated pulses @xcite and states of two fronts that are bounded by the @xmath153 dynamics @xcite , respectively .",
    "he proposed an explanation for their coexistence in stable and unstable form , respectively , by the competition between dispersion - dominated and @xmath153-dominated localization @xcite .",
    "note , however , that in contrast to the model used by riecke our results show stable long ltws that drift either in or opposite to the direction of phase propagation depending on paramters .",
    "it would be interesting to check whether adding a term of the form @xmath154 to the @xmath153-equation can stabilize forward drifting long pulses within the model since it models the concentration wake , i.e. , the transport of the local mixing state in phase direction by the traveling rolls of amplitude @xmath155 .",
    "numerical and analytical investigations of the ecgle predict a hysteretic transition from slow to fast drifting pulses or the existence of oscillatory moving ones @xcite .",
    "but both were never seen in experiments or simulations .",
    "thus , despite their capability in elucidating some essential mechanisms cgle type models have the drawback so far that they reproduce only single aspects of ltws in a qualitative manner .",
    "their range of validity and their predictive power is not well known . and",
    "since a satisfactory relation with the full field equations has not been established these models remain somewhat arbitrary .",
    "it appears questionable that weakly nonlinear expansions with spatially slowly varying mode amplitudes are approriate at all in view of the very large pclet numbers , @xmath2(1000 ) , measuring the strength of the nonlinearity in the concentration balance .",
    "thus , so far numerical simulations of the full field equations seem to be the appropriate tool besides careful experiments to gather insight into the specific physical mechanisms for ltw formation in binary mixture convection .",
    "an inspection of figs .",
    "[ fig : psi25v+om+k - r ] , [ fig:3psisv+l+w - r ] , and [ fig : phasediagram ] shows that the lower band limit @xmath149 for the existence of short ltws and the crossing value , @xmath156 , where the velocities of free fronts become equal approach each other when @xmath157 decreases .",
    "thus , one can foresee an interval of moderately negative @xmath10 where short and long ltws can be found close to @xmath145 . in this case",
    "the upper band limit for the existence of stable ltws should be defined by a backward saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath158 where the branches of stable short and unstable long ltws annihilate each other .",
    "hence , we expect that the upper parts of the bifurcation diagrams of @xmath90 versus @xmath21 in the inset of figs .",
    "[ fig : psi25v+om+k - r ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig:3psisv+l+w - r](b ) curve backwards towards smaller @xmath21 when @xmath157 decreases further below the values of the two figures . in this way",
    "the shape of the curve @xmath159 would change continuously from the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l - r - scheme](b ) to the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : l - r - scheme](a ) .",
    "the former shows schematically the bifurcation behavior of @xmath159 that we have determined numerically for @xmath160 .",
    "in fact , at @xmath10 slightly larger than -0.25 we expect the appearence of the saddle - node in the curves @xmath159 .",
    "[ fig : l - r - scheme](a ) is a schematic representation of experimental results of kolodner @xcite for @xmath161 as presented in his fig .",
    "he stabilized by an adaptive heating mechanism long unstable ltws in coexistence with short stable ones .",
    "thus , the unstable ltw solution branch [ dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : l - r - scheme](a ) ] forms for @xmath162 a separatrix between the domains of attraction of expanding two - front structures to the right of the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : l - r - scheme](a ) and the domain to the left of the dashed line leading to stable narrow pulses or the basic state .",
    "furthermore , small ltws that are prepared at @xmath163 will evolve into expanding two - front structures when @xmath21 is increased above @xmath158 .",
    "note that in kolodner s experiment @xcite done at @xmath161 the upper band limit @xmath158 of ltws lies _ above _ the hopf bifurcation threshold @xmath164 for extended tws where perturbations of the quiescent fluid can grow .",
    "therefore , one has to address there questions related to linear and nonlinear convective versus absolute instability @xcite , to linearly selected so - called pulled fronts versus nonlinearly selected so - called pushed fronts @xcite , and to the robustness and stability of nonlinear fronts under emission or absorption of tw perturbations that can grow in the region occupied by the quiescent fluid .      for stronger negative @xmath10 the measured ltw properties",
    "agree qualitatively well with our results .",
    "for example , the arbitrary - width confined states found in experiments @xcite for @xmath165 at a single rayleigh number are to be identified as two - front structures .",
    "a quantitative comparison is difficult due to the difference in the boundary conditions : we simulated two - dimensional convection assuming translational symmetry in @xmath166-direction while the narrow experimental convection channels impose no - slip conditions at the walls perpendicular to the roll axes . there are three effects that account for the difference beteen experiments and simulations .    first , the characteristic rayleigh numbers in the experiments are higher .",
    "this is already known from the suppression of oscillatory or steady convection instabilities in narrow channels @xcite .",
    "the no - slip conditions at the side - walls generate a nontrivial @xmath166-variation of the velocity field that introduces additional internal friction and that has to be compensated by a higher heating rate @xcite .",
    "second , the ltw drift velocities in the experiment have the global tendency to lie below those of the simulations .",
    "for example , for @xmath165 the experimental ltws @xcite move opposite to the phase velocity whereas according to our calculations @xmath18 should be around @xmath167 .",
    "again , we attribute this difference to the fact that we neglect gradients in @xmath166-direction .",
    "they change the concentration redistribution dynamics in particular at the @xmath56interface of the ltw which determines the drift velocity . in this context",
    "one has to note that already weak inhomogeneities in a convection cell can slow down and even pin the ltw movement @xcite .",
    "finally , the influence of the different boundaries on the frequencies , phase velocities , and wave numbers of confined states are totally unknown .    also when comparing quantitatively our results for fronts with experiments one should take into account the above discussed points .",
    "extrapolating our results for the front velocities to more negative @xmath10 beyond @xmath142 we see that already at the lowest tw saddle location @xmath168 two - front stuctures would expand with @xmath169 .",
    "in other words , the velocity crossing point @xmath88 is no longer above @xmath168 but has virtually moved below the lowest tw saddle location where in fact no fronts exist . on the other hand , ltws still exist in this @xmath21-range with length increasing with @xmath21 .",
    "however , @xmath159 does not seem to diverge anymore as for @xmath170 which is compatible with the absence of fronts moving with the same velocity .",
    "laterally confined convection patches of traveling rolls were found in the early experiments @xcite that were done in narrow rectangular convection channels in the form of so - called wall - attached confined structures ( wacs ) .",
    "they were localized near one of the short end walls closing the channel .",
    "these wacs can be understood with our knowledge of fronts and free ltws .",
    "for example , for the weakly negative @xmath10 used in the early experiments the phase velocity of the wacs was directed towards the wall to which they were attached . indeed , for such parameters mainly short ltws occur with drift velocities in phase direction so that they would end as wacs of the above described type in finite length channels .",
    "furthermore , the measured wacs profiles of phase velocity @xmath17 , of wavelength @xmath87 , and their decrease of frequency with increasing @xmath21 @xcite agree qualitatively with the typical behavior of free short ltws .",
    "the connection between wacs and free ltws was more explicitly demonstrated by kolodner @xcite for more negative separation ratios @xmath171 and @xmath172 : he prepared a free ltw pulse with large phase velocity ( a fast confined state in his terminology ) which drifted slowly opposite to the direction of phase propagation towards an end wall of the convection channel and became there a wacs ( a slow confined state in his terminology ) with lower phase velocity being directed away from the wall . in this",
    "wacs the phase generating trailing front , i.e. , the analogue of the @xmath56interface is pinned at the wall and therefore without solutal gradients to the quiescent fluid as in a free ltw .",
    "the absence of these concentration variations at the @xmath56interface implies and allows a lateral concentration redistribution over the whole state at lower levels of the mixing number @xmath68 in wacs as compared to free ltws .",
    "consequently , the phase velocities and frequencies of wacs are smaller than those of the respective free ltws .",
    "a less dramatic drop of frequency was observed also between forward drifting ltws and short wacs at @xmath173 @xcite .    due to their better mixing capability ,",
    "i.e. , smaller @xmath68 it is very probable that short wacs can exist for heating rates below the lower band limit @xmath149 of stable ltw pulses  at least in the case where the phase velocity is directed away from the wall .",
    "it would be very interesting to test this conjecture experimentally , in particular for strongly negative @xmath10 .",
    "there @xmath149 itself lies already well below the range of stable tws @xcite and so the wacs would lie even lower . an inportant hint that this conjecture is right is given by ning _",
    "they have performed two - dimensional simulations of a finite - length convection channel with realistic boundary conditions for @xmath174 , and @xmath52 .",
    "neglecting the slight difference in @xmath175 their results should be comparable with our work .",
    "they found short wacs at @xmath176 which is according to our results far below the tw saddle nodes for this separation ratio and also below the lower band limit @xmath149 of free ltws for @xmath177 .",
    "however , these authors claim  we think , incorrectly  that their wacs lie above the saddle - node location @xmath93 of extended tws .      in the previous section",
    "we have shown that the @xmath56interface where the convection rolls grow in downstream direction out of the quiescent fluid plays the dominant role for the stability of ltws . while the @xmath58interface where the decaying rolls are advected into the quiescent fluid does not play a decisive role .",
    "this is clearly confirmed in pulse collision experiments @xcite .",
    "fast tw pulses  linear ones with small amplitude as well as nonlinear ones with larger amplitude  were completely absorbed by a ltw when the pulses hit the @xmath58interface of the ltw , i.e. , when the pulse velocity is directed opposite to and towards the phase velocity of the ltw .",
    "then the collision with the pulse affects only the @xmath58interface itself and perturbations are quickly advected out of the ltw and do not propagate upstream towards the @xmath56interface . for the same reason double - ltw states of two counter propagating waves can persist over a long time @xcite or even be stable @xcite .",
    "moreover , a pair of ltws that have their phase propagation directed towards each other and that interact with each other via their decay interfaces is seen to be stable over a substantially wider @xmath21-range than two ltw pulses which are connected at their growth interfaces @xcite .",
    "obviously the latter case is more critical for the structural integrity of the involved ltws .",
    "a ltw is most likely destroyed when another wave with the same direction of phase propagation infiltrates its phaseflow at the growth region .",
    "then , while growing the perturbations can be transmitted into the strongly nonlinear bulk part of the ltw and can destroy its coherence .",
    "the different selection and stability properties of the @xmath56 and @xmath58interfaces were already observed in transient convection behavior in various experiments ( see for example @xcite ) , however without further investigation .",
    "the fact that ( @xmath178 ) different @xmath58fronts with different bulk tw parts are possible as stable coexisting states and that ( @xmath179 ) a @xmath56front interface is in general stable against downflow perturbations opens the possibility for another kind of stable long confined tws : therein rolls with low wavelength grow out of the quiescent fluid in a normal growth part . in the bulk",
    "an incoherent phase front connects this fast wave that is coming from the @xmath56interface with a slow wave of higher wavelength and larger amplitude via spatiotemporal dislocations as , e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ fig : irregularfront ] .",
    "the transition could take place via one or more intermediate convection states .",
    "eventually this slow tw convection undergoes a decay transition into the basic state via a coherent @xmath58interface .",
    "such defected confined states are indeed observed in annular containers @xcite and were studied by kolodner @xcite .",
    "he found such structures only for @xmath180 .",
    "one may speculate that for these separation ratios the bulk tw that is selected by and behind the @xmath56interface is absolutely unstable against the slow wave in the further downstream part .",
    "this could explain the existence of persistent roll pair annihilations without the need of fluctuations .",
    "we finally mention that the occurrence of phase annihilating dislocations between a growth part and the downstream convection was observed for moderately negative @xmath10 already in narrow rectangular containers @xcite .",
    "furthermore , end - wall induced eckhaus instabilities of downstream tw states have been seen in simulations @xcite .",
    "for parameters where the conductive quiescent fluid is stable and where spatially extended tw solutions bifurcate subcritically out of it we have investigated in quantitative detail relaxed , strongly nonlinear oscillatory convection structures with one or two interfaces to the quiescent fluid , i.e , fronts and ltws , respectively .",
    "they are time - periodic global nonlinear modes : in the frame that is comoving with the respective front velocity @xmath55 or with the ltw drift velocity @xmath18 the oscillations have everywhere the same period .",
    "fronts come in two varieties . in a @xmath56front state the quiescent fluid",
    "is located upstream , i.e. , phase propagates out of it into convection . in a @xmath58front the quiescent fluid",
    "is located in downstream direction and phase moves out of convection into conduction .",
    "the lowest rayleigh number for the existence of fronts is the lowest saddle - node location of extended tws , @xmath181 : below it there are no tws to which the interface from conduction can connect .",
    "however , ltws of _ finite _ length @xmath90 can coexist bistably together with the conductive state well below the lowest tw saddle when the soret coupling is sufficiently negative , @xmath182 .",
    "furthermore , we have arguments that wacs at end walls of rectangular channels can exist even at smaller @xmath21 than ltws .",
    "central for understanding fronts and ltws is a large - scale concentration redistribution that influences the buoyancy at the interfaces to conduction in different ways than in the bulk tw parts .",
    "for example , at the @xmath56interfaces of fronts and ltws alike there is a buoyancy overshoot which is sufficiently large to sustain local convection growth there and that can cause even invasion of convection into the stable quiescent fluid . at the @xmath58interface",
    "the lateral buoyancy variation is such as to induce the decay of the approaching convection rolls into the conductive state .",
    "front velocities as well as ltw drift velocities are much smaller than the phase velocities of the carrier waves for reasons that are related to the concentration redistribution dynamics .",
    "the velocities of @xmath56fronts decrease with growing @xmath21 while those of @xmath58fronts increase . at some @xmath88 they become equal so that both fronts move with the same velocity . at this rayleigh number the length @xmath90 of the ltws diverges and there , and strictly speaking only there ,",
    "the limiting ltw can be seen as a state consisting of two fronts .",
    "however , @xmath56fronts and long ltws have almost identical propagation velocities and frequencies .",
    "furthermore , they select a similar bulk wave number .",
    "the selected frequencies and bulk wave numbers are close to those of a saddle - node tw .",
    "in fact , it is the @xmath56front - like growth interface that selects the properties of long ltws .",
    "small amplitude extended tw perturbations of the conductive state oscillate with the large hopf frequency .",
    "but the global - mode oscillation is restrained by the requirement that its frequency has to allow stable developed bulk tw convection .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath56interface connecting conduction with convection selects the largest possible frequency eigenvalue that meets this requirement , namely the tw saddle - node frequency .",
    "all our @xmath56fronts select bulk tw wave numbers close to the large-@xmath92 branch of the tw saddle - node curve , i.e. , wave numbers that are too large to be eckhaus stable .",
    "however , these tws are only convectively unstable : perturbations can grow but while doing so they are advected sufficiently fast downstream in the direction of the tw phase propagation so that they can not influence the upstream part of the @xmath56front state in a persistent way .",
    "while @xmath56front states seem to be uniquely selected we could produce for a fixed @xmath21 different coherent @xmath58fronts that were characterized in the bulk part by different wave numbers and frequencies close to the tw saddles .",
    "the decay interface adjusts itself to the respective bulk tw part but does not exert an influence in upstream direction on the bulk convection within a coherent @xmath58front .",
    "in contrast , the growth under a @xmath56interface induces in downstream direction a long concentration wake that is characteristic for @xmath56fronts and long ltws and of special importance for the latter .",
    "here it is interesting to notice that all the interfaces of fronts and ltws consist typically only of about 3 - 4 convection rolls .",
    "we furthermore should like to mention that @xmath56interfaces of fronts and ltws always locate a minimal wavelength .",
    "its value , @xmath85 , is remarkably universal for _ all @xmath21 and @xmath10 _ that we have simulated .",
    "this is unexplained so far .",
    "we have also prepared initial two - front stuctures by connecting a @xmath56front and a @xmath58front with a common long bulk tw . when @xmath133 they expand .",
    "but at @xmath122 they shrink towards a uniquely selected ltw of fixed length @xmath90 . here",
    "the downstream wake in the concentration field of the preceeding @xmath56front exerts an effective repulsion on the approaching @xmath58interface : the invasion of conduction via the latter is stopped at a well defined distance @xmath90 that is determined by the concentration - induced buoyancy levels in the wake of the @xmath56front .",
    "ltws shortly below @xmath88 ( where ltw with diverging @xmath90 are possible ) are very long .",
    "their drift velocities , frequencies , and many stuctural properties are similar to those of @xmath56fronts .",
    "decreasing @xmath21 the ltw length decreases and one eventually arrives for any @xmath10 at the regime of short ltws that lies for strongly negative @xmath10 well below the tw saddle - nodes .",
    "these short ltws without a convection plateau are qualitatively different structures .",
    "this is also reflected by their drift velocities and frequencies showing a variation with @xmath21 that differs from those of long ltws .",
    "the shortest possible ltws are realized at the lower end of the @xmath21 band of ltws .",
    "these minimal pulses always contained about 5 convection rolls for all soret couplings that we have investigated .",
    "this surprising universality of @xmath151 remains to be explained .",
