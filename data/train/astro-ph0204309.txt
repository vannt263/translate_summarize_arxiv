    "stars form in the dense cores of molecular clouds and eventually emerge as visible objects . thus the molecular gas and dust surrounding newly formed stars should be disrupted .",
    "massive stars are expected to play an important role in dispersing the ambient materials , since they emit strong radiation , stellar winds , and outflows even at their earliest evolutionary stage .",
    "moreover , massive stars could dramatically impact on the surrounding environments through hii  regions and supernova explosions .",
    "however , direct observational evidence of this conjecture is rarely seen .",
    "w31 is one of the brightest hii  region / molecular cloud complex in the inner galaxy .",
    "kalberla , goss , & wilson ( 1982 ) suggested on the basis of their sensitive hi  absorption line observations that w31 is associated with the expanding 3-kpc arm with a peculiar velocity of @xmath1030  km  s@xmath11  and so lies about 6  kpc from the sun ( see also wilson 1974 ) .",
    "we adopt this distance throughout the present paper , although there are some reports that propose different distances , e.g. , 14.5@xmath121.4  kpc ( corbel et al .",
    "1997 ) and 3.4@xmath120.3  kpc ( blum , damineli , & conti 2001 ) .",
    "w31 appears as two prominent extended hii  regions , g10.2@xmath40.3 and g10.3@xmath40.1 , in the radio continuum maps with low ( @xmath131@xmath14 ) angular resolutions ( e.g. , reich , reich , & frst 1990 ) .",
    "high - resolution ( @xmath1510@xmath16 ) radio continuum observations show that the central regions of both hii  regions form elongated ionization ridges ( woodward , helfer , & pipher 1984 ; ghosh et al .",
    "1989 ) . two ultracompact ( uc ) hii  regions , g10.15@xmath40.34 and g10.30@xmath40.15 , were found to be located at the peaks of the ionization ridges , respectively ( wood & churchwell 1989 ; kim & koo 2001 ) .",
    "several other massive young stellar objects were also identified in g10.2@xmath40.3 by near - infrared observations ( blum et al .",
    "these suggest that massive star formation is actively ongoing in the w31 complex . on the other hand , a crab - like supernova remnant ( snr )",
    "g10.0@xmath40.3 is @xmath1010@xmath14 southwest of g10.15@xmath40.34 .",
    "the snr is likely to be associated with a soft @xmath17-ray repeater , sgr 1806@xmath420 ( kulkarni et al . 1994 ) .",
    "accordingly , the w31 complex seems to be one of the best laboratories for studying the formation of massive stars and the interaction of massive stars with their parental molecular cloud .    in this paper , we present radio continuum , radio recombination line ( rrl ) , and various molecular line observations of the w31 complex .",
    "our observations aim to investigate the physical characteristics of molecular clouds that are actively forming massive stars , and to explore how massive stars and their natal molecular clouds interact with each other .",
    "the observations are described in   2 and the results are presented in   3 . in   4 we discuss the physical properties of the w31 molecular cloud and the interaction between ionized and molecular gas in the region .",
    "our main results are summarized in the last section .",
    "the radio continuum and rrl data are extracted from the survey of 16 uc  hii  regions with extended envelopes .",
    "the observational details were presented by kim & koo ( 2001 ) . in summary ,",
    "radio continuum observations were made at 21  cm with the vla of the nrao in 1995 february .",
    "the array was in the dnc hybrid configuration and the observations were sensitive to structures up to 15@xmath14 .",
    "the final map resulted from two separate pointings of the array .",
    "the phase centers were set at g10.15@xmath40.34 and g10.30@xmath40.15 , i.e. , @xmath18= ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) and ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) or @xmath23= ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "the data were calibrated , imaged , and mosaicked using the aips .",
    "the resulting synthesized half - power beamwidth was @xmath28 and the rms noise level of final image was 1.7 mjy  beam@xmath11 .",
    "h76@xmath0  ( 14.68999 ghz ) rrl observations were conducted using the 140 foot telescope of the nrao in 1997 february and june .",
    "the telescope has a fwhm of about 2@xmath14 and a main beam efficiency of 0.58 at the observing frequency .",
    "both circular polarizations were observed simultaneously using two 1024 channel autocorrelators with 40  mhz bandwidth each , yielding a velocity resolution of 1.59  km  s@xmath11  after hanning smoothing .",
    "we have carried out @xmath1co , @xmath2co , cs , and c@xmath3s  line observations of the w31 complex .",
    "a summary of the observations is given in table 1 .",
    "@xmath2co j=1@xmath40  and @xmath1co  j=2@xmath41 line observations were made with the 12  m telescope of the nrao at kitt peak using the on - the - fly mapping technique .",

    "a squared area of @xmath29 centered at @xmath18= ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) was mapped at 20@xmath16 spacing in the @xmath2co j=1@xmath40  line , while a @xmath32 region centered at g10.30@xmath40.15 was mapped at 10@xmath16 sampling in the @xmath1co  j=2@xmath41 line .",
    "we used positions with some emission as reference positions , ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 )  = ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) and ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) , because we could not find any positions devoid of @xmath1co  and/or @xmath2co  emission near the source .",

    "we mapped two regions of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , centered at g10.15@xmath40.34 and g10.30@xmath40.15 in full - beam ( 60@xmath16 ) spacing .",
    "the two uc  hii  regions were observed in the cs j=3@xmath42 and c@xmath3s  j=2@xmath41 and j=3@xmath42 lines as well .",
    "we used sis mixer receivers with 256 channel filterbanks of 64  mhz bandwidth .",
    "the spectra were obtained by position switching to ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 )  = ( @xmath35 , @xmath44 ) , which was checked to be free from appreciable ( @xmath45  k ) cs emission . the system temperature varied in the range 300@xmath4500  k at 98  ghz and 600@xmath4800  k at 147  ghz .",

    "figure 1 is our 21  cm radio continuum image of the w31 complex .",
    "there are two distinct extended hii  regions , g10.2@xmath40.3 and g10.3@xmath40.1 , in the field .",
    "g10.2@xmath40.3 has several compact components , almost all of which are embedded in low - level extended envelope of @xmath47 ( or 19.0  pc @xmath5 11.1  pc ) .",
    "the central region is elongated in the east - west direction on the whole and is composed of two strong compact components .",

    "high - resolution ( @xmath105@xmath16 ) vla continuum observations at 5  ghz suggest that the central region comprises about 20 dense ionized clumps ( woodward et al .",
    "the surface brightness declines sharply to the west , while it decreases slowly to the east .",
    "figure 2 shows h76@xmath0  spectra observed along @xmath48 .",
    "the center velocity decreases with increasing right ascension .",
    "the velocity difference is about 10  km  s@xmath11  between the central region and the eastern protuberance .    in g10.3@xmath40.1 , there are one isolated compact component and two strong ones surrounded by diffuse emission extending over @xmath49 ( or 22.3  pc @xmath5 8.0  pc ) .",
    "the two central compact components form an ionization ridge elongated in the northeast - southwest direction .",
    "the uc  hii  region g10.30@xmath40.15 is located at the peak of the western one .",
    "the diffuse envelope extends straight in the northwest - southeast direction , which is perpendicular to the central ridge .",
    "there is no significant velocity difference between the central region and the envelope . according to kim & koo ( 2001 ) ,",
    "the uc  hii  regions and their associated compact components are likely to be excited by the same ionizing sources in both g10.2@xmath40.3 and g10.3@xmath40.1 , while the individual compact components may be ionized by separate sources .",
    "figure 3 exhibits @xmath2co j=1@xmath40  line profiles observed towards g10.15@xmath40.34 and g10.30@xmath40.15 .",
    "there are three or more velocity components in the lines of sight . in each spectrum ,",
    "the strongest component is associated with the uc  hii  region .",
    "the center velocities of @xmath2co  gas are shifted by 5@xmath48  km  s@xmath11  from those of the ionized gas , marked by the vertical dotted lines .",
    "there seem to be high - velocity wings in the @xmath2co  lines of both uc  hiiregions , even though the features are significantly confused by multiple velocity components .",
    "shepherd & churchwell ( 1996 ) have also found high - velocity wings in the @xmath1co j=1@xmath40  line of g10.30@xmath40.15 , but could not identify them in g10.15@xmath40.34 due to a complex blend of lines .",
    "we will discuss in more detail the high - velocity gas using our cs spectra in the next section .",
    "figure 4 is @xmath2co  line integrated intensity map , obtained by integrating over the velocity range between @xmath50  = 0 and 22  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "large crosses indicate the positions of uc  hii  regions , while small crosses represent the peak positions of the strong compact components without uc  hii  regions ( see fig .",
    "the molecular cloud is very clumpy .",
    "there is a large hollow over the central region , which makes the cloud appear as an incomplete shell being open to the northeast .",
    "a possible explanation for this morphology is that the cloud has been produced by energetic events near the center , such as strong stellar winds and/or supernova explosions of massive stars , although we have not found any massive star or nonthermal radio continuum emission in the hollow region . as will be discussed in   4.2 , the dynamical age of g10.2@xmath40.3 is similar to that of g10.3@xmath40.1 , suggesting that star formation has begun almost simultaneously at the southern spherical and northern flat components",
    ". this may be in favor of the above interpretation .",
    "it seems that the northern component has been substantially dispersed by massive stars , since a small but conspicuous hollow exists near the uc and compact hii  regions , @xmath18 @xmath51 ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) ( see   4.2 ) . in the southern component , on the contrary",
    ", the dense @xmath2co  cores associated with the uc and compact hii  regions are still strong .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the integrated intensity drops steeply on the eastern boundary of the southern component , in contrast to the radio continuum intensity distribution .",
    "figure 5 displays the channel maps of the molecular cloud .",
    "@xmath2co  emission appears mainly in the velocity range between 2 and 20  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the channel maps show that the northern and southern components are certainly associated , and reveal more clearly incomplete shell - like morphology of the cloud .",
    "the molecular gas shell remains nearly constant in size as the velocity varies , suggesting that it does not dynamically expand or contract .",
    "there are small velocity variations in both northern and southern components .",
    "as the velocity decreases , strong @xmath2co  emission moves from the western part to the eastern part in the northern component , while it moves from the northeastern part through the northern part to the southern part in the southern component .",
    "the @xmath2co  core associated with g10.15@xmath40.34 ( @xmath108  km  s@xmath11 ) is slightly blueshifted from the main shell - like structure ( @xmath1012  km  s@xmath11 ) .",
    "the northern flat component seems to be nearly broken through at the position of the distinctive hollow , which persists over a velocity interval of 10@xmath415  km  s@xmath11 . assuming that the molecular gas is in local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) , @xmath2co  column density , @xmath54 , can be computed from the formula ( see , e.g. , dickman 1978 )    @xmath55    where @xmath56  is the excitation temperature in k , @xmath57 is the optical depth , @xmath58 is the velocity in km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the mass of molecular cloud , @xmath59 , is measured to be 6.20@xmath510@xmath6  @xmath7 , provided that @xmath2co  abundance relative to h@xmath60 is 2@xmath510@xmath61 ( dickman 1978 ) . in this calculation",
    "we assumed that the cloud boundary is @xmath62 k km  s@xmath11and that @xmath56  is 30  k in the central regions of the northern and southern components and 15  k in the outer regions , based on our @xmath1co  line data and the massachusetts - stony brook @xmath1co  galactic plane survey ( sanders et al .",
    "our mass estimate adopted a mean molecular weight of 2.3 to account for the contribution of helium .",
    "table  2 summarizes the physical parameters of the w31 molecular cloud .",
    "figure 6 exhibits our cs and c@xmath3s  line profiles obtained towards g10.15@xmath40.34 and g10.30@xmath40.15 .",
    "the line parameters of these spectra are presented in table 3 .",
    "there is a single velocity component along the line of sight and it is associated with each uc  hii  region .",
    "the center velocity of cs gas is in good agreement with that of @xmath2co  gas .",
    "the cs j=2@xmath41 and j=3@xmath42 lines of both uc  hii  regions show distinct high - velocity wings .",
    "this implies that dense gas exists in high - velocity molecular components .",
    "there are a few tens of massive star - forming regions where high - velocity wings have been observed in the cs lines . for example ,",
    "plume , jaffe , & evans ( 1992 ) detected cs j=7@xmath46 line emission in 104 massive star - forming regions , selected originally by the presence of an h@xmath60o maser , and found high - velocity wings in more than 18 out of them .",
    "the full widths of the cs j=2@xmath41 lines are about 50  km  s@xmath11  at typical rms noise level for g10.15@xmath40.34 and about 30  km  s@xmath11  for g10.30@xmath40.15 .",
    "these values are similar to those expected from the @xmath2co  lines , respectively .",
    "the cs j=3@xmath42 line of g10.30@xmath40.15 has very similar shape and full width as the cs j=2@xmath41 line , while the cs j=3@xmath42 line of g10.15@xmath40.34 has a different asymmetric shape and a smaller ( 20  km  s@xmath11 ) full width than the cs j=2@xmath41 line .",
    "the full width of the cs j=2@xmath41 line of g10.15@xmath40.34 is comparable to that of g5.89@xmath40.39 , which drives one of the most energetic outflows in the galaxy ( harvey & forveille 1988 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "we can not find high - velocity wings in the cs lines observed in the surrounding regions of both uc  hii  regions .",
    "it seems mainly because the extents of cs outflows are @xmath631@xmath14 , taking into account that co outflows observed in massive star - forming regions usually have linear sizes of @xmath632  pc ( ridge & moore 2001 ; beuther et al .",
    "so high - resolution cs line observations are required to confirm whether the high - velocity gas is indeed due to bipolar molecular outflows , and to explore the physical and dynamical properties of the outflows .",
    "assuming that the excitation temperature and the beam filling factor are identical in the cs and c@xmath3s  lines in each transition , we determine the optical depth of c@xmath3s  line emission , @xmath64 , from the peak brightness temperature ratio using the following formula    @xmath65 /   \\bigl[1 - { \\rm exp}(-\\tau_{\\rm p}r ) \\bigr].\\ ] ]    the estimated values are listed in table 3 . here",
    "the cs to c@xmath3sabundance ratio , @xmath66 , was assumed to be equal to the terrestrial value ( 22.5 ) .",
    "figure 7 shows integrated cs j=2@xmath41  line intensity maps .",
    "the cs gas distribution agrees well with the @xmath2co  gas distribution in the dense regions of the northern and southern components .",
    "we can see the prominent hollow near g10.30@xmath40.15 in the cs gas distribution as well .",
    "the uc  hii  regions correspond to the peaks of cs cores , while the compact components without uc  hii  regions do not .",
    "this seems to be consistent with the result of kim & koo ( 2001 ) that the compact components with uc  hii  regions are smaller and denser than those without uc  hii  regions .",
    "based on the observation they suggested that the former are in an earlier evolutionary stage than the latter .",

    "if a molecular cloud has a uniform temperature , these high ratios can be obtained when the molecular gas is warm , dense , and less opaque .",

    "1994 ) showed on the basis of an one - zone large velocity gradient ( lvg ) analysis that ratios greater than unity are produced when the co - emitting regions have @xmath56@xmath7140  k , @xmath72@xmath711@xmath510@xmath73  @xmath74 , and @xmath75@xmath155 . in this model",
    "the ratio variation is mainly attributed to the density variation of unresolved clumps that constitute the cloud .",
    "however such a single - temperature model does not seem to be applicable to our case , since the ratio of @xmath1co j=1@xmath40  and @xmath2co j=1@xmath40  line intensities , @xmath76 , ranges between 1.3 and 6.7 with an average of 2.7 , indicating that @xmath1co  line emission is optically thick ( @xmath75@xmath775 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the high ratios can also be obtained when a dense molecular cloud is externally heated by strong far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation .",
    "gierens , stutzki , & winnewisser ( 1992 ) performed a detailed @xmath1co  and @xmath2co  line radiative transfer analysis for spherically symmetric clumps irradiated by intense fuv radiation , and showed that the ratios @xmath13 1 observed in the orion a molecular cloud are easily explained by the temperature and abundance variations within the photodissociation region layer of the clumps .",

    "this seems to be consistent with the observation that more luminous @xmath85 sources tend to be associated with more massive cs cores in the gemini complex , suggesting that more massive cores in general form more massive stars ( carpenter et al .",
    "similar results have been found in the orion b ( l1630 ) molecular cloud ( lada 1992 ) and the rosette molecular cloud ( phelps & lada 1997 ) . in these molecular clouds the embedded clusters are associated with the most massive dense cores .",

    "this difference is likely due to difference in evolution ( destruction of dense cores by massive stars ) as well as difference in the initial physical properties , since some newly formed massive stars have already emerged as visible objects in the regions ( e.g. , stephenson & hobbs 1961 ; warren & hesser 1978 ) .",
    "the ratio of infrared ( ir ) luminosity to mass is a good measure of the massive star formation activity of molecular clouds .",

    "the total ir luminosity in the wavelength range 1@xmath4500  @xmath87 m , @xmath92 , can be calculated from @xmath88 and @xmath89 in jy using the following formula ( lonsdale et al .",
    "1985 ; lee et al .",
    "1996 )      where @xmath94 is the 60/100  @xmath87 m  color temperature in k , @xmath95 is the index in the emissivity law , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is the source distance in kpc .",
    "the @xmath98 is color correction factor that accounts for the flux radiated outside the 60  @xmath87 m  and 100  @xmath87 m  @xmath85 bands .",
    "if @xmath95 is assumed to be 1 ( hildebrand 1983 ) , @xmath92  is derived to be 5.8@xmath510@xmath99  @xmath8 , which gives @xmath92/@xmath59=9.4  @xmath8/@xmath7 .",
    "this estimate is much greater than the average ratio ( 2.8  @xmath8/@xmath7 ) of all molecular clouds in the inner galactic plane , but is comparable to the median value ( 7  @xmath8/@xmath7 ) for gmcs with hii  regions ( scoville & good 1989 ) . we also derive star formation efficiency , sfe@xmath100 , of the w31 cloud .",
    "the stellar mass @xmath101 was computed from the lynman continuum photon flux @xmath102  measured by radio continuum observations of g10.2@xmath40.3 and g10.3@xmath40.1 , 2.7@xmath510@xmath103 photons  s@xmath11 ( kim & koo 2001 ) . here",
    "we adopt @xmath104 @xmath7  ( photons  s@xmath11)@xmath11 , which was determined by mckee & williams ( 1997 ) using the initial mass function of scalo ( 1986 ) and the parameters of ob stars of vacca , garmany , & shull ( 1996 ) .",
    "the sfe estimated for the entire cloud is 3% , which is somewhat greater than the galactic median value of @xmath102% ( myers et al .",
    "1986 ) . on the other hand , the sfe s for the two cs - emitting regions",
    "are derived to be 6% and 4% , respectively ( table 3 ) .",
    "figure 9 shows the ionized gas distribution ( contours ) superposed on the molecular gas distribution ( color ) . for both g10.2@xmath40.3 and g10.3@xmath40.1",
    ", the morphology of extended envelope seems to be largely determined by the distribution of the ambient molecular gas . in g10.2@xmath40.3 , the radio continuum surface brightness decreases slowly to the east while it drops rapidly to the west .",
    "this surface brightness behavior can be naturally understood if the central part of g10.2@xmath40.3 is situated within the molecular cloud and the eastern protuberance is a result of the champagne flow ( israel 1978 ; tenorio - tagle 1979 ) . a large ( @xmath1310  km  s@xmath11 ) velocity gradient exists between the central and eastern parts ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , which is compatible with what would be expected from the champagne flow model . on the other hand ,",
    "the extended envelope of g10.3@xmath40.1 has a bipolar morphology .",
    "such a morphology can be created by the champagne flow in case where the hii region forms in a flat molecular cloud ( bodenheimer , tenorio - tagle , & yorke 1979 ; tenorio - tagle , yorke , bodenheimer 1979 ) .",
    "indeed the distribution of molecular gas in the region is severely elongated in the direction orthogonal to the bipolar axis of g10.3@xmath40.1 ( see also fig .",
    "7@xmath34 ) .",
    "therefore , the extended envelope of g10.3@xmath40.1 is also likely to be a consequence of the champagne flow .",
    "however , we have not observed any significant velocity difference between the central region and the envelope .",
    "this might be due to a small inclination .",
    "the velocity of a champagne flow is determined by the pressure contrast at the cloud boundary and can increase up to about 30  km  s@xmath11(tenorio - tagle 1979 ) .",
    "since the farthest boundary is @xmath1012  pc ( 7@xmath14 ) from the central region for both g10.2@xmath40.3 and g10.3@xmath40.1 , their dynamical ages may be in the range ( 4@xmath412 ) @xmath5 10@xmath6  yr . for g10.2@xmath40.3 , our estimate matches with the result of blum et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who derived a mean age of @xmath101@xmath510@xmath99  yr for the embedded cluster associated with the eastern compact component in the central region , based on their near - ir photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "a striking feature is the distinctive molecular gas hollow in the northern flat component of the w31 cloud .",
    "the hollow is @xmath104  pc ( 2.@xmath1054 ) in size .",
    "it is located close to the uc and compact hii regions .",
    "the thickness of the flat molecular cloud is much smaller at the hole position than other parts .",
    "these observations strongly suggest that the hollow might have been produced due to the dispersion and destruction of molecular gas by the hii regions and their ionizing stars .",
    "this view is supported by the fact that the @xmath1co  j=2@xmath41/j=1@xmath40 integrated intensity ratio exceed unity around the uc and compact hii  regions , implying that the hii  regions and their central stars are closely interacting with the surrounding molecular materials .",
    "it is well known that the surrounding gas and dust of newly formed massive stars should be eventually dispersed and destroyed by strong radiation , stellar winds , and hii  regions .",
    "if the molecular gas column density of the hollow region had been equal to the average value of the surrounding regions , which have @xmath106 k km  s@xmath11 , the amount of molecular gas dispersed by the massive stars would be ( 4@xmath121)@xmath510@xmath73  @xmath7 .",
    "the quoted error represents variation in the measured mass depending on the assumed threshold value for the surrounding regions .",
    "our estimate is not very different from the ionized gas mass of g10.3@xmath40.1 , 2@xmath510@xmath73  @xmath7 , determined from radio continuum observations ( kim & koo 2001 ) .",
    "the derived mass and dynamical age imply that the disruption rate of the molecular cloud is ( 3@xmath410)@xmath510@xmath107  @xmath7  yr@xmath11 , which is very similar to the results of two - dimensional numerical calculations for the champagne flows in various conditions , ( 5@xmath410)@xmath510@xmath107  @xmath7  yr@xmath11 ( yorke , bodenheimer , & tenorio - tagle 1982 ) .",
    "whitworth ( 1979 ) also performed a semi - analytic study on the efficiency with which massive stars destroy their parental molecular clouds and showed that the disruption rate is determined by the lyman continuum photon flux , the ambient density , and the elapse time .",
    "the lyman continuum photon flux of g10.3@xmath40.1 is 5.5@xmath510@xmath108 photons s@xmath11 ( kim & koo 2001 ) . the average density of the surrounding regions with @xmath106 k km  s@xmath11  is @xmath101@xmath510@xmath73  @xmath74 . in that case",
    "the disruption rate is ( 5@xmath121)@xmath510@xmath107  @xmath7  yr@xmath11 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the rate estimated above , too .",
    "in addition to strong radiation , the bipolar outflow associated with g10.30@xmath40.15 might have played a role in the dispersion process .",
    "therefore , it is most likely that the northern flat molecular cloud is being disrupted by newly formed massive stars .",
    "this may also be true for the southern spherical molecular cloud , although compelling observational evidence for molecular gas disruption have not been found except the champagne flow .",
    "we have carried out 21  cm radio continuum , h76@xmath0  rrl , @xmath1co , @xmath2co , cs , and c@xmath3s  line observations of the w31 hii  region / molecular cloud complex .",
    "the physical parameters of the w31 cloud are largely comparable to those of other gmcs that are undergoing active massive star formation . however , the cs - emitting regions are more massive and larger than those of some other gmcs with indicators of massive star formation .",
    "the large amount of dense ( @xmath1310@xmath9  @xmath74 ) gas implies that the w31 cloud has ability to form rich stellar clusters and suggests , together with the young dynamical ages ( @xmath631@xmath510@xmath99  yr ) of g10.2@xmath40.3 and g10.3@xmath40.1 , that star formation has recently begun in the cloud . on the other hand ,",
    "we have found high - velocity molecular gas towards g10.15@xmath40.34 and g10.30@xmath40.15 , which are likely due to bipolar outflows .",
    "the extended envelopes of both g10.2@xmath40.3 and g10.3@xmath40.1 may be results of the champagne flows , based on the distributions of ionized and molecular gas and the velocity gradient of rrl emission . in the vicinity of the uc and compact hii  regions in g10.3@xmath40.1 ,",
    "a distinctive molecular gas hollow is present and the @xmath1co  j=2@xmath41/j=1@xmath40 line intensity ratio exceeds unity .",
    "together these observations support that the hii  regions and their ionizing stars are strongly interacting with the surrounding molecular materials .",
    "therefore , w31 is a good example showing not only formation of massive stars but also destruction of their parental molecular cloud by them .",
    "we are grateful to bob blum , john carpenter , youngung lee , and young chol minh for helpful comments , and yong - sun park for giving us part of his observing time at the trao .",
    "we also thank the staff at the ipac in caltech for processing the @xmath85 hires maps for w31 region .",
