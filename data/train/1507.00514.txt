    "multi - wavelength light curves of blazar flares show complex and diversified features . while in some cases there is a time lag between gamma - ray and x - ray / optical flares ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in other cases an orphan flare in a certain wavelength was detected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even if a time - dependent model is adopted , such a variety of behaviors may be difficult to reproduce with by a one - zone model @xcite . while spatial gradients of the physical parameters in the emission regions @xcite may explain some fraction of the lags , some flares have spectral evolutions thatare too complex to be modeled , even with time - dependent multi - zone radiative transfer simulations @xcite .",
    "this may imply that inhomogeneous emission regions evolve with a longer timescale than a dynamical one . such nontrivial properties in a blazar flare",
    "make it difficult to probe physical processes such as electron acceleration or cooling .    in 2013 december , the _ fermi_-large area telescope ( lat ) detected one of the most intense flares in the gamma - ray band from flat spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) 3c  279 , reaching @xmath0 for the integrated flux above 100mev  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h15 ) .",
    "the flux level is comparable to the historical maximum of this source observed at the gamma - ray band  @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray flare showed a very rapid variability with an asymmetric time profile with a shorter rising time of @xmath1hr and a longer falling time of @xmath2hr .",
    "we can expect that this extraordinary flare was emitted from a sufficiently compact region that can be regarded as homogeneous , which is different from other usual flares . in this case",
    ", the decaying timescale may directly correspond to the cooling timescale , and the flare is an ideal target for discussing the physical processes .",
    "another important property of the flare event of 3c 279 , a very hard photon index of @xmath3 , was observed in the @xmath4mev band by _",
    "such a hard photon index has been rarely observed in fsrqs , whose luminosity peak from inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering is usually located below 100mev . while the mean of the @xmath5 distribution in fsrqs corresponds to about 2.4 @xcite , hard photon indices @xmath6",
    "only have been occasionally observed in some bright fsrqs during rapid flaring events  @xcite . in order to reproduce the hard photon index by ic scattering in the fast cooling regime",
    ", the index of parent electrons should be much harder than two , which can hardly be generated in a normal shock acceleration process .",
    "in addition , the flare event of 3c  279 indicates a high compton dominance parameter @xmath7 , leading to extremely low jet magnetization with @xmath8  ( h15 ) .    to explain the flare event of 3c  279 , rather than assuming prompt electron injection by the shock acceleration",
    ", we propose the stochastic acceleration ( sa ) model , which is phenomenologically equivalent to the second - order fermi acceleration ( fermi - ii ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the sa may be driven by magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "otherwise , hydrodynamical turbulences that drive the acceleration are possibly induced via the kelvin ",
    "helmholtz instability as an axial mode ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the rayleigh  taylor and richtmyer  meshkov instabilities as radial modes @xcite .",
    "broadband spectra of blazars in the steady state have been successfully fitted with recent sa models @xcite .",
    "the flare state should be also tested with such models to show the wide - range applicability of the sa .",
    "this is the first attempt to apply a fermi - ii model to explain both broadband spectra and light curves of fsrqs simultaneously .    in this letter",
    ", we perform time - dependent simulations of the emissions from 3c 279 with the sa . starting from modeling a steady emission ,",
    "the gamma - ray flare is reproduced by decreasing the magnetic field for the steady model .",
    "we demonstrate that the sa model agrees with the observed spectrum and light curve .",
    "we adopt the numerical simulation code used in @xcite . in this model , a conical outflow with an opening angle @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is its bulk lorentz factor , is ejected at radius @xmath11 from the central engine .",
    "the evolutions of electron and photon energy distributions are calculated in the comoving frame taking into account the sa , synchrotron emission , ic scattering with the klein ",
    "nishina effect , adiabatic cooling , @xmath12 pair production , synchrotron self - absorption , and photon escape .",
    "the sa is characterized by the energy diffusion coefficient , @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite conservatively assumed the kolmogorov - like diffusion as @xmath14 . here , we adopt , however , @xmath15 , which corresponds to the hard - sphere scattering .",
    "this choice leads to reasonable spectra of 3c 279 without complicated assumptions such as nontrivial temporal evolution of the diffusion coefficient or electron injection rate .",
    "if the cascade of the turbulence stops at a certain length scale larger than the gyro - radius of the highest - energy electrons , the mean free path of electrons becomes comparable to this scale independently of electron energies .",
    "in this case , the energy diffusion can be approximated as the hard - sphere scattering ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the recent magnetohydrodynamical simulations accompanying the inverse cascade shows the @xmath16 spectrum in turbulences @xcite , which also support the hard - sphere approximation .",
    "the volume we consider is a conical shell with a constant width of @xmath17 , then the isotropically equivalent volume @xmath18 ( the actual volume is @xmath19 ) .",
    "hereafter , the values in the shell frame are denoted with prime characters . during the dynamical timescale @xmath20 in the plasma frame ,",
    "electrons are injected at a constant rate @xmath21 in the volume @xmath22 monoenergetically ( @xmath23 ) and accelerated with a constant coefficient @xmath24 . as done in @xcite",
    ", we can consider the temporal evolutions of the injection rate and the diffusion coefficient .",
    "however , this simple model with constant @xmath21 and @xmath24 is sufficient to reproduce the photon spectrum of 3c 279 . the average magnetic field in the comoving frame",
    "is assumed to behave as @xmath25 .",
    "the evolution of the photon spectrum for observers is computed taking into account the relativistic motion and curvature of the jet surface .",
    "as a reference case , we consider one of the most active periods in the gamma - ray band during the first two years of the _ fermi_-lat observations . in @xcite ,",
    "this period is denoted as period `` d '' in 2009 .",
    "although this period corresponds to an event with a prominent flare , the broadband spectrum in the paper is averaged over five days .",
    "if the emission zone is inside the broad emission region as suggested by the short variability timescale reported in h15 , the flare state is significantly longer than the variability timescale .",
    "therefore , we adopt a steady emission model for period d in 2009 .    by assuming continuous steady ejection of the shells from @xmath11 , we model the steady photon spectrum , though the plasma and its emission evolves with @xmath26 in the shell frame .",
    "the model parameters are @xmath27 pc , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , and @xmath33 g. we adopt the same model as that of @xcite for the external radiation of the broad emission lines with the photon temperature @xmath34  ev and the energy density @xmath35 in the shell frame . the cooling timescale in this external radiation field",
    "is written as @xmath36    as shown in figure [ fig : ele1 ] ( a ) , electrons are continuously accelerated between @xmath11 and @xmath37 , then they are rapidly cooled via ic scattering after the shutdown of the acceleration .",
    "the electron spectrum at @xmath37 in the low - energy region is consistent with the assumed power - law index of @xmath38 in the broken power - law model of @xcite . in the highest - energy region , though the klein ",
    "nishina effect suppresses the ic cooling effect , the synchrotron cooling ( @xmath39 ) prevent the acceleration above @xmath40 mev .",
    "the resultant photon spectrum well reproduces the observed spectrum from far - infrared to gamma - ray bands ( see figure [ fig : ele1 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the low - energy cutoff at @xmath41 ev is due to the synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "the x - ray flux is originated from the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission .",
    "those x - ray data strongly constrain the emission radius @xmath42 .    thus , our sa model can naturally produce a hard electron spectrum , and the steady photon spectrum agrees with the observed one in 2009 .",
    "based on this result , we will probe the intensive flare in 2013 in the next section .",
    "the most intensive flare denoted as period `` b '' ( on mjd 56646 ) in h15 shows a very hard spectrum with @xmath43 and a short variability with an hourly scale in the gamma - ray band observed with _",
    "during a short time interval of the gamma - ray flare period ( 0.2 days ) , there were simultaneous optical observations , whose results did not show any correlated variability with the gamma - ray flare as presented in h15 .",
    "the x - ray observations in the period are available from _ swift_-bat transient monitor results by the _",
    "swift_-bat team @xcite .",
    "the data provided an upper limit in the 15 - 50 kev band .",
    "we adopt the same values for @xmath42 , @xmath10 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 as those in the previous section . by changing @xmath24 , @xmath21 , and @xmath46",
    ", we attempt to fit the spectrum of the flaring period b in 2013 .",
    "we consider one shell that contributes to the flare emission . the energy diffusion coefficient and injection rate",
    "are slightly increased from the values in the steady model to @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , respectively .",
    "hereafter , we call this the `` fiducial '' flare model .",
    "no significant concurrent flare in the optical bands implies that the optical photons are emitted from other steady components . as discussed in section 4.3 in h15",
    ", the lack of overall correlation between the optical and gamma - ray bands in 2013 - 2014 also suggests the different origin of the optical component .",
    "the synchrotron flux of the flare should be below the observed flux level so that an upper limit for the magnetic field in the flare zone will be given . here",
    ", we adopt a very low value of @xmath51 g.    figure [ fig : ele2 ] ( a ) shows the evolution of the electron energy distribution in this flare model .",
    "electrons are accelerated to higher energies compared to the case in the steady model .",
    "the power - law distributions above @xmath52  ev are due to not only the larger @xmath24 but also the inefficiency of the synchrotron cooling owing to the low magnetic field .",
    "the secondary bumps at @xmath53  ev for @xmath54-@xmath55 are attributed to the generation of secondary electron ",
    "positron pairs via internal @xmath12 absorption .",
    "the resultant gamma - ray spectra shown in figure [ fig : ele2 ] ( b ) agree well with the observed gamma - ray data . here , we add an underlying component ( that overlaps the solid gray line in the figure ) to explain the gamma - ray flux before the flare and the optical data .",
    "the flare spectrum has a higher synchrotron peak energy than the model in h15 , since our flare model shows a drastic growth of the maximum energy of electrons compared to the steady model .",
    "as remarked above , the weak magnetic field strikingly increases the maximum energy of electrons .",
    "even for this low magnetic field , the optical flux is slightly enhanced during the flare .",
    "the steady behavior of the optical light curve may prefer a weaker magnetic field , but we regard this as a conservative upper limit .    the sharp cutoff at @xmath56  ev in the photon spectrum is due to the @xmath12 absorption inside the emission region .",
    "some fraction of photons above @xmath57  ev escape from the shell .",
    "the model flux at the @xmath40 gev band is still higher than the detection limit for erenkov telescopes .",
    "however , it should be noted that we have neglected the @xmath12 absorption after the escape from the shell .",
    "the absorption by the broad emission lines during propagation may greatly suppress the flux around @xmath40 gev .",
    "even for the same values of @xmath42 and @xmath10 as in the steady model , the light curve is well reproduced as shown in figure [ fig : lc ] .",
    "thus , the emission zones of the intense flare in 2013 and the active period in 2009 may be located at similar distances from the central engine .",
    "the observed asymmetric profile in the light curve is favorable for our simple one - shell emission - zone model .",
    "the strong cooling due to the external ic yields the rapid decay of the light curve .",
    "the evolutions of energy densities in figure [ fig : ened ] clearly show the energy input by the sa and rapid cooling just after the end of the acceleration . at @xmath58 ,",
    "the energy density ratio of the magnetic field to electrons is quite low as @xmath59 .",
    "the observational constraints , of course , do not determine the model parameter uniquely .",
    "however , the essential parameter for determining the gamma - ray spectral shape is only @xmath24 in our model ( the role of @xmath21 is just normalizing the flux level , and the value of @xmath46 does not affect the gamma - ray spectral shape ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : comp ] , we compare several photon spectral models derived with different parameter sets .",
    "when we reduce @xmath24 by a factor of two from the fiducial model ( `` low-@xmath60 '' model : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , the others are the same ) , the peak photon energy does not reach 10 gev .",
    "conversely , we increase the diffusion coefficient as shown in the `` high-@xmath60 '' model ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , the others are the same ) . in this case",
    ", we need an even weaker magnetic field .",
    "the peak time of the light curve is delayed due to the lower @xmath21 compared to the fiducial model . in figure",
    "[ fig : lc ] , we shift the light curve by 1.5 hr earlier . other physical parameters ( @xmath10 , etc . ) of the jet were derived from the steady model . however , as h15 supposed , we also try to increase @xmath10 in our model .",
    "the initial radius should be increased as @xmath66 to keep the variability timescale .",
    "such an example ( `` high-@xmath10 '' model : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath24 is the same ) is shown in figure [ fig : comp ] .",
    "due to the relatively short @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , the maximum electron energy grows as high as @xmath73  ev .",
    "a very low magnetic field ( @xmath74 ) is necessary again to suppress the synchrotron flux in the x - ray band .",
    "the strong cooling due to the higher @xmath75 makes the gev spectrum too soft compared to the observed gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "the simple sa model can reasonably explain the very hard spectrum and short variability in the intensive flare in 2013 .",
    "the turbulence driving the particle acceleration may be generated by the hydrodynamical instability or the magnetic reconnection .",
    "compared to the steady model for the active period in 2009 , the drastic alteration we need is the decrease of the magnetic field .",
    "the other parameters have almost similar values .",
    "the absence of the optical flare implies the weak magnetic field ( @xmath76  g ) .",
    "the requirement of the magnetic field decrease at gamma - ray flare stages was suggested by @xcite as well .",
    "the required low magnetic field seems irrelevant to the energy source for the particle acceleration .",
    "therefore , a hydrodynamical instability is responsible for driving the sa .",
    "when @xmath28 , the variability timescale is consistent with @xmath77  pc as shown in figure [ fig : lc ] .",
    "this distance from the engine also agrees with the constraint by the x - ray ssc component in the active period in 2009 .",
    "the size of the central engine may be @xmath78  pc for the black hole mass of @xmath79 .",
    "if we adopt the simplest model for the jet acceleration due to the magnetic energy dissipation @xcite , the bulk lorentz factor at @xmath11 should be @xmath80 , which is inconsistent with the postulated value of @xmath10 .",
    "given the variability timescale @xmath81 , the initial radius can be scaled as @xmath82 when we change @xmath10 . however , even in this case , the maximum lorentz factor at @xmath42 inferred from the magnetic dissipation model increases by a factor of only @xmath83 . for the jet acceleration model by the poynting flux dissipation , not only the low magnetic field but also the short variability timescale are problematic .",
    "this problem is also raised for the very short gamma - ray flare ( a few hundreds seconds ) of bl lac objects like pks 2155304 @xcite . for such ssc - dominant objects , however , the distance from the engine is not well constrained compared to fsrqs .",
    "the tiny change of the diffusion coefficient @xmath24 , in spite of the drastic decrease of the magnetic field , seems enigmatic .",
    "the assumed value of @xmath15 may be favorable for this invariant behavior of @xmath24 . in this low magnetic field case",
    ", the average energy gain per scattering may be proportional to @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the average turbulence velocity , rather than the alfvn velocity .",
    "the pitch angle diffusion approximation @xcite and power - law magnetic turbulence of @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the wavenumber , leads to @xmath88 .",
    "the last factor of @xmath89 implies that electrons interact with higher ( lower ) amplitude turbulence at longer ( shorter ) wavelengths for a weaker ( stronger ) magnetic field . if @xmath90 , @xmath15 results in @xmath91 , which is independent of @xmath92 .",
    "alternatively , magnetic bottles as `` hard spheres '' @xcite may be formed in turbulence independently of the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "such requirements for the turbulence property motivate us to probe the hydrodynamical instabilities in blazar jets .",
