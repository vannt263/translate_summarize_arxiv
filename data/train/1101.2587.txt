    "the purpose of this note is to investigate the relation between rectifiability and * radial projections * @xmath5 , @xmath6 , defined by the expression @xmath7 .",
    "motivated by the famous result of besicovitch and federer concerning orthogonal projections ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 18.1 ) ) , one has reason to anticipate that the radial projections @xmath8 of @xmath0-rectifiable sets @xmath1 with @xmath9 ought to have positive @xmath10 measure for almost all parameters @xmath6 , whereas the opposite behaviour should be manifest in the purely unrectifiable case .",
    "the problem of verifying this intuition in the unrectifiable case appears to be rather involved , and only partial results are available ( see the discussion and references in section [ unrectifiable ] ) ; this note complements those results by settling the rectifiable case .",
    "we show that if no @xmath0-plane contains almost all of an @xmath0-rectifiable set @xmath1 with @xmath9 , then @xmath10 almost all radial projections of @xmath4 have positive @xmath0-dimensional measure .",
    "we also provide an accurate worst case description of the geometry of the * exceptional set * @xmath11 .",
    "our studies were initiated by a question on directions of rectifiable sets , raised by iosevich , mourgoglou and senger in the recent preprint @xcite : a positive answer to this question is acquired in remark [ ims ] .",
    "an @xmath10 measurable set @xmath12 with @xmath13 is called @xmath0-*rectifiable * if there are countably many @xmath14-embeddings @xmath15 such that @xmath16 this definition is equivalent to the classical definition of rectifiability , where we consider coverings by lipschitz - images instead of @xmath14-manifolds , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 15.21 ) .",
    "we include the requirement @xmath9 in the definition of rectifiability merely to avoid repetition .",
    "we say that a set @xmath12 is @xmath0-*flat * , if there exists an @xmath0-plane @xmath17 such that @xmath18 . relaxing this condition slightly",
    ", we say that @xmath4 is * essentially * @xmath0-*flat * , if @xmath19 .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "[ thm1 ] let @xmath1 be an @xmath0-rectifiable set , which is not essentially @xmath0-flat .",
    "then @xmath20 for @xmath21 almost every @xmath22 . is not , strictly speaking , well defined , if @xmath23 . here , and",
    "in the rest of the paper , the notation @xmath8 should be interpreted as @xmath24 .",
    "] moreover , the exceptional set is always @xmath25-flat .",
    "a @xmath26-plane is , by definition , a singleton in @xmath27 .",
    "note that the result fails for any essentially flat set @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath4 essentially @xmath0-flat , then we may find an @xmath0-plane @xmath17 such that @xmath28 .",
    "write @xmath29 the first set on the right is @xmath21 null , since @xmath30 .",
    "for every @xmath31 , the second one is a subset of an @xmath25-sphere .",
    "hence @xmath32 for every @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , the exceptional set can be an @xmath25-plane .",
    "for this just take any two @xmath0-planes @xmath33 and @xmath34 such that @xmath35 but @xmath36 is non - empty .",
    "now @xmath3 is an @xmath25-plane .",
    "define @xmath37 .",
    "then , for every @xmath38 , the radial projection @xmath39 consists of two @xmath25-spheres .",
    "hence , @xmath32 for every @xmath38 .",
    "the main result is a consequence of the following lemma , which concerns the local bilipschitz - properties of the radial projection .",
    "[ lemma1 ] let @xmath40 be a @xmath41-embedding , and let @xmath42 be a point such that @xmath43 . then ,",

    "we may and will assume that @xmath47 .",
    "write @xmath48 , and fix @xmath49 . since @xmath50 is differentiable at @xmath51 , say , we have @xmath52({\\mathbf{y}}- { \\mathbf{z } } ) + { \\varepsilon}({\\mathbf{y}}- { \\mathbf{z}})|{\\mathbf{y}}- { \\mathbf{z}}| , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 is , as usual , some function with the property that @xmath54 as @xmath55 in @xmath56 .",
    "denote the three vectors on the previous line by @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath43 , we have the inequality @xmath59 for some @xmath60 . on the other hand , choosing @xmath61 and @xmath62 close to @xmath47 ensures that @xmath63 and @xmath51 are close to @xmath64 , since @xmath50 is an embedding .",
    "it follows that @xmath65    as soon as @xmath66 . above @xmath67",

    "the angle formed by any points @xmath95 and @xmath96 on @xmath97 is precisely @xmath83 , and this angle is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath98 .",
    "thus @xmath99 hence @xmath100 restricted to @xmath101 is bilipschitz .",
    "choose a @xmath14-embedding @xmath102 so that @xmath103 intersects @xmath4 in a set of positive @xmath10 measure .",
    "next choose a point @xmath104 such that @xmath105 and @xmath106 is a density point of @xmath107 .",
    "all this is possible by sard s theorem and the fact that @xmath10 almost every point of @xmath107 is a density point .",
    "write @xmath108 . by our assumption , @xmath109 .",
    "now repeat the previous procedure : choose a @xmath14-embedding @xmath110 such that @xmath111 intersects @xmath112 in a set of positive @xmath10 measure .",
