    "interest in the optical emission from isolated neutron stars ( inss ) has been growing , as recent improvements in detector sensitivity have enabled these faint sources to be observed .",
    "optical observations of neutron stars are important for providing an understanding of pulsar emission mechanisms and allowing direct observations of the energy spectrum of the electron pair plasma . to date 6 inss",
    "have been detected in the optical .",
    "evidence suggests that it is the age and/or the period derivative of the ins , rather than its period , that determines the optical , and indeed multiwavelength , emission from an ins ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "psr 1509 - 58 was initially identified by its x - ray emission ( @xcite ) and shortly afterwards a radio signal , with a period of 150ms , was detected ( @xcite ) .",
    "later studies showed that it had a large @xmath2 ( 1.5 x 10@xmath3 ss@xmath4 ) , in fact the largest known . the pulsar has had its second period derivative measured giving a breaking index ( @xmath5 ) of 2.83 @xmath6 ( @xcite ) in close agreement with the expectations of a radiating dipole ( n=3 ) .",
    "its magnetic field ( @xmath7 ) is the largest known and its age 1,600 , second only to the crab pulsar in youth .",
    "its age and location make its association with snr msh 15 - 52 ( @xcite ) at a distance of 4.2 kpc ( @xcite ) likely , although this position has been challenged by @xcite , who has proposed a greater distance , 5.9 kpc , based upon radio dispersion and x - ray spectra of the extended emission around the pulsar .",
    "it has also been observed in soft gamma - rays ( @xcite ) and a tentative optical counterpart has been proposed with @xmath8 ( @xcite ) . when taken at a distance of 4.2 kpc",
    "the optical observations indicate an absolute magnitude of m@xmath9@xmath10 ( including the effects of interstellar extinction ) , fainter than the crab pulsar .",
    "however , it is much brighter than would be expected from phenomenological models which have been successful in describing the x - ray emission from psr 1509 - 58 ( pacini and savati 1987 ) .",
    "this over - luminosity makes its behaviour similar to the older optical pulsars , psr0656 + 14 ( @xcite ) and geminga ( @xcite ) .",
    "observations of any pulsed optical component will be crucial in determining what fraction of the emission is thermal and what is magnetospheric .",
    "only the magnetospheric emission would be expected to scale in a manner analogous to that described by pacini and savati . indeed , by considering plausible emission mechanisms ( lu et al 1994 ) and high energy observations ( @xcite )",
    ", it would be reasonable to expect that most of the emission would be non - thermal .    given the importance of a correct determination of the optical emision from psr1509 - 58 , we have made time - resolved observations in an attempt to confirm its identification and determine the optical pulsed fraction .",
    "the observations were made on 1995 february 2425th using university college galway s triffid camera mounted at the nasmyth focus of the eso 3.5 m new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla , chile .",
    "both nights were photometric .",
    "the triffid system consists of a multianode microchannel array ( mama ) 2-dimensional photon counting detector with a b extended s-20 photocathode ( @xcite ) and a fast data collection system ( @xcite ) .",
    "the position and time - of - arrival of each photon are recorded to a precision of 25@xmath11 m and 1@xmath11s , respectively .",
    "absolute timing is achieved using a gps receiver and an ovened 10-mhz crystal . on the ntt",
    "the 1024@xmath12256-pixel array had an equivalent spatial resolution of @xmath13 pixel@xmath4 .",
    "observations were made with standard b and v filters .",
    "the crab pulsar and photometric standard stars were observed each night for calibration purposes and to ensure that the system was working correctly .",
    "the pulsar observations are summarised in table 1 .",
    "lcccc date & utc & filter & duration & seeing + ( 1995 ) & & & ( s ) & + feb 24 & 07:25:43 & v & 2600 & @xmath14 + feb 24 & 08:51:46 & v & 5100 & @xmath15 + feb 25 & 07:39:49 & b & 6250 & @xmath16 +",
    "the data were first binned into 1 ms frames and divided by a deep flatfield taken during the observations .",
    "a post - exposure shift - and - add sharpening technique was applied to produce an integrated image ( @xcite ) .",
    "because of the large telescope aperture ( @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is fried s parameter ) , this does not produce any significant improvement in the image above the seeing limit , but corrects for effects such as telescope wobble .",
    "the optical candidate was identified in both the integrated b and v images .",
    "photometry was carried out using the iraf daophot package , with the background level being determined as the mean of the signal in an annulus of radius @xmath19 and width @xmath20 centred on the candidate position .",
    "photon times were extracted from a window with a diameter equal to the seeing width centred on the pulsar candidate .",
    "this choice of window diameter maximises the signal to noise .",
    "the time series was translated to the solar - system barycentre using the jpl de200 ephemeris and then folded in phase using the psr 1509 - 58 ephemeris of ( @xcite ) ( table 2 ) .",
    "the resulting light curves were analysed using the @xmath21 statistic ( @xcite ) .",

    "the optical counterpart ( @xmath28 ) proposed by caraveo et al .",
    "( 1994b ) can clearly be seen in v ( 14@xmath29 ) and , with less significance , in b(4@xmath29 ) .",
    "we find the pulsar candidate has magnitudes @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "this is to be compared with previous estimates @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the measurements were calculated from a combination of the counting statistics as well as any systematic error in the flat - fielding .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show contour plots of the pulsar candidate .",
    "3.3truein    3.3truein    no pulsations were seen ( to the 1% significance level ) in any of the time - series data sets .",
    "an upper limit for the pulsed fraction was calculated for the b and v emission assuming , conservatively , a duty cycle in the optical of 50% .",
    "the 3@xmath29 upper limits were found to be @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "these correspond to pulsed fractions @xmath36 in v and @xmath37 in b. for comparison the crab pulsar has a pulsed fraction of @xmath38 and vela @xmath39 . at the reported pulsar distance of 4.2 kpc ( @xmath40 ) ,",
    "the measured b - v of 2.1 is equivalent to an intrinsic colour ( b - v)@xmath41 and absolute magnitude @xmath42 , somewhat redder and fainter than the crab pulsar . at 4.2 kpc",
    "this would be equivalent to a g type main sequence star .",
    "our dervived magnitudes and colours , when combined with the lack of optical pulsations , cast doubt on the caraveo et al ( 1994b ) candidate being the optical counterpart of psr 1509 - 58 .",
    "our data is consistent with an m type main sequence star at a distance of about 2 kpc . alternatively ,",
    "if it is the pulsar then the pulsed fraction must be anomolously low ( lower than any other optical pulsar ) and most of the radiation thermal .",
    "this is contrast with higher energy observations ( dominated by non - thermal emission ) , where the pulsed fraction increases with decreasing energy ( @xcite ) .",
    "however if the optical emission represents the rayleigh - jeans tail of the neutron star s black body spectrum , then with tabulated values for extinction towards msh15 - 52 , the distance would have to be @xmath43 1 kpc assuming a surface temperature of @xmath44 k in contrast to the expected distance of at least 4.2 kpc .",
    "the presence of a neutron star atmosphere ( @xcite ) would not change this distance sufficiently to explain the optical excess .",
    "if the radiation is non - thermal then it is difficult to imagine a geometry and a mechanism which would give such an anomolously low pulsed fraction and still be consistent with high energy observations . even at the distance derived from radio dispersion ( 5.9 kpc )",
    "the star is still too red to be explained by a thermal extrapolation alone .",
    "a final answer to the nature of this star will come from spectroscopy - its magnitude is well within the capabilities of the vlt .",
