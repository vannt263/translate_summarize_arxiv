    ".    * motivation and historical overview .",
    "* there is a significant body of work related in one way or another to counting solutions of difference polynomial equations over algebraic closures of finite fields equipped with powers of the frobenius automorphism .",
    "firstly , since counting the number of solutions of polynomial equations over finite fields is a special case , it subsumes the amazing achievements of grothendieck s circle around the weil conjectures and deligne s proof of the riemann hypothesis over finite fields .",
    "given a well - known translation mechanism between the languages of difference equations and algebraic correspondences ( as expounded in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* [ s : diff - pro ] ) ) , the work of pink @xcite , fujiwara @xcite and varshavsky @xcite on deligne s conjecture regarding the number of fixed points of correspondences twisted by powers of frobenius is highly relevant .",
    "however , due to the strong properness assumptions these authors require to prove a very precise trace formula , these results can not be applied to a general difference polynomial system . without the restrictive assumptions , hrushovski produced an ingenious yet very difficult proof of a difference analogue of the lang - weil estimate for the number of points on a difference scheme over fields with frobenii @xcite .",
    "inspired by these considerations , we embarked on a progamme to develop _ difference algebraic geometry _ to the level where it reveals the fine number - theoretic information regarding numbers of points of difference schemes over fields with frobenii . in the first instance",
    ", we aim to generalise the techniques developed by fried , jarden et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite over finite fields , collectively known under the name of _ galois stratification_. the techniques around the theorem of chebotarev developed in this paper are crucial for this work , and the development of _ twisted _ galois stratification is described in the follow - up paper @xcite .",
    "one of the main obstacles was that , apart from the pioneering work in @xcite and @xcite , which we quickly review in section  [ strict - dga ] , there are no other attempts of a systematic study of difference algebraic geometry , so all prerequisites would have to be developed from first principles .",
    "monograph @xcite and a recent book by levin @xcite are sources of some of the difference algebra needed .",
    "we must emphasise that a typical difference scheme that arises when studying difference polynomial equations is of _ finite transformal type _ over a difference field ( [ finsigmatype ] ) , but its ambient scheme is of infinite type and thus it falls just beyond the reach of tools and methodology of the classical algebraic geometry .    * a need for generalised difference algebraic geometry . *",
    "the first key observation we made was that the context of _ ordinary _ ( or _ strict _ ) difference schemes ( with a single endomorphism ) is too rigid and does not allow meaningful galois actions , coverings or quotients .",
    "thus we are led into a study of _ generalised difference schemes , _ endowed with a set of ( not necessarily commuting ) endomorphisms , closed under a binary operation of ` conjugation ' .",
    "various authors made attempts to generalise the framework of ordinary difference algebra and geometry .",
    "the treatment of partial difference equations with respect to several commuting endomorphisms in @xcite is too restrictive for our requirements , because we are exactly interested in phenomena arising in the case of _ non - commuting _ endomorphisms .",
    "the authors of @xcite went in the direction of considering not just fixed points of a single endomorphism @xmath23 but also those of its powers @xmath24 .",
    "a similar approach is taken in @xcite , where the author proves a chevalley - type theorem on ( near-)constructibility of images of morphisms of difference schemes ( our version is ( * ? ? ?",
    "* [ chevalley ] ) ) . intuitively , the object that results from a consideration of higher powers @xmath24 is closer to the ambient scheme and is therefore better - behaved .",
    "our approach generalises both of these , and has a very interesting interaction with the latter , our framework being slightly more precise when dealing with galois actions .",
    "section  [ gen - dga ] contains the extensive development of difference algebraic geometry of generalised difference schemes needed to formulate the key notion of a _ galois covering _ of difference schemes in section  [ sect : galois ] .",
    "section  [ ch : ttch ] contains the main results of the paper .",
    "the _ dirichlet density _ is introduced as an analytic density defined by means of _ zeta _ and _ @xmath25-functions _ associated with _",
    "constructible functions _ on galois coverings of difference schemes over fields with frobenii .",
    "this density statement [ main - ch - th ] in its precise formulation [ chebotarev - density ] follows from the trace formula [ trace - formula ] , which is an approximative difference avatar of the classical lefschetz trace formula .",
    "it is proved using hrushovski s twisted lang - weil estimate .",
    "* applications . *",
    "we consider our approach to generalised difference algebra a major advance in its own right , and it should be of intrinsic interest in the difference algebra community , with possible applications to galois theory of difference equations along the lines of @xcite .    moreover , there are other naturally - occurring contexts where it may be advantageous to study objects with several endomorphisms .",
    "in particular , as tom scanlon pointed out , a key step in most approaches to manin - mumford conjecture ( @xcite , for example ) is to find a difference polynomial equation that captures all the relevant torsion points , which is very hard to achieve with a single endomorphism . on the other hand ,",
    "it is much easier to capture all of the torsion if one uses _ two _ endomorphisms .",
    "apart from number theory and algebraic geometry , our results ( especially [ trace - formula ] ) should be of interest in model - theory and logic since , in conjunction with the description of definable sets in terms of galois stratifications from @xcite , they reduce the problem of counting points on definable sets over fields with powers of frobenius to a calculation of ( twisted ) character sums . thus , the present paper can be viewed as a conceptualisation of the ideas of @xcite and @xcite for fields with frobenii . as already mentioned , [ trace - formula ] and its consequence [ twisted - cebotarev ] are used in our subsequent work on galois stratifications in @xcite .",
    "before embarking on a development of _ generalised difference schemes _ in the next section , we include a summary of known results ( @xcite , @xcite ) for difference schemes in the _ strict sense _ for the benefit of the reader .",
