    "a goal of core - collapse supernova theory is to explain the mechanism of explosion .",
    "it is an accepted truism of the field that a necessary condition for this is that complicated multi - dimensional simulation codes incorporating the requisite neutrino , nuclear , and gravitational physics reproduce such explosions robustly , yielding at the very least the requisite asymptotic energies , residual neutron star masses , and nucleosynthesis .",
    "a simple analytic explanation has not been forthcoming and , given the manifest complexities of the process , would not be deemed credible .",
    "it is thought that one litmus test of success would be such a demonstration for a non - rotating model between @xmath08 and @xmath020 m@xmath1 , the progenitor zams mass regime that must provide the lion s share of core - collapse supernova events .",
    "however , to date the various groups engaged in such efforts around the world have failed to agree on the outcomes of the collapse of otherwise similar progenitor massive star cores .",
    "this is despite claims to have embedded the necessary physics and microphysics into the simulations .",
    "in fact , the numerical algorithms , resolutions , and input physics all differ , and even when the physics is deemed similar , the implementations and approximations surely differ . the ornl group ( bruenn et  al .",
    "2013,2016 ) , with their chimera code , uses multi - group flux - limited diffusion ( mgfld ) neutrino transport ( bruenn 1985 ) , the vh-1 newtonian hydrodynamics package , a monopole correction for general relativity ( gr ) ( marek et al .",
    "2006 ) , but multiple one - dimensional solves for multi - dimensional transport using the so - called  ray - by - ray+ \" approach ( buras et al . 2003 ; burrows , hayes , & fryxell 1995 ) .",
    "such a dimensional reduction for the transport , particularly manifest in 2d , ignores lateral , non - radial radiative transport , which has been shown to be of quantitative ( ott et al .",
    "2008 ; brandt et al . 2011 ; burrows 2013 ; dolence , burrows , & zhang 2015 ; sumiyoshi et al . 2015 ) and qualitative ( skinner , burrows , & dolence 2016 ) importance . to the point , skinner et al .",
    "( 2016 ) have shown that the ray - by - ray anomalies in the angular distribution of the radiation field and corresponding neutrino heating rates can reinforce the axial sloshing motions in 2d and push the shock into explosion .",

    "in addition , their shock radii generally decrease from a peak occurring near a time @xmath0200 ms after bounce , before increasing just prior to explosion hundreds of milliseconds later ( and all at different post - bounce times ) . using the vertex - prometheus code ,",
    "the garching group obtained weak explosions in 2d for a 11.2-m@xmath1 progenitor ( buras et al .",
    "2006 ) and for a rotating 15-m@xmath1 progenitor ( marek & janka 2009 ) , though the outcomes when proper correction is made for the corresponding mantle binding energies were not clear .",
    "more recently , the garching group ( summa et al .",
    "2016 ) obtained explosions in 2d for a broad range of woosley & heger ( 2007 ) progenitors from 11 to 28 m@xmath1 , but these calculations as well did not comport with those of the ornl group in the timescales and energies seen .",
    "the garching group has also used for all their multi - d vertex supernova simulations a variant of the problematic ray - by - ray+ dimensionally - reduced transport approach .",
    "however , murphy , dolence , & burrows ( 2013 ) and couch & ott ( 2015 ) , and originally burrows , hayes , & fryxell ( 1995 ) , highlight the importance of turbulent pressure behind the shock as an aid to explosion , but note that such a pressure is larger ( artifically ) in 2d than in 3d .",
    "turbulent pressure is also ( possibly ) more anisotropic in 2d , favoring the radial stress component , further enhancing the prospects ( again , artificially ) for overcoming the accretion ram pressure .",
    "hence , the current explosions in 2d may in part , or at times , be numerical artifacts .",
    "importantly , the recent vertex - prometheus calculations in 3d by the garching group do not explode ( hanke et al .",
    "2013 ; tamborra et al .",
    "2014 ) , even though the corresponding 2d simulations did .",
    "puzzled by this 2d/3d difference , hanke et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have speculated that the sloshing motion oftimes associated in 2d with the sasi ( standing accretion shock instability ) may be crucial to explosion , though in 3d such a pronounced axial sloshing motion is rarely in evidence ( burrows et al .",

    "( 2015 ) do obtain a weak explosion in 3d of the woosley & heger ( 2007 ) 20-m@xmath1 in 3d .",
    "the difference in outcome is due to the consequent decrease in the neutrino - neutron neutral - current scattering cross section in the neutron - rich envelope of the protoneutron star bounded by the stalled shock and the resultant increase in the electron - neutrino luminosity and average energy that are instrumental in heating this envelope .",
    "however , the magnitude of the strangeness correction employed by melson et al . may be larger than experiment allows ( ahmed et al .",
    "furthermore , it is not at all clear that any among these currently published under - powered 3d explosions will actually succeed as an explosion after tranversing the entire star and after the mass cut between ejecta and residual core is determined hydrodynamically .    the calculations of burrows et al .",

    "vulcan/2d did not have all the terms to order @xmath3 in the transport , but castro did , and the results were similar ( dolence , burrows & zhang 2015 ) .",
    "importantly , neither vulcan/2d nor castro made corrections for the effects of general relativity , and this could explain in part the different outcome .",
    "however , since other self - consistent calculations ( summarized previously ) that obtained explosions in 2d used the ray - by - ray scheme , while the vulcan/2d and castro studies did not , one is tempted to suggest that the ray - by - ray approach may in 2d be yielding qualitatively incorrect results .    suwa et al .

    "moreover , in all of these studies the initial rotation rate was not only high in the mantle , but was high in the core .",
    "such rapid initial spins ( periods of a few seconds ) and final spins ( periods of @xmath02@xmath710 milliseconds ) seem not to be consistent with inferred pulsar spin periods at birth ( crudely , @xmath0300 @xmath8 200 milliseconds ; emmering & chevalier 1989 ; faucher - giguere & kaspi 2006 ; popov & turolla 2012 ; noutsos et al .",

    "2007c ) and/or gamma - ray bursts ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "in this paper , we explore , with self - consistent 2d f (  [ method ] ) simulations , the dependence of the outcome of collapse ( most notably whether the model explodes ) on neutrino - nucleon scattering rates ( via modifications of in - medium response corrections due to many - body effects ) , pre - collapse convective perturbations , inelastic neutrino - electron scattering , and inelastic neutrino - nucleon scattering .",
    "we also continue our study , started in skinner et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , of the issues raised by the use of the ray - by - ray+ method .",
    "what we find is that when the protoneutron star bounded by a stalled shock is close to the critical condition for explosion ( burrows & goshy 1993 ) , as it easily can be in the turbulent multi - d context , the sensitivity to explosion of small changes in the physical inputs is amplified . the magnitude of such changes might be only @xmath020% , but the result can be qualitatively different , in particular whether the model explodes . in the 1d ( spherical ) case , the core is not sensitive to comparable changes (  mazurek s law \" ) , but , as we demonstrate in this paper , in the multi - d turbulent ( and chaotic ) context , small changes in the physics can have a qualitative effect on explodability .",
    "this may explain why the various groups around the world simulating core - collapse supernovae can witness very different outcomes , despite the fact that they ostensibly are incorporating almost the same microphysics and similar computational approaches .",
    "small differences are amplified near criticality in this chaotic context .",
    "the availability of a new generation of fast , but accurate , simulation codes , such as f (  [ method ] ) , and significant supercomputer resources enables rapid multi - parameter investigations in the multi - dimensional ( in particular 2d ) , multi - physics context .",
    "such wide - ranging explorations reveal patterns not easily discerned when one ( or only a few ) simulations are the focus of a paper and its ( or their ) results solely are mined .",
    "we have developed an entirely new multi - dimensional , multi - group radiation / hydrodyanmic code , f , for the study of core - collapse supernovae ( skinner , burrows , & dolence 2016 ; dolence , burrows , & skinner 2016 ) .",
    "it employs spherical coordinates in one , two , and three spatial dimensions , solves the comoving - frame , multi - group , two - moment , velocity - dependent transport equations to o(@xmath3 ) , and uses the m1 tensor closure for the second and third moments of the radiation fields ( dubroca & feugeas 1999 ; vaytet et al .",
    "2011 ) . for this paper ,",
    "we focus on two spatial dimensions ( 2d ) and employ a spherical grid . three species of neutrino ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and  @xmath4 \" [ @xmath4 , @xmath11 , @xmath5 , and @xmath12 lumped together ] ) are followed using an explicit godunov characteristic method applied to the radiation transport operators , but an implicit solver for the radiation source terms . in this way ,",
    "the radiative transport and transfer are handled locally , without the need for a global solution on the entire mesh .",
    "this is also the recent approach taken by just , obergaulinger , & janka ( 2015 ) and oconnor & couch ( 2015 ) , though with some important differences . by addressing the transport operator with an explicit method",
    ", we significantly reduce the computational complexity and communication overhead of traditional multi - dimensional radiative transfer solutions by bypassing the need for global iterative solvers that have proven to be slow and/or problematic beyond @xmath010,000 cores .",
    "strong scaling of the transport solution in three dimensions using f is excellent beyond 100,000 cores on cray architectures ( dolence , burrows , & skinner 2016 ) .",
    "the light - crossing time of a zone generally sets the timestep , but since the speed of light and the speed of sound in the inner core are not far apart in the core - collapse problem after bounce , this numerical stability constraint on the timestep is similar to the cfl constraint of the explicit hydrodynamics .",
    "radiation quantities are reconstructed with linear profiles , and the calculated edge states are used to determine fluxes via an hlle solver . in the non - hyprebolic regime ,",
    "the hlle fluxes are corrected to reduce numerical diffusion ( oconnor & ott 2013 ) . the momentum and energy transfer between the radiation and the gas are operator - split from the transport and addressed implicitly .",
    "the hydrodynamics in f is based on a directionally - unsplit godunov - type finite - volume method .",
    "fluxes at cell faces are computed with the fast and accurate hllc approximate riemann solver based on left and right states reconstructed from the underlying volume - averaged states .",
    "the reconstruction is accomplished via a novel algorithm we developed specifically for f that uses moments of the coordinates within each cell and the volume - averaged states to reconstruct tvd - limited parabolic profiles , while requiring one less  ghost cell \" than the standard ppm approach .",
    "the profiles always respect the cells volume averages and , in smooth parts of the solution away from extrema , yield third - order accurate states on the faces . to eliminate the carbuncle and related odd - even coupling phenomenon , f specifically detects strong , grid - aligned shocks and employs in neighboring cells hlle , rather than hllc , fluxes that introduce a small amount of smoothing in the transverse direction .    without gravity , the coupled set of radiation / hydrodynamic equations conserves energy and momentum to machine accuracy .",
    "with gravity , energy conservation is excellent before and after core bounce .",
    "however , as with all other supernova codes , at bounce the total energy as defined in integral form glitches by @xmath13 ergs ( dolence , burrows , & skinner 2016 ) ergs . ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that the gravitational terms are handled in the momentum and energy equations as source terms and are not in conservative divergence form .",
    "the code is written in a covariant / coordinate - independent fashion , with generalized connection coefficients , and so can employ any coordinate mapping .",
    "this facilitates the use of any logically - cartesian coordinate system and , if necessary , the artful distribution of zones . in the interior , to alleviate courant limits due to converging angular zones , the code can deresolve in angle with decreasing radius , conserving hydrodynamic and radiative fluxes in a manner similar to the method employed in amr codes at refinement boundaries .",
    "gravity is handled in 2d and 3d with a monopole or a multipole solver ( mller & steimetz 1995 ) .",
    "when using the latter , we generally set the maximum spherical harmonic order necessary equal to twelve .",
    "the monopole gravitational term is altered to accommodate approximate general - relativistic gravity ( marek et al .",
    "2006 ) , and we employ the metric terms , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , derived from this potential to incorporate general relativistic redshift effects in the neutrino transport equations ( in the manner of rampp & janka 2002 ; see also skinner et al .",
    "the appendix describes our approach to gr in more detail . in 2d , rotation and a third component of the velocity vector",
    "can be included in the hydrodynamics .",
    "we use the k = 220 mev lattimer - swesty equation of state ( eos ) for all simulations presented in this paper ( lattimer & swesty 1991 ) .",
    "for these simulations , we follow twenty energy ( @xmath16 ) groups for each of the @xmath9 , @xmath17 , and @xmath4 species . for the @xmath9 types ,",
    "the neutrino energy @xmath16 varies logarithmically from 1 mev to 300 mev , while it varies from 1 mev to 100 mev for the @xmath17s and @xmath4s .",

    ", such effects are known to be important at higher densities and relevant to long - term ( many seconds ) protoneutron star cooling , but may also play an important role in the neutrino decoupling region and in the explosion mechanism .",
    "@xmath23 is less than one by as much as tens of percent and generally results in perceptively higher neutrino luminosities and average energies in the early supernova phase for all neutrino species .",
    "the effect of @xmath23 can be larger than the similar and corresponding effect of weak magnetism on the neutrino - nucleon scattering rate .",
    "melson et al . ( 2015 ) invoked a modification in the axial - vector coupling constant ( @xmath2 ) due to a possible strangeness contribution to the nucleon spin of @xmath26 .",
    "this results in an approximate decrease in the neutrino - nucleon scattering rate of @xmath020% and in melson et al . the consequence was an explosion in 3d , even though they did not witness an explosion in 3d when using their default microphysical suite . curiously , without their strangeness correction , the same model exploded in 2d .",
    "however , the value of the correction , @xmath27 , they employed in their 3d model is likely too large and @xmath27 may be closer to zero ( ahmed et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "many - body corrections to neutral - current and charged - current neutrino - nucleon interactions have been discussed in the past ( burrows & sawyer 1998,1999 ; hannestad & raffelt 1998 ; reddy et al .",
    "1999 ; roberts et al .",
    "2012 ) in the context of protoneutron stars and supernovae , and have been known to affect the neutrino - matter reaction rates .",
    "burrows & sawyer ( 1998 ) in particular suggested that many - body corrections to the axial - vector and vector structure factors for neutrino - nucleon scattering could be of a magnitude sufficent to be of relevance to the viability of the neutrino - driven mechanism of core - collapse supernovae , but did not provide a robust estimate of the magnitude of this diminution much below nuclear densities .",
    "importantly , horowitz et al . ( 2016 ) have recently generalized their virial expansion approach to the nuclear - matter equation of state to estimate the axial - vector structure factor ( @xmath23 ) of nuclear matter at lower densities ( @xmath28 g @xmath25 ) , where it may have a bearing on the neutrino - driven mechanism .",
    "the fit derived by horowitz et al .",
    "( 2016 ) to the structure factor applied to @xmath29 translates into a decrease in the neutrino - nucleon scattering cross section in the crucial region at and deeper than the various neutrinospheres of @xmath05% to @xmath035% .",
    "this effect is a function of density , temperature , and electron fraction ( @xmath30 ) and is comparable to , and can be larger than , the supposed strangeness correction invoked by melson et al .",
    "horowitz et al . ( 2016 ) state ( without calculating ) that the corresponding structure factor for the vector current is likely greater than one , but since the vector contribution to neutrino - nucleon scattering is small , this is likely to be subdominant .",
    "the upshot is a potentially important , and physically plausible , decrease in the neutrino - matter scattering rates that translates into an increase in the driving @xmath9 and @xmath17 luminosities and average energies , thereby increasing the heating rate in the gain region .",
    "we show here for the first time that this augmentation , well - motivated by physics , makes explosions easier in multi - d ( here 2d ) models of the neutrino mechanism of core - collapse supernovae .",
    "this many - body effect is mostly due to the increase in the @xmath4 luminosity occasioned by the decrease in the associated @xmath31 scattering cross section for densities above @xmath010@xmath32 g @xmath25 ; this causes a further compression in the core .",
    "such a compression , similar to the effect of gr , raises the temperatures near the @xmath9 and @xmath17 neutrinospheres , thereby raising their associated luminosities and average emergent neutrino energies .",
    "these changes increase the neutrino - matter heating rates in the gain region and , hence , facilitate explosion .",
    "since the super - allowed charged - current absorption reactions still dominate the @xmath9/@xmath17-matter interaction rates , the direct effect of this structure factor correction to the axial - vector term in the neutrino - nucleon scattering rate on the @xmath9 and @xmath17 luminosities is modest .",
    "we note that the corresponding correction for charged - current interactions may be in the same direction ( fischer 2016 ; burrows & sawyer 1999 , although see roberts et al .",
    "2012 ) and could also be important .",
    "the correction would be small at low densities in the gain region , but higher deeper inside , where the neutrinospheres reside .",
    "if the rates are suppressed , this could increase the @xmath9 and @xmath17 luminosities , while simultaneously not decreasing the heating in the gain region and is not like a uniform correction at all radii .",
    "such behavior , if it obtains , would be near optimal for aiding the explosion , and we will explore this correction to the charged - current interaction rates in subsequent work .",
    "figure [ mean_shock ] is the first in a series of figures we have generated for this paper depicting the time evolution of the mean shock radius with time after bounce of the 20-m@xmath1 progenitor model of woosley & heger ( 2007 ) .",
    "we choose the 20-m@xmath1 model only for specificity .",
    "while the quantitative results differ for other progenitors , the qualitative results are similar .",
    "one of the central results that can be gleaned from such figures is the time of explosion .",
    "this quantity can help one gauge the relative role of the inputs in question .",
    "the focus of figure [ mean_shock ] is on the effect of the inclusion of the many - body structure - factor correction .",

    "almost all models explode eventually . however , the time to explosion can vary significantly with inputs . while there are many combinatoric possibilities , we have settled on just a few pairwise comparisons to demonstrate the effects we see universally .",
    "figure [ 1d ] depicts the post - bounce evolution of many of the same models performed in 1d .",

    "figure [ mean_shock ] highlights the significant role the axial - vector structure factor correction of horowitz et al .",
    "( 2016 ) plays in the time of explosion .",
    "the thick black arrow connects two full - gr models , one with inelastic neutrino - electron and neutrino - nucleon scattering included with the full default suite of elastic scattering and absorption processes and the other adding the many - body correction on top of this . while the first model explodes , adding in the many - body correction decreases the post - bounce time to explosion by @xmath0150 milliseconds . in figure",
    "[ mean_shock ] , we also compare an ies - only and an ies@xmath34 mb model . here , the effect of adding the many - body correction is larger .",
    "the slight increase in the heating in the gain region due to the inclusion of inelastic neutrino - electron and neutrino - nucleon scattering is helpful , but the effect of the many - body correction is larger .",
    "figure [ mb_combined ] compares the emergent neutrino luminosities ( left panel ) and root - mean - square ( rms ) neutrino energies ( right ) for these two models .",
    "the boosting in the @xmath4 luminosity and rms energy is clearly manifest , as are the corresponding boosts in those quantities for the @xmath9 and @xmath17 neutrinos .",
    "while one may have speculated that enhanced neutrino losses , particularly due to @xmath4s that are almost ineffectual in heating the shocked mantle , would have had a negative effect on explodability , the converse is true .",
    "greater losses lead to a further compaction of the core with an increase in the matter temperatures near the @xmath9 and @xmath17 neutrinospheres .",
    "the result is similar in effect to that of gr , whereby such core heating enhances the driving @xmath9 and @xmath17 luminosities and the average neutrino energies , which in turn enhance the heating power in the gain region .",
    "since it is this power deposition that ultimately drives explosions , the net effect is quite supportive of explosion .",
    "however , the actual magnitude and form of the correction to the axial - vector coupling term in the expression for the neutrino - nucleon scattering rate may be different from that derived by horowitz et al . ( 2016 ) and this still needs to be verified .",
    "moreover , the effects of similar many - body corrections to the absorption rates need to be incorporated , as do those for the vector coupling strengths",
    ". one prediction of the consequence of the structure - factor correction we have employed is the enhanced @xmath4 luminosities and average energies seen in figure [ mb_combined ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that , as it stands , the effect on the outcome of core - collapse of many - body rate suppressions ( burrows & sawyer 1998,1999 ) might be large .",
    "if more careful analyses partially mute the magnitude of the effect we have highlighted here , the resultant explosion times might then populate the gap shown in figure [ mean_shock ] between the the model with inelastic neutrino - electron and neutrino - nucleon scattering alone and that including the current horowitz et al .",
    "( 2016 ) correction .",
    "in addition , the @xmath4 luminosity and neutrino energy boosts seen in figure [ mb_combined ] might be more modest .",
    "this all remains to be determined .",
    "neutrino - electron scattering rates and cross sections are much smaller than those for neutrino - nucleon scattering , which themselves are smaller still than those for super - allowed charged - current reactions such as @xmath35 . for @xmath36 mev ,",
    "this deficit is approximately two orders of magnitude .",
    "however , due to the small mass of the electron , the energy transfer to the matter during a ",
    "compton - like \" neutrino - electron scattering is on average quite large , while , due to the large mass of the nucleon , the corresponding average energy transfer during neutrino - nucleon scattering is rather small .",
    "therefore , the large cross section for neutrino - nucleon scattering multiplied by the small associated energy transfer can be comparable to the product of the small neutrino - electron cross section with the large per - interaction energy transfer and depend upon temperature , density , and neutrino energy ( janka et al . 1996 ; thompson , burrows , & horvath 2000 ) .",
    "the upshot is that inelastic scattering off both electrons and nucleons can modify thermal profiles and heating rates exterior to the neutrinospheres and in the gain region and contribute to explosion by the neutrino heating mechanism .",
    "moreover , mller et al . ( 2012b )",
    "make the point that heating by @xmath4-nucleon inelastic energy transfer can boost the temperatures near the @xmath9 and @xmath17 neutrinospheres and results in slightly higher @xmath9 and @xmath17 energy luminosities , which in turn enhance heating behind the shock correspondingly .",
    "our calculations corroborate this effect .    the detailed theory of the structure functions and redistribution kernels for such inelastic scattering , including the effects of final - state blocking and the thermal spectrum of the targets , can be found in burrows , reddy , & thompson ( 2006 ) , reddy et al .",

    "pioneering work on inelastic scattering off electrons in the core - collapse context can be found in bruenn ( 1985 ) and mezzacappa & bruenn ( 1993 ) . however , those latter papers were focussed on the downscattering effect due to inelastic @xmath9-@xmath37 scattering on the electron neutrinos produced during infall and the consequent decrease in the trapped lepton fraction . since a larger trapped lepton fraction could help facilitate immediate post - bounce explosions ( burrows & lattimer 1983 ) ,",
    "this quantity was more relevant when the prompt hydrodynamic supernova mechanism still seemed viable .",
    "however , with the emergence of the delayed , neutrino - driven mechanism ( bethe & wilson 1985 ) , and the conclusion that the prompt mechanism could not work due to catastrophic neutrino losses at and around shock breakout , the value of the trapped lepton fraction , and its precise value , receded in significance .    nevertheless , heating behind the stalled shock due to inelastic energy transfer from neutrinos to both electrons and nucleons , or boosting the @xmath9 and @xmath17 luminosities by @xmath4 downscattering near their neutrinospheres ( mller et al .",
    "2012b ) , may help achieve the critical condition for explosion , particularly when in concert with the inclusion of the in - medium neutrino response ( horowitz et al .",
    "2016 ;  [ horo ] ) and the slightly net positive influence of gr .",
    "heating by inelastic neutrino - electron scattering is still sub - dominant with respect to that due to charged - current @xmath9 and @xmath17 absorption , and in 1d ( spherical ) simulations there is almost no hydrodynamic consequence of its inclusion ( thompson , burrows , & pinto 2003 ) .",
    "the same can be said of inelastic neutrino - nucleon scattering ( janka et al . 1996 ; burrows & sawyer 1998,1999 ; thompson , burrows , & horvath 2000 ) .",
    "however , in the realistic multi - d context of the core - collapse phenomenon , the cumulative effect of the addition of a few sub - dominant heating mechanisms , compression due to enhanced @xmath4 neutrino losses and consequent @xmath9 and @xmath17 neutrinosphere heating , and greater proximity to the critical condition due to multi - d effects amplifies the leverage of even small additions to the gain - region heating power over their effects individually and can convert an anemic explosion into a robust explosion , or even a dud into a blast .",
    "one recalls that the original delayed mechanism of wilson required for explosion only a modest enhancement of @xmath025% in the neutrino luminosity .    for inelastic scattering off electrons of all neutrino species we use the formalism of thompson , burrows , & pinto ( 2006 ) , with the special - relativistic corrections in reddy et al .",
    "for inelastic scattering and energy redistribution of @xmath9s and @xmath17s off nucleons , we use the formalism of burrows & sawyer ( 1998 ) , but for inelastic scattering of @xmath4 off nucleons we use an approximate approach advocated by mller & janka ( 2015 ) .",
    "however , from the work of thompson , burrows , & horvath ( 2000 ) and tubbs ( 1979 ) , we find that the crossover energy between upscattering and downscattering is nearer 6@xmath38 ( not 3@xmath38 , as in mller & janka ) , where @xmath39 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath40 is the temperature , around densities of @xmath010@xmath41 g",
    "@xmath25 to @xmath010@xmath24 g @xmath25 and so our approximate redistribution rate for @xmath4s is proportional to @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the @xmath4 scattering opacity and @xmath44 is the neutron mass .",
    "figure [ mean_shock_ins ] is the same as figure [ mean_shock ] , but highlights the comparison between two different models , one with inelastic scattering off electrons and the other with inelastic scattering off both electrons and nucleons .",
    "one sees that the time to explosion of this 20-m@xmath1 model is clearly shortened by inelastic neutrino - nucleon scattering effects .",
    "figure [ ies_ins_compare ] compares the neutrino luminosity evolution for these two models .",
    "inelastic scattering off nucleons lowers the @xmath4 luminosity , while the corresponding quantities for the @xmath9 and @xmath17 are slightly increased .",
    "the latter responses explain the positive effect on explodability of the inclusion of inelastic scattering off nucleons .",
    "we emphasize that the direct effect of such inelasticity is in the core , and that the effect in the shocked mantle is indirect .",
    "including only inelastic neutrino - electron scattering , our 20-m@xmath1 model explodes , but late ( after @xmath00.9 seconds ) . including both inelastic neutrino - electron scattering and inelastic neutrino - nucleon scattering , the 20-m@xmath1 model explodes significantly earlier .",
    "however , as shown on figure [ mean_shock_benchmark ] in  [ benchmark ] below , without the many - body correction , our 12- and 15-m@xmath1 models do not explode within 1.0 seconds of bounce .",
    "these models explode only when the many - body structure factor decrease in the scattering rates is accounted for ( and in fact even without incorporating neutrino - nucleon inelasticity ) .",
    "this emphasizes both the important roles of many - body effects and ( perhaps ) perturbations (  [ perturb ] ) in igniting those  lighter \" stars , and that compactness ratio (  [ compact ] ) , for which the lighter models should have an advantage , is not necessarily a good measure of explodability .",
    "performing the last stages of stellar evolution before collapse hydrodynamically in 2d and 3d has been shown to alter , perhaps in significant ways , the compositional , entropy , and density profiles of the core ( meakin et al .",
    "2011 ; couch et al . 2015 ; chatzopoulos et al . 2016 ; mller et al . 2016 ; abdikamalov et al .",
    "2016 ) , and it has long been known that progenitor density profiles have an impact on the outcome of collapse .",
    "this is implicit in the critical curve analysis of burrows & goshy ( 1993 ) , where @xmath45 and the accretion ram pressure play central roles .",
    "it is also a factor in discussions of the compactness parameter ( oconnor & ott 2011 ) and its extensions ( ertl et al . 2015 ) . in this vein ,",

    ".    however , when spherical supernova models are wanting , the initial perturbation spectrum in the progenitor s convective silicon and oxygen zones will certainly affect the timescales for the generation of turbulence behind the stalled shock and may be a factor in the onset of explosion ( couch & ott 2013 ; mller & janka 2015 ; couch et al .",
    "2015 ; abdikamalov et al .",
    "specifically , the magnitude , character , and spectra of seed perturbations will affect how quickly turbulence reaches the non - linear regime and , perhaps , whether turbulence grows to non - linearity at all during the finite time the accreta are in the unstable gain region .",
    "therefore , introducing physically - motivated seed perturbations that originate from and reflect the three - dimensional character of the convective core of an actual massive star at its terminal stage of evolution is a topic of some interest .",
    "however , most calculations done to date do not start with true 3d convective structures , but with 1d models from the literature , and impose either ad hoc perturbations in density or velocity randomly at the grid level or allow grid asphericities ( such as obtain when using a cartesian grid ) or truncation errors to act as seeds .",
    "neither of these approaches is physical , and the resulting initial perturbation spectra lead to early growth rates in the linear regime that reflect not the multi - d progenitor perturbation structure , but the numerical development of convenient artificial power spectra .",
    "this will affect how quickly turbulence reaches the non - linear regime and , perhaps , whether turbulence grows to non - linearity at all during the finite time the accreta are in the unstable gain region .",
    "in addition , this may have a bearing on the post - bounce delay to a turbulence - aided explosion , with the consequent effect on the time and energy of that explosion .",
    "therefore , the seed perturbations that arise during oxygen and silicon burning prior to collapse might be key inputs into core - collapse supernova theory , and couch & ott ( 2013 ) , mller & janka ( 2015 ) , couch et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , and mller ( 2016 ) have begun to explore this . however , mixing - length theory , though inadequate as a comprehensive theory , still provides a measure of the magnitude of velocity perturbations at the onset of collapse ( mller et al . 2016 ) , and they are only a few hundred to @xmath0500 km s@xmath47 , with mach numbers bounded by @xmath00.08 ( woosley & heger 2007 ) .",
    "this is not large .    in this section",
    ", we provide a glimpse at the possible relative role of significant perturbations on the timing and character of explosion in light of the other physics . to this end",
    ", we employ the methodology of mller & janka ( 2015 ) .",
    "these authors impose a vector velocity perturbation map on their progenitor that is more realistic than many past approaches and renders a perturbation field that is independent of grid resolution .",
    "this ( surprisingly ) was rarely attempted in the past and provides a specific context for future comparison .",
    "we set the maximum perturbation speed on the grid to 1000 km s@xmath47 , which as indicated earlier may be near or beyond the expected upper end of the range , a spherical harmonic index @xmath48 of 2 , and a radial  quantum number \" @xmath49 of 5 .",
    "both @xmath48 and @xmath49 are parameters in the mller & janka ( 2015 ) formulation . with this parameter set ,",
    "we simulate in 2d the self - consistent multi - group evolution of a 20-m@xmath1 progenitor and compare the result to a default model for which the initial perturbations are much smaller and arose numerically from grid noise .",
    "figure [ mean_shock_pert ] provides a comparison of two 20-m@xmath1 models : one with and one without the initial perturbation structure discussed above .",
    "this pair of models incorporates gr and inelastic neutrino - electron scattering , but neither the many - body correction nor inelastic neutrino - nucleon scattering .",
    "however , on figure [ mean_shock_pert ] we also include a comparison of two other models : one with gr and inelastic scattering off both electrons and nucleons and the other also with the same imposed perturbations . in figure [ mean_shock_pert ] ,",
    "comparison of the first pair of models demonstrates that when the baseline model includes only the small effect of inelastic neutrino - electron scattering , the effect of large perturbations on top of that baseline model is quite positive .",
    "when inelastic scattering off both electrons and nucleons is included , perturbations have even more leverage .",
    "the result in both cases is a decrease in explosion time of many hundreds of milliseconds .",
    "providing the unstable flow in the gain region seed perturbations of sufficient magnitude ensures growth to fully non - linear turbulence , with the associated stress , during the finite - time traversal of the accreted matter through the crucial gain region . we conclude that imposed progenitor perturbations ,",
    "while not determinative of explosion , can in principle facilitate it and shorten its post - bounce emergence time .",
    "when things are marginal , seed perturbations may make a difference .",
    "however , we also find that models that already explode robustly and early are not much aided by the imposition of seed perturbations in the initial models .",
    "we note that the initial perturbations we imposed have an amplitude that is somewhat larger than expected ( mller et al .",
    "2016 ) and that their character is still rather artificial .",
    "the magnitude of the initial perturbations may well be lower , but their character and magnitude will certainly vary from progenitor to progenitor .",
    "models with weaker initial seed perturbations may well populate the wide gap seen in figure [ mean_shock_pert ] .",
    "therefore , a much more thorough study with 3d progenitors and 3d collapse models is called for .",
    "be that as it may , none of the 2d explosion models we simulated that included all the microphysics , including the many - body correction and inelasticity , were enabled by such physically - motivated progenitor perturbations .",
    "they were , however , marginally facilitated .",
    "as stated earlier , and as shown by skinner et al . ( 2016 ) , the ray - by - ray+ approach to neutrino transport , whereby multi - d transport is replaced by multiple 1d transport calculations with corrections for matter advection , but not lateral transport , can introduce systematic errors in the heating rates along the poles in axisymmetric 2d simulations . such enhancements , when in proximity to criticality , may be producing explosions artificially . at the very least , the time to explosion is artificially shortened , perhaps significantly . since there is little or no accumulation of explosion energy prior to global instability ( burrows , hayes , & fryxell 1995 )",
    ", an earlier explosion may make more of the emitted neutrinos available for explosive driving .",
    "figure [ mean_shock_rbr ] highlights comparisons of two pairs of gr models , one pair with inelastic neutrino - electron scattering and the other pair with inelastic scattering off both electrons and nucleons .",
    "each set contrasts the results with the full multi - d transport capabilities of f and the corresponding ray - by - ray+ method .",
    "the ray - by - ray+ models explode as much as @xmath0500 and @xmath0200 milliseconds , respectively , earlier .",
    "ray - by - ray+ models that also include the many - body structure - factor correction and inelasticity on both electrons and nucleons explode even earlier , but the additional shift in explosion time is not as great .",
    "in fact , the effect of using the ray - by - ray+ transport approach , but without the many - body correction , is similar to the effect of the many - body correction when using more realistic 2d transport .",
    "one is left to speculate whether 2d simulations in the literature that employ ray - by - ray+ , but do nt include our many - body suppression term , would indeed explode if they used more realistic transport .",
    "this is all the more relevant in 3d , given that extant published models that do explode in 2d have more difficulty exploding in 3d , a context in which it is not clear that the ray - by - ray+ method introduces as great an artifact as in 2d .",
    "it is true that the turbulent pressure spectra in 2d and 3d are different , with the turbulent cascade in 2d resulting in enhanced stresses on larger scales , and that the turbulent - stress boost to explodability may be smaller in 3d",
    ". this could also be a factor in the more anemic outcomes in published 3d models .",
    "nevertheless , it may be that the more problematic nature of published 3d models vis -  - vis 2d models is a consequence of some combination of the use of ray - by - ray+ , the reduced turbulent stress in 3d , and the lack of proper many - body suppression factors in those models .",
    "hence , we suggest that the inclusion of many - body terms , whose effect we study in this paper (  [ horo ] ) , can compensate for the ( likely ) smaller turbulent stress in 3d and the negative , but physical , effect of switching to real multi - d transport . in this sense ,",
    "structure factor corrections could be a missing pieces of physics needed for robust supernova explosions in 3d .",
    "of course , this will need to be tested , but our current results in this regard are quite encouraging .",
    "we now provide the salient results concerning our benchmark models for the 12- , 15- , 20- , and 25-m@xmath1 progenitor models of woosley & heger ( 2007 ) .",
    "we defer a much more extensive discussion on these and other models to a later paper ( vartanyan et al .",
    "these models include gr , the detailed microphysical neutrino - matter interaction suite of burrows , reddy , & thompson ( 2006 ) , the ls220 eos , inelastic scattering on both electrons and nucleons , the many - body axial - vector structure factor correction to neutrino - nucleon scattering of horowitz et al .",

    "the envelope binding energy is significantly smaller below 12 m@xmath1 .",
    "the large hump around @xmath040 m@xmath1 speaks volumes about the capacity of such progenitor models to explode with a neutron star residue .",

    "our 12- and 15-m@xmath1 progenitor models do not explode within one second of bounce .",
    "for all progenitors except the 25-m@xmath1 model , the benchmark diagnostic energies exceed the envelope binding energies by the end of the simulations .",
    "moreover , all explosion energies are still accumulating at the ( arbitrary ) end of our runs .",
    "we note that many of our benchmark 2d models explode asymmetrically ( vartanyan et al .",
    "2017 , in preparation ) . during the first @xmath00.5 seconds into explosion",
    ", one hemisphere continues to experience accretion and contributes little to our estimate of the diagnostic explosion energy .",
    "this could be an artifact of the ring structure in axisymmetric 2d simulations and is not expected in 3d simulations of the same models ( dolence et al .",
    "however , continued accretion maintains higher driving luminosities , so whether we will actually realize this boost in the 3d models is not at all clear .",
    "nevertheless , we speculate that our diagnostic explosion energies in 3d could be as much as a factor of two larger at the same phase of explosive evolution",
    ". we will explore this hypothesis in future work .",
    "it has been suggested ( chugai & utrobin 2014 ) that the explosion energy may be correlated with zams mass , although the measured core - collapse supernova energies have yet to be pinned down . though we have not carried our calculations out to the many seconds after bounce necessary to determine asymptotic explosion energies ( mller 2016 )",
    ", the set of diagnostic and envelope binding energies we witness suggests that total supernova energies may have a peak and are unlikely to be monotonic with zams mass out to the larger masses .",
    "for all exploding models , a secondary shock emerges at late times and catches up to the primary shock ; this is the proto - neutron star wind ( burrows , hayes , & fryxell 1995 ) .",
    "the maximum entropies of the ejecta at the end of our simulations are generally @xmath050@xmath760 . for our benchmark 12 , 15 , 20 , and 25 m@xmath1 progenitor models , the baryon masses of the neutron stars left behind",
    "are 1.50 , 1.70 , 1.92 , and 1.92 m@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "these matters will be further explored in vartanyan et al .",
    "finally , we conclude that the compactness parameter ( oconnor & ott 2011,2013 ) , defined at bounce for a given mass interior ( @xmath52 ) at a given radius ( @xmath53 ) as @xmath54 , although it is one measure of the important density structure of the progenitor , is not necessarily predictive of explosion , at least during the first second after bounce .",
    "we find that , depending upon the neutrino physics employed , the temporal order in which models with different compactness parameters explode after bounce varies . though the compactness parameter is large for the 25-m@xmath1 model and small for the 12-m@xmath1 , we found that the former can be more explodable than the latter when not including the many - body correction .",
    "one might have thought that if compactness were the sole predictor the details of the neutrino - matter interaction would have mattered little in this regard .",
    "however , we see that the time to explosion does not necessarily correlate well with compactness . models with dense envelopes have larger accretion and total neutrino luminosities after bounce , and it is these luminosities that drive explosion . in addition , models with dense envelopes and higher compactness have a greater optical depth to neutrinos in the gain region .",
    "since the neutrino power deposition goes approximately as the product of this depth and the luminosities , high - compactness progenitors have an advantage .",
    "therefore , it is feasible that more massive models might be more explosive , and this trend has been seen by other modelers ( summa et al .",
    "2016 ; bruenn et al .",
    "in fact , in the summa et al . and bruenn et al .",
    "papers for the woosley & heger ( 2007 ) models , the post - bounce explosion times increase in the sequence 20 , 25 , 15 , and 12 m@xmath1 , which is clearly not monotonic with compactness .",
    "moreover , when the many - body term is dropped and seed perturbations are not imposed , our 12-m@xmath1 models do not explode even after 1.0 seconds .",
    "this behavior is the reverse of what might be expected if low compactness signaled greater explodability .",
    "a critical issue is whether these more massive models with shallower density profiles that explode early can maintain explosion during the traversal of the shock through the outer stellar mantle .",
    "the binding energy penalty of the outer envelope generally increases with progenitor mass and might be too steep a price to pay during subsequent evolution for those more massive cores that explode earlier ( when they do , such as our 20-m@xmath1 and 25-m@xmath1 runs ) and more energetically .",
    "as previosuly stated , for most of the relevant mass function , the envelope binding energy exterior to a given interior mass is an increasing function of progenitor mass .",
    "it is this  barrier \" that may set the limit to the range of massive stars that can explode and leave behind neutron stars , although it can not be excluded that the progenitor mass range that yields neutron stars , and not black holes , may be discontinuous ( sukhbold et al . 2016 ) .",
    "figure [ compactness ] depicts the close correspondence between the compactness and the envelope binding energy exterior to a baryonic mass cut of 1.5 m@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we contend that whatever significance there may be to the compactness parameter is likely due to its correspondence with the binding energy of the outer envelope exterior to a given mass cut and that compactness need not correlate with the apparent explodability during the first second after core bounce .",
    "importantly , the ultimate outcome will depend upon the progress of the shock at post - bounce times that generally exceed those to which most core - collapse simulations currently go .",
    "in this paper , we have generated and explored detailed 2d ( axisymmetric ) gr models of core - collapse supernovae using the new code f , treating all the relevant physics to determine the dependence of the mechanism of explosion and its timing on the physical and numerical inputs and assumptions .",
    "these include inelastic neutrino - electron and neutrino - nucleon scattering , many - body / structure - factor corrections to the neutrino - nucleon scattering rates , and physically - motivated initial perturbations .",
    "we have also reexamined in brief the effect of using the ray - by - ray+ simplification to neutrino transport .",
    "we found that much of the wide variation between the results , in particular the time to explosion and explosion energies , obtained by different groups around the world simulating stellar collapse ( as well as whether the core explodes at all ) might be explained by slight variations at the @xmath010 - 30% level in the microphysical inputs when the models are near the critical condition for explosion . in the process",
    ", we gauged the relative importance of otherwise sub - dominant neutrino physics processes to the outcome of collapse . proximity to criticality amplifies the dependence upon small changes in the neutrino sector that translate into slight , but crucial , changes in the emergent luminosities and average neutrino energies and the consequent post - shock heating rates ; such sensitivity is not manifest in 1d simulations for which the core is ( most often ) far from explosive .    thus , ",
    "mazurek s law \" of severe feedback under variations in neutrino cross sections and rates is overturned due to the proximity to instability possible in the realistic multi - d turbulent context .",
    "while alterations in the neutrino coupling rates have little effect in 1d , in multi - d the hydrodynamic response to even small changes and/or corrections to neutrino interaction rates can be more substantial due to greater proximity to the critical curve .",
    "this is one of the theses and motivating factors of this work .",
    "the upshot is that small variations between the methods , microphysics , and resolutions used by groups who ostensibly are incorporating the  same \" inputs translates naturally into post - bounce explosion time differences that can range by many hundreds of milliseconds , and in some cases can turn a dud into an explosion ( or vice versa ) .",
    "we suggest that this thereby explains in large measure the apparent heterogeneity in the outcomes of detailed simulations performed internationally .",
    "a natural conclusion is that , viewed correctly , the different groups are collectively closer to a realistic understanding of the neutrino - driven mechanism of supernova explosion than might have seemed apparent and that a push to rationalize approaches and understand microphysical details in the neutrino - matter interaction sector and the nuclear equation of state could bring a resolution to the decades - long quest for a predictive model of core - collapse supernova explosions .",
    "importantly , we have found that many - body corrections to neutrino - matter scattering rates , even at sub - nuclear densities , can have as large an effect as , or even a larger effect than , general relativity , progenitor perturbations , or inelastic neutrino - electron and neutrino - nucleon scattering .",
    "the enhancement effects brought on by the inclusion of the many - body suppression of neutrino - matter scattering rates may be one of the crucial missing pieces of the supernova puzzle .",
    "however , we caution that the actual magnitude and functional form of all the various many - body corrections to the neutrino - matter rates ( both neutral- and charged - current ) , however important they seem from our current simulations , still need to be explored and verified .",
    "we performed a test using the ray - by - ray+ approximation to neutrino transport in a manner similar to that employed by skinner et al .",
    "( 2016 ) to gauge its effect on the outcome of collapse when a full physics suite is employed . in skinner et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , it was shown that ray - by - ray+ artificially enhanced heating along the poles in synchrony with the axial sloshing seen in 2d simulations and thereby made models more explosive . here , we focused on the 20-m@xmath1 progenitor of woosley & heger ( 2007 ) and found that if the model had exploded very late without this approach ( using more realistic and truly multi - d transport ) that it exploded significantly earlier when the ray - by - ray+ method was employed . this temporal shift can be as large as the full range in explosion times currently witnessed by the various supernova simulation groups for a given progenitor .",
    "one can speculate that had groups that use the ray - by - ray+ simplification used real multi - d transport their 2d models would have exploded later , perhaps much later or not at all .",
    "speculating further , one wonders whether , since non - rotating 3d simulations seldom manifest the axial sloshing seen in 2d and may , as a result , be less susceptible to the ray - by - ray+ anomaly , that the fact that 3d models explode later than the corresponding 2d models ( lentz et al .",
    "2015 ) or not at all ( melson et al .",
    "2015 , if without their strangeness fix ) may be connected with their use of ray - by - ray+ . in short , without ray - by - ray+ , it is not clear that 2d would explode much earlier than 3d .",
    "however , the differences between the 2d and 3d convective cascades may be equally in play here and the associated simulations still need to be performed to assess this .",
    "nevertheless , we suggest that adding many - body corrections to neutrino - nucleon scattering , which is a real physical effect ( even though its magnitude has yet to be definitely pinned down ) , might in part or wholely compensate for upgrading ray - by - ray+ to full multi - d transport in 3d simulations .",
    "the possible role of initial perturbations as seeds to the growth of convective instability in and around the gain region has been a subject of recent focus .",
    "clearly , allowing grid noise , truncation error , or other numerical noise to initiate linear growth to the non - linear phase , or imposing artificial initial perturbations , is less than satisfactory .",
    "this is particularly true given that seeds have a finite time to grow after accreting through the shock before leaving the unstable region and given that the time to instability and explosion is germane to which phase of the neutrino light curve is driving explosion . inaugurating the non - linear convective phase early and maintaining it until explosion may be important , and the magnitude and timing of convective seeding is therefore of interest .",
    "though we have deferred until later a more comprehensive study of this subject , we tested the effect of adding to the progenitor velocity perturbations whose magnitude was informed by mixing - length theory ( mller et al .",
    "in fact , we allowed the maximum perturbation speed to be 1000 km s@xmath47 , with a mach number as high as @xmath00.12 , which is a bit larger than found in 1d progenitor models ( cf . woosley & heger 2007 ) .",
    "indeed , we found that large imposed perturbations of this sort accelerated the time to explosion for an otherwise late explosion . in summary",
    ", we did not find such imposed perturbations critical to explosion , but found that they can aide an otherwise marginal one .",
    "nevertheless , it will be important to determine their character , and the many 3d - progenitor studies now in process promise to do just that .",
    "many - body corrections to scattering rates , inelastic scattering , and initial seed perturbations all boost  explodability , \" increase explosion energy , and shorten the time to explosion .",
    "in fact , these effects add synergistically and non - linearly to aide explosion , despite the fact that they individually amount to effects at the @xmath010@xmath730% level .",
    "this is due to the proximity of multi - d models to criticality , and is not seen in 1d simulations .",
    "furthermore , the turbulence behind the shock that has been shown to aid explosion in the realistic multi - d context naturally introduces indeterminacy in detail . even the same progenitor star , but with different random seed perturbations and rotational structures at collapse , should yield a range of explosion energies , nucleosynthesis , @xmath55ni yields , pulsar kicks , and explosion morphologies .",
    "therefore , it is expected that nature provides distribution functions , and not one - to - one maps , in all signatures of explosion . in the long run , theory will need to come to grips with this , but in the short run one should not expect that in the chaotic context of turbulent convection and pre - collapse structures the best models will correspond in detail .",
    "this is the physical and natural consequence of chaos , and will be paralleled in comparison verification studies .",
    "we now find that all our multi - d models with realistic physics explode by the neutrino heating mechanism .",
    "proximity to criticality amplifies the role of even small neutrino - matter effects .",
    "in particular , the effect of the many - body structure - factor correction to neutrino - nucleon scattering on the driving @xmath9 and @xmath17 luminosities and average energies boosts explodability , as does inelastic scattering off electrons and nucleons .",
    "this might offset the negative effect on the results for those using the problematic ray - by - ray+ approach of converting to fully multi - d transport , although this has yet to be determined in 3d .",
    "imposing perturbations of significance is also modestly supportive of explosion , but does not seem necessary .    the next stage is to explore the same issues in three dimensions , and it is only after performing such simulations , and their subsequent verification , that a robust resolution to the core - collapse supernova problem can be claimed .",
    "nevertheless , there has been significant progress of late in unraveling this central mystery in astrophysics , in demonstrating the viability of the neutrino - driven mechanism of explosion , and in illuminating its component physics .",
    "it was with these ultimate goals in mind that this paper was forged .",
