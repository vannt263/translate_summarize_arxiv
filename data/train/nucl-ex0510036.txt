    "it is often presumed that particle correlations are only `` short - range '' in rapidity .",
    "short range correlations have been observed at all energies @xcite , in two - particle correlation measurements .",
    "however , they have never been shown to be the only source of correlation in multiparticle production .",
    "indeed , single - particle distributions of inclusive charged particles produced in heavy ion collisions reveal a distinct `` trapezoidal '' structure stretching across the full rapidity range available in these reactions .",
    "more importantly , there is no evidence of an extended boost invariance , which would imply independent emission from different rapidity regions .",
    "rather , two non - trivial effects are visible in the centrality dependence of particle production , which are apparently long - range in rapidity .",
    "integrating over the full phase space reveals that particle production is linear with the number of participants  @xcite .",
    "this occurs despite a significant change in the shape of the pseudorapidity dependence as a function of centrality , which happens to be collision - energy independent in the forward region  @xcite .",
    "all of this suggests that charged - particle production at mid - rapidity is highly correlated with particle production in the forward region , which naturally begs the question of the underlying structure of the single - particle distributions . in these proceedings , we discuss how to take first steps in this direction via the study of forward - backward multiplicity correlations .",
    "in this work , particle correlations are studied by the event - by - event comparison of the integrated multiplicity in a bin defined in the forward ( @xmath5 ) region , called @xmath6 , centered at @xmath1 with width @xmath4 , with the multiplicity measured in an identical bin defined in the backward hemisphere ( called `` @xmath7 '' ) . with these definitions",
    ", one can construct the event - wise observable @xmath8 , and measure its variance @xmath9 for a set of events with nominally similar characteristics ( e.g. centrality ) .",
    "if particle sources tend to emit into the forward _ or _ backward region , such that the partitioning is binomial , this leads to @xmath10 , since @xmath11 .",
    "short - range correlations arise if the objects emitted into either hemisphere tend to break into @xmath12 particles , each of which stay close in rapidity ( e.g. due to isotropic emission ) . if each cluster decays into exactly @xmath12 particles , then @xmath13 , so @xmath14 .",
    "such intrinsic short - range correlations have in fact been measured in @xmath15 and @xmath16 experiments by direct construction of the 2-particle correlation function in @xmath1  @xcite . by varying @xmath4 and measuring the ratio @xmath17 as a function of @xmath18",
    ", they found an `` effective '' cluster multiplicity ( @xmath19 ) of approximately 2 charged particles , which exceeds the value of 1.5 estimated for a resonance gas  @xcite .",
    "the data analyzed here were taken with the phobos detector  @xcite during runs 2 and 4 , in 2001 and 2004 , respectively .",
    "the pseudorapidity acceptance was restricted to that of the `` octagon '' detector , which is a tube of silicon sensors covering @xmath0 and full azimuth except for a region near midrapidity . to simplify the analysis for different values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , only the regions of the detector with complete rapidity coverage were kept , restricting the total azimuthal acceptance to @xmath20 , in four 45-degree wedges  @xcite .",
    "the multiplicity in each bin is estimated event - by - event by summing up the angle - corrected deposited energy of all hits and then dividing by the average energy per particle  @xcite . beyond the usual lower threshold to define a hit in the silicon , an @xmath1-dependent upper bound of the deposited energy per hit is applied to reduce the effect of slow secondaries on the fluctuations .",
    "the average @xmath21 , calculated as a function of @xmath1 , centrality , and event vertex , is subtracted event - by - event to correct for gaps in the octagon ( a process which , according to simulations , leaves the fluctuations unaffected ) .    to provide information that can be directly applied to models , a procedure was developed to estimate and remove the detector effects from the raw measured value of @xmath3 ( @xmath22 ) by using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the phobos apparatus .",
    "the basic idea is to assume that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the contribution from detector effects , and use the mc to subtract it on average , leaving behind only the physical correlations .",
    "however , it is found that there are several sources which contribute differently as a function of @xmath1 and combine in quadrature to a nearly - constant value over the pseudorapidity range covered by the octagon  @xcite .",
    "these are corrected on average by calculating @xmath3 using a modified hijing simulation with all intrinsic correlations destroyed , which allows a direct estimation of @xmath24 .",
    "there remains a subdominant correlation of @xmath24 with @xmath3 which is also removed .",
    "finally , we correct for using only half - azimuth acceptance by @xmath25 , a formula obtained using mc simulations , assuming that the limited acceptance only affects the clustering properties of particle production .",
    "systematic uncertainties were calculated by varying several assumptions about the estimation of @xmath3 and found to be around @xmath26 .",
    "the bin - to - bin variation of the systematic error calculation was averaged over @xmath1 to reduce fluctuations in the error determination procedure .",
    "after correcting for detector effects , the results on @xmath3 can be directly compared with model calculations based on charged primary particles .",
    "we have focused mainly on hijing  @xcite and ampt  @xcite , which have been used to describe various features of heavy ion collisions at rhic energies .",
    "the first set of results concern the @xmath1 dependence , for forward and backward bins that are @xmath27 units wide , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : etadeta ] . in this case , hijing and ampt already show some interesting differences .",
    "for peripheral ( 40 - 60% ) events , both models have a similar magnitude and a monotonically - rising @xmath1 dependence .",
    "central events show a substantial difference extending over most of the rapidity range , with ampt showing a systematically smaller value of @xmath3 .",
    "this may be due to initially produced clusters being destroyed by the hadronic rescattering stage .",
    "also , it is observed that both data and mc show @xmath28 at @xmath29 . although this is suggestive of the effect predicted by jeon et al @xcite , it can also be explained if clusters produced at @xmath30 emit particles into _ both _ the @xmath6 and @xmath7 side , inducing an `` intrinsic '' long - range correlation that decreases @xmath3 .     for a fixed @xmath27 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "( lower ) @xmath3 as a function of @xmath2 for a fixed bin center at @xmath31 .",
    "[ fig : etadeta],title=\"fig:\",width=529 ]   for a fixed @xmath27 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "( lower ) @xmath3 as a function of @xmath2 for a fixed bin center at @xmath31 .",
    "[ fig : etadeta],title=\"fig:\",width=529 ]    the next set of results is the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath3 , with a fixed @xmath32 , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : etadeta ] .",
    "one sees that for both peripheral and central data , @xmath3 rises monotonically with increasing pseudorapidity interval .",
    "this can be explained in the context of cluster emission : by increasing @xmath2 , one increases the probability of observing more than one particle emitted from a single cluster in either @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "clearly , the rate of change with @xmath2 should reflect the full cluster distribution ( both @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) , but these studies have not yet been done .",
    "it is striking that the peripheral data has already reached @xmath35 for the largest @xmath2 in peripheral events , while this number is closer to 2 for central data .",
    "finally , it is interesting that neither hijing nor ampt can explain both the centrality and @xmath4 dependence simultaneously , as hijing reproduces the central data but has no centrality dependence , while ampt is lower than the central data , but also sees a decrease in the overall magnitude moving from peripheral to central events .",
    "in conclusion , measurements of forward - backward fluctuations provide insight into the structure of long and short range correlations in pseudorapidity space . the new phobos data for 200 gev au+au collisions are now fully corrected for detector and background effects , so direct comparisons can be made to phenomenological models .",
    "we see significant short - range correlations at all centralities and pseudorapidities , instead of just at mid - rapidity .",
    "there is a non - trivial centrality and rapidity dependence of these correlations , in both @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "finally , neither hijing nor ampt reproduces even the qualitative features , but the way in which they fail to do so may well provide information on the underlying physics . in particular , more theoretical attention should be paid to the properties of `` clusters '' required to explain our data .",
    "jeon et al have proposed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the formation of a qgp near mid - rapidity should destroy any sort of cluster structure seen in p+p , and thus lead to a reduction in @xmath3 , beyond the detector - related effects discussed here .",
    "the data shown here should provide means to study such effects , or set upper limits on their occurrence .",
