    "it is the big advantage of epstein and glaser s causal approach to quantum field theory [ 1 ] that it explicitly uses the causal structure of the theory , which is invisible in the traditional lagrangian approach using feynman rules or in path - integral methods . as a consequence ,",
    "it is possible to prove the general properties of the s - matrix in very direct and transparent manner [ 2 ] .",
    "however , the full strength of the causal method comes out in higher order calculations and can be summarized in the following points :    1 . )",
    "there exists no ultraviolet problem in the causal theory , so that no regularization is necessary .    2 .",
    ") all integrals are four - dimensional , so that no @xmath0-problem exists .",
    "furthermore , the number of non - trivial integrations is reduced to the minimum , essentially one one - dimensional integral for every additional loop .    3 .",
    ") the method is inductive in the order @xmath1 of perturbation theory , so that the work done in lower orders is completely and automatically utilized in higher orders .",
    "the main reason why the feynman rules are not optimal for loop diagrams is the following .",
    "suppose that time ordering can simply be done by multiplication with step functions @xmath2 , as in the scalar theory we are going to consider .",
    "then , in calculating a time - ordered product according to the rules , * every * pairing of field operators gets such a @xmath3-function which leads to the feynman propagators @xmath4 .",
    "however , the time ordering of the vertices is already specified by less @xmath3-functions . without the temporal @xmath3-function",
    "the pairing function is @xmath5 instead of @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , some propagators @xmath6 can actually be simplified into @xmath7 which is simpler to integrate because it contains a @xmath8-distribution in p - space .",
    "for example , in the causal theory the third order scalar vertex function is given by @xmath9 if one substitutes @xmath10 in the first term , one arrives at the usual feynman form @xmath11 because the last two terms are equal to @xmath12 which vanishes by the support properties of the advanced and retarded distributions .",
    "but ( 1.1 ) is simpler to calculate than ( 1.2 ) because every member contains one @xmath13 .",
    "this advantage is strongly increasing in higher loop diagrams .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to illustrate these features for the so - called two - loop master diagram of fig.1 .",
    "interestingly enough , this diagram was already computed with the causal method by various authors without knowing it .",
    "the first were klln and sabry [ 3 ] , their work was extended by broadhurst [ 4 ] to other mass cases .",
    "the most extensive higher order calculations using the `` dispersive method '' were carried out over many years by the italian group mignaco , remiddi [ 5 ] , barbieri [ 6 ] and others ( see [ 7 ] and references given therein ) .",
    "all these authors base their calculations on analytic properties of feynman integrals which are often referred to as cutcosky rules .",
    "the lack of understanding of these analytic properties has created the problem of anomalous thresholds .",
    "fortunately , the latter do not appear in diagrams with two and three external legs , but they do appear in four- and more legs - diagrams [ 8 ] .",
    "such basic subjects are discussed in the following section . as a first application ,",
    "we then briefly describe the calculation of the scalar vertex function with arbitrary masses which is needed at various places in the later two - loop calculations .",
    "in sect.3 we turn to the master diagram for vacuum polarization .",
    "we show the calculation of the causal distribution in some detail to localize the infrared divergences which appear in the case of vanishing photon mass .",
    "the most difficult integration is the dispersion integral for the splitting .",
    "the necessary techniques to handle polylogarithms are shown in sect.4 .",
    "finally we consider the more complicated case of the fermion propagator . by ingenious tricks ,",
    "broadhurst [ 4 ] succeeded in expressing this propagator by a one - dimensional integral over the complete elliptic integral of the first kind @xmath14 together with elementary functions which can easily be computed numerically . in the causal theory one needs not be a genius .",
    "we get the result by a slight change of the standard procedure .",
    "as far as the spin structure is concerned , it is known that the general two - legs diagram can be expressed in terms of the scalar two - point functions [ 9 ] .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to the scalar case here .",
    "we first summarize the main ingredients of the causal method , for details we refer to [ 1,2 ] . in the causal theory",
    "the s - matrix is viewed as an operator - valued distribution of the following form @xmath15 where @xmath16 , the schwartz space of functions of rapid decrease . the test function @xmath17 plays the role of `` adiabatic switching '' and provides a cutoff in the long - range part of the interaction , without destroying any symmetry .",
    "it can be considered as a natural infrared regulator .",
    "the adiabatic limit @xmath18 must be performed at the end of the calculation in the right quantities where this limit exists .",
    "the existence of the adiabatic limit becomes a problem if the theory contains massless fields .",
    "the @xmath1-point operator - valued distributions @xmath19 are the basic objects of the theory . they can be constructed inductively from @xmath20 through a number of physical requirements , the most essential one being causality .",
    "unitarity plays no essential role .",
    "let the operator - valued distributions @xmath21 be defined by @xmath22 then one defines , for arbitrary sets of points @xmath23 , @xmath24 in minkowski space , the following distributions @xmath25 @xmath26 where the sums run over all partitions @xmath27 into disjoint subsets with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 means the number of points in the set @xmath23 .",
    "we also introduce @xmath31 if the sums are extended over all partitions @xmath32 , including the empty set @xmath33 , we obtain the distributions",
    "@xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 these two distributions are not known by the induction assumption because they contain the unknown @xmath19 .",
    "only the difference @xmath38 is known .",
    "one can determine @xmath39 or @xmath40 separately by investigating the support properties of the various distributions , this is the point where the causal structure becomes important .",
    "it turns out that @xmath39 is a retarded and @xmath40 an advanced distribution @xmath41 with @xmath42 @xmath43 hence , by splitting of the causal distribution ( 2.8 ) one gets @xmath39 ( and @xmath40 ) , and @xmath19 then follows from ( 2.7 ) ( or ( 2.6 ) ) .",
    "the @xmath19 s are well - defined time - ordered products . to carry out the splitting process",
    ", we write ( 2.8 ) in normally ordered form and then split the numerical distributions @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "the causal splitting of @xmath46 can directly be done in momentum space by means of the following dispersion formula @xmath47 which holds true for @xmath48 ( upper signs ) or @xmath49 ( lower signs ) .",
    "the result for arbitrary @xmath50 is obtained by analytic continuation , based on the fact that the retarded distribution @xmath51 is the boundary value of an analytic function , regular in @xmath52 .",
    "this so - called central splitting solution is very convenient because it is obviously lorentz covariant and does not destroy any symmetry of the theory .",
    "@xmath53 is the singular order of @xmath54 [ 2 ] , in case of trivial splitting one has @xmath55 .",
    "the formulae ( 2.3 - 4 ) contain what is usually called cutkosky rules .",
    "but we would like to emphasize that the sums run over _ all _ non - trivial partitions @xmath56 .",
    "if @xmath23 and @xmath24 are connected the term corresponds to an ordinary cut through the diagram .",
    "otherwise the diagram is decomposed into more than two pieces .",
    "in this situation anomalous thresholds appear .",
    "but this only occurs in diagrams with more than three external legs .    to calculate scalar diagrams with arbitrary masses , we start the inductive process from the following first order @xmath57 here @xmath58 , @xmath59 are charged scalar fields with masses @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , and @xmath62 is a neutral ( self - adjoint ) scalar field of mass @xmath63 .",
    "all fields are free fields satisfying the following commutation relations @xmath64=-id_{m_j}(x - y),\\quad j=1,2\\eqno(2.15)\\ ] ] @xmath65=-id_{m_j}^{+}(x - y),\\eqno(2.16)\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the jordan - pauli distribution of mass @xmath67 and @xmath68 refers to the positive and negative frequency parts of the various quantities .",
    "@xmath62 fulfills the same commutation relations without the hermitian adjoint @xmath69 .",
    "the commutator ( 2.16 ) gives the contraction in wick s theorem , its fourier transform is equal to @xmath70 the last vertex @xmath71 plays a special role in the above equations ( 2.3 - 10 ) .",
    "it is the splitting vertex , defining the edge of the causal cone . by translation invariance",
    "the numerical distributions only depend on the relative coordinates @xmath72 the fourier transform is always understood with respect to these relative coordinates @xmath73    until now all @xmath1-th order distributions depend on @xmath1 or @xmath74 variables , the inner vertices are not integrated out . if the adiabatic limit exists , we can integrate the inner coordinates with @xmath75 . in @xmath50-space",
    "this means that the inner momenta are put equal to 0 .",
    "then many terms in ( 2.3 - 4 ) vanish :    * lemma 1 . * in the adiabatic limit only those partitions @xmath56 contribute to @xmath76 ( 2.3 ) where @xmath23 and @xmath77 contain external vertices , and similarly for @xmath78 ( 2.4 ) .",
    "* proof . * consider a partition where @xmath23 contains no external vertex . performing the contractions between @xmath23 and @xmath77 with @xmath5-distributions and transforming into @xmath50-space ( 2.17 ) , we get a product of @xmath3-functions",
    "@xmath79 where all momenta add up to 0 : @xmath80 such a product is zero .    the exists one serious problem , however . the central splitting solution ( 2.13 )",
    "is only true if all momenta @xmath81 are * inside * the light cone .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , we can not put the inner momenta equal to 0 .",
    "but if the @xmath82-distribution is massive @xmath83 , the vanishing of the contribution of a wrong partition takes place for small enough inner momenta @xmath84 in @xmath85,already .",
    "then we can use ( 2.13 ) and take the limit @xmath86 .",
    "for this reason we always calculate with massive fields first .",
    "if the limit @xmath87 is required , it must be carefully performed by taking cancellations of infrared divergences between different terms into account .",
    "from lemma 1 it is clear that in diagrams with two and three external legs , the non - vanishing terms ( in the adiabatic limit ) correspond to ordinary cuts through the diagram .",
    "but in a four - legs diagram a pair of opposite legs can be in @xmath23 and the other pair of opposite legs in @xmath77 .",
    "then this decomposition is no longer a simple cut and an `` anomalous threshold '' appears . to our knowledge",
    "such a diagram was never computed by the naive `` dispersive method '' , but in the causal theory this is no problem .",
    "the following second lemma further simplifies the later calculations .",
    "it is a consequence of parity- and time - reversal invariance .    * lemma 2 . * in a pt - invariant theory the numerical distributions @xmath44 in @xmath88 ( 2.5 ) are essentially real ( i.e. up to an overall factor @xmath89 ) in momentum space : @xmath90 .    *",
    "proof . * we know that the causal @xmath91-distributions are pt - invariant ( [ 2 ] , p.281 ) .",
    "this implies for the numerical distributions : @xmath92 .",
    "the complex conjugate comes from the antiunitarity of time - reversal .",
    "after fourier transformation this gives the desired result in momentum space .",
    "the overall factor @xmath89 depends on whether the number of internal lines in the diagram is even or odd .",
    "we now come to the calculation of the third order vertex diagram ( fig.2 ) . to simplify the notation",
    ", we write the arguments in @xmath93-space without the dummy variable @xmath93 . from",
    "( 2.4 ) we have @xmath94 the first term herein contains a compton subgraph @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the feynman propagator .",
    "the product ( 2.21 ) is computed by wicks theorem , restricting ourselves to those contractions which generate the vertex diagram : @xmath97 similarly we get for the other two terms in ( 2.20 ) @xmath98 @xmath99 the anti - feynman propagator @xmath100 is the complex conjugate of @xmath101 .",
    "it appears because we have used unitarity @xmath102 .",
    "this is the only minor role which unitarity plays here .",
    "the result for @xmath103 ( 2.3 ) is obtained in the same way .",
    "collecting the terms with field operators @xmath104 in @xmath105 ( 2.5 ) , the corresponding numerical distribution is given by @xmath106 @xmath107 where we have used @xmath108 and the arguments in the 6 terms agree with the first term .",
    "the 6 terms come from three cuts through the vertex diagram , not only one .",
    "to get contact with the convention in [ 2 ] , we shall use the relative coordinates @xmath109 and calculate the fourier transform @xmath110 then we arrive at @xmath111 @xmath112-[p\\lra q,\\>m_1\\lra m_2].\\eqno(2.29)\\ ] ] up to the arbitrary masses and the imaginary parts , this agrees precisely with the result in qed ( [ 2 ] , eq.(3.8.28 ) ) . by the same techniques as in the qed case",
    ", we then find @xmath113 @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 @xmath117 @xmath118",
    "because of lemma 2 we only need the real parts of the logarithms .",
    "the splitting of ( 2.30 ) by means of the central solution ( 2.13 ) is done later in ( 3.10 ) .",
    "now we envisage the calculation of the diagram shown in fig.1a , which contributes to vacuum polarization in fourth order .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case with vanishing photon mass @xmath63 and mass @xmath67 of the electron. from ( 2.4 ) we have @xmath119 @xmath120 note that we only consider terms with field operator @xmath121 . according to lemma 1 , the first , the third and the fifth term in ( 3.1 ) vanish in the adiabatic limit .",
    "furthermore , the second term @xmath122 gives the same contribution as @xmath123 , and the same holds true for @xmath124 and @xmath125 .    in x - space , the three - particle contribution @xmath124 ( fig .",
    "3a ) is given by @xmath126 @xmath127 the fourier transform of ( 3.3 ) is @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 which becomes in the adiabatic limit @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134    in fact , the calculation of ( 3.5 ) has already been performed in [ 2 ] by g.klln and a.sabry .",
    "our calculations confirm their result exactly , namely : @xmath135 @xmath136 up to terms that vanish for @xmath137 . here",
    "we have introduced the well - known dilogarithm @xmath138 , and the variable @xmath139 which varies from @xmath140 to @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "the two - particle contribution @xmath143 ( fig.3b ) is @xmath144 here , @xmath145 is the vertex function .",
    "since its first argument lies in the backward light - cone and the second one in the forward light - cone , we are in the case of lower signs in ( 2.13 ) , because of our convention ( 2.27 )",
    ". then the retarded vertex function @xmath146 is given by the following dispersion integral : @xmath147 again , the computation of ( the real part of ) @xmath143 can be carried out in a straightforward manner . as we know from ( 2.30 ) , the vertex function consists of three different parts .",
    "the first one leads to an infrared finite contribution to @xmath143 : @xmath148 @xmath149 whereas the second and third term are equal and contain an infrared divergent term @xmath150 , which cancels the infrared divergence in ( 3.7 ) :    @xmath151 @xmath152    now @xmath153 can immediately be written down if we note that @xmath154",
    "after having calculated the causal distribution @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 we must decompose it into retarded and advanced parts .",
    "the retarded distribution @xmath159 is given in the forward light - cone according to ( 2.13 ) @xmath160 @xmath161 it is very convenient to introduce the new integration variable @xmath162 this leads to ( @xmath163 ) @xmath164 the imaginary part @xmath165 in the denominator of ( 4.2 ) is included in @xmath166 as discussed at the end of this section .    from now on ,",

    "the integral @xmath173 is just a constant and can be calculated with the formulae given in [ 10,11 ] .",
    "the calculation of @xmath174 is most easily performed by first calculating the derivatives of @xmath175 and @xmath176 : @xmath177 @xmath178 this is a helpful trick , but all integrals coming up in ( 4.6 ) are also discussed in the literature mentioned above .",
    "we give the separate results for the two - particle and three - particle expressions : @xmath179 @xmath180 @xmath181 and @xmath182 @xmath183 @xmath184 where @xmath185 . here",
    "we have introduced the trilogarithm , which is defined by @xmath186 the infrared divergent terms in @xmath187 and @xmath188 which cancel mutually in @xmath159 have already been omitted . finally @xmath159 is given by @xmath189 3_3 @xmath190 @xmath191 if @xmath192 becomes complex the sign of the imaginary parts is determined by the @xmath165 in ( 4.2 ) as follows .",
    "for arbitrary time - like @xmath50 , the @xmath165 goes over into @xmath193 ( see ( 2.13 ) and [ 2 ] , chap.3.6 ) . to obtain the full time - ordered distribution @xmath194 we have to subtract @xmath195 .",
    "this changes @xmath193 into @xmath165 again .",
    "consequently , @xmath194 is given by ( 4.13 ) with @xmath166 substituted by @xmath196 , i.e. @xmath197 .",
    "this fixes the signs of the imaginary parts at the logarithmic cuts in ( 4.14 ) . for space - like @xmath50",
    ", @xmath194 is simply given by ( 4.13 ) because @xmath195 now vanishes and @xmath192 is real .",
    "after having demonstrated the instructive example of vacuum polarization , we proceed now with the discussion of the electron propagator in fourth order ( fig.1b ) . again",
    ", we start from the general expression ( 3.1 ) and consider only terms with field operator @xmath198 . just as in the case of vacuum polarization ,",
    "the first , the third and the fifth term in ( 3.1 ) vanish in the adiabatic limit , and the second and the seventh term @xmath199 give the same contribution to the propagator .",
    "but we have to distinguish the different cuts in @xmath124 and @xmath125 .    in x - space , the three - particle contribution in @xmath125 with two photons and one electron as intermediate state ( fig.4 ) is given by @xmath200 @xmath201 the fourier transform is after the adiabatic limit @xmath202 @xmath203 straightforward calculation of ( 5.4 ) leads to the simple result @xmath204 @xmath205 the two - particle contribution can be evaluated without any problem with the aid of ( 2.30 ) .",
    "we therefore quote only the result : @xmath206 @xmath207 @xmath208 in ( 5.6 ) and ( 5.9 ) only the real parts of the dilogarithms contribute .",
    "since we have to treat the three - particle contribution with three electrons as intermediate state ( @xmath209 and @xmath210 ) separately , we already give the splitting results for the expressions obtained so far .",
    "the splitting procedure leads to the same type of integrals as in the case of vacuum polarization in sect.4 , hence we refer again to [ 10,11 ] .",
