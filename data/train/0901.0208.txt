    "we explore what information is contained in the topology of @xmath6 .",
    "to this end , we define :    [ d : indexn ] the _ homotopy index _ of a complex @xmath9 is defined to be 0 if @xmath10 , and the smallest @xmath1 such that @xmath11 is non - trivial , otherwise .",
    "we say a surface @xmath0 is _ topologically minimal _ if its disk complex @xmath6 is either empty or non - contractible . when @xmath0 is topologically minimal , we say its _ topological index _ is the homotopy index of @xmath6 .    for example , a surface @xmath0 has topological index 1 if and only if @xmath12 is non - trivial , i.e. its disk complex is disconnected .",
    "when @xmath0 is the boundary of a handlebody then the disk complex was first defined by mccullough in @xcite , who showed that in this case @xmath6 is contractible .",
    "it follows that such surfaces are not topologically minimal .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to show that topologically minimal surfaces are a natural generalization of several well - known classes of surfaces in 3-manifolds , and that the results that hold for each of these classes also hold true for all topologically minimal surfaces . as an added benefit , proofs involving the set of all topologically minimal surfaces",
    "are often much shorter than existing proofs involving just , say , index 2 surfaces .",
    "this is largely owing to the inductive nature of the arguments .    by definition ,",
    "incompressible surfaces have topological index 0 . in the next section",
    "we show that the _ strongly irreducible _ surfaces of casson and gordon @xcite are precisely those that have topological index 1 .",
    "we also show that _ critical surfaces _",
    ", previously defined by the author in @xcite and @xcite , have topological index 2 .",
    "one important property shared by these types of surfaces is that they may always be isotoped to meet an incompressible surface in a collection of loops that are essential on both .",
    "we show here that this is in fact a corollary of a powerful result about all topologically minimal surfaces .",
    "this is given by theorem [ c : maincorollary ] , which asserts that a topologically minimal surface @xmath0 and an incompressible surface @xmath2 can be isotoped so that @xmath3 is topologically minimal in @xmath13 .",

    "( in the final section we conjecture that this last possibility can not happen . ) finally , we show that if the disjoint union of surfaces is topologically minimal then so are its components , and its topological index is the sum of the indices of its components . combining this with theorem [ c : maincorollary ] , we find that a surface @xmath0 with topological index @xmath1 can be isotoped to meet an incompressible surface @xmath2 in such a way so that the sum of the indices of the components of @xmath3 is at most @xmath1 .",
    "this is a generalization of known results about topological index 0 and 1 surfaces .    in any new theory , the questions raised are as important as the new results . in the final section of this paper we list a few tantalizing questions and conjectures about topologically minimal surfaces .",
    "these include conjectures about the possible indices of topologically minimal surfaces in various kinds of 3-manifolds , a natural generalization of hempel s _ distance _ invariant @xcite to surfaces of arbitrary topological index , and conjectures which relate geometric minimal surfaces to topologically minimal surfaces .",
    "much of the motivation for this work comes from ideas of hyam rubinstein . in",
    "the late 1990 s rubinstein pioneered the viewpoint that strongly irreducible heegaard splittings were the right class of surfaces within which to search for unstable ( geometrically ) minimal surfaces of index 1 , as well as their pl analogues , the so - called  almost normal \" surfaces .",
    "one often finds such surfaces by minimax arguments involving 1-parameter sweepouts .",
    "many of the topological arguments involving strongly irreducible surfaces also use 1-parameter sweepouts , so it became natural to think about such surfaces as being  topologically minimal , \" in a very imprecise sense . in later work",
    "the author defined critical surfaces as an attempt to find some topological analogue to geometrically minimal surfaces that have index 2 .",
    "as one would expect from such an analogue , arguments involving critical surfaces often involve 2-parameter sweepouts .",
    "in this paper we make precise the idea of topological index , demonstrate its usefulness , and conjecture its relation to geometric minimal surfaces .",
    "the present work is the first in a sequence of papers on this topic . in @xcite",
    "we define a relative version of topological index for surfaces with non - empty boundary .",
    "the main result of that paper is that complicated amalgamating surfaces act as barriers to low index , low genus , topologically minimal surfaces .",
    "this is the key technical tool necessary for the author s construction of a counter - example to the _ stabilization conjecture _ for heegaard splittings @xcite .",

    ", we produce examples of 3-manifolds containing surfaces with high topological index @xcite .",

    "general helpful comments were made by martin scharlemann and yoav moriah . finally , it was saul schleimer and eric sedgiwck who first brought the index 1 case of theorem [ c : componentsintersection ] to the attention of the author , which was the beginings of the paper @xcite .",
