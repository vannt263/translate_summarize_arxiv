    "solutions to hyperbolic pdes demonstrate a wide spectrum of regularity behavior . the appearance of singularities in nonlinear cases is known as the blow up of a solution  @xcite .",
    "singularities can appear in a finite time even for small and smooth initial data  @xcite . in some cases , both linear and nonlinear , a solution with time either preserves the same regularity as it has on the boundary or becomes less or more regular in time .",
    "the singularities encountered in the latter case are called anomalous  @xcite .",
    "criteria for the appearance of anomalous singularities are given in  @xcite .",
    "these papers are devoted to the case of interaction between singularities weaker than the dirac measure .",
    "the singularities resulting from this interaction turn out to be weaker than the incoming singularities .",
    "a different effect is observed in  @xcite , where the incoming singularities are derivatives of the dirac measure . in this case",
    "the interaction produces singularities stronger than the initial ones .",
    "we will focus on the phenomenon of improving regularity in the case of initial - boundary value problems with nonlinear local and nonlocal boundary conditions for first - order linear strictly hyperbolic systems .    specifically , in the domain @xmath1 we address the problem @xmath2    @xmath3    where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are real @xmath7-vectors , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 note that boundary conditions  ( [ eq:3 ] ) cover the cases of classical boundary conditions ( if @xmath11 do not depend on @xmath12 ) and reflection boundary conditions of local and nonlocal type .",
    "we assume that @xmath13 for all @xmath14 .",
    "condition ( [ eq : l1 ] ) occurs in many applications , where the functions @xmath15 for @xmath16 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) describe the `` species '' that travel to the left ( resp . to the right ) and are reflected in @xmath18 ( resp .",
    "@xmath19 ) according to the boundary conditions ( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "we will impose the following smoothness assumptions on the initial data : the entries of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath5 , and @xmath22 are smooth in all their arguments in the respective domains , while the entries of @xmath23 are allowed to be either continuous functions or strongly singular distributions .    in the case of a continuous @xmath23 ( considered in section  2 ) , by a solution to problem ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) we mean a _ continuous solution _ , i.e. , a continuous vector - function in @xmath24 satisfying an integral system equivalent to ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of a continuous solution is proved in  @xcite ( see theorem  [ thm : ijdsde ] ) . in the case of a strongly singular @xmath23 ( considered in section  4 ) by a solution we mean a _ delta wave solution _ , i.e. , a weak limit of solutions to the original problem with regularized initial data that does not depend on a particular regularization .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for a more detailed definition and motivation of delta waves .",
    "theorem  [ thm : delta ] in section  4 establishes the existence of a delta wave solution for a version of ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the regularity of initial conditions ( [ eq:2 ] ) constraints the regularity of a solution if the latter is considered in the entire domain @xmath25 .",
    "however , the influence of the initial data can be suppressed if the regularity behavior is considered in dynamics , starting from a point of time @xmath26 .",
    "a solution @xmath4 to problem ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) is called _ smoothing _ if , whatever @xmath27 , there exists @xmath28 such that @xmath29 .",
    "our main result is a smoothingness criterion for solutions to problem ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) in terms of the layout of characteristic curves ( theorems  [ thm : i ] and  [ thm : reg - delta ] ) . in the case of classical boundary condition",
    ", the criterion implies that the solution is smoothing whenever @xmath30 for all @xmath31 . as another consequence ,",
    "we obtain a class of boundary conditions under which the wave equation has smoothing solutions ( see  @xcite for a special case of this result ) .",
    "our analysis of problem ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) shows a phenomenon usually observed in the situations when solutions to hyperbolic pdes change their regularity : the smoothness changes jump - like rather than gradually .",
    "another feature of problem ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) shown in  @xcite is that , even if we allow non - lipschitz nonlinearities in ( [ eq:3 ] ) , this system demonstrates almost linear behavior .",
    "the smoothingness effect in the non - lipschitz setting contrasts with blowups  @xcite observed in many nonlinear systems .    in @xcite",
    ", results similar to ours are obtained in some more special cases , namely for homogeneous linear boundary conditions of local type with constant coefficients and continuous initial data . some restrictions on ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] )",
    "are imposed in  @xcite by technical reasons , as the authors use an approach based on the laplace transformation and the green s function method .",
    "we extend these results to the case of general linear first - order hyperbolic systems , nonlinear nonlocal boundary conditions , and distributional initial data of the dirac delta type and derivatives thereof .",
    "note that we use a different approach based on the classical method of characteristics .",
    "this method suits well for understanding of the mechanism of the smoothingness effect .",
    "an essential technical difficulty to overcome in demonstrating the regularity self - improvement is caused by the fact that the domain of influence of initial conditions ( [ eq:2 ] ) is in general infinite . in other words , the regularity of solutions all",
    "the time depends on the regularity of the initial data . however , this dependence is different for the boundary and the integral parts of the equivalent integral form of problem ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) .",
    "since the boundary summands are compositions of boundary data with functions defining characteristic curves and hence are `` responsible '' for propagation of singularities , the smoothingness effect is encountered whenever the boundary summands have a `` bounded memory '' or , more rigorously , all characteristics of ( [ eq:1 ] ) are bounded and each boundary singularity expands inside @xmath25 along a finite number of characteristic curves .",
    "our strategy of obtaining the smoothingness criterion consists in identifying an appropriate class of boundary conditions ensuring the `` bounded memory '' property and in showing that the integral summands do eventually improve upon the regularity of the initial data .",
    "it is important for our analysis that the lower order terms , with the exception of the diagonal ones , contribute into the integral summands transversely to characteristic directions .",
    "this is ensured by ( [ eq : l1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the integral part of the system causes no propagation of singularities and , moreover , suppresses it .",
    "the mathematical motivation of the paper is the scope of the stability theory , the hopf bifurcation analysis , and the investigation of small periodic forcing of stationary solutions of hyperbolic pdes .",
    "the main reason why those techniques are well established for nonlinear odes and parabolic pdes , but not for nonlinear hyperbolic pdes , is that , in contrast to parabolic case , hyperbolic operators in general do not improve the regularity of their solutions in time ( the question is closely related to propagation of singularities along characteristic curves ) .",
    "this complicates , in particular , proving the fredholmness property of the linearizations which is crucial for the analysis of solutions to nonlinear problems .",
    "we provide a range of boundary conditions ensuring the desired smoothingness effect , which still makes possible to handle the bifurcation analysis of a class of nonlinear problems ( this idea goes back to @xcite ) .",
    "the practical motivation is caused by applications to mathematical biology  @xcite , chemical kinetics ( describing mass transition in terms of convective diffusion and chemical reaction and analysis of chemical processes in counterflow chemical reactors  @xcite ) , and semiconductor laser dynamics ( describing the appearance of self - pulsations of lasers and modulation of stationary laser states by time periodic electric pumping  @xcite ) .",
    "here we consider the case of continuous initial data @xmath32 .",
    "we will assume the zero - order compatibility conditions between ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) , namely @xmath33 where @xmath34 by @xmath35 we denote the euclidian norm in @xmath36 .
