    "the concept of wavelets in its present theoretical form was first introduced in the 1970s by jean morlet and the team of the marseille theoretical physics center in france working under the supervision of alex grossmann .",
    "grossmann and morlet@xcite developed then the geometrical formalism of the continuous wavelet transform .",
    "wavelets analysis has since become a popular tool for engineers .",
    "it is today used by electrical engineers engaged for processing and analyzing non - stationary signals and it has also found applications in audio and video compression .",
    "less than ten years ago , some researchers proposed the use of wavelet analysis for modal identification purposes . however , use of wavelet transforms in real world mechanical engineering applications remains limited certainly due to widespread ignorance of their properties .",
    "this paper presents two ways of using the continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) for modal parameter identification according to the type of measured responses : free decay or frequency response functions ( frf ) .    in 1997 , staszewski @xcite and ruzzene @xcite started to use wavelet analysis with the morlet wavelet for the processing of free decay responses , but the identification of the mode shapes was not performed .",
    "wavelet transform allows to reach the time variation of instantaneous amplitude and phase of each component within the signal and makes the identification procedure of modal parameters much easier .",
    "compared to other mother wavelets , morlet wavelet provides better energy localizing and higher frequency resolution but has a disadvantage : frequency - coordinate window shifts along frequency axis with scaling while other wavelet types only expands the window . to remedy it , lardies et al .",
    "@xcite and slavic et al .",
    "@xcite preferred the gabor wavelet .",
    "argoul et al .",
    "@xcite chose the cauchy wavelet and le et al .",
    "@xcite established a complete modal identification procedure with improvements for numerical implementation , especially for a correct choice of the time - frequency localization .",
    "edge effects are seen by all the authors and some attempts to reduce their negative influence on modal parameter identification are presented in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recently , staszewski @xcite , bellizzi et al .",
    "@xcite and argoul et al .",
    "@xcite adapted their identification procedure in order to process free responses of nonlinear systems . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed four instantaneous indicators , the discrepancy of which from linear case facilitates the detection and characterization of the non - linear behaviour of structures . in @xcite , an identification procedure of the coupled non - linear modes is proposed and tested on different types of non - linear elastic dynamic systems .",
    "typically , cwt is applied to time or spatial signals .",
    "processing frequency signals is unusual , but a first application was proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "argoul showed in @xcite that the weighted integral transform ( wit ) previously introduced by jzquel et al .",
    "@xcite for modal identification purposes can be expressed by means of a wavelet transform using a complex - valued mother wavelet close to the cauchy wavelet .",
    "the wit can be applied to either the ratio of the time derivative of the frf  over the frf or the frf itself .",
    "the representation with cwt provided a better understanding of the amplification effects of the wit .",
    "when the frf signal is strongly perturbed by noise , its derivative is hard to obtain ; thus , yin et al .",
    "@xcite then proposed a slightly modified integral transform directly applied to the frf and called the singularities analysis function ( saf ) of order @xmath0 .",
    "it allows the influence of the frf s poles to be emphasized and direct estimation of the eigen frequencies , eigen modes , and modal damping ratios is performed from the study of the extrema of the wit .",
    "a wavelet expansion uses translations and dilations of an analyzing function called the mother wavelet @xmath1 . for a continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) , the translation and dilation parameters : @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , vary continuously . in other words ,",
    "the cwt uses shifted and scaled copies of @xmath4 : @xmath5 whose @xmath6 norms ( @xmath7 ) are independent of @xmath3 . in the following , @xmath8 is assumed to be a smooth function , whose modulus of fourier transform is peaked at a particular frequency @xmath9 called the  central  frequency .",
    "the variable @xmath10 may represent either time or frequency ; when necessary , the time and circular frequency variables will be referred to @xmath11 and to @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the cwt of a function @xmath13 can then be defined by the inner product between @xmath14 and @xmath15@xmath16(b , a)=\\left\\langle u,\\psi _ { b , a}\\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{a}\\int_{-\\infty } ^{+\\infty } u(x)\\,\\overline{\\psi } \\left ( \\frac{x - b}{a}\\right ) dx   \\label{deficwt}\\ ] ] where @xmath17  is the complex conjugate of @xmath18 . using parseval s identity , eq .",

    "the area of @xmath39 is constant and equal to four times the uncertainty : @xmath40 . the heisenberg uncertainty",
    "principle states that this area has to be greater than @xmath41 .    referring to the conventional frequency analysis of constant-@xmath42  filters , the parameter @xmath42 defined as the ratio of the frequency centre @xmath36 to the frequency bandwidth ( @xmath43 ) : @xmath44 is introduced in @xcite to compare different mother wavelets and to characterize the quality of the cwt . @xmath42  is independent of @xmath3 .",
