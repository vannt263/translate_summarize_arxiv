    "it is well known that probabilities of transitions induced by a time dependence of the hamiltonian are suppressed if the dependence is slow .",
    "this statement formulated and proved by born and fock@xcite is presented in standard textbooks ( e.g. by messiah@xcite ) and known as the _ adiabatic theorem_. the adiabatic theorem does not prove that the transitions are forbidden , it means just that the probabilities are suppressed exponentially and vanish to any finite order of the standard perturbation theory .",
    "transitions of this type should not be discarded , however , if they result in special phenomena , even though relatively rare ones .",
    "the over - barrier reflection and the spin - flip in a time - dependent magnetic field slowly deviating from the original direction may serve as simple examples of such phenomena .",
    "usually , the adiabatic character of the process suggests a way to evaluate its probability , like in the quasi - classical approximation .",
    "corrections to the adiabatic theorem were considered in a number of works , especially with application to physical systems with two non - degenerate energy levels .",
    "dykhne@xcite considered a hamiltonian @xmath2 with two eigenstates @xmath3 which is analytic in time .",
    "he found the transition probability @xmath4 for a system , prepared at time @xmath5 in the eigenstate @xmath6 to pass to the eigenstate @xmath7 as @xmath8 runs from @xmath5 to @xmath9 .",
    "this probability is expressed by the formula : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is a point in the complex time plane in which @xmath12 and @xmath13 cross , and @xmath14 is a time - scale parameter ( large in the adiabatic limit ) over which @xmath2 changes essentially .",
    "a rigorous derivation of dykhne s result was given by davis and pechukas@xcite .",
    "suominen , garraway and stenholm@xcite,@xcite have applied the dykhne , davis and pechukas approach to two - level solvable models . in particular , an adiabatic behavior of the landau and zener @xcite , @xcite model was considered .",
    "it appears that for this model the dykhne , davis and pechukas method gives the exact answer .    from the works of berry@xcite , joye , kunz and pfister@xcite , jaki and",
    "segert@xcite,@xcite it becomes clear that similar to berry adiabatic phase@xcite , the transition probabilities induced by a time dependence of the hamiltonian are connected with the geometry of the parameter space .",
    "in particular , when the evolution of a system is described by the hamiltonian of the form @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is a parameter dependent unit vector and @xmath17 are pauli matrices ) in the first - order adiabatic perturbation theory the transition ( spin - flip ) @xmath18 is determined by the fourier transform @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite : @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is related with the riemannian length element @xmath22 of the unit sphere .",
    "the function @xmath23 is given by the integral @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the geodesic curvature of a path @xmath16 : @xmath26 we note that the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) defines a curve in the lie algebra @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding evolution operator belongs to the fundamental @xmath28 representation of the group @xmath0 and the transition probability appears to be completelly determined by the geometric properties of the @xmath0 group homogeneous space @xmath29 ( which serves as the parameter space for this particular situation ) .",
    "it is the main purpose of this work to establish a relation between the probabilities of the non - adiabatic transitions and the geometry of the parameter space in a more general than the mentioned above case .",
    "namely , we consider a situation when the commutator algebra of the hamiltonian operators @xmath30 at different values of parameter @xmath31 is closed for all @xmath31 , constituting an arbitrary lie algebra @xmath32 .",
    "this condition makes it possible to reformulate the original problem about the evolution of a quantum state in terms of a first - order dynamic equation on the group manifold ( section 2 ) .",
    "the adiabatic solution of this equation is constructed in section 3 , and the integral expression for the lie algebra element , determining transition probabilities , is derived . in section 4 our approach is applied to the spin precession in a variable external field .",
    "the adiabatic approximation for the spin precession@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite is reconstructed .",
    "applied to the ordinary one - dimensional schrdinger equation , our method gives the well - known wkbj solution as the first adiabatic approximation . in the leading ( second- ) order approximation our approach leads to bremmer s formula@xcite for the over - barrier reflection ( section 5 ) . in section 6 an expression for the transition probability due to a parametric excitation of a quantum oscillator",
    "is obtained from our results .",
    "section 7 is devoted to a comparison of our calculations with exact solutions for a number of analytically solvable models .",
    "we consider the linear operator ( matrix ) equation of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the unit operator and @xmath35 has a given time dependence .",
    "this is a pattern for a number of physical problems , including the one - dimensional schrdinger equation and the spin precession in a time - dependent magnetic field . if the commutator algebra of operators @xmath35 is closed for all @xmath8 , constituting a lie algebra @xmath36 , one deals actually with the first - order dynamical equations on the lie group @xmath37 , generated by @xmath36 . now",
    "the problem can be written in terms of the cartan ",
    "maurer one - form , @xmath38 with the initial condition @xmath39 - the unit element of @xmath40 .",

    "it is notable that the desired group element may be shifted by a properly chosen amount @xmath45 , so the equation is rewritten in an equivalent form , @xmath46 , @xmath47 thus the problem may be reduced to a more tractable one .",
    "let us restrict ourselves to problems where @xmath41 approaches a cartan subalgebra @xmath48 asymptotically , as @xmath49 , and evaluate the transition probability between eigen - states of operators representing @xmath48 .",

    "we consider the problems where @xmath41 belongs to the cartan subalgebra asymptotically , at @xmath49 , so @xmath61 .",
    "the equation resulting from ( [ cm ] ) would be @xmath62 splitting this equation to the subalgebras @xmath48 and @xmath63 , we get a set of differential equations for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we find an approximate solution of the eq.([eq.9 ] ) for _ adiabatic _ processes , where the @xmath8-dependence of @xmath59 is slow , the derivative @xmath66 is small , and the condition @xmath67 is satisfied . here",

    "when the condition ( [ eq.10 ] ) holds , @xmath65 is always close to @xmath59 , and the deviation of @xmath72 from the subgroup @xmath48 is negligible .",

    "this leads to the same condition of applicability as in the wkbj approximation , @xmath170 ) coinsides with the over - barrier reflection amplitude obtained by bremmer@xcite .",
    "bremmer s approximation was to divide a smooth potential into a large number of small layers .",
    "the momentum @xmath171 , being different in different layers , was assumed to be constant throughout a range of a particular layer . the ordinary wkbj solution eq.([wkbj ] ) was then obtained by discarding all reflections of the incident wave at any layer s boundary .",
    "assuming that only single reflections at all boundaries of the layers take place , bremmer found the over - barrier reflection amplitude .",
    "an advantage of our procedure is that leading to the same result ( eq.([amplituda ] ) ) as bremmer s approach , our derivation does not demand any assumptions about qualitative character of the wave reflection .",

    "the momentum @xmath171 becomes approximately equal to @xmath177 .",

    "the general case with a time - dependent @xmath182 and @xmath183 may be easily reduced to @xmath184=const by changing variables @xmath185 , @xmath186 .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the wave function of the quantum oscillator has the following form : @xmath187 for @xmath183 the asymptotic conditions @xmath188 are assumed .",
    "the assymptotic stationary states are : @xmath189 @xmath190 the time - dependence of the quantum oscillator parameters @xmath182 and @xmath183 allows for the transitions between different stationary states .",
    "a typical problem is to calculate the probability of transitions @xmath191 from the state @xmath192 with the asymptotic @xmath193 at @xmath194 to the asymptotic state @xmath195 at @xmath196 . as is well known ( e.g. baz , zeldovich and perelomov@xcite ) , in order to determine this probability of transitions @xmath191 it is sufficient to calculate the quantum mechanical coefficient @xmath197 of the over - barrier reflection from the one - dimensional potential of a particle with momentum @xmath198 , where @xmath199 is the frequency function of the quantum oscillator .",
    "however , the analytic solution of the over - barrier reflection problem is known only for a number of special cases . when it is impossible to find an analytic solution for the problem of the over - barrier reflection , our approximated approach developed in section ( [ reflection ] ) may be applied . the approximated expression for the quntum mechanical coefficient @xmath197",
    "is given by the formula ( [ amplituda ] ) , i.e. : @xmath200 when the parameter @xmath197 is determined , the probability of transitions @xmath191 may be calculated using the perelomov and popov@xcite formula : @xmath201 where @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 are the associated legendre functions .",
    "the exact solution of the spin precession problem of section 4 is known@xcite for the magnetic field @xmath205 here @xmath206 is the asymptotical precession frequency , @xmath14 is the pulse duration . the applicability condition eq.([spinapl ] ) allows for the application of our approach , when the inequality @xmath207 is satisfied .",
    "when @xmath208 , the inequality ( [ spininequality ] ) holds for all @xmath209 and the process would be adiabatic .",
    "respectively , the perturbation theory can be applied for @xmath210 . as known from the analytical solution of eq.([1 ] ) given in terms of the hyper - geometric function , @xmath211 ^ 2.\\ ] ] calculating the integrals in ( [ spinamplitude ] ) , it is usefull to change the variables as follows @xmath212 taking the integral for @xmath213 with @xmath214 , we have @xmath215 @xmath216 \\frac{\\tanh\\xi d\\xi}{(\\cosh^2\\xi- \\sin^2k)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\ ] ] the latter integral is reduced to a real form , as the pulse is symmetrical under the time inversion , so @xmath217 is odd .",
    "the numerical calculation shows a wonderful accuracy of the approximation , namely , @xmath218 even for moderate values of @xmath219 , in a wide range of @xmath209 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the analytic expression for the reflection amplitude is @xmath221 in the above formula the parameters @xmath222 and @xmath223 were introduced .",
    "perturbation theory may be applied when @xmath224 , i.e. @xmath225 . in that case",
    "the reflection probability is equal to @xmath226 next , we consider the situation when @xmath227 . as follows from the inequality ( [ wkbcondition ] ) , in the cases when @xmath228 the over - barrier probability amplitude may be calculated by our method .",
    "it is suitable to change the variables @xmath229 and calculate the integral in the exponent of formula ( [ amplituda ] ) .",
    "we obtain the following integral expression for the over - barrier reflection probability amplitude : @xmath230 a comparison of the exact and approximate ( see figure 2 ) probability amplitudes demonstrates a very good accuracy of the approximation ( [ amplituda ] ) , namely @xmath231",
    "in this paper we have proposed an adiabatic approach to the calculation of probabilities for quantum transitions . in the case",
    "when the one - parameter dependent hamiltonian represents a smooth curve in a lie algebra , the original schrdinger equation was interpreted as the dynamical equation on the corresponding group manifold .",
    "the main result of this work is expressed by eq.([14 ] ) that determines the lie algebra element responsible for the non - adiabatic transitions .",
    "the problem of over - barrier reflection in one - dimensional quantum mechanics is very similar in our approach to the problem of spin - flip in a variable magnetic field ( the difference lies in the fact that for the over - barrier reflection problem the introduced evolution operator is an element of the group su(1.1 ) , and not of su(2 ) , as the spin evolution operator ) .",
    "we have tested our approach on simple problems for which approximate solutions are known . in the case of a spin in a time - dependent magnetic field",
    "our procedure leads to a spin - flip amplitude eq.([spinamplitude ] ) . in the adiabatic limit eq.([spinamplitude ] ) would coincide with the berry@xcite , joye , kunz and pfister@xcite , jaki and segert@xcite,@xcite result for the spin - flip probability amplitude .",
    "the application of our procedure to the over - barrier reflection gives bremmer s formula@xcite in the leading ( second- ) order approximation .",
    "it is remarkable that in order to obtain bremmer s result , the usual condition of the validity of wkbj approximation ( eq.([wkbj ] ) ) is only needed .",
    "being checked for two solvable models ( the spin - flip in the rosen - zener magnetic field and the over - barrier reflection for the potential @xmath232 ) , our adiabatic approximation not only gives the exponentially small character of the probabilities of the non - adiabatic processes , but completely describes the qualitative behavior of these probabilities as functions of the external parameters .",
    "the integrals ( [ spinamplitude ] ) , ( [ amplituda ] ) show the same behavior under variation of the magnetic field amplitude ( the amplitude of the potential ) as the exact solutions .",
    "it is interesting to note that in spite of the same condition of applicability as the wkbj approximation , our approach is very successful in the calculation of the over - barrier reflection while the usual wkbj approximation gives zero answer in all orders .",
    "the reason is that the wkbj approximation is an asymptotic series that is unable to take the exponentially small variables into account .",
