    "<S> the final ( desired ) structure is encoded in the shape and properties of the designed building blocks . </S>",
    "<S> realizations of complex self - assembled nano aggregates  @xcite have been guided by intuition and sophisticated experimental techniques . </S>",
    "<S> a full comprehension of the self - assembly process requires the ability to predict the structures ( and their relative abundance ) which will be observed in equilibrium , as a function of @xmath0 and density @xmath1 , starting from the knowledge of the inter - particle interaction potential . </S>",
    "<S> such a request is very much akin to the one that has guided the development of the physics of liquids in the last decades . differently from the simple liquid case , self - assembly </S>",
    "<S> is characterized by a very strong inter - particle attraction ( significantly larger than the thermal energy @xmath2 ) and by the fact that the interaction geometry is far from being spherical . </S>",
    "<S> the leading `` bonding '' interaction may indeed be localized in a specific part of the particle surface ( patchy interactions  @xcite ) , it may be active only in the presence of a specific complementary group ( lock - and - key interactions , very often encountered in biological self - assembly  @xcite ) or it may be strongly dependent on the particle orientation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of strong and patchy interactions poses significant challenges to a parameter - free description of self - assembly . </S>",
    "<S> only equilibrium chain polymerization , the simplest self - assembly process which takes place when bi - functional particles self - assemble into chains of variable length , can be considered to be sufficiently established  @xcite .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> we show that for systems with a small average functionality ( but larger than two ) it is possible to provide a parameter - free full description of the self - assembly process . </S>",
    "<S> we study theoretically and numerically one of the simplest , but not trivial self - assembly process , namely a binary mixture of particles with two and three attractive sites . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of three ( or more ) -functional particles  which act as branching points in the self - assembled clusters  introduces two important phenomena which are missing in equilibrium chain polymerization : a percolation transition , where a spanning cluster appears , and a region of thermodynamic instability , the analog of a gas - liquid phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> more explicitly , we investigate a binary mixture composed by @xmath3 bi - functional particles and @xmath4 three - functional ones . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting average number of sticky spots per particle , i.e. the average functionality , is @xmath5 . </S>",

    "<S> sites on different particles interact via a square - well potential @xmath7 of depth @xmath8 and attraction range @xmath9 . more precisely , the interaction potential @xmath10 between particles * 1 * and * 2 * is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hard - sphere potential and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the vectors joining the particle - particle centers and the site - site ( on different particles ) locations ; @xmath15 indicates the number of sites of particle @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> sites are located on the poles in the case of bi - functional particles and equidistant on the equator in the case of three - functional particles . with this site geometry , </S>",
    "<S> the smallest possible bonded ring requires six three - functional particles , while a bonded ring of only bi - functional units requires @xmath17 particles . </S>",
    "<S> the well width @xmath18 is chosen to ensure that each site , due to steric effect , is engaged at most in one interaction . </S>",

    "<S> temperature is measured in units of the potential depth ( i.e. boltzmann constant @xmath19 ) . in the studied model , bonding </S>",
    "<S> is properly defined : two particles are bonded when their pair interaction energy is -@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the potential energy of the system is proportional to the number of bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest energy state of the system ( the ground state energy ) coincides with configurations in which all bonds are formed , i.e @xmath20 . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the bond probability , @xmath21 , can be precisely calculated as the ratio of the potential energy @xmath22 and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> pairs of bonded particles are assumed to belong to the same cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> we have performed standard monte carlo ( mc ) metropolis simulations at several @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( more than 70 different state points ) . </S>",
    "<S> an mc step is defined as an attempted move per particle . </S>",
    "<S> a move is defined as a displacement of a randomly selected particle in each direction of a random quantity distributed uniformly between @xmath24 and a rotation around a random axis of a random angle uniformly distributed between @xmath25 radiant . </S>",
    "<S> equilibration was monitored via the evolution of the potential energy ( a direct measure of the number of bonds in the system ) . </S>",
    "<S> equilibration at the lowest @xmath0 required up to @xmath26 mc steps ( 6 months of simulation time ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , at @xmath27 , a bond breaks in average every @xmath28 attempts .    </S>",
    "<S> the extremely long monte carlo simulations provide a numerically `` exact '' description of the equilibrium self - assembly process in this model . on cooling particles aggregate in open larger and larger clusters which then coalesce into a spanning structure , eventually incorporating all particles . a pictorial representation of the structure of the system on varying @xmath0 ( both below , at and above percolation ) is shown in fig </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : picture ] . </S>",
    "<S> clusters are composed by rather stiff chains of bi - functional particles cross - linked by the three - functional ones .    to develop a parameter - free theoretical description of the cluster formation we combine wertheim ( w ) theory  @xcite for estimating the @xmath0 and @xmath1 dependence of @xmath21 with the flory - stockmayer ( fs ) predictions for the cluster size distribution in chemical gelation , providing a detailed and predictive theory of reversible self - assembly .    </S>",
    "<S> the wertheim theory , developed back in 1980 for describing the free energy of molecules with fixed valence ( associating liquids ) , can be transferred to particles with a small number of patchy interacting sites . </S>",
    "<S> the main assumption in the theory is that molecules ( or particles ) cluster in open structures without closed bond loops . </S>",
    "<S> such a condition , as we will show in the following , can be realized with patchy particles when the average functionality is small and the chains of bi - functional particles are not significantly flexible . </S>",
    "<S> the wertheim theory predicts that @xmath21 can be calculated from the chemical equilibrium between two non - bonded sites forming a bonded pair . for the present model , </S>",
    "<S> such relation reads :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the reference hard - sphere radial distribution function , @xmath32 is the mayer @xmath33-function between two arbitrary sites @xmath16 and @xmath34 , and @xmath35 represents an angle average over all orientations of the two particles at fixed relative distance @xmath36  @xcite . the comparison between the theoretical predictions and the `` exact '' numerical data for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 dependence of @xmath21 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pb ] . </S>",
    "<S> data show clearly that the theory is able to predict precisely @xmath21 ( or equivalently the system potential energy ) in a wide @xmath0 and @xmath1 range . at low @xmath0 , @xmath37 , and </S>",
    "<S> the system approaches a fully bonded disordered ( ground state ) configuration .    to derive information on the structure of the system and the connectivity of the aggregates we connect the w and the fs theories . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the hypothesis of absence of closed bonding loops is at the basis of both theoretical approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the w prediction for @xmath21 can thus be consistently used in connection with the fs approach  @xcite to predict the @xmath0 and @xmath1 dependence of the cluster size distributions . in the present case , the number of clusters ( per unit volume ) containing @xmath38 bi - functional particles and @xmath39 three - funtional ones can be written  @xcite as @xmath40 ^n [ p_{2 } p_b ] ^l   w_{nl}\\\\ \\nonumber w_{nl } & = & 3   \\frac{(l+3n - n)!}{l ! n ! ( n+2)!}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the probabilities that a randomly chosen site belongs to a three - functional or to a bi - functional particle , @xmath21 is given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : pb ] , and @xmath43 is a combinatorial contribution  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> distributions are normalized in such a way that @xmath44 . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : csd]-(top ) , on decreasing @xmath0 , the @xmath45 distribution becomes wider and wider and develops a power - law tail with exponent -2.5 , characteristic of loop - less percolation  @xcite . on further decreasing @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of finite size clusters progressively shrinks , since most of the particles attach themselves to the infinite cluster . </S>",
    "<S> data show that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : rholm ] , with no fitting parameters , predicts extremely well the numerical distributions at all state points , both above and below percolation .    </S>",
    "<S> the three - functional particles act as branching points of the network formed by long chains of two - functional particles . visualizing the structure of the system in term of chains of two - coordinated particles providing a link between the three - coordinates ones , it is possible to predict the number of finite size clusters composed of @xmath39 three - functional units , irrespective of the number of bifunctional units . </S>",
    "<S> the system can thus be considered as a one - component fluid of three - functional particles forming clusters , in which the bonding distance between the three - functional particles is given by the length of the chains formed by the bi - functional units . following again fs , it is possible to predict the @xmath21 value at which the systems develops a percolating structure : when @xmath46 , an infinite cluster is present in the system . </S>",
    "<S> the percolation line is thus the locus of points in the phase diagram such that @xmath47 , with @xmath48 given in eq.[eq : pb ] . along the percolation locus </S>",
    "<S> , the product @xmath49 ( @xmath50 at low @xmath0 ) is constant ( from eq.[eq : pb ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to predict the length distribution of chains of bi - functional particles . the number of chains ( per unit volume ) of length @xmath38 , normalized in such a way that @xmath51 , is @xmath52 the @xmath53 distribution is thus always exponential . at low @xmath0 , when @xmath37 , the distribution becomes controlled only by the relative fraction of two - functional particles , providing a method for tuning the porosity of the fully connected percolating structure via the relative composition of the binary mixture . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath37 , the average distance @xmath54 between branching points in the network becomes only a function of @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56 . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : csd]-(bottom ) shows that also the @xmath53 distribution is perfectly described by the combined w - fs theory .    in the framework of fs approach </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to evaluate the number density of clusters @xmath57 as a function of @xmath21 , irrespectively of the cluster size . </S>",
    "<S> below percolation , in the absence of bonding loops , the relation between @xmath58 and @xmath21 is linear , since each added bond decreases the number of clusters by one . above percolation </S>",
    "<S> the relation crosses to a non - linear behavior , so that the number of clusters becomes one when @xmath59 . within the fs theory </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath58 can be calculate for all @xmath21 values , assuming that finite clusters do not contain closed loops . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ncl ] , the simulation data conform perfectly to the theoretical expectation both below and above percolation . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that , when the average functionality is small and the chains of bi - functional particles have a large persistence length , bonding loops in finite size clusters can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement , which covers the entire range of @xmath21 values , implies that closed loops of bonds are statistically less favored than the corresponding open structure . the relative statistical weight results from the competition between the energy of forming the extra additional bond and the reduction of entropy associated to the closure of the loop . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we interpret the absence of closed loops as resulting from the large configurational entropy of the long bi - functional chains .    </S>",
    "<S> to further check the quality of the theory , we numerically evaluate the connectivity properties of each studied state point , searching for the presence of clusters which are infinite under periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> a state point is considered percolating when , accounting for periodic boundary conditions , an infinite cluster is present in more than 50@xmath60 configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting partitioning of the state points into percolating and non - percolating ones ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phase ] ) is fully consistent with the theoretical prediction of the percolation line @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the theory also predict a line of constant volume specific heat @xmath62 maxima ( also observed in chain polymerization  @xcite ) , provided by the inflection point in the @xmath21 vs. @xmath0 curves ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pb ] ) , which also agrees very well with the simulation results . the line of @xmath62 extrema is also shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phase ] . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a maximum in @xmath62 is a characteristic of bond - driven assembly and the locus of maxima in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane is one of the precursors of the self - assembly process for low functionality particles .    </S>",
    "<S> the w theory predicts a liquid - gas phase separation at small @xmath1 for any non - vanishing amount of branching point  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> according to the theory , at low @xmath0 and sufficiently small @xmath1 the system phase separates into two phases of different density and connectivity . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical spinodal curve , the line separating the stable ( or metastable ) state points from the unstable ones , is defined as the locus of points such that the volume @xmath63 derivative of the pressure @xmath64 vanishes , i.e. @xmath65 . for the present model , it is located below the percolation line and the two lines merge asymptotically for @xmath66 and @xmath67 as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phase ] . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the numerical configurations for the two investigated state points which happened to be located inside the spinodal are indeed characterized by a bimodal distribution of the density fluctuations and a very large value of the small - angle structure factor , indicating a phase - separated structure . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that , in the absence of bonded rings , also the region of liquid - gas instability can be predicted using the w theory . </S>",
    "<S> the role of bond - rings on the thermodynamic of thermoreversible gels has been recently discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , this work provides the first fully solvable example of an equilibrium self - assembly process which goes beyond the equilibrium chain polymerization , complementing recent numerical studies and attempts at direct comparison between theory and simulation in related systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a non negligible number of three - valent particles brings in a percolation phenomenon and a gas - liquid instability . </S>",
    "<S> these two loci are located in the region of @xmath0 below the @xmath62 maximum , suggesting a cascade of phenomena characterizing the self - assembly process in systems with low @xmath68 : onset of bonding ( @xmath62 max ) , percolation and , eventually at low @xmath1 , phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting phase diagram bears strong similarities with the ones discussed in previous mean field  @xcite and numerical  @xcite studies of thermoreversible gelation .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of theoretically describing the self - assembly process in the present model , designed to minimize the closed - bond loops effects , provides a benchmark for testing novel approaches and approximations accounting for more general cases . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the predictions makes it possible to exploit a fine tuning of the percolation properties . using the recently synthesized colloidal particles  @xcite or functionalizing colloids  @xcite it will be possible , by choosing the appropriate @xmath1 and @xmath0 , to generate materials with specific connectivity lengths , gels with desired porosity or build on the fractal nature of the self - assembled clusters . the material structure can be made permanent , if needed , by freezing the bonding pattern with a fast cooling process .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , @xmath21 appears to be the effective parameter controlling the structure of the system , since configurations at different @xmath1 and @xmath0 but equal @xmath21 are characterized by the same distribution of cluster sizes . </S>",
    "<S> configurations only differ in the relative distance between these clusters and , more interesting , on the lifetime of the resulting bonds , @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus in principle possible to decouple the effects related to the persistence of the clusters as units and the dynamics of clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of interpolating in a continuous and structural preserving way from chemical to physical gels may offer a unifying picture of these two apparently different arrest processes . </S>"
