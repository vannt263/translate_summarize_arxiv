    "the study of mixing in the @xmath40 and @xmath41 sectors has provided a wealth of information to guide the form and content of the standard model . in the framework of the standard model , mixing in the charm meson sector",

    "similarly , measurable _ cp _ violation ( cpv ) phenomena in strange  @xcite and beauty  @xcite mesons are the impetus for many current and future experiments  @xcite .",
    "the standard model predictions for cpv for charm mesons are of the order of @xmath42  @xcite , with one recent conjecture of nearly @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "observation of cpv in charm mesons exceeding the percent level would be strong evidence for non - standard model processes .",
    "a @xmath0 can evolve into a @xmath44 through `` ordinary '' on - shell intermediate states , or through off - shell intermediate states such as as those that might be present due to new physics .",
    "we denote the amplitude through the former ( latter ) states by @xmath45 @xmath46 , in units of @xmath47  @xcite . the standard model contributions to @xmath48",
    "are suppressed to @xmath49 and the glashow - illiopolous - maiani  @xcite cancelation could further suppress @xmath50 down to @xmath51 .",
    "many non - standard model processes could lead to @xmath52 .",
    "contributions to @xmath48 at this level could result from the presence of new particles with masses as high as 100  1000 tev  @xcite .",
    "signatures of new physics include @xmath53 and _ cp _ violating interference between @xmath48 and @xmath54 or between @xmath48 and a direct decay amplitude .",
    "wrong sign ( ws ) processes , such as @xmath6 , can proceed directly through doubly cabbibo - suppressed decay ( dcsd ) or through mixing and subsequent cabbibo favored decay ( cfd ) . both dcsd and mixing followed by cfd",
    "can contribute to the time integrated ws rate , @xmath55 and the inclusive _ cp _ asymmetry @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the charge conjugated quantity , and @xmath59 is a wrong - sign final state , such as @xmath60 .",
    "the different contributions to @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be separated by studying the proper decay time dependence of ws final states , as we have done in @xmath63  @xcite , and has been done by focus in @xcite .",
    "the differential ws rate relative to the right - sign ( rs ) process , in time units of the mean @xmath0 lifetime , @xmath64  @xcite , is @xmath65 e^{-t}$ ]  @xcite , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the relative rate of dcsd and @xmath69 is the strong phase between the dcsd and cfd amplitudes .",
    "there are theoretical arguments that @xmath69 should be small  @xcite , although this should not be taken for granted .",
    "the coefficient of the term quadratic in @xmath70 is proportional to the relative rate of mixing , @xmath71 .",
    "all of the analyses discussed herein , unless otherwise stated , use the same data set and reconstruction techniques described below .",
    "the data set was accumulated between february 1996 and february 1999 and corresponds to @xmath72 of @xmath73 collision data at @xmath74 gev provided by the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) .",
    "the data were recorded by the cleo ii detector  @xcite upgraded with the installation of a silicon vertex detector ( svx )  @xcite and by changing the drift chamber gas from an argon - ethane mixture to a helium - propane mixture  @xcite .",
    "the upgraded configuration is referred to as cleo ii.v .",
    "the monte carlo simulation of the cleo ii.v detector was based upon geant  @xcite , and simulated events were processed in the same manner as the data .",
    "the @xmath0 candidates are reconstructed through the decay sequence @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "the charge of the slow pion ( @xmath76 ) tags the flavor of the @xmath0 candidate at production .",
    "the charged daughters of the @xmath0 are required to leave hits in the svx and these tracks are constrained to come from a common vertex in three dimensions .",
    "the trajectory of the @xmath0 is projected back to its intersection with the cesr luminous region to obtain the @xmath0 production point .",
    "the @xmath76 is refit with the requirement that it come from the @xmath0 production point , and the confidence level of the @xmath77 of this refit is used to reject background .    the energy release in the @xmath78 decay , @xmath79 , obtained from the above technique",
    "is observed to have a width of @xmath80 kev  @xcite , which is a combination of the intrinsic width and our resolution , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the reconstructed masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath83 candidates respectively , and @xmath84 is the charged pion mass .",
    "the reconstruction technique discussed above has also been used by cleo to measure the @xmath85 intrinsic width , @xmath86 kev ( preliminary )  @xcite . in the mixing analyses described below",
    ", the distribution of candidates in the @xmath87 vs @xmath81 plane are fit to determine both right - sign and wrong - sign yields .",
    "we calculate @xmath70 using only the vertical component of the @xmath0 candidate flight distance .",
    "this is effective because the vertical extent of the cesr luminous region has @xmath88",
    "m  @xcite .",
    "the resolution on the @xmath0 decay point ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) is typically @xmath92 m in each dimension .",

    "_ cp _ violation in charm meson decay is expected to be small in the standard model , which makes charm meson decay a good place to look for non - standard model effects .",
    "cabbibo suppressed charm meson decays have all the necessary ingredients for _ cp _ violation ",
    "multiple paths to the same final state and a weak phase .",
    "however , in order to get sizable _ cp _ violation , the final state interactions need to contribute non - trivial phase shifts between the amplitudes .",
    "large final state interactions are a likely reason why the prediction for the ratio of branching ratios of @xmath104 yields a value roughly half of the observed value  @xcite , hence these may provide a good hunting ground for _ cp _ violation .",
    "previous searches for mixing - induced  @xcite or direct  @xcite _ cp _ violation in the neutral charm meson system have set limits of @xmath105 or a few percent , respectively .",

    "the decay asymmetry can be obtained from the apparent production asymmetry shown above because the production of @xmath115 is _ cp_-conserving .",

    "figure  [ fig : hill ] shows our fits to both @xmath116 and @xmath117 distributions found in data , for both signs of the slow pion flavor tag .",
    "the parameters of the slow pion dominate the @xmath87 distribution , so all modes have the same shape .",
    "we do the fits in bins of @xmath0 momentum to eliminate any biases due to differences in the @xmath0 momentum spectra between the data and the mc .",
    "the preliminary results are @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "we use many different variations of the fit shapes , both empirical and analytical , to assess the systematic uncertainties due to the fitting procedure ( 0.69% ) .",
    "we also consider biases due to the detector material ( 0.07% ) , the reconstruction software ( 0.48% ) , and forward ",
    "backward acceptance variations ( @xmath120 pairs are not produced symmetrically in the forward / backward directions in @xmath73 collisions at @xmath121 gev , and the collision point was not centered exactly in the middle of the detector ) ( 0.014% ) .",
    "the measured asymmetries are consistent with zero , and no _ cp _ violation is seen .",
    "these results compared to previous measurements  @xcite are shown in figures  [ fig : hillkk ] and  [ fig : hillpp ] .",
    "this analysis  @xcite differs from the other analyses presented in this paper in some of its reconstruction techniques and in the data set used .",
    "the @xmath125 and @xmath108 final states do not provide sufficiently precise directional information about their parent @xmath0 to use the intersection of the @xmath0 projection and the cesr luminous region to refit the slow pion as described in the general experimental technique section .",
    "the @xmath110 final state is treated the same for consistency .",
    "this analysis uses the data from both the cleo ii and cleo ii.v configurations of the detector , totaling 13.7 @xmath126 of @xmath73 collision data at @xmath121 gev .",
    "the @xmath127 and @xmath128 candidates are constructed using only good quality tracks and showers . the tracks ( showers )",
    "whose combined invariant mass is close to the @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) mass are kinematically constrained to the @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) mass , improving the @xmath0 mass resolution .",
    "the tracks used to form @xmath127 candidates are required to satisfy criteria designed to reduce background from @xmath129 decays and combinatorics .",
    "candidate events with reconstructed @xmath0 masses close to the known @xmath0 mass are selected to determine the asymmetry , @xmath130 / \\left [ \\gamma ( d^0 \\rightarrow f ) +   \\gamma(\\overline{d^0 } \\rightarrow f)\\right]$ ] .",
    "the @xmath87 distributions of the candidates in the three decay modes are shown in figures [ fig : k0pi0 ] , [ fig : pi0pi0 ] , and [ fig : k0k0 ] .",
    "a prominent peak indicative of @xmath75 decay is observed in all three distributions .",
    "the total number of @xmath0 and @xmath44 candidates for a given final state is determined as follows .",
    "we fit the @xmath87 distribution outside of the signal region and interpolate the fit under the signal peak to determine the background in the signal region .",
    "we subtract the background in the signal region from the total number of events there to determine the total number of signal events .",
    "the background shape is approximated as a non - relativistic threshold function with first and second order relativistic corrections @xmath131 .",
    "after background subtraction , we obtain @xmath132 @xmath133 candidates , @xmath134 @xmath125 candidates , and @xmath135 @xmath110 candidates .",
    "the difference in the number of @xmath0 and @xmath44 to a given final state is determined by taking the difference of the number of events in the signal region , and the asymmetry is obtained by dividing by the number of candidates determined above .",
    "this method of determining the asymmetry implicitly assumes that the background is symmetric .",
    "we have searched for any sources of false asymmetries : from the @xmath76 finding ( 0.19% ) , from the fitting ( 0.5% ) , and from the backgrounds ( 0.35% @xmath108 , 0% @xmath125 and 12% @xmath110 ) .",
    "we find no significant biases , but apply the measured corrections and add their uncertainties to the total .",
    "we obtain the results @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 where the uncertainties contain the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "all systematic uncertainties , except for the 0.5% uncertainty assigned for possible bias in the fitting method , are determined from data and would be reduced in future higher luminosity samples .",
    "all measured asymmetries are consistent with zero and no indication of significant _ cp _ violation is observed .",
    "this measurement of @xmath139 is a significant improvement over previous results , and the other two asymmetries reported are first measurements .",

    "the rs mode was recently studied by cleo@xcite and found to have a rich dalitz structure consisting of @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 resonances and non - resonant contributions .",
    "recent theoretical predictions based on u - spin symmetry arguments@xcite suggest that the wrong sign ( ws ) channel will have a different resonant substructure than the right sign ( rs ) .",
    "this analysis allows for different average ws and rs efficiencies resulting from different ws and rs kinematic distributions in the calculation of the ws rate : @xmath151    the ratio of yields in eq .",

    "the backgrounds are broken down into three categories : 1 ) rs @xmath153 decay combined with an uncorrelated @xmath154 , 2 ) combinations from @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , and 3 ) combinations from charm particle decays other than the rs or ws signal modes .",
    "the background distributions are determined using a large monte carlo sample , which corresponds to approximately eight times the integrated luminosity of the data sample .",
    "the @xmath87@xmath158 fit yields a ws signal of @xmath159 events and a ratio @xmath160 .",

    "the amplitudes and phases are initialized to the rs values , and those corresponding to the @xmath163 and @xmath164 resonances are floated relative to the dominant @xmath165 and other minor contributions . combining the square of the fitted amplitude function with a parameterization of the efficiency determined using a large non - resonant monte carlo sample , we measure an average efficiency ratio of @xmath166 .",
    "studies are under way to examine the extent and the significance of this surprising similarity between the rs and ws dalitz plots .",
    "the dominant systematic errors in this analysis come from the uncertainty in the monte carlo background distributions ( 14% ) , uncertainty in the amplitudes and phases that are fixed in the fit ( 8% ) , and uncertainty in the background dalitz plot distributions ( 3% ) .",
    "several powerful checks of the @xmath87@xmath158 and dalitz plot fits are performed in order to verify the validity of these results .",
    "fits using specific background regions of the @xmath87@xmath158 plane test the sensitivity to the monte carlo background distributions .",
    "the ws dalitz plot is also fit using hypotheses which include one of the @xmath163 , @xmath164 , or @xmath165 resonances , in order to provide an upper limit on the error due to this fit .",
    "only the @xmath164 hypothesis leads to an efficiency ratio that differs significantly from one , but this hypothesis is strongly disfavored by the data .",
    "we measure the wrong sign rate to be @xmath167 this result is consistent with the cleo ii.v@xcite and focus @xcite @xmath168 measurements .",
    "this measurement of @xmath169 can be used to obtain limits on @xmath170 as a function of @xmath171 within the limits on @xmath172 set by cleo , as shown in figure  [ fig : alexrws ] .",
    "work is in progress to use the lifetime distribution of this sample to yield independent limits on @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath170 .",
    "in the limit of no @xmath174 violation in the neutral @xmath176 system we can write the time dependent rate for @xmath177 , where @xmath59 is a cp eigenstate , as @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the average @xmath176 width , @xmath180 is the @xmath174 eigenvalue for @xmath59 , and @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the width difference between the physical eigenstates of the neutral @xmath176 . in the limit",
    "that _ cp _ is conserved in charm decays , @xmath183 , where @xmath54 is the mixing parameter defined in section  [ sec : intro ] . with the @xmath174 asymmetry for @xmath184 and @xmath185 consistent with zero as discussed in section  [ sec : kkpp ] , this limit is well motivated and we will simply use @xmath54 for the rest of this section .",
    "we can then express @xmath54 as @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the lifetime of a @xmath174 neutral state , such as @xmath188 , and @xmath189 is the lifetime of a @xmath174 even state , such as @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "thus to measure @xmath54 we simply take the ratio of the lifetimes of @xmath190 to @xmath191 and @xmath185 . since the final states are very similar , our backgrounds are small and cross - feed among the final states is negligible many of the sources of uncertainty cancel in the ratio .",
    "a similar analysis has recently been published by focus comparing the @xmath188 and @xmath184 final states@xcite .",

    ", we fit their proper time distributions with an unbinned maximum likelihood fit . the proper time is measured as described in section  [ genmethod ] .",
    "the signal likelihood function is an exponential convolved with three resolution gaussians .",
    "the width of the primary gaussian is due to the propagation of errors from the track fit to the flight distance and momentum for each candidate .",
    "the second and third gaussians represent candidates that have been mismeasured by the addition of spurious tracking hits or due to hard non - gaussian scatters in the material of the detector .",
    "the first of these has its width determined in the fit to the copious @xmath188 sample while the second is fixed to a large value , 8 ps .",
    "the relative contribution of the two mismeasured signal resolutions is determined using the @xmath188 data sample and fixed for the @xmath184 and @xmath185 samples . according to our simulation ,",
    "the fraction of the second gaussian is about 4% of the well measured signal and the third gaussian is less than 0.1% of the signal .",
    "the probability for a candidate to be signal is determined by its measured mass , and is based on the fit to the mass distributions .",
    "background is considered to have contributions with both zero and non - zero lifetimes .",
    "all parameters that describe the background are allowed to float in the fits except for the width of the widest gaussian which is fixed to 8 ps .",
    "the right - most plots in figures  [ fig : kpimass ] , [ fig : kkmass ] , and [ fig : pipimass ] show the lifetime fits to the three samples and the results are summarized in table  [ tab : lifes ] .",

    "the parameters are those described in the text .",
    "note that we have constrained the candidates to a @xmath0 mass of 1.86514 gev , the monte carlo corrected weighted average of the data .",
    "the signal lifetime is highly dependent on the @xmath0 mass used in the constraint , while the lifetime difference is not .",
    "this technique yields the smallest uncertainty in @xmath54 , but it not optimal for measuring the absolute @xmath0 lifetime and was not used in [ 34 ] . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : lifes ]    note that the background in all the samples has a large component that has a lifetime consistent with the @xmath0 lifetime .",
    "this agrees with the prediction of our simulation that the background with lifetime is dominated by misreconstructed fragments of charm decays .",
    "we calculate @xmath54 separately for the @xmath184 and @xmath185 samples .",
    "systematic uncertainties are dominated by the statistical uncertainty in a monte carlo study used to determine small corrections , consistent with zero , that are applied to the measured result to account for differences between measured and generated values of the lifetimes ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "additional significant systematic uncertainties come from variations in description of the background ( @xmath193 ) , uncertainties in our model of the proper time resolution ( @xmath194 ) , and details of the fit procedure ( @xmath194 ) , where the listed values are the contribution to the average result .",
