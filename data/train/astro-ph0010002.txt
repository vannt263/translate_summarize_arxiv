    "the study of the weak lensing distortion of background galaxies is a powerful tool for measuring the mass distribution of galaxy clusters .",
    "it has long been recognized ( tyson et al .",
    "1984 ) that the tidal field of a cluster acts by slightly modifying the images of distant , background galaxies . by measuring these small distortions the projected mass distribution of the lensing cluster can be derived in a model independent fashion ( kaiser & squires 1993 ) , in contrast with other mass estimators ( x - ray measurements of intra - cluster gas density and temperature , galaxy dynamics ) .    to date",
    ", there are approximately 20 clusters which have been well studied with lensing techniques ( see , e.g. , mellier 1999 for a review ) . in several cases the resulting masses",
    "are claimed to be larger ( by a factor of two ) than those obtained using different methods . at present , it is not known if this discrepancy is due to biases and inaccuracies in the x - ray and dynamical estimates , or to the lensing data reduction method . as a matter of fact , it is not even clear whether there is a real discrepancy ( see wu et al .",
    "1998 ; see also allen 1998 ) . for example , boehringer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown that different mass estimators are in excellent agreement when very good quality x - ray and optical data are used .    in this paper , we study the mass distribution of the cluster ms1008@xmath01@xmath11224 ( in the following , for simplicity , ms1008 ) using high quality imaging data obtained during the science verification of fors1 at the vlt . the depth and seeing quality of these observations in four different bands ( bvri ) , make this dataset ideal for weak lensing mass reconstruction .",
    "the large surface density of background galaxies in these images , as well as the sharpness of the psf and its small variations across the field , significantly improve the accuracy in measuring the distortion field from object ellipticities . as a result",
    ", high signal - to - noise shear maps can be obtained .",
    "this allows us to better investigate the effect of systematics involved in the mass inversion procedure , which in this case exceed statistical errors .",
    "moreover , the availability of radial velocities for @xmath9 galaxies in ms1008 from the cnoc survey ( carlberg et al . 1996 ) , as well as x - ray spectroscopic observations , provide independent estimates of the total mass .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we introduce the basic lensing relations and the notation used throughout the paper .",
    "the observations and the imaging dataset are briefly described in sect .",
    "section  4 is devoted to the weak lensing analysis of the cluster , where we describe in detail the mass reconstruction method and the results obtained . a virial analysis based on the cnoc redshift survey of ms1008 is provided in sect .",
    "a comparison between the light and the mass distribution of ms1008 , and in particular its mass to light ratio , are discussed in sect .",

    "this quantity characterizes the strength of the lens for sources at redshift @xmath17 ; in other words , all the lensing observables for galaxies at redshift @xmath17 depend only on @xmath24 .    in general",
    ", the source galaxies do not lie at a single redshift , @xmath17 , but are distributed with a some distribution @xmath25 ( here we define @xmath25 to be normalized so that @xmath26 ) .",
    "this modifies the mean dimensionless mass density , @xmath27 , as @xmath28 note that the last equality holds because @xmath22 is defined to be infinity for foreground galaxies .",

    "we find @xmath67 km s@xmath68 , thus very close to previous estimates .    in the case of a spherical system and under the assumption that mass follows galaxy distribution , it is possible to show ( e.g. , limber & mathews 1960 ; the & white 1986 ) that @xmath69 here @xmath70 is a term of surface pressure correction , which takes into account the fact that the radial component of the velocity dispersion does not vanish within the observational aperture radius ( carlberg et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the following ,",
    "we assume a @xmath71 correction at the virialization scale , which is typical for nearby and cnoc clusters ( g98 ; carlberg et al .  1996 ) .",
    "the value of the projected virial radius @xmath72 depends on the relative ( projected ) positions of member galaxies within the sampled cluster region .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : mvir ] ) provides a reliable estimate of the virial mass only if galaxy redshifts are available over the whole virialized region of the cluster .",
    "unfortunately this is not the case for ms1008 which is sampled only within about half of the virialized region ( cf.carlberg et al .",
    "while this is not a serious problem for the estimate of @xmath65 , whose profile flattens well within the aperture radius ( borgani et al .",
    "2000 ) , it may represent a limitation for @xmath73 , whose value increases with increasing clustercentric distance .",
    "however , at each radius , an estimate of @xmath72 can be obtained by assuming a shape for the density profile .",

    "1998 ) , we prefer here to show the results for both such profiles .",
    "althouh the two virial mass determinations coincide on scales comparable to the cluster virialized regions , the choice for the density profile affects the mass reconstruction at small radii .    as a remarkable result",
    ", we find an almost perfect concordance between our weak lensing mass and the @xmath77-ray mass by lewis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . * * we stress that the weak lensing profiles shown in fig .  [ fig : mass_vir ] have been calculated by assuming a singular isothermal sphere for the cluster mass distribution ( we recall that this assumption is important when removing the mass - sheet degeneracy ) . as for the comparison with the virial mass reconstruction , a fairly good agreement is found at least for @xmath78 mpc , the virial mass being only slightly larger ( at about 1@xmath46 confidence level ) than that provided by the weak lensing reconstruction .",
    "the difference becomes significant only at smaller radii , where , however , both the virial and the lensing masses become more uncertain .",
    "these results indicate that the weak lensing mass mass reconstruction do provide results which agrees with other methods , based on the assumption of dynamical equilibrium , at least in cases when high - quality imaging data are available for a fairly relaxed cluster , like ms1008 ( see also allen 1998 ) .",

    "we have studied the weak lensing mass distribution of the cluster ms1008 using multicolor imaging data obtained during the science verification of fors1 on the vlt .",
    "the depth , angular resolution , and image quality across the entire field of view make these images a rare and ideal dataset for weak lensing analysis . in addition",

    "we have discussed the impact of systematics in the weak lensing reconstruction of the mass distribution in physical units , which can be summarized as follows .",
    "the removal of the mass - sheet degeneracy is inevitably model - dependent , inducing mass variations of @xmath110 at @xmath111 .",
    "[ note that the estimate of this error is difficult and somewhat arbitrary since the error clearly depend on the `` range '' of possible models allowed . as a result ,",

    "[ fig : mass_vir ] ) . ] by polluting the background galaxy population with a significant fraction of cluster galaxies , the total mass is biased low by @xmath112 .",
    "however , different selections of background galaxies , as well as edge effects due to masked portions of the images , do affect the morphology of the shear maps .",
    "we have not found any evidence for a substructure of the cluster core ; this in part is due to lack of resolution in the mass reconstruction , set by the smoothing scale used .",
    "however , we have found the central region of the cluster to be elongated ns , with some evidence of a displacement of the projected mass peak respect to the cd galaxy , similarly to the x - ray emission .",
    "cosmic variance is expected to affect the assumed redshift distribution of the background field galaxies , and hence the derived cluster mass . from a comparison between the hubble deep field north and south , cosmic variance",

    "* * this can also be taken as a rough estimate of the error due to cosmic variance .",
    "note also the main contribution to this error is from large scale structures rather than from poisson noise in the hdf - n and in our field . in other words , a simple error estimate which assumes that galaxies are uncorrelated would lead to an underestimate of the error .",

    "@xmath116 mpc , lensing and virial mass determinations can be compared .",
    "the virial mass reconstruction at these small radii critically depends on the assumed density profile . using a king - like profile describing the galaxy distribution of local clusters ( g98",
    "also eq .",
    "( [ eq : king ] ) ) , we have obtained a mass which is more than @xmath8 away from the x - ray and weak - lensing mass .",
    "assuming instead a nfw profile , as fitted by carlberg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to cnoc clusters , a much better agreement is obtained over the entire overlapping region .",
    "note that the discrepancy at small radii ( @xmath117 ) between lensing and virial estimate can be explained by recalling that the lensing determination is affected by a gaussian smoothing of @xmath118 , as well as a departure from the weak lensing approximation .",
    "the former effect leads to underestimate the mass in the core , while the latter will generally bias the central mass high .",
    "both effects clearly vanish at large radii .",
    "in addition , we notice that the weak lensing data alone can not discriminate between different mass profiles ( e.g.  nfw versus isothermal model ) .",
    "this analysis shows that the combination of depth and good imaging quality provided by vlt / fors allows us to obtain high @xmath119 mass maps via optimized weak lensing reconstruction methods . on the other hand ,",
    "these data have the virtue of revealing important systematic errors in weak lensing analyses .",
    "we find that the mass - sheet degeneracy dominates the budget of systematic errors and ultimately makes mass measurements via weak lensing model dependent .",
    "the results obtained here are , at a first look , in good agreement with the mass reconstruction performed by athreya et al .",
    "however , a detailed analysis of their study reveals that a different recipe to remove the mass - sheet degeneracy was used .",
    "specifically , they set to zero the mass at large radii ( @xmath120@xmath121 ) .",
    "had they used our ( model - dependent ) method to break the mass - sheet degeneracy , their estimate would have been a factor of two higher .",
    "therefore , there is a discrepancy of the same factor between the two analysis which , at present , we are unable to explain .",

    "in the second analysis of the data , we followed the procedure used by hoekstra et al .",
    "the anisotropic part of the psf is removed on an object - by - object basis by correcting each object s ellipticity via @xmath122 where starred quantities refer to parameters measured for stellar images . in this analysis , we calculated the stellar ellipticities and polarizability employing a matched radius for the gaussian weight function as for the object in question .",
    "we fit a second order polynomial to account for spatial variations in the psf .",
    "we next determine the shear from the anisotropy - corrected galaxy polarizations .",
    "both the ( now effectively isotropic ) psf , and the circular weight function , tend to make objects rounder .",
    "these effects may be corrected for using the ` pre - seeing shear polarizability ' @xmath123 introduced by luppino & kaiser ( 1997 ) , where the @xmath124 subscript again refers to quantities determined from the objects classified as stars .",

    "we reject galaxies with very large , small , or negative values of @xmath128 , and @xmath129 ( the off - diagonal terms typically being very small ) .",
    "the rationale for this cut is that the calculation of the shear and smear polarizabilities for these objects failed , typically either because the objects themselves were very faint and near the detection threshold , or due to the presence of very nearby object contaminating the aperture over which the calculations were performed .    in each @xmath126 bin",

    "<S> this analysis underscores the importance of systematics in the mass determination of clusters , particularly when such a high quality dataset is not available or in similar studies at higher redshifts . </S>"
