    "the julia set of one of them is @xmath1 , while the julia set of the other has no interior .",
    "the latter map appeared independently in  @xcite as a natural skew product map in the study of thurston equivalence of topological polynomials with the post - critical dynamics of @xmath2 .",
    "it is written in affine coordinates as @xmath3    as a development of  @xcite , group theoretic aspects of the map @xmath4 were studied in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the iterated monodromy group of @xmath4 was used to construct an uncountable family of three - generated groups with interesting properties , and later a new group of non - uniform exponential growth was found in this family ( the first examples of groups of non - uniform exponential growth were found in  @xcite ) .    in the current paper",
    "we apply our group theoretic knowledge to description of the julia set of @xmath4 .",
    "we construct a combinatorial model of the julia set in the spirit of hubbard trees .",
    "of course , here the hubbard trees become `` hubbard complexes '' ( actually even complexes of groups ) ; but due to a particular skew product structure of the map , the hubbard complex of @xmath4 is a bundle of `` hubbard tripods '' , and the combinatorial model of the julia set can be described in terms of a `` folding map '' on the bundle of tripods .",
    "the julia set of @xmath4 is represented then as the projective limit of a sequences of three - dimensional hubbard complexes , which are homeomorphic to subsets of the julia set .",
    "a general method of constructing similar combinatorial models of expanding dynamical systems is described in  @xcite .",
    "finding simple and elegant models is still of interest , since construction from  @xcite depends on some choices , which can be made in different ways , leading to models of different complexity .",
    "interesting examples of post - critically finite multi - dimensional maps come from the study of correspondences on the moduli space of a punctured sphere , see  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , an important ingredient of our analysis is missing .",
    "i was not able to prove that @xmath4 is sub - hyperbolic , i.e. , to construct a singular metric on a neighborhood of the julia set of @xmath4 , such that @xmath4 is uniformly expanding with respect to it .",
    "the second section of the paper collects elementary and previously known properties of the function @xmath4 .",
    "we describe its action on the projective plane @xmath1 , the structure of the post - critical set of @xmath4 , recall the results of j.  e. fornss and n.  sibony and discuss the skew product structure of the map .",
    "section `` techniques '' is an overview of the theory of self - similar groups , iterated monodromy groups and their limit spaces .",
    "there are no proofs in it , which can be found either in  @xcite , or in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the general notion of combinatorial models of expanding dynamical systems is described in this section .",
    "more on combinatorial models of hyperbolic dynamical systems , see  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we compute the iterated monodromy group of @xmath4 in section  [ s : imgcomputation ] .",
    "we use an interpretation of the map @xmath4 given in  @xcite , which makes it possible to compute the iterated monodromy group @xmath5 in a relatively easy way .    the combinatorial model of @xmath4",
    "is constructed in section  [ s : polyhedralmodel ] .",
    "it is convenient to pass to an index 2 extension @xmath6 of @xmath5 .",
    "this extension can be defined as the iterated monodromy group of the quotient of the dynamical system @xmath7 by the group of order two generated by the transformation @xmath8 .",
    "the group @xmath6 is generated by a relatively small automaton ( of 12 states ) .",
    "it has appeared for the first time in  @xcite , where it was used to study a cantor set of groups associated with @xmath4 .",
    "we continue the study of the group @xmath6 in section  [ s : polyhedralmodel ] of our paper .",
    "in particular , we describe its nucleus , which happens to be a union of six finite groups .",
    "we use the poset of subgroups of the nucleus to construct a simplicial complex , serving as the first approximation of the limit space of @xmath6 .",
    "this complex consists of three tetrahedra with one common face .",
    "the corresponding approximation of the julia set of @xmath4 is obtained by pasting together two copies of this complex .",
    "we construct the combinatorial model of the julia set ( in subsection  [ ss : iota ] ) ; give an inductive cut - and - paste rule for constructing a sequences of polyhedra approximating the julia set ( theorem  [ th : pastingtn ] and proposition  [ pr : whmnpasting ] ) ; and prove that julia set is the inverse limit of the constructed polyhedra ( theorem  [ th : juliasetmn ] ) .",
    "the cut - and - paste rule works as follows .",
    "the @xmath9th level approximation @xmath10 of the julia set is obtained by pasting together two copies of a complex @xmath11 along their `` boundary '' .",
    "the boundary of @xmath11 is decomposed into a union of 11 regions , which are domains of involutive maps @xmath12 ( `` pasting rules '' ) .",
    "the next complex @xmath13 is obtained by pasting four copies of @xmath11 using five of the maps @xmath12 .",
    "the 11 pieces of the boundary of @xmath13 and the corresponding maps @xmath14 are defined then as unions of the pieces of the boundaries of the copies of @xmath11 according to rules described by the finite automaton generating the group @xmath6 .",
    "the rules are not very complicated , but since the complexes are three dimensional and can not be embedded into @xmath15 without self - intersections , it is hard to visualize them .    in order to understand better the constructed polyhedral model of the julia set , we use the skew product structure of @xmath4 ( and of the model ) , and study it `` fiberwise '' in section  [ s : tripods ] . we show that the fibers of the complexes @xmath10 are trees that can be constructed using natural `` folding '' and `` unfolding '' transformation ( theorem  [ th : fibersrhon ] and proposition  [ pr : fiberinvlim ] ) . as a limit of iterations of the folding and unfolding procedures we get dendrites homeomorphic to the intersections of the julia set of @xmath4 with the lines @xmath16 .",
    "our models are very similar to the usual hubbard trees , since the approximating complexes @xmath10 are homeomorphic to the subsets @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a `` span '' of the post - critical set of @xmath4 inside the julia set of @xmath4 ( proposition  [ pr : mninjulia ] ) .",
    "the last section of our paper contains additional results deduced from the model of the julia set and from properties of the iterated monodromy group of @xmath4 .",
    "we construct a family of length metrics on the slices of the julia set of @xmath4 ; define a family of natural surjections of the slices onto an isosceles right triangle ( this includes , for instance , the sierpiski plane - filling curve as a particular case ) ; describe when the slices are finite trees ; and describe the action of @xmath4 on the manifold of `` external rays '' of the julia set of @xmath4 .",
    "it is shown that the manifold of external rays is an orbispace with the universal covering identified with the real heisenberg group , so that the action of @xmath4 is induced by an expanding automorphism of the heisenberg group .",
    "note that in the classical case of polynomials of degree @xmath19 the space of external rays is @xmath20 with the action of the polynomial induced by the automorphism @xmath21 of @xmath22 .",
    "consider the transformation of @xmath23 @xmath3 it can be extended to a map @xmath24 as @xmath25\\mapsto[(w-2z)^2:(w-2u)^2:w^2].\\ ] ] the jacobian of the map @xmath4 is then @xmath26 hence , the critical locus is the union of the lines @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "their orbits are @xmath30 and @xmath31    consequently , the post - critical set is the union of six lines @xmath32 or , in affine coordinates : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath29 , @xmath36 , and the line at infinity .",
    "the function @xmath4 appeared in  @xcite , where it was used to answer a question of j.  hubbard and a.  duady from  @xcite on combinatorial equivalence of some branched coverings of the plane .",
    "groups associated with it were studied in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "this function is conjugate to the function @xmath37)=[(z-2w)^2:z^2:(z-2t)^2],\\ ] ] considered by j.  e. fornss and n.  sibony in  @xcite .",
    "the conjugating map is @xmath38 where the variables on the left - hand side are from  @xcite , while the variables from the right - hand side are the ones used in our paper .",

    "in fact , some weaker results would be sufficient , but they are probably equivalent to the above conjecture .",
    "it would be very nice to have a general statement about sub - hyperbolicity of post - critically finite endomorphisms of complex projective spaces .",
    "note that the map @xmath4 has a skew product structure : the second coordinate is a rational function depending only on the second coordinate . on the first coordinates of iterations of @xmath4 we get compositions of quadratic polynomials @xmath50 , i.e. , non - autonomous iteration of quadratic polynomials .",
    "the critical point @xmath51 of the polynomial @xmath52 is mapped to @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is equal to the next value @xmath56 of the second coordinate in the iteration of @xmath4 .",

    "namely , the fibers of the projection are mapped by @xmath4 to fibers . in particular , by theorem  [ th : fornsibon ] , the fiber @xmath63 of the projection @xmath64 of the julia set of @xmath4 onto the sphere ( which is the julia set of @xmath56 ) is the julia set of the non - autonomous iteration @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
