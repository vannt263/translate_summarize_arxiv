    "the difference in magnitude is about a factor of 2 - 5 . for fragment ions of the type @xmath26",
    "the recent measurements show larger values than the hydkin curves , where for the dissociation channels with fragment ions @xmath27 and @xmath28 the magnitude of the cross section is significantly smaller . as it has already been mentioned in the case of acetylene",
    ", these deviations would be smaller if no distinction between direct dissociative ionization and fragmentation due to coulomb explosion was possible .",
    "then , the sum of these different processes would be assigned to direct dissociative ionization .",
    "one can therefore conclude that the process of coulomb explosion has a more important role than expected , especially for higher hydrocarbons .",
    "this statement is also confirmed by the numerous processes listed in the previous sections that have been allocated to such processes due to their high energy thresholds .",
    "however , this effect of doubly charged intermediate ions makes the situation more complex concerning the assignment of cross sections to distinct fragmentation channels .",
    "+ as a secondary remark it is noted that as in the case of ethylene , it has been observed that all of the cross sections maxima are shifted to lower energies compared to hydkin cross sections , and indicate therefore again a steeper increase right beyond the threshold .",
    "an ingredient for the assembly of the cross section database hydkin has been the assumption of ( approximately ) energy invariant branching ratios for multichannel processes in the energy region above @xmath0 @xcite.for ( dissociative ) ionization processes going through a dipole allowed transition the energy invariance is based on the born - bethe behaviour of the cross section for large energies . only in those cases when ( dissociative ) ionization proceeds by a different ( non - dipole allowed ) transition , e.g. a coulomb explosion , then the typical @xmath29 behaviour at high energies can not be taken .",
    "an investigation of the energy dependence of the branching ratios based on the recent experimental data could thus illuminate the underlying dissociation mechanisms .",
    "the branching ratios @xmath30 are defined , see ref .",
    "@xcite , to @xmath31 where the j - th ionization channel is indicated by the product ion @xmath32 , @xmath33 denotes the total ionization cross section for the parent molecule @xmath34 , @xmath35 the partial ionization cross section according to the process @xmath36 , and @xmath37 denotes the charge state of the product ion , i.e. here @xmath38 .",
    "obviously , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "as the recent measurements have not been sensitive to distinguish fragmentation channels with respect to neutrals , the specification of the reaction channel with respect to product ions is sufficient . + for acetylene seven distinct reaction channels have been measured and data fits have been generated . dividing these by the total ionization cross section , i.e. the sum of partial ones , seven branching ratios have been determined and compared to appropriate counterparts in hydkin .",
    "it is interesting to note that both , present branching ratios and those obtained from hydkin clearly depart from energy invariance . considering for instance the @xmath41 reaction channels the branching ratios appear to approach constant asymptotic values ( if at all ) only very slowly and far beyond @xmath42 . in other cases , as the dominating @xmath43 channels , the assumption of energy invariant branching ratios appears quite more reasonable , although only within certain limits .",
    "the branching ratio for the @xmath14 yields , however , an absolutely different behaviour compared to the hydkin counterpart , increasing again actually beyond @xmath44 . on balance , the typical energy dependence of branching ratios ( with few exceptions as the parent ion channel ) can be characterized by a sharp increase after the energy threshold , a broad maximum at @xmath45 and a slow decrease afterwards .",
    "+ in order to derive quantitative criteria for an approximation of constant branching ratios to be reasonable , the maximum deviations , @xmath46 , from the mean values of the branching ratios , @xmath47 , have been calculated according to    @xmath48    where @xmath49 indicates again the reaction channel , @xmath50 , @xmath51 for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the latter has been chosen such that all reaction channels are open and considerable beyond the largest energy threshold to ensure a negligible influence of the energy threshold on the energy dependence of the branching ratio . +",
    "the two dominating @xmath55,@xmath56 channels as well as the @xmath28 channel have smaller @xmath46 ( @xmath57 ) , where for the rest of the subdominant channels @xmath58 , with exception of the @xmath14 channel with @xmath59 .",
    "+ for the 13 distinct reaction channels in case of ethylene an analogous analysis of their branching ratios has been made .",
    "the branching ratios have mostly the typical behaviour as described above , with exception of the parent ion and the @xmath60,@xmath55 reaction channels , where in the two latter cases the branching ratio decreases somewhat beyond maximum , but then increases again after reaching a local minimum at @xmath61 . considering the @xmath62,@xmath63 reaction channels , one can again observe the unusual behaviour right beyond the energy threshold , which might be an indication that these cross sections are superpositions of cross sections referring to very different energy thresholds , see sec .",
    "[ ethylene ] + considering the maximum deviations from the mean , @xmath46 , it has been observed that these are lower for the most dominant channels than for less dominant ones : the @xmath64,@xmath55 channels have values of @xmath46 even below @xmath65 ( together with the @xmath66 channel , however , being much smaller in magnitude ) , followed by the @xmath28 , @xmath60 channels with @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "the rest of the maximum deviations are in a range of @xmath69 . separating reaction channels into dominant and subdominant ones",
    ", it appears that the assumption of energy invariant branching ratios would cause less failure ( if the cross sections would be unknown and instead computed by applying scaling laws to known ones ) in case of the dominant ones than in case of the subdominant ones .",
    "this is supported also by the analysis for acetylene , where the ionization is mostly dominated by only two reaction channels , namely the @xmath43 channels , which add up to more than @xmath70 of the total cross section at almost all energies.in view of underlying dissociation mechanisms , one might conclude that the dominating reaction channels are mainly given by dipole allowed transitions , whereas the stronger variation of the branching ratio with energy in case of subdominant reaction channels indicates greater involvement of alternative ( non - dipole allowed ) dissociation mechanisms .",
    "+ also interesting to note is the fact that the recent measurements for ( dissociative ) ionization of ethylene show a different ordering of contributing reaction channels with respect to the magnitude of the appropriate branching ratio compared to the ordering of cross sections given by hydkin . in the latter case",
    "the ordering is as follows , beginning with the largest contributing reaction channel : @xmath64 , @xmath60 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath66 , @xmath28 , @xmath71 , @xmath15 , @xmath72 . instead of this ordering the recent measurements yield the following : @xmath64 , @xmath60 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath28 , @xmath15 , @xmath72 , @xmath71 , @xmath63 , @xmath62 , @xmath73 , @xmath66 , @xmath74 , where it has to be mentioned that the contribution of the @xmath60 channel actually becomes larger than that of the @xmath64 channel for energies beyond @xmath75 as well as the contribution of the @xmath28 channel becomes larger than that of the @xmath56 channel for energies beyond @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the ordering of contributing reaction channels to the total ionization cross section in case of ethylene is different compared to that one based on earlier data compiled by hydkin with respect to the following aspects :    * according to the recent measurements there exist intersections between branching ratios for pairs of processes @xmath64 , @xmath60 and @xmath56 , @xmath28 in contrast to the partial cross section fits provided by hydkin , where the magnitude of the contribution of the @xmath60 and @xmath28 channel to the total cross section is for all energies smaller than the contribution of the @xmath64 and @xmath56 channel , respectively .",
    "in addition are the contributions of the @xmath64 , @xmath60 channels different by a factor of @xmath77 in the case of hydkin , whereas they are approximately equal according to the recent measurements for energies larger than @xmath61 . *",
    "the @xmath66 channel is on the fifth position in the hydkin ordering , whereas it appears next to the last in the present ordering .",
    "a small contribution appears reasonable also because of the molecular structure of ethylene ( @xmath78=@xmath79 ) , because production of a @xmath66 ion gives rise to a rearrangement reaction chain like @xmath80=@xmath81:@xmath82-@xmath83 .",
    "* the ordering of the subdominant @xmath71,@xmath15,@xmath72 channels according to hydkin , is @xmath15 , @xmath72,@xmath71 according to the recent experiments . * for completeness",
    "it is noted that the present ordering includes also the @xmath62,@xmath63 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 reaction channels , which have so far not been available in the hydkin database .",
    "it is also noted that the first three of them are larger than the @xmath66 channel ( see ( b ) ) .",
    "however , the ordering of the three most dominating reaction channels has been untouched below @xmath75 , although their contribution to the total cross section is partitioned in another way .",
    "noting that they add up to almost @xmath70 of the total cross section , the changes of ordering and magnitude of the other channels are just small modifications on the scale of the total cross section .",
    "+ an analogous analysis of the branching ratios for the 11 reaction channels , distinguished by product ions , measured for propene has been made . beside the fact that the determined branching ratios for the @xmath60 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath15 , @xmath72 reaction channels have larger deviations from the mean of branching ratios ( in a range of @xmath84 ) , the six remaining channels ( containing the dominating ones ) have only a rather small deviation , @xmath85 .",
    "a smaller deviation from the mean of branching ratios has been found for the dominating reaction channels in cases of acetylene and ethylene and this holds also for the dominating reaction channels in the case of propene .",
    "+ however , the magnitudes as well as the ordering of the branching ratios differ quite strongly from those obtained from hydkin . whereas the four most dominating reaction channels add up to about @xmath86 of the total cross section , they do just for about half in hydkin .",
    "many of the subdominant channels are therefore much smaller compared to their hydkin counterparts .",
    "the complete ordered set ( beginning with the largest contribution ) of contributing reaction channels given by hydkin @xcite reads : @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath60 , @xmath64 , @xmath55 , @xmath66 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath28 , @xmath94 where the @xmath64 , @xmath55 and the @xmath66 , @xmath91 reaction channels interchange their positions for energies below @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the complete ordered set ( again beginning with the largest contribution ) of contributing reaction channels obtained from the recent measurements reads : @xmath88 , @xmath87 , @xmath90 , @xmath89 , @xmath60 , @xmath92 , @xmath97 , @xmath66 , @xmath28 , @xmath55 , @xmath64 , @xmath15 , @xmath72 , @xmath56 , where the @xmath87 , @xmath90 channels contribute almost equally to the total cross section , the @xmath72 , @xmath56 channels interchange their position for energies above @xmath98 , and the @xmath92 , @xmath97 , @xmath64 channels have been added due to the peaks at @xmath99 thompson , respectively , in the mass spectrum recorded at an electron energy of @xmath100 by feil et al @xcite .",
    "however , there have been reported no cross sections for these values of @xmath101 and their contribution has been estimated to be @xmath102 to the total cross section .",
    "+ comparison of these ordered sets and analysis of magnitudes of the branching ratios yields that the differences in magnitude and ordering of the contributing reaction channels to ionization of propene between present reaction channels and hydkin ones can be summarized in the following :    * the ordering of the @xmath103 ( and most dominating ) channels yields enhanced contribution for odd @xmath104 compared to the hydkin ordering from @xmath105 counting straight down to @xmath106 .",
    "indeed , the contribution of the @xmath88 channel is the largest , quite two times that of the @xmath87 , @xmath90 channels ( whose contribution is almost equal ) and quite four times that of the @xmath89 channel .",
    "together they add up to about @xmath86 of the total ionization cross section of propene .",
    "* there exist @xmath91 , @xmath93 channels in the ordered set of hydkin , which do not seem to have any non - negligible contribution to the total cross section at all according to the recent measurements .",
    "* also the subdominant reaction channels differ as well in magnitude as in ordering .",
    "partial electron impact ionization cross sections have been analyzed for acetylene , ethylene and propene .",
    "data fits are presented in analytic forms according to eq .",
    "( [ fitformula ] ) and have been compared to earlier data compiled by the online cross section database hydkin . + for acetylene , rather good accordance is found in view of the dominating reaction channels , and larger deviations in case of sub dominating channels .",
    "one new cross section fit , i.e. one which has not been included in the database so far , for the @xmath107 channel has been generated .",
    "+ for ethylene , differences between the new cross section fits and the ones stored in hydkin have been rather small in case of dominating reaction channels , and have been larger for sub dominating ones . however , also in the case of dominating channels larger deviations have been observed at low energies ( from threshold to maximum ) reflecting a steeper increase of the cross sections right beyond the treshold .",
    "five completely new cross section fits have been generated , which are those for the ( sub dominating ) @xmath108 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 channels .",
    "+ the largest differences between present and earlier cross section fits have occured in case of propene .",
    "while the parent ion channel does not deviate much from the counterpart in hydkin ( within @xmath109 ) , the @xmath88 and @xmath90 channels yield a totally different behaviour .",
    "while the former is actually the most dominating reaction channel , the latter is almost as large in magnitude as the parent ion channel .",
    "this reflects a totally different ordering of dominating reaction channels in the case of propene , which applies also to the sub dominating channels .",
    "numerous new cross section fits without appropriate counterpart in the hydkin database have been generated , but lack in information of specified fragments .",
    "+ the energy dependence of branching ratios has been investigated , and the ( pre-)assumption of energy invariance has been found to be well based for dominating reaction channels within an accuracy of about @xmath110 , and to be worse based for subdominating channels , where variations of branching ratios up to factors of 6 have been observed . therefore , dipole allowed transitions remain the major underlying mechanisms for dissociative ionization of the three hydrocarbons under consideration , but especially for sub dominating reaction channels alternative non - dipole allowed transitions might have a more significant influence than expected from earlier data",
    ". this might be especially important when constructing cross sections for which no experimental data exists .",
    "however , the pre - assumption of energy invariant branching ratios has proven to be at least sufficient to produce cross sections in the right order of magnitude .",
    "+ on balance , it can be concluded that the differences between present data fits and earlier data summarized in hydkin cross sections may lead only to small modifications of the database , since the differences are rather small on the scale of total ionization cross sections .",
    "how sensitive simulations might be due to such small changes , could be shown by some sensitivity analysis proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for which hydkin also provides the necessary tools .",
    "+ this work shall be concluded with some general remarks .",
    "firstly , the hydkin database as well as the analyzed experiments are based on hydrocarbons consisting of hydrogen , obviously dedicating their relevance to hydrogen plasmas .",
    "it remains questionable if such databases and results are applicable also to hydrocarbons consisting of hydrogen isotopes .",
    "secondly , cross section experiments as well as calculations are done usually for room temperature .",
    "however , it has been shown that at least for the energy threshold of electron - impact ionization there exist both , temperature and isotope effects @xcite .",
    "since the energy threshold plays a crucial role for the energy behaviour of cross sections , also these two effects might lead to further modifications and corrections of the relevant databases for magnetic confinement fusion .",
