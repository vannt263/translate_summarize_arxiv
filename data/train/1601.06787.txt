    "tidal disruption events ( tdes ) occur when a star passes sufficiently close to a supermassive black hole for the tidal fields to destroy ( or severely maim ) the star ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the last @xmath9 years",
    ", significant numbers of tdes have begun to be discovered ( see , e.g. , the reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the first candidates were mostly found as either x - ray or uv flares in archival data ( see the summary in @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , large scale transient surveys like asas - sn ( @xcite ) , ptf ( @xcite ) and pan - starrs ( @xcite ) have found increasing numbers of tdes in real time , allowing more detailed photometric and spectroscopic follow up studies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "demographic studies of tdes have largely focused on the dynamical problem of understanding the rate at which stars can be placed into low angular momentum orbits that will pass sufficiently close to the black hole to be disrupted ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies generally considered only main sequence stars with a common mass and structure , although @xcite discusses the effect of a mass function on the rates , while @xcite and @xcite considered the relative rates for main sequence and evolved stars at a fixed mass but not general populations .",
    "@xcite used an evolving black hole mass function and a model for the observational properties of tdes to estimate rates for a range of observational surveys . @xcite and",
    "@xcite considered a population of main sequence stars mainly following the @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) truncated at @xmath10 to mimic an old stellar population but otherwise ignored star formation histories and stellar evolution .",
    "@xcite focused on absolute rate estimates in various scenarios , while @xcite also examine the distribution of event properties .",
    "broadly speaking , most theoretical studies predict tde rates of order @xmath11  yr@xmath12  gal@xmath12 for @xmath13 , while many observational rate estimates are closer to @xmath14  yr@xmath12  gal@xmath12 ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , however , found a somewhat higher rate in the all - sky automated survey for supernovae ( asas - sn ) .",
    "there are extensive numerical studies of the hydrodynamics of tdes ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and semi - analytic models of their observational properties ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is fair to say that these studies have yet to converge on a predictive model for tde properties .",
    "the fundamental difficulty is that tdes are a three dimensional radiation hydrodynamics problem .",
    "simulations are still challenged by the large range of spatial scales and do not yet include the effects of radiation , while semi - analytic models are not well - suited for transients with necessarily complex spatial structures .    our goal in this paper is to examine the demographics of tdes . given the lack of any reliable predictive model for observables , we focus on a simple , generic model for selection effects that can be observationally calibrated . in our models ,",
    "we include not only an initial mass function for stars , but also star formation histories and complete models of stellar evolution .",
    "we use a mass function for the black holes as well as estimates of its evolution with redshift . in  2 we describe our model for the stellar populations , disruption rates and the black hole mass function . in ",
    "3 we survey the expected demographics of tdes as a function of black hole mass , stellar mass , stellar evolutionary state , and redshift both globally and for a specific observational case .",
    "we will discuss the implications and directions for further inquiry in  4 .",
    "in this section we outline the model we will use for this study . we start with the criteria for disrupting ( or stripping sufficient mass to cause a flare ) a star of mass @xmath15 and radius @xmath16 .",
    "then we introduce a mass function for the stars , star formation histories and a model for stellar evolution .",
    "next we estimate the rates of disruptions for a bulge with velocity dispersion @xmath17  km / s containing a black hole of mass @xmath18 , and discuss black hole mass functions .",
    "finally , we examine several physical properties of disruptions and introduce a simple selection effects model .",
    "we assume that an event occurs when a star approaches closer to the black hole than @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "if the pericentric radius @xmath21 is larger than the schwarzschild radius , @xmath22 , but smaller than @xmath23 , then we assume there is some form of tde .",
    "if it is smaller than the schwarzschild radius , we assume the star falls into the black hole and is absorbed without a luminous transient .",
    "arguably , we might instead use the radius of the last stable orbit . depending on the structure of the star and the exact pericenter ,",
    "the star may be fully destroyed or only stripped of all or part of its envelope ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the mass of the black hole , the detailed limits ( @xmath24 etc . )",
    "depend weakly on the structure of the star ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and the properties of the black hole ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we assume a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) extending from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "this makes the imf a broken power law , @xmath27 with @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "the complete @xcite imf breaks to a still shallower @xmath32 power - law at @xmath33 and extends down to @xmath34 , but we ignore this extension to brown dwarfs .",
    "observational selection effects will disfavor finding such low mass tdes in any case .",
    "the mass function at any given time , @xmath35 , is not the imf , due to the combined effects of stellar evolution and the star formation history .",
    "where stellar mass functions have previously been used in tde rates studies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , they assume an old stellar population by simply truncating the imf at a maximum mass of @xmath10 . while this is a reasonable model for the present day main sequence population of an early type galaxy , it is not a good characterization of the central regions of the milky way .",
    "@xcite , for example , find that the galactic center population is mostly old ( 80% formed 5 - 10  gyr ago ) , but the remainder is in a very young population ( 20% formed in the last @xmath36  gyr ) .",
    "if the typical tde occurs in a galaxy with @xmath37 to @xmath38 , the mixed stellar population we see in the milky way may be more representative than a purely old population .",
    "it is also natural to include broader models of star formation histories since we include stellar evolution and will explore the evolution of tde rates with redshift ,    we considered two basic star formation histories , a 1  gyr burst and continuous star formation , with the star formation rate constant during the star forming period .",
    "we examine the resulting tde rates and properties at ages of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41  gyr .",
    "the two histories are the same at an age of 1  gyr , so there are really 5 distinct cases .",
    "for example , if the life time of a star is @xmath42 , then @xmath43 is the mass function at time @xmath44 for a constant star formation rate and ignoring mass loss .",
    "it follows the imf until the mass where @xmath45 and is then cut off because only star formation in the last @xmath42 contributes to the mass function .",
    "the burst model simply requires more accounting to include the effects of the cutoff in star formation .",
    "we define the mass function so that it is normalized , @xmath46 , and it is useful to define the mean stellar mass @xmath47 and the mean square mass @xmath48    we use the older padua stellar isochrones of @xcite because they include the thermally pulsating agb ( tp - agb ) phase of stellar evolution .",
    "we considered only the solar metallicity models .",
    "the @xcite tracks start at @xmath49 , so we extended them down to @xmath50 by logarithmically extrapolating physical quantities ( luminosity , temperature ) with mass . the exact details are not critical  the primary goal is simply to better estimate the absolute numbers of low mass stars .",
    "we also tracked the population of stellar remnants .",
    "we used the initial - to - final white dwarf mass relation @xmath51 from @xcite for @xmath52 , neutron star masses of @xmath53 from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , and black hole masses of @xmath56 for higher masses .",
    "these choices are broadly consistent with the observed properties of supernova progenitors ( @xcite ) , typical black hole masses ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and estimates of the fraction of core collapses leading to black holes ( @xmath57 , @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed distribution of neutron star and black hole outcomes with stellar mass is an open question ( see @xcite ) , but unimportant here .",
    "we track the evolutionary state of the stars in five bins using the tags supplied by the @xcite isochrones .",
    "we track main sequence stars ( ms , up to the turn off tag to ) , sub - giant stars ( from to to the base of the red giant branch , rgbb ) , red giants ( rgb stars , from rgbb to helium ignition , bheb ) , horizontal branch stars ( hb stars , from helium ignition bheb to core helium exhaustion , eheb ) , asymptotic giant branch stars ( agb , from core helium exhaustion to carbon ignition cb ) , and stars after carbon ignition . in practice",
    ", this latter phase makes a negligible contribution and can simply be ignored .",
    "we will always use the description of the phases as ms , sub - giant , rgb , hb and agb .",
    "the categories are not fully correct for the most massive stars ( and the full sequence of tags is not present ) , but they are appropriate for the intermediate mass stars that dominate the disruption rates of evolved stars . using a power law fit to the main sequence turn off age , we also track the elapsed main sequence lifetime fraction @xmath58 of each star .",
    "we start from the tde rate estimate of @xcite modified to include the effects of a mass function ( see @xcite ) , @xmath59 the disruption rate for an individual star scales as @xmath60 as noted by @xcite . in this expression , we have neglected an additional term of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 for simplicity .",
    "since the @xmath65 dependence on the dimensionless factor setting the disruption boundary from equation  [ eqn : disruption ] is very weak , we simply set @xmath66 .",
    "this rate estimate also neglects any role of stellar collisions in suppressing disruptions of giant stars ( see @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "combine equation  [ eqn : rate ] with the @xmath67-@xmath68 relation @xmath69 to yield a rate scaling as @xmath70 or @xmath71 with black hole mass .    using solar values for all the stellar variables in equations  [ eqn : rate ] and [ eqn : msig ] , the absolute scale of the rate is of the form @xmath72 with @xmath73/year and @xmath74 .",
    "for comparison , @xcite ultimately adopt @xmath75/year and @xmath76 based on numerical fits to their results for individual galaxies .",
    "@xcite , based on similar models of a larger number of galaxies and averaging over a stellar mass function , find @xmath77/year and @xmath78 .",
    "using a completely different approach , @xcite find @xmath79/year and @xmath80 or @xmath81/year and @xmath82 depending on their choice of @xmath67-@xmath68 relations .",
    "there are then further systematic uncertainties coming from the treatment of the angular structure of the stellar core ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and the role of binary black holes ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . as a compromise over these various results",
    ", we adopt a rate model of @xmath83 with @xmath84/year and @xmath85 , where the @xmath86 subscript indicates that the quantity is in solar units .",
    "we also neglect the process of a star `` evolving '' into its loss cone due to its increasing radius as it ascends the giant branch ( @xcite ) since it is sub - dominant ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of changing @xmath87 on our results are trivial , and we will explore the consequences of changing the dependence on the black hole mass ( @xmath88 ) below .",
    "equations  [ eqn : rate ] and [ eqn : rateuse ] depend on the mean stellar mass @xmath47 and the mean square mass @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath89 term represents the change in the rate with the number of stars at fixed total mass .",
    "the rate increases if the mass is divided over larger numbers of stars .",
    "the @xmath48 term is due to the dependence of the orbit diffusion rates on stellar mass  the higher the mean square stellar mass at fixed total mass , the faster the diffusion times , because the gravitational potential is becoming more `` granular '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "if we examine just the @xmath90 factor in equation  [ eqn : rate ] , the inclusion of a mass function ( excluding remnants ) increases the rates by roughly a factor of @xmath91 and depends little on the age or star formation history cases we consider .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite , although they also note that the factor increases significantly for very young ( @xmath92  myr ) stellar populations .",
    "if we include stellar remnants in @xmath48 ( they should not be included in @xmath47 since the remnants make a negligible contribution to disruption rates due to their high densities ) , the rate increase is modestly higher , at a factor of roughly @xmath93 .",
    "@xcite , using theoretical models of the black hole mass function by @xcite , found modestly larger effect , and the differences likely lie in our using a lower , observationally driven , choice for the typical black hole mass . since the effects of remnants in our models",
    "are so small ( 10 - 20% effects ) we neglect them for simplicity .    , defined by the number of black holes per ( base 10 ) logarithmic mass interval from the present ( top ) to @xmath94 ( bottom ) in steps of @xmath95 .",
    "the @xcite ( h07 ) mass function used by @xcite is shown by red dotted lines at @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and the local mass function used by @xcite ( sm16 ) is shown by the red dashed line . ,",
    "width=336 ]    to examine the overall rates of tdes we need the black hole mass function @xmath98 as a function of redshift .",
    "we consider the models of @xcite and @xcite , focusing on the more recent @xcite models .",
    "both models are based on using quasar luminosity functions and estimates of merger rates to model the growth of black holes , constrained by the requirement of matching local estimates of the black hole mass function .",
    "the @xcite , mass function is defined per ( base 10 ) logarithmic mass interval , @xmath99 , over the mass range @xmath100 and the redshift range @xmath101 as shown in figure  [ fig : bhmf ] .",
    "the number of lower mass black holes is divergent ( @xmath102 for low @xmath67 ) , although the total mass in black holes is convergent .",
    "this means that the observed rate of tdes from low mass black holes is controlled by selection effects .",
    "@xcite used the @xcite models and these are very similar , as illustrated by their structure at @xmath96 and @xmath97 in figure  [ fig : bhmf ] .",
    "@xcite used an evolving quasar luminosity function rescaled by a duty cycle estimate , while @xcite start from a local galaxy luminosity function and then populate the galaxies with black holes using the @xcite bulge / black hole mass correlation combined with a bulge mass - dependent black hole occupation fraction . rather than @xmath103 ( stone , private communication ) . ] this mass function , which has a shallower divergence @xmath104 for low black hole masses , is also shown in figure  [ fig : bhmf ] .",
    "as emphasized by @xcite , the degree to which the divergence of the number density for small @xmath67 is real controls the absolute volumetric rate of tdes .",
    "some properties of tdes may depend on the orbital pericentric radius @xmath21 relative to the nominal disruption radius @xmath23 , usually expressed as the ratio @xmath105 .",
    "since we are simply adopting @xmath106 in equation  [ eqn : disruption ] , @xmath107 is restricted to the range @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the point where the star passes through the horizon ( arguably , we could also use the last stable orbit ) .",
    "the distribution of encounters in @xmath107 is non - trivial and can not simply be derived from the @xmath110 scaling of equation  [ eqn : rate ] .",
    "if equation  [ eqn : rate ] really was directly related to the distribution of pericentric radii for disrupting stars , it would imply an unphysical differential distribution of @xmath111 that is dominated by strongly radial orbits .",
    "the same holds for the @xmath112 distribution adopted by @xcite .",
    "tde rates are dominated by two limiting regimes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for more distant orbits , the orbital angular momentum changes relative to the scale needed to pass close to the black hole faster than the orbital time scale . in this `` pinhole '' limit",
    ", the angular momentum for an encounter is random . for closer orbits , the angular momentum changes slowly compared to the orbital time scale . in this `` diffusion '' limit",
    ", an orbit slowly approaches the critical angular momentum needed to reach @xmath23 . in the `` pinhole '' limit , @xmath113 is constant once we include the effects of gravitational focusing , and thus @xmath114 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the diffusion limit ,",
    "all stars disrupt very close to @xmath23 , so @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "following @xcite we model this as @xmath117 where a reasonable match to their estimates of the fraction of `` pinhole '' mergers is @xmath118 low mass black holes have core structures favoring encounters closer than @xmath23 in addition to having large @xmath119 , allowing such encounters while remaining outside the black hole .",
    "the importance of @xmath120 is presently under discussion .",
    "the simplest physical picture of a tde is that the star reaches pericenter intact and then is disrupted with a spread in orbital binding energy set by the tides across the star , @xmath121 with @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) and @xmath124 ( following @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite ( also see @xcite ) found that this was not the case in their numerical simulations and that the spread in energy was essentially independent of @xmath107 , implying @xmath125 .",
    "this was further confirmed by the semi - analytical study of @xcite .",
    "in essence , the star ceases to be bound as it crosses @xmath23 and the debris already proceeding on independent orbits before it approaches pericenter .",
    "the consequence of @xmath125 rather than @xmath124 can be seen in how the energy spread then determines the characteristic fall back time , @xmath126 for a given fall back time , there is a characteristic peak accretion rate of @xmath127 .",
    "compared to the eddington rate , this accretion rate is @xmath128 assuming a radiative efficiency of @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "this is an overestimate of the accretion rate if only ( part of ) the envelope is stripped , as can occur for evolved stars ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is a big difference between the @xmath124 scaling , where close encounters produce short ( @xmath131 ) , high peak accretion rate events ( @xmath132 ) , and @xmath125 , where the time scale and peak accretion rates are independent of @xmath107 .    for surveys ,",
    "the discovery of a tde largely depends on @xmath8 and @xmath133  the rise time must be short enough to trigger a detection , and the peak luminosity must be high enough to allow detection of events in a large enough volume .",
    "overall event durations for tdes are long enough to be unimportant factors for discovery . if @xmath124 , the importance of `` pinhole '' encounters is greatly enhanced .",
    "first , events with long @xmath8 at @xmath134 become short enough to trigger a transient survey .",
    "second , and more importantly , if peak luminosities determine detectability and scale as @xmath135 , then the survey volume scales as @xmath136 .",
    "since @xmath137 , the contribution of events at a given @xmath107 scales as @xmath138 and events with @xmath139 ( modulo the eddington limit ) will dominate the observed rates . in their discussion rather than the differential distribution @xmath114 . ]",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath125 , then the time scales and peak luminosities are independent of @xmath107 and the relative detectability of events with differing @xmath107 must depend on higher order effects than the basic time and accretion rate scales . to avoid considering too many cases",
    ", we will follow @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and assume @xmath125 for our primary discussion in  3 .",
    "we illustrate some consequences of @xmath124 in the appendix .",
    "if we focus on the uv / optical tdes , the observed optical / uv spectra are broadly consistent with black bodies ( @xcite , @xcite ) , although the turn over at short wavelengths is not always observed and it is clear that some tdes with thermal optical / uv properties have significant non - thermal emission components ( @xcite ) .",
    "the general assumption for these events is that the observed emission is reprocessed emission from an underlying accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) rather than direct emission from an accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , although other hypotheses have been advanced ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to the extent this is true and the observed temperature is hot compared to typical survey bands ( e.g. v - band for asas - sn )",
    ", the observed peak luminosity is @xmath140 where @xmath141 is some dimensionless efficiency factor .",
    "this reprocessing model is different from @xcite , where the optical emission is the tail of direct emission from an accretion disk . to the extent that @xmath142 does not vary wildly as a systematic function of parameters ( @xmath67 , @xmath107 , etc . ) , and @xmath143 is eddington limited , then there is a very simple model for the relative survey volumes to be associated with different events .",
    "if an eddington limited event from a @xmath144 black hole would be detected in a local survey out in volume @xmath145 , then any other event would be detected in volume @xmath146 this provides a simple approach to reasonably estimating the differential contributions of events to a survey , while avoiding the very much harder problem of determining @xmath143/@xmath142 and hence the volume @xmath145 in which the fiducial event would be detectable .",
    "more importantly , @xmath145 can simply be estimated empirically from the properties of observed transients , as we will do crudely for the asas - sn survey in  3.3 .",
    "equation  [ eqn : select ] is appropriate for low redshift surveys like asas - sn where cosmology and evolution can be neglected .",
    "other effects may also suppress the observed contributions from lower mass black holes .",
    "for example , @xcite explore a model where only relatively close encounters ( @xmath147 ) circularize the debris rapidly and produce a strong flare , which means that only high @xmath107 pinhole encounters contribute to the tde rate as @xmath67 decreases below @xmath148 .    , per black hole as a function of stellar mass @xmath149 for black hole mass ranges of @xmath150-@xmath151 ( top left ) , @xmath152-@xmath150 ( top right ) , @xmath153-@xmath152 ( lower left ) , @xmath154-@xmath153 ( lower left ) and either 1  gyr burst ( black , solid ) or constant ( red , dashed ) star formation models .",

    "the total rates for the different star formation histories differ by only @xmath57 .",

    "and then , finally , the tdes associated with the highest mass black holes are increasingly due to evolved stars . in the observed distributions , the balance is modestly shifted towards older stars as the fall back time scales become longer and the numerous low mass dwarfs can no longer support eddington - limited accretion . in both the stellar mass and evolutionary state distributions , the differences between the burst and continuous star formation models are relatively subtle , with obvious differences only for high mass black holes where the tde rates are dominated by evolved stars .",

    "if , however , the luminosities are eddington limited , then the visibility of the high @xmath158 events associated with lower mass black holes is greatly reduced , and the sample of observed tdes will be fairly tightly clustered around @xmath235 .    with the simple selection effects model , the expected observed tde rate is roughly @xmath236/year . given our rough estimate of @xmath231  mpc@xmath211 for asas - sn , this implies a tde rate in asas - sn of order 15/year . in practice , asas - sn is finding roughly one tde per year ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "one possibility is that our tde model is overestimating the rate by an order of magnitude , but the distribution in fall back times seen in figure  [ fig : tfb ] suggests an alternate explanation .",
    "the fall back time is largely set by the black hole mass , and spans a range from 10 days or less at @xmath237 up to decades at @xmath164 .",

    "if we required @xmath241  years as a selection limit , we would have only 16% of the potentially observable tdes , leading to a rate of only @xmath242/year in asas - sn that is far more compatible with observed discovery rate .",
    "this is not a panacea since such a cut on the time scales truncates the expected black hole mass distribution at a somewhat lower black hole mass than observed ( compare figures  [ fig : msig ] and [ fig : tfb ] ) . raising the limit on the time scale to @xmath243  years ( 65  days )",

    "presumably , mergers do rapidly refill loss cones , essentially by shifting from orbital evolution driven by relaxation to evolution driven by violent relaxation . a second ,",
    "more likely mechanism , is that the post - starburst phase is also the period when the black holes associated with the mergers are themselves merging .",
    "for example , @xcite find that tde rates can be enhanced by two orders of magnitude in the phases before the system becomes a compact binary , although this phase does not last 1  gyr .    for present purposes ,",
    "we need no detailed knowledge of the mechanism to explore the possible consequences of mergers for the evolution of the rates of tdes . besides the `` reference '' model",
    "we have used here , @xcite considered models with mergers . for merger rates which were relatively high , there was little effect until @xmath271 where growth by accretion begins to slow .",
    "then at lower redshifts , the mergers drove the black hole mass function to be more dominated by high mass black holes , a difference which would tend to reduce the tde rate . in the @xcite models ,",
    "the rate of mergers is independent of black hole mass and proportional to the inverse of the age of the universe , @xmath272 .",
    "this means that the tde rate contributed by mergers approximately evolves as @xmath273 , where we approximate @xmath274 using the fiducial , no merger model of @xcite since the model with mergers was not tabulated .",
    "figure  [ fig : evol2 ] shows how such a contribution to the tde rate would evolve with redshift , normalized to match the reference model at @xmath96 .",
    "the tde rate still drops with redshift , but more slowly because the decrease in the absolute numbers of black holes ( figure  [ fig : bhmf ] ) is partly balanced by the increasing rate of mergers .",
    "as already known , tde rates should be dominated by the disruption of low mass ( @xmath275 ) , main sequence stars by black holes of modest mass , @xmath13 . in detail , the mass function of disrupted lower mass stars is fairly flat because the slope of the stellar mass function is partly balanced by the lower densities of higher mass stars .",
    "some @xmath276 of disrupted stars are high enough mass for the cno cycle to be relevant and have lived long enough ( @xmath277 of their main sequence lifetime ) to show depressed carbon and enhanced nitrogen abundances , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "smaller numbers of older ( @xmath278 ) main sequence stars and subgiants will show significant increases in their average helium abundance . for higher mass black holes , where the lowest mass stars are increasingly absorbed rather than disrupted , the typical mass and age of the disrupted star increases rapidly . above roughly @xmath279 , only evolved stars are disrupted .",
    "the detailed star formation history is not very important except for the the rates associated with @xmath181 or evolved stars and high mass black holes .",
    "the black hole mass function is the crucial factor in determining tde rates because simple models of black hole growth and evolution ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) predict diverging numbers of lower mass black holes just as there are diverging numbers of low mass halos or galaxies .",
    "@xcite explored this in a more empirical model based on simply adding black holes to a galaxy luminosity function and then simply truncating the mass function below some limiting black hole mass . for our black hole mass functions , which extend down to @xmath280 , the disagreement between the model and observed rates ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) is large ( factor of @xmath234 ) .",
    "one possibility , explored by @xcite , is that the black hole mass function is simply truncated below @xmath281 .",
    "a second possibility is that selection effects are strongly affecting the observed rates .",
    "even with a diverging mass function , tdes due to low mass black holes are almost certainly associated with lower peak luminosities and hence smaller survey volumes . with small numbers of known tdes ,",
    "this can quickly lead to discovering no examples of the most common events and hence gross underestimates of the true volumetric rates .",
    "in particular , the observed distribution of optical / uv tde black hole masses is cut off at low black hole masses in agreement with our simple model for survey selection effects .",
    "the model also predicts that the observed sample should be dominated by somewhat higher mass black holes than observed , and this is may be explained by a selection bias against surveys examining slowly rising transients at the centers of galaxies .",
    "combining these selection effects appears to largely , but not perfectly , reconcile the observed and theoretical rates .",
    "searching for tdes with longer time scales in somewhat more massive galaxies is likely to be profitable .",
    "the typical accretion rates associated with tdes are of order @xmath14 to @xmath282  year@xmath12 , very similar to the estimate by @xcite . even without any dramatic evolution in the rates",
    ", this means that the net contribution of tdes to the mean mass of a black holes is @xmath283 to @xmath248 . only for low mass black holes",
    "is this rate high enough to significantly contribute to their growth .",
    "however , the contribution to the growth of the lower mass black holes comes from disrupted stars rather than absorbed stars , and it increasingly appears that most ( all ? ) tdes accrete very little of the available mass ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "if 10% or less of the mass is actually accreted , then the tde process quickly becomes unimportant for the growth of even the lower mass black holes .",
    "these estimates also assume that the total mass of the star is disrupted  for evolved stars with large core / envelope density differences , it is likely that only the envelope is lost ( or portions of the envelope , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the @xcite and @xcite models for the evolution of the black hole mass function , tde rates",
    "are predicted to drop very rapidly with redshift , falling by a factor of @xmath284 by a redshift of unity .",
    "the effect is largest for the lowest mass black holes , in a tde version of `` downsizing '' .",
    "the evolution is so rapid , that it could explain a significant fraction of the factor of @xmath172 nominal rate difference between @xcite at @xmath285 and @xcite at @xmath286 .",
    "although it is also true that the two rate estimates are sufficiently uncertain to be mutually consistent without the rapid redshift evolution . without a well - established model for the behavior of tdes as a function of mass that can be used to model selection effects , it may prove difficult to use tdes to probe the black hole mass function as proposed by @xcite . since the evolution with redshift at fixed black hole mass",
    "is predicted to be so rapid and tde properties at fixed black hole mass are unlikely to evolve rapidly , it should be considerably easier to test models for the evolution of the black hole mass function with redshift using tdes .",
    "for example , the slowly evolving theoretical black hole mass function of @xcite used by @xcite to predict the rates of jetted tdes should be easily distinguishable from the more empirical and rapidly evolving models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while the volumetric rates , which depend on the black hole mass function , show the largest mismatch to observational estimates , there may still be significant discrepancies between predicted and observed rates per galaxy .",
    "any problems have to lie in the rate estimates more than uncertainties in other aspects of the estimates such as the choice of @xmath67-@xmath68 relations .",
    "there is less of an issue if the higher rates found by @xcite , ( as compared to @xcite , for example ) are correct .",
    "there are , for example , fundamental differences between the rate estimates by @xcite or their updates in @xcite and the estimates of @xcite . in the former estimates , the tde rate declines with black hole mass ( @xmath287 to @xmath288 ) , while in the latter estimates , the rate increases with black hole mass ( @xmath289 to @xmath190 ) .",
    "since the range of black hole masses spans 4 - 5  dex or more , such large differences in the mass scaling will have an enormous impact on the mass - dependent rates .",
    "in particular , the rapid rise in the rate with black hole mass found by @xcite greatly suppresses the rate contribution of even a divergent population of low mass black holes .",
    "more broadly , the semi - empirical rate estimates based on the observed structures of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , are essentially all for galaxies containing black holes above @xmath260 .",
    "part of the problem is the difficulty in identifying systems with lower mass black holes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "independent of this problem , present extrapolations of tde rates to lower black hole masses assume an extrapolation of the dynamical structure of the host galaxies to lower mass hosts .",
    "the degree to which this is valid is an open question , as illustrated by the ongoing debates about bulges , pseudo - bulges , and black holes ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , for reviews of some of the issues ) .",
    "detailed models of loss cone dynamics for these lower mass galaxies are required .",
    "if post - starburst galaxies produce a significant fraction of tdes ( @xcite , @xcite ) , then the standard rate estimates are unlikely to be applicable to these systems .",
    "many of the tde properties explored in this paper may be little affected .",
    "at least in the survey of such galaxies by @xcite , the luminosity function of post - starburst galaxies is almost identical in shape to the luminosity function of all galaxies  roughly 1% of galaxies at all luminosities show the strong balmer absorption features characterizing this class of galaxy .",
    "this suggests that the black hole mass function of such galaxies is similar to that of all galaxies , and that just the tde rate is being accelerated .",
    "however , secondary issues ( e.g. mass - dependent black hole merger rates if the rate increase is due to binary black holes ) could then modulate the mass dependence of the rates .",
    "of course , the fundamental tension between the predicted and observed rates is only exacerbated if many of the observed tdes are due to a different mechanism than the standard loss cone mechanism .",
    "on the observational side , the key issue is the extent to which the observed properties of tdes and their hosts are dominated by selection effects .",
    "understanding this requires transient surveys to be sensitive to tdes with ( rise ) time scales of many months to years in order to probe higher black hole masses .",
    "if the suggestion by @xcite that nitrogen rich quasars may be related to tdes is correct , than surveys for spectral evolution in ( particularly the nitrogen rich ) quasars may be an alternate probe for higher mass tdes .",
    "transient surveys are generally sensitive to the much shorter time scales expected for lower mass systems , and may just be limited by reduced survey volumes because lower mass black holes have lower peak luminosity transients .",
    "alternatively , if tde phenomenology ( e.g. , x - ray , uv or optically dominated ) depends strongly on black hole mass , then it will be necessary to unify the results of all the different search strategies used to date .",

    "the range is limited to @xmath294 with the probability distribution of equation  [ eqn : bdist ] .",
