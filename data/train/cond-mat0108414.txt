    "of late years , incommensurate ( ic ) stripe structures have been interesting subjects in various physical phenomena . as the typical examples , we may list an alloy @xmath2 which contains heavy rare earth metals , er , tm,@xcite the incommensurate phase of dielectric material such as @xmath3 and @xmath4,@xcite and the stripe structure in @xmath5 planes of oxide superconductors.@xcite in @xmath2 , the longitudinal incommensurate oscillatory phase appears between the paramagnetic phase and the ordered phase .",
    "the aligned holes ( domain walls ) separate antiferromagnetic stripes in @xmath5 planes of oxide superconductors , then the spin and charge are modulated . in such systems ,",
    "cooperative effects of fluctuation and frustration are considered to play important roles .",
    "thus , we sometimes treat them with the axial next - nearest - neighbor ising ( annni ) model as the simplified theoretical model .",
    "for instance , when a uniaxial anisotropy is strong in the dielectric material , the hamiltonian is equivalent to the annni model if we only consider the dipole interactions up to the next - nearest - neighbor distance .",
    "the phase diagram of @xmath3 obtained by experiments@xcite agrees with that of the three - dimensional annni model obtained by the mean - field approximation.@xcite in copper oxide materials , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the cu - o - cu chains with ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor and antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbor interactions are aligned on two - dimensional planes whose interchain interactions are antiferromagnetic .",
    "furthermore , the spins on this plane are predicted to have a strong ising anisotropy.@xcite consequently , we may treat these copper oxide planes as the two - dimensional annni model , between which the conduction electron planes exist .    in the annni model , there are exchange interactions up to the next - nearest - neighbor pairs along one axis , while there are only the nearest - neighbor interactions along the other axes .",
    "most commonly , we take a convention that the nearest - neighbor interactions are ferromagnetic and the next - nearest - neighbor ones are antiferromagnetic , which cause frustration . when the next - nearest - neighbor interactions ( frustration ) are weak , a ferromagnetic state is the ground state , and a paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition occurs . on the other hand , when frustration is strong , the ground state is the _ antiphase _ state ( abbreviated by @xmath8 ) , which is a commensurate(c ) stripe structure of two up - spins and two down - spins like @xmath9 .",
    "it is widely accepted that the incommensurate stripe phase exists between the paramagnetic phase and the antiphase , and that the successive phase transitions ( paramagnetic - ic - antiphase ) take place ; there is a `` finite '' incommensurate phase where the up - spins and down - spins are aligned with a period longer than two .",
    "although only a topology of the phase diagram is known by the mean - field approximation in the three dimensional model,@xcite estimates for the phase transition temperatures in two dimensions have been done by several approximation theories @xcite and numerical simulations.@xcite however , values of the phase transition temperatures scatter much depending on the methods employed .",
    "one of the reasons that make the estimate difficult is a lack of a reliable numerical simulation . because of frustration",
    ", the correlation time of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations becomes very long near the critical point in large systems .",
    "thus , we are hardly able to reach thermal equilibrium states within reasonable time steps . a powerful method called a cluster heat bath ( chb ) method@xcite was developed to reduce the correlation time , however , the system size accessible by this method is restricted up to about @xmath10 lattice sites .",
    "recently , a new method using a mc simulation has been developed : the non - equilibrium relaxation ( ner ) method.@xcite we are able to understand phase transitions from the differences of behaviors in non - equilibrium relaxation processes , which have been discarded in conventional mc simulations .",
    "since we do not wait until the equilibrium is realized , we can use the cpu time to enlarge the system sizes .",
    "therefore , it makes possible to treat large systems that can not be possible by other methods .",
    "accordingly , there expected to be little finite - size effect in the obtained data , and thus we can regard them as those of the infinite systems . by reasons stated above , the ner method can be effective especially in systems with a slow dynamics which a very long equilibration is necessary .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we study the two - dimensional annni model by the ner method in order to determine the successive phase transition temperatures .",
    "however , the obtained results suggest that the ic phase may disappear within limits of numerical errors .",
    "moreover , we found a very exotic phase transition , which seems to be the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition@xcite if it is observed from the high temperature side , and seems to be the second - order transition if observed from the low temperature side .",
    "this evidence suggests that the frustration parameter does not serve as an asymmetric parameter@xcite which explicitly favors the ic structure .",
    "we describe the model hamiltonian and the ner method in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , and present simulational results in sec .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the two - dimensional annni model is described by the following hamiltonian , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the nearest - neighbor interaction along the chain direction , which is the direction that has no frustration . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the nearest - neighbor and the next - nearest - neighbor interactions along a direction perpendicular to the chain direction ( axial direction that has frustration ) , and @xmath15 . in this paper , we fix @xmath16 for simplicity , and impose the open boundary conditions along the axial ( @xmath17 ) direction , while we use the periodic boundary conditions along the chain ( @xmath18 ) direction .",
    "we define a ratio between the nearest and the next - nearest - neighbor interactions along the axial direction as @xmath19 .",
    "our interest is restricted to the region @xmath20 , where the successive phase transitions ( @xmath21 ) has been considered to occur .",
    "the fermion approximations assumed that the system has straight domain walls along the chain direction at the intermediate temperatures.@xcite that is , domains whose periods are longer than two appear among the commensurate antiphase domains . in this case , the spin structure becomes incommensurate along the axial direction , while the spins along the chain direction order ferromagnetically . on the other hand",
    ", it was postulated that domain walls run along the axial direction in the interface free energy method of @xmath22-hartmann and zittartz(mhz).@xcite namely , the correlation of spins ordered ferromagnetically along the chain direction is destroyed by these domain walls .",
    "sato and matsubara@xcite discussed using the chb simulation that the transition temperature ( @xmath23 ) between the antiphase and the ic phase agrees with that of the free - fermion approximation while the transition temperature ( @xmath24 ) between the ic phase and the paramagnetic phase is close to @xmath23 obtained by mhz .",
    "thus , they considered that the domain walls penetrate into the system along the chain direction at @xmath23 as the temperature increases from the ground state .",
    "the ferromagnetic correlations along the chain direction remain until they are destroyed at @xmath24 and the paramagnetic state is realized .",
    "this idea means that the ic phase exists between the penetration of incommensurate domains in the _ axial _ direction and the disappearance of the ferromagnetic _ chain _ correlation .",
    "therefore , the spin structure along the axial direction is incommensurate , while it is ferromagnetic along the chain direction in the ic phase .",
    "it has been considered that the phase transition between the paramagnetic phase and the ic phase is the kt transition and that between the ic phase and the antiphase is the second - order transition .",
    "we consider following two quantities to clarify the phase transitions .",
    "one is the _ antiphase magnetization _ defined by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the total number of spins in the system , @xmath27 denotes the spin value of the site @xmath28 at time @xmath29 , and @xmath30 represents the antiphase ordered state .",
    "the antiphase magnetization takes a finite value in the antiphase , but vanishes in the ic phase and the paramagnetic phase , since the domain walls destroy the antiphase state at the lower transition temperature , @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , this parameter is employed to estimate @xmath23 .    here",
    ", we should note that the antiphase magnetization is not a relevant order parameter that decays algebraically at the transition temperature .",
    "since the elementary excitation is a domain wall which readily percolates the chain direction , the antiphase magnetization decays exponentially once the domain wall penetrate into the system .",
    "usually , the density of the domain walls has been used as an order parameter .",
    "this parameter is considered to diverge algebraically at the transition temperature as @xmath31 , which is equivalent to that the correlation length diverges algebraically as @xmath32 . in this point , the phase transition between the ic phase and the antiphase is the second - order transition . in the monte carlo simulations ,",
    "the correlation length is related to the characteristic time as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is called the dynamic exponent .",
    "therefore , the characteristic time also diverges at @xmath23 as @xmath35 .",
    "we can extract it from the relaxation of the antiphase magnetization : the time that the antiphase magnetization begins to decay exponentially is the characteristic time that the domain wall penetrates into the system .",
    "we execute the finite - time scaling to obtain the characteristic time at each temperature and estimate @xmath23 as its diverging temperature .",
    "a concrete procedure of the finite - time scaling is explained in sec .",
    "[ sec2_3 ] .",
    "the antiphase magnetization is an extensive variable so that it shows better accuracy as the system size is enlarged because of the self averaging .",
    "thus , we use the antiphase magnetization to estimate the lower transition temperature , @xmath23 .",
    "the other quantity is the _ layer magnetization _ defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the length of the system along the chain and the axial direction , respectively .",
    "the layer magnetization reflects the spin order along the chain direction . in the ic phase ,",
    "the incommensuration is realized in the axial direction .",
    "the spin arrangement along the chain direction should order ferromagnetically or at least be critical .",
    "the free energy of this state , which is of the order of @xmath39 , is always lower than that of the state with the spins disordered only along the chain direction , which is of the order of @xmath40 , if @xmath41 is positive .",
    "accordingly , the layer magnetization vanishes exponentially in the paramagnetic phase , but takes a finite value or behaves in a power law in the ic phase . therefore",
    ", this order parameter is used to estimate the upper transition temperature , @xmath24 .",
    "we determine the transition temperatures by using these two quantities in this paper .",
    "phase transitions occur in the infinite - size limit(@xmath42 ) and in the equilibrium limit(@xmath43 ) .",
    "because we can not take both limits at the same time in the simulation , the equilibrium limit has been taken first conventionally , and then , we take the infinite - size limit by using the finite - size scaling . however , the dynamics of the simulations are very slow in the frustrated systems , which causes a very large correlation time . from a time - space relation ,",
    "@xmath33 , this means that the correlation length is also very large . as will be mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we estimate the correlation length , @xmath44 , for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which resides in the ic phase of previous phase diagram .",
    "in this situation , reliability of the finite - size scaling might become doubtful . in this paper , we follow a completely alternative approach to the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , we observe the relaxation of the infinite - size system to the equilibrium state . in order to extract the equilibrium properties , the finite - time scaling analysis is utilized instead of the conventional finite - size scaling .",
    "this approach is known as the non - equilibrium relaxation ( ner ) method .",
    "@xcite actually , we prepare a very large lattice and observe the relaxation of physical quantities .",
    "the simulations are stopped before the finite - size effect appears .",
    "accordingly we can regard the systems as the infinite systems .    using the ner method",
    ", we can estimate the phase transition temperature and the critical exponents by examining behaviors of the relaxation processes to the thermal equilibrium state ( non - equilibrium relaxation processes ) .",
    "the analysis is based on the dynamic finite - size scaling hypothesis of the free energy that @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the relative temperature , the symmetry breaking field , the system size and time , respectively . @xmath41 and @xmath49 denote static exponents , while @xmath34 is a dynamic exponent , and @xmath50 is a dimension of space.@xcite the order parameter is given by a derivative of the free energy with the field : @xmath51 where we have set @xmath52 at the transition point ( @xmath53 ) because the characteristic time scale @xmath54 and the correlation length @xmath55 should scale as @xmath56 .",
    "equation  ( [ dfss_ord ] ) describes that the order parameter decays in a power law with time at the transition temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the order parameter behaves exponentially at temperatures away from the critical point .",
    "thus , we are able to estimate @xmath57 by this difference .",
    "actually , we measure the order parameter @xmath58 at each mc step @xmath59 started from an ordered spin configuration at a given temperature .",
    "we repeat this mc run by changing the random number seeds , and @xmath58 is averaged over these independent mc runs .",
    "the temperature at which the @xmath58 curve decays in a power law is the transition temperature .",
    "we use the local exponent to ascertain whether the order parameter decays in a power law or exponentially , which is defined by @xmath60 when we plot the local exponent against @xmath61 , it diverges to infinity for @xmath62 , it converges to zero for @xmath63 and to a finite value ( @xmath64 ) at @xmath65 in the limit of @xmath66 .",
    "the upper bound of @xmath57 is the lowest temperature that @xmath67 diverges , and the lower bound is the highest temperature that @xmath67 decays to zero .",
    "the convergent value of the local exponent at @xmath65 is the critical exponent @xmath68 from eq .",
    "( [ dfss_ord ] ) .      here",
    ", we describe the ner of fluctuation . @xcite the susceptibility is written by differentiating eq .",
    "( [ dfss_free ] ) with the symmetry breaking field twice , @xmath69 where we have used the scaling relations : @xmath70 the susceptibility diverges in a power law at the transition temperature .",
    "thus , we are able to estimate the transition temperature and the critical exponents from the susceptibility .",
    "it is also noticed that the ner of fluctuation does not require us to start with a symmetry - broken ordered state .",
    "the quantity of fluctuation always takes a definite value and diverges at @xmath57 even though the symmetry is not spontaneously broken .",

    "this is especially useful when an ordered state is not known yet , or it is difficult to realize . the layer magnetization defined by eq .",
    "( [ layer_mag ] ) is equivalent to the second derivative with respect to a local field along a single chain in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "when the simulation starts from the antiphase , the first derivative term remains finite in the ner process even though the temperature is in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "therefore , the layer magnetization is not regarded as the susceptibility .",
    "the ner of the layer magnetization is within a scheme of the ner of fluctuation , only when the simulation is started from the paramagnetic state .      in case when the ner function does not begin to decay algebraically within a reasonable time , it is difficult or almost impossible to estimate the transition temperature directly by the local exponent .",
    "even in such a situation , we are able to determine it by using the finite - time scaling analysis , which is a direct interpretation of the finite-``size '' scaling by a relation @xmath56 .",
    "we present the finite - time scaling relation @xcite as follows , @xmath71 where @xmath68 , and @xmath72 denotes a relaxation time at the relative temperature @xmath73 . since the relaxation time diverges algebraically in the case of the second - order phase transitions , the relation between the relaxation time and the relative temperature is described by @xmath74 on the other hand , in the case of the kt transition,@xcite it is considered that the relaxation time diverges exponentially , which we assume that @xmath75    now , we describe how we actually estimate the transition temperature by using eq .",

    "this temperature belongs to the ic phase ( kt phase ) in previous investigations as summarized in table  [ tc_comparison ] .",
    "when the system size is small ( @xmath88 ) , the relaxation roughly looks like a power - law decay , which misled us to the kt phase .",

    "the frustration parameter , @xmath151 , of the annni model has been considered as the asymmetric parameter based on the approximate theory @xcite valid only at low temperatures , and the small - scaled monte carlo simulations.@xcite however , what is actually favored by frustration is the creation of the domain wall . between the creation of the domain wall and the realization of the ic structure ,",
    "there are many conditions to satisfy , which have been supposed in the free - fermion approximation.@xcite one of these is the spin correlation along the ferromagnetic chain . in the two - dimensional annni model ,",
    "the non - frustrated direction is only one dimension , and thus the spin correlation along the ferromagnetic chain can be easily destroyed .",
    "therefore , we question regarding the frustration parameter as the asymmetric parameter .",
    "if we consider that these two are not related with each other and the asymmetric parameter is zero in the present model , the width of the ic phase becomes infinitesimal .",
    "this is what we observed in this paper .    here",
    ", we show the comparison of the obtained transition temperatures with the previous ones in table  [ tc_comparison ] . it is recognized that our @xmath24 is lower than any other ones , though @xmath23 is consistent with each other .",
    "this can be explained by the difference of the finite - size effect .",
    "the phase transition between the ic phase and the paramagnetic phase is confirmed to be the kt transition while the one between the antiphase and the ic phase is the second - order .",
    "the correlation length diverges algebraically against the temperature in the latter , while it diverges exponentially in the former case .",
    "if a system size is small compared with the correlation length and the accuracy of the numerical data is not enough , even the finite - size scaling analysis may mislead to a wrong @xmath57 , where the finite but very large correlation length reaches the finite system size .",
    "therefore , it is very likely that the kt transition temperature obtained previously is over - estimated . we may rather easily obtain the phase transition temperature accurately in the second - order transition , because the divergence is algebraically .",
    "in the two - dimensional annni model , the correlation length along the chain direction is @xmath90 at @xmath46 and @xmath45 which is the temperature a little higher than the kt transition temperature and the correlation length is far larger than the system sizes ever simulated previously ( @xmath152).@xcite we actually used data with system sizes , @xmath153 in this paper , and checked the finite - size effect and the range of observing time in which the system behaves as an infinite system at each temperature . thus , our data can be considered as closed to the thermodynamic value .",
    "this is a reason why we could detect the kt transition accurately .    in this paper",
    ", we have supposed that the ferromagnetic correlation along the chain direction remains finite or at least it is critical in the ic phase .",
    "thus , the @xmath24 we have obtained is the temperature at which the ferromagnetic correlation becomes critical . above this temperature , each ferromagnetic chain exhibits paramagnetism , even though the correlation length is very large near the @xmath24 .",
    "the present results only exclude the finite ic phase of this type . in this study",
    ", it is clarified that the domain walls penetrate into the system along the chain direction at the lower transition temperature , @xmath23 .",
    "the spin configuration along the chain direction changes drastically from the ferromagnetic ordered state to the paramagnetic disordered state at the same temperature within limits of error .",
    "we can neglect the ic phase where the ferromagnetic correlation has been expected to be critical .",
    "therefore , the domain walls mostly run straight along the chain direction .",
    "we consider this is why the naive free - fermion approximation of villain and bak@xcite gives the best quantitative agreements with our estimate of @xmath23 , and is the best approximation .",
    "the analyses for other regions of @xmath151 and determination of the critical exponents will be a task in the future . the ner of the binder parameter , the specific heat and the spin correlation with high accuracy is necessary.@xcite    as for the dielectrics , @xmath154 , the phase diagram@xcite in the low concentration of ti is very similar to that of the annni model if we interpret the paraelectric , the ferroelectric and the antiferroelectric phases as the paramagnetic , the ferromagnetic and the antiphase phases .",
    "there are two controversial explanations for the existence of the incommensurate phase observed in the experiment .",
    "et al_.@xcite concluded that the appearance of the ic phase is due to the surface effect by two experiments using the powder neutron diffraction and a transmission electron microscope . on the other hand , viehland _",
    "et al_.@xcite considered it a bulk effect by directly observing the high resolution image of a transmission electron microscope .",
    "in addition watanabe _",
    "et al_.@xcite also described that it is not because of the surface effect by examining the stability of the ic phase in the bulk .",
    "if this compound can be explained by the annni model , the existence of the ic phase is only possible in three dimensions .",
    "therefore , we predict that the appearance of the ic phase in @xmath3 is the effect of a bulk .    in this work ,",
    "we have presented that the ner analysis is very effective for systems with the kt transition and/or with slow - dynamics which has been difficult by numerical methods .",
    "furthermore , a phase transition is studied using the finite - time scaling if we know a proper quantity that can probe characteristic time , @xmath54 , or a characteristic length , @xmath55 , even though it is not a relevant order parameter .",
    "it is considered that images of the phase transition which has been believed as standard may change in some systems .",
