    "mrk 501 and mrk 421 have been well detected as extra - galactic tev @xmath0-ray sources by whipple and subsequent ground - based cerenkov detectors ( @xcite ) .",
    "they are the so - called bl lac objects , which are radio - loud agns ( active galactic nuclei ) whose relativistic jets are aligned along our line of sight .",
    "flux variability on various scales is a common feature of bl lac objects as already seen in mrk 501 and mrk 421 , and spectral variations of @xmath0-rays coming from these sources are considered to be a very powerful tool for understanding the physics of bl lac objects .",
    "when mrk 501 was first detected by the whipple collaboration in 1995 ( @xcite ) , it showed rather low fluxes at a level significantly below the crab flux . in march of 1997 , however , this source went into a state of remarkably flaring activity and its high state lasted for almost half a year with highly variable and strong @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "the maximum flux reached roughly 10 times that of the crab . during this period , several groups ( @xcite ) observed strong @xmath0-ray emission from this source with imaging atmospheric cerenkov detectors .",
    "independent measurements of the @xmath0-ray spectrum seem to show a gradual softening towards higher energy , while the systematic uncertainties in the flux estimates remain too large to reach a common understanding .",
    "the energy spectrum and its shape are very important quantities for clarifying the mechanism of @xmath0-ray production or particle acceleration at the source , and eventually to lead to the actual measurement of the intergalactic infrared or far - infrared background field ( @xcite ) . hence , confirmation of the detection of @xmath0-rays with a different technique will be strongly required .",
    "the tibet air shower array , operating since 1990 , is located at yangbajing ( 4300 m above sea level ) in tibet ( @xcite ) .",
    "this array has a capability of detecting @xmath0-rays in the tev energy region with high efficiency and good angular resolution . using this array ,",
    "we have succeeded in detecting the crab at the 5.5  @xmath1 level ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we present the observation of multi - tev @xmath0-ray flares from mrk 501 in 1997 .",
    "the result obtained with well established air shower technique is important for comparing with those by imaging atmospheric cerenkov telescopes .",
    "the tibet air shower array consists of two overlapping arrays ( tibet - ii and hd ) as described elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "the tibet - ii array comprises 185 scintillation detectors ( bicron 408a ) of 0.5 m@xmath2 each placed on a 15 m square grid with an enclosed area of 36,900 m@xmath2 , and the hd ( high density ) array is operating inside the tibet - ii array to detect cosmic ray showers with energies lower than 10 tev .",
    "this hd array consists of 109 scintillation detectors ( some of detectors are commonly used in both arrays ) , placed on a 7.5 m square grid covering an area of 5,175 m@xmath2 .",
    "the detector arrangement of the tibet air shower array is schematically shown in fig .",
    "every detector , except those placed with a 30 m spacing on the outskirts of the inner detector matrix of the tibet - ii array , is equipped with a fast timing ( ft ) phototube ( hpk h1161 ) and is thus referred to as an `` ft - detector  . a lead plate of 5 mm thickness is placed on the top of each detector to improve the fast timing data by converting @xmath0-rays in the showers to electron pairs .",
    "this lead converter typically increases the shower size by a factor of about 2 and improves the angular resolution by about 30 % ( @xcite ) .",
    "all the tdcs ( time - to - digital converters ) and adcs ( analog - to - digital converters ) are regularly monitored by using a calibration module in the fastbus system at every 20 minutes .",
    "the length of each signal cable is also monitored by measuring a mismatched - reflection pulse from each detector .",
    "the data - taking system has been operating under any 4-fold coincidence in the ft - detectors , resulting in that the trigger rate of the events is about 200  hz for the tibet - ii while being about 115  hz for the hd array .",
    "the observation presented here was made by using the data taken between 1997 february and 1997 august .",
    "the event selection was done by imposing the following three conditions to the recorded data : 1 ) each of any four ft detectors should record a signal of more than 1.25 particles ; 2 ) among the four detectors recording the highest particles , two or more should be within each detector area of the tibet ii and hd arrays denoted by the dotted and solid lines , respectively , in fig.1 ; and 3 ) the zenith angle of the incident direction should be less than 45@xmath3 . after data processing and quality cuts , the total number of events selected were @xmath4 for the hd array and @xmath5 for the tibet - ii array , respectively , with the effective running time of 155.3 days .",
    "since the background cosmic rays are isotropic and @xmath0-rays from a source are apparently centered on the source direction , a bin size for collecting on - source data should be determined based on the array s angular resolution so as to optimize the signal to noise ratio . in order to achieve a good resolution , a study of core - finding techniques and shower - front curvature corrections has been done ( @xcite ) .",
    "the angular accuracy of the tibet array can be checked thoroughly by observing the shadow that the moon casts in the cosmic rays ( @xcite ) .",
    "the tibet ii and hd arrays have a capability of observing the moon s shadow with good statistics .",
    "the mode energies of primary protons to be detected are about 3 tev and about 8 tev for the tibet hd and ii arrays , respectively .",
    "hence the angular resolution of each array can be independently examined in respective energy regions .",
    "the statistical significance of the moon s shadow observed with both arrays becomes about 10@xmath1 or more for half a year observation . from this observation , we estimated the angular resolution of both arrays to be better than 0.9@xmath3 for all events .",
    "we have also found that the angular resolution scales with @xmath6 , where @xmath6 stands for the sum of the number of shower particles per m@xmath2 detected in each counter .",
    "the resolution increases with increasing @xmath7 as @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the moon s shadow by the events with @xmath7 = 15 - 50 was found at the position shifted from the moon center to the west by 0.32@xmath3 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the primary cosmic rays casting the moon s shadow are almost protons and the mean energy of protons capable of generating these events at yangbajing is estimated to be about 4.7 tev by the simulation . on the other hand , a proton of energy e impinging at normal angle on the earth is deflected by the geomagnetic field and its deflection angle is calculated as @xmath11 tev .",
    "so , the observed shift of the moon s shadow is consistent with that expected from the effect of the geomagnetic field .",
    "a more elaborate study of the moon s shadow using a monte carlo technique shows almost same results as those by the experiment ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the results obtained by assigning primary energies to the observed events can be directly checked by observing the moon s shadow .",
    "the pointing of the array is inferred from the position of the moon s shadow by high energy cosmic rays ( @xmath12 tev ) which are negligibly affected by the geomagnetic field .",
    "this estimation can also be done by examining the deviations of the moon s shadow in the north - south direction , since the effect of the geomagnetic field acts only in the east - west direction .",
    "it is then found to be smaller than 0.1@xmath3 for both arrays .",
    "figure 2 shows the cumulative deficit counts of the events coming from the direction of the moon as a function of mjd , obtained with the hd array .",
    "the data set used are between february 1997 and august 1997 , just corresponding to the observation period of mrk 501 .",
    "a linearly increasing of the deficit events may be a sure guarantee against the long - term stability of the array operation .",
    "th meridian zenith angle of the moon at yangbajing changes between 12@xmath3 and 50@xmath3 every 27.3 days .",
    "naturally the most efficient observations are done when the moon comes in sight around the smallest zenith angle of about 12@xmath3 every 27.3 days .",
    "this effect will be found as a tier - like structure on the deficit curve , as seen in fig .",
    "a circular window was used to search for signals and then its size was determined based on the angular resolution estimated by the experiment .",
    "the window size is chosen to optimize the significance of signals defined by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of signals and @xmath15 the number of background events , and to contain more than 50  % of the signals from a source .",
    "the radii of search windows used for the events with @xmath16 15 , 50 and 100 were 0.9@xmath3 , 0.8@xmath3 and 0.5@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the signals were searched for by counting the number of events coming from the on - source window .",
    "the background was estimated by averaging over events falling in the ten off - source windows adjacent to the source , but without overlapping each other .",
    "the source window traverses a path in local coordinates expressed by the zenith angle and azimuth angle through every day . in order to reduce a strong zenith angle dependence of the background",
    ", these off - source windows were taken in the azimuth angle directions with the same zenith angle , except two windows adjacent to the on - source window .",
    "figure 3 shows the cumulative excess counts for all events as a function of mjd and background , obtained with the hd array .",
    "no excess counts were observed until the middle of march 1997 .",
    "however , excess events rapidly increased in the period from april through june and then it became slightly dull .",
    "the operation of the array was stopped on august 25 of 1997 to calibrate the operation system .",
    "as discussed in  3 , one should first note that the observed excess counts are by no means due to some artificial noise or unstable operation of the system .",
    "the statistical significance of the excess counts reached a 3.7  @xmath1 level during this period .",
    "the excess counts very rapidly increased during the period from april 7 through june 16 and the statistical significance of the excess counts was a 4.7  @xmath1 .",
    "these observed features are almost consistent with other observations by atmospheric cerenkov telescopes ( @xcite ) .    shown in fig .",
    "4 is the contour map of the excess event densities around mrk 501 for the events with @xmath16 15 observed between april 7 and june 16 in 1997 .",
    "this map was obtained using the same method as done for the moon and sun shadows ( @xcite ) .",
    "mrk 501 is well observed in the right direction by our air shower array .",
    "figure 5 shows the distribution of the opening angles relative to the mrk 501 direction for all events with @xmath16 15 in the hd array .",
    "the excess in the small opening angle region ( less than 0.5@xmath3 ) could be attributed to @xmath0-rays from mrk 501 .",
    "the simulation result done for @xmath0-ray events coming from mrk 501 can well reproduce the experiment as shown in fig .  5 , when we take account of the systematic pointing errors estimated in  3 . for the observation period from 1997 february to 1997",
    "august , the statistical significances of the excess events with @xmath16 15 , 30 and 50 were 3.7  @xmath1 , 2.3  @xmath1 and 1.6  @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we also searched for @xmath0-ray emission using the entire tibet - ii array , but no excess was found in this period and upper limits on the excess number of the events at the 90 % confidence level were obtained .",
    "we estimated the @xmath0-ray spectrum from mrk 501 by a monte carlo simulation ( we used a genas code by kasahara & torii ( @xcite ) . ) , assuming a differential power - law spectrum with the form @xmath17 and the cut - off at a certain energy , @xmath18 , where the cut - off means that the spectral slope steepens by 1.0 at @xmath18 .",
    "the value of @xmath19 was changed between 2.4 and 2.7 and also the effect of @xmath18 was examined between 7 tev and 30 tev .",
    "primary @xmath0-rays with energies between 0.2 tev and 50 tev were thrown from the direction of mrk 501 .",
    "observation of simulated events at yangbajing level was done as in our experiment , estimating the collecting area , trigger efficiency and threshold energy for @xmath0-rays generating the events at observation level .",
    "simulated events in respective size ( @xmath7 ) bins were then compared with those by the experiment .",
    "the energy of @xmath0-rays was defined as the energy of the maximum flux of simulated events observed in each size bin .",
    "these steps were repeated until the observed results are well reproduced .",
    "a combination of @xmath20 and @xmath21 20 - 30 tev can reproduce the data well .",
    "we examined that the absolute flux values except the highest energy bin stay almost unchanged for above trials , but it is of course difficult to settle the spectral slope from this experiment because of very small energy range fitted here .",
    "the systematic errors on the flux arise mainly from the event selection procedure , which depends upon the array performance , and from the calculations of the collecting area and the air shower size distribution by the simulation .",
    "they are estimated to be 13 % and 8 % , respectively ( @xcite ) .    shown in figs .",
    "6 and 7 are the energy spectra averaged in the period from february 15 to august 25 in 1997 and from february 15 to june 8 in 1997 , respectively .",
    "the latter observation time corresponds to that of the whipple collaboration ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is seen that the results reported recently by other experiments ( @xcite ; @xcite & @xcite ) are almost compatible with ours , although these do not cover the same observation times .",
    "it should pay attention , however , that our results were obtained by the continuous observation of mrk 501 extending february through august in 1997 , while those by cerenkov telescopes were obtained for very limited periods of moonless and cloudless nights .",
    "mrk 501 and mrk 421 , nearby agns , are at almost the same red - shift ( 0.033 and 0.031 , respectively ) and have been detected in tev energies ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , mrk 501 during the strong , long - lasting 1997 flare provided a good opportunity to study the energy spectrum of @xmath0-rays from this source in detail ( @xcite ) , suggesting a spectral feature different with that of mrk 421 ( @xcite ) . in both sources ,",
    "it is likely that a synchrotron - inverse compton picture plays an important part ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the attenuation mechanism of tev @xmath0-rays by intergalactic infra - red photon field is almost the same for both sources , a difference of spectral features , if any , could be attributed to the production mechanism of @xmath0-rays at the sources .",
    "therefore , it is very important to continue the observation of high energy @xmath0-rays from both sources with as small uncertainties as possible .",
    "mrk 501 suddenly came into a very active phase from march in 1997 , with several large flares and lasted for @xmath22 yr .",
    "the maximum @xmath0-ray flux during this period reached about 10 times as high as the crab nebula . following a successful observation of steady emission of multi - tev @xmath0-rays from the crab(@xcite ) , we further detected multi - tev @xmath0-rays from mrk 501 which was in a high flaring state between march 1997 and august 1997 , and estimated the absolute fluxes of @xmath0-rays around multi - tev region , using the high resolution tibet air shower array .",
    "the detection of a signal from this source was achieved by the improvement of the array performance , which can be directly checked by observing the moon s shadow .",
    "monthly observations of the moon s shadow provide a direct check of the angular resolution , pointing accuracy , and also the stable operation of the array over a long period .",
    "furthermore , the observation of the displacement of the moon s shadow due the effect of the geomagnetic field provides an important check of the results obtained by assigning energies to all the events .",
    "this is the first attempt to be done in the air shower experiments , and it suggests that the moon is a unique cosmic - ray anti - source capable of calibrating the array performance thoroughly .",
    "hence , the results obtained by the tibet experiment using a different technique will be a great help to understand the possible bias and errors involved in the cerenkov observations .",
    "the area of the present hd array will be extended by a factor of about five in 1999 , while its effective area will be increased by a factor of about seven by the reduction of edge effects .",
    "then , the tibet array could cover the energy range from 3  tev to @xmath23100  tev with significantly better statistics and angular resolution at high energies .",
    "air shower arrays are wide aperture and high duty cycle instruments , in contrast to atmospheric cerenkov telescopes with relatively narrow fields of view and small duty cycle of @xmath2310 % .",
    "these features will be indispensable for understanding a time variability of emission of high energy @xmath0-rays from point sources such as agns and grbs ( gamma ray bursts ) .",
    "the tibet experiment , therefore , will have unique capabilities for the discovery of new , relatively bright sources and for a general survey of the overhead sky .",
