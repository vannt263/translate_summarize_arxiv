    "the problem of enumeration of knots and links has always interested knot theorists . in this paper",
    "we introduce a method of enumerating link projections by first decomposing them into pieces called _ atoroidal graphs_. we define surgery on these atoroidal graphs and show how they can be enumerated by performing surgery on a well known family of link projections . by recomposing these atoroidal graphs we can thus enumerate link projections .",
    "i have included an enumeration of atoroidal graphs to 12 crossings .    a link projection is given by a 4-valent planar graph @xmath0 . to form a link we can replace each vertex of @xmath0 by a crossing . to enumerate links in this way we must first enumerate link projections .",
    "it was kirkman s success in enumerating link projections or _ polyhedra _ as he called them(@xcite,@xcite ) that formed the basis of the knot tables of both tait(@xcite ) and little(@xcite,@xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "conway introduced a notation which made it possible for him to enumerate knots to 11 crossings and links to 10 crossings in a single afternoon where before it had taken years . in his paper conway defined a _",
    "basic polyhedron _ to be a polyhedron with no bigon regions and showed that every link is obtained by replacing each vertex of a basic polyhedron by a rational tangle .",
    "these basic polyhedra are closely related to the atoroidal graphs defined in this paper and can be enumerated using the enumeration of atoroidal graphs described .",
    "the decomposition of a link projection into atoroidal graphs is achieved by cutting the projection along certain non - trivial curves .",
    "we then define surgery on an atoroidal graph giving a new atoroidal graph with one more vertex .",
    "this gives a partial ordering on atoroidal graphs where @xmath1 if a surgery on @xmath2 results in @xmath3 and we show that a graph is initial if and only if it has no vertices of a given type . using this we can list the initial objects and thus enumerate all atoroidal graphs by repeatedly performing surgery on these initial objects .",
    "the motivation for the paper comes from orbifold theory and hyperbolic geometry but a background in these is not necessary here . for a reference see @xcite . for readers interested ,",
    "these aspects are laid out in the section on orbifolds .",
