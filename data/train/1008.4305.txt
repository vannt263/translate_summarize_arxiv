    "protoplanetary disks are crucial objects in low - mass star formation , possessing three vital functions : they ( i ) aid the dissipation of angular momentum away from the young stellar system , ( ii ) allow the efficient accretion of matter onto the young star and ( iii ) contain all material , dust and gas , which may end up in a planetary system orbiting the main - sequence star .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the chemistry and molecular composition of a protoplanetary disk surrounding a young star which will evolve into a main - sequence star resembling our sun . at the low temperatures encountered in many astrophysical regions ( @xmath0  10  k to @xmath0  100  k ) , molecules are readily excited into higher rotational energy states and",
    "subsequently emit radiation at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths .",
    "early observations of t tauri stars at these wavelengths revealed the presence of molecular material in a flattened disk - like structure ( e.g.  @xcite ) and in keplerian rotation about the parent star ( e.g.  @xcite ) . since then",
    ", molecular rotational line emission originating from a disk has been observed in several t tauri systems including tw hydrae @xcite , dm tauri @xcite and lkca 15 @xcite .",
    "most species detected are small simple molecules , molecular ions and radicals such as co , hco@xmath5 , cn , hcn , cs , c@xmath1h and n@xmath1h@xmath5 , along with several associated isotopologues ( e.g.  @xmath6co , c@xmath7o , dco@xmath5 , h@xmath6cn , h@xmath1d@xmath5 and c@xmath8s ) .",
    "the most complex species observed to date is the small organic molecule , formaldehyde , h@xmath1co @xcite with methanol , ch@xmath2oh , thus far eluding detection ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite report a detection of deuterated water , hdo , in the disk of dm tau , although this result has since been disputed by @xcite .",
    "infra - red emission has also been observed originating from disks embedded in young stellar objects and arising from vibrational transitions in gas - phase molecules capable of survival in the warmest regions ( @xmath9  350  k ) .",
    "thus , infra - red emission probes not only a different physical region of the disk to that probed by ( sub)mm emission , but also uses different molecules as tracers , hence providing complimentary chemical information .",
    "the molecules detected thus far at infra - red wavelengths are co , hcn , oh , h@xmath1o , co@xmath1 and c@xmath1h@xmath1 @xcite with an upper limit determined for ch@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "observations of molecular line emission from disks , to date , have been hampered by the small angular size of these objects on the sky and the limitations of existing facilities , explaining why the species detected are those which are abundant and possess relatively simple rotational energy spectra ( e.g.  co ) .",
    "single - dish facilities which operate at ( sub)mm wavelengths such as the 15  m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) in hawaii and the iram  30  m telescope in spain , have been predominantly used in the detections of the molecular species in the t tauri systems listed . with",
    "beam - sizes much larger than the typical source size , usually a single molecular line profile is generated characterising emission from the entire disk . in order to spatially",
    "resolve the emission and hence trace the radial and vertical physical and chemical structure , interferometry must be employed and indeed , @xcite report spatially resolved emission arising from molecular rotational transitions in the disk of tw hya using the sub - millimeter array ( sma ) .    the discipline of ( sub)mm astronomy is scheduled for a revolutionary transformation with the first light of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) in chile expected in 2012 ( see http://www.almaobservatory.org ) .",
    "alma , with its 50 12  m telescopes and fully variable configuration , will have the spatial resolution necessary to observe molecular line emission from protoplanetary disks on sub - milli - arcsecond scales and enable the tracing of the molecular content of disks to within @xmath11  0.1  au of the parent star at its highest operational frequencies .",
    "it is anticipated that the sensitivity and high spectral resolution of alma will lead to the potentially overwhelming detection of many further molecular species , including complex organic molecules considered the building blocks of life , in many astrophysical sources including protoplanetary disks .    motivated by the impending completion of alma",
    ", we have constructed a high resolution combined chemical and physical model of a protoplanetary disk surrounding a typical t tauri star using as comprehensive a chemical network as computationally possible . in the work presented here ,",
    "our objectives were ( i ) to calculate the chemical structure of protoplanetary disks on small ( sub - milli - arcsecond in the inner disk ) scales , ( ii ) to investigate the influence of various chemical processes , such as non - thermal desorption and grain - surface chemistry , thought to be important in disks , and ( iii ) to subsequently determine potential molecular tracers of each process .",
    "we also used our model to ( i ) compute molecular line emission profiles for rotational transitions which have been observed in disks using existing facilities , ( ii ) compare our modelled line profiles and intensities with existing observations and ( iii ) produce molecular line emission maps at the expected spatial resolution of alma for disks at various distances and inclinations . this second study and corresponding set of results",
    "will be covered in a subsequent paper ( walsh et al . in preparation ) .",
    "our study also aims to help answer some fundamental questions concerning the evolution of stars , planets and ultimately , life .",
    "is it possible for primordial ( possibly organic ) material created in a young star s protoplanetary disk to survive the assimilation into planets and other planetary system objects ?",
    "is our solar system s chemical and thus , planetary composition unique ?",
    "how intrinsically linked are star formation , planet formation and the origin of life in the universe ?",
    "these questions are evermore important as we move into the era of exoplanet research and the hunt for planets and the signatures of life in external stellar systems .    in section  [ diskmodel ]",
    "we describe the theoretical foundation and generation of the physical model used to characterise our protoplanetary disk ( section  [ physicalmodel ] ) and the chemical network we have collated and used in our calculation of the disk chemical evolution ( section  [ chemical model ] ) including gas - phase chemistry ( section  [ gasphasechemistry ] ) , photochemistry ( section  [ photochemistry ] ) , gas - grain interactions ( section  [ gasgraininteractions ] ) and grain - surface chemistry ( section  [ grainsurfacechemistry ] ) .",
    "the results of our chemical evolution calculations are covered in section  [ results ] where we discuss the chemical structure and stratification in the disk ( section  [ chemicalstructure ] ) , the effects of our included chemical processes ( sections  [ nonthermaldesorptioneffects ] and [ grainsurfacechemistryeffects ] ) , the disk ionisation fraction ( section  [ diskionisationfraction ] ) and the radial molecular column densities ( section  [ columndensities ] ) .",
    "we briefly discuss our work in relation to similar projects by other research groups in section  [ comparison ] and finally , in section  [ summary ] , we summarise our work and outline our main conclusions and further work we intend to undertake .",
    "the physical model of a protoplanetary disk we use in this work is from @xcite with the addition of x - ray heating as described in @xcite .",
    "they self - consistently modelled the density and temperature profiles of gas and dust in a protoplanetary disk accounting for uv and x - ray irradiation by the central star and subsequently computed molecular hydrogen line emission at ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths . here , we have used this model to compute the chemical structure of a protoplanetary disk with the ultimate aim to expand on their work by calculating molecular line emission from disks at ( sub)mm wavelengths . in the remainder of this section , we give a brief overview of our physical model and we refer readers to the original papers for the mathematical and computational details .",
    "we consider an axisymmetric disk surrounding a typical t tauri star with mass , @xmath12  =  0.5  @xmath13 , radius , @xmath14  =  2  @xmath15 and temperature , @xmath16  =  4000  k @xcite .",
    "the density and temperature distributions are determined through iteratively solving the equations for hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction and the local thermal balance between the heating and cooling of the gas .",
    "the theoretical foundation of this model comes from the _ standard accretion disk model _ of @xcite and @xcite which defines a surface density distribution for the disk given the parent star s mass and radius and a disk mass accretion rate , @xmath17 .",
    "the kinematic viscosity in the disk is parameterised according to the work of @xcite , the so - called _",
    "@xmath18-prescription_. we adopt a viscous parameter , @xmath18  =  0.01 and a mass accretion rate , @xmath17  =  10@xmath19  @xmath13  yr@xmath20 .",
    "the heating mechanisms included are grain photo - electric heating by far - ultraviolet photons and x - ray heating due to hydrogen ionisation by x - ray photons with cooling via gas - grain collisions and line transitions .",
    "we use a model spectrum created by fitting the observed xmm - newton x - ray spectrum of the classical t tauri star , tw hya ( e.g.  @xcite ) with a two - temperature thin thermal plasma model ( mekal model see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is @xmath21  @xmath0  @xmath22  erg  s@xmath20 and the resulting x - ray spectrum is given in figure  1 of @xcite .",
    "the uv radiation field in disks has two sources , the star and the interstellar medium . in this disk model , the radiation field due to the t tauri star has three components : black - body emission at the star s effective temperature , optically thin hydrogenic bremsstrahlung emission and strong lyman-@xmath18 line emission .",
    "all components are necessary to accurately model the excess uv emission observed towards classical t tauri stars thought to arise from an accretion shock as disk material impinges upon the stellar surface ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the total fuv luminosity in our model is @xmath23  @xmath0  @xmath24  erg  s@xmath20 with the calculation of the radiation field in the disk described in detail in appendix  c of @xcite and the resulting spectrum shown in figure  c.1 in that paper .",
    "we assume the dust and gas in the disk is well - mixed and adopt the dust - size distribution model which reproduces the observational extinction curve of dense clouds @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the dust opacity in the disk is as described in appendix  d of @xcite with the resulting monochromatic absorption coefficient shown in figure  d.1 .",
    "we note here that this is an over - simplification of the treatment of the dust - size distribution in protoplanetary disks and we are currently working on improving our model by adding in the effects of dust - grain settling and coagulation .    in figure  [ figure1 ]",
    "we display the resulting number density ( @xmath25 ) , gas temperature ( k ) and dust temperature ( k ) as a function of disk radius and height ( top , middle and bottom rows , respectively ) .",
    "to illustrate the extreme vertical gradients in the physical conditions at small radii , we display the density and temperature both within 10  au ( left panels ) and 305  au ( right panels ) .",
    "we describe the physical structure of our disk in the appendix .",
    "the structure of the disk described in the preceding section leads to a multitude of different physical regimes and as such , we need to account for every chemical process which may occur .",
    "the axisymmetric structure results in a cold , dense midplane where even the most volatile molecules are expected to freeze out onto dust grains creating an icy mantle and depleting the gas of molecules . moving in the vertical direction ,",
    "the density decreases and the temperature increases driving the evaporation of molecules from grain surfaces and stimulating a rich gas - phase chemistry resulting in further molecular synthesis .",
    "further towards the surface , the radiation fields increase in strength dissociating and ionising molecules into constituent radicals , atoms and ions .",
    "a similar stratification is expected in the radial direction as the temperature and density in the disk midplane both increase with decreasing distance from the star .",
    "when the midplane dust temperature reaches a value higher than the desorption temperature of a particular molecule , it is returned to the gas phase .",
    "this point is known as the _ snow line _ and can occur at a unique radius for each molecule . at small radii , due to the high densities found in the midplane",
    ", there is a significant column density of material shielding this region from the intense uv and x - ray fields of the star such that molecules are expected to survive in the midplane at radii within @xmath0  0.1  au .    in order to investigate the chemical structure",
    "thoroughly , we used a large gas - phase network supplemented with gas - grain interactions , including freeze out and thermal desorption .",
    "we considered various non - thermal desorption mechanisms , namely , cosmic - ray induced desorption , photodesorption and x - ray desorption . to probe the efficacy of molecular synthesis on grain - surfaces",
    "we also added a large grain - surface reaction network .",
    "our gas - phase chemistry is extracted from the latest release of the ` dipole - enhanced ' version of the umist database for astrochemistry ( http://www.udfa.net ) , henceforth referred to as ` rate06 ' @xcite .",
    "we include almost the entire rate06 gas - phase network removing only those species ( and thus reactions ) which contain fluorine , f , and phosphorus , p , in order to reduce computation time .",
    "we deemed the loss of f- and p - containing species to have a minimal impact on the remaining chemistry .",
    "our gas - phase network thus consists of 4336 reactions involving 378 species composed of the elements h , he , c , n , o , na , mg , si , s , cl and fe . the initial elemental fractional abundances ( relative to total h nuclei density ) we use are the set of oxygen - rich low - metallicity abundances from @xcite , listed in table  8 of @xcite .",
    "we find by @xmath26 years , the typical age of protoplanetary disks , the chemistry has forgotten its origins , justifying our use of initial elemental abundances .",
    "we intend in future models to calculate the chemical evolution of a parcel of gas as it follows a streamline in the accretion flow in which case the input abundances should reflect the molecular make - up of the ambient cloud material .",
    "our model grid has over 12,000 grid points in 129 logarithmically spaced radial steps from 0.04  au to 305  au .      in the models presented here ,",
    "we have approximated our photoreaction rates at each point in the disk , @xmath27 , by scaling the rates from rate06 ( which assume the interstellar uv field ) using the wavelength integrated uv flux calculated at each point , @xmath28 .",
    "hence , the rate for a particular photoreaction at each @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the interstellar uv flux and @xmath32 is the rate expected in the interstellar medium .",
    "gas - grain interactions are important in large areas of protoplanetary disks as the dust temperature can reach values lower than the freeze - out temperatures of molecules .",
    "if the freeze out of gas - phase species is allowed , then the evaporation of molecules from dust grains must also be included . in this work",
    ", we consider both the thermal and non - thermal desorption of molecules from dust grains . for the thermal desorption of a particular molecule to occur",
    ", the dust - grain temperature must exceed the freeze - out temperature of that molecule .",
    "non - thermal desorption requires an input of energy from an external source and is thus independent of dust - grain temperature . as protoplanetary disks are irradiated by uv and x - ray photons from the central star as well as uv photons and cosmic - rays originating from the interstellar medium , the non - thermal desorption mechanisms we investigate are cosmic - ray induced desorption , photodesorption , and x - ray desorption .",
    "our gas - phase chemical network has thus been supplemented with an additional 1154 gas - grain interactions involving 149 surface species .",
    "the accretion rate ( or freeze - out rate ) , @xmath33 , of species @xmath34 onto dust - grain surfaces is treated using the standard prescription @xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the sticking coefficient , here assumed to equal unity for all species , @xmath37 is the geometrical cross section of a dust grain with radius , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the thermal velocity of species @xmath34 at a temperature , @xmath40 and with mass , @xmath41 , @xmath42 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath43 is the number density of dust grains .",
    "the thermal desorption rate , @xmath44 , of species @xmath34 is dependent on dust - grain temperature , @xmath45 @xcite , and is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the binding energy of species @xmath34 to the dust grain in units of k. the characteristic vibrational frequency of each adsorbed species in its potential well , @xmath48 , is represented by a harmonic oscillator relation @xcite , @xmath49 where , here , @xmath47 is in units of erg and @xmath50  @xmath51 is the number density of surface sites on each dust grain .",
    "the binding energies , @xmath52 , for several important molecules ( mainly following those collated by @xcite and @xcite ) are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "we intend to conduct a review of our set of desorption energies in light of more recent experimental results e.g.  a recent investigation into the desorption of methanol by @xcite determined a binding energy of @xmath11  5000  k , as opposed to the theoretical value of 2140 k used here ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "this binding energy was determined for pure methanol ice as opposed to methanol adsorbed onto , or mixed with , water ice .",
    "we find throughout our model that the ratio of methanol to water ice is less than 1% .",
    "similar experiments for methanol adsorbed onto water ice ( brown , private communication ) suggest that the binding energy of methanol in this complex is comparable with that determined for pure methanol but due to overlapping desorption features the results are difficult to analyse .",
    "recent work by @xcite comparing laboratory data with observations of methanol in young stellar objects ( ysos ) suggests that methanol ice in these environments likely exists as pure ice or mixed with co and/or co@xmath1 ice which is consistent with its formation via hydrogenation of co on dust grains .",
    "considering the latter molecules are non - polar , it is possible that the binding energy of methanol in astrophysical ices is lower than that determined in the laboratory experiments .",
    "increasing the binding energy of methanol to a value of @xmath11  5000  k will increase the desorption temperature from @xmath11  30  k to 40  k to @xmath0  100  k. this will push the ` snow line ' for methanol closer to the star but should have little effect on the outer disk methanol abundances where the dust temperature is @xmath53  30  k. we expect non - thermal desorption to dominate over thermal desorption in the upper layers of the disk .",

    "they assume that dust grains with a radius of 0.1  @xmath55 m are impulsively heated by the impact of relativistic fe nuclei with energies of 20 to 70 mev nucleon@xmath20 which deposit , on average , an energy of 0.4  mev into each dust grain . assuming that the majority of molecules desorb around 70  k , the cosmic - ray induced desorption rate can be approximated by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the the thermal desorption energy of species @xmath34 at a temperature of 70  k , calculated using equation  ( [ thermaldesorption ] ) .",
    "the parameter , @xmath58 , is the fraction of time spent by grains in the vicinity of 70  k and can loosely defined as the ratio of the desorption cooling time ( @xmath59  s@xmath20 ) to the time interval between successive heatings to 70  k ( 3.16  @xmath60  s ) so that @xmath61 ( for further details see @xcite ) .",
    "note that the method of calculating the cosmic - ray induced desorption rates is species dependent and a function of surface binding energy .",
    "in contrast , the photodesorption rates are indiscriminate , based on the experimental results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their results suggest each photon absorbed by the grain mantle returns a particular number of molecules , independent of binding energy , to the gas phase so that the desorption rate of each species varies according to its fractional abundance on dust - grain surfaces .",
    "the overall photodesorption rate is calculated , similar to the work of @xcite and @xcite , using @xmath62 where , @xmath63 is the uv radiative flux in units of photons  @xmath51  s@xmath20 , @xmath64 is the experimentally determined photodesorption yield in units of molecules photon@xmath20 , @xmath65 is the geometrical dust - grain cross section in @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the fractional abundance of dust grains .",
    "note that the attenuation of uv radiation is accounted for in our calculation of @xmath63 .",
    "hence , the photodesorption rate for a specific species , @xmath68 , is calculated using @xmath69 where , @xmath70 is given by equation  ( [ photodesorption1 ] ) , @xmath71 is the number density of species @xmath34 frozen out onto grain surfaces and @xmath72 is the total number density of grain - surface species .",
    "more recent experiments by @xcite suggest that photodesorption rates are also dependent on the depth of the ice layer on grain surfaces with the molecular yield also dependent on ice composition .",
    "we intend to explore these experimental results in future models .    for the x - ray desorption rates , we follow the same formulation as for photodesorption , covered in the theory of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "at this point , it is worth noting that x - ray desorption is the least theoretically or experimentally constrained of all the non - thermal desorption mechanisms considered here .",

    "we adopt a conservative estimate of the yield of 200 molecules photon@xmath20 as this is the value for the dust morphology which most closely matches our simple dust - grain model .",

    "the uv field is strong enough to dissociate co into its constituent atoms ( atomic carbon and oxygen ) , however , the dust temperature is also low enough for the freeze out of molecules which have binding energies larger than that of co e.g.  h@xmath1o . by a time of @xmath107  years , the time at which we extract our abundances , atomic carbon and oxygen",
    "are trapped in molecules contained in the icy mantle . above this height , the dust temperature becomes high enough for many molecules to desorb thermally thus replenishing the stock of c and o to reform co. in region ( iii ) , a similar effect to that in region ( ii ) occurs due to the decoupling of the dust and gas temperatures in the disk surface with the dust temperature up to two orders of magnitude lower than the gas temperature .",
    "the thermal desorption rate is dependent only on the dust temperature ( @xmath108  @xmath109 ) whereas the accretion rate depends both on the gas temperature and the number density of dust grains ( see equations  [ accretionrate ] and [ thermaldesorption ] ) . since the gas temperature can be much higher than the dust temperature in this region , the accretion rate can supersede that of thermal desorption so that by @xmath107 years , molecules which can survive the intense uv radiation field are able to freeze out onto dust grains . specifically , h@xmath1o molecules are able to survive as ice on dust grains thereby depleting the gas phase of oxygen - bearing molecules such as co.          the left columns of figures  [ figure5 ] and [ figure6 ] display the fractional abundances of several molecules and molecular ions as a function of disk height at radii @xmath98  =  10  au and 305  au , respectively , comparing the results from model 0 ( solid lines ) with model crh ( dotted lines )",
    ". cosmic - ray induced desorption has the smallest effect on the gas - phase abundances and only in the outer disk midplane .",
    "the fractional abundances of gas - phase co and h@xmath1o are enhanced in the disk midplane at 305  au in the results for model crh , compared with those for model 0 , although the values reached remain orders of magnitude smaller than those in the upper disk layers .",
    "the fractional abundance of n@xmath1h@xmath5 is also enhanced , due in part to the release of n@xmath1 from dust grains in this region by cosmic - rays and , in fact , reaches its maximum fractional abundance in the disk midplane . as our model disk is truncated at 305  au , we would expect the effects of cosmic - ray induced desorption to continue beyond this radius .",
    "photodesorption is the most experimentally constrained non - thermal desorption mechanism we have included in our model .",
    "photodesorption has an effect in the upper disk layers where the uv radiation field has reached an appreciable strength yet the temperature remains low enough for freeze out to occur .",
    "we compare the results from model 0 ( solid lines ) with those from model ph+crh ( dotted lines ) in the middle plots of figures  [ figure5 ] and [ figure6 ] .",
    "photodesorption enhances the abundance of molecules in the molecular region of the disk , counteracting the depletion effects discussed at the beginning of section  [ nonthermaldesorptioneffects ] .",
    "clearly seen at a radius of 10  au is the smoothing of molecular abundances throughout the middle region of the disk with both model results converging higher in the surface . at a radius of 305  au , there is a smoothing out of abundances counteracting depletion but also a slight difference in the distribution of molecules in the surface regions .",
    "the fractional abundances of co and cs are enhanced in model ph+crh relative to model 0 , whereas those of hco@xmath5 , h@xmath1o , hcn and n@xmath1h@xmath5 are reduced .",
    "this is due to the alteration of gas - phase chemistry when photodesorption is included as a significant amount of all molecules can remain in the gas phase in the mid and upper layers of the disk .",
    "thus , those molecules which ordinarily would be frozen out in the absence of photodesorption are available to take part in gas - phase reactions e.g.  n@xmath1h@xmath5 is destroyed via reaction with gas - phase co so that an enhancement in the abundance of the latter leads to a corresponding drop in that of the former .",
    "x - ray desorption is the least theoretically or experimentally constrained non - thermal desorption mechanism we considered , hence , we have used conservative estimates of molecular yields and thus x - ray desorption rates .",
    "the right - hand plots in figures  [ figure5 ] and [ figure6 ] suggest that , even using conservative estimates , x - ray desorption has the largest effect on gas - phase molecular abundances .",
    "x - rays , with their higher energy , can penetrate deeper into the disk material than uv photons , hence , x - rays have an effect in the disk midplane as well as in the molecular region . at @xmath98",

    "the fractional abundances of all molecules considered here , with the exception of cs , are enhanced in the midplane of the disk , to values comparable with those found in the upper disk regions .",
    "in fact , it appears that the inclusion of x - ray desorption acts to smooth or homogenise the fractional abundances of gas - phase co , h@xmath1o and hco@xmath5 throughout the depth of the disk .",
    "again , as seen in the results for photodesorption , the gas - phase distributions are altered in model xd compared with model 0 due to the alteration of the gas - phase chemistry . in the upper disk , the results for models ph+crh and xd are similar with the exception of the fractional abundance of cs which is enhanced in abundance between height of @xmath11  70  au and @xmath11  150  au in model xd relative to model ph+crh .",

    "the required turbulence is generated via magneto - rotational instabilities or mri @xcite .",
    "for effective accretion , the ionisation fraction is required to exceed a critical level which is dependent on the nature of the star - disk system ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we use a protoplanetary disk model in which the gas density and temperature distributions are obtained self - consistently and uv and x - ray irradiation by the central star is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation . to this",
    "we applied a large comprehensive chemical network including gas - phase chemistry , gas - grain interactions and grain - surface chemistry .",
    "we investigated the effects of each non - thermal desorption mechanism thought to be important in disks : cosmic - ray induced desorption , photodesorption and x - ray desorption .",
    "we also added a large grain - surface network to investigate the effectiveness of grain - surface reactions on the synthesis of relatively complex organic molecules .    using the results from model ph+crh ( see table  [ table2 ] ) extracted at a time of @xmath26  years , we find that the disk chemical structure closely mirrors the disk physical structure with the freeze out of molecules onto dust grains creating an icy mantle in the cold , dense midplane and an abundance of molecules in a layer above the midplane created through sublimation and the resulting rich gas - phase chemistry . in the disk surface ,",
    "the molecular abundances drop as the uv and x - ray radiation fields peak in strength dissociating molecules and ionising both molecules and atoms .",
    "the resulting disk ionisation fraction increases with increasing disk height .",
    "there is similar stratification in the radial direction as the increasing temperature drives the evaporation of molecules .",
    "the temperature dependence of the desorption energies results in a unique ` snow - line ' for each molecules with more volatile molecules returned to the gas in the midplane at larger radii than less volatile ones .",
    "in particular , both hcn and h@xmath1o remain frozen onto dust grains to within @xmath11  1 to 2 au of the central star .",
    "the addition of cosmic - ray induced desorption has only a small effect on the gas - phase abundances in the outer disk midplane although since our model is truncated at 305  au we would expect that this effect will continue at radii beyond this value .",
    "photodesorption , the most experimentally constrained of the mechanisms considered here , has a larger effect although only in the molecular and surface regions of the disk where there is an appreciable uv flux .",
    "it is especially effective at enhancing the gas - phase abundances of non - volatile molecules such as h@xmath1o .",
    "x - ray desorption , has the largest effect , smoothing the abundances of gas - phase species throughout the height of the disk and acting to homogenise the fractional abundances .",
    "however , x - ray desorption is the least theoretically or experimentally constrained and thus our results must be treated with caution , pending further investigation .",
    "the addition of grain - surface chemistry also yields some encouraging results worthy of revisiting and further study . in the outer disk , where the freeze out of molecules is most prevalent , the abundances of relatively complex organic molecules e.g.  ch@xmath2oh , hcooch@xmath2 and ch@xmath2och@xmath2 are enhanced to potentially observable values when grain - surface chemistry and photodesorption are included in our model .",
    "thus , the observation of rotational transitions of these , and related , species in protoplanetary disks should provide an excellent means of testing grain - surface chemistry theory .",
    "due to limitations in existing facilities , the most complex molecule observed , as yet , in disks is h@xmath1co .",
    "alma , however , will have the sensitivity and spectral resolution necessary to observe rotational transitions in these minor species .",
    "indeed , preliminary synthetic spectra we have calculated suggest that the rotational transition lines of methanol are enhanced above the detection threshold of alma when grain - surface chemistry is included in our model ( walsh et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "we have shown that running models of this nature , in which we test experimental data and theory , varying the different chemical ingredients , are necessary for disentangling the different physical influences on the chemical content of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the influence of the physical conditions and processes on the molecular content is also a strong function of radius and so high - resolution models , which trace the chemical structure on small scales , are also preferred . in this brief overview of our model , we have shown that x - ray desorption and grain - surface chemistry can have a powerful effect on the molecular content of disks and we intend to expand upon the work presented here with follow - up papers on both chemical processes .",
    "although in this paper we have shown that the distribution and radial column densities of particular molecules are sensitive to the inclusion or omission of certain chemical processes , in order to test the viability of using these molecules as tracers we must compute the radiative transfer in the disk and directly compare our results with observations .",
    "this work will be reported in a subsequent paper ( walsh et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",

    "the density decreases as a function of increasing disk radius and height with the densest region of the disk found in the disk midplane close to the star ( @xmath0  10@xmath117  @xmath25 ) and the most diffuse , in the disk surface at large radii ( @xmath0  10@xmath118  @xmath25 ) so that the density range in our model covers almost 10 orders of magnitude .",
    "the density gradient in the vertical direction becomes more extreme with decreasing radius . at a radius of 0.1  au , the density ranges from @xmath0  10@xmath119  @xmath25 in the disk surface to @xmath0  10@xmath117  @xmath25 in the midplane , a change of seven orders of magnitude over a distance of @xmath11  0.03  au .",

    "gas - grain collisions become ineffective so the gas cools via radiative line transitions . at a radius of 10  au ,",

    "finally , the cosmic - ray and x - ray ionisation rates are displayed in figure  [ figure9 ] ( top and bottom right panels , respectively ) as functions of @xmath96 at a range of radii .",
    "note the linear scale used for the cosmic - ray ionisation rate . beyond @xmath98  @xmath11  10  au",
    ", the cosmic - ray ionisation rate is constant ( at the interstellar value of @xmath0  10@xmath126  s@xmath20 ) throughout the height of the disk as cosmic - ray particles , with energies @xmath0  mev , are highly penetrative . in the inner disk ,",
    "e.g.  @xmath98  =  1  au , the column density of material through to the disk midplane is large enough for some attenuation of cosmic - rays , however , the midplane ionisation rate at this radius in our model is still relatively high at @xmath11  60  % of the interstellar value . at even smaller radii , @xmath127  0.1  au , the midplane cosmic - ray ionisation rate",
