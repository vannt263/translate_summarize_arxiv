    "a fundamental prediction of lcdm models of structure formation is the hierarchical build up of galaxies via mergers with a rate that declines over time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "observations of this process at low and high redshift are necessary to test these predictions , assess the effects of interactions , and to help clarify our current understanding of galaxy assembly .",

    "however , identifying and studying mergers and interactions is difficult , largely because definitions vary , tidal features and interaction indicators can be faint , and morphologies are difficult to quantify . at higher redshifts ( @xmath10 ) , this is more challenging as galaxies become fainter and less resolved .",
    "although nonparametric methods have been developed to characterise the morphology of high - redshift systems @xcite , such analyses are best done using the superior efficiency and resolution of optical data but , as a result , contribute an additional complication of linking the observed clumpy and chaotic rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) to the better understood rest - frame optical morphology .",
    "the lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) detected by the lyman break colour - selection technique @xcite are a well - studied population of galaxies at high - redshift .",
    "deep _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst )",
    "images of @xmath11 lbgs in surveys such as goods , cosmos , and the udf show a wide range of rest - frame uv morphologies  from single compact or diffuse systems to multiple compact star forming components with , or without , diffuse emission ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter morphology has been interpreted as either star forming regions within a single coalescing galaxy and/or the result of interactions or mergers .",
    "because of the faint nature of @xmath0 lbgs ( @xmath12 corresponds to m@xmath13 ) , low - resolution spectroscopy can only achieve a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of a few with 8m - class telescopes for galaxies with m@xmath14 using reasonable integration times .",
    "this limitation prohibits detailed investigations of individual lbgs . except for the very brightest cases , detailed studies require composite spectra and/or rare gravitationally lensed systems .",
    "composite spectral analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has provided great insight into the average properties of lbgs but dilutes the features and relationships particular to individual systems .",
    "gravitationally lensed lbg systems provide magnified flux that boosts the s / n of individual systems , but the total number of these systems is small , their reconstruction analyses are subject to model constraints , and their chance discoveries do not allow a study at desired redshifts .",
    "recently , infrared integral field observations using adaptive optics have been very informative on the kinematics of a sample of @xmath15 lbgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from prominent rest - frame optical features .",
    "although this approach has been effective on relatively luminous lbgs , it would be prohibitively time consuming to compile a statistical sample of typical ( including faint ) systems using existing instruments .",
    "moreover , this method becomes increasingly difficult for higher redshift populations as key features are shifted out of the range of wavelength sensitivity . as a result of the above limitations , a clear and consistent interpretation of the morphological and spectroscopic effect of mergers and interactions of typical lbgs at @xmath16 via conventional approaches",
    "lay beyond the sensitivity thresholds and capabilities of current ground - based ao - assisted or space - based observations .    a standard method to identify a large number of merger and interacting galaxy candidates at low- to intermediate redshift and to avoid",

    "galaxy pairs with observed separations of @xmath9 @xmath2kpc and velocity offsets of @xmath17 km s@xmath18 are likely to interact and/or merge and can be more easily and consistently observed and quantified .",
    "moreover , galaxies found in close pairs at high redshift have a higher likelihood of an imminent merger than at low redshift based in part on the fact that there are fewer galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , close pairs at high redshift provide a means to identify galaxies that are interacting or are destined to interact on a short timescale and a strong constraint on the merger rate .",
    "finally , the detailed behaviour of close pairs can be tracked in matched high resolution cosmological simulations to glean information beyond that of the observations .",
    "although the expected number of lbgs in close pairs can be inferred photometrically from the observed angular correlation function , spectroscopy is necessary to help differentiate actual close pairs from false pairs that have small projected separations on the sky . in order to gather a large number of lbg spectra , nearly all surveys to date have utilised optical low - resolution multi - object spectroscopy ( mos ) .",
    "this method uses slitmasks to place slitlets at the locations of selected targets but can not acquire spectroscopy for objects with very small projected separations on the sky or that conflict in the dispersion direction .",
    "while mos is efficient in acquiring a statistical sample of typical lbgs , this shortcoming makes it difficult or impossible for a single slitmask to acquire information for many of the galaxies closely spaced on the sky .",
    "a programme employing a number of overlapping slitmask observations of the same area of the sky could , in principle , resolve this issue .",
    "however , we show below that not all close galaxy pairs at @xmath0 are easily identifiable from their imaging alone and would introduce systematics in such a time expensive endeavour .    a different technique , which we introduce here , allows existing mos datasets to be used to study close and interacting pairs at high redshift .",
    "the density and clustering behaviour of lbgs predict that a small fraction of close pairs are expected to fall serendipitously into the area probed by the mos slitlets .",
    "moreover , because the slitlets in conventional lbg surveys have random orientations with respect to the serendipitous close pairs on the sky , they produce samples unbiased by selection . in this manner , the serendipitous pairs reflect the underlying close and interacting lbg pair behaviour and effectively circumvent the mos mechanical constraints .",
    "we analyse a conventionally acquired nine - field deep keck imaging and spectroscopic survey for @xmath0 lbgs and find five serendipitous spectroscopic close pairs .",
    "we use 509 colour - selected and 140 spectroscopically confirmed lbgs , the large @xmath0 photometric lbg dataset of @xcite , and a high - resolution cosmological simulation to investigate the distribution of close pair separations and the expectation of the serendipitous pairs .",
    "we present several lines of evidence from a detailed analysis of the imaging and spectroscopic data that support the close pair / interacting nature of the serendipitous detections .",
    "we show that the properties of this unique sample , in turn , provide insight into the rest - frame uv properties of the lbg population that are otherwise inaccessible and a means to help identify high - redshift interactions in ground - based data .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : we describe relevant information regarding the data and data acquisition in  [ obs ] .",

    "the survey consists of deep imaging and spectroscopy of nine widely - separated fields covering @xmath20 arcmin@xmath21 .",

    "we obtained follow - up spectroscopy of all nine fields using lris .",
    "the multiple fields suppress the effects of cosmic variance and provide @xmath22 colour - selected and @xmath23 spectroscopically identified lbgs for statistical analysis .",
    "details of the observations , data reduction , and lbg analysis can be found in c05 and @xcite .",
    "below , we briefly discuss a few relevant specifics of the data .",
    "the @xmath0 lbg candidates in our survey are selected by their @xmath24bvri colours .",
    "although the deep images can select lbgs to fainter magnitudes , we restrict our analysis in this paper to lbgs with m@xmath25 in order to define a sample that has ( 1 ) photometry accurate to @xmath26 mag uncertainty in all filters that probe the rest - frame uv continua , ( 2 ) follow - up spectroscopy , ( 3 ) defined photometric selection functions , and ( 4 ) a measured spatial correlation function .    the spectroscopic component of our survey follows a conventional approach to gather a large number of @xmath0 lbg spectra using mos slitmasks .",
    "the survey was not originally designed to study interacting lbgs or to measure close spectroscopic pairs .",
    "the physical constraints of mos slitmasks can prevent acquisition of galaxies that are closely spaced on the sky or those that fall in the dispersion direction of the targeted observations .",
    "this situation is illustrated in figure  [ phot_pairs ] for two spectroscopically confirmed lbgs and associated colour - selected close pair candidates from our survey .",
    "however , because each mos slitlet covers a non - negligible area of the sky ( @xmath27 arcsec@xmath21 on average ) , occasionally a close pair will have a small enough separation or coincidental near alignment to be detected in a slitlet that was originally intended for a single photometrically identified colour - selected lbg candidate .",
    "the mos slitlets in our survey were centred on the lbg candidates with position angles near the parallactic angle of the observations to minimise wavelength - dependent flux loss caused by atmospheric dispersion . as a result , this is an unbiased spectroscopic survey for the purposes discussed here because the data were acquired randomly with respect to the orientation of close pairs on the sky .",

    "moreover , the distribution follows the trend found in @xcite for lbgs displaying dominant ly@xmath6 emission .    in treating the sscpairs as close pairs throughout this section",

    "we find that the @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath62 are in good agreement with this picture and are at odds with an interpretation that the sscpairs represent starforming regions in single systems .",
    "we look for observational precedent in the literature to help interpret the sscpairs by first exploring the lbg sample of @xcite .",
    "this sample consists of deep spectroscopy of 14 lbgs at @xmath0 gathered for the purpose of measuring the fraction of escaping continuum flux shortward of the lyman limit .",
    "the observations are valuable for an assessment here because they were selected in the same manner , lay within the same redshift path , and have spectroscopy obtained using the same instrument ( lris ) . moreover , the observations are beneficial here because they have a slightly higher resolution over the bulk of the more relevant wavelengths ( @xmath96  rest - frame ) and have @xmath97 longer exposure times for s / n of @xmath98 .",
    "in addition , the associated imaging data were obtained with similar or , for the subset of space - based data , superior depth and resolution .    of the 14 lbgs in that sample ,",
    "nine are elbgs .",
    "the ly@xmath6 ew distribution of the sample is very similar to that of our full spectroscopic lbg sample ( k - s test , @xmath99 ) .",
    "one object , d3 , is considered a single system by @xcite but consists of two galaxies ( and separate spectra ) with an angular separation of @xmath100 ( @xmath101 @xmath2kpc ) .",
    "three of the nine elbgs are reported to show double - peak ly@xmath6 emission . because both components of d3 show ly@xmath6 emission , merging the two spectra would create a double - peak spectrum , making it a fourth double - peak system ( similar to 0957 - 0941 in our sample ) .",
    "relevant to later discussion , of the two lbgs shown by @xcite to exhibit measurable lyman continuum flux , one is the double - peak ly@xmath6 emission system c49 and the other is the pair d3 .",
    "narrow - band imaging of d3 shows that it is detected as a ly@xmath6 `` blob '' in the sample of @xcite with ly@xmath6 emission extending over @xmath102 arcsec@xmath103 .",
    "we now analyse the double - peak systems of @xcite as we did for the sscpairs using the published information .",
    "looking at the velocity offsets of the ly@xmath6 feature of the four double - peak systems , we find @xmath104 km s@xmath18 , cf .",
    "@xmath105 km s@xmath18 for our sample .",
    "shapley and coworkers measure one ism absorption redshift for each of the three ly@xmath6 double - peak systems ( pair d3 has separate values ) .",
    "if we assign the reported ism absorption redshifts to the highest redshift ly@xmath6 peak , we find @xmath106 km s@xmath18 .",
    "this places these systems at the high - end tail of the @xmath62 distribution for the full lbg population , with one system having the highest ( @xmath107 km s@xmath18 ) velocity difference of the entire @xmath0 lbg spectroscopic sample .",
    "assigning the features in this manner implies that it is highly improbable that the double - peak systems are single lbgs .    instead , if we assign the ism absorption redshifts to the lowest redshift ly@xmath6 peaks we find @xmath108 km s@xmath18 .",
    "while the central value matches the expectations of elbgs and is in good agreement with lbgs in general , the large scatter of the three systems is unrepresentative of the @xmath109 km s@xmath18 scatter that we find for three - galaxy random samples taken from the lbg and elbg data .",
    "in addition , we see similar relative offset and scatter behaviour when we assign the higher redshift ism features to the lower redshift ly@xmath6 emission ( and vice - versa ) in our sscpair sample ( section  [ lya - ism ] ) .",
    "when inspecting the double - peak system c32 , we find that the lowest redshift ly@xmath6 peak is blueshifted with respect to the ism absorption lines by @xmath110 km s@xmath18 .",
    "if we assign only this system to the higher ly@xmath6 peak , then the three systems exhibit @xmath111 km s@xmath18 and the scatter is reduced to the level of the expectations . when including the identified pair d3 ( @xmath112 km s@xmath18 ) in the ly@xmath6 double - peak sample , we find @xmath113 km s@xmath18 , which is more consistent with the distribution and scatter of the elbg and lbg population .",
    "although matching ism features to one of the ly@xmath6 emission peaks can make the double - peak systems fall in line with typical lbgs , what should we make of the second ly@xmath6 feature ?    the above analysis shows that it is more likely that the three ly@xmath6 double - peak lbgs are close pairs similar to d3 and the sscpair sample as opposed to single systems .",
    "such an interpretation produces a @xmath62 distribution in better agreement with the expectations of the lbg population and significantly reduces the scatter .",
    "it is possible that the presence of a second set of ism absorption lines in the @xcite sample may have been unexpected and ignored , identified and interpreted as strong ism mixing , or identified and considered of too low significance as a result of blending .",
    "although the s / n of the @xcite lbg sample is higher than what is typical for @xmath0 lbg spectra , it does remain relatively low in that ism absorption lines remain difficult to study with great confidence .",
    "future investigation of the data ( for example , by probing nebular lines in the ir ) could resolve this matter .",
    "we remark that @xcite find @xmath114% ( @xmath115% depending on slit orientation for d3 ) of the elbgs in their sample , and @xmath116% ( @xmath117% ) of the entire sample , to be double - peak systems that meet our sscpair criteria .",
    "the data imply that higher s / n and/or higher resolution should reveal a larger fraction of sscpairs than that seen serendipitously in our low - s / n , low - resolution survey , with the true fraction potentially even higher .",
    "next , we examine the study of @xcite that consists of space - based imaging of 216 @xmath118 lbgs and ground - based spectroscopy using lris with a similar configuration as our survey . in that work , the morphology of lbgs is quantified using a non - parametric analysis within @xmath119 radius ( @xmath120 kpc ) which directly reflects the regime of the sscpairs .",
    "in addition , this is the regime where systems are most sensitive to interaction that can visibly change their morphology and star formation properties .",
    "law and coworkers investigate the rest - frame uv morphology of their lbg sample by quantifying the gini parameter , colour dispersion , multiplicity , and size .",
    "the gini parameter is a measure of the nebulosity or nucleated nature of the system , the colour dispersion is measured using v @xmath121 broadband colours and corresponds to rest - frame @xmath122  at @xmath0 , and the multiplicity parameter quantifies the multiple component nature of the sources .",
    "@xcite investigate the relationships between the morphological parameters and the spectroscopic features ly@xmath6 ew , low- and high - ionisation ism ew , and @xmath123 . as noted in that work ,",
    "only ly@xmath6 ew shows a significant and consistent trend at @xmath0 with all four morphological parameters .",
    "the ly@xmath6 relationships indicate greater ly@xmath6 emission ew with decreasing system size , decreasing nebulosity ( increasing gini parameter ) , decreasing number of nuclei ( multiplicity ) or nuclei separation , and bluer colours .",
    "in addition , and in reference to low - redshift uvlgs , a visual inspection of the space - based images shows that systems with bright nuclei typically have one or two components whereas systems with faint nuclei typically have three or more components and are found in more diffuse systems .",
    "ly@xmath6 ew is seen to be strongest for large values of the gini parameter indicating that nucleated sources are more likely to be elbgs and diffuse sources are more likely to be albgs .",
    "the ly@xmath6 ew increases monotonically over the multiplicity range with values that indicate two strong double nucleated sources ( multiplicity parameter value @xmath124 ) down to a single nucleated source ( multiplicity parameter value @xmath125 ) .",
    "finally , the ly@xmath6 ew increases as the size of the systems decrease and the colour becomes bluer .",
    "@xcite show that each of these trends at @xmath0 has a @xmath126 significance of @xmath127% .",
    "taken together , these data can be interpreted to show that double nucleated lbgs exhibit ly@xmath6 emission and that the ly@xmath6 emission ew increases as the components become bluer and as the separation between the two components decreases , or in other words , as the overall object size becomes progressively smaller for a given multiplicity .",
    "the sscpair observations are consistent with this behaviour and the interpretation that the sscpairs are interacting bright double nuclei , or two single nuclei lbgs .",
    "the double nucleated sources with larger separations are those discernible as sscpairs in ground - based data , as also indicated by the work of o08 .",
    "diffuse systems , and diffuse systems with multiple fainter clumps , would be observed as single lbgs in ground - based data .",
    "moreover , such systems are lbgs with dominant ly@xmath6 absorption from the law et al . relationships .",
    "strong ly@xmath6 ew and blue continua can be evidence for recent star formation and/or decrease in dust and gas obscuration .",
    "the ly@xmath6 ew of the sscpairs in order of decreasing projected separation is @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "although the sscpairs sample is too small to determine a trend , the sscpairs have similar separations as the double nuclei lbgs in the @xcite sample , have blue colours , and exhibit ly@xmath6 emission with ews that are in the upper quartile of the full lbg sample .",
    "we comment that the work of @xcite does not investigate the behaviour of lbgs with separations larger than @xmath120 kpc .",
    "we probe this regime in  [ close_pairs ] and address statistics applicable to this discussion in  [ ecp ] . in the next section ,",
    "we test the expectations of finding the sscpairs by measuring the distribution of lbg close pair separations in our full survey and a larger survey from the literature and by testing lcdm predictions using a high - resolution cosmological simulation .",

    "the extended ly@xmath6 emission of d3 , ly@xmath6 blob nature , and potential fraction of escaping lyman continuum photons reinforces this scenario . finally , the trends of ly@xmath6 emission with morphological parameters are consistent with a picture where a non - negligible fraction of lbgs produce double - peak ly@xmath6 emission when merging their ground - based 1-d spectra as a result of triggered or more revealed ly@xmath6 emission .",
    "the statistics presented here can be quickly improved from the analysis of other similar existing and future datasets .",

    "the enhanced ly@xmath6 emission from interactions modifies the ratio of elbgs and increases the fraction of detectable elbgs for a given criteria whereas without an interaction they would remain either too faint or too red .",

    "if borne out , the double ly@xmath6 emission / double morphology observable in ground - based data may provide a simple means to identify a significant fraction of interacting galaxies and help to constrain the merger rate at high redshift .",

    "the evidence is presented here to establish a link between the presence of ly@xmath6 in emission and the identification of interacting pairs .    in conclusion , the above picture and the observations of merged 1-d double ly@xmath6 emission profiles in ground - based data as markers of this process",

    "the ly@xmath6 emission peaks and continua in the 2d spectra are spatially offset and exhibit a one - to - one spatial correspondence with continuum flux peaks in the images .",
    "the velocity offsets between the two ly@xmath6 emission peaks of the sscpairs ( before and after angular separation corrections ) are not representative of a random sampling of ly@xmath6 offsets pulled from the lbg population if the two features are generated by two sources within single systems . instead , the ly@xmath6 offsets are in agreement with single ly@xmath6 emission from two separate systems .",
    "4 .   we see evidence for two sets of ism absorption lines ( at a lower confidence level ) in each merged sscpairs spectrum having relative velocities inconsistent with the expectations of the general lbg population but consistent with two separate systems .",
    "in addition , the velocity differences between the ly@xmath6 and ism features assigned to each component of the sscpairs , under the assumption that they are distinct systems , is consistent with typical lbg values .",
    "the high - s / n , higher - resolution @xmath0 lbg spectroscopic sample of @xcite report that four of the nine elbgs in their sample of 14 systems display double - peak ly@xmath6 emission .",

    "we find that an angular correlation function of the form @xmath213 with slope @xmath156 provides an excellent fit to close pair counts for both surveys tested .",
    "the fit incorporates contamination by random interlopers determined from mock catalogues matched to the volume and behaviour of the data .",
    "the slope of the fit to the close pair counts is identical to , or in very close agreement with , the @xmath0 lbg values in the literature derived from angular and spatial clustering statistics .",
    "extrapolation of the fit to below the resolution limit of the photometric data ( @xmath146 @xmath2kpc ) predicts the existence of sscpairs with a similar number and separation distribution to that observed .",
    "\\(3 ) we analyse a high - resolution cosmological hybrid numerical and analytical simulation to assess the expectation of the sscpairs from the predictions of lcdm .",
    "we carefully matched the simulation to the number density , spatial correlation function , spectral and imaging resolutions of the data , and the dimensions of the slitlets .",
    "the analysis finds a prediction of @xmath151 pairs to fall serendipitously in the multi - object slitlets of our survey , in good agreement with the observations .",
    "\\(4 ) we present two laes discovered serendipitously in the mos spectroscopic slitlets which are expected from lae densities at @xmath0 and the solid angle subtended by our slitlets . however , both laes are @xmath9 @xmath2kpc close projected pairs to lbgs .",
    "we confirm one of the laes to lay at the redshift of a nearby lbg and is a bona - fide close pair ( @xmath189 @xmath2kpc ) , whereas the second is only a probable close pair because of the low s / n of the lbg spectrum .",

    "moreover , without exception , _ all galaxies in the sscpairs and all sscpair candidates ( @xmath153 @xmath2kpc ) have dominant ly@xmath6 emission_.    the presence of ly@xmath6 in all sscpairs and sscpairs candidates supports the interpretation that the sscpairs are interacting lbgs under the assumption that interaction may disperse gas and dust and trigger observable star formation . because of the close proximity of the galaxies in the data to each other , the double ly@xmath6 emission / double morphology of the sscpairs provides a useful and consistent diagnostic to help detect interacting close pairs from @xmath215 in similarly obtained existing and future optical ground - based data .",
